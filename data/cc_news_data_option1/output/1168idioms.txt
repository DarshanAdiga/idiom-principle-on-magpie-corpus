Online food and grocery store BigBasket has witnessed a crash in its server due to the overwhelming number of orders placed amid country-wide lockdown due to novel coronavirus, as per media reports. Due to the indefinite lockdown, many citizens are ordering via digital platforms to stock up the ration supplies.                                                                                            According to the company, over the past few days, BigBasket has faced an unprecedented surge in orders and traffic, which has put a corresponding load on their tech systems. As a result, BigBasket’s website and app have been intermittently failing to load for some customers, as per media reports.                                                                                            After the crash, the company has decided to limit access to services to only existing customers. BigBasket told media, "We are currently experiencing unprecedented demand. In light of this, we are restricting access to our website to existing customers only. Please try again in a few hours.” The company also noted that its teams are working on fixing the issue so that customers can place their orders as usual.                                                                                            While putting restrictions on all services, Centre has not restricted sales of essential supplies including ration. It has also asked people not to buy commodities out of panic.                                                                                            Another online platform m.Paani that claims to empower local retailers to take their shops online, has also recorded 20 per cent growth in the consumer base and a 30 per cent increase in the retail services amid the coronavirus epidemic. According to the company’s official release, Over 75,000 grocery and daily goods retailers based out of the Indian metropolis, including Mumbai, Delhi, and Pune, have doubled their sales in the past 15 days.

A decision on whether to postpone this year's Tokyo Olympic Games will be taken in coming days, two sources within the Olympic movement told Reuters on Tuesday. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) and Tokyo Games organisers are under mounting pressure to postpone the Games due to the coronavirus outbreak.


  Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and IOC President Thomas Bach will hold a telephone conference at 1100 GMT to discuss a delay, the IOC said. "Today, the IOC is discussing with the Japanese government, the Tokyo 2020 Organising Committee and the IOC Executive Board about the scenario planning including the postponement of the Games and will communicate in due course," the IOC said.


  The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the IOC and Japan would not take the full four weeks of consultation announced by the Olympic body on Sunday after finally saying that postponement was an option. "A decision will be announced in the coming days. It is not a matter of weeks but days," one source said.


  Another source said it could even come before Japan kicks off its scaled-down torch relay on Thursday in Fukushima, the site of the March 11, 2011, nuclear power plant meltdowns triggered by a huge earthquake and tsunami. The Olympic flame, which flew to Japan last week from Greece, will be carried not by relay runners, but in a lantern in the modified event.


  The IOC and organisers long insisted the Games would go ahead as planned from July 24 but as the virus spread from Asia to Europe and further west, opposition to the Games mounted with athletes struggling with preparations. It would be the first time the Olympics have been moved or delayed during peacetime in their 124-year modern history.


  The outbreak has now infected more than 377,000 people across 194 countries and territories, with over 16,500 deaths. Major sporting powers Canada and Australia have already said they will not be sending teams to Tokyo if the Games go ahead as scheduled this year, and British organisers said they were likely to follow suit after meeting with sporting body representatives on Tuesday.


  The United States has added its weight to calls for a delay and New Zealand pressed for a quick decision.

Controversy enveloped the announcement by the president, especially after he indicated that chloroquine has already been approved for this use by the FDA. The agency's commissioner, Stephen Hahn, MD, quickly clarified that larger studies still need to be conducted to determine the safety and effectiveness of chloroquine for treating COVID-19. Much of the discussion that continued in the media throughout the day concerned whether the drug will truly prove effective and, if so, how long will it be until this medication gets the green light for patient use. There was also confusion as to which drug is under consideration since some reports, and the president himself, made mention of hydroxychloroquine as well. The distinction is important, as will be seen shortly.

Henceforth, though, he would gain a second claim to fame: as the man who took Cruyff out of the Intercontinental Cup.

People needing to travel on domestic flights, trains and Cook Strait ferries to get home before the country moves into level 4 lock-down tomorrow night will be able to continue using the passenger services until midnight on Friday, Transport Minister Phil Twyford said today.Domestic passenger services, particularly ferries, have been inundated with people trying to get home before the original cut-off date of midnight Wednesday for non-essential workers. A decrease in passenger numbers to accommodate level 3 physical distancing measures has reduced the ability of passenger services to carry more people.Phil Twyford said it was unlikely the increased demand could be met before midnight Wednesday.The Government recognizes New Zealanders are trying to do the right thing by returning home ahead of the country moving to level 4.There has been further pressure on domestic passenger services from international tourists who are completing self-isolation and declared COVID- free to move to their final destination in New Zealand.Thats why the Cabinet COVID Committee this afternoon agreed to extend the deadline for non-essential workers and international tourists to keep using domestic passenger services until midnight Friday. After this time, services will only be provided to essential services and workers, including freight services.International travelers will only be allowed to use domestic passenger services to reach their final destination to comply with lock-down requirements.International travelers will only be allowed to use domestic passenger services during the extended period to reach their final destination once they have completed 14 days of isolation and are declared Covid-free.These airplanes, trains, and ferries are expected to implement physical distancing and other protective measures that are appropriate for their services.I want to thank passengers for their patience as we urgently worked through this unintended consequence of the battle to fight COVID-19, Phil Twyford said.With Inputs from New Zealand Government Press Release

Al fin y al cabo, ese tipo de momentos suelen verse como una suerte de momento clave para lanzarse a este tipo de resoluciones. Pero la formación no tiene fecha, especialmente cuando la actualidad y los elementos que rodean el día a día del marketero le obligan a adquirir nuevos conocimientos. Y eso es, en parte, lo que está ocurriendo ahora mismo.                                                                                                                             No pocas personas están aprovechando la cuarentena para adquirir nuevos conocimientos o para mejorar ciertas habilidades. Muchas plataformas de formación han abierto al público cursos y talleres, o han reducido sus costes de matrícula, como una vía para ofrecer a los ciudadanos, que deben quedarse en sus casas y están por tanto atrapados todo el tiempo en ellas, algo que hacer durante las jornadas de cuarentena. Aquellas compañías de formación que tienen a los niños como su público nicho han abierto servicios para ayudar en el proceso de escolarización a distancia en el que todos están sumidos.                                                                                                                             La formación online se ha convertido así en una manera de llenar las horas muertas y hasta, se podría decir, en una herramienta anti estrés y anti ansiedad. Mientras estás aprendiendo y formándote estás centrado en lo que estás haciendo y no en otras cuestiones.                                                                                                                             Para los profesionales del marketing, la publicidad y el diseño, además, puede ser una oportunidad para adquirir conocimientos necesarios que estaban posponiendo o para los que no encontraban su momento. Las ofertas de cursos y formación en marketing online son muy completas y existen muchos cursos de formación especializados que permiten centrarse en áreas muy concretas.                                                                                                                             A los ya existentes cursos gratuitos de marketing que ofrecían diferentes centros, se suman ahora acciones específicas que han puesto en marcha algunas organizaciones para llegar con sus planes de formación a más potenciales interesados. Domestika, una plataforma de cursos para creativos, ha lanzado varios gratis, especialmente aquellos que están pensados para hacer como actividad con niños.                                                                                                                             ## Formación para las necesidades del momento                                                                                                                            La pandemia del coronavirus nos ha puesto a todos en una situación en la que no tenemos experiencia. Es la primera vez que tenemos que quedarnos en casa, en un encierro preventivo para frenar la enfermedad (y los artículos que buscan ejemplos previos se remontan a las epidemias de cólera del XIX o a la de gripe de hace ahora 100 años), y por tanto la primera vez que debemos actuar en este contexto. Nadie tiene conocimientos sobre qué debe hacer, tampoco los gestores de las empresas y sus responsables de marketing.                                                                                                                             Para estos últimos, sin embargo, las decisiones que tomen y los mensajes y acciones que lancen sus empresas se convertirán en un elemento determinante, uno que marcará su imagen pública y la relación que establecerán en el futuro con sus consumidores. El modo en el que se comporten ahora se quedará en la memoria de los consumidores y, en un panorama en el que los valores y las acciones de las marcas se consideran más importantes que nunca, actuar de la forma correcta es decisivo.                                                                                                                             Para hacerlo, los marketeros tienen que operar con ética y sentido común, pero también con conocimientos de gestión de crisis y de respuesta a la misma. Y para lograrlo tendrán que recurrir a la formación y a adquirir conocimientos específicos en este terreno. Al fin y al cabo, no se trata solo de que nadie nació aprendido, sino de que además nadie cuenta con una experiencia previa. No hay casos de éxito que usar como guía.                                                                                                                             Algunos están optando por la puesta en común de conocimientos. La consultora Best, por ejemplo, ha abierto un grupo en Linkedin, al que han llamado Consultorio de comunicación y marketing en tiempo de COVID-19, y que definen como "un espacio en abierto de asesoramiento y consultoría". Reconocen que estos tiempos están llenos de incertidumbre y que de este modo se podrán poner en común las cuestiones relacionadas con las exigencias del mercado.                                                                                                                             Otros optan por adquirir conocimientos que refuercen sus decisiones. IEBS ha lanzado una serie de cursos gratuitos con una temática específica en gestión en crisis. A lo largo de estas semanas sus ponentes están dando formaciones en directo sobre cuestiones como respuesta a mercados en caída, respuesta a la incertidumbre o participación ciudadana.

Evidence of the devastation wreaked on the global economy by the coronavirus pandemic mounted on Tuesday as activity surveys for March from Australia and Japan showed record falls, with surveys in Europe and the United States expected to be just as dire. After an initial outbreak in China brought the world&rsquo;s second largest economy to a virtual halt last month, an ever growing number of countries and territories have reported a spike in infections and deaths in March.Entire regions have been placed on lockdown and in some places soldiers are patrolling the streets to keep consumers and workers indoors, halting services and production and breaking down global supply chains.Mirroring the emptying of supermarket shelves around the world, indebted corporates have rushed into money markets to hoard dollars, with a global shortage of greenback funding threatening to cripple firms from airlines to retailers.&ldquo;The coronavirus outbreak represents a major external shock to the macro outlook, akin to a large-scale natural disaster,&rdquo; analysts at BlackRock Investment Institute said in a note.Purchasing Managers&rsquo; Index (PMI) surveys from Japan showed the services sector shrinking at its fastest pace on record this month and factory activity contracting at its quickest in a decade.Services PMI slumped to a seasonally adjusted 32.7 from February&rsquo;s 46.8 and manufacturing PMI fell to 44.8 from a final 47.8 last month. The 50 mark separates growth from contraction.The survey results were consistent with a 4 percent contraction in the economy in 2020, Capital Economics senior economist Marcel Theliant said. The likely postponement of the Tokyo Olympics is expected to deal a heavy blow to the world&rsquo;s third largest economy. In Australia, the CBA Services PMI fell to a record low of 39.8 as restaurants, cafes and tourism were hit hard by travel bans and cancellations of events and concerts.A separate analysis of card spending data by Commonwealth Bank of Australia showed shopping outside of grocery, alcohol and healthcare was bleak. A weekly consumer confidence gauge by ANZ-Roy Morgan plunged to 30-year lows at 72.2 points.Later on Tuesday, the euro zone composite PMI is expected to come in at 38.8, the lowest since early 2009.&nbsp;US manufacturing and services PMIs are also expected at multi-year lows of 42.8 and 42.0, respectively. Infinite stimulusWith most asset markets tanking, global central banks have been rolling out extraordinary measures on an almost daily basis to stop the rot.In its latest drastic step, the Federal Reserve on Monday promised bottomless dollar funding.For the first time, the Fed will back purchases of corporate bonds, backstop direct loans to companies and &ldquo;soon&rdquo; will roll out a program to get credit to small and medium-sized business. It will also expand its asset purchases by &ldquo;as much as needed.&rdquo;The Fed last week slashed borrowing costs to zero and took other emergency steps to keep the commercial paper, Treasury and foreign dollar funding markets functional.Still, some analysts say infinite monetary policy easing may not be enough and fiscal steps are crucial.&nbsp;The latest US effort on that front remains stalled in the Senate as Democrats said it contained too little money for hospitals and not enough limits on funds for big business.Finance and monetary leaders from the world&rsquo;s 20 largest economies agreed on Monday to develop an &ldquo;action plan&rdquo; to respond to the pandemic that the IMF now expects to trigger a global recession, but offered no specifics.&ldquo;For the US economy to be able to come out of the current crisis and the ongoing recession relatively unscathed, more radical policy interventions will be needed in the next few weeks,&rdquo; Anna Stupnytska, global head of macro and investment strategy at Fidelity International said.Speculation is mounting that data due on Thursday will show US jobless claims rose an eye-watering 1 million last week, with forecasts ranging as high as 4 million.Goldman Sachs warned the US economy could contract by an annual rate of 24% in the second quarter, two-and-a-half times greater than the previous biggest contraction in the period after World War Two. Investors&nbsp;unconvincedAsia is also easing monetary conditions across the board, with the Thai central bank expected to join regional peers in cutting rates on Wednesday.With the Bank of Japan running out of ammunition, the pressure is on the government, which is looking into offering cash payouts to households as part of a package that could be worth more than $276 billion.The Reserve Bank of Australia has flooded the system with nearly $39 billion since March 12.&nbsp;It has also purchased $5.3 billion in government bonds since launching its &ldquo;unlimited&rdquo; quantitative easing programme on March 20.The Australian government also announced a stimulus package of $40 billion on top of the $11 billion flagged earlier this month.New Zealand said on Tuesday that retail banks will offer a six-month principal and interest payment holiday for mortgage holders and small business customers whose incomes have been affected by the economic disruption from Covid-19.&ldquo;Despite aggressive moves by central banks, investors remain unconvinced that any of these actions will be enough to stave off the ill effects from (the virus),&rdquo; ING Asia economist Prakash Sakpal said.

Due to the outbreak of the deadly virus, the world economy at large is under an attack. The Indian economy has also suffered a massive setback due to the pandemic. The stock markets have hit a record rock bottom with a double circuit in a month. As a preventive measure of the lockdown, the government and private sector organisations, have been shut or operating at bare minimum capacity. PM Modi has announced a formation of an Economic Response Task Force that would curb the impact of the outbreak on the economy and will also bail out those citizens who have been affected by the deadly outbreak.

In this film, a Russian poet, Andrei Gorchakov, and his interpreter travel to Italy to research the life of an 18th-century composer. However, during his stay in the Mediterranean nation, the nostalgia of his hometown starts to devastate the mind and emotions of the poet. The slow burn rhythm of the film, also present in other productions of Andrei Tarkovsky, takes over an architecture of damaged and eroded surfaces. It is not hard to seek the phenomenology of a possible interpretation of these interiors marked by the habits of the characters, which reminds the character of how much he misses his hometown.

Expressing concern over the plight of construction workers after the country- wide lockdown over coronavirus, Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Tuesday urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to announce emergency measures, including wage support to those in distress. In a letter to the prime minister, Gandhi said over 44 million construction workers are now faced with a "precarious" future as many of them are stranded in cities and are deprived of livelihood due to the lockdown.


  In a separate letter to the chief ministers of Congress-ruled states, the Congress chief urged them to ensure urgent wage support to construction workers who are now deprived of work due to the restrictions. She said the country is in the midst of the worst global pandemic and this has necessitated stringent measures for containment and management of the COVID-19 transmission.


  "These measures have led to widespread economic disruptions that had a debilitating impact on the informal sector," she said in her letter to Modi. Nearly 500 coronavirus cases have been reported in India so far, according to Health Ministry data on Tuesday.


  As cases of the viral infection surged, authorities have put almost the entire country under lockdown, banning gathering of people and suspending road, rail and air traffic till March 31, to check the spread of the deadly coronavirus. The Congress president said that over the last year, lakhs of migrant workers in major cities across India have left for their home towns and villages fearing a prolonged economic downturn.


  "As the second largest employer in India, over 44 million construction workers are now faced with a precarious future. Many are stranded in cities and are deprived of their livelihoods due to the stringent lock down measures," Gandhi told the PM. The Congress chief said several countries around the world, most notably Canada, have announced wage subsidy measures as part of COVID-19 Economic Response Plan.


  "Considering the extraordinary circumstance, I request you to consider advising the State Building and other Construction Worker's Welfare Boards to roll out emergency measures, particularly wage support to the construction workers who are in distress," Gandhi urged the prime minister. She said the Building and other Construction Workers (Regulation of Employment and Conditions of Service) Act, 1996 provides for various welfare measures for workers.


  The Act also provides for constitution of state welfare boards and the constitution of welfare fund, she said, noting that it is reported that the welfare boards collected cess amounting to Rs 49,688 crore till March 31, 2019. She said only an amount of Rs 19,379 crore had been spent.


  In her letter to Congress chief ministers, she commended their tireless efforts towards responding to the COVID-19 pandemic. This public health emergency has triggered a severe economic downturn that threatens the livelihoods of millions, she noted. "The construction sector is still reeling under the twin blow of demonetisation and GST, and slowdown triggered by COVID-19 is likely to further deepen the crisis. While lakhs of migrant workers fled large cities over the last week due to panic and stoppage of work, many are left stranded due to stringent lockdown measures and closure of public transport. Given their dependence of daily wages, it is important to provide urgent wage support to construction workers who have been deprived of work," she wrote to the CMs.


  "At this juncture, it is critical to ensure that workers are given the benefits they are entitled to under various statutory provisions," she said. State Welfare Boards set up under the Building and Other Construction Workers (Regulation of Employment and Conditions of Service) Act, 1996 have a large pool of unutilised funds collected through the levy of Building and Other Construction Workers Welfare Cess, she told the Congress chief ministers.


  Given that a significant amount of cess lies unutilised, the State Welfare Boards may consider providing wage support to their registered beneficiaries, Gandhi told the chief ministers. Several countries around the world, most notably Canada has announced wage subsidy measures as part of its COVID-19 Economic Response Plan, she said.


  "In light of the extraordinary circumstance, I urge you to advise the State Welfare Boards to take necessary action at the earliest. Kindly keep me informed of progress in this matter," she told the CMs. Gandhi wrote to Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot, Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh, Chhattisgarh CM Bhupesh Baghel and Puducherry CM V Narayanasamy.

Many people from Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar were left stranded at Delhi's Anand Vihar Interstate Bus Terminal on Sunday as the governments of UP and Delhi announced lockdowns to check the spread of COVID-19. According to some travellers, they had boarded trains from Kerala, Goa and several other places after Prime Minister Modi called for a 'Janta curfew' in the country which was to be observed on March 22.


  Ashwin Daniel and Rishab from Uttarakhand said that they had boarded a train soon after the Janta Curfew was announced. They reached Delhi on Sunday morning and have been waiting for buses at Anand Vihar bus stand since then. They added that they had no idea that the lockdown would continue. "I have been stuck here since morning; I have come from Bengaluru and have to reach Uttarakhand. There are no buses available, not even cabs. We have not eaten anything. We were on our way on board a train when the lockdown was announced, what could we have done possibly? I don't know where to go," Ashwin told ANI here.


  "We boarded a train on March 21. If there were plans to announce a lockdown, they should have stopped the last train first, we wouldn't have left Bengaluru then," said Rishabh. Another traveller, Haider Ali, who hails from UP's Pilibhit, told ANI," I have been standing here since yesterday evening, and there are many like me who are stuck here. No bus is available because of the lockdown. We have not even eaten anything since morning. I walked half of my way to Anand Vihar but there is no way through which I can reach home."


  The police also do not let the people stand in groups as the government has prohibited assembly of people. On Sunday, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had announced a complete lockdown in Delhi from March 23 till March 31 for the prevention and containment of COVID-19.


  The state has also imposed Section -144 of CrPC, which prohibits assembly of more than four people. The government said that all shops, commercial establishments, factories, workshops, offices, godowns, weekly markets shall stop their operations and only essential services and establishments have been exempted from the lockdown.


  According to the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, a total of 471 confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported in India. (ANI)

It was on March 24, 2011, when Indian cricketer Yuvraj Singh's heroics ended Australia's hopes of winning a fourth consecutive World Cup title. In the match, India defeated Australia by five wickets to reach the semi-final of the ICC Cricket World Cup.                                                                                                                            This was India's first Cricket World Cup win over Australia in 24 years. Before this game, Australia had defeated India five consecutive times in the ODI World Cup.                                                                                                                            In the quarter-final of the showpiece event the defending champions Australia put on 260 runs on board in their allotted 50 overs. Chasing 261, India had a decent start as openers Virender Sehwag and Sachin Tendulkar put on 44 runs for the first wicket. However, Sehwag (15) got out in the ninth over.                                                                                                                            Tendulkar along with Gautam Gambhir stitched together a fifty run stand. Both Tendulkar and Gambhir played cautiously and hit half-centuries before getting out. In the chase, India kept losing wickets at regular intervals. However, Yuvraj and Suresh Raina's 74 run stand ensured that India won the match with 14 balls remaining.                                                                                                                            Yuvraj played an unbeaten knock of 57 runs from 65 balls. He smashed eight fours, including the winning boundary. The 2011 World Cup was memorable for Yuvraj as he was named the Player of the Tournament.

The Calcutta High Court on Tuesday formed a three-member panel to examine the situation in all correctional homes of West Bengal and prepare a report on the number of inmates who could be granted bail or parole to avoid crowding in jails, in view of the Covid-19 outbreak. A division bench comprising Chief Justice TBN Radhakrishnan and Justice Arijit Banerjee formed the committee with Justice Dipankar Datta, the chairman of State Legal Services Authority, as its head, and sought a report on the correctional homes by March 31.The Director General prisons and principal secretary, home department, are the two other members of the high court-constituted panel. The committee has been asked to propose criteria for granting bail to undertrial inmates and suggest whether prisoners in jail for over 10 years be granted parole under the present circumstances.The high court took up the issue suo moto in light of a Supreme Court direction on Monday, asking all state governments and Union territories to set up high-level committees to determine the class of prisoners who could be released on parole for four to six weeks. The apex court said prisoners convicted of or charged with offences having prison terms up to seven years can be given parole to decongest the jails.It had also said that several prison staff enter the prisons regularly, and so do visitors and lawyers and therefore, there is a high risk of transmission of COVID-19 to the prison inmates. Taking up a separate PIL which sought steps by the state and the Centre to prevent the spread of the pandemic, the division bench on Tuesday did not pass any order after stating that it was satisfied with the actions taken by both the governments in this regard.The court administration has, meanwhile, communicated to its judges and all lower courts in the state a letter by the West Bengal government that sought consideration of bail prayers of undertrial inmates so as to reduce overcrowding in correctional homes, a top HC official said. On a direction by Chief Justice TBN Radhakrishnan, we have forwarded the communication to the judges of the high court and all subordinate courts in the state, Calcutta High Court Registrar General Rai Chattopadhyay said.In the letter, State Advocate General Kishore Dutta requested Chief Justice Radhakrishnan to issue appropriate administrative directions to all the judges in West Bengal, including the judges of the high court, to consider liberally granting bail to undertrial inmates with a view to reduce the correctional home population considering the present novel coronavirus scare. Most lawyers in the state have stopped appearing for hearings following a resolution passed by the West Bengal Bar Council for non-participation in judicial proceedings at the Calcutta High Court and other courts in the state till March 31 in view of the prevailing situation.

PuroMarketing: Noticias de marketing, publicidad y marcas en Español


  En el sector de la publicidad digital, la principal amenaza para marcas y soportes es el fraude digital. En este 'combate', los ciberdelincuentes buscan denodadamente las fisuras en el sistema para lucrarse económicamente de las inversiones en el ecosistema. Recientemente, nuestra unidad de combate contra el fraude digital, Threat Lab, ha emitido recientemente la alerta 404bot. Se trata de una sofisticada red de bots que está haciendo estragos en la industria.


  En esta 'batalla' hay claramente dos bandos bien posicionados. Por un lado, los 'buenos', formado por marcas, agencias, soportes y proveedores de tecnología de verificación o protección de las inversiones en digital. Estos últimos realizan mejoras continuas para hacer frente a posibles amenazas; rastrean, monitorizan, investigan? Y junto a todos ellos, también en esta facción, las organizaciones protectoras del entorno digital, como IAB, que hace años impulsó la creación e implementación en los soportes de los archivos Ads.txt, -aquellos que crean registros públicos de vendedores digitales autorizados y evitan tanto a los vendedores ilegítimos como que se produzcan ventas de inventario no autorizados-. Archivos que se diseñaron con el objetivo de mejorar la transparencia del inventario de publicidad digital. De hecho, su integración en los soportes ha supuesto un descenso drástico del fraude digital.


  En el lado opuesto, el 'oscuro', los criminales cibernéticos. Un eje del mal que está en constante evolución y que busca fisuras en el entorno de la publicidad digital. Y precisamente esto es lo que ha hecho 404bot, que se está sirviendo de obsoletos archivos Ads.txt implementados en los soportes que no han sido auditados. Una vez encontrada la grieta, ¿cómo opera esta red? Generando datos falsos en los navegadores y creando URLs para hacerse con los desembolsos que realizan los anunciantes para sus campañas. Además, su elevado grado de sofisticación le ha permitido operar de modo casi 'invisible', ya que ha sido capaz de garantizar que las suplantaciones de URLs se encuentren fuera de sospecha y del radar de actividad delictiva.


  ¿Y cuál ha sido el impacto en el ecosistema digital de 404bot? Por el momento, hasta lo que conocemos, ha afectado a un buen número de dominios de soportes de diferente tipo y alcance, que cuentan con obsoletos archivos Ads.txt. Nuestra compañía ha estimado que por ahora ha supuesto unas pérdidas para la industria de 15 millones de dólares y que en total 1.500 anuncios de vídeo se han visto afectados.


  Hoy ha sido 404bot. Su proceder nos enseña que es crucial auditar, limpiar y actualizar continuamente los archivos Ads.txt. Pero mañana será otra red, con otro nombre, con un modus operandi más sofisticado aún. El hecho, pienso, ha de hacer recapacitar a todos los actores que formamos parte del sector, para que estemos siempre preparados ante potenciales amenazas y tengan los recursos necesarios para minimizar al máximo el impacto que pueda generar el fraude digital. Dicho de otro modo, que se cuente con la defensa necesaria, que tiene nombre propio; la verificación, para hacer frente a esta amenaza, contra la que si no se cuenta con los medios de protección para protegerse puede lucrarse de las inversiones en digital.

Expressing concern over the plight of construction workers after the country-wide lockdown over coronavirus, Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Tuesday urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to announce emergency measures, including wage support to those in distress. In a letter to the prime minister, Gandhi said over 44 million construction workers are now faced with a precarious future as many of them are stranded in cities and are deprived of livelihood due to the lockdown.In a separate letter to the chief ministers of Congress-ruled states, the Congress chief urged them to ensure urgent wage support to construction workers who are now deprived of work due to the restrictions. She said the country is in the midst of the worst global pandemic and this has necessitated stringent measures for containment and management of the COVID-19 transmission.These measures have led to widespread economic disruptions that had a debilitating impact on the informal sector, she said in her letter to Modi. Nearly 500 coronavirus cases have been reported in India so far, according to Health Ministry data on Tuesday.As cases of the viral infection surged, authorities have put almost the entire country under lockdown, banning gathering of people and suspending road, rail and air traffic till March 31, to check the spread of the deadly coronavirus. The Congress president said that over the last year, lakhs of migrant workers in major cities across India have left for their home towns and villages fearing a prolonged economic downturn.As the second largest employer in India, over 44 million construction workers are now faced with a precarious future. Many are stranded in cities and are deprived of their livelihoods due to the stringent lock down measures, Gandhi told the PM. The Congress chief said several countries around the world, most notably Canada, have announced wage subsidy measures as part of COVID-19 Economic Response Plan.Considering the extraordinary circumstance, I request you to consider advising the State Building and other Construction Workers Welfare Boards to roll out emergency measures, particularly wage support to the construction workers who are in distress, Gandhi urged the prime minister. She said the Building and other Construction Workers Regulation of Employment and Conditions of Service Act, 1996 provides for various welfare measures for workers.The Act also provides for constitution of state welfare boards and the constitution of welfare fund, she said, noting that it is reported that the welfare boards collected cess amounting to Rs 49,688 crore till March 31, 2019. She said only an amount of Rs 19,379 crore had been spent.In her letter to Congress chief ministers, she commended their tireless efforts towards responding to the COVID-19 pandemic. This public health emergency has triggered a severe economic downturn that threatens the livelihoods of millions, she noted. The construction sector is still reeling under the twin blow of demonetisation and GST, and slowdown triggered by COVID-19 is likely to further deepen the crisis. While lakhs of migrant workers fled large cities over the last week due to panic and stoppage of work, many are left stranded due to stringent lockdown measures and closure of public transport. Given their dependence of daily wages, it is important to provide urgent wage support to construction workers who have been deprived of work, she wrote to the CMs.At this juncture, it is critical to ensure that workers are given the benefits they are entitled to under various statutory provisions, she said. State Welfare Boards set up under the Building and Other Construction Workers Regulation of Employment and Conditions of Service Act, 1996 have a large pool of unutilised funds collected through the levy of Building and Other Construction Workers Welfare Cess, she told the Congress chief ministers.Given that a significant amount of cess lies unutilised, the State Welfare Boards may consider providing wage support to their registered beneficiaries, Gandhi told the chief ministers. Several countries around the world, most notably Canada has announced wage subsidy measures as part of its COVID-19 Economic Response Plan, she said.In light of the extraordinary circumstance, I urge you to advise the State Welfare Boards to take necessary action at the earliest. Kindly keep me informed of progress in this matter, she told the CMs. Gandhi wrote to Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot, Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh, Chhattisgarh CM Bhupesh Baghel and Puducherry CM V Narayanasamy.

BOSTON -- Massachusetts' youngest residents, their parents, and the workforce that cares for them began facing a new landscape Monday, when early education providers across the state were officially shuttered under an emergency order.


  The order Gov. Charlie Baker issued last Wednesday -- one of several aimed at stemming the spread of the new coronavirus and promoting social distancing practices -- temporarily closes all early education providers across the state, effective from 11:59 p.m. Sunday until at least April 6.


  Baker's order allowed for the operation of emergency child care programs with priority access to such programs for "vulnerable children and children of families who work to maintain the health, safety and welfare of all Commonwealth residents."


  For early education providers and workers, the last few days have been a period of transition, ironing out what an emergency model looks like, what steps can be taken to protect the health of staff and families, and how to ensure the system is ready to return to full operations after a closure that could potentially last beyond two weeks.


  "We're in an unknown world," Bill Eddy, executive director of the Massachusetts Association for Early Education and Care, said in an interview.


  The trade association for private, community-based early education programs and before- and after-school providers in Massachuestts, Eddy's group represents more than 600 early education centers, school age providers and 43 family child care systems.


  Eddy said there are "two real questions" facing the system as it shifts into "shutdown mode."


  "How many children are there really that parents will choose, this is what they want to do?" he said. "The second question is, can we find enough early educators that will work to really staff these centers? We hope so."


  On Saturday, the state published a list of more than 300 center-based and home-based providers that will operate on an emergency, drop-in basis for instances "when all other non-group-care settings have been exhausted and families have no other options."


  "We expect more to come online eventually, but this needs to be implemented safely and the sites should only really be used as a last resort," Baker said in a Saturday press conference.


  The list includes contact information and hours of operation, along with a note advising that priority will be given to groups including "health care workers, essential state and human service workers, COVID-19 health workers, grocery store employees, emergency response personnel, law enforcement, transportation and infrastructure workers, sanitation workers, DCF-involved families, and families living in shelters."


  Eddy said the groups of children he's most concerned about are the children of first responders, the children of essential health care employees and the "8,000 children in this commonwealth who are in our care because they are in the custody of the Department of Children and Families" due to abuse and neglect.


  "The most stable aspects of their lives are the 10 and a half hours they spend in our programs," Eddy said, referring to DCF-involved children. "Those are the ones we really, really want to keep an eye on."


  He said his group is suggesting that providers reach out to those children and their families to see if there's any way possible they remain in their early education program.


  "We feel some sort of special mission that we need to be the stability, we need to be the safety net for those children, and we want to make sure they're not lost in this tough climate," he said.


  U.S. Reps. Katherine Clark, Joseph Kennedy III and Ayanna Pressley were among a group of Congress members who wrote to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy on Friday, asking for an investment of at least $21 billion in child care funding to states as part of a third stimulus package.


  Citing a National Association for the Education of Young Children survey of more than 6,000 providers that showed 30 percent would not survive a closure of more than two weeks, the lawmakers said that more providers will be forced to permanently close their doors the longer the crisis lasts.


  "Moreover, providers who stay open to support essential workers in health care, grocery, transportation, and other critical industries often lack the resources necessary for additional cleaning supplies, staff hazard pay, substitute teachers, paid sick leave, and health-related training," they wrote.


  Eddy said there is a key difference between the Massachusetts early education system and the other two components of the state's education secretariat. While the workers in public K-12 schools and public higher education are public employees, early education is typically provided through private, community based programs.


  "At the end of the day, if we have to lay off all our early educators if the rates aren't paid, we're looking at a tough system to rebuild," he said.

"The conventional system had an operator, hydraulics, pulleys and chains, and this system may have the pulleys and chains, but you need a laptop computer sometimes now to dial in to it and fix it, and the sensors on these lines are maybe 10 or 15 times greater than the conventional systems," he says. "So it has been a challenge to keep the maintenance staff and operations group up to speed with this different mindset, and to find maintenance technicians with that skill set, because it's a lot different than it was 20 years ago."

BOSTON -- Massachusetts' youngest residents, their parents, and the workforce that cares for them began facing a new landscape Monday, when early education providers across the state were officially shuttered under an emergency order.
 The order Gov. Charlie Baker issued last Wednesday -- one of several aimed at stemming the spread of the new coronavirus and promoting social distancing practices -- temporarily closes all early education providers across the state, effective from 11:59 p.m. Sunday until at least April 6.
 Baker's order allowed for the operation of emergency child care programs with priority access to such programs for "vulnerable children and children of families who work to maintain the health, safety and welfare of all Commonwealth residents."
 For early education providers and workers, the last few days have been a period of transition, ironing out what an emergency model looks like, what steps can be taken to protect the health of staff and families, and how to ensure the system is ready to return to full operations after a closure that could potentially last beyond two weeks.
 "We're in an unknown world," Bill Eddy, executive director of the Massachusetts Association for Early Education and Care, said in an interview.
 The trade association for private, community-based early education programs and before- and after-school providers in Massachuestts, Eddy's group represents more than 600 early education centers, school age providers and 43 family child care systems.
 Eddy said there are "two real questions" facing the system as it shifts into "shutdown mode."
 "How many children are there really that parents will choose, this is what they want to do?" he said. "The second question is, can we find enough early educators that will work to really staff these centers? We hope so."
 On Saturday, the state published a list of more than 300 center-based and home-based providers that will operate on an emergency, drop-in basis for instances "when all other non-group-care settings have been exhausted and families have no other options."
 "We expect more to come online eventually, but this needs to be implemented safely and the sites should only really be used as a last resort," Baker said in a Saturday press conference.
 The list includes contact information and hours of operation, along with a note advising that priority will be given to groups including "health care workers, essential state and human service workers, COVID-19 health workers, grocery store employees, emergency response personnel, law enforcement, transportation and infrastructure workers, sanitation workers, DCF-involved families, and families living in shelters."
 Eddy said the groups of children he's most concerned about are the children of first responders, the children of essential health care employees and the "8,000 children in this commonwealth who are in our care because they are in the custody of the Department of Children and Families" due to abuse and neglect.
 "The most stable aspects of their lives are the 10 and a half hours they spend in our programs," Eddy said, referring to DCF-involved children. "Those are the ones we really, really want to keep an eye on."
 He said his group is suggesting that providers reach out to those children and their families to see if there's any way possible they remain in their early education program.
 "We feel some sort of special mission that we need to be the stability, we need to be the safety net for those children, and we want to make sure they're not lost in this tough climate," he said.
 U.S. Reps. Katherine Clark, Joseph Kennedy III and Ayanna Pressley were among a group of Congress members who wrote to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy on Friday, asking for an investment of at least $21 billion in child care funding to states as part of a third stimulus package.
 Citing a National Association for the Education of Young Children survey of more than 6,000 providers that showed 30 percent would not survive a closure of more than two weeks, the lawmakers said that more providers will be forced to permanently close their doors the longer the crisis lasts.
 "Moreover, providers who stay open to support essential workers in health care, grocery, transportation, and other critical industries often lack the resources necessary for additional cleaning supplies, staff hazard pay, substitute teachers, paid sick leave, and health-related training," they wrote.
 Eddy said there is a key difference between the Massachusetts early education system and the other two components of the state's education secretariat. While the workers in public K-12 schools and public higher education are public employees, early education is typically provided through private, community based programs.
 "At the end of the day, if we have to lay off all our early educators if the rates aren't paid, we're looking at a tough system to rebuild," he said.

The 84th Senior Badminton National Championships scheduled to be held in Lucknow from April 27 to May 3 has been put on hold due to the dreaded COVD-19 pandemic, Badminton Association of India (BAI) said on Tuesday. The coronavirus outbreak has claimed 16,000 lives worldwide, while infecting close to 4,00,000. India has reported nine deaths and nearly 500 positive cases so far.                                                                                                                            Given the situation, BAI has asked all state secretaries not to book their tickets for Lucknow. "We have put on hold the 84th Senior nationals badminton Championships and 75th Inter State - Inter Zonal in light of the coronavirus outbreak. We have advised the state secretaries not to book any ticket for the Lucknow event," Ajay Singhania told PTI.                                                                                                                            "There is a lockdown in the country till March 31st to flatten the virus curve and we can't put our players or officials at risk. We will take a call on the tournament on April 1 as and when the government comes up with a new advisory." 	 The BAI had asked the members of the executive council to give their views on the conduct of tournament and most have called for its postponement. In India, 32 states and union territories have been put in lockdown. Two states - Punjab and Maharashtra - and a UT - Puducherry - have declared curfews.                                                                                                                            "These are difficult times and we need to give priority to health. We have to wait till March 31 to see what happens, the BAI will take a call and accordingly we will see when can we conduct the tournament," UP Badminton Association secretary Arun Kakkar said. Saina Nehwal and Sourabh Verma are the defending champions, having won the women's and men's singles titles respectively at Guwahati last year.                                                                                                                            The Badminton World Federation has suspended all tournaments till April 12 due to the Covid-19 epidemic, which has brought the whole world to a standstill with countries shutting down borders and going into lockdown mode. The BAI has also urged its players and officials to "keep a positive frame of mind" and "stay home" to contribute in the fight against the deadly COVID-19 pandemic.

A decision on whether to postpone this years Tokyo Olympic Games will be taken in coming days, two sources within the Olympic movement told Reuters on Tuesday. The International Olympic Committee IOC and Tokyo Games organisers are under mounting pressure to postpone the Games due to the coronavirus outbreak.Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and IOC President Thomas Bach will hold a telephone conference at 1100 GMT to discuss a delay, the IOC said. Today, the IOC is discussing with the Japanese government, the Tokyo 2020 Organising Committee and the IOC Executive Board about the scenario planning including the postponement of the Games and will communicate in due course, the IOC said.The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the IOC and Japan would not take the full four weeks of consultation announced by the Olympic body on Sunday after finally saying that postponement was an option. A decision will be announced in the coming days. It is not a matter of weeks but days, one source said.Another source said it could even come before Japan kicks off its scaled-down torch relay on Thursday in Fukushima, the site of the March 11, 2011, nuclear power plant meltdowns triggered by a huge earthquake and tsunami. The Olympic flame, which flew to Japan last week from Greece, will be carried not by relay runners, but in a lantern in the modified event.The IOC and organisers long insisted the Games would go ahead as planned from July 24 but as the virus spread from Asia to Europe and further west, opposition to the Games mounted with athletes struggling with preparations. It would be the first time the Olympics have been moved or delayed during peacetime in their 124-year modern history.The outbreak has now infected more than 377,000 people across 194 countries and territories, with over 16,500 deaths. Major sporting powers Canada and Australia have already said they will not be sending teams to Tokyo if the Games go ahead as scheduled this year, and British organisers said they were likely to follow suit after meeting with sporting body representatives on Tuesday.The United States has added its weight to calls for a delay and New Zealand pressed for a quick decision.

From 1990 onward, there were numerous reports of “attack-of-angle” sensors (i.e., sensors that resemble weather vanes) being damaged by bird strikes, ground equipment and jet way collisions. In 2008, an A320 demonstration flight crashed on the French coast, killing all seven on board. Moisture inside two of the plane’s three angle-of-attack vanes froze. This relatively high incidence number makes it more than justifiable to question Boeing’s decision to enable the sensors on the Max model to become empowered beyond merely warning pilots of potential stalls and to instead automatically force a plane’s nose down.

Officials have now largely turned their attention to the threat of the virus returning from abroad, with almost all new cases being recorded among passengers travelling in from overseas. Beijing, Shanghai and other major cities have ordered mandatory 14-day quarantines for all returnees, mainly in hotels and other government-designated locations where those staying must pay their own way. Exceptions are allowed in some cases, including for those living alone, who must quarantine themselves at home.


  Determined to slam the door on the crisis, starting Wednesday, Beijing will also require everyone arriving from overseas to be tested for the coronavirus in addition to being quarantined.


  In a notice published online Tuesday, Beijing city authorities said those who have entered the capital within the last 14 days will also undergo mandatory testing.


  “Currently, the imported risk from the epidemic’s rapid spread overseas continues to rise,” said the Beijing notice.


  China’s National Health Commission on Tuesday reported 78 new coronavirus cases, among which 74 were imported.


  At the same time, the government is pushing efforts to kick-start the world's second-largest economy and put money in the pockets of workers who have gone weeks without salaries. While most of Beijing's world-famous tourist sites remain closed, parts of the Great Wall have reopened and some restaurants were reopening for business on the condition that customers do not sit facing each other.


  The government says work has restarted on about 90% of major public construction projects across the country, excluding Hubei. While many migrant workers remain trapped by travel bans, industrial production has also restarted, including in the crucial auto manufacturing industry, which is largely based in Wuhan, and in businesses that provide critical links in global supply chains.

That Cruyff did not go on to score a hatful that day is perhaps down to one Dante Mircoli. The tough-tackling Rome-born forward at that point had spent seven years with Independiente, and in 1972 had become only the second European to win the Libertadores after Estudiantes' Croatian forward Christian Rudzki. Henceforth, though, he would gain a second claim to fame: as the man who took Cruyff out of the Intercontinental Cup.

OTTAWA - One in five Canadians weren't taking the deadly COVID-19 pandemic seriously as recently as last weekend, a new poll suggests.                                                                                                                            In a Leger poll conducted between Friday and Sunday, 16 per cent of respondents said the crisis was partly blown out of proportion and another four per cent believed it was blown way out of proportion.                                                                                                                            As well, 16 per cent said the crisis was having no impact on them going out to stores, restaurants or other places; 17 per cent said it was having no impact on the social distance they're keeping from others; and 21 per cent said it was having no impact on visits with friends and family.                                                                                                                            Nine per cent said they were still planning to let their kids play outside with other children.                                                                                                                            While the poll suggests the vast majority of Canadians were taking the crisis seriously and abiding by government advice to stay home as much as possible, Leger executive vice-president Christian Bourque says the 20 per cent who weren't taking it seriously could jeopardize nationwide efforts to curb the rapid spread of the respiratory virus.                                                                                                                            "That 20 per cent of people must go down if we want to collectively achieve the objectives of flattening out the curve," Bourque said in a interview, referring to the goal of keeping the number of COVID-19 cases from overwhelming the health care system.                                                                                                                            The poll, conducted for The Canadian Press, surveyed 1,508 adult Canadians randomly selected from its online panel. Leger's internet-based survey cannot be assigned a margin of error because online polls are not considered random samples.                                                                                                                            Various provincial governments have begun threatening to impose hefty fines on individuals and businesses that flout orders to close or keep at least two-metres distance from other people. A number of premiers have expressed outrage over Canadians who congregated in parks and on beaches over the weekend while others held house parties or otherwise socialized in groups beyond their immediate family.                                                                                                                            There have also been instances of individuals refusing to self-isolate for 14 days after travelling abroad or not abiding by quarantines after testing positive for COVID-19.                                                                                                                            Bourque said governments have little choice but to crack down when one-fifth of the population does not appear to be taking the crisis seriously.                                                                                                                            The poll suggests that 18-34 year olds were most likely to think the crisis is overblown — 27 per cent compared to 14 per cent for those 55 years of age or more.                                                                                                                            But on all other questions, Bourque said the poll found little difference among age groups, including on the level of fear people are feeling.

The Calcutta High Court on Tuesday formed a three-member panel to examine the situation in all correctional homes of West Bengal and prepare a report on the number of inmates who could be granted bail or parole to avoid crowding in jails, in view of the Covid-19 outbreak. A division bench comprising Chief Justice TBN Radhakrishnan and Justice Arijit Banerjee formed the committee with Justice Dipankar Datta, the chairman of State Legal Services Authority, as its head, and sought a report on the correctional homes by March 31.


  The Director General (prisons) and principal secretary, home department, are the two other members of the high court-constituted panel. The committee has been asked to propose criteria for granting bail to undertrial inmates and suggest whether prisoners in jail for over 10 years be granted parole under the present circumstances.


  The high court took up the issue suo moto in light of a Supreme Court direction on Monday, asking all state governments and Union territories to set up high-level committees to determine the class of prisoners who could be released on parole for four to six weeks. The apex court said prisoners convicted of or charged with offences having prison terms up to seven years can be given parole to decongest the jails.


  It had also said that several prison staff enter the prisons regularly, and so do visitors and lawyers and therefore, there is a high risk of transmission of COVID-19 to the prison inmates. Taking up a separate PIL which sought steps by the state and the Centre to prevent the spread of the pandemic, the division bench on Tuesday did not pass any order after stating that it was satisfied with the actions taken by both the governments in this regard.


  The court administration has, meanwhile, communicated to its judges and all lower courts in the state a letter by the West Bengal government that sought consideration of bail prayers of undertrial inmates so as to reduce overcrowding in correctional homes, a top HC official said. "On a direction by Chief Justice TBN Radhakrishnan, we have forwarded the communication to the judges of the high court and all subordinate courts in the state," Calcutta High Court Registrar General Rai Chattopadhyay said.


  In the letter, State Advocate General Kishore Dutta requested Chief Justice Radhakrishnan to "issue appropriate administrative directions to all the judges in West Bengal, including the judges of the high court, to consider liberally granting bail to undertrial inmates with a view to reduce the correctional home population considering the present novel coronavirus scare". Most lawyers in the state have stopped appearing for hearings following a resolution passed by the West Bengal Bar Council for non-participation in judicial proceedings at the Calcutta High Court and other courts in the state till March 31 in view of the prevailing situation.
