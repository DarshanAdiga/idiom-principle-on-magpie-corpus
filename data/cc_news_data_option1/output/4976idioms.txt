Dr Oliver Dray, a 26-year-old doctor at Mid Cheshire Hospitals NHS Foundation and one of the young professionals taking part in the campaign, spoke to CheshireLive.
 On the challenges he and his colleagues faced during the pandemic, Oliver said: "The first wave I was working in A&E. I'd already spent four months there, so I'd sort of seen A&E for what it was normally and then I volunteered to stay for another four months to help with the pandemic.
 "The day-to-day job changed, the way A&E was structured to try and take on people without COVID, they were streamlined elsewhere.
 "I am quite young, quite junior, two-and-a-half years in. I suppose it was just getting to grips with how adaptable you had to be, how things were evolving each day, how there was so much unknown.
 "A lot of the things we've learned in the text book and by two years you've seen quite a lot, but you've never even thought you'd be involved in a pandemic like this where the guidance is changing, there was so much unknown about immunity, there were so little treatment options.
 "So I think it has been challenging, but I can only commend the team I work with, how brilliant they were with their leadership and communication and making sure the staff were on board."

Post-match is really interesting because Dusty attacks after the bell ostensibly to get the pop for the hero wronged, but the crowd is just SILENT through the entire ass-kicking. As far as MSG is concerned, Dusty lost fair and square. It was no-DQ and he still fell short. So they just don't care that he's beating up Graham afterward. 3 for 5 because these guys let it all hang out and they were both in their primes.

The 23-year-old Darnold has also had two separate two-game stints on the sideline because of shoulder injuries. Add that to him missing three games last year because of mononucleosis and three games as a rookie with a foot injury, and the quarterback has only now played the equivalent of just over two NFL seasons at 33 games.
 “Yeah, I mean, it’s frustrating for both of us,” Gase said. “I think he’s trying to do everything he could possibly do. It’s hard to control the injury situation this year and last year. Also, like, mono? I mean, if you’re in Vegas, that’s not one you’re probably betting on. No offseason, short training camp (this summer) — would’ve loved to have had a lot of that time to work with him on a lot of different things.”
 Darnold looked rusty in the 20-3 loss to Miami last week, and made some of the same mistakes that have overshadowed the sometimes — but not often enough — brilliant plays that have flashed.
 Gase has been impressed by Darnold’s work ethic — “it’s phenomenal” — and the youngster’s ability to tune out the outside chatter. The talk that he’s not good enough, and the hype surrounding Lawrence and the potential of him becoming the next Jets quarterback.
 “We’ve had conversations about just focusing on the moment and not worrying about two weeks from now, five weeks from now, four months from now,” Gase said. “Control what you can control, which is preparing for the game on Sunday and performing well. I think that’s probably easier said than done. At 23, he can say, ‘Yeah, I’ve gotcha.’
 “It’s probably way harder than what he portrays.”
 To his credit, Darnold never flinches or appears flustered when speaking to reporters. He has shown time and again that he has the mental ability to handle the spotlight of playing in New York — and for a franchise that hasn’t seen a Super Bowl since the glory days of Joe Namath in 1969.
 That’s 51 years and counting.

 As California’s reopening led to a summer surge of the virus, some counties openly resisted putting into place prevention measures, prompting the governor to establish an enforcement task force just before the Fourth of July.
 Through November, the task force levied more than $2 million in fines to businesses and carried out 4,366 enforcement actions, including 179 citations and three revocations of business licenses. The other actions were mainly warnings.
 In addition, counties have sued churches and schools for violating coronavirus orders. Fresno County obtained a preliminary injunction against a Christian school, Immanuel, for returning to in-person classes in August in violation of state orders. Both Los Angeles and Santa Clara counties obtained court orders against churches for defying health orders.
 The state restrictions limiting attendance at religious services had been upheld by a federal judge, but Thursday, the U.S. Supreme Court vacated his ruling and asked him to reconsider in light of its recent decision to end restrictions on houses of worship in New York.
