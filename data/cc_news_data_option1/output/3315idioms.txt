Ideal zum Abschluss der Feiertage, die Bibelfilmparodie der britischen "Monty Python"-Anarchisten. Weil sich die drei Weisen im Stall irren, huldigen sie nicht Jesus, sondern Brian. Von nun an ist dieser Opfer von Irrtum und Verwechslung. Nach einer aberwitzigen Odyssee endet der vermeintliche Messias am Kreuz – und singt: "Always Look on the Bright Side of Life"… Gotteslästerung? Nö, hier bekommen nur Fanatiker ihr Fett weg!

New Super Lucky's Tale has an interesting story behind it. Originally a VR hit as Lucky's Tale, it later hit the Xbox One as Lucky's Tale with revamped graphics and more polish. That version still wasn't quite what it needed to be though, and the Switch release saw so many improvements made that it was retooled as New Super Lucky's Tale - where the game got rave reviews. Now, after a period of exclusivity, New Super Lucky's Tale is set for a wider release on the Xbox One and PS4. This means that it will now be available on all consoles, and the PC via the Microsoft Store, Epic Games Store, and Steam as well. Xbox Game Pass users can download the game now as part of their membership, while Game Pass Ultimate users can enjoy the game on both PC and Xbox One.

She also found the perfect lead in Julia, and she’s surrounded her with deeply talented people in front of and behind the camera. We really have everything we need to make a great show — I just wish I could see it all right now!”
