By January 1917, the citizens of Abilene, while still wanting to stay out of the war if possible, began to recognize that war just might be coming. With Germany’s declaration of unrestricted warfare, the sinking of the Lusitania and other ships with Americans on them, Germany’s actions in Belgium (invading a neutral country and killing innocent civilians), and the soon to be published Zimmerman telegram (Germany’s promise to support a war on the United States by Mexico) a growing sense of anger and willingness to go to war began to take hold throughout the United States.
 Even so, President Woodrow Wilson still tried to find a peaceful solution to the war and tried to put himself forward as a mediator between the countries at war. Both sides, though, largely pushed his advances aside in the belief that the war would be won shortly.
 The Abilene Weekly Reflector on January 18, 1917, in light of President Wilson’s inability to arbitrate a peace, stated that “Now that Christmas is over why wouldn’t Santa Claus be the proper person to settle the war in Europe? All nations recognize him impartially.” Unfortunately, as time would go on to show, this proposal was also not taken seriously by the combatants.
 War looms
 As war appeared to loom on the horizon, the Abilene Weekly Reflector of Feb. 8, 1917 argued that “papers that are getting excited over a possibility of war with Germany should keep calm. Does not Wilson keep us out of war? Surely he will not fail just because election is over!” President Wilson had run for reelection in 1916 under the slogans “he kept us out of the war” and “a vote for me is a vote for peace.”
 In another article in the same issue, the Abilene Weekly Reflector also argued that while Americans “…desired to keep from any direct connection with the European war…” they also needed to recognized that “…if the worst comes and we are involved in active fighting, such as Europe is now carrying on, then the United States will ‘do its bit’ with its money and its men.”
 The Abilene Weekly Chronicle concurred in an article on March 7 stating that “we do not want war, if it can honorably be avoided. We will suffer some loss from injustice in the interest of peace. But we are not a nation of cowards!”
 While entering the war was undesirable and that much should be done to preserve the peace, the citizens of Abilene needed to prepare for the worst and support their country no matter the outcome.

They also want a 15 per cent increase to the maximum Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program food stamp benefits. The joint request reflected input from committee chairs and a broader swath of Democrats, with lawmakers representing districts with large minority populations being particularly concerned about whether the benefits of the small business subsidies are reaching their communities.
 Republicans swiftly countered that Democrats were blocking fast action on the small business aid. Many of the Democratic requests revisited behind-the- scenes battles from the round of talks that produce the CARES Act two weeks ago.
 “Senate Democrats should drop their shameful threat to block this funding immediately," said Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, a member of GOP leadership. "Our small businesses desperately need help — now.”
 On the call with Pence, Republicans also expressed concerns the small business assistance would be held up by the Democrats' push for additional aid, said another Republican unauthorized to discuss the call and granted anonymity.
 Mnuchin requested an additional $250 billion for a just-launched small businesses payroll program, which has been swamped with applications.
 Part of the sweeping $2.2 trillion package that became law just two weeks ago, the $350 billion Paycheck Protection Program has been flooded as businesses rush to apply for up to $10 million in forgivable loans to keep paychecks flowing amid the stay-home shutdown.
 With Congress all but shuttered amid the virus outbreak, passage of any measure will require bipartisan co-operation.
 The House and Senate could deploy procedures that would allow a simple voice vote, without a roll call, or leaders could try to approve the package with unanimous consent.
 Consent, though, seems unlikely, as Democrats push for add-ons and fiscal hawks criticize the cost. Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., objected to the earlier package, forcing lawmakers to return to Washington for a vote.
 One leading Democrat, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, has also raised alarms about equity reforms that she said need to be made swiftly amid the rocky rollout of the small business program.
 Millions of small business owners “have been put through hell over the past two weeks as they scrambled to try to get access to the money they desperately need,” Warren tweeted.
 Minority-owned businesses and others are facing setbacks in applying for the aid, Democrats said.
 “Congress also needs to dramatically simplify PPP so it actually works,” Warren tweeted. “Ensure that banks provide equal access to all borrowers — and do it NOW.”

“About 60% of our positive outcome for the animals goes through no-kill rescues; those have completely stopped taking animals from shelters. We are still working with one no-kill rescue in the state of Kentucky, but that’s it,” he said. “Typically, we work with anywhere from 31 to 35 rescues a month.”
 Miller said their adoption rate had dropped 75% in the last month. They are still providing animal control services for emergencies, but he said everything is scaled back.
 Right now, the Humane Society has only dogs available for adoption. There are 30 dogs available.
 Although adoption rates have dropped, Miller implores people to look at Facebook and see if there is a dog for their families. And if not, then share their pictures through social media.
 “You can always share our pictures of the animals, those pictures on our Facebook Page are updated weekly,” he said. “Though you may not be able to adopt, someone out there could be looking for that animal, which could definitely save lives.”
 The Humane Society is also in need of donations. They particularly need bleach and other cleaning supplies.
 “My rule of thumb is if you can use it at your house, then we can use it at the shelter,” Miller said. “However, we are not accepting any textile donations at this time.”
 Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Humane Society is only available through appointments, which includes owner surrenders, stray drop-offs and animal viewing. Appointments can be set from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m. Tuesdays, Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays.
 If you would like to donate to the Hopkins County Humane Society, you can bring your donations to the gate at their facility, which is located at 2210 Laffoon Trail in Madisonville. At the entrance there is a donation bin. The bin is checked daily. Miller said if you need a receipt for your donation, or to start the adoption process, contact their office at 270-821-8965 or email them at hopkinscohs@gmail.com.

What happened? According to Rosemary Gibson of The Hastings Center and author of the book “China Rx,” “Industry data reveal that Chinese companies formed a cartel, colluded to sell product on the global market at below market price, and drove all U.S., European and Indian producers out of business.”
 When European firms tried to sell their penicillin ingredients in China, they got a characteristic Chinese welcome: The government, Gibson writes, “imposed high trade barriers, charged astronomical fees for product testing, and held foreign firms to a higher standard than domestic ones.”
 Just like that — it’s not so easy to simply start up a penicillin fermenter — we were out of the penicillin-production business.
 The story of penicillin is the tale of U.S. dependence on China-sourced pharmaceuticals and active drug ingredients writ large.
 From 2010 to 2018, U.S. imports of pharmaceuticals from China increased 75%. China is the second largest exporter of drugs and biologics to the United States behind Canada, and our dependence is even greater, given that China is the source of the active ingredients of many drugs produced elsewhere. India, another major source of drugs for the U.S., gets about 75% of its active ingredients from China.

“At this point, if we stay home, this thing will be over a lot faster than if we go test the waters,” Willard said.
 Among other concerns, the experts said, is that you might maintain distance while hanging out with your friend, but touch objects such as doorknobs that have the virus on them. Or you might accidentally pass by or even bump into someone else while outside.
 There are also concerns about how well people can even maintain the physical distance, the experts said.
 Are you sure you’re able to stay at least 6 feet away? Will you be able to tell exactly how far apart you are?
 “There are going to be people who will push that to the limit,” said Judith J. Lightfoot, chief of infectious disease at Rowan University’s School of Osteopathic Medicine.
 Lightfoot also worried that some people won’t be able to help themselves. Being near a close friend or loved one, they might want to get closer.
 “Don’t tempt it,” she said. “Don’t try to say, ‘Well, OK, I can just get closer to you.’”
 Staying 6 feet apart, the experts said, is for when you have to go outside and be near other people. But the higher priority is to stay at home and not be exposed to others in the first place.
 Better to err on the side of caution, they said.
 “That’s the whole thing with ‘social distancing’ — the word social means ‘Oh, I can be social as long as I stay away.’ No. We don’t know enough about this virus,” Willard said. “If folks are telling us to stay home, we need to listen to them.”
 “And it is hard. I mean come on, it’s going to be gorgeous out there. It’s hard to stay home,” she said. That doesn’t mean go to the park with friends. Her suggestion: “Take a drive.”

 These bees nest in hollow stems, earth banks or old beetle holes in dead wood and aren’t aggressive, so they are fine around children and pets.
 Solitary bees are different to honey bees and bumble bees, they don’t have a queen or hive, they live alone and they don’t produce honey.
 Bees will cocoon themselves into your bee hotel and lay their eggs and larvae in there, you’ll see them poking their heads out.
 There’s lots of ways you can make a bee hotel, either using a terracotta pot or you can buy alternatives online.
 One of the easiest ways to do it without ordering anything new is using a mug.
 Zoologist Hannah Stitfall showed us how to make a great bee hotel last week.

 “Your momma warned most of y’all not to touch lots of things with a six foot pole,” Bubba J advised. “I’m amending momma’s rule and extending it to six foot, six inches. That’s doubling yore chances to stay safe.”
 “And the next time a police officer tells you to touch you nose or eyes with the tip of your finger, tell ‘em Dr. Oz said that ain’t safe to do no more. And if you’re wearing a mask to be safe, cover your nose and mouth but not your eyes. I gotta go now. I’m getting tested for anybody’s. Somebody might need my plasma.”
 Bubba J gets an E for effort but an F for math and science.
 As I came into town Friday morning I saw an oncoming SCHOOL BUS! I hadn’t seen one of those in a while.
 For a second I wondered where that bus was going and then I realized it was headed out to College Hill Church to pass out free breakfast/lunch sacks for kids. God bless the city and county schools for helping feed kids!
 The suspended 2019-2020 school year will certainly be one for the books.
 For more than a century parents have been asking their children,“what’d you learn in school today?”
 When Pontotoc High School graduate Luke Hatcher was in kindergarten I remember asking him that question one day. Luke replied, “Don’t run, don’t talk, don’t break line.” He had mastered the three Ds.
 I’m praying that school will come again this fall and at some time the senior classes of 2020 will be recognized and honored.
 But just because school’s not in session right now it doesn’t mean that young people have stopped learning. They are watching what is happening with the coronavirus and they are listening to every word.
 The school of life is in session for every human being on God’s planet. The recent daily and nine weeks tests have been tough and they’re getting tougher every day.
 What grades are each of us making in this world gone crazy? What are our kids seeing and hearing from us?
 Most of the folks who were tested by WWII are gone. So many in that generation paid with their lives and millions lost loved ones. For years there was no normal, but Americans prayed for help, strength and mercy. They pulled together, sacrificed, shared and got back to their feet time and time again. They endured.
 But over the past 75 years many of those hard earned and hard learned lessons have been lost.
 The wars in Korea and Vietnam and the Middle East turned life upside down for millions of families.
 The terrorist attacks on American soil on September 11, 2001, were unprecedented. Thousands were killed in those attacks. Many thousands more still suffer with the mental and physical pains inflicted by the attacks. Thousands were infected with cancer by the debris fallout from the World Trade Towers.
 We prayed when the buildings crumbled. Maybe some prayed for the first time in a long time. In Washington, U.S. Senators and Congressmen joined together and sang “God Bless American” on the steps of the Capitol.
 In the following months and years American citizens and leaders vowed to learn from our mistakes. We realized how vulnerable we really were and we vowed “never again.”
 At some point we stopped remembering a lot of those vows. Rules, regulations and precautions were forgotten. Senators and Congressmen stopped holding hands.
 The rekindled call for “buy American” faded out. Many companies crawled into bed with China because labor was so cheap and bigger profits could be made.
 For decades I’ve been writing a story each year about the flu. The U.S. averages between 26,000 and 60,000 deaths a year from influenza. But only during the peak of the virus does it make headlines. But still, each year thousands have learned the lesson of just how deadly it can be.
 For months now a new invisible predator, coronavirus, has been stalking the streets and countryside of America.
 As I write this on Monday the U.S. has 347,003 confirmed cases of coronavirus and it has killed 10,335 people. Days ago medical experts warned that the coronavirus has the potential to kill 100,000 Americans—maybe even twice that many.
 Thousands of doctors and nurses have been tirelessly battling this pandemic, but we’ve learned that many thousands more medical personnel are needed.
 In many cities hospitals are overrun by the sick and dying.
 We learned that we don’t have enough ventilators.
 We learned that PPE is an acronym for personal protective equipment. We learned we need millions and millions more pieces of PPE, including N95 masks, gloves and shields.
 We learned that when there’s money to be made a 95-cent mask soon costs $7.00. We learned that when increased cash money is involved many masks go outside of our country instead of supplying America’s needs first.
 We learned that 90 percent of pharmaceuticals are manufactured in China.
 We’ve learned that even with hard work and effort it takes many weeks to mobilize massive emergency medical response across America.
 We learned that air travel, spring break and Mardi Gras helps fan the spread of the coronavirus pandemic.
 We learned that when panicked, a fearful public can empty grocery stores, warehouses and even Amazon.
 During 9/11 we learned how courageous and self-sacrificing our first responders are. We had forgotten some of that in recent years. Shame on us.
 In recent months we are re-learning just how brave and tireless our doctors, nurses, medical technicians, police, firemen and emergency personnel are. There are none better in the world.
 We are learning just how important medical researchers are.
 We’ve learned that our Army Corp of Engineers can erect hospitals better than the Chinese.
 We’ve learned we need a vaccine for coronavirus and many of the smartest medical folks in the world are right here in the U.S. and they’re working night and day to unlock, test and perfect such a vaccine. But we’ve also learned it may take another 12 months.
 We’ve learned once again we need to stop depending on things made outside the United States. But oh how we love a bargain and profit (I’m guilty too).
 We’ve learned that we need the availability of millions and millions more tests. We’ve learned we need the results much faster than 5 to 7 days.
 We’ve learned that our booming economy has come to a screeching halt. We’ve learned millions are out of work.
 We’re still learning that it’s going to take time.
 We’re learning just how good we had it. We’re learning just how precious freedom really is. We’re learning what’s really important.
 We’re learning that we can stop, be still, and look around to see just who needs helping.
 We’ve learned that achievement tests are important, but not absolutely necessary. Many kids are learning that they miss going to school. We’re learning how important teachers really are (and always have been).
 Kids may be out of school but they’re still learning life’s lessons. They’re learning from us.
 Will we pass or fail?
 And how quickly will we forget lessons learned again?
 On Easter Sunday Christians around the world will celebrate the resurrection of Jesus Christ.
 Maybe at noon on Good Friday Americans could stop and sing “God Bless America.” Your kids could learn the words from you.

The crisis hit home for Brown, president of the Motion Picture Costumers Local 705. His sister, a nurse in Winston-Salem, N.C., had sent him a photo of her son waving goodbye to his dad through a window — a necessary physical separation because her radiologist husband was exposed to COVID-19 at work. Medical providers, she said, faced a severe shortage of masks and other protective equipment.
 Brown was determined to do something. So he took to Facebook and put out a “call to arms,” rallying 250 designers, sewers and cutters to make masks for healthcare providers and others.
 “It breaks my heart,” Brown said, his voice breaking in a phone interview from his home in Los Angeles. “So I have a personal reason for doing this as well.”
 The motion picture industry has been decimated by the coronavirus crisis, which has halted film and television productions worldwide. More than 100,000 cast and crew have lost work and are turning to relief packages set up by unions, independent Go Fund Me efforts and various Hollywood foundations.
 With no end in sight to the crisis, costumers — whose job is to create and fit costumes for actors on sets — are plying their sewing and design skills to help address the very real shortages of face masks and other protective clothing among medical workers.
 “Nobody is working right now, so everybody needs a purpose; everybody needs something positive to focus on,” Brown said. “We have the skills and the talents to make this happen.”
 Brown’s local and others within the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees union have mobilized an army of costume and wardrobe workers to fashion face masks from donated fabric and other materials. L.A.-based costumers already have produced 3,500 to 4,000 cloth masks for healthcare providers, the union estimates.
 And they have been working with UCLA to create a higher-quality medical-grade prototype that their sewers can make quickly and in large numbers.
 “IATSE has been functioning as a true partner to UCLA Health during our crisis response efforts,” Becky Mancuso-Winding, executive director of strategic community and business relations at UCLA Health, said in a statement.
 Brown wasn’t alone in his desire to help. After 15 years as a costume designer, Lauren Oppelt was about to try her hand at directing her first short film when the pandemic came.
 With time on her hands, she had noticed from the various sewing groups she belonged to that some people had already started making masks.
 “I don’t have anything else to do,” the Los Feliz-based designer thought. So she made a mask and posted a picture of it on Instagram. Requests for more masks came flooding in.
 One came from a childhood friend, an ER doctor in San Francisco, telling her of the urgent need for masks and other personal protective equipment.
 She launched a group called “Mask Crusaders”, which now has about 100 members. The group includes sewers, “runners” who gather fabric, and volunteers who collect donations of money and materials. She then teamed up with the Costume Designers Guild (Local 892) to help deliver the masks.
 “We are not running out of places to send them to,” Oppelt said. “I didn’t know what an N95 was two weeks ago.”

The series of initiatives taken by the government to mitigate farmers' marketing-related woes in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic looks good on paper. The most notable among these moves include asking the states to restrict the jurisdiction of the mandis run by the agricultural produce marketing committees (APMCs) to their physical premises for three months and declare warehouses as deemed agricultural markets. It has also mooted permitting Farmers' Producer Organisations (FPOs) to trade directly through the electronic National Agricultural Market (e-NAM) without taking the stocks to the market yards. The underlying objectives of these measures, quite obviously, are to encourage out-of-mandi transactions of farm goods and deferred sale by farmers by keeping their produce in the recognised warehouses, thus, decongesting the mandis during the Covid-19 crisis. Additionally, these moves would facilitate an unhindered supply of farm commodities to bulk buyers, retail chains, and agro-processors without over- burdening the regular marketing infrastructure, which is handicapped due to the paucity of labour, transport, and other necessities.

 "There must not be any cover-up or underreporting just for the sake of keeping the number of new cases at zero," he has said since late March. "All subnational governments must release epidemic information in a fact-based, open and transparent manner."
 The strict instructions suggest that there are indeed such cover-ups and underreporting taking place.
 The euphoria over what was touted as "great success in containing the plague" is now being replaced by a sense of caution.
 "The lifting of the Wuhan lockdown was slowed down, and the central government has returned to a policy of caution after Premier Li talked about prohibiting doctored statistics and fake reports," said a source familiar with university affairs in China. "The reopening of schools nationwide has also been postponed."
 The Chinese leadership today is torn between whether to continue to concentrate its efforts on containing infections and persevere in a prolonged battle against the virus or shift its focus to revitalizing its virus-hit economy through a bold easing of restrictions on people's movements.
 President Xi Jinping, China's top leader, seeks to kill two birds with one stone by achieving both simultaneously. But his natural inclination is to shift to economic reconstruction. This has been clear since late February, when China began to trumpet the success in containing infections.
 For Xi, this year's economic performance is especially important as he enters a critical run-up to the Chinese Communist Party's next national congress in 2022, where he seeks to stay in office and form a new team of leaders around him. Next year is also a big year as it marks the centenary of the party's establishment.
 The first step for Xi to put the economy back on track is to convene the National People's Congress at a relatively early date so that he can turn the nation's focus fully on economic reconstruction.
 If he is to do so, China needs to see no new coronavirus cases for a certain period of time. It is highly possible that the politically savvy local bureaucrats, fully aware of Xi's needs, lined up to report rosy numbers.
 Premier Li has a different perspective. He has been put in charge of the Central Leading Group on Responding to the Novel Coronavirus Disease Outbreak.

The problem of matching the supply of potentially available medical students with the complex particular needs of hundreds of thousands of healthcare workers is a classic example of the “two-sided market,” as it is known in business and economic thinking. Building these two-sided markets is a notoriously difficult challenge for startups because each side of the market is essentially useless and uninterested without the other. In this case, the platform would not be helpful to healthcare workers without an ample supply of students, but it could also prove challenging to attract substantive student interest without demonstrating to them that they’d be responding to a concrete need.

 PRATT -- Teaching yoga face-to-face has rounded out Pratt Community College instructor Trisha Jackson's schedule.
   
 Three years ago, along with teaching physics, geology, and atmospheric science, Jackson, who holds a Ph.D. in geology from the University of Kansas and teaching credits in yoga, decided to offer yoga. But a few weeks ago, her world turned upside down, along with the rest of the world's.
   
 Because of the coronavirus shutting down schools and many businesses, she and her children, dogs and husband are all under one roof.
   
 Jackson decided the tumult would not suit a video conferencing platform interchange with her students. So she opted for a YouTube and discussion board approach.
   
 Jackson trusted yoga practitioner Adriene Mishler and her YouTube yoga videos, "Yoga with Adriene" to help her with her class. Mishler's website states, "Yoga with Adriene provides high quality practices on yoga and mindfulness at no cost to inspire people of all ages, shapes and sizes."
   
 "My students are familiar with her," Jackson said. "She has an amazing library of actions."
   
 Jackson assigns three practices of Adriene's for her students to watch and do. She then has discussion boards online where her students are to answer questions about their practice with Adriene.
   
 "Last week, I selected pieces that dealt with loneliness and change," Jackson said. "This helped them deal with stress."
   
 Jackson asked her students to reflect on several poses and write how these poses changed or did not change how they felt after the pose. Each student was also asked to explain why particular poses were effective.
   
 Jackson was concerned this way of teaching would hurt the community spirit of her class. However, she quickly realized her students, who include traditional students, faculty, staff and community members, remained engaged.
   
 "One of the best things about our class is the sense of community," Jackson said. "I really enjoy the sense of connection and how they are sharing and responding."
   
 As for teaching geology and physics labs, Jackson is taking these classes one week at a time.
   
 "There are some good simulation materials out there," she said. "But it doesn't capture all those kids that don't learn well in an online atmosphere."

Keeping up with the news from one source or another, you may have developed a sense of hope that the pandemic will eventually be controlled in one way or another. That’s the bright side. On the dark side, it would appear that our customary political bias from one media source or another will continue to thrive as its own form of a pandemic; especially when its toxicity is promoted by an eminent anchor of a national network, who professes to be a devout Christian, asks the Vice-President that when he talks to God, “do you find yourself worrying at all that people you represent and care deeply about have died and will die who did not need to because steps the federal government did not take soon enough?” Simple question to the agenda driven media in light of all the “sickness” in the world, where do you think healing should begin?

A study conducted by scientists at the University of Arizona revealed that cellphones harbor 10 times more bacteria than most toilet seats.
 While this may come as a shock to some, the discovery truly shouldn't be that surprising. After all, the average American touches their phone 47 times per day, which gives microorganisms ample opportunity to hitch a ride on your mobile device.
 Regardless, your phone doesn’t have to be the germ factory that it currently is. This portable UV sanitizer can keep your phone clean, and it's on sale for only $37.95 today.
 The cellphone UV sanitizer makes cleaning your phone ― and keeping it clean ― easy. You just insert it into the sanitizer, turn it on, and the device uses UV rays to safely eliminate 99.9 percent of the harmful germs that have taken up residence. And, it works fast, too, as the entire cleaning process takes just 15 minutes to complete.
 Sure, you could use alcohol wipes instead. But those wipes can have difficulty reaching into every crevice that may be present on your phone or its case. The UV sanitizer does these things with ease. And it’s portable too, so you can take it with you to make sure your device stays clean wherever you go.
 Keeping your phone clean won't have to break the bank. The Cellphone UV Sanitizer is on sale for only $37.95 today, nearly 25% off its usual price.
