There is continued optimism regarding the long term future.


  “We look forward to a recovery stage and rebounding cargo shipments as the nation contemplates relaxing shelter-in-place orders, people return to work and consumer demand rises – however it will not be in the short term,” said Mario Cordero, Executive Director of the Port of Long Beach.


  Commercial Real Estate


  Shane Young of Marcus & Millichap reports that in light of COVID-19, there is still some positivity in the commercial real estate market.


  Young observed, “Collections for most local apartment landlords have been 95%+, which is much better than expected. With the uncertainty in the market, lenders have pulled back on financing so debt isn’t quite as attractive as it was pre-COVID.”


  “That is limiting how aggressive buyers can be on price, however we have clients who are still selling and in doing so we are still able to achieve their end goal of increasing income, getting rid of management responsibilities, or building their portfolio locally.”

On Tuesday, Southwest said that new bookings are beginning to outpace cancellations, which could signal a turning point for the company and industry. Reduced capacity, significantly lowered revenue forecasts, and an unknown resolution to the current situation will lead to a turbulent ride for the stock, regardless of how enticing the valuation looks today. Southwest Airlines has had a stellar operating history, but there's just too much uncertainty in the near-term to add the stock to your portfolio.

In terms of the second question about the 15%, 16% constant currency growth. I think it is pretty much in line with what we've seen the likes of EPAM comment on in terms of their guide for the next quarter. And I think also in terms of the globe and the guide, I think they were guiding at something like 13-odd percent on a reported sort of basis. So, I don't think we're out of kilter with what others are seeing.

  O'Connell said that there was no damage to the plaques in this incident.

Disney+ is already the home to _A Playdate With Destiny_ , this year's short which ran in front of prints of _Onward_ , the Pixar film starring Chris Pratt and Tom Holland. Both the short and _Onward_ itself were rushed to Disney+ early in the pandemic, shortly after stay-at-home orders closed most American theaters.


   _Playdate With Destiny_ follows Maggie on a trip to the park. When she faces peril on the playground, Maggie is saved by a heroic young baby, who winds up stealing her heart. She can't wait to see her beloved on the following day, but things don't go quite as she planned.


  As it turns out, _Playdate With Destiny_ was originally conceived as part of a story for an episode of _The Simpsons_ , but was eventually turned into its own short film.

  "It started because two of our writers, Tom Gammill and Max Pross, pitched the basic idea as part of a Simpsons story [for the show] a couple of years ago," _The Simpsons_ executive producer Al Jean said in an interview earlier this year. "When we did the episode, [executive producer] Jim Brooks thought they could turn that part into a theatrical short. So, we delayed the episode."


   _The Simpsons_ airs on Sunday nights on Fox. The first 30 seasons of the long-running animated primetime comedy are available to stream on Disney+.

What this survey suggests, though does not explicitly say, is that for many travelers, a summer vacation may be simply out of the question this year. According to the most recent numbers from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the unemployment rate soared to 14.7% in April. More than 20 million jobs were lost that month alone, and the very real economic hardships many people are enduring may be adding to the number of travelers who are putting off leisure travel right now.

They stood at the white altar on her parents’ driveway, in the exact spot where Chase Smith had parked his truck to pick up Sadie Mills for their first date.


  That spot on the driveway where the two 18-year-olds now stood to exchange their wedding vows was the same spot where six months before they’d shared their first kiss, full of sweet teenage love and new beginnings.


  As Chase watched Sadie come toward him in her simple white dress, he shook his head, smiled and then started crying.

Just as it is in baseball, there’s a code of retaliation in NASCAR. In Sunday’s Coca-Cola 600 at Charlotte Motor Speedway, we’re sure to find out whether Elliott accepted Busch’s apology or not.
 Elliott has his passionate fans — he’s the two-time reigning honoree as the Cup Series’ most popular driver. Busch, meanwhile, has his Rowdy Nation. If their cars do tangle at Charlotte, that’s only a good thing for the sport because NASCAR NEEDS these types of big-time driver rivalries to further elevate this league.
 And so what if there were no fans inside Darlington Raceway? NASCAR wasn’t originally supposed to be camped out at Darlington this week, anyway. We’ll count on fans packing those stands for this Labor Day Weekend’s Southern 500.
 This week has been about more than the fans. This has been about more than just NASCAR — and even sports.
 While UFC and the Professional Bull Riders had already resumed their leagues, this was time for NASCAR to step in with its first Cup race Sunday in seemingly like forever while other stalled major professional sports leagues were looking on.
 Sunday’s race was a step, and it was a strong, solid step forward — with more 6.32 million viewers on television, for good measure, as the Real Heroes 400 also put the spotlight on Sunday’s true celebrities: Those medical frontline workers risking their lives to try to put an end to this pandemic.
 Meanwhile, on the track, history was made as Darlington became the first to host two NASCAR Cup points-paying races in one week.
 One week? How about in four days?
 Darlington served as a gracious host when NASCAR needed it most. Leave it to the raceway’s staff to not think about the small time window to make this happen.
 As nerve-racking as it has to have been, track President Kerry Tharp and his staff simply made it happen.
 Of course, for those who live around here, we’re by no means surprised.

TPG surveyed over 2,390 adults in the U.S. about how the coronavirus outbreak has affected their outlook on future travel. Of the 31% who are comfortable with the idea of a summer vacation this year, about 13% are holding off until late in the season. But a majority (17%) are eager to dust off their suitcases, and said they'd be ready to hit the road in early summer — or sooner. Of those earnest travelers, 8% surveyed said they're ready to take a vacation right now.

One child’s depiction of life during coronavirus is a photo of three people in the kitchen. Essentially stuck together in a small space, two of them stare at screens while the other is cooking.


  The photo, taken by Savannah LaPorte, a sixth-grader at Agua Caliente Elementary School, is the result of working with a professional photographer who helped hone her technique.


  The pair came together through the CommunityShare Educators Fellowship program, which partners teachers with creative types in the community — artists, engineers, musicians and more — who serve as mentors, project designers, content-area consultants, guest speakers and field trip sponsors.


  But when the coronavirus erupted in Tucson, forcing schools to close, the teachers and community partners involved in the program didn't follow suit. They quickly adapted projects and plans to fit the new virtual learning landscape.

Our adjusted profit before tax for the three months ended March 31st, 2020, was GBP 16 million, compared to GBP 13.2 million for the same period last year, a 21.1% year-over-year increase. Our adjusted profit before tax margin was 17.4% for the three months ended March 31st, 2020, 9compared to 18.1% for the same period last year. The year-over-year decrease in our adjusted profit before tax margin is mainly due to a bad debt charge during the quarter of approximately 3% of revenue arising from our review of the client base, in light of the current economic uncertainty created by COVID-19. This charge has an equivalent 3% negative impact on our adjusted profit before tax margin.
