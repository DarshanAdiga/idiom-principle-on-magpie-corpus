Misguided US policy towards Shia-led countries in the Middle East (Iran, Iraq, Syria) was pushing the region towards instability, we warned back in January. But despite the rhetoric, neither the U.S. nor Iran wanted a genuine military confrontation (the Soleimani assassination not withstanding). Now both the U.S. and Iran are struggling to deal with their own domestic outbreaks of the coronavirus, meaning that both sides have even less incentive to go to war with one another. At the same time though, a significant coronavirus outbreak in Iraq and Syria could deal real blows to two countries struggling to pick up the pieces and stabilize themselves, which U.S. policy wasn't helping them do in the first place.

COOS BAY — Leading the way, as she had all season, was Meghan Holloman.
 Southwestern Oregon Community College’s Holloman brought in postseason basketball awards as she was named to the Southern Region all-defensive team in addition to earning a spot on the NWAC’s Winter Sports Academic Excellence list.
 The Academic Excellence list is reserved for sophomores who have at least a 3.25 GPA and have taken at least 36 credits.
 “What do you say about Meghan as a sophomore,” said SWOCC head coach Jeff Johnson after the last home game of the season. “She’s a coach on the court for me. She does all the little things. She’s that glue type of person.”
 Holloman, who missed seven games with a broken bone in her hand, averaged 2.5 steals per game which was eighth best in the NWAC.
 Joining Holloman in the awards was teammate Kealani Neves who was named to the Southern Region’s second team. Neves averaged 16.8 points per game on the season with a season-high 35 in an upset win over Lane Community College.
 SWOCC’s Jasey Ramelow and Katie Pearce were also honored for Winter Academic Excellence.

Yeah, right. I have one server who has two kids and an autoimmune situation, and she didn’t want to work anymore, which is totally understandable, so I took her off the schedule. And another that had school and stuff, so she said she preferred to not work. So there’s a couple of people who didn’t want to be in the building whatsoever. And then our other people just kind of had to, because they needed the money. And maybe because they weren’t as concerned as I was. I removed a lot of the barstools, and I tried to space the tables out more, but, I mean, at the end of the day, I don’t think that really helped. Especially with the volume of people that were coming in. It was actually getting busier and busier. Saturday and Sunday were kind of slow, we were closed Monday. Tuesday night and Wednesday day were actually quite busy, and I was like, “ _How is it getting busier, it should be scaling down.”_ Yeah. All week the business kind of escalated, and it was pretty clear that it wasn’t a good idea to have an open space for folks.

If you've been around the board gaming scene since 2008, you've played a deck- builder. In that respect, Dale of Merchants is comfortably familiar. You have a few starting cards — although more on those in a moment — and there's a marketplace of additional cards to purchase, which gradually fill out your deck with new options. If you run out of cards to draw, you shuffle your discards back together to create a new pile to draw from. Sometimes you'll want to prune the weaker cards out of your deck, other times you'll want to chase particular combinations, and it's a newcomer who buys everything that looks nifty. That's how you wind up with a flabby stack of cards that don't do what you need them to.

Back in January, we flagged that as bad as the tech war between the U.S. and China had the potential to become, there was worse yet to go as this split between China and the U.S. would spill into other economic areas. Coronavirus has sped up that timeline considerably; manufacturing and services sectors have already been forced to begin reorganizing supply chains and staff given their exposure to China. Those moves, for the time being, are temporary, but the longer the current global health crisis holds, the more businesses will be forced to consider making these moves permanent, deepening the divide between the U.S. and China.

 Several Eastern North Carolina beaches have closed their public access points in an effort to reduce the spread of COVID-19.
   
 Emerald Isle announced Thursday in a press release they would be closing their public beach parking areas through March 31. Public restrooms are also closed during this time period.
   
 This announcement came a day before the first case of the coronavirus was confirmed in Carteret County. A second case in the county was announced just hours after the first.
   
 Emerald Isle also issued a State of Emergency for the town on Thursday and following a similar message from Carteret County, stated they are discouraging visitors to the coast at this time. The Town of Cedar Point followed suit, declaring a State of Emergency and also discouraging visitors to the town for the time being.
   
 Emerald Isle Town Manager Matt Zapp explained in an email to The Daily News that the decision to close public parking was done in an effort to reduce the spread of COVID-19 and to align the town with the county.
   
 "For a community anchored in hospitality, this is a very difficult message to send and share," Zapp wrote. "In alignment with Carteret County, the Town of Emerald Isle made the declaration to discourage travel to the coast for the safety of all."
   
 Locations include:
       The Western Ocean Regional Access (WORA)   The Eastern Ocean Regional Access (EORA)   Station Street Park   Third Street Park     
 Those who disregard the order will be parked illegally and receive appropriate citations, according to Zapp.
   
 As spring arrives and the weather begins to warm up, Zapp wrote the number of visitors to Emerald Isle will increase. While normally this is a welcomed site, "these are not normal times" and the town's highest priority now is the health and safety of the community.
   
 "Please take social distancing seriously and help us all reduce the possible community spread of COVID-19," Zapp wrote.
   
 Town officials will be reviewing their closures and restrictions to make changes to the schedule if it becomes necessary, according to Zapp.
   
 Surf City announced on Friday they are "taking additional proactive measures" by closing all public beach access sites, public parking areas, and town parks. The closures will remain in effect until the town rescinds them.
   
 The town also urged all businesses and residents to follow N.C. Gov. Roy Cooper's orders for the health and safety of the community.
   
 "We ask for your understanding and cooperation as we continue to address this evolving situation," the town wrote.
   
 The North Topsail Beach Board of Aldermen met Friday, however no restrictions against visiting the beach or the public access points were ordered.
   
 Mayor Pro Tem Joann McDermon issued a revised State of Emergency for North Topsail Beach, but no additional restrictions were added to the declaration. The revised declaration includes a summary of several mandates contained in N.C. Gov. Roy Cooper's recently issued Executive Orders.

Dale of Merchants does something both simpler and more elegant by removing points entirely. Oh, there are still numbers on the cards, important for purchasing new items. But here the numbers pull double-duty. Rather than hoarding as many cards as possible, you really only need a handful. Enough to stock the shelves of your cute woodland store. You need eight stacks, but the catch is that each stack must be numbered higher than the one before it. And because cards max out at a value of five, that means you'll soon need to pile cards together — and piles require matching suits.

Latin America was in political crisis even before coronavirus, with a newly- created middle class demanding better public services and less corruption from their leaders and not getting them. As of this writing, Latin America has yet to be hit as hard from Coronavirus as Asia and Europe, but that may be just a matter of time. Combined with the recent collapse of oil prices following Russia and Saudi Arabia's decision to enter an oil-price war, leaders of oil- producing countries like Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador and Mexico need to brace for some difficult weeks ahead; so too the rest of Latin America, whose health system and underlying infrastructure will be tested like never before in the coming weeks and months… all while a population already on edge watches on.

Relations between the private and public sector have rarely been easy. But as the world's problems began to mount and governments struggled to keep up, people began looking to multinational corporations (MNCs) to help address many of the issues that were plaguing the societies in which these multinationals operated and extracted profit. Before coronavirus, we expected 2020 to be a year when these MNCs would face calls for more action on social issues like climate change and the battle against poverty, all while they struggled to satisfy shareholders in a slowing global economic environment. That slowing global economy remains a massive challenge for them given coronavirus and new supply chain worries, but for the time being governments have other worries aside from holding MNCs to account; what's more, the challenges coronavirus brings offers opportunities for tech companies and pharmaceuticals to step up and help people live their lives as normally as possible during these trying times. Call it a wash.

SWEETWATER COUNTY — If there’s one phrase that best describes the spirit and resolve of Sweetwater County, it is “can-do.” Ever since our forebears first came to this area, we have always striven to make this special neck of the woods (or maybe the desert!) a better place. And that is especially true when it comes to neighbors, friends and co-workers reaching out to help one another in times of real need.
 For the last 25 years, thousands of residents have come together to lend a helping hand as Cowboys Against Cancer volunteers. Whether they donate time, money, a special auction item, or attend the yearly benefit dinner held the first Saturday in November, Sweetwater County residents have time and time again stepped up to the plate with a generosity unparalleled in the Intermountain West.
 Cowboys Against Cancer (CAC) is the brainchild of Margaret Parry, president and founder. When she was diagnosed with cancer in the early 1990s, she spent countless hours traveling to Salt Lake City for treatment. Those seemingly never-ending trips made her realize there was a real gap in the assistance available to area cancer patients—especially paying for the costs not covered by medical insurance such as hotels, gas, and food.
