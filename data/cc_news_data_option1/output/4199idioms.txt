Lowcock said the Sahel is the only region in the world where all the U.N. indicators of human development are getting worse.
 He called for more girls to go to school and stay there, a reduction in infant and maternal mortality, and improvements in clean water availability.
 Lowcock said there must also be a recognition that traditional livelihoods in the Sahel -- subsistence agriculture and nomadic livestock grazing -- “will not support the number of people there will be in the region in the decades ahead, not least because of climate change.” As an example, he pointed to the evaporation of major environmental assets like Lake Chad, which is now a “shriveled puddle.”
 More than 100 countries have moved from largely subsistence-based rural agriculture economies over the past few hundred years to economies developed in relation to cities, so there are models for Sahel countries to use in dealing with these problems, “but at the moment, they’re not being taken up in an effective way,” he said.
 Lowcock said he fears that in Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger as well as three other Sahel countries — Cameroon, Chad and northeast Nigeria — there is a risk of “a tipping point” where “it starts to get dramatically more difficult to deal with the underlying causes.”
 “It’s a bit like a snowball rolling down the hill,” he said, pointing to a twentyfold increase in the number of displaced people between 2018 and 2020 from 70,000 to 1.5 million in Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger while his year has seen the worst floods ever recorded in the region and the highest number of people in need of humanitarian assistance.
 He also noted there has been a record level of attacks on aid workers this year and extremist groups have expanded their areas of operation. There must be a recognition that extremist groups have an agenda that “is inimical to the interests or livelihoods of ordinary people in the places they control,” he said.
 “These are not problems that can be solved in the short term, but until you face up to them, recognize what you’re dealing with, and start talking about what the solutions can be, obviously you’re not making any progress,” Lowcock said. “So you don’t get to choose where you have to start the journey, but you do have to take the first steps.”

The game started off with a turnover as Cedar Hill’s kickoff team was able to strip and recover the ball from Aledo. The Longhorns were able to mix up the pass and run game and keep the Bearcats on their toes. Quarterback Kaidon Salter was locked in from the start of the game. He was able to lead his team and evade defenders as he threw the ball right over the top of a defensive lineman and into the hands of Julian Austin for a touchdown. Salter or should I say Houdini was able to find his men down the field for 241 yards, 3 touchdowns and ran for 128 yards on the ground. His guys not only play for him but they believe their destiny is winning a state title.

After days working outside together, the couple likes to unwind together. Gladys might choose something to read from her extensive library of over 1,500 books while Marion watches sports on television, or they both might sit together circling words in a word search puzzle.
 Thinking about reading and fishing, Gladys shared, “My daughter just released a book called ‘Anthology of Inspiration,’ and she wrote me this poem, ‘A Well- Dressed Mom.’”
 “My mom doesn’t like to wear makeup, and jewelry is not her thing. She would rather wear a smile while fishing with Dad in the spring. My mom doesn’t care about the latest fad or fashion trend. She is really more interested in what’s biting up around the bend,” she read.

"The beauty of this procedure - why it is so great and cutting edge - is that you can restore an area that has no cartilage left by putting in a patient's own normal cells," Barker says. "When it's all done, it's a completely normal knee."
 The downside is that the treatment requires two procedures - one to remove the cells and a second to put them back - and a long, restrictive recovery period that can take as much as a year before full function returns. Initially, the patient must lie flat in bed (hooked up to a continuous passive motion machine to prevent scar tissue from forming) for as long as six weeks to allow the cells to adhere to the bone and proliferate.
 "Those cells are like newborn babies in there," says Nicholas DiNubile, a Pennsylvania orthopedic surgeon. "If you put weight on them, they won't grow."
 Oates, who underwent the implant on Sept. 8, spent six weeks flat on his back in bed. He has since progressed from two crutches to one, and hopes to be using a cane before the end of the month. He's also wearing a straight leg brace for the next few months.
 Full recovery - which includes a gradual return to easy daily activities, followed by moderate moves, such as walking or pool running, and then full sports functioning, such as running - takes nine to 12 months following surgery. But experts believe the alternative is worse.
 When the lesions are left untreated, they become larger, often causing damage on the other side of the knee, "and that's essentially arthritis," says Barker, who also is a team physician for the Carolina Hurricanes hockey team and North Carolina State University.

It was September of 1814. The British had sacked Washington and torched the White House. The conflict became known as the War of 1812, even though it was in its third year.
 The British had also taken prisoners, including a popular doctor from Prince George's County in Maryland. A friend of the doctor sailed on a ship flying a truce flag to negotiate a prisoner exchange with the Royal Navy.
 The mission was successful; British commanders agreed to free the doctor. But while on the ship, the man - a 35-year-old lawyer named Francis Scott Key - overheard plans for a surprise attack on Baltimore. He and the doctor would not be allowed to leave until the attack was over.
 That's how Key ended up witnessing the bombardment of Fort McHenry while aboard a British ship. He couldn't tell from his vantage point who had won or lost. But at dawn, he saw the American flag, 15 stars and 15 stripes at the time, still waving over the fort and was inspired to write a poem. Soon, it was set to the tune of an existing song.
 That's the short version of how "The Star-Spangled Banner" came to be.
 The longer version - of both the song and the story of the man who wrote it - reveals not only why it has become controversial now, in this season of racial reckoning, football and presidential campaigning, but why it was too controversial to become the national anthem for more than a century after it was written.

“We haven’t had much money, but we’ve had a good life and have enjoyed each other,” said Gladys who spoke fondly of their three daughters, Linda, Nancy and Barbara and their 24 offspring.
 The couple moved into a three-room house that they had transported to his family-owned property near Branchville in December 1957. While he was working at the lumber company, he added rooms and a large screened-in front porch where they still enjoy afternoons and evenings sitting in the fresh air, enjoying their peaceful life in the country.
 “We have enjoyed this porch. We’ve had many family dinners out here, and we’ve even slept out here,” Gladys said.

About a month into his first tour of duty in the Navy, Hutchinson resident Ken Bower experienced what he describes as both a living hell and an act of God.
   
 The then-25-year-old was a member of the crew on the USS Cole when it came under terrorist attack Oct. 12, 2000, in a port off Yemen.
   
 As the 20th anniversary of the attack rolled around on Monday, Bower said much of it remains as vivid now as it was on that day and the ones that followed.
   
 But he now relies on his wife, three children and a dog name Keno to get him through.
   
 A graduate of Dodge City High, Bower couldn't wait to join the Navy to see the world. He originally planned on joining the Air Force, Bower said, but a discussion with a cousin in the Air Force instead landed him at sea.
   
 After completing basic and then training at the Navy's gas turbine and electrical technical school in Great Lakes, Ill., his first ship assignment was the Cole, which he boarded from the island of Malta on Sept. 5, 2000.
   
 Fateful morning
   
 The morning of Oct. 12, their ship pulled into the Port at Aden to take on fuel. They'd been doing so for about two hours when a small fishing boat loaded with some 2,000 pounds of explosives pulled up alongside the ship and detonated its cargo in a suicide mission, blowing a 40-foot hole into the side of the destroyer.
   
 The terrorist organization al-Qaeda was blamed for the blast, which killed 17 sailors and seriously injured another 39.
   
 Bower suffered permanent disability from the explosion. The extent of his injuries, however, which included traumatic brain, shoulder and back injuries, weren't clear at the time. He finished his initial four-year enlistment, but has been struggling since.
   
 That October morning, he'd been posted to watch the refueling, to make sure there was no overflow and to signal when to stop. A half-hour into his two- hour watch, Bower said, another sailor was sent up to replace him.
   
 He was angry at his duty officer, GSM I Kathy Lopez, for the switch, since he'd have to take another full two-hour watch later.
   
 He never got an explanation for the move, but he believes it saved his life.
   
 As did circumstances that altered his location on the ship over the next half hour.
   
 "It was a total act of God," Bower said. "It's the only reason I'm here."
   
 While he watched the refueling, Bower said, he was standing near the side of the ship, next to the refueling pipe. The man who replaced him, Petty Officer Raymond Mooney, chose a different location to stand, farther in on the ship and thus further from the eventual blast. He took shrapnel to the face and temporarily lost his sight, but Mooney also survived.
   
 "I was right over the blast zone," Bower said. "I would have been instantly killed."
   
 After being relieved from his post, Bower went to talk to Lopez, who apologized. He doesn't recall exactly why, but he walked off in the middle of their conversation, Bower said, and went to the main deck and then the chow line.
   
 Standing in line, Bower said, he looked down and realized he was still in his overalls, which were speckled with paint. That was unacceptable dress for the chow line and, though the officers who do inspections were not on duty, "a voice in my head," Bower said, "told me to change."
   
 That removed him from the center of the ship, which took the brunt of the blast.
   
 Aftermath
   
 He returned to his berth and was there in mid-dress when the explosion occurred, sending him bouncing off the metal bunks.
   
 "I remember coming to," Bower said. "I don't know how I got dressed. I blacked out again and found myself on the main deck in a daze. It was smoky, pitch dark; the battle lanterns were on."
   
 He next remembers being on the topside weather deck, where he heard what sounded like a shotgun going off and he hit the deck. Bower said that brought him out of his daze and adrenaline kicked in. He then went to the aid of other crewmembers, many of whom had lost limbs and some he watched die, despite best efforts.
   
 "I remember watching an 18-year-old die four times in front of me," Bower said, as three times he was resuscitated by others performing CPR before they gave up. "It was basically the closest thing to being in hell. It was just all screams, and the smell was just horrendous."
   
 Besides the immediate aftermath of the explosion, not knowing who had attacked them, they didn't know who trust. But they had to take the wounded to local hospitals for treatment until military aid could arrive. He recalls going to the hospital to donate blood, being terrified at being exposed, and then shocked by conditions in the hospital.
   
 After returning to the ship, they worked 96 continuous hours, fighting fires, pumping out water and making temporary repairs to the listing vessel to try to save the ship.
   
 "We didn't have any type of U.S. forces for 36 hours," he said. "We were sitting ducks, dead in the water."
   
 "We came close to losing her quite a few times," Bower said of the ship. "I probably could have gotten off because my shoulder and back, but the adrenaline was so intense the only thing you could do was push the pain away."
   
 The temperatures in the region on the unpowered ship - and resulting smells from spoiling food, spilled fuel and the dead - Bower said, were nearly unbearable, and certain smells today trigger memories.
   
 Lingering effects
   
 After three weeks, the ship was able to be towed away and all the sailors were assigned new duty stations, Bower said. He spent the next year on land. When it came time to go back to sea, he struggled.
   
 "Essentially the only thing you're doing on a ship is practice, practice, practice," Bower said.
   
 But those activities stirred memories, and he often found himself unable to properly respond.
   
 "We'd be doing abandoned ship drills … and I'd be an empty shell because I was gone," he said. "When I'd snap out of it, I'd ask what was going on. My shipmates would make fun of me."
   
 He was eventually diagnosed as suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. He finished his four-year duty, but was not allowed to re-enlist despite a desire to do so, Bower said.
   
 ""Things have gotten a lot better," he said. "But I still have issues."
   
 Nightmares interrupt his sleep. He sometimes deals with deep depression. Fireworks make him jump.
   
 He's had two surgeries on his shoulder and needs a full shoulder replacement, but is reluctant to proceed. He's also had ACL surgery, can't stand for long periods because of his knees. Combined with his PTSD, Bower said, he can't find work.
   
 Today, Bower is part of Midwest Battle Buddies, an organization that trains and donates service dogs to other disabled veterans. His dog, Keno, a Siberian husky/malamute, went through the training and is now his key support.
   
 "This dog reads me," Bower said. "He knows if I'm not feeling good or down in the dump and he won't leave me alone."
