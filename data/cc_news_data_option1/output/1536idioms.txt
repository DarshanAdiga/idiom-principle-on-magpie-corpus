After its first decade, the novelty of high definition television (HDTV) faded. The quality of the HDTV picture so far surpasses our former analog system that it dazzles even the most casual observer.


  However, HDTV and subsequently ultra-high definition (UHD), commonly called 4K, and more recently 8K, play fast and loose with qualifying and quantifying resolution.


  To confuse the issue further, all current TVs upconvert lower resolutions to higher resolutions. Thus a 4K TV will use computer circuitry to “improve” HD to pseudo-4K. Many sets do this surprisingly well, but it’s not true 4K.


  The higher the initial resolution, the better the upconversion. Thus, the circuitry in a 4K TV struggles with improving 720p, but excels in upconverting 1080p.


  Broadcast TV, currently 1080i, falls somewhere in between. Some claim there is little difference between 720p and 1080i, but most experts confirm that 1080i delivers a better picture.


  Although a new standard exists for broadcasting 4K, you’ll be waiting awhile to enjoy it.


  You would need to buy an adapter or a new TV, once broadcasters decide to make the investment, which might not happen.


  You also must invest for online 4K. For example, Roku charges $10 extra for its basic 4K Roku stick. If you want to watch 4K Netflix, you must subscribe at $16 a month, verses $13 a month for HD. Netflix’s basic plan at $9 a month doesn’t even stream HD.

The death toll in the U.S. is nearing 40,000 with more than 735,000 confirmed infections, and the global case count has passed 2.3 million, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University of national health reports. The actual extent of the pandemic is likely to be significantly higher due to mild infections that are missed, limited testing, problems counting the dead and some nations' desires to underplay their outbreaks.

OnePlus is ahead of the curve in other ways, though. While Samsung's current OneUI 2.0 and 2.1 are based on old versions of Android 10 that can't even let third-party launchers use gesture navigation, OxygenOS has no such problems. You can expect to get features like those faster and more consistently with OnePlus.

All this means it offers a pretty good picture, and it gets bright enough outside to use it even in bright, sunny direct light. OnePlus also improved the reliability and performance of the automatic brightness setting. I found that to be a problem on the company's last few phones, and it seems to be fixed here. Paired with the new True Tone/Ambient EQ-like "comfort tone" feature, which matches display temperature to ambient light, the display was easy on the eyes. But especially picky people might still spot a few other issues with the screen.

While $900 is competitive in the current market for a 5G Snapdragon 865-powered phone, It's still a _huge_ increase in cost over the $670 OnePlus 7 Pro and $600 7T. Given the crazy prices we are now seeing across the board this generation, I have a feeling that increase may have more to do with Qualcomm than OnePlus, but it doesn't really matter whose fault it is. When you get down to it, this is a really expensive phone — but it's worth every penny.

By and large, OnePlus goes where the smartphone winds are blowing. If notches are in, it does one. If in-display fingerprint sensors are the hot new thing, it'll use one of those.

Some users will also like the iPhone SE's home button. Now that Apple is discontinuing the iPhone 8, the iPhone SE will be the only iPhone Apple will sell with a physical home button. In addition to being intuitive to use, it also means you don't have to use swipe gestures to return to the homescreen or call up recent apps. The home button will also house the device's fingerprint reader for unlocking the phone and authorizing digital payments (what Apple calls Touch ID). The iPhone 11, however, uses facial mapping sensors on the front-facing camera for biometric security (aka: Face ID).
 The devices are both IP certified for water protection. But because the iPhone 11 is rated IP68 compared to the iPhone SE's IP67 rating, it means that the iPhone 11 is a tad more durable against submersion (as in, it's certified to withstand longer or deeper immersion in water). On paper, an IP67 level of certification means the iPhone SE can survive in up to a meter of water (3.3 feet) for about 30 minutes.
 Lastly, the iPhone SE only comes in black, white and red. The iPhone 11 comes in those three colors, too, but if you want more options, you can also get it in pastel yellow, green and purple.

It's tough to talk about battery life objectively with our lifestyles disrupted. We don't go out as much as we used to during the global pandemic, and sitting at home on Wi-Fi isn't going to be indicative of how things will be when (if?) they go back to normal. Still, I can tell you what I got, and it was solid. At the maximum resolution and 120Hz refresh rate, using dark theme in system and most apps, I consistently hit almost seven hours of screen-on time over two days. I consider that solidly two-day battery life and pretty good compared to my experience on other devices, but I'm not sure yet how that might scale with more time spent out and about.

Paul Newton, of Cabarrus County, said in a press release.“People are going stir-crazy with very few live sports underway,” Union County Senator Todd Johnson said. “And allowing NASCAR racing in Charlotte would be a good first step toward returning to some semblance of normalcy. Gov. Cooper should permit fan-less racing.”Sens. Kathy Harrington, Vickie Sawyer and Carl Ford also backed the plan.The Republicans say in order for the track to hold a race, Cooper would need to amend his executive orders.“The lawmakers hope he does so quickly,” the release said.Copyright 2020 WBTV.

The phone is your typical metal and glass sandwich with a 6.55-inch 1080p OLED on the front. There's no notch or pop-up camera, but OP has gotten on the hole-punch train. There's a small hole in the upper left corner where the 16MP front-facing camera sits. The display curves on the left and right edges, but less so than the OnePlus 8 Pro. Unfortunately, I've experienced numerous accidental touches on the edges. I wish everyone would just go back to flat displays. With all the mistakes Samsung made with the S20 series, at least it flattened out its displays. The OP8's bezels are narrow all the way around, and I'm particularly happy that the top and bottom sections are almost perfectly symmetrical (finally).

NEW YORK (AP) — Coronavirus is dealing a gut punch to the illegal drug trade, paralyzing economies, closing borders and severing supply chains in China that traffickers rely on for the chemicals to make such profitable drugs as methamphetamine and fentanyl.
 One of the main suppliers that shut down is in Wuhan, the epicenter of the global outbreak.
 Associated Press interviews with nearly two dozen law enforcement officials and trafficking experts found Mexican and Colombian cartels are still plying their trade as evidenced by recent drug seizures but the lockdowns that have turned cities into ghost towns are disrupting everything from production to transport to sales.
 Along the 2,000-mile U.S.-Mexico border through which the vast majority of illegal drugs cross, the normally bustling vehicle traffic that smugglers use for cover has slowed to a trickle. Bars, nightclubs and motels across the country that are ordinarily fertile marketplaces for drug dealers have shuttered. And prices for drugs in short supply have soared to gouging levels.
 “They are facing a supply problem and a demand problem,” said Alejandro Hope, a security analyst and former official with CISEN, the Mexican intelligence agency. “Once you get them to the market, who are you going to sell to?”
 Virtually every illicit drug has been impacted, with supply chain disruptions at both the wholesale and retail level. Traffickers are stockpiling narcotics and cash along the border, and the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration even reports a decrease in money laundering and online drug sales on the so-called dark web.

Though some clandestine labs that make fentanyl from scratch have popped up sporadically in Mexico, cartels are still very much reliant upon Chinese companies to get the precursor drugs.
 Huge amounts of these mail-order components can be traced to a single, state- subsidized company in Wuhan that shut down after the outbreak earlier this year, said Louise Shelley, director of the Terrorism, Transnational Crime and Corruption Center at George Mason University, which monitors Chinese websites selling fentanyl.
 “The quarantine of Wuhan and all the chaos there definitely affected the fentanyl trade, particularly between China and Mexico,” said Ben Westhoff, author of "Fentanyl, Inc."
 “The main reason China has been the main supplier is the main reason China is the supplier of everything — it does it so cheaply,” Westhoff said. “There was really no cost incentive for the cartels to develop this themselves.”
 But costs have been rising and, as in many legitimate industries, the coronavirus is bringing about changes.
 Advertised prices across China for precursors of fentanyl, methamphetamine and cutting agents have risen between 25% and 400% since late February, said Logan Pauley, an analyst at the Center for Advanced Defense Studies, a Washington- based security research nonprofit. So even as drug precursor plants in China are slowly reopening after the worst of the coronavirus crisis there, some cartels have been taking steps to decrease their reliance on overseas suppliers by enlisting scientists to make their own precursor chemicals.
