Putting you in control of a female bull shark, your diet of the local small fry quickly switches to humans as you’re set loose on the fictional town of Port Clovis located on the Gulf Coast. But just as you’re enjoying feasting on swimmers and smashing up hunting boats, you’re swiftly captured and killed by shark hunter Scaley Pete – imagine Robert Shaw if he had come from French Louisiana. Control then switches to the baby shark that had been inside the mother, which Pete also sadistically leaves a scar on, all which set the wheels in motion for a story of vengeance.

Unlike Gilbert, which is still waiting to see what the Ducey administration might give the town in federal virus-relief funds, Mesa and two other cities and two counties in Arizona got direct federal grants worth millions of dollars because their populations exceed 500,000.
 Although Mesa Public Schools and GPS made lessons on paper available to kids whose households have no internet access or devices, most education experts agree they are a poor substitute for virtual learning.
 In MPS, officials told the Governing Board recently that an estimated 7,000 of the district’s approximate 59,000 students have no devices or internet.
 The city program would be directed at so-called Title 1 elementary schools – those with at least 40 percent of all students living in homes at or below the poverty line.
 High school and junior high school students in both districts have been provided with laptops.
 Distance learning could become a routine part of education in the 2020-21 school year.
 Kathy Hoffman, the state Superintendent of Public Instruction, has promised to issue guidelines by the end of the month for schools to reopen in late summer.
 But superintendents already are worrying about significant numbers of parents who don’t want to send their kids to school out of concerns over the virus. Moreover, a possible resurgence of virus cases could force a statewide school shutdown.
 “I think the new normal will be as early as this fall, our children might not be going back to school in August,’’ Mesa Mayor John Giles said. “I think distance learning will become a bigger and bigger part of the new normal going forward.’’

A D.C. Federal District Judge has set a Feb.13 trial date for the Justice Department's antitrust suit to block the proposed AT&T–T-Mobile merger on antitrust grounds, AT&T confirms.      That came Wednesday in a scheduling conference between Justice and AT&T.      The judge basically split the difference between AT&T's preferred date, Jan. 16, and Justice's choice, March 19.
 AT&T's choice would actually be for the suit not to come to trial but instead for it to work out a path to approval before that. Justice has said it is willing to talk about its competition concerns, and AT&T, which has always said divestitures and conditions were on the table, has said it is willing to listen.

Instead of setting up new companies, in recent years foreign investors have preferred to invest in or buy existing businesses, enabling them to hit the ground running in the lucrative market. There has been a sharp increase in acquisitions this year, especially as cash flows dry up for local businesses amid the pandemic.
 In the first four months of the year, the number of newly-registered FDI projects decreased by nearly 10 percent year-on-year, but the number of companies in which foreign investors acquired shares rose by 33 percent, according to the Ministry of Planning and Investment.
 There were more than 2,600 acquisitions for $1.6 billion without any increase in charter capital and 580 transactions in which the capital increased by $0.9 billion. Japan ranked first with acquisitions of $743 million, followed by South Korea ($356 million) and Singapore ($333 million).
 Ho Chi Minh City-based companies were the biggest targets, accounting for more than half the transactions. Stake acquisitions accounted for nearly 80 percent of the registered FDI in HCMC in the four-month period, Ho Chi Minh City Statistics Office data shows.
 Investors have been especially interested in manufacturing, which saw 822 deals worth more than $1 billion, wholesale, retail and automobile and motorbike servicing, which attracted a total of $500 million.
 Minister of Planning and Investment Nguyen Chi Dung said acquisitions would increase further, with promising businesses snapped up at cheap prices.
 Nguyen Tien Loc, chairman of the Vietnam Chamber of Commerce and Industry (VCCI), also said foreign companies and investment funds are considering acquiring real estate, retail and other companies, many of which are facing difficulties and are even on the verge of bankruptcy.
 Citing this, in a recent meeting he petitioned Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc to temporarily stop acquisitions during the pandemic.
 Do Nhat Hoang, head of the Ministry of Planning and Investment's foreign investment agency, told _VnExpress_ his department had warned about just this two months ago and urged the government to refer to measures taken by other countries to protect domestic enterprises.
 But Vietnam should only restrict the acquisition of major enterprises only, he said.
 Many countries are similarly concerned that foreign investors would take advantage of plunging valuations and problems of businesses to acquire them cheaply.
 Countries such as Italy, Germany, Spain, and India have placed curbs on foreign acquisitions and are even considering buying shares of major and key companies themselves.

It's Sept. 16. do you know where your regulatory fees are?
 The FCC Thursday gave broadcast and cable operators and other licensees until midnight Friday to pay up. The deadline was supposed to be end of day Sept. 14, but the commission on Thursday provided an extra two days.
 By Congressionally mandate, the FCC must collect fees from the licensees it regulates to cover its costs. For 2011, that needs to be $335,794,000. Stations pay on a sliding scale depending on market size, while cable operators pay according to sub count.
 An FCC spokesperson was checking at press time on why the extension was necessary, but the commission is migrating files to a tree-saving, online-only system.

Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic played some of major tennis’ most prolonged rallies during the U.S. Open championship last week, and CBS was all too glad to accommodate. But they have nothing on the game that has been played between the Federal Communications Commission and the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, with media ownership rules as the ball. Rather than appreciating a skillful back and forth, frustrated broadcasters are quite ready for that one to come to an end. So are we.      The Third Circuit has denied broadcasters’ full court appeal of the three- judge decision overturning the FCC’s loosening of the newspaper broadcast cross-ownership rules; this leaves the ball back in the FCC’s court. We disagree with that decision, but it paves the way for the FCC to finally weigh in after years of delay.      The Third Circuit did not tell the FCC it couldn’t revise or even lift the cross-ownership rules, instead saying that the FCC had not given the public enough opportunity to vet the change before it was made. That notation came despite close to 10 years of back and forth with the Third Circuit, and more than a year of hearings, before the FCC’s 2007 decision to loosen— not lift—the ban.      That decision made nobody happy. Media consolidation foes said any change was too much, even though the FCC refused to lift or loosen any multiple-ownership regs, and took affirmative steps to help boost minority ownership participation. Broadcasters were not happy with the light touch as they faced the hefty competition from more lightly regulated opponents, such as cable operators that are free to program to adult audiences without facing the FCC’s indecency police; and the Web, where audiences can go for just about anything.      Both sides sued, so everybody had a hand in keeping the issue in the courts. But the court has ruled once again, and enough is enough.      The FCC should loosen ownership regs on broadcasters— no matter what the Third Circuit had to say—and scrap the ban on cross-ownership. But it may be hard to get the FCC to focus on helping the medium remain competitive when it is currently trying to reduce its footprint and promote broadband as its medium of choice.      If the commission is serious about wanting to leave behind a viable broadcasting service in the wake of the _S.S. Wireless_ , as FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski has continued to profess, it could demonstrate that by “personing” up and getting rid of the cross-ownership regs. The regs are an artifact of another century, a time before cable, satellite and the Web exploded the myth of scarcity and made ludicrous the idea that broadcasters have a corner on viewers or markets—except when the FCC wants to regulate their content, in which case broadcasters are cited as (cue the deep-voice narrator) a uniquely powerful and pervasive voice that must be regulated.      All we needed to know about why the cross-ownership rules are still around we learned from those three former FCC chairs, Democrats and Republicans, who told a C-SPAN audience a while back that they all thought the regs should be scrapped, but did not do so—with knowing smiles all around— due to political pressure from Congress.      The FCC is currently vowing to deliver on a long-overdue quadrennial review of its ownership regs, a congressional mandate that is in legal limbo due to the Third Circuit appeal. We’re not sure how much good loosening the rules will do. How many stations and newspapers are clamoring to get together?      But the FCC is trying to promote more local news coverage in small markets. Broadcasters remain the major source of local news, and small markets are the ones most hurting and in need of the kind of economic support a combined operation could provide. Yet those are the stations the FCC is now barring from such combos, save in dire circumstances where the help may come too late.      One condition in the Comcast/NBCUniversal deal held that stations should get together with hyper- local Web operations to produce better news. Why shouldn’t stations be encouraged to team up with newspapers in small towns to do the same thing? Or does that somehow cross the foul line?      Our big fear is that the FCC will take half-steps again, nobody will be happy again (except the lawyers billing for their time) and this will go back to the courts…again.      This is not a way to run a regulatory regime, but it is a way to run broadcasters ragged and, eventually, into the ground. We hope that is not anyone’s intention.

There looks to be some life in the old medium yet. Even as wireless companies continue to push broadcasting to the boneyard, over-the-air TV was demonstrating that it could still deliver the creative goods, and the audience.      Anybody watching the beginning of last week’s Emmys telecast could be forgiven for thinking they had accidentally tapped into an ABC closedcircuit feed of an in-house company awards dinner, as _Modern Family_ raked in almost all the trophies for comedy.      Then came one of the biggest surprises of the night, when _Friday Night Lights_ took the award for best writing of a drama and Kyle Chandler for best actor, with the show up against the likes of AMC’s _Mad Men_ and HBO’s _Boardwalk Empire_.      Charlie Sheen may have been delivering a big audience for his Comedy Central roast last week, a sort of twilight zone where racist remarks that would wind up on CNN or get radio hosts canned were bantered with relative, and queasy, immunity. But on the same night, the broadcast of the Sheen-less _Two and a Half Men_ was appointment television, drawing an audience almost four times as large, while _Dancing With the Stars_ proved that a transgender individual could dance—OK, only marginally well—without rending the moral fabric of the nation.      CBS’ Leslie Moonves pointed out at a recent Paley Center conference that while people have been trying to bury network television for many years, his network is still making “hundreds and hundreds” of millions of dollars. No, it isn’t doing ESPN numbers, as Moonves was quick to point out, but the sky is not falling. And with an expected 2012 election ad windfall, broadcast TV is still a good business to be in.      And it is a better business with the help of the retrans cash that Moonves staked out early on as a potential game-changer. CBS is making those hundreds of millions, and it is thanks, in part, to the recognition that a dual revenue stream is key to survival in a multiplatform world where everybody else gets paid for their valuable content.      As the next round of must-carry elections and retrans deals starts coming due this fall, look for more tough negotiations. Of course, this does suggest that, despite the hand-wringing in some quarters, broadcasting is still must- have programming.      While the FCC has been asked to get into the middle of those negotiations, so far its response has been appropriately measured—so long as it leaves on the cutting-room floor its suggestion of waiving exclusivity rules for retrans impasses.      Clarifying for everybody what good faith negotiations are—and aren’t—without inserting itself into those understandably contentious deals (they are, after all, between tough businesspeople trying to gain every advantage) is the right way to go.      There is no doubt that broadcasters are, of necessity, having to think of themselves as content companies rather than tying themselves to any one delivery system. Moonves said as much. But as long as broadcasters put on content that people want to watch, and as long as local broadcasting continues to be the go-to medium for emergency information and news—as government agencies continue to pointedly remind us during emergencies—broadcasting should remain profi table and relevant.      After the earthquake and Hurricane Irene, followed by a little tropical storm that caused a thousand-year-event’s worth of flooding along some parts of the East Coast, it is hard to argue against having that broadcast first-informer line of defense, particularly since it will still take years before an interoperable broadband communications network is built on the backs of reclaimed broadcast spectrum. In the meantime, if the cell phone industry gets behind a push to put TV chips in their devices, they, too, could share in the power of broadcasting to help keep their customers entertained, well-informed and safe.

 FRANKFORT - The Frankfort Free Library will have a proposition asking for a slight increase in the tax levy for the library on the ballot for the Frankfort-Schuyler school budget vote and a virtual meeting is scheduled to discuss the proposal with residents.
 The meeting is set for 7 p.m. Wednesday, May 27. Anyone who wants to participate must provide their email address before May 26. They may email the information to Frankfort@MidYork.org, send a message on the library's Facebook page or leave a message on the library's answering machine at 315-894-9611.
 The estimated tax rate increase would be about 4 cents per $1,000 of assessed value, said Melissa Wohler, library director. While the increase would not have a major impact on tax bills, it would allow the library to expand its programs.
 \"We had increased traffic before the shutdown,\" said Wohler, adding that, if approved, the additional funds would be used to increase staffing and add programming.
 The estimated library tax rates for 2020-21 are 0.438639 per $1,000 of assessed value for the property owners in the town of Frankfort and 0.359367 per $1,000 for the town of Schuyler.
 That means the estimated library tax bill for someone in the town of Frankfort with a home valued at $50,000 would be $21.93, up $1.68 from $20.25 for the current year. For someone with a home valued at $100,000, the total would be $43.56, up $3.35 from $40.51 for the current year.
 In the town of Schuyler, the estimated tax bill for the library would be $17.97, up $1.93 from $16.04 for the current year for a house valued at $50,000; and $35.94, up $3.86 from $32.08 for a house valued at $100,000.
 The school budget vote is scheduled for June 9. One ballot is being mailed out to each household in the district. If additional ballots are needed, residents should contact the district clerk at 315-895-7781 or email cgiordano@frankfort-schuyler.org.
 Wohler noted that the project renovating the entryway to the building and installing a lift to the main and lower levels of the library is complete, providing universal access to both levels. The library has applied for a state grant to make improvements to the lower level.
 Like other libraries, the Frankfort Free Library is closed due to the coronavirus pandemic. Wohler said the library is keeping in touch with the Mid-York Library System and will be taking its cue from Mid-York on when and how to reopen. She expects to offer curbside pickup initially. In the meantime, the library has Wi-Fi service available and is encouraging patrons to use the library's digital resources.

The FCC has extended to June 30, 2012, the deadline for cable operators, broadcasters and others to comply with the new Emergency Alert System's (EAS) Common Alerting Protocol (CAP) for receiving those alerts. That came Friday after almost everybody said they needed more time to test and implement the system and even FEMA did not object.
 The National Cable & Telecommunications Association and Verizon were on the same page, as was the National Association of Broadcasters and their opponent on the media ownership issue, Prometheus Radio.
 The FCC had previously waived the March 29, 2011 deadline after industry said it would have been difficult to get the appropriate equipment to receive the alerts.
 NAB had argued that the time for testing was necessary so they did not buy expensive equipment to meet the deadline only to find it did not comply. NCTA said while its operators were working toward CAP compliance, they would be in the midst of a ramp-up of a separate emergency alert test in November (which the FCC has scheduled), and that they were not yet sure whether the alerts were going to be distributed to cable operators via the Internet.
 The American Cable Association, had argued that "failure to grant additional time will result in an unnecessarily rushed, expensive and likely incomplete process that will fail to achieve the objectives of the program." It also asked for a 12-month extension on the eventual deadline for smaller operators -- 1.5 million subs or fewer -- and a blanket exemption for those with fewer than 500 subs.
 "We agree with the majority of commenters that an extension of the current CAP compliance deadline is warranted," the FCC concluded.
 "On behalf of all ACA members, I want to applaud the Federal Communications Commission for postponing until June 30, 2012 the deadline for cable operator compliance with the Emergency Alert System's (EAS) new Common Alert Protocol (CAP) technology, which should provide a window of time for EAS participants to be certain that the actions they take will indeed comply with final CAP requirements," said ACA President Matt Polka.
 The FCC did not address ACA's waiver requests in the order, released Friday.

Amateur baseball in the Twin Cities’ western suburbs is a mixture of optimism and pessimism this week as coaches and players await the next round of state orders from Gov. Tim Walz, who is in charge of which activities can resume in light of the coronavirus pandemic, which was declared in early March.
 The Hamel Hawks, who have fielded a team every year since 1926, are able to practice on their home field, and that’s an advantage they have over their Riverview League rival and 14-time state Class A champion, Minnetonka.
 “No more than 10 people can practice at a time,” manager Tim Flemming of Hamel said. “And we have to enforce social distancing.”
 Social distancing means that players have to stay at least six feet apart. When you have an entire baseball field and only 10 players, that is fairly easy to do.
 Last summer, Hamel made its first trip to the State Tournament since 2000, and most of those players are coming back for the 2020 season, Flemming said.
 “Toward the end of last season, and in the playoffs, we played some pretty good small ball,” Flemming noted.
 The Hawks have their deepest pitching staff in years, and it’s even better this season with the return of Benilde-St. Margaret’s High graduate Derrick Drees.
 Most of the Hawks graduated from area high schools, including Wayzata, Armstrong and Providence Academy. An influx of Wayzata talent the last few seasons has brought in key leaders such as second baseman Bobby Isbell and pitcher Jake Marsh.
 There is never a question about Minnetonka’s talent. The Millers are built around veterans Mike Davis, Donny Erdall, Eric Fasnacht, Ryan Poppitz, Blaine Rutledge, Steve Schmitz and Joe Shallenberger. All of them are candidates to wind up in the State Class A Hall of Fame someday. Shallenberger holds most of the team’s offensive records and has won numerous MVP awards over his previous 18 years in town ball. Pitcher Erdall has more than 1,000 career strikeouts, plus one of the best winning percentages in state Class A history.
 Kevin Hoy, the manager for all 14 of the Millers’ state championships, said the team is anxious to regain the title that it lost to the Minneapolis Cobras last summer.
 “I was really positive for a while,” Hoy said last week. “But there’s a chance we might not have a season. There is so much that is out of our control. We can’t get on a school field or a city field to practice. Veterans Field, Big Willow and Bennett Park are all closed because of the coronavirus. The players want the season to begin, but many of the umpires I’ve talked to say they won’t umpire this summer.”
 The state amateur baseball board is divided on the question of playing this summer. It’s a tough decision, and two board members recently quit.
 Time will tell if Gov. Walz will lift the gates to make local parks available for the amateur ballplayers.

The FCC said, officially, Tuesday that it cannot let LightSquared proceed to use its satellite spectrum for terrestrial broadband without further testing of its potential interference with GPS systems.
 It had already put a hold on that authorization after initial testing found issues with the sensitivity of GPS receivers being interfered with by LightSquared transmissions even though those transmissions were not bleeding into the adjacent GPS band. LightSquared wants to build a wholesale 4G wireless network that could be branded by cable operators and others looking to add mobile service to their bundles.
 In the wake of that testing, LightSquared modified its proposal, saying initially, at least, it would use only the lower 10 MHz part of its band, reduce power and foot the bill for research into better GPS receivers. LightSquared execs say the issue is with the sensitivity of GPS receivers, an issue that industry did not raise until after LightSquared had invested billions based on the FCC conditional authorization. The GPS industry counters that the problem is that there would not have been a receiver problem had LightSquared not sought to use its satellite spectrum for a terrestrial-only service several billion times more powerful than the satellite signal.
 The FCC said Tuesday that testing of LightSquared in the lower band showed "significant improvement" over the upper 10 MHz adjacent to the GPS band, but that "there continue to be interference concerns, e.g., with certain types of high-precision GPS receivers, including devices used in national security and aviation applications. Additional tests are therefore necessary."
 FCC officials had made clear in a briefing with reporters several weeks ago that it would not allow LightSquared to proceed until it was sure the interference issues -- which include navigation, weather monitoring and emergency response -- had been resolved.
 But they also made clear that they wanted to find a solution that would allow LightSquared to create a new national wholesale wireless network as a price and service competitor.
 LightSquared has continued to strike deals, including with Sprint to build the network and most recently this week with VoX Communications, which is looking to add mobile wireless to its VoIP offerings.

"For long the State judiciaries have been under the domineering and strangulating influence of the various State Governors, thus making the Chief Judges of the various States to always be going cap in hand begging State Governors for release of funds due to the Judiciary, which ultimately affect the independence of the judiciary and make the Chief Judges want to be subservient to the State Governors. This sad situation led to the neglect of the State Judiciaries by the various State Governors except for States where the Governors are in good relationship with the State Judiciaries.

Continued fears about global debt markets sent the Dow Jones Industrial Average into a tailspin Thursday, dragging virtually every business sector -- including media -- down for the ride.
 The Dow closed at 10,733.83 Thursday, down 391.01 points, as investors fled from what they perceived to be risky investments to currencies and bonds, according to the _Wall Street Journal_. The resulting sell-off left no sector unscathed.
 Except for Time Warner Cable -- which rose slightly (0.1% or 7 cents per share) -- cable operators took a beating Thursday, led by Comcast, down 3.8% (84 cents) to $21.02 and followed by Charter Communications, down 3.7% ($1.80) to $46.36 and Cablevision Systems, down 3.4% (58 cents) to $16.26.
 Satellite-TV service providers also saw losses for the day, with Dish Network declining 3.3% (87 cents) to $25.40 and DirecTV shedding 1.4% (59 cents) to $41.02
 Programming stocks also took a hit, led by Viacom, down 6.5% ($3.52) to $50.81, after CEO Philippe Dauman warned that the media giant would fall short of double digit ad growth targets in the third quarter.
 The rest of the sector took a pounding, with Disney falling 5.4% ($1.70) to $29.58; News Corp. down 3% (47 cents) to $15.75; Discovery Communications down 3% ($1.19) to $38.74; AMC Networks down 4.1% ($1.47) to $34.01; Scripps Networks down 4% ($1.67) to $40.31; and Time Warner down 3.5% ($1.06) to $28.93.

"En lugar de generar más confusión a los ciudadanos, hay que intentar solucionar este galimatías en el que se ha convertido todo, que parece que hay que ir con un manual de instrucciones para saber cuándo puedes salir y cuándo no", ha censurado Aguado.
 En este sentido, ha indicado que dado que la "pandemia evoluciona a buen ritmo" y las cosas están saliendo "bien", a su juicio es el momento de "adecuar" las restricciones a la realidad de los madrileños, y por ello le piden "comprensión" al Gobierno con la eliminación de estas franjas.
 Preguntado sobre la posibilidad de que el Gobierno abra la puerta a la salida anticipada del estado de alarma a algunas comunidades autónomas, Aguado ha indicado que aunque no conoce "bien" la propuesta -por lo que pide al Gobierno que la explique "bien"- en todo caso aboga por "hacerlo todo de forma coordinada".
 "No tiene sentido poner en marcha mecanismos que, por un lado, te obliguen a permanecer en estado de alarma y, por otro, puedas hacer libremente lo que consideres", ha argumentado.
 En este sentido, ha indicado que a su partido, Ciudadanos, le consta que el Gobierno está trabajando en el "plan B" de cara a la "vigencia del estado de alarma" que acordó con su formación, y ha dicho que "desde luego" el "plan B no puede ser que en unas regiones decaiga y en otras no.

According to the FCC, it sent its network neutrality rules to the Federal Register Friday, Sept. 16. As soon as they are published, opponents of the rules can take them to court. They go into effect 60 days after publication.      Verizon already tried to take them to court, but a judge said it was jumping the gun.      The rules, which expand and codify the FCC's Internet access rules, were approved back in December 2010, but since they required some additional paperwork burdens on industry, they had to be vetted by the Office of Management and Budget, per the Paperwork Reduction Act, to ensure that paperwork was not out of line.      OMB signed off on the information collection portion.      Publication in the Federal Register usually takes a couple of weeks.

September 11, 2001. A day that still lives in infamy. It is not overstating it to say that it was this generation’s Pearl Harbor. And like the living room radios families gathered around back in 1941, the electronic media brought us together, or more accurately, riveted us for days to the unfolding horror and its aftermath, which is still being felt in ongoing overseas wars, the way we travel, and the access we have to our government and its information.      There was some irony in the fact that the 9/11 anniversary has been overshadowed, at least briefly, by the focus on the two latest examples of big breaking news stories that had many media dropping business as usual to take on the role of what the National Association of Broadcasters has come to call “first informers.” Fortunately, neither was of a similar magnitude.      But as we pause to remember those terrible days 10 years ago—can it really be a decade since?—we also pay tribute to those in our own industry family who lost their lives. There was Don DiFranco, a transmitter engineer at WABC New York, who was working on the 110th floor of the World Trade Center North Tower; WPIX engineer Steve Jacobson, who, according to the station, had earlier remained at his post through heavy smoke during the 1993 World Trade Center bombings to make sure that the station got back on the air when power was restored; David Angell, the Emmy awardwinning executive producer of _Frasier_ , who was on one of the ill-fated flights; and so many more.      We also remember those who helped us follow and desperately try to come to grips with what was happening.      Broadcast and cable journalists were everywhere, from the documentary producers plunged into darkness in the basement of the World Trade Center towers as they followed first responders into harm’s way, to President Bush’s plane as it flew the suddenly unfriendly skies rather than risk an immediate return to the nation’s capital.      Those of us who had lived through the aftermath of the JFK assassination could relate to a breaking story that unfolded over days, not hours, and by the sense of being both numbed and disoriented by the unfolding drama yet unable to turn away.      The media have to negotiate something of a minefield with big stories that can draw big audiences, resisting the temptation to over-hype them in the interests of building the brand or keeping the audience, but not underplaying a story that needs to be told or disseminating information that could save lives.      News outlets were catching flak last week for overhyping Hurricane (turned Tropical Storm) Irene. But hindsight is a lot clearer than staring into the eye of a hurricane that forecasters are telling you could be huge, and was huge for many. One _Washington Post_ reader summed it up in a letter to the editor last week. “Amid continued finger-pointing in the aftermath of Hurricane Irene, let’s remember: The only thing predictable about this storm was the post-incident emergence of hypercritical armchair meteorologists with 20/20 hindsight. Faulting the media and the federal government for overplaying events is easy now, but when Irene was pushing north of Florida, it packed winds of 115 mph and its path was unpredictable.”      And broadcasters, in particular, have that “first informer” public interest charter—which means they will likely err toward over-coverage than under. A few stations have been chastised and even fined by the Federal Communications Commission for what the agency saw as not providing sufficiently accessible news and information on storms and natural disasters. So, even if broadcasters didn’t provide coverage out of a sense of commitment to their own communities, which they do, they are expected to do so by the FCC as part of that public interest compact.      We certainly could not blame broadcasters for putting a spotlight on their coverage of the East Coast earthquake and Irene, and their role as emergency communicators. They are fighting for their future in Washington, relying heavily on their value as “first informers” to make the case for leaving them enough spectrum and flexibility to respond to the next crisis.

"Sospetto che le Regioni aggiustino i numeri per paura di essere fermati? No, e non vedo perché dovrebbero farlo. Si tratta di sanità e di persone che muoiono". Lo ha detto stamane Pierpaolo Sileri, viceministro della Salute, a "24Mattino" di Simone Spetia e Maria Latella su Radio 24. "Credo che il calo dei morti sia reale, vedremo se è davvero zero nel secondo controllo con i numeri che provengono anche dai Comuni perché nei gli ospedali non c’è stato nessun decesso. Spero sia confermato zero. In generale i dati di oggi sono più affidabili rispetto a tre mesi fa perché il sistema è ben avviato, si può sempre fare meglio ma credo che i dati sono reali e ben controllati. App Immuni? Sarà disponibile tra 10/15 giorni, per i primi di Giugno. L’app rientra in una riorganizzazione della medicina territoriale e della medicina preventiva, è un tracing importantissimo e quando sarà attivo darà ulteriori informazioni su tracciamento e diffusione della malattia \- ha aggiunto Sileri -. Assistenti civici? Vi sarà un bando, ma sarà tutto chiarito questa settimana. Si è parlato di 60mila, forse ne servirà qualcuno di più perché dobbiamo pensare a questa nuova fase in maniera elastica. Il punto di partenza sono i dati che il ministero fornisce ogni settimana, un monitoraggio attento che rientra nel rischio calcolato e dobbiamo essere pronti a prendere misure di settimana in settimana. Passaporto sanitario per Sicilia e Sardegna? Idea ambiziosa ma impraticabile. E’ necessaria uniformità su tutto il territorio e al momento la vedo molto difficile. Facciamo prima riaprire lasciandoci questo virus alle spalle rispettando le regole".

The FCC said Wednesday that Spectrum Bridge's white spaces TV band database will be the first out of the box to get public testing, a 45-day starting starting Sept.19.
 The FCC last February gave conditional approval to nine different companies (10 when it later added Microsoft) to operate the databases of channels that fixed and portable unlicensed devices can use in the spectrum bands currently used by TV broadcasters. The FCC decided to let "marketplace" forces shape the development of the database service, which will ultimately be overseen by the OET.
 Broadcasters have long been concerned that such devices could interfere with the crystal-clear new DTV and HDTV signals they have staked their future on. Cable operators also have skin in the game since they don't want interference to the signals they get from broadasters, either.
 Why spectrum bridge? "They are the first one ready," said an FCC Office of Engineering & Technology (OET) spokesman.
 "The limited public testing of Spectrum Bridge's database system is intended to allow the public to access and test the system to ensure that it correctly identifies channels that are available for unlicensed TV band devices, properly registers those facilities entitled to protection, and provides protection to authorized services and registered facilities as specified in the rules," said OET Chief Julie Knapp, in a blog posting.
 According to OET, it has "examined Spectrum Bridge's channel availability calculator and finds that it is ready for trial testing by the public." Tire- kickers can get the low down here. The notice did not give the status of the other nine, or when they might get their shot.
 The test is scheduled to end Nov. 2, but the FCC reserves the right to extend it. It also encourages the public, which will certainly include concerned broadcasters, to tell Spectrum Bridge about any inaccuracies or other problems, which the company is expected to address and respond to through the web site.
 Commission rules require an unlicensed TV band device to contact an authorized database for a list of available channels and must confine itself to that frequency. Also registered in the database are cable headend and broadcast auxiliary receive sites and wireless microphones, with the FCC looking to insure interference protections for those as well as TV station primary transmissions.
 The FCC said that it would require that 45-day test period before allowing the database to go live, which means if it passes the test, Spectrum Bridge will be the first out of the box in the marketplace as well. But it will not be in 45 days. The FCC will put out the results of the test for public comment, perhaps in another 45 days or so -- 30 days for comment, 15 for reply -- depending on what the tests find. There are also other benchmarks for approval, including testing with actual devices. The 45-day test is people, rather than devices, querying the database to make sure the channels it says are free actually are. There are currently no devices approved. The databases also have to coordinate with each other, but since Spectrum Bridge is the first, that would not hold up approval, it would simply require it to coordinate, and vice versa, with the next database approved.
 Others with conditional approval are Google, Comsearch, Frequency Finder Inc., KB Enterprises LLC and LS Telcom, Key Bridge Global LLC, Neustar Inc., Telcordia Technologies and WSdb LLC.
