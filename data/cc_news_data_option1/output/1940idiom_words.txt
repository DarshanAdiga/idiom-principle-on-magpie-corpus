As a survivor of leukemia and a bone marrow transplant, I am part of a high- risk population, so my risk calculation is likely different from yours. As my state starts to relax restrictions, I will continue to limit my interactions with others as much as I can. Here are things you can consider.
 ##  What’s associated with a high risk of transmission?
 How SARS-CoV-2 transmits from person to person is still a mystery. It can certainly be transmitted by large respiratory droplets, like those produced when we cough or sneeze. Evidence also suggests that smaller aerosol particles, spread while talking or breathing, can lead to transmission. There is some evidence that people can transmit the virus before they have symptoms, although they will likely have the highest amount of virus close to the start of the illness.
 Taking all this together, it's safe to say the riskiest thing you can do is to come into close contact with sick people. That's why the advice about self- isolation if you feel ill is so important.

Now, as it increasingly appears that the college football season will be played with restrictions — if it is played at all — college administrators and event promoters are busy wondering how games like Alabama-USC pencil out if crowds are prohibited or limited.
 “The math has to work,” said Irwin Kishner, a chairman of the Sports Law Group at Herrick Feinstein. “The site isn’t doing it for free.”
 There are close to 30 games that are scheduled for the regular season for neutral sites, in neither team’s home stadium. Some are seasonal rituals, like when Texas and Oklahoma play at the Cotton Bowl or Southern and Grambling play at the Superdome on the Saturday after Thanksgiving. Other games come without millions in payouts or prime-time TV slots, like when Central Michigan and Western Michigan move their 93-year-old rivalry to Detroit’s Ford Field.
 Several of these games largely cash in on the popularity of college football, particularly in the South. The same day that Alabama and USC are on the calendar, Baylor and Mississippi play at the Houston Texans’ stadium, and West Virginia and Florida State are scheduled at the Atlanta Falcons’ stadium, which is slated to host three college football games in a seven-day span (Auburn vs. North Carolina and Virginia vs. Georgia are the others).
