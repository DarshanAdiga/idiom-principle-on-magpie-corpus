Thus, they provide a unique skill set that makes them stand out from the competition. The firm's team of doctor-lawyers is composed of Dr. Sam Cullan, Dr. Gene Cullan, Dr. Joe Cullan, and Dr. Pat Cullan, all of whom are knowledgeable about the intersection of law and medicine. Furthermore, as a boutique firm, they only accept a small number of cases at a time, giving each client the personalized attention they deserve.

"Everyone was a bit anxious just in terms of our COVID protocols and we wanted to make sure that we were doing everything right and everyone would stay safe and protected and ultimately healthy throughout the beginning of the season and throughout the entire season because COVID isn't going away anytime soon. I think we've done that really effectively," Smith says. "Everyone is taking the protocols quite seriously. It's brought the team together and we're all looking out for each other on that front as well. We've gotten off to a really smooth smart. The season's rolling along now. It's kind of unbelievable to think we've already filmed six or seven episodes in such a short amount of time. We have some momentum now and the protocols are really second nature and we can make our show and present it to our audience. That is such a gift that we're still able to make our show given the circumstances."

 # Deion Sanders lands his best recruit at Jackson State: his son, Shedeur Sanders

 Mississippi Clarion Ledger
 It might have only been a matter of time.
 Deion Sanders landed his best recruit at Jackson State since he was named the program's football coach on Sept. 21, and it just so happens to be Sanders' son.
 Shedeur Sanders flipped his commitment from Florida Atlantic to Jackson State on Friday. Shedeur is a four-star quarterback and the No. 14 pro-style QB in the country for the Class of 2021, according to the 247Sports Composite rankings.
 "I couldn't pass up a opportunity to help level the playing field & pursue equality for HBCu's ! Dad I got your back! JSU #theeilove COMMITTED," Shedeur Sanders wrote on Twitter,
 Sanders currently coaches Shedeur as the offensive coordinator at Trinity Christian School in south Dallas. The Tigers started their season with a 27-26 loss to Mississippi high school Madison-Ridgeland Academy on Aug. 21.
 Going into his senior season, 6-foot-1, 198-pound Shedeur had 8,925 passing yards with 123 touchdowns and 19 interceptions in three seasons as Trinity Christian's starter, according to MaxPreps. He also ran for 225 yards and 11 touchdowns as a junior.
 Per 247Sports, Shedeur is the first four-star commit in Jackson State history. Three-star defensive tackle Braezhon Ross held the designation as the highest- rated commit in program history for a couple of weeks. The three-star from Las Vegas announced his commitment to Jackson State on Oct. 14.
 It didn't take long for Sanders to turn the recruiting game on its head at JSU. Sanders' contract officially begins Dec. 1. The Tigers start an abbreviated spring season at home against Mississippi Valley State on Feb. 27.

Democrats will have to realize that there are certain groups they cannot reach. They need to increase outreach to minority groups. This does not mean that they leave white voters out of the loop. We have a coalition. We also have people who have no problem with authoritarian rule. Like Roxane Gay, I am not sure how you address this problem. Pretending it does not exist is not a solution.

This Steelers defense entered last week's action leading the NFL. While their numbers have dropped off a bit, they remain a top-five unit that can stop the run and the pass. Even after allowing the Ravens to run for 265 yards, they still allow opposing offenses to run for under 100 yards per game on the season.

Turner said he watched the final two innings with his wife Kourtney in a doctor‚Äôs office in the clubhouse and he assumed there was no objection by Dodgers officials to his returning to the field.

Go ahead, tell me "black people were so stupid with lack of priorities that they thought their treatment in the military was as or more important than stopping a butcherous tyrant rampaging Europe" - is that what you always to say? Do you want to say that a cop putting a knee on George Floyd's neck as horrid as that is is as important as a pandemic that's infecting 120,000 a day, killing over 1000 a day and leaving many completely debilitated in a fog - is that your feeling? Is that how all blacks feel? Holding BLM protests in a pandemic that helps escalate street fighting and murders and keep Trump in office is as important as doing what Biden finally learned how to do after 40 years, which is "STFU and stick to your script so they don't sidetrack your only current task, take the White House in November" - is that right?

The Raiders draw another tough matchup when they head to Los Angeles to face the Chargers, with red-hot rookie quarterback Justin Herbert. "Wasn't even projected to be the starter at the beginning of the year," says White. "Their starter Tyrod Taylor had a rib injury in Week 1. Herbert didn't even know he was going to start on gameday, and he did. He's been the starter all season. He is the favorite to win the Offensive Rookie of the Year award, minus $1.80. Joe Burrow for Cincinnati is the second favorite at plus three dollars. Justin Herbert, great job so far. You are the leader in the clubhouse right now."
