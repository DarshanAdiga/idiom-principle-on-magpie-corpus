A US Navy warship has successfully tested a new high-energy laser weapon that can destroy aircraft mid-flight, the Navy's Pacific Fleet has announced. Images and videos provided by the Navy show the amphibious transport dock ship USS Portland executing "the first system-level implementation of a high-energy class solid-state laser" to disable an aerial drone aircraft, the Navy said in a statement on Friday.It did not give a specific location of the laser weapons system demonstrator (LWSD) test, saying only that it occurred in the Pacific on May 16. Navy ships face an increasing number of threats in conducting their missions, including Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, armed small boats, and adversary intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance systems. The US Navy has been developing directed-energy weapons (DEWs), to include lasers, since the 1960s. DEWs are defined as electromagnetic systems capable of converting chemical or electrical energy to radiated energy and focusing it on a target, resulting in physical damage that degrades, neutralises, defeats, or destroys an adversarial capability, the statement said. The Navy's development of DEWs like the LWSD, provide immediate warfighter benefits and provide the commander increased decision space and response options. "By conducting advanced at sea tests against UAVs and small crafts, we will gain valuable information on the capabilities of the Solid State Laser Weapons System Demonstrator against potential threats," Captain Karrey Sanders, commanding officer of Portland, said in the statement."With this new advanced capability, we are redefining war at sea for the Navy." The Navy says lasers, which it calls directed energy weapons (DEW), can be effective defences against drones or armed small boats.

My grandson Luke Zimmerman, Jeff Rice and myself arrived at our cabin at Mill Creek Resort on Lake Texoma an hour or so before dark last week on the eve of a long anticipated top water striper fishing trip with my friends at Striper Express. Bill Carey had been telling me all about the awesome top water action for the past couple weeks and we were chompin at the bit to get after them. There is something very addictive about watching a big striper attack a topwater plug.
   
 Radar indicated a brief but strong front line with lightening was coming through the area sometime during the night and we were hoping it would all be over by first light.
   
 We woke up early to thunder booming and lightening flashing and knew our planned 5:30 departure would be delayed a bit. Lightening sometimes temporarily slows a topwater bite; we remained optimistic that the current early morning pattern would hold. Luckily the front pushed through quickly and by a little after 6, we climbed in guide Chris Carey's roomy guide boat. Radar indicated the leading edge of the storm was skirting around the lake. Bait casting and spinning rods, all carrying the Six Gill Fishing brand logo were rigged with Berkley's new Choppo topwater plugs. I had never fished with these new baits and was anxious to give them a try. Our destination was a distant shoreline where the stripers the previous morning were churning the surface, feeding upon the big schools of spawning shad.
   
 Chris eased the throttle back on the 300 HP engine and stopped a long cast from the bank. We were using 7 foot medium action Six Gill rods and the Deluge bait casting reels. The longer rods made casting the big baits easy and the drill was to throw up as close to the shoreline as possible and 'rip' the topwater Choppo's back across the surface.
   
 Technique and bait presentation is always key to catching fish and Chris instructed us to make long casts and retrieve the big baits with a sweeping motion of the rod, making sure to crank the reel fast to avoid slack in the line because many strikes occur the instant the lure pauses. The reel's fast retrieve was a big help in this type fishing and the smooth drag system proved it's worth.
   
 On Luke's second cast, I heard a splash as a top water feeding striper inhaled the surface plug and then an adrenaline charged "I got him" from my grandson. Luke was using a Banshee series spinning reel and the rod was heavily arched. It was obvious he had hooked a big fish, the reel's smooth drag and steady resistance of the rod soon slowed the stripers long runs and our 'picture fish' for the day was in the boat. This was Luke's biggest striper ever and it was not necessary to coax a smile out of him for the photos!
   
 This relatively new bait by Berkley combines the best of a couple styles of surface plugs. It has the basic design of a standard topwater such as a Pencil Popper or Zara but a little spinner is situated near the tail of the bait. As the bait is ripped along the surface the little 'rudder' shaped spinner moves a lot of water which the stripers had absolutely no problem keying upon, even in the choppy waters.
   
 We all boated several stripers from this first stop and then boats began to pull in and a couple of them got too close to suit our guide. Chris fired up the big engine and headed to another spot that had been producing well. We performed the same drill here, making long casts with the topwaters with the same results, stripers were packed into this spot as well, attracted by the spawning shad.
   
 Knowing current patterns is always key to catching fish, thus the reason many touring pro anglers hire a guide prior to tournament day. A good guide stays on top of the action by fishing every day. We would sometimes drive several miles to fish a particular stretch of shoreline, the reason being that Chris had caught fish there yesterday and knew they were high percentage hotspots. With a top notch guide service such as Striper Express, there are often several guides fishing on a daily basis; they share information and keep their clients in the fish. If for some reason, a pattern that has been as steady as the Polar Star changed overnight, chances are very good the fish will be active in another part of the lake.
   
 After a couple hours of the type of topwater action that keeps anglers awake at night dreaming of, the surface action slowed. It didn't completely stop because there was still a cloud cover but strikes were coming less frequently. We changed the topwater plugs for lead head jigs with Sassy Shad bodies, chartreuse color.
   
 A ten minute boat ride put us in a big shallow bay, the water was only 2 to 3 feet deep. Thanks to a high cliff on the windward side, the surface was much calmer. Again, we were schooled in the preferred technique, the bait presentation that had been working best.
   
 "Make long casts, allow the jigs to make contact with bottom and pump the rod up, which will suspend the bait. says Carey. "Crank fast as your baits begin to fall to keep slack out of your line. This will enable you to feel the strike which often occurs the instant the jig pauses."
   
 Stripers, especially the hefty ones we were catching, usually hit a lure at mock speed. The fishes' intent is to stun and kill the baitfish. We missed a couple of fish because of a little slack in the line as the lure began to fall, a common mistake. But we soon mastered the technique and enjoyed some fast paced catching on a totally different pattern that the way we were fishing during early morning.

BEAUMONT, Texas (AP) — Howard Orphey, 75, is the landlord many might wish they have. Unfortunately for those with two legs and opposable thumbs, he caters solely to two-legged, winged occupants. Martins are his tenants of choice. The migratory birds, which make their way to the region in February, nesting and raising their young before making the trek back to South America in late November, have a friend in Orphey. He has built them nesting houses from scratch and monitors their growing family progress from a camera mounted inside a multi-unit Martin dwelling outside his home on Pipkin Street in Beaumont’s South Park neighborhood. He has been building the birdhouses for three years now, after seeing a martin nest outside the furniture refinishing business owned by Patrick McClure, with whom Orphey has worked for years doing upholstery. “I love birds, and these, they’ve got to have a house,\" Orphey told the Beaumont Enterprise. They don’t just build nests up in trees, so they depend on people.” Before people, the martins would build in existing spaces, like those created by woodpeckers, but given the timber demand and how many trees get cut down, they have become more reliant on people for their nesting spaces, he said. Orphey makes sure they are protected from competition from other nesting birds by checking and removing their nests, noting that many other birds are less comfortable around people interacting with their nesting sites. It is simply another way martins are protected by people. Every day, Orphey watches the birds, watches how the parents feed them, watches as they hatch and grow from the livestream video constantly playing in his house. The eggs typically take two weeks to hatch, and 26 days or so later, the hatchlings are grown and gone. By...

Let me cut to the chase. Suitts is not a fan of school choice, and his disdain for charter schools is rooted in his lifelong advocacy for civil rights. Much of the book is a history lesson on the struggle to overcome segregation, both directly and more implicitly, within the public education system in America. Suitts explains the sociocultural as well as the economic and political conditions that led to the U.S. Supreme Court’s unanimous decision to overturn the “separate but equal” legal doctrine with Brown v. Board of Education in 1954. He then proceeds to take the reader through the next 64 years, showing how segregationists never really abandoned their efforts to return to an era in which advantages are made available to some while being systematically denied to others.
 In essence, Suitts makes a convincing case that the modern school choice movement is, at its core, an attempt to return to de facto segregation. He outlines several parallels between the discriminatory policies and practices of the past and the current administration’s obvious bias when it comes to how we should be educating our youth. In a very detailed and categorical manner, the author illuminates the true motives behind the so-called civil rights policies of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos and the well-connected and equally well-funded lobbyists who are attempting to shape federal, state and local education policy behind the scenes.
 “Overturning Brown” is extensively researched, with 20 pages of source notes at the conclusion of the 14 relatively succinct chapters that form the main narrative. I was also impressed with the numerous historical pictures, maps, charts and other graphics that permeate the manuscript and bring the prose to life in a way that would not have been possible otherwise. It is apparent from the very first page that Suitts has done his homework. Moreover, his literary style is accessible to a general audience and fairly straightforward; he is telling a very important story and he wants the reader to share his enthusiasm for the subject matter.
 The founding director of the Alabama Civil Liberties Union, Suitts began his career as a staff writer for the Selma Project. A longtime adjunct professor at Emory University, he also served as executive director of the Southern Regional Council and as program coordinator, vice president and senior fellow of the Southern Education Foundation. More recently, he served as chief strategist for Better Schools Better Jobs, a Mississippi-based education advocacy program associated with the New Venture Fund. He is perhaps best known as executive producer and a writer for “Will the Circle Be Unbroken,” a 13-hour Peabody-winning public radio series on the history of the Southern civil rights movement. This is his second book, the first being “Hugo Black of Alabama: How His Roots and early Career Shaped the Great Champion of the Constitution,” which was published in 2005.

With the COVID-19 issues, seemingly hundreds more hunters were able to be in the woods each and every day. I’ve never seen hunting pressure anything like this and the harassed and terrified birds shut down.
 Every path, trail, rutted track and dirt road has been traveled multiple times every morning and the turkeys submitted to a veritable barrage of calling. The pressure has been so bad that last week we stopped finding even hen tracks in the mud; at this point in the season they appeared frightened to come near a road.
 Now, I hope many of you located birds in areas where the birds are still gobbling. Even if you don’t bag a turkey, just hearing them in the roost at dawn make getting up worthwhile.
 If a bird could be coaxed in and you had to remember one simple thing to increase your odds of success, what would it be? With conditions so difficult, you may not have other opportunities.
 As I look back over all the years I’ve hunted, one lesson stands out above all others. What has cost me more gobblers than any other error you can make? The answer is movement.
 A turkey can see approximately six times better than you can. I have no trouble seeing a leaf flutter at 100 yards or even farther — a turkey can see the same movement at 600 yards. That’s scary, but one thing I’ve learned is that any movement, no matter how slight, can end your hunt instantly.
 I know that many of you less experienced hunters probably watch TV hunting shows. What those hunters appear to get away with during a gobbler hunt is very misleading. Perhaps they’re hunting large areas of private property, in a blind or natural cover that hides movement, or the birds are used to seeing humans. One sometimes wonders about how the footage of hunts is put together.
 The single exception to the movement rule may be when using a gobbler decoy, and the tom approaching is fixated on the decoy itself and not otherwise paying attention. But, the only bird coming in to a decoy is usually the biggest in the area — all the other birds are afraid of that boss bird and flee at the sight of a decoy, thinking if it’s a hen the boss is just out of sight. A gobbler decoy is mistaken for the man himself.

How much motion does it take to spook a wild, wary, public land gobbler? The “slightest motion” is the answer. If you wiggle your finger at 100 yards a gobbler will see it and vanish. Even trying to shift your point of aim 6 inches, slowly moving your muzzle in any direction, will be spotted instantly within 50 yards and the bird will flush or duck and run.
 I don’t believe most hunters realize how many gobblers they spook that are never seen, that the hunter has no idea the bird was ever there. I remember one hunt when my uncle killed a very nice tom I called in, but never saw. The big gobbler walked past my uncle just out of range, headed directly for me.
 He stopped gobbling when he was close and had taken a long time coming in. My butt was killing me, my back ached and the arm and wrist holding my shotgun up were screaming. Knowing the gobbler was very near I stood the agony for as long as humanly possible keeping my eyes peeled in the direction he last gobbled from. Finally, I had to lower the shotgun a few inches to take the pressure off.
 The gobbler must have had just his head stuck up, unseen by me, and seeing me move just that small amount immediately turned and hurried back the way he came — only this time he was within range of my uncle who dropped him with a load of 5s. Boy, was I glad to hear that gun go off I could move again at last and ease my bodily agonies.
 On another hunt I watched a gobbler walk in front of me just out of range and head directly for my partner, calling to my right about 50 yards away. We’d been sitting there about 40 minutes and by that time body parts start to complain. The gobbler stopped behind a brush pile and stood absolutely still for some 15 minutes. Suddenly, he turned and ran down over the hillside. I stood and walked over to Dan, who looked surprised I was not still sitting.
 When I asked if he had just moved only a minute or two ago he looked surprised, thought, and then replied his elbow had slipped slightly on his knee. When I told him a big gobbler was standing just 35 yards from him behind that fallen tree top, watching him for 15 minutes and seeing that slight wobble, he looked disgusted. He’d seen a flicker of movement there, but didn’t know what it was.
 How many times gobblers come in silently that you never see and stand there looking for long periods of time can only be guessed, but I’m sure it’s much more than we like to admit. To make matters worse, even if you don’t move, the gobbler may leave anyway, since he doesn’t actually see a live hen.
 A lot of small things have to happen correctly before you can shoot a gobbler. Some are out of your control, but if a bird does head in your direction, you have to remember, above all else, not to even twitch and only move your shotgun when the bird is behind cover.
 Otherwise, my friend, the game’s up, you lose!

An online service from Sheba Medical Center will allow certain psychiatric patients to remain at home rather than be hospitalized for their condition, _Israel Hayom_ reported.
 This service is offered through an application, which will allow the medical teams to monitor the 35 people in the program, and marks the first time a replacement service to hospitalization has been made available in Israel.
 The service, granted by Sheba Medical Center, was first made available in November 2019 for members of healthcare providers Maccabi and Meuhedet and is estimated to expand in the wake of the coronavirus crisis.
 The Health Ministry has already approved this service for members of the two medical providers and is meant to be used by people whose medical tests have determined that they must be hospitalized  quickly after their mental state has severely worsened, and is not meant for those who are in forced hospitalization who may serve as a danger to others or themselves.
 Each such patient receives a special kit, which includes a tablet with the app installed on it which allows for uninterrupted communication between the patient and the medical staff which includes psychologists, nutritionists, social workers and others.
 "If this option didn't exist, I would have had to hospitalize myself and I may not even have remained alive" one patient who was eligible for Sheba's program told _Israel Hayom_ , after suffering from a crisis following her diagnosis of a chronic illness.
 "Before the coronavirus crisis, I thought that speaking with a psychiatrist through video chat wouldn't be as effective, but I found you can have a good conversation through the computer, even better than the face to face treatment I had received."
 "The treatment is very comprehensive, feeling as though I always have someone to turn to when I need to. My mental state has very much approved due to the online hospitalization, it pulled me from a dark hole and saved my life, and for that I'm a thankful."

So very few coaches were as aware as Woodring of what it took to achieve success at the highest level. And he saw those qualities in the Hubbers before the 1997 season even began.
 Smethport, after all, was bringing back two-time defending state champion Brandy Colley (3,200 meters) as well as state medalist Stephanie Bango.
 And though the Hubbers went just 5-4 in the regular season and didn’t even win the North Tier League title, coming in second to rival Coudersport, Woodring noted, “dual meets are much different than invitationals. We didn’t have a deep team, but we had a strong team.”
 And those invitationals, where Colley, Bango and the Hubbers’ 3,200-meter relay team shone brightest, earned the Hubbers respect from around the state and validated Woodring’s hope that his team could do something special when it mattered most — first at districts and then at the state meet in Shippensburg.
 “Everything we did during the season in the meets, the invites and practices was all pointed to that one weekend,” he said.
 “We knew we had a good shot of doing well. Were we going to win the state championship? We were going down there with the intention to. I’m not being conceited, but we went down there to get gold medals in all of our events. That’s what we were planning on doing, and if we got enough, we were going to win the state championship. That’s the way they all bought into it and they believed it. It might sound a little foolish, but they believed they had a shot down there to win it all.”
 Years to the date of that state championship and Woodring, Bango and Colley fondly recall their own unique memories from those two days in Shippensburg — May 23 and 24, 1997 — a journey that brought the first team PIAA championship to any McKean County school in over 40 years.
 Colley, a senior who had swept her events a week prior in the District 9 championships, and Bango, one of the district’s top mid-distance runners, were first up in the 3,200-meter relay event with teammates Nicole Windsor and Shannon Murphy.
 After the preliminaries for the individual events were run Friday, that relay was the first event on Saturday’s schedule. With district and state medals already under her belt, Colley was calm heading into the race, using her years of experience as a guide and setting the tone for her teammates.
 “I had been doing it for a long time so I just went into my own mindset and my own little world and tuned everybody out — concentrate on each race and take it one at a time.”
 The first two legs were run by Windsor and Murphy, and interestingly enough, Woodring had planned for the Hubbers to be near last place at the halfway point.

Westgate victim recovering from gunshot wound; friend says "she's a tough girl"
 "I understand you're mad at something in your life, but you have to talk to someone. There are crisis lines for everything," said Jaime. "All I can say is, I'm a person of God. I've forgiven him, but I won't forget."
 Police said, in all, Hernandez Jr. shot three people, but thankfully no one died. Alfredo is now awake and alert after serious surgeries.
 His 16-year-old friend, who was shot in the leg, is recovering in the hospital too. However, Jaime said there's a possibility she loses her leg.
 "It's a tragedy. We didn't expect it to hit home twice," said Jaime.
 The hardest part for Jaime is not being there for her son. She said the hospital's visitor policy won't allow it because of COVID-19.
 "It's really hard when you can't be with your son," said Jaime. "To give him that encouragement and that support."
 Police said Hernandez Jr. surrendered to officers on the scene. He's facing several felony charges and being held on a $1 million cash bail.

The National Association of Broadcasters has told the FCC that it needs to consider changing the UHF discount outside of a proceeding that looks more broadly at the national TV ownership.


  Under FCC chair Mignon Clyburn, the commission proposed to eliminate the discount given that in the digital age UHF stations are now more robust than VHF, a reversal of fortune from the analog days. The UHF discount means that TV station ownership only has to count one-half of the audience reach of those stations toward the 39% national ownership cap.


  In reply comments at the FCC, NAB said that, without regard to what the FCC ultimately decides, it needs that broader look to comply with procedural requirements under the Administrative Procedures Act (9 APA), which is essentially the regulatory agency code of conduct.


  NAB also warned the FCC not to go along with a suggestion by some wireless carriers that removing the UHF discount would be a good tool in prying spectrum from broadcaster hands for the incentive auction.


  The Competitive Carriers Association—essentially the wireless carriers other than Verizon and AT&T—made no bones about why they thought the FCC should jettison the discount. "[The discount] has the potential to discourage robust broadcaster participation in the upcoming 600 MHz incentive auction," they said in their initial comments. "CCA has a keen interest in ensuring that broadcasters are incented to participate in the reverse auction, so that the maximum amount of licensed spectrum is made available for wireless broadband services through the forward auction."


  "The suggestion that this would be a lawful rationale for modifying the UHF discount—or any other FCC rule—should be rejected out of hand. Such an approach would be contrary to the statute authorizing the incentive auction," NAB said.


  NAB argues that if Congress had wanted the FCC to regulate broadcasters off their spectrum, it would have said so.


  "If Congress had intended the Commission to create a regulatory environment inhospitable to broadcasting so as to recruit auction participants," said the trade group, "it would have directed the Commission to do so. Rather, Congress directed the Commission to develop a voluntary auction that preserved the coverage area and population served by each remaining full power and Class A television station."


  NAB also said that approach would be an arbitrary and capricious violation of the APA because it "fails to analyze whether the underlying purposes of the UHF discount and the national ownership cap would be served by changes to these standards."


  Actually, CCA wants the FCC to look at all its broadcast regs with an eye toward incentivizing broadcasters to clear out. It said the FCC should consider "how the existing rules and proposed reforms would affect broadcast stations’ incentives to relinquish spectrum in the upcoming 600 MHz incentive auction and adopt reforms in light of that vital consideration."


  NAB was having none of it. "Congress did not intend that voluntary decision to be influenced by an artificial diminution of the broadcasting business through regulatory changes, and, thus, any FCC rule changes based on such reasons would be arbitrary and capricious," broadcasters said.


  In a blog posting, Rick Kaplan, NAB executive VP of strategic planning and former acting chief of the FCC's Wireless Bureau, called the CCA pitch "desperate, specious and irresponsible."

Havens played at Northeastern State from 1996-98, playing one season each under NSU Hall of Fame coaches Ken Hayes and Larry Gipson. He also spent two years as a graduate assistant under Gipson.


  Havens comes to NSU after spending seven seasons as head coach at East Central University in Ada, Oklahoma. He directed the Tigers to a 131-74 record, highlighted by Great American Conference regular-season titles in 2016 and 2017.


  “NSU is a special place for me, and it’s been a big part of my life and who I am,” Havens said in a release. “I know what it meant for me, and I’m excited to get to sell that to recruits. I’m equally excited about the potential for the program and the impressive changes around campus.


  “We have a plan, we are going to hold people accountable to a higher standard and believe in the process. We will work as hard as possible to find student- athletes who will buy into our program, and I believe that wins are a byproduct of how you operate and what you’re doing every day. We are going to hold true to our high standards and pursue excellence in everything we do on and off the floor.”


  Lincoln has hired Andrea Mize as its women’s basketball coach. She succeeds Ayana McWilliams, who was released after the season.


  Mize has coached Central Florida College for two years, taking over a program that won eight games in 2017-18 and improving it to 12 wins and 19 wins in her two campaigns. Before that she was an assistant at Martin Methodist College for three years and helped the RedHawks reach the NAIA Tournament all three years.


  Mize is a 2015 graduate of Indiana and played basketball for the Hoosiers for three seasons.

Kolkata (West Bengal) [India], May 24 (ANI): West Bengal Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar on Sunday lauded the Army for carrying out post-cyclone relief operations in an "exemplary manner".   He said Army has given a big relief to people affected by extensive damage caused by Cyclone Amphan, which has claimed 86 lives in the state.   "Our Army has in short time performed in an exemplary manner and effected restoration work. A big relief to suffering people. Should have been called @MamataOfficial earliest and not after three days. Army was in full preparedness for relief work even before land fall #Amphan," Dhankhar tweeted while tagging West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee.   The West Bengal Governor also shared videos of Army personnel at work, where they can be seen clearing the roads by removing trees.   The Central Government on Saturday sent five columns of Indian Army to aid the relief efforts.   The Centre took this decision after receiving a request from the West Bengal government.   Earlier today, Dhankhar cornered West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, stating that the Army would have been called three days back to carry out post-cyclone relief work if the TMC supremo had kept the Governor's office in the loop.   Tagging the Chief Minister's official handle on Twitter, Dhankhar said, "Urge Mamata - be in touch with Governor-had this been done army would have been called 3 days back".   The Governor said that he is distressed and pained at the horrifying spectacle of people suffering for lack of basic facilities for several days and appealed people to stay calm.   He further asked the West Bengal government to "share real loss" regarding Cyclone Amphan with the Central government as "inflating figures is counter- productive". (ANI)

The newest names on the granite stones of the Veterans Memorial on the northeast lawn of the Ellis County Courthouse are from 2011. Two graduates of Hays high schools, they were killed in the same helicopter: Bryan J. Nichols and David R. Carter.


   


  "They were pilots in a Chinook when it got blown out of the sky in Afghanistan," explained Stan Dreiling.


   


  Dreiling and Virgil Weigel on Friday were not even half finished with their volunteer work at the monument placing one flag for each Ellis County resident who died serving in the military.


   


  Carter was a graduate of Hays High School, said Dreiling, while Nichols graduated from Thomas More Prep.


   


  As part of their annual Memorial Day routine, Dreiling and his fellow Vietnam veteran Weigel on Thursday placed more than 1,200 flags on the graves of veterans buried at the Mount Allen and St. Joseph cemeteries for Memorial Day.


   


  Dreiling mentioned Friday he's among the last of the veterans who launched the courthouse memorial back in 1988.


   


  "Membership is going downhill at the VFW," Dreiling said of Hays VFW Post 9076. "We've had a lot of funerals since 1972, that I've had the honor of attending along with my other comrades. It's quite an honor; I'm glad we're able to do it."


   


  The VFW averages between 40 and 50 veterans funerals a year now, Dreiling said, adding that of the World War II vets, there are fewer than 20 left in Ellis County, the most recent to go was Calvin Harbin.


   


  "We lost Col. Harbin two weeks ago, he was 104, he's Sheriff (Ed) Harbin's dad," Dreiling said. "That's the greatest generation; boy that's the truth, bar none. They're war heroes."


   


  Dreiling was in the 326th Engineer battalion, 101st Airborne Division.


   


  As for Weigel, "I never went overseas. I just stayed stateside," Weigel said. "Army. I was in communications. Fort Bragg, North Carolina, '60 to '62."


   


  When it comes to membership and community service, Dreiling says the Hays post can't be beat.


   


  "In these small towns, we really take care of our veterans," Dreiling said. "The VFW Post here in Hays, Kansas, is probably the best one in the state."


   


  Hays has a Vietnam Veterans organization as well.


   


  "That's unusual too," Dreiling said. "We've been blessed."

10] In the book of _Daniel_ , Daniel recounts that after King Nebuchadnezzar had died, his grandson Belshazzar was king over the province of Babylon. Babylon was a fortified city and the Medes and Persians encamped around its walls seeking to conquer Babylon. The king was sure that Babylon, due to its massive walls and gates, could not be conquered. In light of this confidence, he had a feast with thousands of his lords and concubines. He then sent for the sacred vessels of gold and silver which his father Nebuchadnezzar had taken from the temple of the true and living God in Jerusalem and when they were brought, he along with his wives and concubines drank wine from them and so defiled the vessels. In that same hour the fingers of a man's hand appeared and wrote opposite the lamp stand on the plaster of the wall on the king's palace the following words, "MENE MENE TENKEL UPHARSIN".

A US Navy warship has successfully tested a new high-energy laser weapon that can destroy aircraft mid-flight, the Navy's Pacific Fleet has announced. Images and videos provided by the Navy show the amphibious transport dock ship USS Portland executing "the first system-level implementation of a high-energy class solid-state laser" to disable an aerial drone aircraft, the Navy said in a statement on Friday.


  It did not give a specific location of the laser weapons system demonstrator (LWSD) test, saying only that it occurred in the Pacific on May 16.


  Navy ships face an increasing number of threats in conducting their missions, including Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, armed small boats, and adversary intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance systems.


  The US Navy has been developing directed-energy weapons (DEWs), to include lasers, since the 1960s.


  DEWs are defined as electromagnetic systems capable of converting chemical or electrical energy to radiated energy and focusing it on a target, resulting in physical damage that degrades, neutralises, defeats, or destroys an adversarial capability, the statement said.


  The Navy's development of DEWs like the LWSD, provide immediate warfighter benefits and provide the commander increased decision space and response options.


  "By conducting advanced at sea tests against UAVs and small crafts, we will gain valuable information on the capabilities of the Solid State Laser Weapons System Demonstrator against potential threats," Captain Karrey Sanders, commanding officer of Portland, said in the statement.


  "With this new advanced capability, we are redefining war at sea for the Navy." The Navy says lasers, which it calls directed energy weapons (DEW), can be effective defences against drones or armed small boats.

The majority of primetime viewers in the key 18-49 demo (64%) are cord lovers, not cutters, according to a just-released Ipsos MediaCT poll.


  That means they have kept the same level of cable or satellite service or added to it in the past six months.


  But 27% were cord shavers, who had indeed cut back. Another 2% had cancelled service in the past six months, while 7% did not have service.


  The study found that most cord shavers were not doing so in favor of more streaming, but for economic reasons, since they were the group most likely to have also cut back on paid online services in the past six months.


  "Results from the study indicate that those who have cut back on the level of TV subscription services in the past six months were also the most likely group to have cut back on paid online streaming service within the last six months," Ipsos said. "This indicates that this behavior may be a part of a broader effort on behalf of this group to decrease their financial spending on entertainment across the board."


  Gavin Bridge, director of media insights for Ipsos MediaCT, said he expected cable operators to offer more a la carte of lower-priced packages to win over the shavers and nonadopters.


  The study was conducted Oct. 21-27, 2013, based on a national online sample of 2,015 adults aged 18-49 who watch primetime TV at least twice a week and are not associated with any related industries.

No fans allowed, no saliva on the ball and hand sanitisers on the boundary ropes. Welcome to cricket during coronavirus as it's being played out in the Caribbean this week. Six teams are taking part in the Vincy T10 Premier League at the picturesque Arnos Vale venue near Kingstown, the main city on St Vincent. Although very low key in the global affairs of international cricket, it's the first tournament to be staged in a Test-playing region since the advent of the coronavirus pandemic.


  At first it was hoped that spectators would be allowed to attend as the risk of infection was considered to be extremely low in a country with just 18 recorded cases.


  "The St Vincent and Grenadines Cricket Association (SVGCA) would have preferred an option of a limited number of spectators, maybe 300 or 500 max in the stadium," admitted SVGCA president Kishore Shallow.


  "However, the experts expressed some initial concerns and advised that we attempt to regularise the management of players before we consider having spectators."


  Local fans had hoped to see home star Sunil Ambris, one of six so-called "marquee players" in the tournament which runs until May 31.


  "Yes, I could understand the frustration, but similarly, I appreciate the preference of (the health authority) that they do not want to encourage social gatherings," added Shallow.


  "At the end of the day, our safety and wellbeing are of paramount importance."


  Ambris must be thinking he is cursed in his career.


  When he made his Test debut for the West Indies in a series in New Zealand in 2017, he became the first player in the long history of the game to be dismissed 'hit wicket' in two consecutive innings.


  On Friday, playing for the Salt Pond Breakers, at least the 27-year-old had the satisfaction of claiming two wickets in a three-wicket win against Grenadines Divers.


  The performance of the day, however, was by Desron Maloney whose 19-ball 41 helped La Soufriere Hikers to a nine-wicket win over Botanical Garden Rangers.


  The tournament is also the first to take place with bowlers banned from applying saliva to the ball, a long-standing tool in helping achieve swing.


  The game's rulers are outlawing the practice as part of the battle against the spread of coronavirus.


  Other safety measures see hand sanitisers situated on the boundary as well as temperature checks. Umpires are wearing face masks.


  The cricinfo website reported that the fall of wickets was greeted by the shaking of legs and punching of the ground rather than a series of high fives.

As restaurants continue to operate by providing take-out, curbside and delivery during the COVID-19 pandemic, more are turning to third-party delivery apps like DoorDash and Grubhub to help people get their orders without having to hire a full delivery fleet themselves.
 But several viral social media posts, including one from Frederick restaurant Cafe Bueno, have had people questioning whether these services help or hinder local restaurants. Often, these apps take a large percentage of restaurant’s profits — up to 30 percent, according to an article by Today.
 When a restaurant partners with an application like Grubhub, it can choose what kind of services they’d like to use. Some restaurants use these apps so they don’t have to build their own online ordering service, but don’t actually utilize the delivery services.
 Cafe Bueno utilized Grubhub in that way many years ago, but canceled the service because there were many errors and the 10 percent commission on pick- up orders was too steep, co-owner Heather Goddard said.
 Once the coronavirus pandemic began, however, she noticed the restaurant was getting a lot of orders from Grubhub. Their menu had been uploaded back to the website without the restaurant’s knowledge or permission.
 But with 16 orders in a single afternoon, it was business Goddard couldn’t turn away.
 “I'm not in a position to refuse those orders,” she said.
 The restaurant decided to keep its menu on the app.
 Goddard sees the need for delivery right now, since many people cannot leave their houses to get food. She herself, as a busy working mother, has turned to services like DoorDash before to get her meals.
 But she was troubled by the way Grubhub interacts with restaurants where there isn't a partnership. When somebody places an order for Cafe Bueno through Grubhub, the order doesn’t go to the restaurant. It goes to a Grubhub driver, who calls the restaurant or comes in to order, and then pays for the order with a Grubhub credit card.
 Because Cafe Bueno did not actually put its own menu on the app, it doesn’t have many of the customizations and options that are available on each menu item. These include if tacos are Mexican or American style, for example. So when a Grubhub driver comes to order, they’re often missing several details.
 The drivers themselves don’t know the details, since they’re reading off of the online order.
 “And we insist now, you have to call your customer and get this right,” Goddard said. “So we'll go through each menu item, this is what you need to ask about this, this is what you need to ask about that. Come back when you have the correct order.”
 But if Goddard wants to change the Grubhub menu, she would have to partner with the app again, and pay up to 30 percent of each order to the app for delivery. She’s not sure it’s worth it.
 Pumpernickel + Rye, a deli in Urbana that opened in November, decided to enroll with Grubhub and DoorDash once the pandemic began, said co-owner Amy Nesbit. The apps help deliver further than their in-house service, which her husband runs.
 And as a new business, it’s important to her to get their name out there and reach as many people as possible.
 But with such high fees, she said it’s hard to even turn a profit on the orders made through third-party delivery apps.
 “So yes, it does help us that way, it gets us out of the neighborhood,” Nesbit said. “But I can't stress enough, they take all of our profit. We break even on everything that goes into their bag.”
 For Shayne McIntyre, general manager of Chap’s Pit Beef, the lack of control over the orders is frustrating. He appreciates the interface and how easy it is to order, but doesn’t like seeing food that’s ready to go sit and wait for a delivery driver.
 “The vast majority of the drivers are fantastic, they're polite, they come really quickly, they're prompt,” McIntyre said. “… Unfortunately, there are some times where either there's a lot of deliveries going out or there's just not a lot of drivers available, and so the food has to sit for 10, 15 minutes which is just unfortunate.”

 That is $28,155,700 more than was bid in round 4.
 So far, the highest bid by a long shot is for New York City, the nation's largest market, at $93,511,000, followed by number two Chicago at $16,686,000, then Washington/Baltimore at $10,774,000, followed by Philadelphia/Atlantic City at $9,306,000 and Boston at $9,027,000.
 The auction is in its second day, and at this rate has a few more days to go.
 The H block spectrum auction is the first of three congressionally mandated auctions to free spectrum for wireless broadband and pay for FirstNet, the interoperable first responder communications network that was proposed after 911 but has yet to be built out.
 The more money the FCC raises in this auction, the less pressure there is on the other auctions, the last which is the broadcast incentive auction scheduled for mid-2015.

Station groups have been bulking up big-time since last year’s NATPE show, which means that those groups now have more leverage over what shows get produced and how they are distributed. Consolidation, however, can cut both ways.

Station consolidation has now put the shoe on the other foot.…

Authorities in Assam's Kaziranga National Park have found the carcass of a semi-adult male, taking the number of tiger deaths in the park to four this year.


  P Sivakumar, director of the park, said the carcass of the two-year-old tiger was found in the Burapahar range of the 430 sq km park, the biggest habitat of one-horned rhinos in the world.


  "The carcass was found on Friday. It bore several injury marks and the skull was almost crushed. Investigation suggests that it had died due to infighting with other male tigers the previous day," he said.


  This is the second such death reported this month and the fourth one this year. All cases are the outcome of infighting.


   


   


  On May 10, the carcass of a semi-adult tigress was found in the Bagori range and in April an adult tiger was found dead in the Kohora range. In January, the carcass of a three-month-old tiger was found.


  Kaziranga was declared a tiger reserve in 2006 and with 121 Royal Bengal Tigers, it has one of the highest density of the species in the world.


  "In Kaziranga, tiger deaths are mostly due to infighting and not old age. In a year, the average number of such deaths is nearly 10. In other parks, prey base is low, the number of tigers is also low and the area is much larger. So they don't have many instances of infighting," said Sivakumar.


  In the latest instance, forest officials have also detected cannibalism with parts of the dead tiger's body consumed by other tigers.


  "The skull was broken and face disfigured. It appears the attacker, a fully grown adult aged around 10-12 years, might have crushed it. The semi-adult tiger was not able to survive the attack. In this case, we also noticed cannibalism," said Sivakumar.


  Though it is peak tourist season, all national parks, wildlife sanctuaries and zoos in Assam have been closed since March 16 as a precautionary measure against the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).

Per finanziare due nuove tranche di aiuti a circa 470 mila professionisti il fondo da 650 milioni stanziato dal governo non sara sufficiente. Ma la platea di beneficiari con la norma fissata nel decreto Rilancio e previsto che si restringa leggermente. «Si introducono - spiega infatti la relazione tecnica - due ulteriori requisiti per accedere all'indennita»: alla data di presentazione della domanda sara necessario infatti non essere titolari di contratto di lavoro subordinato a tempo indeterminato e di pensione. Per avere diritto al bonus, come gia previsto per la prima rata, bisognera inoltre avere un reddito inferiore a 35 mila euro, oppure collocarsi nella fascia fra 35 mila e 50 mila ed aver avuto un calo del fatturato del 33% nel primo trimestre dell'anno. Sopra questa soglia il sussidio non e previsto. In ogni caso, continua la relazione, «sulla base del numero di domande pervenute agli enti per l'indennita relativa al mese di marzo, tale rifinanziamento e da ritenersi congruo ai fini della copertura finanziaria della misura per le mensilita di aprile e maggio». Sara comunque il provvedimento in arrivo dal ministero del Lavoro a prevedere «ulteriori criteri di selettivita della misura» e «le modalita di attribuzione dell'indennita».

Katherine Nicolini MUNSTER, IN - Katherine Nicolini, nee Vlahos, age 98, was born on July 15, 1921 in Indiana Harbor. She passed away peacefully at home after a long illness on April 29, 2020. She is survived by her devoted daughter Kathleen Nicolini. She was preceded in death by her husband John Nicolini, who was the love of her life, her beloved parents Panayiota and Nicholas Vlahos, her brothers Louis Shepherd, Deno Vlahos, James Vlahos and her sister Rose Vlahos. She was also preceded in death by Helen Karmangianis Bernardi, with whom she was best friends since the age of four. "Auntie Kay" is survived by Helen's girls, Joanne Bernardi, Cynthia Bernardi and Maria Bernardi and Helen's adored grandchild Alexandra Roeser (John). Father Constantine Aliferakis conducted a funeral liturgy on May 5, 2020 at St. George Greek Orthodox Church I Schererville Indiana followed by interment at Ridgelawn Cemetery. In this era of the pandemic, there was no wake or memorial dinner. The remembrances of Katherine by all of her family and friends were unable to be shared. Here are a few sweet memories of Katherine "Kay" Nicolini. She grew up in the tight knit Greek Community of Indiana Harbor. Her father Nicholas was on the first church board of St. George. My mother remembered going to the first liturgy. She has new shoes… black patent Mary Janes. She and her brothers were active in Church. She attended the Plato Greek School, acted in Greek language plays and recited Greek poems on Greek Independence Day, She attended Washington High School with her brother Jimmy and was featured in many revues, The first song she ever sang in public was "Deep Purple". After high school she also sang with a Big Band, chaperoned by her brothers, of course. To the shock of some Greeks, she married my Italian father, John Nicolini in 1944. She joined my father in San Diego where he was in the U.S. Marine Corps. While she was there, she worked in the defense industry. When my father shipped out for Iwo Jima, she returned to Indiana Harbor to await his return. Throughout her life she was active in the Greek Community. Here is what her church had to say about her. Kay was a founding member of our church, and was currently the oldest living member of our parish. She was heavily involved in our community and its organizations. She was an active member of The Ladies Philoptochos Society and Daughters of Penelope. In her later years, as most would be slowing down, she became a member of the St. George Parish Council, serving as our first female Parish Council President. Her commitment to our community was unparalleled. She served on too many committees to mention and always looked for the betterment of her beloved St. George. She single handedly raised over $800,000 over the years for Greekfest sponsorships. She greeted parishioners warmly every Sunday and welcomed all our guests with open arms. To our youth, she was "Yia Yia" Nicolini, the nice lady that greeted them at the door on their way to Sunday School. Whether you knew her for a lifetime or just met her, you admired her kindness and her incredible sense of style. She joins her beloved husband John and her parents, brothers and sister in heaven. Our deepest sympathies to her daughter, Kathy. We will miss you Kay! Thank you for making our community a better place. May your memory be eternal. Mom, I will love you forever.

NEW YORK (AP) — Claims promoted by the Trump administration that the global coronavirus pandemic originated at the Wuhan Institute of Virology in the central Chinese city are a “pure fabrication,\" the institute's director said. Wang Yanyi was quoted by state media Sunday as saying the institute did not have “any knowledge before that nor had we ever met, researched or kept the virus … We didn’t even know about the existence of the virus, so how could it be leaked from our lab when we didn’t have it?” President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have repeatedly said they suspect the virus that was first detected in Wuhan was somehow released from the laboratory. Most scientists say the pathogen that has infected 5.3 million and killed more than 342,000, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University, was passed from bats to humans via an intermediary species likely sold at a wet market in Wuhan late last year. The virus' toll continued to ebb in Asia and other parts of the world, with China on Sunday reporting three new confirmed cases and just 79 people remaining in treatment for COVID-19. The New York Times devoted Sunday’s entire front page to a long list of names of people who have died in the pandemic. The names and brief descriptions culled from obituaries from around the country fill six columns under the headline “U.S. Deaths Near 100,000, an Incalculable Loss.\" “They Were Not Simply Names on a List.

Complete Coverage: NATPE 2014


  NATPE 2015 will be held a week earlier next January. The show, which will again take place at the Fontainebleau and Eden Roc Resorts in Miami Beach, will kick off on Jan. 20, 2015, the day after Martin Luther King, Jr., Day, and run through Thursday, Jan. 22, 2015, said Rod Perth, NATPE CEO, in a press conference on Wednesday.


  That scheduling change, which moves the show up a week, is designed to get NATPE away from Realscreen in Washington, D.C., which has become an increasingly popular event. As a result of that move, “we expect significant growth next year,” said Perth.


  The 51st annual NATPE convention was again a lively meeting of programming executives across the content spectrum, including traditional media companies such as Warner Bros., CBS Television Distribution, Debmar-Mercury, NBCUniversal, Twentieth Television, MGM, Endemol USA and so forth, but also including many digital players – such as Netflix, Amazon and Hulu – and brands, such as Chipotle, Unilever and Subway. The number of buyers attending the show was up by double-digits, said Perth, with attendees averaging about 5,000.


  “NATPE is increasingly the place where people come together, form relationships and try to figure out where the business is going,” said Jordan Levin, chairman of NATPE’s board and president of Alloy Digital. “We recognized that the syndication marketplace, through consolidation and other factors, had become less dynamic and that most deals were done before NATPE even took place. We also recognized that businesses that are dependent upon content are becoming much less cyclically driven. The net result of that is that you start to shift an emphasis away from transactional business and instead facilitate bringing together the right people to have the right conversations."


  “What’s important about NATPE is not the announcements but which business deals people can reflect back on and say those conversations started at NATPE.”


  This year’s events didn’t feature much major breaking news, but there were plenty of parties—with Debmar-Mercury, Twentieth, NBC, Endemol USA, Telemundo, MediaLink and others—all holding events, and panels were often full. NATPE’s next event, NATPE Europe, will take place in Prague from June 23 to June 26.


  Perth also said that Andy Kaplan, Sony Pictures Television’s president of worldwide networks, will be NATPE’s new vice chair. Kaplan will serve side by side with Levin, who will remain in that seat for at least another year.

A lot of what makes _Billions_ so interesting are the circumstances and the context. The idea of Chuck plotting against Axe is not surprising -- we've seen this happen from the very start of the show. Yet, how does it happen now? How much does the past factor into the present? The story with Wendy and Taylor does have at least somewhat of a new sheen on it -- these two could be formidable together, but they _also_ have to get on the same page and that's difficult since they've been long driven by individual priorities.

I was riding home with my dad from a summer league basketball game I had coached, and I know the exact spot on Pennsylvania Blvd. in Monessen when the call came in.


  “Jimmy’s gone,” I told my dad, sensing what Robert was about to tell me.


  When I answered, Robert was fighting through his emotions as he simply said two words, the same two words I had just said to my dad.


  “Jimmy’s gone.”


  The Jimmy he was referring to was Jim Fawcett, known in the Pittsburgh wrestling scene as Devil Bhudakahn.


  Jimmy was found dead at his house after committing suicide, and his death rocked our wrestling community.


  If you were Jimmy’s friend, he would do anything for you, and his viewing was a who’s who in the Pittsburgh wrestling scene.


  We all grieved in different ways and each of us could share stories about Jimmy for hours.


  Robert’s grieving was a multi-step process and he was eventually diagnosed with PTSD.


  As a way to continue his healing process, Piskor has written a memoir titled “Devil Bhudakahn — The Man Behind the Mask.”


  The piece is through the eyes of Piskor, but he also invited several people to share our memories and share how his death affected us.


  “I needed to do this to help me heal mentally and I did not hold back as Jimmy’s death affected me mentally,” he said. “I lost myself.


  “And I lost my passion for trying to make it to the top level.”


  Aside from being excellent in the ring as a wrestler, Piskor is also one of the top referees on the East Coast, using the name Bobby Williams, and at that time, he was performing in England where he was being scouted by Impact Wrestling.


  However, Piskor had a complete mental breakdown while still grieving Jimmy’s death.


  As he moved forward, Piskor learned to speak with others, and he discussed the important role that his wife, Natalie, played.


  “A few years after Jimmy’s passing, I met my wife and she helped me over the years by giving me the motivation to talk about Jimmy’s death as well as the issues I went through over it,” he said.


  Piskor also shared who he wrote the piece for.


  “Jimmy’s three daughters did not get the chance to know him like we knew him as he was a pioneer in Pittsburgh wrestling history,” he said. “I want them to know what kind of man he was.”


  Fawcett’s role in establishing the importance of the Lucha Libre style in Pittsburgh is known well by those inside the business.


  “He helped revolutionized the Pittsburgh scene when he debuted,” Piskor said of Fawcett who briefly wrestled under the moniker Vince Viper when he first debuted. “At the time, pro wrestling was a big guy sport and Jimmy opened the doors for smaller people to live out their dreams.”


  One of those people was Piskor.


  “We met at a picnic for my mother’s employer,” he said of his first encounter with Facwett on May 23, 1999. “A small card was performed and after it was over, I introduced myself to Jimmy.

1924 ~ 2020   Howard C. Nielson died of natural causes on Wednesday morning, May 20. He was living in South Carolina with his daughter Mary Lee Jackson, who was holding his hand when he passed away peacefully, to be reunited with his childhood sweetheart and wife, Julia (Julie) Adams Nielson, who passed away 17 years earlier. Howard was also preceded in death by his second wife, Donna Brown Nielson, who died in 2015. A teacher, public servant, consultant, numbers whiz, friend and neighbor, Howard was known and loved by more than any of us could ever count.   Howard met Julie, his future wife when they were both in elementary school in Richfield, Utah. They spent a great deal of time together until her family moved. Howard and Julie met again briefly in Fresno, California just before he shipped out to the Pacific theater. Building on their storybook friendship, the two were married a little less than three years after the war ended. Together, Howard and Julie raised four daughters and three sons. Ultimately, they would have 39 grandchildren. Their posterity now numbers more than 120.   To his friends and family in Richfield, to his colleagues in Provo, and to his political collaborators in our Utah and U.S. Capitols, Howard was known as a gentleman, as a friend and mentor, as a statesman, and as one of the good guys. As a young man, Howard was a hard-working Richfield, Utah farm boy, a standout high school debater, and the walk-on winner of the 64-dollar question on "Take It or Leave It." He is a veteran of World-War II and the holder of four university degrees. Howard founded the BYU Statistics Department and was a perennial favorite of students there for 25 years. During this time, he spent a year in Amman as economic advisor to the Kingdom of Jordan, and for two years he was Utah's Associate Commissioner of Higher Education. Howard's 20-year tenure as a lawmaker included service as Utah Speaker of the House and four terms In the U.S. Congress. To cap it off, Howard won election and served a four-year Utah Senate term.   It was eight years into his service in Washington, as Howard was moving up the ranks in his party and the Energy and Commerce Committee, that he announced his retirement. He and Julie went on a mission for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Due to the war, Howard had not been a missionary as a young man, but he had promised Julie they'd go together one day. They ended up serving two missions.   Howard always read the newspaper, perhaps as much for the crossword puzzle as for the knowledge of national and world events. Knowing what was happening in the world was one-way Howard perfected the art of being the best prepared for any meeting he entered. Adding to this preparation, he was the original fact- checker. As such, in his first congressional primary election, he positioned colleagues around the state to feed him data, and he kept his own tally of election returns. Howard's count was so much more complete than what the media had, they started reporting his numbers. Howard also loved to see firsthand the places he read about. From road trips across the country to congressional fact-finding missions, from political national committee meetings to Caribbean cruises with family, and from professional assignments overseas to missions in Australia and then Hungary, Howard relished the cultures he encountered. And he treated everyone-from remote island residents to heads of state-with the same respect and kindness.   Despite everything going on in Howard's professional life, he always took time for family and friends. He loved working, playing games, and learning about people. A Richfield acquaintance told of Howard, upon returning to Richfield after his military service, going out of his way and crossing the street to greet her and ask about her family. A former campaign manager told how, at the end of the day, he left a stack of dozens of campaign letters for Howard to sign personally before they were to be mailed. When the manager returned in the morning, the letters had all been signed, and each had a hand-written personal note about something going on in the life of the recipient. "I hope your daughter is doing well at Utah State. She is such a charming young woman." That sort of thing. Connecting on a personal level like this was Howard's way; everyone was important to him.   Howard was preceded in death by wife Julie and his parents, Tayler and Zula Nielson, of Richfield, and by all of his siblings, Ross Nielson, Edith Tuft, Alta Hunt, Ruth Harvey, and Joseph Nielson. He is survived by his seven children, Noreen Astin (Steve), Elaine Taylor (Stan), John (Louise), Mary Lee Jackson (Paul), Jim (Marilyn), Jean Cundick (Clay), and Howard, Jr. (Mariko).   Family members will hold a private graveside service in Richfield where Howard's body will be interred. They will hold a larger memorial service when such gatherings are advisable. In lieu of flowers or other remembrances, his family encourages you to join them in celebrating Howard's life in the small ways his time on earth embodied: find someone to reach out to help, seek a way to serve in the community, or take a minute to learn something about another's life. That is what would have meant the most to him.   Arrangements entrusted to Walker Sanderson Funeral Home. Condolences may be offered to the family at www.walkersanderson.com

Katherine Nicolini MUNSTER, IN - Katherine Nicolini, nee Vlahos, age 98, was born on July 15, 1921 in Indiana Harbor. She passed away peacefully at home after a long illness on April 29, 2020. She is survived by her devoted daughter Kathleen Nicolini. She was preceded in death by her husband John Nicolini, who was the love of her life, her beloved parents Panayiota and Nicholas Vlahos, her brothers Louis Shepherd, Deno Vlahos, James Vlahos and her sister Rose Vlahos. She was also preceded in death by Helen Karmangianis Bernardi, with whom she was best friends since the age of four. "Auntie Kay" is survived by Helen's girls, Joanne Bernardi, Cynthia Bernardi and Maria Bernardi and Helen's adored grandchild Alexandra Roeser (John). Father Constantine Aliferakis conducted a funeral liturgy on May 5, 2020 at St. George Greek Orthodox Church I Schererville Indiana followed by interment at Ridgelawn Cemetery. In this era of the pandemic, there was no wake or memorial dinner. The remembrances of Katherine by all of her family and friends were unable to be shared. Here are a few sweet memories of Katherine "Kay" Nicolini. She grew up in the tight knit Greek Community of Indiana Harbor. Her father Nicholas was on the first church board of St. George. My mother remembered going to the first liturgy. She has new shoes… black patent Mary Janes. She and her brothers were active in Church. She attended the Plato Greek School, acted in Greek language plays and recited Greek poems on Greek Independence Day, She attended Washington High School with her brother Jimmy and was featured in many revues, The first song she ever sang in public was "Deep Purple". After high school she also sang with a Big Band, chaperoned by her brothers, of course. To the shock of some Greeks, she married my Italian father, John Nicolini in 1944. She joined my father in San Diego where he was in the U.S. Marine Corps. While she was there, she worked in the defense industry. When my father shipped out for Iwo Jima, she returned to Indiana Harbor to await his return. Throughout her life she was active in the Greek Community. Here is what her church had to say about her. Kay was a founding member of our church, and was currently the oldest living member of our parish. She was heavily involved in our community and its organizations. She was an active member of The Ladies Philoptochos Society and Daughters of Penelope. In her later years, as most would be slowing down, she became a member of the St. George Parish Council, serving as our first female Parish Council President. Her commitment to our community was unparalleled. She served on too many committees to mention and always looked for the betterment of her beloved St. George. She single handedly raised over $800,000 over the years for Greekfest sponsorships. She greeted parishioners warmly every Sunday and welcomed all our guests with open arms. To our youth, she was "Yia Yia" Nicolini, the nice lady that greeted them at the door on their way to Sunday School. Whether you knew her for a lifetime or just met her, you admired her kindness and her incredible sense of style. She joins her beloved husband John and her parents, brothers and sister in heaven. Our deepest sympathies to her daughter, Kathy. We will miss you Kay! Thank you for making our community a better place. May your memory be eternal. Mom, I will love you forever.

Authorities in Assam's Kaziranga National Park have found the carcass of a semi-adult male, taking the number of tiger deaths in the park to four this year.P Sivakumar, director of the park, said the carcass of the two- year-old tiger was found in the Burapahar range of the 430 sq km park, the biggest habitat of one-horned rhinos in the world."The carcass was found on Friday. It bore several injury marks and the skull was almost crushed. Investigation suggests that it had died due to infighting with other male tigers the previous day," he said.This is the second such death reported this month and the fourth one this year. All cases are the outcome of infighting.On May 10, the carcass of a semi-adult tigress was found in the Bagori range and in April an adult tiger was found dead in the Kohora range. In January, the carcass of a three-month-old tiger was found.Kaziranga was declared a tiger reserve in 2006 and with 121 Royal Bengal Tigers, it has one of the highest density of the species in the world."In Kaziranga, tiger deaths are mostly due to infighting and not old age. In a year, the average number of such deaths is nearly 10. In other parks, prey base is low, the number of tigers is also low and the area is much larger. So they don't have many instances of infighting," said Sivakumar.In the latest instance, forest officials have also detected cannibalism with parts of the dead tiger's body consumed by other tigers."The skull was broken and face disfigured. It appears the attacker, a fully grown adult aged around 10-12 years, might have crushed it. The semi-adult tiger was not able to survive the attack. In this case, we also noticed cannibalism," said Sivakumar.Though it is peak tourist season, all national parks, wildlife sanctuaries and zoos in Assam have been closed since March 16 as a precautionary measure against the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).

Liberty Global ended months of speculation, agreeing to purchase the remaining interest in Dutch cable operator Ziggo in a cash and stock deal valued at about $13.7 billion.


  Liberty, which already owns a 28.5% interest in the Dutch cable company, has been in talks with Ziggo since August. In October, Ziggo rejected a Liberty takeover proposal as “inadequate.”


  Liberty will combine its existing Dutch operations – UPC Netherlands – with Ziggo, reaching a combined 7 million homes, with about 4 million unique customers. The deal is expected to close in the second half of this year.


  As part of the agreement, which values the Dutch cabler at about 34.53 euros per share ($47.18), Ziggo shareholders will receive 11 euros ($15.03) in cash and the rest in Liberty Global stock.

Per un periodo, quando dirigeva il commissariato di una realta assai delicata qual e Licata e dove arrivo nel dicembre del 2002, fu anche sottoposto a tutela per la sua esposizione al rischio nel condurre indagini delicatissime di polizia giudiziaria. Proprio a Licata, Carlo Mossuto porto a segno operazioni antimafia dal calibro di "Progresso" e "Progresso 2", nonche quella anti-usura "Sciacallo" del novembre del 2007. L'essersi speso con tutte le sue forze, il cuore e le capacita \- anche per gestire il "fronte" immigratorio che, all'epoca, si era aperto proprio sul Licatese - ha fatto si che gli venisse concessa anche la cittadinanza onoraria.

24] We ask the court to return to the Crown's case in relation to Mr McLean. The fact of no irregularities being noted against Mr McLean's name at the time when the cheques were encashed is immaterial. A supervisor reviewing cheques at the end of the business day or at lunch time would not be instructive on the issue of the identity of the person who in fact encashed the cheque. By way of illustration, according to Melissa McFarlane, outside of the day when Mr McLean called her out of the line and processed a cheque for her, that she did not work for, she had not gone back to the bank and encashed any other cheques. However, cheques signed "M McFarlane" were subsequently processed by Mr McLean on several occasions and often in close succession. When a supervisor reviews any such instrument there would be no irregularity noted, as the cheque, on the face of it, would have appeared to have been properly endorsed.

A coalition of activist groups has declared Feb. 11 as The Day We Fight Black, combining activism against NSA data collection and celebrating the anniversary of the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) blackout.


  The protest was announced on the eve of the anniversary of the death of Aaron Swartz.


  "Today the greatest threat to a free Internet, and broader free society, is the National Security Agency's mass spying regime," said David Segal, executive director and cofounder of Demand Progress. "If Aaron were alive he'd be on the front lines, fighting back against these practices that undermine our ability to engage with each other as genuinely free human beings."


  Swartz was the Internet activist who died of an apparent suicide Jan. 11 while awaiting trial on multiple felony charges for allegedly using MIT computers to illegally download scientific journals.


  Swartz was among those who helped defeat SOPA by marshalling opposition to the bill and was instrumental in the blackout, in which dozens of Web sites went dark to demonstrate against it, including Google, Mozilla, Wikipedia and Craigslist.


  Demand Progress, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, Fight for the Future, Free Press, Boing Boing, Reddit and Mozilla are joining in the day of activism, on which they say they will "make calls and drive emails to lawmakers." In addition, the Web sites will display "banners" encouraging Web surfers to "fight back against surveillance," and "employees of technology companies will demand that their organizations do the same."


  A spokesperson for the effort said they were not advocating for hacking or altering sites.

OK, another csb:      I was once part of the Tolkein fan community on AOL, long long ago, pre-HTTP, pre-WWW, when it was the only internet access available except for even clunkier FIDO email and news gateways.      Anyway, we once had an IRL meetup on the Oregon coast.  Including a beach day.      One woman had found a "Palantir" somewhere and brought it with her.  A 4" diameter glass sphere.  She carried it with her everywhere she went. Including to the beach this one fine day.      I should point out here, this woman's grasp on reality was already blurred. Middle-earth was real history.  To her, we are descendants of the Third Age race of men, real elves and dwarves once roamed the world, and the magic isn't entirely gone.      It was pretty overcast, so it wasn't until we were headed back to the cars when the sun peeked out momentarily from behind the clouds.      All of a sudden she yelped and threw the "Palantir" to the ground.  "It burned me!!"      I put two and two together instantly.  I was in fact using glass spheres to couple and collimate laser light at the ends of optical fibers at the job I worked then...  And I should have realized the hazard before it happened.      But instead, I told her "Sauron has the other Palantir, you know."      She freaked.  She completely lost it.  Of course that was why it burned her. It scared the living shiat out of her.      But she didn't give up the Palantir.  She wrapped it up in a sweater, then found a Crown Royal bag to keep it in.

Instead, it looks like Google will focus more on value, with a mid-range processor to go along with a more affordable price. This is a smart move on Google’s part, because it looks like Apple may launch an iPhone 12 for as low as $649,…

Station groups have been bulking up big-time since last year’s NATPE show, which means that those groups now have more leverage over what shows get produced and how they are distributed.
 Consolidation, however, can cut both ways. In the 1980s, production companies’ successful effort to get the FCC’s fin-syn rules deep-sixed led to consolidation in syndication that reduced the number of sellers stations could go to for shows.
 Station consolidation has now put the shoe on the other foot. But since the shoes are Brunos and Blahniks, it’s still a good business from both sides of the equation. SVOD may be making inroads, but TV stations continue to have a trump card.
 Broadcasters in Washington continue to play the “free” card in arguments for preserving a healthy over-the-air industry after the incentive auctions, but the other side of that card is the “ad-supported” that keeps the service free and keeps broadcasters in the front of the line for top shows in syndication.
 Paige Albiniak’s cover story in this issue illustrates how quickly things change and how dramatically different the business looks than it did last year, so it’s more important than ever for our business community to come together face to face—as it will do this week in Miami Beach—to make peanut butter cups out of the chocolate and the peanut butter.
 We encourage this spirit of partnership we see emerging. It may be born of necessity, but that lineage often produces inventive programming and business models. The business will need both. It will also need some certainty out of Washington about over-the-top distribution and copyright protections if programming is to sustain the quality that takes money and the confidence to invest it. That means the Supreme Court needs to speed its deliberations on Aereo, on which some of that future rests.
 Relationships can be maintained remotely, but they are built and nurtured in person, where ideas become concepts and Emmy-winning shows. We all know developing an idea or hearing inspiration is far more likely when you’re there in person with other members of the community. Making a deal on a cocktail napkin, coming up with ideas over a meal or listening to a visionary on stage: Those are the same things that inspired this event more than 40 years ago, when station programmers got together to see how they might partner and share in the fruits of their distribution labors.
 That is why we’ve been covering NATPE since the first show, and syndication since the days of Frederick Ziv and the Cisco Kid. It also explains why we continue to commit to covering the show like no one else, and why we mount two dozen-plus events of our own each year, making sure that faceto- face does not become e-mail-to-text message.
 We look forward to seeing you there, reporting on the latest and greatest from the talented people who make this such a great business to bird-dog.

Complete Coverage: CES 2014
 FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler will appear at a town hall meeting in Oakland, Calif., Jan. 9 to talk about the impact of media consolidation, and make a policy speech while on that West Coast swing next week.      Free Press, one of the sponsors of the event, announced the appearance. An FCC source confirmed Wheeler will be there, as well as confirming that the chairman would be making a policy speech at another, unnamed, venue.      Wheeler has pledged to engage with groups outside of FCC headquarters and Washington, so that he can hear "the voices of the American people."      The event cosponsors include the Center for Media Justice, Free Press, ColorOfChange and the National Hispanic Media Coalition, all part of the Voices for Internet Freedom Coalition (www.internetvoices.org).
 Wheeler has also been a voice for Internet freedom, which he has pledged to espouse and uphold.      The event is billed as a way for members of the community to "share their stories — and to tell Chairman Wheeler about the impacts of an increasingly corporate media environment" and "to tell Wheeler face to face about the kind of media system that best meets our needs — and to advocate for the health and well-being of our families and our communities.      Wheeler is headed West next week for the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, where he has a Jan. 8 date with Consumer Electronics Association President Gary Shapiro for a one-on-one interview. He is also planning to give a policy speech in California as part of the West Coast swing that will also include some private and public meetings with tech execs and others.

Liverpool, who had brought back Rush in 1988 after a single season in Serie A, started brightly though and the Welsh marksman was inevitably on the scoresheet in an incredible 9-0 demolition job of Crystal Palace on Tuesday September 12 that took the side to the top of the table for the first time.
 The night also saw Aldridge bow out with a goal, coming off the bench to score a penalty in front of the Kop with his first touch of the game on 67 minutes ahead of his move to Real Sociedad.
 As the nights drew in the Reds hit a sticky patch, losing three out of four league games, going down to Southampton 4-1 at the Dell, Coventry City 1-0 at Anfield and Queens Park Rangers 3-2 at Loftus Road.
 A crucial 2-1 home win over defending champions Arsenal on November 26 saw Liverpool leapfrog the Gunners at the summit although they were one of four clubs all on 27 points at the time, including eventual runners-up Aston Villa and Chelsea.
 From that date onwards the Reds were never outside the top two and following a 3-2 comeback victory over Southampton at Anfield on March 31, when trailing 2-1 with 17 minutes to go they eventually triumphed 3-2 to move into first place on goal difference, they remained at the summit throughout the run-in.

Dale E. Perry Dale E. Perry, age 63, passed away at home on Thursday, May 21 surrounded by his devoted wife and two daughters after a well-fought 21-month battle with cancer. Born November 24, 1956, Dale grew up in Hammond, Indiana and graduated in 1975 from Gavit High School. After honing his skills as a bricklayer and a travelling salesman, this jack of all trades transitioned to nursing school at IUN, where he graduated with an R.N. in 1987. He worked for many years in the surgical ICU at St. Francis hospital in Blue Island, IL, and most recently worked in the electrophysiology lab at St. Mary Medical Center in Hobart, IN. At both locations, he gained many wonderful, supportive friends whom he cherished until the end of his life. Dale's favorite use of his free time was spending it with his family. He was the organizer of our many family vacations, day trips, and movie nights. He was a lifelong fan of Chicago sports, but his favorite athletes to watch were his daughters, travelling across country to watch their basketball and softball games. He became impressively adept at catching his daughter's 65+mph fast balls. He was an avid bicyclist, riding a minimum of 1,000 miles each summer. After his diagnosis, he transitioned to indoor stationary cycling, dedicating an hour of time daily up until May 5, 2020. He was a skilled handyman who completed all projects to perfection, and his many home renovations are a testament to his talents. His prized possession was his 2015 Corvette Stingray; he and his wife enjoyed taking it for rides along beautiful country roads and to wineries. He had a wonderful, sarcastic sense of humor and has left us with many quotable moments and stories. Dale is survived by his loving wife of 32 years, Linda (Houck) Perry, and two daughters: Courtney (Daniel Beard) Perry, and Taylor (Joshua Parker) Perry, his mother Joan Perry, his siblings Philip (Trudy) Perry, Ruth Mateja, Carol Rinas, and Jane (Ruben) Guzman, as well as many other supportive friends and family members. He is preceded in death by his father William Perry, and his brother Thomas Perry. A celebration of life party will be held at a future date. Burns Funeral Home, Crown Point entrusted with arrangements. www.burnsfuneral.com.
