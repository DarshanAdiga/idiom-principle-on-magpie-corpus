Mr Barrington said Persimmon Homes has shown a "lack of care and understanding" for Park Derwen residents.
 "Even though they have said they are landscaping they aren’t. It’s children we have got to protect more than anything. I don’t think you will find anyone living here who has a good thing to say about them."
 According to Daniel, his drainage pipes had been "cemented shut" when he moved in to his home in Parc Derwen almost four years ago.
 He said he had to have his shower re-built twice, his driveway relaid twice because it was "sinking" and his garden re-done because "the ground hadn’t been prepared properly".
 "There was an issue with part of the frame for the shower. They had obviously run out of materials at the time and used skirting board."
 Daniel said on one occasion streetlights outside his home were flickering on and off constantly.
 "At one point it was like having a rave. It was on and off for about a day or so and then it got sorted. We have got an awful lot of young kids on this estate. We don’t want them walking around the place in the street."
 Both Daniel and Mr Barrington said contractors were operating heavy machinery and driving trucks through the estate during school pick-up hours, despite Persimmon Homes promising this would not happen.
 "There was meant to be no traffic coming through during the school rush hour but we would always have the trucks arriving causing traffic," said Daniel.

In the example above, the venue operator will buy an asset sold on the maker exchange for $98, the lowest price available, while simultaneously selling that asset on the taker exchange for $99. Their inventory levels remain the same, and they not only haven’t lost capital but have actually made a small profit of $1. Likewise, the operator can sell an asset for the best offer they encounter on the maker exchange — $101 — while simultaneously recovering that inventory without losing any capital by repurchasing it on the taker exchange for $100.

His first day on the base is a freewheeling exploratory mission that sees him careening through skeptical throngs of military members, meeting social butterfly Britney (Francesca Scorcese) and swigging cheap wine until he finally tumbles back home. Frasier is a furious live wire that no one, least of all himself, quite understands -- until he meets Caitlin (Jordan Kristine Seamon), his watchful neighbor whom he comes to know as Harper.

Police killed the brothers two days later after a manhunt.
 Fourteen suspected accomplices are on trial in connection with the Charlie Hebdo attack, and with a related attack on a Jewish supermarket.
 The killings sparked a series of attacks on French soil, including "lone wolf" attacks by people said to be inspired by the Islamic State group that have since claimed more than 250 lives.
 Hearings began last week under heavy security as eleven of the suspects faced the court on charges of conspiracy in a terrorist act or association with a terror group.
 Three others, including the wife of one of the gunmen, are being tried in absentia because they fled to IS-held territory in Syria days before the attacks.

Operators on the maker exchange use those bid and offer prices to set market-making conditions at their own venue, oftentimes with a markup to the source exchange.

 # Man killed, woman hurt in shootout at Detroit house party
 James David Dickson
 The Detroit News
 View Comments
 Detroit — A Labor Day house party on Detroit's east side ended early Monday morning in a shootout that left one man dead, one woman wounded and a man on the run from police.
 The fatal shootout took place about 4 a.m. on the 13200 block of Gable. That's south of East McNichols and east of Mound.
 Officer Holly Lance, a Detroit Police Department spokeswoman, said there was an argument between two men, 24 and 26.
 People tried to separate them, but the men both allegedly pulled guns out and started shooting.
 The 24-year-old man, a CPL holder, was fatally wounded. But before he died he got some shots off, police say.
 In the crossfire, a 29-year-old woman was also shot.
 Medics transported her to a hospital, where she's listed in temporary serious condition.

He should also be contributing to a TFSA to have his savings build tax-free. If his timeline to purchase a home is one year, he should be conservatively invested with his down payment funds, likely in a savings account or other near-cash investment. Stocks fall about one-third of the time on an annual basis, so it would be unfortunate to invest aggressively and have to sell stocks if they were down a year from now.

Smith was tased and arrested at the scene and faces charges including resisting arrest, reckless endangerment, discharging a firearm into an occupied building and second-degree assault related to injuring an officer while being taken into custody, according to NBC 15.
 A woman was also taken into custody at the same time but her role or relationship to Smith is unclear.
 Smith’s family said it was common for people in the area to have that many guns for hunting. His cousin, Rev. Al Smith, said he had been acting “a little different” recently after the death of his mother.
 “I talked with him two or three days ago and he wasn’t acting just like himself,” the reverend told NBC 15. “I remember telling him I said, ’Cuz, take it easy. It’s gonna be all right,’ and he said to me, he said, ’I love you but people just don’t understand.’”

 In this challenging time of COVID-19, Sam Fuld still maintains a sense of humor.
   
 "It's been wild," said the Durham native, who spent eight seasons in Major League Baseball as a player, and is now in his third year working for the Philadelphia Phillies. "Every second of the day is weird. I go to the ballpark and I'm down in the clubhouse when needed."
   
 Once the game starts, Fuld says, "I'm usually in the stands amongst the cardboard cutouts, watching from behind home plate. It's eerie. It's not what you're used to. You start talking to your cardboard buddy next to you. You feel like you're Tom Hanks in (the 2000 movie) Cast Away. It's odd."
      
 But Fuld, like all of Major League Baseball, is slowly getting used to the current situation. The major leagues are playing a shortened 60-game schedule that ends on Sept. 27. An expanded 16-team postseason will follow.
   
 Fuld's Phillies are 19-17 as of Monday morning, which has them in second place in the National League East, three games behind Atlanta (24-16).
   
 "Every day we do this it's a little bit more normal," said Fuld, who has a new job this year with the Phillies, leading their Integrated Baseball Performance Department. "It's cool to see baseball. That's the bottom line. Guys are competing. At least from my perspective, it's great to see the high-level competition. Guys aren't just going through the motions. There's some serious energy out there, which is great. That's the name of the game. That's what I love about sports -- just the competitive side of it. I don't think that's getting cut short despite the circumstances."
   
 Fuld also thinks players are handling COVID protocols better than they did at the beginning of the season in July.
   
 "Those early scares woke everybody up," he said. "Players, coaches and staff are being really good about being safe and following protocol. They recognize this is the only way we're going to get through this season."
   
 Continued vigilance is a must. "There's a balance," Fuld said. "We worry a lot about guys getting too comfortable after two or three weeks of nothing but negative tests. You can't let your guard down. There's still a lot of season left."
   
 With his new job, Fuld said, "We're collaborating between our strength and conditioning department, athletic training department and nutrition department. Getting everybody on the same page.
   
 "The idea is to develop a plan for each player. They are all inter-related. In the past baseball has tended to work in silos. You stay in your lane. You stay in yours. I don't think that's the best way to go about finding ways to get guys to achieve as much as they can."
   
 As an example, Fuld cited an outfielder working on his swing. "It's important to understand how your body works and what your physical limitations may be," he said, "what can you potentially work on in the training room or the weight room. Maybe there's some diet-related things that can help you. What I believe is to look at things from a holistic perspective. We have these pieces in place in Philly already. We've put an added emphasis on communicating amongst these groups, formulating a plan for everybody, getting everybody's input -- hitting coaches, pitching coaches. Linking those goals to what we can and can't do from a physical standpoint."
   
 The same day that Fuld, 38, retired as a player in 2017, he was hired by the Phillies as their major player information coordinator.
   
 Two years ago his wife Sarah and their four children, ages 4 to 10, moved to a house in Philly. This week their kids begin in-person learning at a local private school.
   
 "We're just a six-hour drive from New Hampshire," Fuld said. "It's part of the reason I took the job (in Philadelphia) to be closer to our roots. My wife is from New York. It's a good situation for her and her family as well."
   
 Fuld's parents still live in N.H. Recently the family drove to the Granite State to visit, spending a few days at a friend's house on Swains Lake in Barrington.
   
 As the season winds down to the playoffs, Fuld finds himself getting more comfortable during an uncomfortable time; although, he is never completely at ease.
   
 With no spectators allowed at games, teams are piping in various levels of crowd noise. Still it's not the real thing, bringing into sharper focus what one hears from the game on the field. "Everything sounds like it's a 700-foot home run," Fuld said. "It's hard to adjust to that. Everything's loud."
   
 The finish line is in sight with the end of September looming. "We're all cautiously optimistic that we'll get through this and through the playoffs," Fuld said. "Hopefully we're part of the playoffs. We're over a month in now. A lot of people wouldn't have betted on us getting to where we are. It's been pretty great to see guys adjust."

The technology is designed to quickly track and warn users who have been in prolonged contact with somebody who has tested positive for COVID-19. Users of the app who test positive for the virus are given a Covidcode, which they can voluntarily submit in SwissCovid. This anonymously triggers an avalanche of warnings to other users who were registered as close contacts of the symptomatic person while they were infectious.
 Researchers from the EPFL University in Lausanne, who developed the technology, have now published preliminary results about the technology's efficiency. They found that, between the end of July and the end of August, 1,054 Covidcodes were submitted in the app. Understanding the exact impact of submitting those codes, however, is much trickier.
 SwissCovid is built on a protocol called Decentralized Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing (DP3T), which also forms the basis of the Bluetooth contact- tracing API developed by Apple and Google. The protocol means that alerts can only be issued locally, on users' phones, instead of going through a central server. There is no way, therefore, of knowing how many warnings have been issued by the app and to whom.
 When they receive a warning, however, users are directed to a telephone hotline that was set up specifically to provide advice for those who were identified as risky contacts by the app. The SwissCovid hotline received 874 calls during the time of the study, which the researchers said was reflective of the number of alerts that might have been triggered.
 For Marcel Salathé, digital epidemiologist from EPFL University, who developed SwissCovid, the numbers should ease the concerns of those who initially believed the app could pick up on contacts that are not epidemiologically relevant and generate huge amounts of false positives.

After auditioning multiple players at the spot in training camp, Bradley Bozeman was the starter, and he went on to start every game that season.

ATHENS, Greece (AP) - Greece´s coast guard says one of its patrol boats stopped a sailboat off the coast of the southern island of Crete after it was found to have been carrying dozens of migrants.
 The Italian-flagged Marly had been sailing off the southwestern coast of Crete when it raised suspicion and was put under surveillance, the coast guard said.
 It later stopped on the western coast of Crete, where 11 people disembarked before the vessel headed off away from the island and would not respond to calls from the coast guard, authorities said.
 The sailboat was stopped and led to a harbor in southern Crete, where 59 migrants were found on board. Of the total 70 people who had been on the Marly, 13 were children and seven were women, the coast guard said.
 The migrants were all transferred to the town of Chania in the north of the island.
 Greece is one of the main entry points into the European Union for thousands of people fleeing poverty and conflict in the Middle East, Africa and Asia. Most head to Aegean islands from the nearby Turkish coast, but Greek authorities have said a more recent trend is for larger boats to attempt to sail south of Crete and head toward Italy.

But Hastings makes a persuasive case that Netflix has successfully codified its processes — and yes, it still has many of those — that buck age-old conventional wisdom.

Crypto Szene Schweiz (@CryptoSzene) September 6, 2020 Some other users urged Binance to jump on the bandwagon and list BNSD. As the FXStreet previously reported, the cryptocurrency exchange had added several DeFi tokens recently, including the controversial SUSHI and RUNE. The cryptocurrency community turned against the trading platform for fuelling the DeFi mania and supporting risky and potentially fraudulent projects. However, the head of the exchange, Chanpeng Zhao, reacted to the criticism by saying that innovations require risk-taking. Notably, he also added that all users should assess the risks and by themselves. As one of the leaders of the space, we support innovation. With innovation comes the chance of high reward and high risk. Some projects make it to the moon, while some fall short. Always manage your risk accordingly. What's next for BNSD The coin has already lost over 46% from the all-time high, and the downside correction may gain traction, especially if the DeFi-space continues to cool down. The star of BNSD may go down as quickly as it has risen.",

 Nelson thinks Instagram catapulted her into a new realm of the cooking industry. Which is helping her use her skills to teach people how to cook but also providing her with a new stream of revenue.

Damascus and a Russian delegation Monday discussed economic cooperation to help counter Western sanctions on Syria, during Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov's first visit to the war-torn country since 2012.
 Russia has been a key ally of the Damascus government since the start of the country's war in 2011, providing critical military backing and signing several major economic deals.
 Meeting a Russian delegation headed by Lavrov, President Bashar al-Assad said "the Syrian government was determined to continue working with Russian partners", to implement signed agreements and encourage the "success of Russian investments in Syria", the presidency said.
 They discussed possible new agreements "in the interest of both countries and to alleviate the impact of a policy of sanctions" by Western countries against government-held areas of Syria, it added in a statement.
 The Russian visit comes as Damascus struggles to redress a war-battered economy, further hindered by Western sanctions including under the US Caesar Act, implemented since mid-June.
 Damascus and Moscow have signed several deals in recent years in energy, construction and agriculture.
 They include one for Russian firm Stroytransgaz to take over Syria's largest port of Tartous for 49 years.
 Another deal awarded the same company a 50-year concession to extract phosphate in the central region of Palmyra.
 Russian Deputy Prime Minister Yury Borisov told reporters that a new economic and trade deal was in the works, which he hoped could be signed during another trip to Syria in December.
 \- 'Economic blockade' -
 The proposed accord, now under review by Damascus, includes around 40 projects, Borisov said, including the rehabilitation of power plants and hydrocarbon exploration in Syrian waters in the Mediterranean.
 "Syria's economic isolation" with Western sanctions were hampering foreign investment, Borisov said.
 "It's an economic blockade that we are trying to break through our common efforts," he added.
 President Vladimir Putin made his first trip to Damascus in Syria's nine-year- old war in January, after a previous visit to the Russian base of Hmeimim on the Mediterranean coast in 2017.
 Moscow's military intervention in 2015 helped turn the tide of the war, with Russian air power allowing Syrian government forces to win back large parts of the country from rebels and jihadists.
 With UN-led peace talks floundering in recent years, Moscow and rebel backer Turkey have emerged as the main powerbrokers in alternative negotiations.
 A UN-backed committee is supposed to be discussing Syria's post-war constitution.
 Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Muallem told a press conference they "would decide if they want to amend the current constitution or produce a new one".
 "In both cases, the result will be submitted to a referendum," he said.
 After Syria, Lavrov was due to head to nearby Cyprus.
 Syria's conflict has ravaged the country's economy, killed more than 380,000 people and displaced millions since it erupted in 2011 with the repression of anti-government protests.

However, Jose Mourinho's Chelsea side was the ones who fully exploited what a fast Premier League start could offer to a team. They tapped into something that hadn't been previously explored where they accumulated 23 points from 10 games at the beginning. This was in the 2004/05 season, after which the team went on to clinch the league title that year with a massive point tally.

Still, what’s true for one movie is not typically true for all movies. While _The New Mutants’_ second week numbers debunk the idea that people will just more casually space out their moviegoing experience for all movies moving forward, some movies may yet enjoy a slightly longer shelf life. It’s worth noting, for example, that _Unhinged_ has seen lower total overall profit, but has seemingly held a little better during its theatrical run. (Plus it's worth noting, _Unhinged_ has a much lower budget and easier path to profitability.) That film saw a 34.9% drop domestically between its first weekend of wider release and its second. The subsequent weekend also only saw a drop of 35.9%. A good hold in the past would have been around 40%, so the idea that some movies may have longer legs is not totally without warrant here. It just didn’t work for _The New Mutants_.

When Cam Newton signed his one-year deal with the Patriots in July, many wondered how the veteran quarterback would coexist with Bill Belichick. Newton even admitted himself that he wondered how he would get along with the Patriots' head coach.
   
 As the Patriots get ready for their first game of the 2020 season, Newton says his relationship with Belichick has been great and calls his situation with the Patriots a perfect match.
   
 "I didn't know what to expect, and I am just being as honest as I possibly can because I know you guys want to hear," Newton told WEEI's "The Greg Hill Show" on Monday morning. "I didn't know what to expect. Just the same questions that a lot of people and talk shows, gossip talk, barber shop talk, chit-chatter, text messages -- they wanted to know, I wanted to know as well. I wanted to know is it real what they say about Belichick? Just, I didn't know.
      
 "Honestly, it's been a match made in heaven for me just knowing I am at a place where everything is pulling in the same direction and everything is geared towards winning. Coming from a person that has won at all levels, I feel as if that if I do the things the right way, trusting the same people who have gotten me to this point and trust their coaching, I think this is something that when you look at an opportunity in a timely manner, it can be accomplished."
   
 Newton is off to a good start in New England. Last week, Belichick named the veteran the team's starting quarterback during a team meeting. On the same day, Newton was also named a Patriots captain. This summer, it was clear that he was getting along with his Patriots teammates, who have been lauding his energy on and off the football field.
   
 When it comes to Belichick, there are a lot of preconceived notions about how things are run inside Gillette Stadium. Is it all work and no play? Do players actually not have any fun? Is Belichick too tough on his players? Then there comes Newton, who isn't afraid to show emotion or dance on the football field. How would someone with an eccentric personality fit in with Belichick?
   
 Newton had the same questions, but said it took one phone call with his new head coach to get his answers.
   
 "I think every type of stereotype that I had about Coach Belichick changed the day I talked to him," Newton said. "You look at the linage of players he's had over the years -- obviously the Bradys, the Randy Moss's, the Corey Dillons, the Lawrence Taylors, and the list goes on,Tedy Bruschi -- it's no wonder why he's sustained success over the years. ... If he was able to accomplish those things with those players, it made a lot of sense. The time when I spoke to him and obviously meeting with him face-to-face, it removed any type of doubt, if I even had any. It's just exciting to play for a person like that."
   
 On Monday, Belichick was asked about Newton's comments and said it's been a pleasure coaching the quarterback.
   
 "He's done everything we've asked him to do, he works hard, he's obviously a very talented player," Belichick said. "I'm looking forward to continuing to work with him. We'll just take it day by day, but he's given us everything he's had."
   
 Belichick still evaluating the kicker position
   
 We thought the winner of the Patriots' kicking competition would be evident by cut-down day. Instead, we're still guessing as the Patriots are still evaluating their kicking situation after cutting both kickers and then re- signing Nick Folk and Justin Rohrwasser to the practice squad.
   
 On Monday, Belichick wouldn't say who would kick in the team's opener against Miami this weekend, but did mention he liked the team's depth at the position.
   
 "Nick's come in and obviously done a good job with us as we put him on the practice squad and want to continue to work with him," Belichick said. "So, we'll just take it from there and see how it goes. He's done a good job and hit the ball well. Justin has as well. Certainly, there's a big experience gap here. That's not uncommon, either. Again, just make the best decisions we can on that. We're fortunate we have two players at that position that are, I'd say NFL quality. Similar to the quarterback position. We're fortunate to depth at those spots and those are good ones to have them in."

Gareth Southgate has hinted he may look to play with a back three when England face Denmark in the Nations League on Tuesday night.
 The Three Lions head to Copenhagen on the back of a narrow 1-0 victory over Iceland on Saturday.
 Southgate opted for a flat back four in Reykjavik as Kieran Trippier filled in at left-back and Eric Dier dropped in to partner Joe Gomez in the heart of the defence.
 That could change next time out as Southgate looks to keep his options open moving towards next summer’s European Championship.
 Trent Alexander-Arnold is expected to replace the suspended Kyle Walker on the right, while late call-ups Conor Coady and Ainsley Maitland-Niles both suit a formation with three centre-backs.
 “We’ve tried things in training across the week with a long-term view on different possibilities for us as a team,” said Southgate, who used a back three throughout the run to the 2018 World Cup semi-finals.

 After leaving Sunderland, Graham signed a permanent deal with Blackburn and scored 45 league goals in 108 appearances.
 “It’s been in the pipeline for a number of weeks now so I’m delighted the deal is done and it feels great to be here,” Graham told Sunderland’s official website. “I’m looking forward to the challenge that lies ahead.”
 Sunderland manager Phil Parkinson added: “I’m delighted to welcome Danny to the club. He provides us with another option and more competition at the top end of the pitch, and he is another excellent addition to the squad.”

This likely contributed to the airplane touching down on the nose landing gear first, as evidenced by the black tire marks in an S-shaped (sinusoidal) pattern co- located with white paint transfer marks on the surface of the runway…. After bouncing during the second landing, the pilot added engine power to conduct a go-around, allowed the airplane’s pitch to rapidly increase, and entered a steep left turn before attaining a proper climb speed, which resulted in a loss of control.”
