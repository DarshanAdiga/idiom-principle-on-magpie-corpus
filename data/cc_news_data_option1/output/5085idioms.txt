In South Dakota, Dr. Clay Smith has treated hundreds of COVID-19 patients while working at Monument Health Spearfish Hospital and at Sheridan Memorial Hospital in neighboring Wyoming.
 He said patients are becoming stranded in the emergency room for hours while they await beds on the main floor or transfers to larger hospitals. And those transfers are becoming more challenging, with some patients sent as far away as Denver, 400 miles from the two hospitals.
 “That is a huge burden for families and EMS systems as well when you take an ambulance and send it 400 miles one way, that ambulance is out of the community for essentially a whole day,” he said.
 Smith added that some patients have gone from thinking “I thought this was a hoax” to “Wow, this is real and I feel terrible.” But he has also seen people with COVID-19 who “continue to be disbelievers. It is hard to see that.”
 “At the end of the day the virus doesn’t care whether you believe in it or not,” he said.

There's no guarantee the men will win their case or collect anything from the agents. Thomas noted that the agents can argue that they should be shielded from any judgment by the doctrine of qualified immunity, which the Supreme Court has said protects officials as long as their actions don’t violate clearly established law or constitutional rights they should have known about.
 Lori Windham, senior counsel at the public interest law firm the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, said governments too often change policies to avoid court judgments. “We’re glad the Supreme Court unanimously emphasized that the government can’t expect to be let off the hook by simply changing its tune at the last second. This is a good decision that makes it easier to hold the government accountable when it violates Americans’ religious liberties," Windham said.
 In recent years, the court has ruled in favor of people and companies asserting claims under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, or the Constitution’s guarantee of religious liberty.
 The decision involving the no-fly list was among four issued Thursday in cases that were argued in October.
 In the others, all decided unanimously, the court:
 —Reinstated convictions for rape by a military officer and two enlisted men, reversing a military court ruling that had thrown them out because too much time had elapsed between the assaults and the prosecutions. The cases involve women who for different reasons initially decided not to press charges but later changed their minds. The crimes all were committed before 2006. The Uniform Code of Military Justice has been changed so that there is no statute of limitations on rape charges.
 —Revived a provision of the Delaware Constitution, struck down by a lower court, that requires that appointments to Delaware’s major courts reflect a partisan balance. The justices did not rule on the substance of the requirement. Instead they held that lawyer James R. Adams, a political independent who challenged the provision, didn’t have the legal right to do so because he had not shown that at the time he brought his lawsuit that he was “able and ready” to apply to be a judge.
 —Reversed lower-court decisions that had prevented an Arkansas pharmacy law passed in 2015 from going into effect. The law, Act 900, was enacted to ensure that pharmacies are fully reimbursed for the cost of drugs they dispense to customers.
 Justice Amy Coney Barrett had not yet joined the court when the cases were argued and did not take part in the decisions.

The rate of sea level rise has doubled since then to 0.16 inch (4 millimeters) per year, almost entirely due to the combination of meltwater from land-based glaciers and ice sheets and the fact that seawater expands as it warms, NASA said.
 TOPEX-Poseidon familiarized the public with the concept of ocean surface topography with data turned into brightly colored graphics of the globe showing warming and cooling water marking weather-influencing El Nino and La Nina conditions.
 TOPEX-Poseidon was followed by a series of satellites including the current Jason-3.
 Sometime this month, Sentinel-6 will be moved higher from an initial orbit to its operational orbit, where it will trail Jason-3 by 30 seconds so scientists can cross-check the data to ensure continuity. When that is assured, Sentinel-6 will become the primary satellite.
 In addition to NASA, the mission involves the European Space Agency, the European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites, the European Commission, France’s National Center for Space Studies, and the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

Adds Egypt and UAE welcome move)
 By Steve Holland
 WASHINGTON, Dec 10 (Reuters) - Israel and Morocco agreed on Thursday to normalize relations in a deal brokered with U.S. help, making Morocco the fourth Arab country to set aside hostilities with Israel in the past four months.
 It joins the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Sudan in beginning to forge deals with Israel, driven in part by U.S.-led efforts to present a united front against Iran and roll back Tehran's regional influence.
 In a departure from longstanding U.S. policy, President Donald Trump agreed as part of the deal to recognize Morocco's sovereignty over the Western Sahara, a desert region where a decades-old territorial dispute has pitted Morocco against the Algeria-backed Polisario Front, a breakaway movement that seeks to establish an independent state in the territory.
 President-elect Joe Biden, due to succeed Trump on Jan. 20, will face a decision whether to accept the U.S. deal on the Western Sahara, which no other Western nation has done. A Biden spokesman declined to comment on the move.
 While Biden is expected to move U.S. foreign policy away from Trump's "America First" posture, the Democrat has indicated he will continue the pursuit of what Trump calls "the Abraham Accords" between Israel and Arab and Muslim nations.
 Trump sealed the Israel-Morocco accord in a phone call with Morocco's King Mohammed VI on Thursday, the White House said.
 "Another HISTORIC breakthrough today! Our two GREAT friends Israel and the Kingdom of Morocco have agreed to full diplomatic relations – a massive breakthrough for peace in the Middle East!" Trump tweeted.
 Mohammed told Trump that Morocco intends to facilitate direct flights for Israeli tourists to and from Morocco, according to a statement from Morocco's royal court.
 "This will be a very warm peace. Peace has never - the light of peace on this Hanukkah day has never - shone brighter than today in the Middle East," Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement, referring to a Jewish eight-day holiday starting on Thursday night.
 Palestinians have been critical of the normalization deals, saying Arab countries have set back the cause of peace by abandoning a longstanding demand that Israel give up land for a Palestinian state before it can receive recognition.
 Egypt and UAE issued statements welcoming Morocco's decision to normalize ties with Israel. Egypt and Israel signed a peace treaty in 1979.
 "This step, a sovereign move, contributes to strengthening our common quest for stability, prosperity, and just and lasting peace in the region," the crown prince of Abu Dhabi, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan, wrote on Twitter.
 The Morocco deal could be among the last that Trump's team, led by White House senior adviser Jared Kushner and U.S. envoy Avi Berkowitz, will negotiate before giving way to Biden's incoming administration.
 Kushner told reporters on a conference call it was inevitable that Saudi Arabia would eventually strike a similar deal with Israel. A U.S. official said the Saudis were not likely to act until after Biden takes over, and even then there would be strong internal opposition that could block such a move in the near term.
 FULL DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS
 Under the agreement, Morocco will establish full diplomatic relations and resume official contacts with Israel.
 "They are going to reopen their liaison offices in Rabat and Tel Aviv immediately with the intention to open embassies. And they are going to promote economic cooperation between Israeli and Moroccan companies," Kushner told Reuters.
 Trump's agreement to change U.S. policy toward the Western Sahara was the linchpin for getting Morocco's agreement and a major shift away from a mostly neutral stance.
 In Rabat, Morocco's royal court said Washington will open a consulate in Western Sahara as part of Morocco's deal with Israel.
 A White House proclamation said the United States believes that an independent Sahrawi state is "not a realistic option for resolving the conflict and that genuine autonomy under Moroccan sovereignty is the only feasible solution."
 "We urge the parties to engage in discussions without delay, using Morocco's autonomy plan as the only framework to negotiate a mutually acceptable solution," it said.
 Washington had supported a 1991 ceasefire between Morocco and the Western Sahara's Polisario Front independence movement that called for a referendum to resolve the issue. Last month, after a border incident, the Polisario pulled out of that deal and announced a return to armed struggle.
 A representative of the Polisario Front independence movement for Western Sahara said it "regrets highly" the U.S. change in policy, which it called "strange but not surprising."
 "This will not change an inch of the reality of the conflict and the right of the people of Western Sahara to self determination," the Polisario's Europe representative Oubi Bchraya said.
 One more Middle East breakthrough is possible. Kushner and his team last week traveled to Saudi Arabia and Qatar seeking an end to a three-year rift between Doha and the Gulf Cooperation Council countries.

Busby had a quick response. "We are following the guidelines for traveling safely. There is a way to travel and stay safe," he wrote. "We aren't doing a single thing that is against the law. If you think you can't walk out of your door without getting a serious illness, then by all means stay home."


  In November, the Busbys began receiving criticism from fans who were disappointed to see them travel during the pandemic, even though the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advised Americans to not travel for Thanksgiving. This week, the CDC issued similar guidelines for Christmas and the rest of the holiday season, as the number of coronavirus cases and deaths continues to climb throughout the country. Danielle appeared to respond to the critics by sharing a photo of her family wearing face coverings on their way to Oklahoma. "Thankful we can actually get away safely for Thanksgiving, she wrote, adding the hashtag "be safe."

As a result, the plaintiffs contend, social media consumers don’t have legitimate choices. If they don’t like Facebook’s privacy policies, or if they want fewer ads, or are offended by Facebook’s unwillingness to face squarely the amount of disinformation on its platform, what are their options? Move to Instagram? Or WhatsApp? They are still in Facebook’s universe, which can still use their data to make oodles of money.
 Zuckerberg has apologized a dozen times or more for some Facebook missteps and promised to do better. Nothing much changes. Facebook agreed to a settlement with the FTC in 2012 over what the agency called “privacy-related violations” — and then had to pay a $5 billion fine seven years later for violating the terms of that settlement. One reason to break up Facebook is that less onerous remedies have simply failed to make a difference. Facebook has proved again and again that it doesn’t take government mandates seriously.
 As the economist Hal Singer put it in a tweet soon after the complaint was filed, “There is no injunctive or behavioral cure that can remedy this mess. Facebook’s anticompetitive conduct defies traditional (regulatory) approaches.”
 The second reason to break up Facebook is that it is the only way to create competition in the social media business — and to create it instantly. Instagram now has more than 1 billion monthly active users. WhatsApp has more than 1.6 billion. What’s more, before Facebook bought them, the two companies had much different approaches to matters such as privacy and even profitability.
 For instance, WhatsApp’s chief executive officer, Jan Koum, left Facebook in 2018 after a “clash over data,” as The Washington Post put it at the time. Koum had long kept the data of WhatsApp users private, but Zuckerberg had decided the time had come for Facebook to start monetizing it. A WhatsApp that was divorced from Facebook might well establish itself as an alternative to Facebook’s data practices. Indeed, that’s what it was before it was acquired in 2014. The same could be true of Instagram. They wouldn’t compete with Facebook on price, obviously, but on all the other things social media users care about.
 It’s no secret that government antitrust cases are difficult to win in court, where judges have heavily favored consolidation in recent decades. Facebook will argue — as it already has — that it won government approval of the deals fair and square. “Years after the FTC cleared our acquisitions, the government now wants a do-over,” the company said in a tweet.
 But reducing Facebook’s power is one of the few issues that Republicans and Democrats agree on, and as my colleague Tae Kim notes, David Cicilline, the chair of the House antitrust subcommittee, would be well served to craft a bill that would make it easier to curb the power of the big technology companies, starting with Facebook.
 As for the antitrust suits, breaking up Facebook isn’t just the right solution, it’s the only solution.

The disparity in the populations of Hernando’s wards meant that, for years, votes from those living in smaller population wards carried much more weight than their neighbors in higher population wards in Board of Aldermen elections. This means that some aldermen represented a much larger group of voters than others. For example, under the 2008 map, Ward 3 has a population of 3,293 while Ward 2 has just 982, but both wards have the same representation on the Board of Aldermen.


  The newly adopted districting plan was approved on Nov. 17 in a 4-3 vote, with the tie between the aldermen being broken by Mayor Tom Ferguson. Aldermen Gary Higdon, Michael McLendon and Doc Harris voted to approve the plan. Aldermen Andrew Miller, Jeff Hobbs and Alderwoman Cathy Brooks voted against it.


  Though the new map will be in effect for the 2021 regular elections, the old map will be used for the Jan. 19 special election to fill the Ward 1 alderman seat. The seat was previously held by Elhanan “Sonny” Bryant, who died on Saturday, Nov. 28.


  During a special meeting Monday night, the board voted unanimously to hold the special election under the ward boundaries used in the 2017 election so the constituents who elected Bryant will also choose who will serve out the remainder of his unexpired term.


  Andrew Miller, Ward 2 Alderman and the only Black board member, has said that the new districting plan violates Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which prohibits drawing election districts in ways that improperly dilute minorities’ voting power. Under the new plan, the Black voting-age population of Ward 2 will be reduced from 73.72% to 44%.


  The proportion of Black voters in Miller’s ward was much higher under the 2008 plan because its total population was less than half of what it should have been. Though the percentage of Ward 2’s electorate made up by Black voters decreased under the new plan, the number of Black voters overall increased from 547 to 755.


  “That's totally unacceptable. Steps will be taken in the near future on trying to get that resolved,” Miller said.

VICE-PRESIDENT Constantine Chiwenga has been left with egg on the face after the High Court gave nurses a green light to continue working flexible hours which the VP in his capacity as the Health minister had banned.      Chiwenga, through the Health secretary Jasper Chimedza on October 19 directed provincial medical directors to resume normal working hours for all nurses, saying the flexi working hours were creating artificial staff shortages.      However nurses objected to the decision by the Health ministry to scrap the flexible working hour system so that they could work for 40 hours a week.      In his judgement last Friday Justice Happias Zhou in case number HC7099/20 ruled that the nurses could continue working flexible hours despite the noting of an appeal by government against the initial judgment by Justice Mafusire of November 20, which reversed the termination of flexible hours by Chiwenga.      "It is hereby ordered that the application be, and is hereby granted and notwithstanding the noting of an appeal against the judgment of this Honourable Court dated 20 November, 2020 under Reference Case No. HC6507/2020, that the 1st to 3rd respondents remain barred from implementing the directive by the 3rd respondents on the 19th of October 2020," Zhou ruled.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Rahm Emanuel’s chances of landing a top Cabinet post in Joe Biden's administration appear increasingly unlikely after the former Chicago mayor emerged as a source of controversy for the president-elect, who had been considering Emanuel for transportation secretary, a person familiar with the matter told The Associated Press.
 Emanuel, among multiple candidates in the running for the Cabinet position, appeared to slip down the list in the last two weeks after progressive leaders, including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, criticized the prospect of nominating him for the post, the person said Thursday. That concern has grown deeper in recent days, particularly after the Rev. Al Sharpton raised similar concerns during a meeting with Biden and other civil rights leaders, the person said.
 The person was not authorized to publicly discuss private deliberations and spoke to the AP on the condition of anonymity.
 A decision hasn’t been finalized, and the dynamics could shift as Biden builds out his Cabinet with an eye to ensuring diverse leadership in the top ranks of his administration.
 Whether Emanuel is ultimately picked could also be affected by other factors as Biden has placed a premium on building out a Cabinet and team of senior advisers from a diverse set of backgrounds, according to people familiar with the transition’s deliberations. The dynamic, perhaps more than progressives' opposition to him, is an important factor in whether Biden eventually asks him to join the administration in a Cabinet role, according to two people familiar with deliberations who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
 An announcement on transportation secretary is not believed to be imminent.

County officials said they cannot take action against the clubs while the injunction is in place even though there is a new stay-at-home order. But if Wohlfeil fails to lift it at a hearing next week, then supervisors will appeal.
 The clubs sued the county in October after officials ordered them to close, saying live entertainment was not allowed under the public health order. Pacers received its cease-and-desist letter a few days after San Diego Padres outfielder Tommy Pham was stabbed in the club’s parking lot.
 The clubs say they are operating safely by keeping dancers six feet or more apart and requiring everyone wear masks.
 County officials said that's not enough to comply with the new stay-at-home order, which bars social gatherings.
 “I’m guessing most folks aren’t going there with all the members of their household, so you have multiple households interacting together in a high-risk setting and so we ordered them closed," Supervisor Nathan Fletcher told reporters Wednesday.
 Jason Saccuzzo, the lawyer representing Pacers, said its safety measures exceed those recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention by separating performers and audience members at least 15 feet (4.6 meters) apart. He said he knows of no coronavirus case being linked to either strip club.

The families from Baghlan and Kabul fled the violence in their native Afghanistan. They have traveled for more than a year along with six small children who now range in age from 3 to 11.
 Their minds set on reaching Germany and starting a new life there, the families on Wednesday set off from the northwestern Bosnian town of Velika Kladusa toward Croatia, pausing overnight in the pitch black and cold weather, their faces lit up by a small fire as they had their supper before moving into a tent to sleep.
 In the morning, the men carried the small children as they climbed up steep and slippery forest routes before reaching their destination, tired but smiling and hopeful.
 The Afghan families were lucky that the weather was dry although it was foggy and cold. With no Croatian police in sight, they moved into the country and on toward Italy.
 Only a few weeks ago, other migrants in makeshift tent settlements in Bosnia woke up to the season's first snow, heralding the upcoming winter. Many also allegedly face pushbacks and violence at the hands of Croatia's police.
 The EU in its statement urged Bosnia's authorities to relocate migrants to EU- funded facilities for the winter and open new ones.
 “The humanitarian crisis is becoming a reality because of the lack of action of the authorities of Bosnia and Herzegovina,” the statement said. “Solutions exist and the EU is ready to support Bosnia and Herzegovina in the necessary actions.”

Early in the second half of the De Soto High School girls basketball team’s game at Coulee Christian on Tuesday night, Pirates senior April Haakenson anticipated a pass and came away with a steal.


  The outlet went to junior guard Jenna Gianoli, who turned up the court, took one dribble and lobbed the ball ahead to senior guard Brooke Lockington, who was racing toward the basket. Lockington stopped at the block and gave a simple bounce pass back to a trailing Gianoli for an easy layup.


  The sequence wasn’t particularly flashy, but it highlights what fourth-year coach Kevin Conley wants to see from his De Soto team — stout defense, efficiency in transition and, perhaps most importantly, selflessness.

He said patients are becoming stranded in the emergency room for hours while they await beds on the main floor or transfers to larger hospitals. And those transfers are becoming more challenging, with some patients sent as far away as Denver, 400 miles (644 kilometers) from the two hospitals.
 “That is a huge burden for families and EMS systems as well when you take an ambulance and send it 400 miles one way, that ambulance is out of the community for essentially a whole day,” he said.
 Smith added that some patients have gone from thinking “I thought this was a hoax” to "Wow, this is real and I feel terrible." But he also has seen people with COVID-19 who "continue to be disbelievers. It is hard to see that."
 “At the end of the day the virus doesn’t care whether you believe in it or not," he said.

 KINSHASA, Dec 10 (Reuters) - The Democratic Republic of Congo's lower house of Parliament voted on Thursday to remove its speaker, handing President Felix Tshisekedi a major victory in a power struggle with his predecessor and coalition partner Joseph Kabila.
 The vote was a show of strength by Tshisekedi's allies, who might have enough support to form a new majority in Parliament and bring down the prime minister's government, which is dominated by Kabila loyalists.
 The National Assembly voted by 281 to 200 to impeach speaker Jeanine Mabunda, a close Kabila ally, accusing her of "conflictual and partisan" leadership and not being transparent about her management of the body's finances.
 During a rowdy debate that lasted hours, Mabunda denied the accusations against her and apologised for any misunderstandings.
 Cheers, hugs and dancing broke out among lawmakers when it was clear the motion had passed, before the count was complete.
 "With this change of majority, no one will be able to take our political class hostage," Peter Kazadi, a lawmaker from Tshisekedi's CACH political family, said on Twitter.
 Tshisekedi was a longtime opponent of Kabila, who governed from 2001 to January 2019. He won office by defeating Kabila's chosen successor in the 2018 election, even as independent observers, including Catholic bishops, said another opposition candidate had won.
 But Kabila's Common Front for Congo (FCC) won parliamentary majorities in the same election with over 60% of the seats, forcing Tshisekedi to enter into a coalition with it.
 The awkward arrangement has frustrated Tshisekedi as he tries to pursue an agenda that includes addressing armed violence in the mineral-rich east, reforming the judiciary and securing financial support from the International Monetary Fund and World Bank.
 After nearly two years of trying to chip away at Kabila's power, Tshisekedi initiated talks last month with political, religious and civil society leaders. On Sunday, he announced he would move to end the coalition with the FCC.
 Creating a new parliamentary majority could face legal hurdles, although Tshisekedi may be able to flex his increased influence on the constitutional court since appointing three judges in October.
 "It's obviously a big moment because the FCC is on the ropes," said Sarah Wolters, senior research fellow at the South African Institute of International Affairs.
 "We fought the good fight and we lost!" said Steve Mbikayi, a member of the FCC. "We will fight to get back on track." (Reporting by Stanis Bujakera; Writing by Aaron Ross and Hereward Holland Editing by Leslie Adler and Marguerita Choy)

PASADENA, Calif. (AP) — A newly launched European-U.S. satellite designed to continue a decades-long record of tracking global sea levels has sent back its first measurements, NASA said Thursday.
 The Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich satellite was launched Nov. 21 from Vandenberg Air Force Base, California and controllers spent several weeks activating instruments and making sure operations were normal.
 The first measurements provided information on sea surface height, wave height and wind speed off the southern tip of Africa.
 Josh Willis, project scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said in a statement that “the data look fantastic.”
 Named for a late NASA official who had a key role in developing space-based oceanography, the satellite’s main instrument is an extremely accurate radar altimeter that bounces energy off the sea surface.
 Space-based sea level measurements have been uninterrupted since the 1992 launch of the U.S.-French TOPEX-Poseidon satellite.

The UW football program will continue its pause of all team-related activities and will not practice for a second consecutive day due to an increase of positive COVID-19 tests within its program, a university release stated Thursday. The status of Saturday's rivalry game at Oregon remains undetermined.


  On Wednesday, UW reported 11 active positive COVID-19 cases within its athletics department — though a source also indicated not all 11 cases are tied to the football program.


  The Pac-12's minimum threshold requires 53 available scholarship players — including one quarterback, seven offensive linemen and four defensive linemen — to go forward with a game.


  UW previously had its amended season opener at Cal and the Apple Cup against Washington State canceled because of COVID-19 concerns tied to its opponents. The Husky baseball program also suspended its offseason workouts on Nov. 4, following positive COVID-19 cases and subsequent contact tracing.


  The winner of Saturday's game between the Huskies and Ducks would also represent the Pac-12 North in the conference title game on Dec. 18. Should the game be canceled, Washington (3-1) — which currently has a half-game lead over Oregon — would win the Pac-12 North by default. But it's unclear whether UW would be healthy enough to participate in the conference championship game.


  UW head coach Jimmy Lake's policy is not to comment on injury- or illness- related absences within his program to maintain a competitive advantage. However, following last Saturday's 31-26 loss to Stanford, redshirt junior wide receiver Ty Jones acknowledged that “it’s tough when we got guys coming out (of the lineup) due to coronavirus.”

ZANU-PF will descend heavily on party members found to have had a hand in the chaotic scenes which marred its weekend district co-ordinating committee (DCC) elections.      The former liberation movement party also said yesterday that it would order re-runs in some districts where it would be proven that there had been irregularities, including rigging and ballot fraud - as alleged by some irate members. As a result, the ruling party shelved the announcement of the DCC results yesterday, to allow for thorough verifications in light of the deluge of complaints by disaffected members.      This comes after the DCC elections were sullied by allegations of cheating and rigging, with heavy rains also affecting polling in some districts - while logistical challenges also led to the late delivery of ballot papers. Addressing the media in Harare yesterday, Zanu-PF chairperson Oppah Muchinguri-Kashiri warned that disciplinary action would be taken against candidates and members implicated in violations of the party's electoral guidelines.      "We are, however, fully aware that there are areas where some individuals may have chosen to act contrary to the rules and guidelines that were given. "In such cases, thorough investigations will be conducted and should there be clear and irrefutable evidence of manipulation of systems or rules, it must be made very clear that the national command centre may recommend re-runs to make sure that the will and wishes of the party members are respected," she said.      "Any malcontents who have orchestrated such indiscipline and brought the name of the party into disrepute will be held accountable. We shall want clear and explicit adherence to the rules as far as possible.      "As chairman, I must hasten to say that we are a democratic party and we expect all our members at all levels to abandon behaviour that is contrary to our democratic principles and our desire to build a strong internal democratic culture that is underpinned by high levels of discipline," Muchinguri-Kashiri said further.      She also admitted that there had been glaring poll irregularities in Manicaland, Mashonaland East and Mashonaland West.      "In Manicaland province, we note that some challenges were reported in Nyanga, Mutare Urban, Makoni, Chipinge and Chimanimani. "The same applies to Mashonaland East in Goromonzi, Mudzi and Marondera districts and Mashonaland West in Kadoma District. However, remedial action has since been taken to deal with these issues.      "The national command centre will officially announce the results as soon as they are validated … We will update our constituencies on the final results as soon as the process concludes," Muchinguri-Kashiri added.      Last week, the former liberation movement also warned that it would not hesitate to expel anyone found guilty of indiscipline.      "I want to warn any of our members … that we are watching any acts of indiscipline that bring the party into disrepute.      "Acts of indiscipline will be reported to our national disciplinary committee which will descend with a sledge hammer on anyone who is convicted of perpetrating any acts of violence which disrupt the electoral process.   "As who shall be eligible to vote in these elections, we are going to be using our party register of party districts as it was in 2017 and obviously updated.      "Results will be displayed outside every polling station as the party continues to entrench and expand its internal democracy and participatory democracy.      "I am saying this to allay any fear of rigging," Zanu-PF acting spokesperson Patrick Chinamasa said ahead of the weekend's internal party polls. This comes as the mayhem in Zaka, Masvingo province, has since seen contestants demanding that the party deals expeditiously with allegations of serious electoral malpractices.

Updates with more on Biden's selection of Rice)
 By Simon Lewis
 WILMINGTON, Del., Dec 10 (Reuters) - U.S. President-elect Joe Biden tapped Susan Rice, a former national security adviser with significant foreign policy expertise, for a domestic policy brief on Thursday, putting an emphasis on managerial experience in his new administration.
 A flurry of senior appointments underscored the former U.S. vice president's commitment to a diverse administration while rewarding longtime loyalists and veterans like himself of President Barack Obama's eight years in office.
 Biden's selection of Rice, 56, as his top domestic policy adviser and director of his Domestic Policy Council came as a surprise given her extensive background in foreign affairs. Besides her role as Obama's national security adviser, she earlier served as his ambassador to the United Nations. A Black woman, she had been a contender to be Biden's running mate.
 A source familiar with Biden's thinking said the president-elect does not view foreign policy and domestic policy as separate realms, and believes experience in one is relevant to the other.
 Due to take office on Jan. 20, Biden felt Rice's experience operating across federal government agencies would enable her to implement his policy agenda, including plans to rebuild an economy ravaged by the coronavirus, the source said.
 Rice had been under consideration for Biden's secretary of state, but she likely would have faced fierce opposition from Republicans in Congress over her role in a controversy over the deadly 2012 attack on the U.S. mission in Benghazi, Libya.
 The White House domestic policy post does not require U.S. Senate confirmation. Biden ultimately chose longtime adviser Antony Blinken to head the State Department.
 For other positions, Biden selected former Iowa Governor Tom Vilsack to serve a second tenure as agriculture secretary, Obama White House aide Denis McDonough as secretary of Veterans Affairs, U.S. Representative Marcia Fudge to head the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and Katherine Tai as U.S. Trade Representative, his transition team said in a statement.
 FAMILIAR FACES
 Biden plans to introduce his latest slate of appointees on Friday in Delaware.
 Transition spokesman Sean Savett said in a statement the picks were "forward- thinking, crisis-tested and experienced" and "ready to quickly use the levers of government to make meaningful differences in the lives of Americans and help govern on day one."
 McDonough, 51, was a longtime national security aide to Obama prior to his stint as chief of staff during Obama's second term, where he worked closely with Biden.
 But he has never served in the armed forces, and his selection caught some advocates for veterans off guard.
 Joe Chenelly, executive director of American Veterans, which has more than 250,000 members and is known as AMVETS, said people from Biden's office reached out to him on Thursday to say that McDonough understands how the VA operates.
 "They keep using the term 'pulling the levers of government,'" Chenelly said, saying he was hopeful McDonough could improve coordination between the VA and the rest of the administration.
 Vilsack, 69, served as USDA secretary under Obama for eight years and as Iowa governor from 1999 to 2007. He is seen by establishment Democrats as a sound choice, largely because of his moderate politics and relationships with large- scale farmers.
 His congressional confirmation is expected to face headwinds from progressive Democrats. Critics argue Vilsack is cozy with corporate agribusiness and top lobbying groups such as the American Farm Bureau Federation and the U.S. Dairy Export Council, where he is currently the chief executive officer. He had been a staunch early backer of Biden's presidential bid.
 Fudge, 68, is a congresswoman from Cleveland who has served in the U.S. House of Representatives since 2008. If confirmed, she would be the second Black woman to lead HUD, which focuses on federal policy surrounding housing. She is a close ally of Representative James Clyburn, whose endorsement of Biden in February served as a turning point in his bid for the Democratic presidential nomination.
 Tai, 45, a Chinese American who serves as the chief trade lawyer on the House Ways and Means Committee, played a key role in negotiating stronger labor provisions with the Trump administration in the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada (USMCA) trade deal. She would be the first woman of color to serve as trade representative.

Another rivalry game is gone.


  A day after Washington (3-1) paused all team-related football activities due to an increase in positive COVID-19 cases within its program, Saturday's game at Oregon has been canceled and declared a no contest.


  The Pac-12's minimum threshold requires each team to have 53 available scholarship players — including one quarterback, seven offensive linemen and four defensive linemen — for a game to go on. According to a source inside the program, the Huskies were "well below" the 53-scholarship minimum.


  "I'm so disappointed for everyone involved here," UW athletics director Jen Cohen said in a statement. "Every year our student-athletes, coaches, staff and Husky Nation circle this game on our calendar and so look forward to this amazing rivalry. The student-athletes from both schools have worked so hard, and I'm just really disheartened we are this point where we are unable to play due to our COVID-19 positives within the program.


  "But we will always put the health and well-being of our students, coaches and staff as our greatest priority when making decisions. We will continue to work in collaboration with our medical professionals as they advise us on how to best move forward."


  On Wednesday evening, UW reported 11 active positive COVID-19 within its athletics department — six more than a week ago. However, a source also indicated not all 11 cases can be traced to the football program. It’s university policy not to specify how many cases are tied to each team.


  Since UW athletes began returning to practice on June 15, 559 athletes have received a total of 5,950 PCR tests — with 64 positive cases (1.07%).     *[FT]: Financial Times

Someone open and accessible, willing to lead with radical transparency and demand the same of a district that’s often been slow to share information. She or he must continue mending relationships with business and philanthropy and embrace a city that demands and deserves peerless public schools.
 During the search, school board members can model that transparency by engaging families, area business and community organizations in deep discussion about the district's shortcomings, then follow through with a job description and search that honors those opinions.
 Perhaps most important, school board directors must respect their own roles and limitations as volunteer board members charged with setting the district's overall direction, not nit-picking individual decisions. Critics point out that Seattle voters' tendency to elect school board members based on ideology, rather than experience, has contributed to strained board-superintendent relationships in recent years.
 No superintendent can successfully lead institutional change without the support of a well-informed and highly functioning board. Recent school boards' failure on those fronts have helped keep the revolving door of superintendents spinning and stalled progress in eliminating inequities. If board members can't get it right this time, dramatic interventions in district governance might be in order. In the past, some leaders have talked about giving City Hall more oversight of the district, but the city is fighting its own battles. Perhaps there is another solution.
 This must be the last ride on this frustrating merry-go-round.

Tragedy struck a couple in Mtapa, Gweru, when their daughter, a Grade 7 pupil, died on the spot after she was allegedly struck by a mental patient with a stone on the left ear while on her way from school.      The 12-year-old girl, Natasha Manunure, eye witnesses said, was struck with a big stone just a few metres away from her home in Section 3, Maliwa Road also in Mtapa suburb.      She was returning home from Sandara Primary School and was walking along Nyonizonke Road while concentrating on an Agriculture Paper 1 question paper she was holding. Grade 7 pupils are writing that paper today.      The person who allegedly struck her with a stone is a well-known mental patient called Derick who stays at Mtapa Cemetery.      When a news crew arrived at the scene at around 3PM, residents had thronged the area with the police and Natasha's parents working on removing her body from the road before taking it to Gweru Provincial Hospital mortuary.      An eyewitness, Mr Sydlen Chimalizeni, who resides at a house close to where the incident occured, said he heard a noise which sounded like a firecracker followed by a sharp scream before he went out to investigate. He said he saw Natasha lying on the ground groaning in pain.      Mr Chimalizeni said from a distance, he saw Derick running from the scene.      "I knelt down intending to perform first aid on the girl but before I knew it, some white foam started coming out of her mouth. There was a lot of blood all over the scene," he said.      Mr Chimalizeni said Derick was allegedly a mental patient who was notorious for assaulting and pelting with stones, girls and women in Mtapa and Mambo suburbs.

While the Pacers remain hopeful Warren will be healthy enough to start the season opener Dec. 23 against the New York Knicks, he almost certainly will miss some or all of Indiana’s three preseason games. And when Warren does return, the Pacers could limit his playing time.
 Last season, two-time All-Star Victor Oladipo missed the first 3 1/2 months as he recovered from a ruptured quad tendon in his right knee. Oladipo said he's completely healthy this year.
 “I would say it’s night and day," Oladipo said last week. “I feel a lot better, a lot stronger. There’s always room for improvement. But I feel better now, even since the bubble. I feel like I’ve made some pretty drastic improvements, I ’ve just got to keep trending forward."
 Sabonis also said he's ready to play though the Pacers may play it safe with him, too.

NEW YORK (AP) — New York Jets rookie wide receiver Denzel Mims is dealing with a family matter and will miss the game Sunday at Seattle.


  Mims left the team Wednesday to travel home to Texas to handle the situation and was not yet back Thursday.


  Coach Adam Gase ruled Mims out against the Seahawks because the receiver would not be able to go through the NFL's COVID-19 protocols in time when he returned to play Sunday. The second-round draft pick missed the first six games while recovering from hamstring issues, but has 19 catches for 324 yards in the six games since.


  “Obviously, he's been trending in the right direction and he's been a big reason why we've had some better games since he's been playing,” Gase said. “Protocols are what they are, and he had to handle family business — which we support because we felt that was the right thing for him to do.”


  The winless Jets have Jamison Crowder, Breshad Perriman, Braxton Berrios, Jeff Smith and Vyncint Smith on the active roster at the receiver position. But there are suddenly some injury concerns — something that plagued the group early this season.


  Perriman was limited at practice Thursday with a shoulder injury, and Crowder showed up on the injury report with a calf issue that also left him limited. It occurred during practice, so how the calf responds Friday will be key to determining his availability for Sunday.

 He also noted that government officials are entitled to assert a qualified immunity defense when sued in their individual capacities, if they can show that they did not violate clearly established law.
 The court has been protective of individual rights under RFRA in recent years; it often unites conservative religious organizations and liberal civil rights groups.
 The Becket Fund for Religious Liberty filed an amicus brief in the case, and said the ruling was important because government officials often try to get rid of lawsuits by simply stopping the alleged illegal behavior.
 "We're glad the Supreme Court unanimously emphasized that the government can't expect to be let off the hook by simply changing its tune at the last second," senior counsel Lori Windham said.

If all goes as planned, Murry Bartow will return to Freedom Hall on Saturday.


  Bartow, the former East Tennessee State basketball coach who led the Bucs to three NCAA appearances, will be back working radio for UAB as ETSU plays host to the Blazers.


  In normal times, Bartow could have expected a warm welcome from the fans at Freedom Hall. But these times are anything but normal and Bartow won’t be getting any welcome at all, at least not at the game.


  With no fans allowed in Freedom Hall — if the game is even played — Bartow will likely arrive to little or no fanfare. The game is ETSU’s home opener and will be played in front of empty seats after the university announced this week that no spectators will be admitted to any ETSU athletic events until further notice.


  The Bucs’ last game was called off because of two positive coronavirus tests. The fate of Saturday’s game (4 p.m. tipoff) depended on ETSU’s latest round of coronavirus testing and the university announced Thursday that the game was still on.


  In 13 years at the helm at ETSU, Bartow won 224 games and was chosen as the coach of the year in the Southern Conference in 2004 and the Atlantic Sun in 2007. After the 2014-15 season, he was replaced by Steve Forbes.


  Since leaving ETSU, Bartow has spent time as an assistant at South Florida and UCLA, and he served as interim head coach at both places as well.


  As might be expected, the NCAA appearances with the Bucs stand out in Bartow’s mind.


  “Those are great memories,” he said. “It’s not easy getting there. There’s guys that are in mid-major type leagues that have to win that darn conference tournament, and they’ve been in coaching 20 years and never had the good fortune to win one of those tournaments. We had some really good players. I still keep in touch with a lot of those players.”


  The Bartow connection with UAB runs deep. His father, Gene, began the basketball program and served as its first head coach. Murry played at UAB and also served as an assistant and head coach at the school.


  David Crane is UAB’s usual play-by-play man. However, he also does football, and the Blazers have a game Saturday so he might not be in town. Bartow, the color commentator, did UAB radio last year as well and has dabbled in television.


  “I’m enjoying it,” Bartow said. “David is really a good play-by-play guy and enjoyable to work with. You’re pretty smart when you’re on the radio. You really make a lot of smart calls.”


  Bartow says he’d love to put those calls to the ultimate test again with another shot at coaching, but for the time being he’s having fun with the radio gig.


  “This isn’t what I want to do the next 15 years of my life, but right now it’s enjoyable,” he said. “It could be coaching or possibly transitioning into something administratively. I’m also in the process of trying to start a faith-driven foundation and hopefully do some good for kids here in Birmingham through basketball. I’m working on that too while trying to figure out what the next step is, whether it be hopefully in coaching or possibly in administration, so we’ll see. But, you know, life is good and family is good and our health, knock on wood, is good. So everything’s good right now.”


  That being said, Bartow says he misses everything about coaching.


  “When you’ve been part of a team for as long as I have and then you’re sitting here like I am and you’re really not part of a team, it’s very strange,” he said. “It’s just that I’ve been part of a team, whether it’s as a player, as an assistant coach or a head coach, for 39 out of the last 42 years. I miss it. I love practice and I miss the relationships with the players and just everything that goes into coaching.”


  Bartow and his wife, Tammy, still visit Johnson City quite a bit. Two of their sons are still in town and their grandchildren live here as well.


  “I still stay in touch with some people there in Johnson City,” Bartow said. “Tammy and I lived there 13 years and we’ve got great memories. My closest relationship is still my good friend and my former boss Dave Mullins. I’ve still got some great memories and some good friendships that remain from our days there.”


  With Saturday’s game — and almost everything else about college basketball — facing a degree of uncertainty, Bartow is sure about one thing this weekend, whether there’s a game or not.


  “I’m going to be in Johnson City either way because I’m going to see my grandkids,” he said.

THE chaos that has been the hallmark of Zanu-PF district co-ordinating committee (DCC) elections continued yesterday in different parts of the country with re-runs and failure to produce results, while in some areas ballots were found thrown in bins amid suspicions of massive vote rigging.      Zanu-PF party chairperson Oppah Muchinguri-Kashiri yesterday said the party will order re-runs in some areas due to the chaos.      Due to the volatile nature of the DCC elections, polling stations had to be guarded by members of the Zimbabwe Republic Police, which the party however said they were not going to pay them.      "The police were there to maintain peace and order, and this is not a service that is open only to Zanu-PF but to every organization across the board when they have their activities and need police presence," Muchinguri-Kashiri said.      However, police normally charge per hour when they provide security details for private functions.      In Muzarabani North, results of the elections started trickling in yesterday, and Muzarabani North MP who is also the Energy Minister Soda Zhemu landed the chairmanship post.      Deputy Finance minister and Zaka East MP Clemence Chiduwa was voted chairperson for the Zaka district with 3 582 votes to his opponent, whose name was only given as Chitara, managed 300 votes.      Another MP Davison Svuure (Zaka Central) landed the vice chairmanship post after polling 1 988 votes, while his close contender Paradzai Chakona garnered 1 291 votes.      However, in Mutare the DCC elections were so chaotic that some original ballot papers were found thrown in bins, which raised fears of rigging.      NewsDay is reliably informed that the ballot papers that were thrown into bins were found at First Class Academy School in Sakubva ward 3. A police report was then made.      Four candidates namely, Binali Yard, Clever Muparutsa, Ivan Mbengo and Cecilia Gambe are eyeing the Mutare DCC chairmanship.      One of the candidates who spoke to NewsDay on condition of anonymity said: "There is now a deliberate plot to delay the process and to frustrate my supporters so that they do not cast their votes. Just imagine we found used original ballot papers at First Class Academy in ward 3 thrown in various bins, this is rigging."      The elections have now spilled into the third day in Mutare and yet some centres in Chikanga have not yet received ballot papers.

 KINSHASA, Dec 10 (Reuters) - The Democratic Republic of Congo's lower house of Parliament voted on Thursday to remove its speaker, handing President Felix Tshisekedi a major victory in his power struggle with predecessor Joseph Kabila.
 The vote was a show of strength by Tshisekedi's allies, who might have enough support to form a new majority in Parliament and bring down the prime minister's government, which is dominated by Kabila loyalists.
 The National Assembly voted by 281 to 200 to impeach speaker Jeanine Mabunda, a close Kabila ally, accusing her of "conflictual and partisan" leadership and not being transparent about her management of the body's finances.
 During a rowdy debate that lasted hours, Mabunda denied the accusations against her and apologised for any misunderstandings.
 Cheers, hugs and dancing broke out among lawmakers when it was clear the motion had passed, before the count was complete.
 Tshisekedi was a longtime opponent of Kabila, who governed from 2001 to January 2019. He won office by defeating Kabila's chosen successor in the 2018 election, even as independent observers, including Catholic bishops, said another opposition candidate had won.
 But Kabila's Common Front for Congo (FCC) won parliamentary majorities in the same election with over 60% of the seats, forcing Tshisekedi to enter into a coalition with it.
 The awkward arrangement has frustrated Tshisekedi as he tries to pursue an agenda that includes addressing armed violence in the mineral-rich east, reforming the judiciary and securing financial support from the International Monetary Fund and World Bank.
 After nearly two years of trying to chip away at Kabila's power, Tshisekedi initiated talks last month with political, religious and civil society leaders. On Sunday, he announced he would move to end the coalition with the FCC.
 Creating a new parliamentary majority could face legal hurdles, although Tshisekedi may be able to flex his increased influence on the constitutional court since appointing three judges in October.
 "It's obviously a big moment because the FCC is on the ropes," said Sarah Wolters, senior research fellow at the South African Institute of International Affairs. "It means that there's been a gradual change in the balance of power."
 Before the vote, the Unified Lumumbist Party (PALU), which has long been allied with Kabila and has more than a dozen seats in parliament, became the latest party to announce it would join Tshisekedi's "Sacred Union".

THE Supreme Court has dismissed an appeal by Air Zimbabwe challenging a ruling by the Labour Court ordering it to reinstate over 300 workers whose contracts were unlawfully terminated without notice back in 2015.      The Labour Court had given Air Zimbabwe (Pvt) Ltd a 60-day ultimatum to either reinstate or pay damages to 300 workers whose contracts were unlawfully terminated on three months' notice in 2015.      In 2017, Labour Court judge, Emilia Muchawa found that although Air Zimbabwe (Airzim) ended the contracts in the spirit of the infamous Zuva Petroleum judgment of July 17, 2015, Section 24 of the Finance Act Number 8 of 2015, gave retrospective effect to the Labour Amendment Act, Number 5 of 2015.      This followed an application by the aggrieved workers who collectively lodged a complaint of unfair dismissal with the Labour Court.      Unhappy with the Labour Court ruling, Air Zimbabwe took the matter to the Supreme Court saying the court had misfired.      But judges Paddington Garwe, Susan Mavangira and Lewis Mathonsi dismissed Air Zimbabwe's appeal with costs saying it was misplaced.      "At the end of the day, therefore, the order granted by the court aquo was one within contemplation of the labour officer, the amendment having been made merely to ensure that the confirmed order accorded with the dictates of the law.      "I am of the considered view in light of the above sentiments that the changes effected by the Labour Court were indeed amendments and that they cannot by any stretch of imagination, be termed a substitution," said Garwe in his judgement.      "As noted earlier in this judgement, labour officers are often lay persons with little or no experience in matter legal."      He said for that reason, they are given the power to make draft rulings which are then subjected to scrutiny by the Labour Court specialised in matters of labour and employment.

An electric streetcar heads south in the 100 block of North Fourth Street, then a two-way street, in this snapshot taken in March 1941. Streetcar service in La Crosse ended 70 years ago, Nov. 11, 1945, bringing to a close a mode of transportation that began here in 1879 with horse-drawn cars followed by the advent of electric cars in 1893. Buildings of note in this photo, all which have since been razed, are the National Bank of La Crosse with its Greek temple look, the five-story Stoddard Hotel and the post office with its signature tower. The date of this photo was determined by the Rivoli Theater marquee, at left, which notes Clark Gable and Hedy Lamarr starring in “Comrade X,” a movie that appeared at the Rivoli from March 8-12, 1941, according to Tribune files.

Trump has acted to join the case, tweeting Thursday that “the Supreme Court has a chance to save our Country from the greatest Election abuse in the history of the United States.” Hours later, Trump held a meeting at the White House, scheduled before the suit was filed, with a dozen Republican attorneys general, including Paxton and several others who are backing the effort.
 Still, some of the top state Republican prosecutors urging the Supreme Court to hear the case have acknowledged that the effort is a long shot and are seeking to distance themselves from Trump’s baseless allegations of fraud. North Dakota's Wayne Stenehjem, among the 17 attorneys general supporting the case, said North Dakota is not alleging voter fraud in the four states at issue.
 “We’re careful on that,” said Stenehjem, who noted that his office has received thousands of calls and emails from constituents asking the state to support the suit. “But it’s worth it for the Supreme Court to weigh in and settle it once and for all,” he said.
 Montana Attorney General Tim Fox called the lawsuit “belated” and said its chances “are slim at best.” But Fox supported Texas because he said the case raised “important constitutional questions about the separation of powers and the integrity of mail-in ballots in those defendant states.”
 Suits brought by Trump and his allies have failed repeatedly across the country, and the Supreme Court this week rejected a Republican bid to reverse Pennsylvania’s certification of Biden’s victory.
 Trump looked straight past the high court loss, claiming it didn’t matter because his campaign wasn’t involved in the case, though it would have benefited if the case had continued. He has spent the week relentlessly tweeting about the Texas case with the hashtag “overturn” and claiming, falsely, that he had won the election but was robbed.

Duke hosted No. 9 Miami instead of the Hurricanes visiting Wake Forest, which had to pause team activities due to coronavirus issues. That led the ACC to push the Duke-FSU matchup back one week and move it to Tallahassee, Florida.


  The Blue Devils have played just three games since Halloween. The chance to get back on the field and provide the seniors another game is a motivator for Duke coach David Cutcliffe.


  “I think sweat helps,” Cutcliffe said. “It’s been a difficult time throughout the season, but they’ve answered the bell. One shot for our seniors, and that’s certainly a big part of the focus. Back to work.”


  The teams will be back to work in what could be a shootout against porous defenses. Duke has allowed 48, 56 and 56 points in its last three games. Florida State has given up 38, 41 and 48 points in its last three games.


  Some other things to watch when Florida State hosts Duke:


  HISTORY ON FLORIDA STATE’S SIDE


  Florida State has won all 20 meetings with the Blue Devils, including the Seminoles’ 45-7 win against Duke in the 2013 ACC title game on the way to winning the national championship.


  TURNOVERS


  Duke has struggled to protect the football all season. The Blue Devils have lost 19 fumbles and 16 interceptions this year. The 35 turnovers are the most in the Bowl Subdivision ranks and at least 11 more than any other FBS team.

"Americans want us to do a scientific review, but I think they also want us to make sure we're not wasting time on paperwork as opposed to going forward with the decision," FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn said before the meeting.


  A positive vote for the vaccine was virtually assured after FDA scientists issued a glowing review of the vaccine earlier in the week. Agency staffers said data from Pfizer's ongoing study of 44,000 people showed strong protection across different age groups, races and health conditions with no major, unexpected safety problems.


  The Pfizer-BioNTech shot remains experimental because that final-stage study isn't complete. As a result, the expert panel wrestled with a list of questions that have yet to be answered.


  For example, while the vaccine is more than 90% effective in blocking the symptoms of COVID-19, the FDA's advisers stressed it is not yet clear if it can stop the silent, symptomless spread that accounts for up to half of cases.


  "Even though the individual efficacy of this vaccine is very, very, very high, you really as of right now do not have any evidence" that it will lower transmission, said Dr. Patrick Moore of the University of Pittsburgh. He urged Pfizer to take additional steps to answer that question.


  And the advisers are worried that Pfizer will lose its opportunity to answer critical questions as it begins offering the real vaccine to study participants who had been getting dummy shots.


  The company proposed gradually moving those patients to the vaccine group, with priority based on age, health conditions and other factors. Under that plan, 70-year-old participants would cross over before healthy 30-year-olds.


  Pfizer must still show whether the vaccine works in children younger than 16 and in pregnant women.


  On the safety front, as widespread vaccinations begin, the first recipients will be closely tracked by government health authorities since studies in tens of thousands of people can't detect rare risks that strike 1 in a million. Hanging over the meeting were the British allergic reactions and a warning from authorities there that people with a history of serious reactions shouldn't get the vaccine for now.


  Pfizer representatives said they have seen no signs of allergic reactions in their trial. But some of the FDA advisers fear the British warning will deter millions of Americans with allergies who might benefit from the COVID-19 vaccine from giving it a try, and urged additional studies to try to settle the issue.


  "This issue is not going to die until we have better data," Offit said.

The total, it turned out, was an average of about 1,000 calories a week of compensatory eating, no matter how much people had worked out. By that math, the men and women who had burned 1,500 calories a week with exercise had clawed back all but about 500 calories a week of their expenditures, while those burning through 3,000 calories with exercise ended up with a net weekly deficit of about 2,000 calories. (No one’s overall metabolic rate changed much.)


  Unsurprisingly, the group exercising the most lost weight; the others did not.


  But that study left many questions unanswered, Flack felt. The participants had performed similar, supervised workouts, walking moderately for 30 or 60 minutes, five times a week. Would varying lengths or frequencies of workouts matter to people’s caloric compensation? And what was driving people’s eating? Did the differing amounts of exercise affect people’s appetite hormones differently?


  To find out, he and his colleagues decided to repeat much of the earlier experiment, but with novel exercise schedules this time. So, for the new study, which was published in November in Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise, they gathered another group of 44 sedentary, overweight men and women, checked their body compositions, and asked half of them to start exercising twice a week, for at least 90 minutes, until they had burned about 750 calories a session, or 1,500 for the week. They could work out however they wished — many chose to walk, but some chose other activities — and they wore a heart rate monitor to track their efforts.


  The rest of the volunteers began exercising six times a week for about 40 to 60 minutes, burning close to 500 calories a session, for a weekly total of about 3,000 a week. The researchers also drew blood, to check on the levels of certain hormones that can affect people’s appetites.


  After 12 weeks, everyone returned to the lab, where the researchers refigured body compositions, repeated the blood draws and began calculating compensations.

He said waiting for the local authority to act was problematic because residents faced the inconvenience of a virtually impassable major road every day.      "We have been reporting about this road to our local councillor (Cllr Sinikiwe Mutanda) but she is saying the council is currently financially crippled due to prevailing economic challenges. Bulawayo used to be a very beautiful place and as residents it pains us to see it in this state. We are doing this voluntarily as you can see most of the people working here are the youths who want to see their suburb return to its original state," said Mr Dladla.      He appealed to well-wishers and the corporate world to assist with gravel, quarry, cement and rubble so that residents can patch all roads that need to be repaired in the suburb.      "We are appealing for assistance from the well-wishers. We accept help of any kind especially gravel, quarry, cement and rubble.      We are also asking for food so that those who are working can eat. We are willing to do this in the whole of Entumbane but we do not have the resources. We, however, have our hands, eyes and willing hearts. We can't watch while our suburb deteriorates into a slum. We will do it ourselves," declared Mr Dladla.       One of about 15 youths who were working on the road, Mpilwenhle Dhewa, said he felt it was necessary for him to volunteer as he loves his suburb.      "I voluntarily decided to come and work here for the love of my suburb. I was born and bred here and hopefully I will die here. The road was no longer user friendly. This is the only main road that is used to gain access to Entumbane and if we watch it deteriorating like this, we would have failed as youths in the suburb. Besides, this will keep me busy and away from social ills like drugs and alcohol," he said.

Austin would make history as the first Black person to lead the Pentagon if confirmed by the Senate. Austin is a retired Army general and is the former commander of the US Central Command. He has worked closely with Biden in the past. While Biden was vice president, Austin served as the vice chief of staff of the Army and commanding general of US forces in Iraq, and later the commander of CENTCOM. Biden and Austin had discussions on a range of issues, including those in the Middle East and Central and South Asia. Austin would need a congressional waiver to be confirmed for the civilian post because federal law requires seven years of retirement from active duty before taking on the role. Austin retired from active-duty service only four years ago.

WASHINGTON (AP) — A senior manager with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told congressional investigators she was ordered to delete an email suggesting attempted political interference by the Trump administration in coronavirus reports to the public, according to a transcript released Thursday.
 Rep. James Clyburn, D-S.C., who released the partial transcript, said the testimony of Dr. Charlotte Kent raises “serious concern about what may be deliberate efforts by the Trump administration to conceal and destroy evidence that senior political appointees interfered with career officials’ response to the coronavirus crisis.” Kent testified that she believed CDC Director Robert Redfield ordered the deletion of the email.
 In a letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, Clyburn accused the administration of trying to obstruct his investigation and threatened to issue subpoenas to compel the release of documents. Clyburn chairs a special House panel empowered to broadly examine the coronavirus crisis and the government's response.
 HHS said in a statement that Clyburn's committee is “not operating in good faith” and called its portrayal of the CDC official's testimony “irresponsible.”
 HHS also released a brief statement from Redfield in which he said he had instructed agency staffers to ignore the email but did not mention ordering its deletion.
 The ranking Republican on the investigative panel, Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana, said Democrats have found “zero evidence of actual interference in CDC scientific reports.”

Rice is expected to be more of a force, both inside and outside the White House, and her appointment creates a new power center in the West Wing. She’s discussed replicating some elements of the National Security Council in her new role, including a principals committee of Cabinet secretaries and others that could bring more structure to domestic policymaking, but also pull more power into the West Wing.
 She’s expected to play an active role in the Biden administration’s response to the coronavirus pandemic. Health care, immigration and tackling racial inequality are also expected to be among the top issues for the domestic policy shop next year.
 The 56-year-old Rice will be among the most prominent Black women in Biden’s administration. Rice was also in the running to become Biden’s running mate before he picked California Sen. Kamala Harris.
 Since then, Rice has been discussing other roles with the Biden team and was initially seen as a contender for secretary of state. But as a longtime target of Republicans, her prospects for a Cabinet position faded after the election, given the close makeup of the Senate. A pair of runoffs in Georgia next month will determine which party has control, but either configuration will be exceedingly close.
 Rice’s role overseeing the council does not require Senate confirmation.
 Although Biden has insisted his administration will not simply be a retread of Obama’s presidency, he is bringing back numerous familiar faces. His team has defended the moves as a nod toward experience and the need to hit the ground running in tackling the pressing issues facing the nation across multiple fronts.

LOUISVILLE, Ky (AP) — Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear announced Thursday that the state's restaurants, bars, gyms and other businesses will be able to return to their previous capacity limits starting Monday, Dec. 14. “When we talk about COVID being a fast moving train, it doesn’t just immediately turn; you have to slow it down, stop it and turn it around. We still believe that’s what we’re seeing,” Beshear said. The Democratic governor pointed toward the state's test positivity rate as a “leading not a lagging” indicator that community spread is slowing, and urged businesses to reopen with a commitment to enforce social distancing guidelines. “We've got to enforce that mask mandate, that's the way we don't have to take steps like this again,” he added. Bars and restaurants will be able to open indoor dining at 50% capacity, and continue curbside pickup, delivery, and outdoor dining. They must stop serving food at 11 p.m. and close by midnight. Gyms, fitness centers, pools and other indoor recreation facilities will also be able to resume operations at 50% capacity. Kentucky reported 4,324 new coronavirus cases Thursday, a record-high number of cases since the pandemic began. Twenty-eight more Kentuckians have been confirmed to have died because of the virus. Roughly 1,760 are hospitalized. Beshear's school-related orders will remain in place. While middle and high schools are required to continue with remote learning until January, elementary schools were allowed to reopen on Dec. 7 if the county they were located in was not in a “red zone,” the highest category for COVID-19 incidence rates. All but one of Kentucky’s 120 counties are reported to be in the red zone. The state’s test positivity rate has lowered to 9.13%, continuing a weeklong...
