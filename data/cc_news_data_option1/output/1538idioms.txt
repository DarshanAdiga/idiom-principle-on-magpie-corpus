Debt funds faced redemptions worth over Rs 1.94 trillion in March. The largest outflow of over Rs 1.1 trillion was from the liquid fund category because companies pulled out cash to cope with lockdown pressure. Instead of selling securities at deep discounts in a bearish market, funds opted to meet redemption by borrowing from banks. As a result, many schemes are reporting net liabilities in terms of assets by end-March. Debt funds remain under the gun in April as well because redemption pressure has continued. While the Securities and Exchange Board of India allows debt funds to borrow up to 20 per cent of assets under management (AUM) to meet redemption demands, borrowings could easily cascade beyond that level. Some schemes had already borrowed over 17 per cent of AUMs to meet redemption demands by March-end. Despite surplus liquidity, yields on corporate debt have shot up. The risk is that the debt market remains braced for a significant increase in government borrowing, which will suck up resources and leave little for companies.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration and Congress are nearing an agreement as early as Sunday on an aid package of up to $450 billion to boost a small-business loan program that has run out of money and add funds for hospitals and COVID-19 testing.With small-business owners reeling during a coronavirus outbreak that has shuttered much economic activity, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he was hopeful of a deal that could pass Congress quickly and get the Small Business Administration program back up by midweek. "I think we're very close to a deal today. I'm hopeful that we can get that done," he said.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said he believed a deal could be reached late Sunday or early Monday. "We still have a few more details to deal with," he said.Under the proposed deal, the government's Paycheck Protection Program for small businesses would get roughly $300 billion, according to Mnuchin. The program has been swamped by businesses applying for loans and reached its appropriations limit last Thursday after approving nearly 1.7 million loans. That left thousands of small businesses in limbo as they sought help. An additional $50 billion in the evolving deal would go for disaster loans.About $75 billion would go to U.S. hospitals, for those straining under a ballooning coronavirus caseload as well as those struggling to stay financially afloat after suspending elective surgeries during the pandemic. About $25 billion would be added for COVID-19 testing, something states have said was urgently needed. The money for hospitals and testing were priorities sought by congressional Democrats.But additional aid to state and local governments would be left out, Mnuchin said. Democrats have been keen to boost funding to cash-strapped states and local governments whose revenues have cratered, but the issue threatened to provoke fights between large, high-tax states like California and New York and smaller states more typically run by Republicans."The president is willing to consider that in the next bill, but wants to get this over the finish line with a focus on small businesses, hospitals and testing," Mnuchin said.He said he's been in touch with GOP leaders including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., and all are "on board with the same plan.""I'm hopeful that we can reach an agreement, that the Senate can pass this tomorrow, and that the House can take it up on Tuesday, and, Wednesday, we'd be back up and running," Mnuchin said.Schumer said Democrats were still working to get aid for state and local governments. They had submitted a compromise offer Friday that would provide $150 billion for states as well as cities, counties and towns based on need. ‪Key swing states for Trump in the November presidential election — Pennsylvania, Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin — would receive billions in new aid under the proposal, according to a senior Democratic aide who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss details of private negotiations."We are pushing hard," Schumer said. "We don't want our police, our firefighters, our EMTs, our bus drivers — this is not an abstract issue. We don't want them fired."House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., predicted an agreement would be reached "soon.""I am pleased to report that we have been engaged in bipartisan negotiations on our interim legislation, and our progress is encouraging," she said in a letter late Saturday to Democratic colleagues.Republican Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, who leads the National Governors' Association, said he and other governors believe that aid for state and local government is "desperately needed,'' but that it may not be an issue worth fighting over for now."I don't think the deal is finalized yet," he said. "But, look, we do not want to hold up funding to these small businesses. And we hope that the Democrats and the Republicans in the Senate can come together in a bipartisan way and get something moving for the American people."The SBA loans, based on a company's payroll costs, offer owners forgiveness if they retain workers or rehire those who have been laid off. The law provides for forgiveness for companies in any industry — even businesses like hedge funds and law firms. There's a limit of $100,000 on the amount of employees' compensation that can be considered when loan forgiveness is calculated. While they wait, owners who are shut down or who've lost revenue have expressed unease about the longer- term impact the virus outbreak will have on their companies."There's great pain out there," said Suzanne Clark, president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. "Every hour and day that goes by without this assistance is really hurting them."Mnuchin, Schumer and Hogan appeared on CNN's "State of the Union," and Clark spoke on CBS' "Face the Nation."___Associated Press writer Andrew Taylor contributed to this report.Copyright 2020 Associated Press.

Suffice to say that historians will not refer to this crisis and America’s current captain in such terms. With each successive day, Donald Trump proves himself constitutionally incapable of such leadership. Instead of meeting the challenge, he recedes.
 If there was ever doubt as to the notion that governance matters, that is being put to rest while we pay the consequences.
 So how did we get here? How did we end up with such an underwhelming, unworthy person presiding over the country at a time of such peril?
 In a nutshell, Trump is a product of a wholly different virus, a political contagion that has been eating away at America’s political system and very functionality for a few decades. To be clear, Trump is not patient-zero. He was not there at the onset. His presidency, however, is the long-incubated culmination of it.
 There are different interpretations of how this political virus first took root. One political species traces the origins to the Robert Bork confirmation hearings and the over-the-top rhetoric of Ted Kennedy and his Democratic cohorts. The other species contends the genesis lies with the antics of Newt Gingrich and his Republican acolytes.
 For three decades or more, that’s been the story. Tit for tat…for tit for tat.
 So it has gone in an ever escalating culture of accusation and outrage concurrent with a declining respect for good faith, shared values and any spirit of compromise.
 The disease found further fuel in the drawing of legislative districts increasingly safe for one party or the other. And in this era of customized media in which information and balanced perspective often take a backseat to the high-school-like rah-rah of, “Hit ‘em again, hit ‘em again, harder, harder.”
 All of which brought us to 2016 and a weakened political organism susceptible to the appeal of Donald Trump in first managing a hostile takeover of the Republican Party before overcoming Hillary Clinton, the embodiment of consummate insiderism with a distinct eau de scandal.
 Now, four years later, a long-infected political system and an ill-prepared, ill-suited, often virulent president have met an even more dangerous threat, a real virus with global ambitions.
 So far, sadly, the results of this layering of one virus on top of another speak for themselves. The United States leads the world in the number of COVID cases, the number of associated deaths and the rate at which the virus is spreading. Those are dubious honors, doubly so in that we had far more time than China and Europe to prepare. (While acknowledging that the figures out of China and Iran may be less than fully transparent.)
 As the logical end result of our diseased political system, Donald Trump, arguably, is the worst person to have at the helm in the midst of a spreading pandemic.

Look at all the obstacles," Pacioretty told the Golden Knights' website.

They're getting their bodies ready, and you better believe everyone around the league is trying to get every advantage possible in terms of recovery and getting in whatever shape they can. Most teams go into the (Stanley Cup Playoffs) beat up, but that won't be the case this year. Guys are going to be healthy and teams are going to be able to show their true forms with pretty much every player on the roster." The NHL season, like those of all other major North American sports leagues, was halted in mid-March due to the coronavirus pandemic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            All NHL teams had between 11 and 14 regular-season games remaining when play was paused. The format to be used when and if action resumes remains uncertain. NHL deputy commissioner Bill Daly told ESPN recently that the league is listening to offers from venues around North America that are volunteering to host neutral-site playoff games. Among the sites that could host games, probably without spectators, are Grand Forks, N.D.; Manchester, N.H.; and Saskatoon, Saskatchewan.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            NHL Players Association executive director Donald Fehr, however, said Saturday that he had not yet had discussions with the league about any specifics related to neutral-site locations. Pacioretty insisted that he has no problem playing the waiting game.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            "I mean, if we had to wait six months and play in Antarctica, I'd be willing to do that," Pacioretty said. When the season was suspended, Pacioretty had a team-leading 32 goals and 66 points for the Golden Knights (39-24-8), who led a congested Pacific Division at the time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            --Field Level Media                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

If you want to go the extra mile in protecting your paint, wax and seal your car before putting it away. That'll prolong the longevity of the paint, even in the face of dust, twigs, and other contaminants.

CHEYENNE, Wyo. (AP) — Joe Biden has won Wyoming’s Democratic presidential caucus, which had been postponed for two weeks and scaled back to just mail-in ballots because of the coronavirus pandemic, state party officials said Sunday.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            The results come less than two weeks after Bernie Sanders dropped out and endorsed Biden, who is the only candidate still actively seeking the Democratic nomination. Voting began when it was still a two-candidate race.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            The Wyoming Democratic Party announced the results after tabulating votes Saturday and auditing the results overnight.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            What was originally to be a combination of in-person caucusing, drop-off and mail-in vote tabulation on April 4 was scaled back to just drop-off and mail-in — and finally just mail-in voting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Party officials then pushed back the due date for mailed ballots and tabulation to help ensure participation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            The mailed-in ballots were due at Wyoming Democratic Party headquarters Friday. Party officials used a courier to drive the ballots to Denver for tabulation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            The party for the first time used ranked-choice voting to allocate delegates to the Democratic National Convention in August. Voters could rank up to five candidates according to their preference.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Besides Biden and Sanders, Hawaii U.S. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard; former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg; former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg; Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren; Minnesota U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar; and investor Tom Steyer, of San Francisco; were on the ballot.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

"Hey, it's a really nice push mower," Briggs joked. "I've looked at getting a new mower, but that's a large expense right now for someone just starting out. We'll save that expense for down the road."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

Texas Governor Gregg Abbot is a Republican and 1000 people just showed up in Austin to protest his policies. South Carolina Governor McMaster is a Republican and there were protests there too.


  People are not protesting against Democrats as much as they're demonstrating against the growing power of government. Politicians are certainly not letting this crisis go to waste as they flex their muscles to bend citizens to their will.


  Are we supposed to believe that politicians from small-town mayors to Congress in Washington are just going to give up this power once the crisis is past? Several states are using drones to catch people failing to adhere to social distancing guidelines. I'm sure local and state politicians will think of many uses for those drones once the crisis is past.


  Right now, it's the right protesting, largely to get government out of the way and let people get back to work. But once this crisis has passed, it's likely that both left and right will find reasons to protest this aggrandizing power grab by government.


  If not, then we owe Ben Franklin an apology, who told us that we had a republic, "if you can keep it."


  Sorry, Ben. We couldn't keep it.

Quando la salute glielo permetteva era sempre presente alle partite, pronto a tifare e gioire con la squadra. Non amava tanto perdere perché di natura era un vincente.

The international market for cloud computing in education is envisioned to leverage the booming opportunities originated from the loud acceptance of upgradable cloud services in the education industry. A countable number of educational institutions have given the green light for cloud computing to meet the requirement of streamlining academic procedures such as evaluation, administration, and most importantly, learning. The global cloud computing in education market is prophesied to win lucrative perks from the demand to implement centralized systems for the purpose of effectively managing academic administration processes, thus curbing the burden on the management staff.

All the restrictions in place under the ongoing lockdown will remain in force without any change, and the relief stated in the April 17 notification for certain zones will not be available for Thane district, stated the order issued by district collector Rajesh Narvekar.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    "Consequent upon the increase in the number of COVID- 19 cases, the entire Thane district is being declared as a containment zone. "The areas classified as the containment zone include the municipal corporation limits of Thane, Navi Mumbai, Mira Bhayander, Kalyan Dombivili, Ulhasnagar, and Bhiwandi- Nizampur," it stated.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Areas under the municipal councils of Ambernath, Kulgaon Badlapur and Nagar panchayat of Shahapur and Murbad, besides the entire area of Thane Zilla Parishad will also fall under the containment zone. The number of coronavirus positive cases in Thane district rose by 19 to 394 on Sunday night with 12 deaths so far, as per district authorities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

But additional aid to state and local governments would be left out, Mnuchin said. Democrats have been keen to boost funding to cash-strapped states and local governments whose revenues have cratered, but the issue threatened to provoke fights between large, high-tax states like California and New York and smaller states more typically run by Republicans.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            “The president is willing to consider that in the next bill, but wants to get this over the finish line with a focus on small businesses, hospitals and testing,” Mnuchin said.

Schumer said Democrats were still working to get aid for state and local governments. They had submitted a compromise offer Friday that would provide $150 billion for states as well as cities, counties and towns based on need. ‪Key swing states for Trump in the November presidential election — Pennsylvania, Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin — would receive billions in new aid under the proposal, according to a senior Democratic aide who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss details of private negotiations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            “We are pushing hard,” Schumer said. “We don’t want our police, our firefighters, our EMTs, our bus drivers — this is not an abstract issue. We don’t want them fired.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

The Denver Broncos appear to be on the outside looking in if they want to select one of the top three wide receivers in this year's NFL Draft. With the No. 15 selection, there's no guarantee the Broncos can select Alabama's Jerry Jeudy or Henry Ruggs or Oklahoma's CeeDee Lamb -- but will that prompt general manager John Elway to make a move?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Per Woody Paige of The (Colorado Springs) Gazette, Elway and the Broncos are looking to trade up in the draft in order to select Jeudy -- the "big three" wideout the franchise is targeting. Sources told Paige the Broncos will try to trade up to the No. 8 or No. 10 spot and grab Jeudy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     The Arizona Cardinals are at the No. 8 spot and the Cleveland Browns currently hold the No. 10 pick. Denver could have a problem trading with Arizona, as general manager Steve Keim didn't rule out selecting a wide receiver in Round 1.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     "You want to look at the long-term contracts you have in place, whether guys can play inside or outside," Keim said. "If there is a player at the right spot, someone we are high on, we will certainly take advantage of that. I say this every year, your needs are always changing.

The Malaysians were taught a football lesson in that December 1 group match of the Southeast Asian championships and centre-back Muslim Ahmad is leading a rallying cry for revenge in Sunday's first leg of the final in Kuala Lumpur.
 "Nobody knew what hit us when we first played Indonesia. We were like headless chickens, running all over the place in disarray," he told Malaysia's _New Straits Times_.
 "We did not know what game we were playing. But after that defeat, we were determined to rise again and reaching the final is our reward. But we still (have) an unresolved matter and we want to redeem ourselves for that embarrassing defeat," the 21-year-old added.
 Muslim said the hosts would pay special attention to Indonesia's Uruguayan- born striker Cristian Gonzales and winger Oktovianus Maniani.
 "Gonzales has the physical strength to trouble us while Okto has got the speed to easily go past players. We'll have to watch out for them," the Young Tigers defender said.

Rau noted Mercy’s video visits were in the pilot stage and the global COVID-19 pandemic forced them to act quickly and mobilize it. The process moved the video visit service offerings ahead by a year from where they thought they would be.
 In about one week Mercy had to write the necessary code in their system and train medical professionals how to use their virtual appointment platform, enabling doctors to securely address medical needs.
 The process has enabled clinics in Mercy’s local network to preserve much needed personal protective equipment and limit exposure.
 From the touch of a smartphone, tablet or computer, patients can connect directly by video with nurses, physician’s assistants and doctors in having their appointments remotely.
 “Really the flow of that visit is very similar to if you were sitting in the office with the doctor,” Rau said.
 Starting with a short interview patients meet face to face with their doctor on Mercy's online platform that is tied in with MyChart, enabling healthcare providers to securely access necessary medical information.
 While some things such as documenting a person's weight have to be done verbally, the appointments themselves are much like a regular in-office visit and medical practitioners are taking notes, asking questions and going through their medical assessment in determining the needs of patients.

Beyond the development of the architecture, the deployment, management, and control of the security in a SDN environment is up for grabs. The presence of competing approaches such as it is believed that security is best embedded inside the network or it works best when embedded in storage, servers, or other devices. Irrespective of all the solutions, the architecture of SDS must be simple in order to install, manage, and retain the highly dynamic environment, be cost-effective to ensure that the security can be installed everywhere, and be secure in order to provide protection against all the advanced threats.

Telangana government on Sunday decided to extend the coronavirus lockdown in the state till May 7. "The cabinet has decided to extend the lockdown in the state till May 7. The cabinet will take stock of the situation on May 5," said Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao.                                                                                            This comes after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the extension of nationwide lockdown till May 3. Rao said the daily essentials and industries like rice mills, pharmacy companies will run as said before.                                                                                            "The government will provide ration and Rs 1,500 to migrant labourers who have families in Telangana and ration to those who stay alone," Chief Minister added. The Cabinet has approved a 10 per cent increase in gross salaries of police personnel who are working without caring for their lives.                                                                                            "If the Centre is giving any relaxation from April 20, the state cabinet has decided that no relaxation will be given in Telangana. Swiggy and Zomato will not be allowed in the state to function from tomorrow. If any delivery agent violates then action will be taken," he added. CM Rao said no owners are supposed to pressurise the renters for rent for the months of March, April and May, "the owners should give deferment to the renters and they should not collect any interest. If anyone pressurises then the renters can call the police."

The New England Patriots surprised many around the league by using their franchise tag on offensive guard Joe Thuney earlier this offseason, but depending on who comes calling before or during the 2020 NFL Draft, Thuney might not end up returning to the Patriots at all. According to ESPN's Mike Reiss, the two sides "haven't been close to an extension," and it wouldn't be out of the question for Bill Belichick and Co. to solicit trade offers for the All-Pro blocker.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Thuney's future with the Patriots "bears watching during the draft," Reiss wrote Sunday, especially because the team ranks among the bottom five in terms of current salary cap space and is set to pay Thuney $14.78 million this year. The 27-year-old lineman "holds notable leverage" in contract talks because of his high cap figure, Reiss added, so "if a guard-needy team is willing to deal a second- or high third-rounder to help fill in the Patriots' draft board, that would have to be something Belichick seriously considers."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    New England, remember, is already operating without a 2020 second-round pick after trading its selection to the Cincinnati Bengals for wide receiver Mohamed Sanu during the 2019 season. The Patriots are also one of the most active teams in recent memory when it comes to dealing picks and players during the draft.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

"What does this graph illustrate is the amazing work of the American people to really adhere to social distancing. This was nothing we had ever attempted to do as a nation, and the world hadn’t attempted to do. But they were able to decrease the number of cases so that in general, most of the metro areas never had an issue of complete crisis care of all of their hospitals in a region. So you can see our case fatality rate is about half to a third of many of the other countries."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

I’m hopeful that we can get that done,” he said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said he believed a deal could be reached late Sunday or early Monday. “We still have a few more details to deal with,” he said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Under the proposed deal, the government’s Paycheck Protection Program for small businesses would get roughly $300 billion, according to Mnuchin. The program has been swamped by businesses applying for loans and reached its appropriations limit last Thursday after approving nearly 1.7 million loans. That left thousands of small businesses in limbo as they sought help. An additional $50 billion in the evolving deal would go for disaster loans.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            About $75 billion would go to U.S. hospitals, for those straining under a ballooning coronavirus caseload as well as those struggling to stay financially afloat after suspending elective surgeries during the pandemic. About $25 billion would be added for COVID-19 testing, something states have said was urgently needed. The money for hospitals and testing were priorities sought by congressional Democrats.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

With the help of his wife, a social media manager for several local small businesses and a "marketing expert," they also figured they could get the service up and running within in a week's time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

Roseburg Public Library remains closed for the foreseeable future, and that has been quite an adjustment for us. Since the library opened in December 2018, more than 400 people visited every day, and we miss the interactions, whether it was helping with technology questions, connecting at storytime or talking books.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Even though the doors are locked and we see patrons only once a week, library staff remains committed to public service. Youth Services Librarian Aurora Oberg, Circulation Supervisor Liz Hendershott, RARE (Resource Assistance for Rural Environments) AmeriCorps Participant Katie Fischer and I juggle several projects and tasks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Drive-up service for patrons to pick up physical items continues every Thursday from 3-6 p.m. Behind the scenes, that means we handle the book drop following professional recommendations regarding disinfection of circulating materials. We pull books from the shelves and prepare them for pickup. On Thursdays, we check out all requested materials and facilitate their transfer to patrons’ vehicles. In the first three weeks, we provided items to 126 drivers.

WASHINGTON – Mesa business owner Savannah Sanders said it felt like getting “a bomb dropped on you." Shortly after being approved for a loan to keep her business afloat, the bank said the federal Paycheck Protection Program was out of money. Now Sanders, like business owners across the country, are on edge as Congress was wrangling over the weekend regarding plans to add billions more to the original $349 billion in the PPP, administered through the U.S. Small Business Administration.

As the government scrambles to get a grip on the spiralling PPE situation, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has appointed former Olympics chief Lord Deighton as a 'personal protective tsar' to shore up supplies.

A six-foot tall, bubble-gum pink unicorn with a rainbow tail was spotted dancing around Pratt on Thursday, April 9, bringing smiles to residents of Hillside Terrace and Pratt Rehabilitation and Residence Center and was also spotted at Pratt Health and Rehab on April 8.


   


  "With social distancing in place, we wanted to bring some joy and laughter and a little bit of silliness to residents who aren't getting out to see anybody right now and who can't have visitors," said Iuka resident Kasey Voss. "Anything to bring a laugh right now."


   


  Voss, who is the Pratt liaison for Wichita-based Heartland Home Health and Hospice, said the idea came to her as she considered ways to bring some fun into the drab days of COVID-19 confinement.


   


  "I had ordered the inflatable unicorn outfit from Amazon for a friend's daughter's birthday," Voss said. "This sparked my imagination."


   


  Voss was assisted with the production by Heartland Home Health Care nurses Brittany Mead, Tammy Krom and Kelsey Williams, all residents of Pratt.


   


  "Getting into the costume is tricky," Voss said.


   


  "I'm short, so when I'm inside and it's been inflated, I only reach to the neck, where there's a small peephole for me to look out," Voss said.


   


  One of her assistants played recorded music as Voss pranced to the beat.


   


  Voss's dancing unicorn act also captured the attention of KWCH Channel 12 Wichita news staff with a segment aired on Wednesday, April 15.


   


  Ironically, Voss said, since it was not planned, two the unicorn dance performances happened to fall on National Unicorn Day, which is celebrated annually on April 9.


   


  Still posted on the Wichita-based Heartland Home Health and Hospice Facebook site and also on Voss's Facebook site, the prancing Pink Unicorn never tires of bopping to the beat.

With so many anime crowding the Isekai genre these days, only a few are creative enough to be different from the regular fare. 'Ascendance of a Bookworm' happens to be a huge variation from what most Isekai anime shows have to offer.

NEW YORK (AP) — As Americans stockpile everything from canned soup to toilet paper, food and consumer products makers are scrambling to meet demand. Companies like Clorox Co. and J.M. Smucker Co. are running their manufacturing plants 24/7 while reducing their product lines so they can get the products into stores faster. They're also under pressure to protect their workers who're on the front lines of the coronavirus. The Associated Press recently interviewed Geoff Freeman, the CEO of the Consumer Brands Association — formerly the Grocery Manufacturers Association — on a range of issues including the current status of supplies, protections for workers and customers' shift away from organic food to packaged items like mac and cheese. Questions and answers have been edited for length and clarity. Q. How does the industry's supply chain brace for a pandemic? A. I'm not sure that any of us would have been prepared for something we have never seen in our lifetimes, frankly our grandparents didn’t see in their lifetimes. It isn’t much a playbook to dust off as there is a put your head down, rise to the occasion and do everything you can do, and this industry has done just that. Q. Are you seeing consumers' stockpiling leveling off a bit? A. We're seeing things settle into a new normal. The new normal isn’t back to 100%. There isn’t that much happening in the food service environment, the restaurant environment and the eating-away-from-home environment. So the industry is having to produce more for people to eat within their own homes. They’re doing that by increasing the productivity of their lines. They’re also taking food service products or lines that were focused on food service and reorienting them more to in-home consumption. That's true on both...

BOLINAS — In the 1970s, this remote seaside village gained a measure of notoriety when the quirky characters who lived here successfully halted new development and became the subject of the book, “The Town that Fought to Save Itself.”


  Now, nearly 50 years later, the Marin County town is fighting to save itself once again — this time from the threat of coronavirus. Starting Monday, a privately-funded guerrilla-style operation will be underway to test the entire town of 1,680 people for the deadly virus. It’s an extraordinarily rare privilege at a time when most of the country is desperate to get a handle on the extent of infection, but hamstrung by a lack of available tests.


  But this time, instead of counterculture hippies taking the lead, it’s the high-tech multimillionaires — including a venture capitalist whose wife founded Flickr, a biotech entrepreneur and the founder of Zynga games — who either live or have weekend homes in this reclusive village an hour north of San Francisco.


  “It’s this question of, well, do you just sit around and wait for the federal government to do something or do you try to take action and help?” said Jyri Engestrom, 42, the venture capitalist who has spearheaded the local effort along with Cyrus Harmon, who has raised his children here and founded the startup Olema Pharmaceuticals to find new treatments for breast cancer.


  There have been no confirmed coronavirus cases in town, but about half the residents are older than 60 and at higher risk from the virus. And Engestrom was particularly frustrated when one of the community’s first responders became sick with coronavirus symptoms, but because he had no direct connection with someone who tested positive, he couldn’t be tested himself.


  Like the isolated, wealthy communities of Telluride, Colorado, and Fisher Island, Florida, Bolinas has leveraged its wealth and connections to give its residents something for free that most Americans aren’t getting at all.


  Along with an enthusiastic cadre of local volunteers, organizers here are launching the drive-through, four-day testing project on a dirt lot next to the volunteer fire station.


  The town is partnering with scientists at UCSF, who will return results within 72 hours to determine who is actively infected, who has been infected and who is still at risk. If people test positive — even if they show no symptoms — Dr. Anna O’Malley from the local medical clinic will encourage them to isolate themselves. The information can help combat the spread of the virus and be used by UCSF as a model for other communities as politicians decide when and how to reopen a country and economy that has been on lockdown for a month.


  UCSF will be launching a similar effort Thursday in San Francisco’s largely Latino Mission District, where it hopes to test 5,700 people. Beginning in early May, UC Berkeley will be testing 5,000 people across several East Bay communities.


  So why Bolinas?


  “Why not Bolinas? It’s a terrific place. A community expressed the motivation and willpower to partner with the scientific community and policymakers to get this information,” said Dr. Diane Havlir, UCSF infectious disease specialist who is one of the leaders of the testing effort.


  “Wealthy people? Whatever. It’s a motivated community.”

Everytime he looks at his hands, JoJo Goodine is constantly reminded of his playing days at New Bedford High.
 And it's a good thing.
 "We played the Super Bowl on the astroturf at Boston College my junior year," said Goodine. "It was like playing on cement. I still have turf burns on my hands from that game."
 It was the first of back-to-back Div. 1A Super Bowl titles for Goodine and the Whalers.
 "There are many memories," the 43-year-old Goodine said. "I still remember certain plays. They are etched in your memory."
 It seemed like everything Goodine touched at New Bedford High turned to gold as he was a part of six state championships in his illustrious career. In addition to the pair of Super Bowls, he helped bring home two basketball state titles and two track state championships.
 "I just went out there and competed," said a humble Goodine. "I had no idea. I was just a kid trying to get through high school. I loved playing sports growing up so I knew I'd play sports in high school.
 "We had a lot of talented guys when we played. Sometimes you don't realize how good you had it when you were involved in it until years later. We were a bunch of really talented kids doing something special."
 From his Hall of Fame career, Goodine fondly remembers both Super Bowls, but the game that stood out the most to him was the Whalers' home win over Brockton in 1993.
 "The first time we beat Brockton that was big," he recalled nearly 27 years later. "We beat them at home my junior year to get to the Super Bowl. That was a big moment for the program and not just our team. Brockton was always that team we couldn't get over the hill against them. They were a big powerhouse in the state.
 "Junior year was our coming out party. It was home in New Bedford. Once we beat them, we knew we were going to the Super Bowl."
 The 5-foot-8 175-pound running back was virtually unstoppable as a junior and senior, going for more than 1,000 yards both years and scoring a school-record 27 touchdowns in back-to-back regular seasons. He finished his career as the Whalers' all-time touchdown leader with 70 (68 in the regular season). He also owns the single-game mark with six TDs in a 55-22 win over Xavier High of Connecticut in 1993.
 "I was elusive. I had good vision and I was fast," he said. "But when it came down to it, I was just a kid playing football."
 The 1994 Otto Graham Achievement Award winner drew attention from the likes of Boston College, Syracuse, Stanford, Penn State and Wake Forest, but opted to attend the University of New Hampshire after graduating from New Bedford High in 1995.
 He was one of three freshmen to play for the Division IAA Wildcats that fall.
 "It was a great experience," said Goodine, noting that Chip Kelly was his position coach at UNH. "Obviously I didn't have the season I did in high school, but I competed as a true freshman. It's a story I tell now.
 "The other two freshmen were Jerry Azumah and Dan Kreider. Kreider won a championship with the Pittsburgh Steelers and Azumah was an All-Pro cornerback with the Chicago Bears."
 Goodine returned to the SouthCoast after one year at New Hampshire and ended up at UMass Dartmouth, where he starred out of the backfield.
 "It went pretty well," he said. "We had a pretty good team."
 Goodine left UMD after a year, but still had a burning desire to play football so he traveled out to California looking to land a spot on the Azusa Pacific University football team.
 "I was out of football for a couple of years but I still had eligibility," he said. "I got to play spring ball there and practice with the guys. I worked out in the summer and was ready to go, but then I blew out my calf. Then my mom got sick and I made my way back here and I've been back ever since."
 Some friends got Goodine into the human services field and he's enjoyed working with at-risk youth in Bristol County for the past 16 years through Eliot Community Human Services.
 "It's great to help these kids out and give them life lessons," he said. "You give them a message that there is hope for them."
 More than 20 years after he started at UMass Dartmouth, Goodine got his degree in accounting from UMD in the spring of 2019.
 "My life has come full circle," he said. "I went back years later and finished what I had started."
 Goodine said he's taking a CPA prep class and is looking forward to what is in store for him in the future.
 "I've always been good with numbers," he said. "We'll see where this takes me."
 Goodine has been married to his wife, Joy, for a year now and they have four children: Ranen, 15, Joseph III, 14, Jarren, 13, and Jasmine, 10.
 Goodine says they're all involved in sports and keep him busy.
 "I'm volunteering with football, basketball and baseball," he said. "That fills up my desire for sports. It's fun for me. That's what I did when I was younger. I was always busy growing up. It's the same now. It keeps my life going."
 Goodine said he tries to catch as many New Bedford High football games as he can. He also spent one year as a volunteer coach for Rudy Bulgar in his first season at Fairhaven.
 As far as playing goes, Goodine was a part of a national championship for flag football in 2004.
 "Obviously New Bedford is a talented area for football," he said. "A bunch of us old guys got together and won a national championship."
 While he enjoys reminiscing about what the Whalers did on the football field, Goodine cherishes the relationships he made even more.
 "We don't always talk about all the memories in the games," he said. "We talk about the instances in practices and all the things that got us to the Super Bowl championships. The silly stories; stuff that has nothing to do with the sport. The memories with your buddies. We were like family.
 "We still get together to this day; that's what is special about sports. You develop relationships that last a lifetime."

CHEYENNE, Wyo. (AP) — Joe Biden has won Wyoming’s Democratic presidential caucus, which had been postponed for two weeks and scaled back to just mail-in ballots because of the coronavirus pandemic, state party officials said Sunday. The results come less than two weeks after Bernie Sanders dropped out and endorsed Biden, who is the only candidate still actively seeking the Democratic nomination. Voting began when it was still a two-candidate race. The Wyoming Democratic Party announced the results after tabulating votes Saturday and auditing the results overnight. What was originally to be a combination of in-person caucusing, drop-off and mail-in vote tabulation on April 4 was scaled back to just drop-off and mail-in — and finally just mail-in voting. Party officials then pushed back the due date for mailed ballots and tabulation to help ensure participation. The mailed-in ballots were due at Wyoming Democratic Party headquarters Friday. Party officials used a courier to drive the ballots to Denver for tabulation. The party for the first time used ranked-choice voting to allocate delegates to the Democratic National Convention in August. Voters could rank up to five candidates according to their preference. Besides Biden and Sanders, Hawaii U.S. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard; former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg; former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg; Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren; Minnesota U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar; and investor Tom Steyer, of San Francisco; were on the ballot.

Finding a spot on pavement is ideal, but gravel is still a decent second choice, Kosilla said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Montoya suggests owners heed signage, park in a safe area, and avoid leaving valuable items in their vehicle for long periods of time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

I have been on deadlines for more than three decades now, from my current 13-year employer, Examiner Media, to the old North County News; with stops at the Bedford-Record, the Putnam County News & Recorder, and the Halston papers along the way. I've loved nearly every minute of it, including the friendships I’ve formed with fans, athletes, administrators, teachers and coaches, but I’ve especially loved the final product; the pun-filled, sensationalized back- and front-page headlines, which, I’m told, have made a lot of student athletes’ days, as well as delighted parents and grandparents alike.

"I'm hopeful that we can reach an agreement, that the Senate can pass this tomorrow, and that the House can take it up on Tuesday, and, Wednesday, we'd be back up and running," Mnuchin said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

Peyton Manning, the No. 1 overall pick by Indianapolis in the 1998 NFL Draft, said Sunday that he gave some advice to quarterback Joe Burrow, the presumptive top selection in Thursday's draft. The Cincinnati Bengals will choose first and are expected to nab Burrow, who led LSU to a national championship and won the Heisman Trophy in 2019.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            "What I told him, 'Look Joe, if you're the first pick in the NFL draft you are going to a team that has earned the first pick in the NFL draft. There are going to be some holes there," Manning said on ESPN. "There's a reason the Colts were picking No. 1 (in 1998). There's a reason the Bengals are picking No. 1 this year.'" Manning told Burrow that while the ride might be rough, the experience will be invaluable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            The Colts were 3-13 in Manning's rookie season. The next season, they were 13-3 and made the first of 11 trips to the postseason with Manning at quarterback. "[Then-Colts coach] Jim Mora never took me out. I learned some things in the fourth quarter of those blowouts about what it took to be an NFL quarterback," Manning said. "That wouldn't have happened if I hadn't have hung in there and learned the ropes as a rookie, even though we took some bumps and bruises.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            "So that's what I tried to encourage Joe and all the other rookie quarterbacks, that your rookie year is not going to be the same as your senior year in college. But if you learn how fast the defensive backs are, how soon you have to get rid of the ball, understand defenses, you can become a better player and really get it going the year or two after that." --Field Level Media                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

There is a point in one's life where you live long enough to become an expert in something. Expertise can be in almost any subject under the sun. You might be a self-described expert in golf, fishing, guitars, baking bread, sculpture and the list goes on. Honestly, I count myself an expert in a handful of subjects (don't we all!) but I won't bore you with the details. The question is what qualifies someone to be an expert? When questions like this come up, I turn to the Websters Dictionary (merriam-webster.com) They define an expert as "one with special skill or knowledge representing mastery of a particular subject."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

Along the 2,000-mile U.S.-Mexico border through which the vast majority of illegal drugs cross, the normally bustling vehicle traffic that smugglers use for cover has slowed to a trickle. Bars, nightclubs and motels across the country that are ordinarily fertile marketplaces for drug dealers have shuttered. And prices for drugs in short supply have soared to gouging levels.

Laos, rated 171st in FIFA's rankings below the likes of Cayman Islands, New Caledonia and Nepal, had Robson's team on the run in the Southeast Asian championships opening night which ended 2-2.

Mallorca this month signed Ienaga on a contract until 2015 and the 24-year-old must initially go out on loan because the club have already filled their quota of three non-European Union players in their squad.
 Vice president Lorenzo Serra Ferrer told a news conference at the player's presentation, attended by around 60 journalists including some 30 Japanese, that the club had had several offers.
 "There is also a possibility that we will loan him to a top second-division team, not because we don't have faith in the quality of the player but because it is not in our interest to strengthen our rivals (in the first division)," he said.
 "As well as the Spanish league, there is also interest from Netherlands and Germany," he added. "We'll see at the right time, there is nothing decided."
 Ienaga has played with J-League sides Gamba Osaka and Oita Trinita and scored four goals in 31 appearances for Cerezo Osaka this year.
 He is the second Japanese player to join Mallorca, following in the footsteps of Yoshito Okubo who played at the Balearic Island club between 2005 and 2007.
 "My first choice would be to play for Mallorca but I have confidence in the club and in Lorenzo and I won't worry too much about the decisions," Ienaga said. "I will work."

Serverless computing is all the rage these days as it shifts the task of running and managing the infrastructure from the company to its cloud provider. While software as a service (SaaS), infrastructure as a service (IaaS), and Platform as a Service (PaaS) are already well known and popular in the domain of serverless computing, there is another upcoming technology – function as a service (FaaS) – which is primed to become mainstream soon enough.

To market and sell their plants, students opted for a virtual sale. Sutherlin’s plant sale was originally scheduled for April 24-25 and May 1-2. The virtual sale started on April 15 and will last until May 2.                                                                                            Sutherlin FFA Advisor Wes Crawford said he wasn’t expecting it to be that busy, but when he saw sales numbers from the website on Wednesday he quickly realized it was going to be a busy weekend.                                                                                            On Friday, the drive-thru pickup line at Sutherlin High School had more than 60 cars at one point. Customers were be able to stay in the car, while Sutherlin staff loaded plants into trunks and tailgates to minimize interpersonal contact.                                                                                            “There are 20 students working from home, collecting the pictures and plant information for the website, growing seeds, running the marketing, scheduling volunteers, and coordinating the overall sale,” Crawford said.                                                                                            The majority of the students in the advanced plant science class are seniors and, even though Gov. Kate Brown released a path to graduation that said students in good standing would receive their diploma, the seniors have continued to show up for virtual meetings to help with the plant sale.                                                                                            “Every one of those seniors was in the virtual meeting this morning at 10 a.m., discussing what needs to be done and how to achieve it,” Crawford said Monday. “They are fully engaged, committed, and eager to see the months of work they put in before the campus closure come full circle. You wouldn’t believe the man hours put in the last two days of school in the afternoons and evenings, getting plants transplanted and ready before they were no longer able to get there; it wasn’t because it was assigned, it was because they care.”

"Why anyone would want to set our car alight and risk people's lives in the middle of a world crisis, is beyond me. We keep ourselves to ourselves and have never done anything to upset anyone. I can't think of anyone who could be so hateful towards us. It must have been random. There are neighbours' cars and vans parked all along the street.

While he had said he thought trucks could make the turn onto Hamlin, Boaz said he received a text message from Police Chief Robby Jackson that in his opinion it _would_ be difficult for trucks to make the turn from East Main Street onto Hamlin, if they couldn't go straight across from Bullington.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

Furious Thai fans have demanded the resignation of the country's football president and want answers as to why a side once tipped to become an Asian football heavyweight has stumbled embarrassingly in every competition since Robson took over.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The former Manchester United skipper, who replaced compatriot Peter Reid in September 2009, called his own news conference to explain the team's dire form and admitted he would not give himself a passing grade in his first national team job.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    "No, I don't count anything as a pass until we win," a stern-faced Robson said when asked to evaluate his performance as Thailand boss. "I'm quite disappointed, I want to win and it's results that matter."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Under Robson, Thailand failed to reach the Asian Cup for the first time in 23 years and were bundled out of the Southeast Asian Games and the Southeast Asian championship - competitions they have long dominated - in the opening rounds.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Draws against strugglers Laos, Malaysia and the Maldives in the last three months were the final straw for angry Thai fans who had witnessed a major facelift under Reid, whose new-look, free-flowing team climbed rapidly up the FIFA world rankings.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Robson said he would not step down because he believed in his players and said the team had suffered due to the success of revamped domestic competitions, which had left his players exhausted and poorly prepared for national duty.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The former Middlesbrough, West Bromwich Albion, Sheffield United and Bradford City boss also rejected criticism he had spent too much time being a TV pundit and a global ambassador for Manchester United and said he was committed to his job.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    "As far as I'm concerned, I'm coach here fulltime," he said. "People have said I keep going back to England or to Singapore to do TV work but I've not left Thailand for six months, other than for matches and last season I attended 72 (local) games."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    He wants Thai football to be better organised and was confident that if given proper support, he could reverse his team's form in time for 2014 World Cup qualifiers next year.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    "It's frustrating coming from the Premier League, people here do things off the cuff, it's a big change in mentality," he said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    "Everyone here is passionate about the game and everyone is very disappointed. We couldn't give the fans what they wanted. But there's hope there, we have the ability."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

"It's heart-breaking, but we know there are more important things out there going on. One day hopefully we'll be back there competing."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Higgins, who lost in the first round of his world championship debut in 1995, took the title in 1998, 2007, 2009 and 2011.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    But the past three years have seen him finish runner-up to Mark Selby, Mark Williams and Judd Trump.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    "I've got to take heart from reaching those finals, it shows I'm doing something right," Higgins said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    "I tried my hardest but just came up against three unbelievable champions.

Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc has started to use thermal cameras at its warehouses to speed up screening for feverish workers who could be infected with the coronavirus, employees told Reuters.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The cameras in effect measure how much heat people emit relative to their surroundings. They require less time and contact than forehead thermometers, earlier adopted by Amazon, the workers said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Cases of the virus have been reported among staff at more than 50 of Amazon's US warehouses. That has prompted some workers to worry for their safety and walk off the job. Unions and elected officials have called on Amazon to close buildings down.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The use of cameras, previously unreported, shows how America's second-biggest corporate employer is exploring methods to contain the virus' spread without shuttering warehouses essential to its operation.

"We are past the high point, and all indications at this point is that we are on the descent," Cuomo told a press conference.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    "Whether or not the descent continues depends on what we do, but right now we're on the descent." New York has borne the brunt of the virus in the United States, which has killed more than 13,000 people in the state, with more than 226,000 known infections. A field hospital has been erected in New York City's Central Park, and the state's shutdown -- which orders residents to stay at home except to exercise or perform essential business -- has been extended until May 15.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    It is "good news only compared to the terrible news that we were living with, which is that constant increase" in hospitalizations and deaths, Cuomo said of the latest data. "It's no time to get cocky and it's no time to get arrogant. We have a long way to go and a lot of work to do. This virus has been ahead of us every step of the way.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    "We still have to make sure that we keep that beast under control.".                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

The ferroalloy market in India is engaged in a close combat with the Malaysia and Indonesia markets as they allow for cheap imports into the Indian land. While an additional capacity of 180,000 tons of ferroalloy is scheduled to hit the market in 2017, a whopping 365,000 tons was brought in the previous year. Besides this, the power tariff in India is extortionate compared to that of the other markets producing ferroalloy. This is likely to put the non-captive producers in a challenging position. There is an upward pressure expected on the part of ferroalloy production because of the anti-dumping duty on phos coke in China. The challenge is anticipated to aggravate with the less availability of low phos coke in India.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange
