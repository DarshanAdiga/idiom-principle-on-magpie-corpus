The Mt. Hawley Bowl team needed a big finish last Monday night to distance itself from the crowd in the Perfect Angle Pro Shop/Bill Mastronardi Masters league.
   
 The foursome of Andy Stone, Adam Johnson, Chad Barnes and Joe Robards came through with flying colors.
   
 Mt. Hawley claimed the first-third title in the league with a convincing 40-10 decision over Bullpen at Sunset Lanes in Pekin. The team finished 11 points ahead of Striketown, which lost a 31-19 match against the Plaza Lanes team on Monday.
   
 Barnes led Mt. Hawley with a 740, while Stone added 718, Johnson 703 and Robards 607.
   
 "Since all of us have bowled together in the past, we have a great chemistry between everyone, and were able to keep each other positive," said Stone, the team captain who drafted the team. "That was my focus during the draft, and so far so good.
   
 "Adam, Chad, and I have been able to play fairly close to each other, and we've communicated well when someone is noticing transition."
   
 The win guarantees the Mt. Hawley team of a spot in the league roll-off.
   
 The Potter's Alley team got a 300 from team captain Steve Taylor in a 30-20 win over Landmark Lanes. The victory moved Potter's into third place.
   
 Plaza Lanes placed fourth and Linn Lanes fifth. Brian Davis led the league with a 763 series, including closing games of 279 and 289, while Kenny Shockency opened with a 300 game for Linn.
   
 The traveling league begins its second third of the season on Monday at Potter's Alley in Morton.
   
 QUITE A PERFORMANCE
   
 I was at West Park Lanes in Columbia last Sunday to watch my son, Andre, and his teammates Rob Johnson and Jordyn (Sussenbach) Young try and defend their title in the Gran Prix Mixed Trios event. Each team had to be composed of a senior bowler (age 50 and over), a female and a bowler younger than 50.
   
 They made a good run, but the stacked team of Jason Queen, Pete Weber and Tammy Walsh ran away from the field to claim the title and the top prize of $1,800.
   
 Johnson opened the tournament with games of 279, 289 and 268 for an 836 series (his 16th career 800), and finished with an eight-game total of 2,013 (251.6 average). Andre totaled 1,873 (234.1) and Young added 1,624 (203) to help the team finish in seventh place in the tough 16-team field.
   
 The big story of the day was the bowling by Queen, who averaged 265 for his eight games. After struggling with an opening 215 game, he followed with back- to-back 300 games, and added a third trey in Game 5.
   
 "After the first game, I thought I should start striking more so they wouldn't kick me off the team," joked Queen, who is from Decatur. "I've had back-to- back 300s before, but never three in four games."
   
 Walsh was second on the winning team with 1,935 (241.9) and Weber, one of the all-time greats on the PBA Tour, 1,862 (232.8). The trio finished qualifying 227 pins ahead of the field.
   
 Queen is no stranger to 300 games. He rolled a televised perfect game on his way to winning the 1997 USBC (then ABC) Masters as an amateur player when he was just 23 years old. Earl Anthony, the color commentator for the telecast, said it was Queen's 21st career trey at the time.
   
 Queen has had many more 300s since then, and was close to a fourth on his final game on Sunday. He opened with eight straight strikes before leaving a 7-pin in a closing 279 effort.
   
 PBA WRAP UP
   
 The 2020 PBA Playoffs conclude on Sunday, with the quarterfinals, semifinals and championship matches, starting at 1 p.m. on FS1.
   
 It is the final event of the 2020 PBA Tour season, with the winner earning $100,000 and an official WWE championship title.
   
 The quarterfinal matches will be Jason Belmonte vs. Francois Lavoie, Anthony Simonsen vs. defending champion Kris Prather of Plainfield, Bill O'Neill vs. Kyle Troup, and Brad Miller vs. Tom Smallwood.
   
 The semifinals and finals are set to start at 3 p.m.

An Illinois man was killed in a two-vehicle accident Saturday in Warren County.
 According to Indiana State Police reports, just after 2 p.m. Saturday, the Indiana State Police responded to a two vehicle fatal crash that occurred on US 136, just west of the Wabash River bridge.
 Preliminary investigation by Trooper Chandler Stanton revealed that a 2019 Harley Davidson motorcycle, operated by James McVey, 28, of Bolingbrook, Illinois, was traveling westbound on US 136 when it crossed the center line for an unknown reason. At the same time, a 2015 Chevrolet Colorado driven by a 28-year-old male from Johnson County was traveling eastbound when the Harley Davidson came into his lane. The driver of the Chevrolet attempted to avoid the Harley Davidson but was unable to do so, and as a result the motorcycle hit the driver's side of the pickup truck. The Chevrolet traveled off the south side of the road, struck a guard rail, and came to a final rest. The Harley Davidson came to rest in the middle of the east and west bound lanes.
 As a result of the crash McVey suffered fatal injuries and was pronounced dead at the scene by the Warren County Coroner. Notification to the next of kin has been made.

Pressure is on Inter Miami, Gonzalo Higuain as team faces must-win home game on Sunday
   *[FT]: Financial Times


--DocBreak--
Despite losing back-to-back games, Miami coach Diego Alonso and the players insisted they were still optimistic.
 "There's massive pressure, I wouldn't downplay it, but pressure's what you want because that means there's something at stake," Morgan said before the game.
 "We've got pressure from ourselves internally, pressure from outside and the fans and we want to make them proud too. So, yeah, we've got a lot on our shoulders, but we hope to use all that energy to drive us on and get the victory."
 The urgency of Sunday's game was evident from the opening whistle. Despite the stormy conditions, Miami players looked sharp and set the tempo.
 There was some question whether the game would be played at all as Hurricane watches were called for the surrounding areas. The wind swirled so much that an American football style "holder" was needed for free kicks because the ball was moving too much. The corner flags were swaying almost to the ground, and surrounding trees were blowing in all directions.
 But none of that was enough to ruin Miami's final home game.
 Inter Miami dominated from the start and scored two first-half goals in a five-minute span to take a comfortable lead over the last-place visitors.
 The first came from an unlikely source, backup left back Mikey Ambrose, who started in place of injured Ben Sweat. Ambrose, playing in just his fifth game all season, settled the ball with his chest and then cranked a left-footed rocket from outside the box into the bottom right corner following a Miami corner kick.
 "I am very happy for Mikey because he worked hard behind Ben Sweat all season and his goal was a reward for his efforts, and it was well-deserved," Alonso said.
 Then, in the 23rd minute, Leandro Gonzalez Pirez made it 2-0, curling in a Lewis Morgan corner kick from the left side.
 "That was crazy wind and crazy conditions," said Gonzalez Pirez. "When we knew the hurricane was coming so close to our game time, we imagined this weather. It was so difficult to play in it. The first half we had the wind on our side, so we knew we had to do everything in the first half. So, we scored two goals and then in the second half we managed the lead. The rain was no problem, but the wind was crazy. We are super happy to win the game and make the playoffs in our first year."
 Inter Miami maintained the two-goal lead until the 66th minute, when Cincinnati's Joseph-Claude Gyau scored on a left-footed shot from outside the box to the top left corner, past the outstretched arms of Miami goalkeeper John McCarthy. Brandon Vazquez had the assist.
 Gyau is a 28-year-old Tampa native whose father, Phillip Gyau, played for the U.S. national team.
 Desperate to preserve the lead late in the game, Inter Miami coach Diego Alonso made two substitutions in the 83rd minute. Lewis Morgan and Rodolfo Pizarro went out, and Victor Ulloa and Alvas Powell went in.
 The final minutes got even more tense after defender Andres Reyes picked up a second yellow card in the 88th minute, leaving Inter Miami down a man until the end of the game.
 Missing from Miami roster for the third game in a row was Brek Shea. The versatile veteran, who scored a few big goals this season, missed the previous two games with an undisclosed injury he suffered at home. Coach Diego Alonso said on Thursday that Shea had recovered, practiced and would be ready for Sunday's game. But he was not on the roster.
 Asked about his absence, a team spokesperson said Shea had not been "medically cleared" to play. He was replaced by Juan Agudelo, who played 63 minutes and then headed to the bench in place of Julian Carranza.
 Inter Miami will play its opening playoff game on Friday Nov. 20 on the road against fellow expansion club Nashville SC. Miami will likely be without Pizarro, who is expected to travel to Europe with the Mexican national team for two friendlies against Japan and South Korea.

Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes strolled to his right behind the offensive line Sunday afternoon, temporarily abandoning the snap to bark out a couple of instructions, and on the opposite side of the field, Panthers cornerback Rasul Douglas relaxed for a moment.
 His first mistake.
 Mahomes turned and darted back left, and as he called and received the snap from center Austin Reiter, he was actually on the run -- like a receiver in motion as the play began. Douglas followed the movement, taking a step forward, completely baited by the oddity of it all.
 His second mistake.
 The man Douglas had intended to defend -- Chiefs receiver Demarcus Robinson -- sprinted by him on a drag route across the back of the end zone unguarded. Mahomes picked him out, and as far as pitch-and-catches go, they don't come much more easily.

Bayern Munich are the team to beat now
 After eight straight wins that have seen them score 26 goals and concede none, Bayern Munich not Wolfsburg are the team to beat in the Women's Bundesliga at the moment.
 Wolfsburg have owned the league for the past four years, but Bayern's chances of challenging for the trophy are as good as ever this year. A 3-0 win against newly promoted Meppen helped Bayern stay two points clear of Wolfsburg at the top of the table.
 Jens Scheuer's side mean business. After the departures of players like Kathrin Hendrich and Melanie Leupolz, the club has managed to build a new and stronger foundation. The arrival of top prospects like Lea Schüller, Klara Bühl, Sarah Zadrazil and the experienced Marina Hegering, who has made an immediate impact to their defense, have kept Bayern strong.

The Season Finale 500 started out poorly for Elliott considering that his car failed inspection twice prior to the opening pace laps. Instead of starting from the pole position, he had to begin the race at the rear of the pack. Logano and Keselowski moved to the front row and led the drivers to green.
 However, Elliott did not remain in the rear for long. He used the bottom of the track to his advantage and sped around several drivers, ultimately making his way back into contention. He continued to fight for stage wins -- although Logano won the first while Keselowski won the second.
 The end of Stage 2 sparked numerous reactions on social media considering that Elliott led the field into the final lap. Keselowski was on his fellow driver's tail but didn't appear to have an opening to make a move. The situation changed when Elliott slowed a bit entering the final corner. Keselowski kept his foot on the gas and took a stunning lead to secure the stage win.
 Hamlin and Logano both kept fans engaged in the race throughout the afternoon. Logano won Stage 1 and appeared to have a dominant car early while Hamlin struggled to find speed. The No. 11 team made some adjustments and helped Hamlin get back into contention.

 While many NASCAR fans expected Kevin Harvick to lead for most of the race and ultimately win, he remained further back in the pack. The driver that won nine races during the 2020 season couldn't keep up with the championship four. Hamlin, Keselowski, Logano and Elliott continued to hold the top four spots, alternating positions with each passing lap.
 Now that the season is over, the four championship drivers will look ahead to 2021. Hamlin will search for another Daytona 500 win in February while also serving as co-owner of a 23XI Racing. Logano and Keselowski will both return to Team Penske with the Bill France Cup on their minds. Finally, Elliott will help form a new Hendrick Motorsports roster now that Jimmie Johnson is done with Cup racing and Kyle Larson is joining the team. Of course, his focus will remain on winning a second championship.
