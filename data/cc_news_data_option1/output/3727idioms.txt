She was anxious all summer waiting for Frederick County Public Schools to decide how it was going to operate for the fall semester. When FCPS settled on a virtual model, Shelhorse was relieved despite knowing there would be challenges.


  She takes it day by day. The toughest part are her daughters’ differing schedules. Even though they both attend Kemptown Elementary School, they start the school day at different times and have separate breaks and lunches.


  “They are just constantly on and off the computer at different times...so trying to manage that and making sure that they’re on when they need to be and that they can find their assignments...I’m just trying to take it one day at a time,” Shelhorse said.


  Single parents already have it tough, with a lack of two incomes and a partner to share child care and household responsibilities. The pandemic and introduction of virtual learning this fall has added yet another challenge.


  According to census data, one in five Frederick County households in 2017 were single-parent households. Nationally, numbers have been on the rise.


  According to a Pew Research study published last year, out of 130 countries and territories analyzed, the United States had the world’s highest rate of children living in single-parent households, around 23 percent, compared to countries like China, Nigeria and India, all of which have fewer than 6 percent of children living with only one parent.


  It’s a struggle known far too well for many parents and children, but Shelhorse knows things could be a lot worse for her. She feels fortunate to be able to work from home and be there when her kids run into issues, unlike Ramont Scott, a single dad of two who is employed as a postal worker.


  Scott is considered an essential employee, and both of his parents are deceased.


  When FCPS decided to go virtual, Scott had to quickly figure out who was going to take care of his youngest child during the day. Scott’s son is a junior at Frederick High School and is independent, he said, but his daughter is a second-grader at Lincoln Elementary School and needs help with everything from getting online to completing assignments.


  Luckily Scott was able to enroll his daughter at the local YMCA where she spends the day doing her school work. It’s still been hard, though. One day, Scott’s daughter had some technical issues and he had to solve it while at work.


  “It was just tough because I’m at work and I got to speak to tech support and then I got to relay the message to the YMCA and it’s an ongoing circle. This is just tough,” Scott said.


  Scott feels single parents, especially those who are essential workers, were forgotten when plans for schooling were developed both in the county and nationwide.


  “No one ever thought about the single parent in this. The postal worker or the nurse or the person at Walmart stocking shelves that can’t work from home...I can’t quit my job,” Scott said. “It was very stressful...I didn’t have a back-up plan, it was always take my kids to my mom or dad’s but that wasn’t an option anymore.”


  But he also knows there was never going to be a perfect solution.


  “I don’t think there’s a right answer to it...there was never going to be an answer that was going to satisfy everybody,” Scott said.


  Lauri Edwards is in a similar situation. The single mom of three children all under the age of 10 works fulltime, inperson at a local veterinary clinic.


  She lives with her parents, who offer some support, but the added challenge for Edwards is that her youngest child is a special education student.

Strength in our lower bodies is not only good for us but is a necessity for everyday life. In addition to walking, we sit and stand, bend and squat, lean and lunge, and everything else in between. All of those motions require leg strength, and to attain that, variety is key.      Our move today is a step back lunge. This exercise will be working your quadriceps, hamstrings, glutes and calves. All you need is a smooth surface for lunging.      To begin this exercise, start by standing tall with your feet placed about hip-width. Holding your chest up, and engaging your abdominals for added balance, step back with your right foot.      Keeping the weight on the ball of your foot; proceed to sit into the extended leg by bending in that knee. Your front knee will be bending as well but be mindful to keep the positioning behind the front foot.      Continue to bend and sit into this step back lunge as low as you are comfortable doing then proceed to push back up to your starting position. Stand tall, with both feet returned to level ground. Then repeat the same movement on the left side.      Keeping your hands positioned just on your hips, shoot for at least eight to 10 lunges on each side for three sets each.      If you need intensity, you can hold a set of hand weights in each hand. And if you need a little help with balance, you can hold a broomstick just in front of you.      If you have issues with knee pain, you can keep the lunge shallow. Just be mindful to engage the muscles you are focusing on.      This step back lunge is great added into any lower body routine, and is also a great move to help with balance and stability.

In August, county election officials in Montana cited another rash of voter confusion stemming from mailers sent by a group called The Patriots Foundation. The mailers in that case included an absentee ballot form and language encouraging recipients that voting absentee is “fast, easy and safe!” Nothing about the mailers was illegal. However, Gallatin County Election Manager Casey Hayes did respond with a press release saying his office had been inundated with calls, all of them from mailer recipients who were already set to get absentee ballots in the mail.


  Hayes said the votedaines.com website is "the new electronic version of that analogue mailer."


  "I think the votedaines.com stuff was being sent to voters through text, so it's just another avenue of approach for outside organizations to interact with these voters, Hayes said.


  In light of the impacts the coronavirus pandemic is having on the 2020 general election — more than two-thirds of the counties in the state have opted to conduct the Nov. 3 election by mail — election officials and voter rights advocates alike believe it’s more critical than ever for voters to have accurate information. That includes knowing whether the forms they’re filling out are the right ones.


  “Misleading information, even if well-intentioned, can discourage prospective voters to the point they stop trying,” said Nancy Leifer, president of the League of Women Voters Montana. “Montana law requires voter registration, absentee ballot requests and voting to be done on paper with proper signatures and turned in to your county election office. While this seems old-fashioned, this safeguards our elections against hacking and cyber-attacks. If you see information indicating you can do any of these things online or in any other way, don’t waste your time on them.”


  Hayes said the best way for voters to ensure that they’re registering to vote or updating their voter information the right way is to simply contact their county elections office and ask. The “My Voter Page” on the Montana Secretary of State’s website is another reliable resource, as is any official correspondence from local election officials, which typically aren’t glossy, colorful mailers but rather envelopes bearing the offices’ official seal.


  For the most part, Hayes doesn't take much issue with third-party mailers, provided they don't contain incorrect information. They often create a "touchpoint" between his office and voters, an opportunity for people to reach out to him with questions and get the right information, he said. Hayes' only concern with websites like the votedaines.com site would be if voters disregard or don't see the subsequent follow-ups from his office.


  “Our concern is that some folks have used this website thinking that that’s the panacea, that that’s what’s going to fix their problem,” Hayes said. “We’re just hopeful that they’re looking into their emails to see our responses that say, ‘Here’s the next step.’ But all in all, any organization that’s going to push voters our way in order to create a more accurate address list and list of voters, we’re going to accept that and we’re going to welcome that, even if it means we’re going to have to do a little more legwork on our side.”


  As for the site’s survey directing only avowed Trump supporters to update their voter status? Hayes and Seaman declined to comment. Rutherford, though, said he wasn’t a fan.


  “I’ve never seen anything like that,” he said. “I wish everybody was treated uniformly.”

China's internal debates and discussions made repeated references to how unlike India which has always considered its northern and north-western borders with China and Pakistan as the gravest national security challenge and made meticulous preparations all along, and where the same deployment can provide defence against both the adversaries to some extent at the same time, China's national defence focus in the last 70 years have shifted from north to south and southeast but never so much to the southwest.

“It is fun to see the faces of the kids when they go for a ride,” he said. He also said there are plenty of fathers and grandfathers who bring their children or grandchildren to the threshing bee to share history of agriculture. “Some of the fathers remember their dads or grandpas bringing them,” he laughed. He went on to say the threshing bee is certainly a family event. “It is a good place to look back at the beginning and see how things were done in the past,” he said.


  In fact, Wombacher was one of those dads. He took his son, Cody, to the threshing bee when he was about 10 years old. “I believe it was the second year of the bee when it was held at Ove Larson’s property,” he said. “We went that year and I have gone every year since.”


  Cody was active in the club from then he until he left for college. He helped run the model train. Cody and his wife, Autumn, and their daughter, Calli, now live in Victor, Idaho. Wombacher said his granddaughter enjoys the train when she comes to visit in the summer, along with swimming in the Choteau swimming pool.


  Wombacher, who is married to Vickie, is a native of Colorado. He has lived in Choteau since 1973, working as a mechanic. He worked for Abbott Massey Ferguson Tractor and Ear Mountain Machinery before co-owning WW Exchange with Harvey Wilt. From 1994 until his retirement in 2014, he worked for Greyn’s Fertilizer.


  He said a big part of volunteering with the group is the friendships he has made both locally and around the state. “The Teton doesn’t stand for the county but Teton River Basin,” Wombacher said. “There have been members from around the state, Conrad, Missoula, even a couple from Washington state,” he added. “They come from all over to enjoy the couple days we gather.”


  He was humbled to be honored at this year’s threshing bee. “It shows they (his fellow members) respect what I have done and me as a person,” he said. “It is nice to be recognized for something I enjoy.”


  Wombacher invites everyone to come and spend a little time at the grounds this weekend and if you’re a youngster, maybe take a little ride on the train.

In European health-care systems, dedicated product reimbursement granted by publicly-funded healthcare systems or health funds is a key factor for the widespread adoption of the devices. In the Eastern European region, the proliferating demand for advanced wound care in home care settings is expected to augment the employment of the devices in this sector in the long run.

MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Minnesota has backed Democratic presidential candidates for nearly half a century and rarely receives much attention during the final stages of the race, when campaigns typically focus their resources on more traditional swing states like Florida or Pennsylvania.But Minnesota will feel like a genuine battleground on Friday when President Donald Trump and his Democratic challenger, Joe Biden, campaign here to mark the beginning of early voting.They’re expected to avoid the urban core of Minneapolis to focus on rural and working class voters, some of whom shifted to Republicans for the first time in 2016. Trump will be in Bemidiji, about 200 miles (320 kilometers) north of Minneapolis, while Biden will swing through Duluth, on the banks of Lake Superior and close to the Wisconsin border.Since narrowly losing Minnesota in 2016, Trump has focused relentlessly on the state in hopes that a victory this year could offset losses in other states. He has visited regularly and kept a close eye on issues of particular importance to rural corners of the state, reversing an Obama administration policy prohibiting the development of copper-nickel mining and bailing out soybean, corn and other farmers who have been hurt by trade clashes with China.More recently, he’s embraced a “law and order” message aimed at white suburban and rural voters who may be concerned by protests that have sometimes become violent. That’s especially true in Minnesota, where the May killing of George Floyd by a police officer sparked a national reckoning on systemic racism.But for all the work Trump has put into the state, it may elude him again in November.A series of polls over the past week show Biden has built a consistent lead over Trump. And in the 2018 midterms, Democratic turnout surged in suburbs, small cities and even on the Iron Range, across the blue- collar mining towns that were once labor strongholds but had been trending Republican.David McIntosh, president of the conservative Club for Growth, which has produced anti-Biden ads, said Minnesota may help the Trump campaign build momentum.“They’re looking beyond the poll numbers and seeing the potential there,” said McIntosh, a former congressman from Indiana. “It’s always smart strategy to go on offense somewhere.”In 2018, Democrats flipped two suburban congressional districts, took back control of the state House by winning suburban Trump-voting areas and came within one seat of winning control of the state Senate. Democrats won every statewide race that year, even as they lost a rural congressional district.Trump’s path to Minnesota success likely depends on finding more votes in rural, conservative areas –- running up the score beyond his 2016 tally. It’s a strategy he’s trying to pull off elsewhere and depends on a robust field operation with the money and time to track down infrequent or first-time voters. That could be a tall order since Minnesota already sports one of the nation’s highest voter turnout rates.“I don’t think they’re there,” said Joe Radinovich, a Democrat who lost a bid for a northern Minnesota congressional district in 2018. Radinovich noted the major organizational challenge and expense in tracking new voters, making sure they’re registered and getting them to vote – especially during a pandemic. “We have relatively high turnout already. Most people vote. I just don’t think it’s there. I think those people showed up in 2016,” he said.In 2016, Trump won that district that includes the Democratic city of Duluth by 15 percentage points. But in the midterms two years later, Radinovich lost by just under 6 percentage points.Still, Trump has spent more than a year building a sizable Minnesota ground game. Republicans are out knocking on doors and interacting personally with voters in ways that Democrats mostly have not, preferring online operations amid the coronavirus.The president’s reelection campaign announced this week a $10 million ad buy in a series of states, including Minnesota. It has spent nearly $17 million on advertising in the state since last October, compared to almost $6.3 million for Biden over the same period, according to a review of Kantar/CMAG data by The Associated Press.Democrats warn that Biden still may have his work cut out for him. Duluth Mayor Emily Larson said the Trump campaign has far outpaced Biden in local yard signs — which indicates enthusiasm but may not ultimately affect the outcome.“One of the things the Trump campaign has been very good about is visibility in Duluth, but also in areas around Duluth,” Larson said.Ken Martin, chairman of the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, said that while Biden isn’t likely to carry the congressional district that includes Duluth, he might be able to pick up enough support there to deny Trump the votes he needs to win statewide.“If your opponent is on the ropes or on the ground, you don’t get up,” Martin said.___Associated Press writer Steve Karnowski contributed to this report from Minneapolis.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.
