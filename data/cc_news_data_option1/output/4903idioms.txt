In light of Memphis Depay being linked with a move to Barcelona, Clarence Seedorf has confessed that the Dutch forward could shine if he does sign for the Camp Nou side. The 26-year-old was close to a move over the summer window but the La Liga’s salary rules prevented the deal from taking place.

Speaking of Chark, rookie receiver Collin Johnson stepped up in the third-year player's absence, leading the team in receiving and accumulating four catches for 96 yards and a touchdown. His longest play would come in the form of a 46-yard touchdown reception where he ran a post and Glennon hit him on the money as he got over the top of the coverage. That put the score at 13-10 in favor of the Jags late in the second quarter, however, the Browns answered with an Austin Hooper touchdown reception before the half.

Lastly, in the fourth quarter, both teams exchanged touchdowns with Nick Chubb and the Browns striking first with a one-yard touchdown run, putting the score at a 27-19 figure. Jags rookie running back James Robinson seemingly didn't want to be outdone, answering with a 4-yard rushing touchdown of his own. That put the score at 27-25 late in the fourth quarter and they elected to go for a 2-point conversion to tie it up. Unfortunately, the attempt was a failed one that allowed the Browns to get the last possession, and, of course, they sat on the ball after two first-down conversions.

THE REV. CHARLES C. KEYES Cedar Rapids The Rev. Charles C. Keyes, 95, of Cedar Rapids, Iowa, went home to be with his Lord and Savior on Thursday, Nov. 26, 2020. A private service will be held Wednesday, Dec. 2, at Cedar Memorial Park Chapel of Memoires. Burial will follow at Cedar Memorial Park Cemetery. A livestream for this service can be viewed at client.tribucast.com/tcid/90996235 at 11 a.m. Wednesday, Dec. 2. As mandated by proclamation, social distancing must be practiced. The use of face masks or shields is required. Charles was born April 30, 1925, in Cedar Rapids, to Charles Keyes and Laurana Colson. He married Lillian Caperonis on Dec. 25, 1946. She preceded him in death in 2015. Charles enlisted in the U.S. Navy in March 1943, and served three years on the destroyer, the USS Satterlee (DD-626). He was an ordained minister in the Church of the Nazarene and pastored several churches in Iowa from 1950 until 1968. He moved to Cedar Rapids in 1968 and worked at Weyerhaeuser Corp. until his retirement in 1992. Charles' passion in life was serving Christ and loving his church family. He loved visiting people and spent many days with the sick, visiting the home bound or just having coffee with a friend. He never was able to leave their home without offering a word of encouragement and a prayer, a blessing we will all miss in the coming days. Charles was a true man of God and it is fitting he left this earth on Thanksgiving Day to join his Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, where he can thank Him for all of eternity. In lieu of flowers, memorial donations may be made to the First Church of the Nazarene in Cedar Rapids. Online condolences may be directed to the family at www.cedarmemorial.com under obituaries.

Owing to their sluggish start, the Bluebirds already find themselves seven points off the play-off spots and 11 away from the automatic promotion places.
 Given the strength of this City squad, they would not have expected to be this far off the pace this early on.
 However, if Saturday's dominant display is the sign of things to come, and with the fixtures coming thick and fast, Cardiff have a real opportunity to gain some ground in the coming weeks and challenge near the top of the table.
 It is a squad, on paper at least, which is more than capable of achieving promotion to the Premier League. They have given themselves something of an uphill task with their slow start, but Ojo believes the club belongs in the top flight and the players will scrap all season to get there.

Beloved wife, mother, (great) grandmother, aunt and friend, passed away peacefully at the age of 93 on Wednesday, November 25, 2020 in Keswick, Ontario. Phyllis is predeceased by her parents Florence Lee Whiting (née Barlow) and George Lee Whiting, her brother Dr. Graham Lee-Whiting, as well as her daughter Patricia Wilson. She is survived and sadly missed by her husband and best friend, Thomas Wilson, her children Tim, Terry, Ron and Susan along with all her grandchildren (Chris, Keli, Tom, Rob, Jim, Matthew, Kate, Jesse, Leah) and many great-grandchildren, along with her dear cousins, nieces, nephews, and friends. As well, Phyllis was very fortunate to have caregivers, Sheila, Carolyn, Mary Ellen, Sunary, Heike, Fiona and Frank, who in her last years and final days were of great comfort. Phyllis, who grew up in Iroquois Falls, was a farmerette during World War II and helped ensure food was on the tables of families across Ontario during wartime. Phyllis met Thomas Wilson when he was stationed in Iroquois Falls with the Canadian Army at a prison facility for German soldiers. They married on Valentine's Day in 1948 and were together for 72 years. Their enduring love for each other was an inspiration to all who knew them. Phyllis and Tom went on many great adventures together, spending winters in Florida with their friends at Rambler's Rest Resort in Venice, traveling across the continental United States to participate in square dancing and round dancing events, visiting national parks and spending time with family in British Columbia. They also had some wonderful trips, including Alaska, Hawaii, and England. Through their journeys they met many wonderful people who became their very close friends. Phyllis was a very intelligent, gracious, loving, generous family woman and friend, with a gentle soul and quiet determination to accomplish whatever she set out to do. She was an active member of Christ Church Anglican, Roches Point, coordinating and volunteering at countless Church activities over the years including the Women's Auxiliary and Junior Auxiliary. Phyllis was the office manager for the family-owned mechanic shop, T. W. Wilson Services Ltd., an auto repair shop and gas station, for almost 50 years. She was known and admired for her bookkeeping prowess, and a whiz at changing oil, checking tires, or serving her customers' gas. Phyllis had many talents, including playing the piano beautifully, sewing clothes and bedding for her family, and playing and winning countless card games with family and friends. As a child she was quite an athlete, winning countless trophies for track and field, and she enjoyed playing broomball as an adult in the Keswick Women's League. Phyllis' wit was infamous among family, as she was a genius card player who knew the rules better than anyone else and was an excellent strategist. Phyllis was always quick to lend a hand, an ear, or a witty joke to bring some laughter to whomever needed it. Phyllis made everyone she met feel special and loved. Her warmth and kindness will always be with us because love, true love, lasts forever. A private family funeral was held at the M.W. Becker Funeral Home, Keswick, Ontario on Monday, November 30, 2020. Interment took place at Christ Church Cemetery, Roches Point, Ontario.

Mohsen Fakhrizadeh
 Informes contradictorios
 Las agencias de noticias iraníes ofrecieron relatos contradictorios sobre cómo se desarrolló el ataque.
 Un informe publicado el domingo por Fars News dijo que Fakhrizadeh viajaba con su esposa el viernes en un automóvil a prueba de balas, junto a tres vehículos del personal de seguridad, cuando escuchó lo que sonaron como balas golpeando un vehículo y salió del automóvil para determinar qué había sucedido.
 Cuando salió del vehículo, una ametralladora a control remoto abrió fuego desde un vehículo Nissan detenido a unos 150 metros del automóvil de Fakhrizadeh, dijo Fars News.
 Fakhrizadeh recibió al menos tres disparos, según Fars News. Su guardaespaldas también recibió un disparo. Después de los disparos, el Nissan explotó, informó Fars News, que agregó que el ataque duró tres minutos.
 CNN no puede confirmar de forma independiente la versión de los hechos de la agencia de noticias.
 La semioficial Agencia de Noticias de Estudiantes Iraníes (ISNA) también informó que el automóvil de Fakhrizadeh fue alcanzado por disparos, seguido de una explosión y más disparos, citando al ministro de Defensa iraní, Brig. Gen. Amir Hatami.
 Comparación con atentado a Soleimani
 «Según los informes recibidos de miembros de su destacamento de seguridad, el vehículo del Sr. Fakhrizadeh fue inicialmente blanco de disparos, después de lo cual un vehículo Nissan cargado con explosivos se hizo estallar muy cerca de ellos mientras continuaban los disparos contra su vehículo». dijo Hatami, según ISNA.
 Los argumentos de EE.UU. para autorizar el ataque contra Qasem Soleimani
 IRIB, la televisión estatal iraní, dijo que la explosión ocurrió primero, seguida de disparos de los atacantes.
 Seyed Kamal Kharrazi, el jefe del Consejo Estratégico de Relaciones Exteriores de Irán, comparó el asesinato con el atentado contra Qasem Soleimani, informó el domingo la agencia estatal de noticias de la República Islámica. Soleimani, el líder de la Fuerza Quds del Cuerpo de la Guardia Revolucionaria Islámica, murió en un ataque con aviones no tripulados estadounidenses a principios de este año en Iraq.
 «Sin duda, la República Islámica de Irán dará una respuesta calculada y decisiva a los criminales que se llevaron al mártir Fakhrizadeh», dijo Kharrazi, según fue citado.
 Fakhrizadeh era el jefe del centro de investigación de nueva tecnología en la élite de la Guardia Revolucionaria y una figura destacada en el programa nuclear de Irán.

Istanbul's Besiktas won against city rivals Fenerbahce 4-3 in Sunday's Turkish Super Lig derby to end their 15-year-jinx in Kadikoy. Visitors Besiktas last beat Fenerbahce in the Yellow Canaries' home, the Ulker Stadium on April 17, 2005. On Sunday Besiktas drew the first blood in the minute of 4 as Cameroonian forward Vincent Aboubakar scored with a vicious left footed strike in the area to beat Fenerbahce goalkeeper Altay Bayindir. The Black Eagles doubled the gap in the 20th minute as Aboubakar netted with a header. Aboubakar was unmarked. Fenerbahce forward Papiss Demba Cisse narrowed the gap to one with a close range finish in the 34th minute. Besiktas led the first half 2-1. Besiktas forward Cyle Larin was sent off in the minute of 50 over a foul against Fenerbahce right back Gokhan Gonul. The Black Eagles had to play with 10-men in the majority of the second half. Turkish midfielder Necip Uysal made it 3-1 for Besiktas, scoring a header. Fenerbahce midfielder Ozan Tufan made the score 2-3 in the minute of 68 with a close range shot. The Black Eagles' Fabrice N'Sakala scored the fourth goal for Besiktas on a quick counter attack in the 88th minute. Georges-Kevin N'Koudou was the mastermind behind the goal, assisting after a mazing run in the right flank. In the injury time, Fenerbahce were awarded penalty after a Video Assistant Referee (VAR) review. Fenerbahce's Senegalese winger Mame Thiam was fouled in the area. Ozan converted the penalty successfully. But Besiktas secured the 4-3 win in the derby. Aboubakar scored two goals against Fenerbahce to be a key player for Besiktas victory. Sunday's derby was played behind closed doors amid the coronavirus pandemic. Besiktas increased their points total to 16 in nine matches played to be placed fourth, while Fenerbahce stayed at third place with 20 points, they played 10 matches. Galatasaray, currently in second spot in standings, have 20 points as well. The Super Lig is currently led by Aytemiz Alanyaspor, who have 23 points in nine matches.

TORINO (ITALPRESS) - E' giunta a conclusione l'operazione "Molosso" della Guardia di finanza, che ha riguardato gare truccate per 3,5 milioni, frodi nelle pubbliche forniture e corruzione all'interno delle Asl piemontesi.   Sequestrati beni per quasi 300.000 euro, eseguite 15 ordinanze di custodia cautelare personale nei confronti di pubblici dipendenti, commissari di gara ed agenti e rappresentanti di alcune imprese accusati, a vario titolo, di corruzione, turbativa d'asta e frode nelle pubbliche forniture. L'operazione aveva avuto un'accelerazione a maggio con una serie di perquisizioni, a seguito dell'accertamento di un ammanco, presso l'Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria "Citta della Salute e della Scienza di Torino", per un valore di circa trecento mila euro, di un costoso prodotto farmaceutico, denominato "Bon Alive". Un dipendente infedele apponeva firme false di altri infermieri, per il reintegro delle giacenze. Nel proseguo dell'inchiesta e emerso un collaudato ed articolato sistema di interazioni fra soggetti privati e commissari di gara finalizzato a truccare le gare d'appalto attraverso la modifica dei relativi capitolati, l'attribuzione di punteggi di favore e la rivelazione di informazioni riservate. Nel mirino della Procura della Repubblica e dei militari della Guardia di Finanza sono finite, in particolare, tre gare bandite: dalla "Citta di Torino" - ASL TO4, per la fornitura di camici chirurgici sterili monouso; dalla A.O.U. Maggiore della Carita di Novara, per la fornitura di distributori di "divise e giacche in TNT"; dalle ASL di Asti e di Alessandria, nonche dall'Azienda Ospedaliera SS Antonio e Biagio e C. Arrigo di Alessandria, per la fornitura di prodotti ed apparecchiature chemioterapiche.   (ITALPRESS).
