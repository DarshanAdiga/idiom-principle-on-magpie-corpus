Less than a year later, the team responsible for the CT6 was let go as part of a huge GM restructuring. The CT6, which had debuted for the 2016 model year, was canceled, with production ending in February 2020. Only 800 cars were built with the Blackwing V-8. Cadillac has no plans to put it in anything else, and that was the case before the coronavirus made an indelible mark on the auto industry.  Why did Cadillac go through the effort to create an all-new engine only to abandon it in such short order? This wasn't the original plan. We contacted several people who were deeply involved with the Blackwing project, all of whom agreed to speak on condition of anonymity, to understand why this ambitious project came to such a sudden demise.           Twenty years ago, General Motors decided it was time for Cadillac to move upmarket and finally present a real challenge to the German luxury-car establishment. By the early 2010s, that meant a big, opulent sedan. At the time, the Alpha platform was brand-new, slated for the upcoming ATS and the third-generation CTS, as well as the sixth-generation Chevrolet Camaro. But the new full-size Cadillac wouldn't share a platform with lesser models. It would use its own front-engine, rear- or all-wheel drive architecture, appropriately named Omega.  This is where Johan de Nysschen, best known for a long and successful tenure leading Audi of America, entered the picture. De Nysschen is refreshingly outspoken among auto executives and is familiar with controversy. Cadillac poached the South African-born executive from Infiniti in 2014, where his lasting contribution seems to be a widely panned name change for all the brand's cars. Soon after his arrival at Cadillac, de Nysschen announced huge shifts. He created a $12 billion plan to go after the German establishment and expand Cadillac's domain beyond the American and Chinese markets where it made most of its sales. He also announced the brand's business headquarters would move from Detroit to New York City, a decision he later explained had been in the works before he arrived.                   *[ON]: Ontario

QUINCY -- Nicole Crispo sees a lot in the city clerk's office. From birth to death -- literally -- her office oversees the major moments in the lives of Quincy residents. But her favorite? Weddings.
 "It is the absolute best part of my job," she said. "Followed closely by meeting all the babies who come in with their parents to file birth certificates."
 The coronavirus pandemic has wrecked havoc on wedding plans nationwide and many have chosen to postpone or give up elaborate ceremonies. For the last few months, only those with special circumstances have been able to go through with marriage ceremonies at city hall, but that changed as precautions started to lift last week.
 "We're getting this huge influx of people from all over the South Shore who want to get married," Crispo said. "The Boston clerk's office is completely booked and we're the only ones in the area open for weddings."

 Between March 18 and last Monday, Crispo only facilitated weddings for first responders, military members or those who had wedding licenses set to expire.
 But now, the clerk's office has been turned into a COVID-friendly space for couples of all kinds to get hitched.
 "Everybody wants to do it and I feel bad saying no to people," she said. "This probably isn't what most couples had in mind . . . I'm happy to do it. I'm happy to help them. The important thing is that they just want to be married."
 Those who are filing a notice of intent to marry are directed to a small table at a secluded end of a short hallway. Couples are allowed to make intention appointments -- where a pair fills out marriage paperwork -- every 30 minutes and the area is disinfected between each appointment.
 On the day of the wedding, which is also by-appointment only, couples are led into Crispo's office. The pair are allowed to remove their masks for the ceremony and Crispo stands at the opposite end of the room to follow the six- foot-distance rule.
 During the height of the pandemic, no guests were allowed in the room, but Crispo said those restrictions are easing slightly, provided that witnesses are wearing masks and standing six feet away.
 Usually, Crispo said an average of four couples come to the office each week. But just last Friday, 13 couples filled out intention paperwork and another eight were married.
 "I guess this puts things into perspective," she said. "When something like this happens, you realize the cocktail hour wasn't the most important thing -- being married is."
 On Monday afternoon, two couples were married at Quincy City Hall.
 Ekechat Mello, who married David Mello of Quincy, clutched a purple bouquet and wore a beaded headpiece and long white gown to the ceremony. Her father and sister wore masks as they looked on, and everyone cheered as the couple said "I do."
 Ekechat Mello said they didn't have a big wedding planned before the coronavirus, and decided to go ahead and get married rather than start planning while large gatherings are still banned. The pandemic also kept David's parents, who are higher-risk, from attending the ceremony, but they're hoping to hold a celebratory party in the fall.
 "We've been talking about it for a few months and we really love each other, so we thought it was as good a time as any," David Mello said.
 Crispo said there are several more ceremonies slated for later this week. She expects the rush to continue until more clerk's offices open again.
