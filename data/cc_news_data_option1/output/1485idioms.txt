As Brazil look to put their World Cup woes behind them, hosts Chile are among the fancies to win the Copa America.
 Led by Arsenal forward Alexis Sanchez, Jorge Sampaoli's Chile will be strong contenders on home soil.
 Chile have never won the Copa, finishing runners-up on four occasions, but have high hopes this could be the year to put that right ahead of their opening game of the tournament against Ecuador on Thursday.
 With Sanchez, Arturo Vidal, Claudio Bravo and Jorge Valdivia among their squad – they have no shortage of star quality and have emerged as a real force to be reckoned with.
 While Sampaoli's team come into the tournament approaching their peak, Brazil are in a period of transition after the misery of their embarrassing 7-1 World Cup semi-final drubbing at the hands of Germany on home soil.
 Defender and former captain Thiago Silva went as far as to say that the Copa may have come too soon for the five-time world champions.
 They have at least shown improvement under Dunga, though, winning nine straight games since a 3-0 defeat to Netherlands in the third-place at the World Cup.
 In that time, the eight-time Copa champions have kept seven clean sheets.
 Advancing from Group C is the minimum expectation for Brazil, who will come up against Colombia, Peru and Venezuela.
 World Cup runners-up Argentina are 14-time winners, just one fewer title than defending champions Uruguay, and it would no surprise if they claimed a 15th title.
 For an ageing group, it may be their last chance to lift a major trophy – and coach Gerardo Martino knows as much.
 "They realise that time is running and their possibilities of winning a title with the national team are disappearing," he said.
 "It's a great moment, I wish we can take advantage of it."
 With a strike force that includes Lionel Messi, Sergio Aguero, Carlos Tevez and Gonzalo Higuain, expect Argentina to be among the more entertaining teams.
 They are grouped with Uruguay, who are without suspended talisman Luis Suarez, and will also take on Paraguay as well as tournament debutants Jamaica.
 Mexico will also feature and, despite picking a weakened squad due to the upcoming CONCACAF Gold Cup, they will be threatening in Group A against Chile, Ecuador and Bolivia.
 Colombia are dark horses in Group C after their impressive performances at Brazil 2014, where they bowed out in the quarter-finals.
 Chile is ready to put on a show and it will be intriguing to see which South American nation can rise to the occasion.

There were and are many other angles that crafty cyber-criminals have taken, including some of the most heinous and immoral such as peddling fake COVID-19 tests online, and adding insult by nabbing your personal and financial information to sell on the dark web. There's an age-old sentiment about the criminal enterprise, which no reasonable person can deny. If they'd simply apply their entrepreneurship, craftiness, problem-solving and other efforts toward the common good…. But alas. Try to convince the con to change her or his way, eh.
 That's why the next evolution of coronavirus inspired fraud and crime wasn't a great surprise, to me at least. The administration has been throwing everything at this including economic relief. Part of that, as you know, is en route to you! The Treasury is passing out cold, hard cash in the spirit of economic stimulus. Millions more are filing for unemployment benefits, which generally have been made more abundant these days. Lo and behold, cyber- thieves! Two more avenues from which to squeeze ill-gotten gains.
 Around $2 trillion in aid and relief has come into play for businesses and individuals. We were treated to similar emergency relief after the recession of 2008 and 2009, but these techie thieves have evolved greatly since. And, the computing hardware, likewise, is much more advanced.

Colombia striker Carlos Bacca is on the hunt for more silverware as the Copa America draws closer.
 The 44th edition of the Copa America kicks off in Chile next week and Colombia are in action beforehand, with an international friendly against Costa Rica scheduled on Saturday.
 Colombia - pooled in Group C alongside Brazil, Peru and Venezuela for South America's showpiece event - travel to Buenos Aires over the weekend as coach Jose Pekerman runs the rule over his team for the first time since announcing his squad.
 One player set to feature is Bacca, who helped Sevilla to back-to-back UEFA Europa League titles last month.
 Bacca scored twice in the Europa League final and the 28-year-old has now set his sights on international glory in Chile, where 2001 champions Colombia kick-off their campaign against Venezuela on June 14.
 "The season finished very well, achieving our objectives at Sevilla in a very good campaign," Bacca told Copa America's official website.
 "The club's achievements make me more eager to do great things with Colombia.
 "I do not know if it's my best moment, but I feel very good physically and mentally.
 "I am looking forward to contributing to this team and I am only thinking about the Copa America and nothing else."
 Colombia have won six matches on the bounce since suffering back-to-back defeats to Brazil, who eliminated their South American rivals in the quarter- finals of last year's World Cup before prevailing in a friendly two months later.
 Costa Rica - gearing up for July's CONCACAF Gold Cup - have a full squad to choose from, with coach Bryan Ruiz, Keylor Navas, Alvaro Saborio, Joel Campbell, Celso Borges, Junior Diaz, Michael Umana, Roy Miller and Cristian Gamboa all included by Paulo Wanchope.
 Debutant goalkeeper Danny Carvajal is also in the squad, while midfielder Marvin Angulo could make his first international appearance since 2008.
 Costa Rica have played twice in the New Year and have failed to win both times, drawing with Paraguay and losing to Panama in April.

But that success comes with a cost.
  _More than 2.3 million Californians filed for unemployment benefits in the last month_ as businesses closed due to state mandates, and the economy continues to unravel. Some students lost access to free and reduced-cost meals when schools shuttered, and _many have not participated in virtual learning_. The governor’s strategy of distancing residents can also _lead to social isolation_ and increased health risks for the elderly and vulnerable.
 Despite his attempts to quell uncertainty, Newsom has not yet provided a timeline for when the state’s nearly 40 million people can expect to return to work — or move about freely. And to those struggling to make ends meet, that’s the question they want answered most.
 “When are the restrictions going to be lifted?” asked Miguel Tot, who last worked at his job managing a downtown Los Angeles restaurant on March 16. “There’s no timetable on that, so I have no idea, you know, when normality is going to come back.”

Wilson noted the COVID-19 challenges at the jail, where conditions are such that social distancing is nearly impossible and the virus has already infected more than 300 inmates.
 “People are dying in and out of jail,” Wilson said at the hearing. “The courts have done a whirlwind job of trying to get as many people out of the jail as possible, particularly those who are low-level non-violent offenders so they can shelter at home.”
 But before he entered his decision, Wilson said that Baumgartner stands out among those getting relief.
 “This defendant would have easily fit that category, but we are releasing people we think we should be able to trust and that they will do the right thing,” the judge said. “The problem for Mr. Baumgartner is that he has demonstrated time and time and time again that we can not trust him. That he will not come to court.”
 The hearing was noteworthy for other reasons: All parties appeared remotely via videoconference, an effort to prevent the spread of the virus in crowded courtrooms.
 Baumgartner appeared from inside the jail, wearing a surgical mask and appearing to sit behind a desk, leaned into a camera to speak.

Ten years ago it would've taken a great deal of computing power and ingenuity to crack complex passwords. Now, the advanced algorithms push the power of the computer into overdrive to test billions of combinations and permutations of characters before - Bingo! - one hits. What used to take, in cybersecurity parlance, "brute force" to uproot a password now only takes force. We users, as you know quite personally, have not been evolving our passwords' strength and complexity in lock-step. "Password1234" is still one of the most widely used (shaking his head).
 You'll be getting, or already have, an email, for example, appearing at first glance to be from the IRS. It'll give you the "opportunity" to quickly receive the relief funding by "clicking this link" to input your bank's routing number and your account number. You may have read early predictions that stimulus money may take until August, so the temptation will be real. Or, you'll get one from (not) the Kentucky Electronic Workplace for Employment Services to help you along the unemployment process; help you, to help the criminal that is.
 These worst-of-the-predators are double dipping, to boot, because after they snag your stimulus or unemployment dollars they'll turn your personal and banking information over to the wolves in the dark web. Sure enough, the first strike is derailing your $1,200 stimulus check and then they'll grab a few crumbs, comparatively, by selling a virtual roster of their victims to other fraudsters online.
 What to do. The phrase that comes to mind is "trust but verify." I can't, here, illustrate every scenario, but that spirit should be at work throughout. At the base, you can always simply call the office that sent the email. Unless, that is, your iPhone got hacked along the way.

Philippe Coutinho is confident that Brazil team-mate Roberto Firmino has all the attributes to succeed in the Premier League and is itching to link up with him at Liverpool.
 Firmino completed his move to Anfield from Hoffenheim earlier this week in a deal that is reported to eventually be worth £29million.
 With Liverpool having forked out such a hefty fee, the pressure will be on to produce from the off and Coutinho - who is currently on Copa America duty with Firmino - has no doubt that the forward will thrive.
 "He is strong physically, he is fast, agile, very skilful on the ball and he scores a lot of goals - he is a great forward. I am sure he will be of great help to us next season," he told Liverpool's official website.
 "After hearing the news, I said to him 'welcome to Liverpool' and I have told him that he will be coming into a club that is like a family - I made sure to tell him that.
 "I have also wished him a great and very successful first season at Liverpool."
 Liverpool have moved quickly in the transfer market as they seek to return to the UEFA Champions League next season, with Firmino joining James Milner, Danny Ings, Adam Bogdan and Joe Gomez at Anfield.
 And Coutinho believes Liverpool are in a strong position to challenge for honours next term.
 "I'm very much looking forward to playing and starting the new season alongside Firmino at Liverpool," he added.
 "I am looking forward to not only playing for Liverpool again, but trying to help us get into a position to win trophies.
 "As I said, I am very happy he has signed for Liverpool - but not only him, all of the other signings we've made recently as well. I'm sure all of these new players are coming in to make our team even stronger for the new season.
 "I can't wait to start the Premier League season. I am very hopeful things will go well for us on the pitch this season."

With Kenya set to take on Congo in Sunday's Africa Cup of Nations qualifier, head coach Bobby Williamson has opted to rest a number of his squad who play domestically.
 Both sides open their Group E campaigns in Brazzaville, hoping to make an ideal start on the road to Gabon 2017.
 Kenya have not made it to the finals since 2004, when they exited at the first round, while Congo reached the last eight of this year's competition, held in Equatorial Guinea.
 Coming into the clash on the back of a 2-0 friendly win over South Sudan last weekend, Kenya coach Williamson has left some notable names out of his squad for this encounter.
 Kenyan Premier League top scorer Victor Ali Abondo is among those not included, but former Uganda boss Williamson has explained his reasons.
 "We have another match in a week's time after Sunday so we have to balance the team because against Ethiopia [in a friendly], we will not have any of the players who are based outside the country," he said.
 Kenya goalkeeping coach Matthew Omino, who also works for domestic league leaders Gor Mahia, is well aware of the quality of Sunday's opponents.
 Many of the Congo squad play for AC Leopards, who knocked Gor Mahia out of the CAF Champions League back in April.
 "A bulk of the Congo team is from AC Leopards who we played against in the continental stage," he told Futaa.com.
 "They have good players but we showed them too much respect and that proved costly at the end.
 "Gor Mahia played well against AC Leopards and even the fans gave us a standing ovation after the game. If we can maintain focus for the entire duration of the match we can manage a positive result."
 Congo, led by wily veteran Claude Le Roy, will be without Thievy Bifouma, Francis N'Ganga , Marvin Baudry and Delvin N'Dinga.
 ​They were dumped out of this year's edition by their neighbours from the Democratic Republic, and are bidding to reach their second successive finals, having failed to qualify for the previous seven.
