At a time when so much of the nation is divided, I believe there is one thing we can all agree upon: Good riddance to 2020. It’s been a year for the history books. With respect to Medicare, you’ve already seen plenty of changes, starting with the disappearance of Medigap Plan C and Plan F for new Medicare beneficiaries and the introduction of a high-deductible Plan G.
 COVID brought additional changes, including full telemedicine benefits for every Medicare beneficiary. And, in the early days of the pandemic, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) announced COVID testing would be covered at 100 percent and a vaccine, once it becomes available, will be covered with no out-of-pocket costs.
 With 2021 just around the corner, we’re beginning to get a clearer picture of what’s ahead for Medicare in the coming year. From new plans to new premiums, here are some of the Medicare changes you need to know.

State-owned plane maker Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) on Monday announced that it has kicked off a crucial developmental test of a jet trainer that was planned as a replacement for the Indian Air Force's ageing Kiran aircraft fleet. The spin flight testing of the much-delayed Sitara intermediate jet trainer (IJT) --- or the HJT-36 single-engine aircraft --- is being seen as a developmental milestone even though there is no indication from the IAF about a possible order. The IJT project is running late by several years."The spin testing of an aircraft is the most crucial phase of its flight testing. The testing will be gradually progressed to assess the behaviour of the aircraft till six turn spins to either side to meet the targeted requirement," the HAL said in a statement. HAL test pilots Group Captain HV Thakur (retd) and Wing Commander P Avasti (retd) conducted the tests on Monday. Spin is a manoeuvre an aircraft gets into on its own when its controls are mishandled. Spin testing seeks to prove that the IJT can do a spin and recover safely from it, experts said. During the first flight test, the aircraft was taken through one turn spin to the left and right to test the spin characteristics, HAL said. Rookie pilots in IAF go through a three-stage training involving the Pilatus PC-7 MkII planes, Kiran trainers and finally the Hawk advanced jet trainers before they can fly fighter jets. As the Kirans are approaching the end of their service life, some amount of stage-2 training is already being done on the PC-7.Experts doubted if the IAF would order the IJT as it was a case of "too little, too late."The delay in the IJT programme, conceived more than two decades ago, has upset the IAF's calculations, officials said. The project was sanctioned in July 1999 with a grant of Rs 180 crore. The IJT, first powered by a French engine and now a Russian one, was expected to get initial operational clearance by 2006 with deliveries to the IAF planned a year later. HAL said the IJT has been redesigned for the spin test "by moving the vertical tail aft and extending the rudder surface." "These changes (made) for ensuring satisfactory spin behaviour required extensive redesign of the rear fuselage and the rudder. The changes have been incorporated in two aircraft with the involvement and clearance from certification agencies at every stage," the statement said. After being modified, the two aircraft underwent significant flight tests to assess the general handling with the new configuration of fin and rudder, and the jets have been incorporated with the necessary safety devices (anti-spin parachute systems), it said. Meanwhile, the IAF plans to buy the basic trainer aircraft from HAL to train rookie pilots. The defence ministry, in August, gave its go- ahead to the purchase of 106 Hindustan Turbo Trainer-40 (HTT-40) aircraft from HAL to provide a push to the government's Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan' (self- reliant India movement).

As Liszewski mentioned, her mother's death followed that of both her husband and her brother. Her brother Tom passed away on June 17, Janie confirmed to her fans in a social media post. His death had also been met with an outpouring of support from her followers, with Liszewski returning to social media a few days later to express her thanks "to each and every one of you for all the kind and lovely words during this very sad, confusing and emotional time."


  Less than four months later, Liszewski's husband, the legendary guitarist and Van Halen band member, died following a battle with cancer. The couple had married in 2009 after several years of dating. Van Halen died on the morning of Oct. 6 of throat cancer, with Liszewski breaking her silence just a day later, writing that her "heart and soul have been shattered into a million pieces." At the time, Liszewski said that she "never knew it was possible to cry so many tears or feel such incredible sadness."

This report provides an in-depth assessment of the global structured data, big data and telecom analytics markets, including a study of the business drivers, application use cases, vendor landscape, value chain analysis, case studies and a quantitative assessment of the industry from 2020 to 2025.      Big data tools help communications service providers gain deeper insights into customer behavior, including usage patterns, preferences, and interests. While hard to derive quick and meaningful insights, big data solutions provide carriers insights into relationships, family, work patterns and location. This is increasingly achieved in real-time using both structured and unstructured data.      The term big data refers to a massive volume of both structured and unstructured data that is so large that it is difficult to process using traditional database and software techniques. While the presence of such datasets is not something new, the past few years have witnessed immense commercial investments in solutions that address the processing and analysis of big data.      Big data opens a vast array of applications and opportunities in multiple vertical sectors including not limited to retail and hospitality, media, utilities, financial services, healthcare and pharmaceutical, government and homeland security and the emerging industrial internet vertical. With access to vast amounts of datasets, telecom companies are also turning out to be major proponents of the big data movement. big data technologies, and in particular their analytics abilities offer a multitude of benefits to network operators which include improving subscriber experience, building and maintaining smarter networks, reducing churn and even the generation of new revenue streams.      Big data and analytics have emerged as a potential source of revenue for telecom operators, at a time when carriers have been feeling the pressure to generate new sources of revenue. One of those sources comes from their ability to mine the huge amount of data they generate or have access to in both their customer base and their networks. The two have emerged as the tools to help analyze and manage this information. There are now many analytical and intelligence tools that enable mobile operators to understand customer and network behavior.      Communications service providers have a rich stream of data, especially those that offer telephony, TV and Internet services, the triple play operators. The many sources of data is an advantage for telecom companies, but if they want to monetize that data and derive meaningful, actionable analytics it could be challenging due to the complexities of correlation, prediction, and the massive volumes of data from different sources.      Big data helps telecom providers to get deeper insights into customer behavior, their service usage patterns, preferences, and interests. While hard to derive quick and meaningful insights, big data gives telecom companies an idea of relationships, family, work patterns and accurate location data among others. The publisher of this report believes that this will optimally be performed in real-time using both structured and unstructured data.      In general, the data coming into a telecom service provider could be categorized as 'data' which is the actual content flowing across the network, and 'meta-data', which is the data describing the properties, sources, costs, etc. relating to the content data. In terms of types of data telco data can be divided into two broad categories as structured and unstructured data.

Kardashian seems unbothered in light of reports that ex Scott Disick, with whom she shares kids Mason, 10, Penelope, 8, and Reign, 5, is dating 19-year- old Amelia Hamlin. While _KUWTK_ fans were convinced it was Kardashian and Disick who were feeling the love after the two spent month posting flirty comments and photos on Instagram following his split from Sofia Richie in May, the Talentless founder, 37, has been spotted getting cozy with the teenage daughter of Lisa Rinna and Harry Hamlin numerous times over the past two months.


  The pair was first spotted together stepping out for a Halloween party on Oct. 31, and last week were spotted wrapped in each other's arms while walking along the beach in Santa Barbara. Hamlin even shared an Instagram Story over the weekend at a dinner in Disick's honor, with the personalized menu in sight. An insider told _Us Weekly_ that despite their 18-year age difference, Disick and Hamlin "hit it off right away" and are "dating around and having fun," but that their relationship is "nothing serious at the moment."


  Another source told _The Sun_ that Hamlin's _Real Housewives of Beverly Hills_ star mother is "worried" about her new beau's "baggage," adding, "Lisa isn't going to acknowledge this publicly for now because she's still trying to wrap her head around it and thinks this is a phase. But when she does speak about it, she'll keep her cool but really, she's worried." Much of Rinna's concern reportedly comes from her daughter's own mental health issues, including a long struggle with anorexia she has been open about for years now. The source explained that she and her husband were concerned about someone with "so much baggage [being] with their baby girl, especially given Amelia's own mental health issues."

The mortal remains of former Assam chief minister Tarun Gogoi, who passed away on Monday at the age of 84, will be cremated in Guwahati on Thursday, state Congress chief Ripun Bora said during a press briefing.
 Bora further said that Gogoi's body will be taken to his official resident at Dispur on Tuesday morning from the Gauhati Medical College and Hospital, where the veteran Congress leader breathed his last.
 "The doctors will complete necessary medical formalities in the night to prepare the body for keeping it safe for three days," PTI quoted Bora as saying. Gogoi's body will be then taken to state secretariat Janata Bhawan where he sat for 15 years as the chief minister of Assam. At around 3.30 pm, he will be taken to state Congress headquarters Rajiv Bhawan.
 Gogoi, a three-time chief minister of Assam, was undergoing medical treatment at the Gauhati Medical College and Hospital for post-Covid-19 complications when he breathed his last on Monday evening. He had tested positive for coronavirus in August. Gogoi's family has requested Assam chief minister to let people pay their last respect to the leader.
 "Gogoi's wife Dolly and son Gaurav requested Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal to keep his body for one day for the public. As per the family's wish, the government will take the body to the Srimanta Sankardeva Kalakshetra complex in Guwahati on Tuesday evening and it will be there for the whole day on November 25," Bora added.
 Gogoi's last journey on November 26 will start from Kalakshetra and his cremation ceremony will be held in Guwahati, Bora stated. "As per Gogoi's last wish, the body will be taken to a temple, mosque and church before the last rites," he said.
 Bora also informed that many political leaders from Congress such as Rahul Gandhi are expected to visit Assam over the next few days to pay their last respect to the late veteran leader.

About a week after the Culpeper County Planning Commission recommended that Maroon Solar's application to construct a 1,000-acre solar farm off Raccoon Ford Road be denied, the company pulled its application seeking a permit for the project.
 Bruce McLeod, vice president of Maroon Solar’s parent company, denied to say why the application was pulled. In Maroon Solar’s letter of withdrawal, attorney John Foote states that the company appreciates the time county has staff has dedicated to the project and “we anticipate being in contact with you further about this project.”
 County Administrator John Egertson noted that Maroon Solar can re-apply for the project at any time “but it will be treated as a brand new application, starting from square one, if they do decide to reapply.”
 Maroon Solar, a subsidy of the North Carolina-based Strata Solar, hoped to construct a 149-megawatt solar project located near Raccoon Ford Road. The firm’s plans called for the installation of solar panels on about 960 of the site’s 1,700 acres.
 Reasons the planners recommended denial of the permit included the proposed size of the solar farm and that the project does not fall in line with the county’s comprehensive plan. With county guidelines stating that solar farms should not exceed 300 acres, the proposal more than quintupled that land-use policy.
 Shortly after the commission recommended denial, Strata Solar developer Louis Iannone said the company was disappointed and “we heard their comments and are working hard to address the issues raised. We continue to believe our proposed solar project is good for Culpeper County.”
 Had the application not been pulled, the Board of Supervisors would have considered the request.
 To even have a chance for the Planning Commission to recommend approval, Planning Director Sam McLearen said that Maroon Solar would have to reduce the size and scale of the project. Other concerns, he said, included stormwater erosion, the impact of construction on nearby roads and potential noise associated with blasting work.
