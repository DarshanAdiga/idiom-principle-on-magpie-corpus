"You always want to be in that best team. That's all I've ever tried to do and it's the same with Stuart. But we've got six or seven world-class bowlers in this group, so we're making sure that everyone's in the right place, and the right frame of mind to go out and bowl their best for England if called upon," he added.

"He's certainly the best allrounder I've ever played with and he's becoming the best allrounder that England's ever had. There's no reason why he can't go on to become even better.

But I'd like to think that, if we're in a situation where we're both fit and England are picking their strongest bowling attack, we both be in that."
