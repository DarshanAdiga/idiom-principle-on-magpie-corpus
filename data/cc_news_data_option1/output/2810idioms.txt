As a child, Kathryn Johnson ate what any typical '80s or '90s kid ate. Like Hot Pockets.
   
 Now, she and her family buy directly from an Oklahoma ranch that sells beef, chicken and pork, and partners with other local farms to provide dairy products, honey, bread and produce. The farm-to-table supply chain allows the Johnsons to bypass the traditional grocery store for many of their foods.
   
 "It's kind of a one-stop shop for all of your local food items, and they will deliver it to your door," Johnson said. "I just order online and the next day it's on my porch. It's pretty awesome."
   
 Johnson doesn't live in rural Oklahoma, where the beef is plentiful to neighboring farm families. She lives in suburban Tulsa, and is one of a growing number of people who buy directly from producers.
   
 "I've always valued food that doesn't have a bunch of added junk in it," she said. "And I've also valued small, local farms and knowing where our food comes from."
   
 Demand meets technology
   
 The availability of direct-to-consumer food isn't a new idea, but the integration of technology and a widening base of health-conscious consumers has allowed the niche market to expand. The United States Department of Agriculture reported last year direct-to-consumer agriculture sales more than doubled between 2012 and 2017, reaching a total of $2.8 billion.
   
 "There is a huge demand for direct beef," said Janissa Bennett, manager of Edmond-based Grazeland and Cattle LLC. "People want to know where their meat's coming from and what practices are being used."
   
 Bennett has had a ranch for eight years and started selling calves in 2016. She and her husband only recently entered the direct beef business, however, and went digital with their sales. They made an account with AgBoost Marketplace, a direct-to-consumer platform launched by the Oklahoma City-based tech startup that offers digital herd management tools and other services, in order to increase revenues.
   
 "The low prices at the sale barn are just not cost-effective for us to put all that work into them and then sell them at the sale barn," Bennett said.
   
 AgBoost Marketplace allows ranchers the ability to market live animals along with the data that has been collected on those animals to interested buyers. Product and service providers may also list and sell products to potential customers.
   
 The Oklahoma Cattlemens Association partnered with AgBoost to improve their direct sales database and make it easier for consumers to find local producers willing and able to sell meat by the cut.
   
 Michael Kelsey, executive vice president for association, said that within a day of issuing a recent list of direct-to-consumer options, many members reported selling out of their stock.
   
 "The new searchable list is a win for the consumer, the beef producer and for AgBoost when producers take advantage of this cutting-edge app," OCA President Mike Weeks said.
   
 Connecting producer and consumer is exactly what AgBoost wants.
   
 "We would like to provide an interactive and efficient way for our users to easily look up, research and initiate contact with providers," said Mark Tague, vice president of sales and marketing for AgBoost, a company that participated in the Thunder Launchpad accelerator program.
   
 Bennett already heard from potential customers wanting cuts of beef, but Oklahoma-certified butchers are so backed up with product that the earliest she'll be able to sell is February.
   
 In the meantime, she's raising steers on a grain program to get them up to around 1,200 pounds, an optimal weight for processing.
   
 Changing business model
   
 On his ranch near Norman, Jake Calvert typically raised beef to sell in large quantities, either a whole or half of the animal. Calvert said the marketplace enlightened him enough to make changes to his business model at JSJ Cattle & Quarter Horses.
   
 For years, Calvert advertised with hats, business cards, calendars and word of mouth.
   
 "I never uttered the words 'digital footprint' until the first of May 2020," he said.
   
 The large-portion customers were usually yearly repeats, he said, and he built his business on offering about a dozen calves a year. But when the online marketplace opened, he started hearing from more and more people interested in buying smaller cuts.
   
 Now, he gets dozens of emails and calls each week.
   
 "We went from 15 (calves) a year to 23 this year," Calvert said. "I think we already have 26 contracted for next year, and we're exploring a buy-by-the-cut program as opposed to the halves and wholes only."
   
 Opening up his business to smaller portions direct to consumers and restaurants will diversify his business and shelter him from wide swings in the market.
   
 "There is a tremendous amount of interest from small, individual mom-and-pop diners and restaurants that find it difficult to maintain consistency buying beef from the packers in Dodge City or Kansas City," Calvert said. "They're looking for somebody that has very consistent supply as far as quality and taste, so that their customers can enjoy that, as well."
   
 And if he finds himself with a surplus of ground beef, Calvert said he will donate the excess to local charities that feed the hungry.
   
 The way Johnson sees it, direct-to-consumer food purchases are becoming more popular as attitudes shift more toward knowing where food comes from, and how it's made.
   
 "People are seeing the value in supporting small local businesses and not just feeding big 'whoever.' Now it's become a hip thing," she said. "You're gonna pay on the long end on healthcare, or you're gonna pay on the front end to take care of your body.
   
 "That's a trade-off we're willing to make."

I am always surprised when people imply that my life is easy. I made getting my master's degree look easy. I made obtaining my PhD look easy. I made losing 75 pounds look, you guessed it, easy.
   
 The truth is, very little in my life has felt easy. My education was not easy. If you don't believe me, ask my mom, she will tell you how much I cried. Losing weight was not easy. Don't believe me, ask my husband, he will tell you I cried once because I wanted pizza so badly. The worst part, however, is that I know I make things harder than they need to be. Why? Because I have a very difficult time saying no to anyone. Even if the person asking is someone who I don't particularly like, even if it is the last thing I want to do, I still say yes. It is a big problem in my life because, without fail, I wind up feeling overwhelmed.
   
 The truly sad part is that I know and understand the psychology behind saying no. "Yes" is so easy! "Yes" is open-hearted and kind. "Yes" is celebrated. "No" is the opposite. "No" is the equivalent of dropping a cinder block on someone else's hopes. "No" is never celebrated.
   
 In reality, saying no provides a surge of strength that is unlike any other experience. No is often confused with negativity, but, in fact, does the complete opposite for the naysayer. No helps us grow in maturity and helps us learn to set firm and healthy boundaries. In so many ways, saying no is the greatest gift you can ever give yourself.
   
 Balance is also important. No one can really say no all the time without being a selfish person. Where does one draw the line?
   
 I would like to recommend five situations in which saying yes is psychologically beneficial to you.
   
 When saying yes strengthens your personal values. Let's say you are a Christian, actively involved in your faith. A friendly neighbor, a non- believer, asks you about your church and if he could attend a service with you. This is the perfect example of when saying yes strengthens who you are and what you value most.
   
 When saying yes is not exploiting you. Let's say you are a student, and your slacker classmate keeps asking to copy your notes. In this case, you are not being kind, you are allowing that student to exploit or take advantage of you.
   
 When saying yes strengthens your goals. Let's say you have a hefty commute to your graduate program and the mere idea of driving it daily already exhausts you. A cohort member from your town is also commuting and asks to carpool to share expenses and study time while the other drives. This request strengthens your own goals and is mutually beneficial.
   
 When saying yes enables you to change the course of your life. Let's say that you have a job that you hate, but a friend has a lead at another company that could land you your dream job. Saying yes here is a no-brainer. Saying yes to risk can be very difficult, but nothing worth having ever comes fear-free.
   
 When saying yes prevents serious damage to another person. Sometimes, we really need to say yes simply because another person needs us. Let's say a friend needs a bone marrow transplant to live, and you are a match. This is a situation when a yes is not only desirable, but essential.
   
 Learning when to say no has been one of the biggest challenges in my life. However, having healthy boundaries has strengthened my own mental health. The important thing to remember is to fill your own cup before you pour into another. This will not only keep you happier, but healthier as well!

In clinching his spot in Friday’s finals — where he will duke it out with Nashawtuc Country Club’s Matthew Organisak beginning at 8 a.m. — Maccario began his shot making tirade by carding a combined 2-over par 144 in his two stroke play rounds on Monday and Tuesday.


  He followed that up with a pair of match play wins on Wednesday over Jack Tegan and defending champion Steven DiLisio, respectively. That set the stage for Thursday morning’s quarterfinals, where he snuck past Benjamin Spitz in a match that went the distance. Maccario trailed or was tied for the majority of the match before sealing the win with an eagle putt on 18. Spitz only managed par.


  “It was a battle and I knew it would be,” said Maccario, who stuck a 5-iron from 190 yards out into the wind on 18 to set up a mid-range eagle putt that he dropped in downhill.


  “(Spitz) is one of the best putters I’ve ever seen and we went back and forth all day. It was really a hard fought match and he was an awesome guy to play with.”


  Maccario and Spitz traded wins in seven of the first nine holes and neither player had more than a one-hole lead all day. But a birdie on 17 to square things back up and his eagle on 18 was enough to get the job done.


  After a 30-minute lunch break, Maccario headed back out to the tee for a semifinal match against Brockton’s Matt Parziale, who you may recall competed in the 2018 Masters Tournament. Maccario trailed by as many as three holes early on, but battled back to take the lead on 16 and held strong down the stretch. Despite what the scorecard said, it was a picture perfect shot on 15 to halve the hole that really gave Maccario the confidence he needed to finish strong.


  It wasn’t your typical approach shot or even a chip around the green. Instead, Maccario used the toe of his putter to connect cleanly on a shot off the green that was wedged between the rough and fairway leading up to the hole. The ball rolled smoothly through the fairway and nestled close enough to the pin for a tap in birdie. Parziale two-putted from about 40 feet for birdie to halve the hole.

“Fifteen was probably the best shot of the tournament for me,” he said of the putter trick shot, which he learned from Bradford Country Club owner Kevin Murphy. “I probably had about five yards of fairway to go through and then 10 yards of green and I got it to about a foot.”


  FRANCOEUR BOWS OUT


  While Maccario will represent St. John’s Prep proudly on Friday, it very well could’ve been two former Eagles vying for the cup.


  Chris Francoeur, who shined at the Prep and currently plays at Division 1 University of Rhode Island, nearly came back to win his semifinal bout against Organisak on Thursday before falling just short on the final hole. The reigning Division 1 New England Golfer of the Year trailed by three with four holes to go but won 15, 16 and 17 to set up a do-or-die 18th hole.


  Unfortunately, his tee shot on 18 sailed out of bounds leading to a bogey finish, and Organisak wrapped things up with a birdie.


  “I got to (the 15th hole) and knew I needed to make something happen,” recalled Francoeur who was down three at the time. “I hit two really solid shots into 15 and rolled in like a 20-footer for eagle. That kind of gave me some momentum going forward and on 16 I knocked a wedge to like five feet and made that putt for birdie. On 17 we both missed the green and I hit a really good chip up to a couple of feet.”


  It was anyone’s match to take from there, but his driver off the tee on the par 5 18th sailed out of bounds into the trees.


  “The wind was blowing so hard left to right,” recalled Francoeur. “I aimed at the left side of the fairway and tried to hit a straight ball but the wind took it too far right.”


  Despite bowing out, it was the farthest that Francoeur had ever gone in the Mass. Am and a performance he will look to build off of in next week’s New England Amateur.
