 \"Those who cannot learn from history are doomed to repeat it.\"
 George Santayana's famous words have been paraphrased by many, but the truth of them is obvious. Maybe that's why age is our friend; we have a lot of history to call upon. Hopefully, we learn, grow and do a better job.
 I may have a rather naive assumption that all people aspire to be their best selves. I hold the same truth for our country. It is our collective goal to become the best we can be as a nation. In light of that, here is some fascinating history that corresponds to our current situation with amazing clarity.
 One hundred years ago, in Washington, D.C., protests took place that shook the nation. It was the culmination of a century of hurt and frustration about grave injustices. All of this was taking place in the middle of a pandemic.
 The irony of these parallel events cannot be ignored. The Spanish flu (later to be recognized as having its origins in Camp Funston in Kansas) was sweeping the world. One hundred ninety-five thousand people died in the United States in the month of October 1918 alone, but the worst was yet to come. The second wave was well underway in 1920 during the protesting.
 Eventually, the flu led to the deaths of 675,000 American citizens.
 In the midst of all this, the protesters set up headquarters in Lafayette Park outside the White House. For days they marched on the capitol to bring their cause before Congress and the president. At one point, the peaceful protesters were heckled and attacked by large crowds who resisted their movement. The U.S. Cavalry was called in for crowd control. Many law-abiding demonstrators were arrested and put in jail.
 Does all this sound familiar? These protests were the culmination of 100 years of effort to change the laws of the land. And finally, on Aug. 18, 1920, the 19th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution granted American women the right to vote!
 I am humbled that these women went out on the streets to make sure I had the right to vote, but ashamed that I take it for granted. That event happened just 28 years before I was born; I am the beneficiary of their passion for equal rights.
 Where will we be 28 or 100 years from now? My hope is that we will learn from our history and continually strive to be the best nation we can be.

Keeping in tune with the changing economic environment, the city-based Murugappa Group had reduced its aggregate capital expenditure in group companies by 19.5%, or by ₹390 crore, in the last two financial years.
 The group’s manufacturing entities, however, reduced a loan outstanding of ₹1,540 crore, leading to an improvement in total debt-to-equity ratio to 0.47 from from 0.74.
 The group incurred a capital expenditure of ₹1,610 crore for the last two fiscals against its planned investment of ₹2,000 crore.
 Aggregate capital expenditure programmes towards expansion, debottlenecking, modernising and digital infrastructure facilities across group companies was over ₹1,009 crore during the year.
 “The financial results of 2019-20 reflect the capabilities of the group to face a difficult economic environment and make the required changes in all elements of operations to ensure sustainable business results,” said M.M. Murugappan, group executive chairman.
 “Some of our companies and SBUs have managed to buck the industry trends to achieve higher sales and profitability, while some recorded higher profitability even on the back of flat or lower sales. A few businesses were impacted on both topline and profitability.
 “There was a strong focus on improving cash flows and reducing debt. We have also been prudent in making suitable provisions arising out of economic conditions and the impact of the pandemic,” he said.
 “With the economy locked down for almost the entire first quarter of the financial year 2020-21, most of the businesses in the Group are gearing up to face much tougher challenges in the months ahead. Cash conservation, cost management, technology, digital capability and agility are the key areas that we are focusing on to drive performance,” he added.
 The group posted a 20.4% increase in net profit for the financial year ended March 2020 to ₹3,489 crore, after excluding special provisions
 . The group registered a 3.3% growth in its turnover to ₹38,105 crore while net profit stood at ₹2,946 crore (including the special provisions). Market capitalisation of listed group companies aggregated to ₹46,683 crore.
 In FY21, EID Parry sold 2% stake in its subsidiary Coromandel International Ltd aggregating to ₹368 crore. The proceeds from the sale will be utilized towards reduction of debt. The group also raised capital to the tune of ₹1,200 crore to support the growth in NBFC business. This resulted in increase of capital adequacy to 20.7%.

In April, a consignment of 170,000 PPE kits from China, including donations for the use of health care professionals dealing with COVID-19 sufferers, were tested by the Defence Research and Development Establishment in Gwalior. The results were not good; around 63,000 were found to fall short of the necessary quality deemed appropriate by the DRDE. None of this was good news given orders placed by Indian companies and government bodies for 15 million PPE kits from the PRC that month. As India’s ambassador to China Vikram Misri described at the time, “We are in the process of, or have already completed, contracting for 15 million PPE kits, consisting of gowns, masks, gloves, goggles, etc. and nearly 1.5 million rapid testing kits of all kinds, some of which have already been delivered.”

Andy Murray is hoping of making a return to Grand Slam tennis at both the US and French Open later this year.
 The three-time Grand Slam champion has been out of action since November with a pelvic injury, but will return in an all-British tournament hosted by his brother Jamie Murray this week.
 Murray will face Liam Broady at the National Tennis Centre in Roehampton on Tuesday.
 The Battle of the Brits gives Murray the chance to get some competitive action under his belt ahead of the planned August resumption of the ATP tour before two Grand Slams come in quick succession.
 The US Open is set to take place behind closed doors from 31 August, with the French Open starting on 27 September.
 Some leading players, including Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal, have questioned whether they will head across the Atlantic to play at Flushing Meadows.
 However, Murray is happy to return to New York for his first Grand Slam since the 2019 Australian Open, even if it means limiting the number of his team who can travel with him.
 "Playing the Grand Slams would be my priority," said the Scot. "The schedule is tricky and I understand the reason why it is like that.
 "I don't mind what the situation is, providing it is safe.
 "If I was told I could take one person with me, for example, you can make that work. I'd probably go with a physio and some coaching could be done remotely."
 Murray is yet to draw up a schedule of which events he will play in preparation for the Slams, but is hoping an extended layoff will help his body fully recover from a number of serious injuries.
 The 33-year-old had career-saving hip surgery in 2019, before his latest long- term injury layoff.
 Murray had been planning a return in March before the coronavirus pandemic brought the tour to a halt.
 "My hip has been feeling better for probably the past three or four weeks," he added.
 "Right now, I feel a little bit more confident because I've had more training under my belt, more practice. In March time, I'd only been practising for four or five weeks since I'd had the issues."

El artista canadiense Justin Bieber negó que agrediese sexualmente a una mujer en 2014, que durante el fin de semana le acusó en Twitter y amenazó con tomar acciones legales contra la persona que publicó la acusación.      Este domingo 21-J, Bieber utilizó Twitter para rechazar la acusación lanzada desde una cuenta en esa red social que posteriormente desapareció y en la que una mujer supuestamente llamada Danielle dijo que conoció al cantante canadiense en la ciudad texana de Austin (EE UU) durante una actuación musical.      Según el relato de Danielle, Bieber la invitó junto varias amigas al hotel Four Season el 9 de marzo de 2014. Allí, de acuerdo con  lo escrito por la acusadora, Bieber la agredió sexualmente.      Posteriormente, en otra cuenta de Twitter, una persona llamada Kadi acusó a Bieber de agredirla sexualmente en un hotel de Nueva York en mayo de 2015.      Aunque Bieber, de 26 años, no ha respondido a la segunda acusación, el domingo el artista recurrió a Twitter para refutar con documentos lo narrado por Danielle.      "Normalmente no respondo a esto porque me he enfrentado a acusaciones aleatorias durante toda mi carrera, pero tras tratarlo con mi esposa y equipo he decidido hablar esta noche sobre un tema", dijo inicialmente.      Bieber añadió que "los rumores son rumores", pero el abuso sexual es algo que no se toma "a la ligera" y que "por respeto a tantas víctimas que tienen que enfrentarse a estos problemas de forma cotidiana", quería asegurarse de me que reunía todos los datos "antes de hacer una declaración".      En una serie de tuits, Bieber publicó fotos, artículos de prensa e incluso facturas de hotel para intentar demostrar que es "materialmente imposible" lo que Danielle narró.      Bieber dijo que, por ejemplo, que el 9 de marzo no se alojó en el Four Seasons de Austin como alegó la cuenta de Danielle sino en un AirBnb con la actriz Selena Gómez, entonces su novia.      Y el 10 de marzo se alojó en el hotel Westin de Austin, y mostró el recibo de su estancia en ese establecimiento.      "Toda acusación de abuso sexual debería ser considerada con seriedad y por eso mi respuesta era necesaria. Sin embargo, esta historia es materialmente imposible y por eso trabajaré con Twitter y las autoridades para tomar acciones legales", terminó señalando Bieber.      En su último tuit, Bieber reenvío un mensaje de Cole Sprouse, uno de los actores de la serie de televisión Riverdale y que también fue acusado de agresión sexual junto con otros actores de la serie.      "Las acusaciones falsas hacen un daño tremendo a las víctimas de ataques reales. Además, nunca intentaría silenciar a nadie. Animo a que la gente examine las acusaciones, ya que los eventos detallados eran materialmente falsos", dijo Sprouse.

Furthermore, the demand for non-essential goods such as clothing, apparel, luxury goods, toys, recreational products, etc. have fallen. This decline in sales has reduced the need for packaging and labelling, ushering in a significant downturn in printing operations.

TORONTO - Premier Doug Ford is set to announce whether Ontario's three regions still in Stage 1 of the province's reopening plan can move into Stage 2.


  As of last Friday, the whole province was in Stage 2 except for Toronto, Peel and Windsor-Essex, which had consistently higher numbers of new daily cases.


  Today, provincewide there are 161 new cases of COVID-19 and three more deaths.


  That's the lowest total of new daily cases since late March and brings the province to a total of 33,637 cases, including 2,609 deaths and 28,933 resolved cases.


  About 70 per cent of today's new cases come from the three regions that are still in Stage 1 of the province's reopening plan — Peel reported 44 new cases, Toronto reported 36 and Windsor-Essex reported 32.


  The Windsor-Essex County Health Unit says that 31 of their 32 new cases today come from the agri-farm sector.


  Two migrant workers have died in the region due to COVID-19 since the start of the pandemic and the Haldimand-Norfolk Health Unit is now reporting that a migrant worker in their area has died amid a farm outbreak there.


  The farm currently has 199 infected migrant workers and 18 other people associated with the farm who tested positive for COVID-19, the health unit said.

A significantly fractured Supreme Court on Thursday shot down the Trump administration's efforts to undo the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, concluding that the government's order canceling DACA was "arbitrary and capricious." But the president's efforts also were cold, heartless and counter to the nation's best interests, so it's encouraging that the court allowed the program to continue.
   
 But DACA survived on a technicality. Had the administration taken the time to lay a proper foundation for its impulsive action to withdraw the protections for the Dreamers, this decision could have gone the other way. So as heartening as the court's decision might be, it does not resolve the underlying issue.
   
 DACA is, at best, a temporary solution to a broader problem, and it's one of the more frustrating aspects of our long-running political impasse over immigration reform. Reasonable minds recognize that the Dreamers stand in a unique position not of their own creation, and justice and fairness dictate that they receive some accommodation. Yet DACA, which is a policy decision that is demonstrably susceptible to political vagaries, doesn't do that. It just delays the crafting of a real solution.
   
 The Obama administration crafted DACA in 2012 after a bipartisan proposal in Congress was scuttled by the deep partisan divisions on immigration policy. It provides temporary protections against deportation for people who meet specific criteria based on their arrival and length of residence in the United States, who have led productive lives through jobs or schooling, and who have not had significant run-ins with the law. Most of the Dreamers bear little responsibility for their presence here since they were brought as minor children by parents or guardians.
   
 It would be manifestly unfair, as the anti-DACA folks demand, to uproot them from the only country most of them have ever really known and send them off to places that are not only foreign to them, but where in many instances they don't speak the language. The hardship such deportations would create on people who are Americans in all but legal standing far outweighs any purported gain in hard-line enforcement of immigration laws.
   
 There are other pragmatic reasons for finding a better solution to this problem. Those who qualify for DACA include parents of about 250,000 children born here in the U.S. What purpose is served in disrupting those families or, even worse, forcing parents to leave the country with children who are U.S. citizens? What sense does it make to force American children to pay a penalty for the long-ago misdeeds of their grandparents?
   
 Further, the DACA-eligible folks have been educated here by U.S. taxpayers, contribute to the economy, and play significant roles in their communities. The Center for American Progress estimates that more than 200,000 DACA recipients are essential workers during the coronavirus pandemic. The nation should reward them by kicking them out?
   
 The solution here is clear. An overwhelming majority of Americans, including Republicans, believe the government should leave the Dreamers alone and craft a path to citizenship. That can be done only by Congress. President Donald Trump has been an unreliable figure on this issue, saying at one point that he would support legislation to help the Dreamers, but then holding the issue hostage to his own dreams for a border wall with Mexico. Whether Trump would do the right thing now as he campaigns for reelection is anyone's guess, but Congress should make the effort and force the issue.
   
 At a base level, it's troubling and dysfunctional that a relative handful of xenophobes among Trump's base can in effect block a sensible humanitarian act supported by the vast majority of their fellow citizens. That is the antithesis of a healthy democracy. And in this instance, it has a drastic impact on the lives of people caught up in circumstances created by others. Congress needs to get its act together and take an obvious step in the national interest.

"We continue to stand up both for the independence of our judicial system and Canadian interests and values," the prime minister said. "We work behind the scenes and in public to ensure that everyone understands we will continue to work extremely hard to get these Canadians home."


  Pompeo said the U.S. is deeply concerned by China's decision to formally charge Kovrig and Spavor.


  "These charges are politically motivated and completely groundless. The United States stands with Canada in calling on Beijing for the immediate release of the two men and rejects the use of these unjustified detentions to coerce Canada," Pompeo said in a statement on Monday.


  "Additionally, we echo Canada's call for immediate consular access to its two citizens, in accordance with the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, as China has prohibited such access for almost six months, and the world has no knowledge of the two Canadians' condition."


  Meng, the chief financial officer of Huawei Technologies, is living in luxury Vancouver home while her extradition hearing wends its way through a British Columbia court.


  The United States wants to prosecute Meng for fraud, alleging she lied to banks in Hong Kong about her company's connections with Iran, which could possibly violate U.S. sanctions.


  Last month, the B.C. Supreme Court judge ruled the allegations against Meng could constitute a crime in Canada. That meant Meng's case remains before the court, unresolved.


  Last week, Meng's lawyers accused the Americans of misleading the B.C. court and said they are seeking a stay in the proceedings.

The Trump administration’s decision to remove more than 9,000 troops from Germany by September is part of a dispiriting pattern. It serves little strategic purpose and will be virtually impossible to pull off. News of the proposal provoked the ire of the German government, which wasn’t briefed on it in advance. Given the mutual animosity between Donald Trump and Chancellor Angela Merkel, that appears to have been the point all along.
 The plan would cap the U.S. presence in Germany at 25,000, down from about 35,000 today, which itself is less than half the number stationed in Germany during the height of the Iraq War. With overseas combat missions winding down, the United States depends less heavily on German bases for transporting troops and supplies. Even so, the U.S. Africa Command runs out of Stuttgart, and military assets in Germany remain critical for counterterrorism operations, treating wounded troops and deterring Russia.

Ultimately, this archetypal boyfriend established the most holistic representation of Hilton. With Latsis, she largely negated the _One Night in Paris_ version of herself, to become a caring, loving girlfriend who wasn’t quite ready to settle down. But in an instant, she torched that image — Hilton as a housewife did little to move the needle for her brand — with Niarchos. It’s almost as if Niarchos was the v2.0 of a Greek Shipping Heir experiment, the relationship designed in a lab. Latsis was means-tested and determined to be too boring and conventional. Niarchos was like Latsis on paper, but ultimately, much more volatile — and thus, theoretically able to keep her name in the paper. He trashed hotel rooms, tossed drinks, crashed Hilton’s Bentley and did other things we could gawk at.

  Give the reigns over to these youngsters and we’ll see whether they are made to go the distance in the Premier League, right? Perhaps not.


  Indeed if anything recent matches have shown the downside of putting too much pressure on the young guns. It is ideal for Saka to be given a chance to show what he can do in a new part of the pitch, it is far from ideal for a repositioned teenager to be his side’s sole creative conduit as he was against Brighton.

"Creo que Kim Jong Un debe reírse mucho de esto", dijo Bolton. "Estas cartas que el presidente ha mostrado a la prensa (...) son escritas por algún funcionario" norcoreano.


  "Pero aún así el presidente las ve como evidencia de esa profunda amistad", dijo.


  En su libro, Bolton también critica al presidente surcoreano Moon Jae-in respecto a los encuentros entre Kim y Trump en 2018 en Singapur y 2019 en Hanói, afirmando que la totalidad del proceso era una "creación de Corea del Sur y mucho más ligado a su agenda con vista a la 'unificación' que a una estrategia seria de parte de Kim o de nosotros".


  La presidencia surcoreana lo acusó el lunes de "distorsionar los hechos" y de poner en peligro las futuras negociaciones sobre el programa nuclear de Pyongyang.


  Para Bolton Trump no está apto para ser presidente y espera que sea un mandatario de solo un periodo. Aunque aseguró que no votará por él ni por el candidato demócrata Joe Biden en las elecciones presidenciales de noviembre.


  ##  "La gota que derramó el vaso"


  El libro "The Room Where it Happened" (La habitación donde sucedió) es el retrato que hace Bolton de sus 17 meses junto a Trump como consejero de seguridad nacional, en 2018 y 2019.


  La administración Trump intentó frenar la publicación del libro de Bolton, pero un juez estadounidense se negó el sábado a bloquearlo, al asegurar que ya era muy tarde para emitir una orden al respecto.


  Despedido en septiembre pasado, Bolton dijo sin embargo que había renunciado y que "la gota de agua que derramó el vaso" para él fue que Trump invitara a los talibanes a Camp David durante las negociaciones de paz afganas.


  Su libro, tachado de "pura ficción" por Trump, describe un presidente dispuesto a casi todo por reelegirse incluso solicitar un impulso de China, rival estratégico de Estados Unidos, durante un encuentro con el presidente Xi Jinping en 2019.


  Según Bolton, Trump "suplicó" a su par chino durante las negociaciones comerciales que aumentara las compras de productos agrícolas estadounidenses con el fin de ganar votos en la votación que decidirá su reelección.


  El exconsejero también dio a entender que había fundamentos para destituir al 45° presidente de Estados Unidos, más allá del caso ucraniano, que finalmente concluyó con su absolución en el Congreso.


  Trump fue acusado por "abuso de poder" por la supuesta presión ejercida ante Ucrania para sacar a luz información que perjudicara a Biden.


  Legisladores tanto republicanos como demócratas han criticado a Bolton por publicar su libro, asegurando que en cambio tenía que haber aportado esa información durante el proceso de "impeachment" contra Trump.


  El demócrata Adam Schiff, presidente del comité de Inteligencia de la Cámara de Representantes, dijo a NBC el domingo que Bolton "se imputa a sí mismo por cobardía y avaricia" al elegir lanzar sus acusaciones en un libro.


  El senador Tim Scott dijo el domingo en ABC que habría preferido ver a Bolton "presentarse ante la Cámara bajo juramento y testificar".

Marty Smith is very angry at the incident that happened at Talladega Superspeedway on Sunday. The ESPN NASCAR reporter was on _SportsCenter_ to talk about a noose being found in driver Bubba Wallace's garage, which led to an immediate investigation by NASCAR. Smith believes NASCAR took a step back on Sunday in terms of fighting racial and social injustice in the sport.


  "I feel like a fool. I just told you, not an hour ago, 90 minutes ago, that the sport had come so far and then we see this," Smith said to _SportsCenter_ host Scott Van Pelt. "And I will tell you that I spoke to a senior NASCAR official just a few moments ago and they reiterated that statement. They're going to find who this person is, they're going to eliminate this person from the sport forever." Smith went on to say NASCAR in a place where "this despicable crap, is not only not acceptable, but there's just no place for it. And whoever that is, I hope that you are so ashamed of yourself."


  Sunday's race, which was postponed, was the first race since March where fans could attend. Only 5,000 fans were allowed to see the race, and despite NASCAR banning Confederate flags, there was one flying over the race track. Wallace, the only full-time Black driver in the NASCAR Cup Series, asking for the flag to be removed at future races.


  "He stood up for something he believed and he asked for help from other people who believe similarly," Smith continued. "The measures we're taking to start taking those steps -- and then we come down here to a place that I love." Smith went on to say he loves Talladega as it's his favorite race, which makes him angrier a noose was found in a driver's garage.


  "I am so sorry that we even have to have this discussion tonight," Smith stated. "I was really thrilled that all of the fans who made their way into the race track today, did so without any confederate flag memorabilia, or clothing, or anything stashed. Anything like that. They came to see the sport we all love so much. And then someone who had access to the garage area does this s--. I am so -- I'm just so frustrated by it." The postponed race will begin at 3 p.m. Monday on Fox.

Powerful. Poignant. United. That summed up the Premier League protests against racism as players from every single team wore 'Black Lives Matter' on the back of their shirts instead of player names for the first batch of games, plus will proudly wear the logo on their sleeve for the rest of the season. The moving moment at the start of each game when all 22 players, plus the officials, coaching staff and others at the stadiums all took a knee when the first whistle blew hit home just how strongly everyone connected with the Premier League feels about the Black Lives Matter movement. Goal celebrations from Olivier Giroud, Nathan Redmond and Allan Saint-Maximin were particularly poignant as they took a knee and raised one fist to the sky. The Premier League and its players sent out a clear message to everyone watching around the world: Black Lives Matter.

She did, however, revolutionize the boyfriend as an accessory — a way to move seamlessly between worlds — using different archetypal men for dual purposes: to have fun and to remain in the zeitgeist. And the relationships were mutually beneficial. It’s hard to overstate how easily just dating Paris Hilton in the early aughts could create cultural cache out of thin air. To date Hilton meant daily coverage — your sweaty red mug in an Ed Hardy T-shirt — in the _New York Post_ or on Perez Hilton.

 A significantly fractured Supreme Court on Thursday shot down the Trump administration's efforts to undo the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, concluding that the government's order canceling DACA was \"arbitrary and capricious.\" But the president's efforts also were cold, heartless and counter to the nation's best interests, so it's encouraging that the court allowed the program to continue.
 But DACA survived on a technicality. Had the administration taken the time to lay a proper foundation for its impulsive action to withdraw the protections for the Dreamers, this decision could have gone the other way. So as heartening as the court's decision might be, it does not resolve the underlying issue.
 DACA is, at best, a temporary solution to a broader problem, and it's one of the more frustrating aspects of our long-running political impasse over immigration reform. Reasonable minds recognize that the Dreamers stand in a unique position not of their own creation, and justice and fairness dictate that they receive some accommodation. Yet DACA, which is a policy decision that is demonstrably susceptible to political vagaries, doesn't do that. It just delays the crafting of a real solution.
 The Obama administration crafted DACA in 2012 after a bipartisan proposal in Congress was scuttled by the deep partisan divisions on immigration policy. It provides temporary protections against deportation for people who meet specific criteria based on their arrival and length of residence in the United States, who have led productive lives through jobs or schooling, and who have not had significant run-ins with the law. Most of the Dreamers bear little responsibility for their presence here since they were brought as minor children by parents or guardians.
 It would be manifestly unfair, as the anti-DACA folks demand, to uproot them from the only country most of them have ever really known and send them off to places that are not only foreign to them, but where in many instances they don't speak the language. The hardship such deportations would create on people who are Americans in all but legal standing far outweighs any purported gain in hard-line enforcement of immigration laws.
 There are other pragmatic reasons for finding a better solution to this problem. Those who qualify for DACA include parents of about 250,000 children born here in the U.S. What purpose is served in disrupting those families or, even worse, forcing parents to leave the country with children who are U.S. citizens? What sense does it make to force American children to pay a penalty for the long-ago misdeeds of their grandparents?
 Further, the DACA-eligible folks have been educated here by U.S. taxpayers, contribute to the economy, and play significant roles in their communities. The Center for American Progress estimates that more than 200,000 DACA recipients are essential workers during the coronavirus pandemic. The nation should reward them by kicking them out?
 The solution here is clear. An overwhelming majority of Americans, including Republicans, believe the government should leave the Dreamers alone and craft a path to citizenship. That can be done only by Congress. President Donald Trump has been an unreliable figure on this issue, saying at one point that he would support legislation to help the Dreamers, but then holding the issue hostage to his own dreams for a border wall with Mexico. Whether Trump would do the right thing now as he campaigns for reelection is anyone's guess, but Congress should make the effort and force the issue.
 At a base level, it's troubling and dysfunctional that a relative handful of xenophobes among Trump's base can in effect block a sensible humanitarian act supported by the vast majority of their fellow citizens. That is the antithesis of a healthy democracy. And in this instance, it has a drastic impact on the lives of people caught up in circumstances created by others. Congress needs to get its act together and take an obvious step in the national interest.

Former England captain Chris Robshaw wants to help inspire a new generation of American rugby players when he joins San Diego Legion in Major League Rugby.
 The 34-year-old Harlequins backrow forward is set to bring the curtain down on his 16 years at the English Premiership club when the season finally ends after being disrupted by the coronavirus pandemic.
 Robshaw signed a two-year contract with San Diego and wants to help nurture young players alongside New Zealand World Cup-winning New Zealand centre Ma'a Nonu.
 "It is not the level of the Premiership but I have spoken to a couple of the guys and they say it equates to the Championship (second tier) and it is growing," Robshaw told an online press conference on Monday.
 "Ma'a Nonu and myself bring experience, which can hopefully help bring through the next generation of US players and aid further development.
 "This is a sport where we pick it up at a young age like five or six years old, whereas over there a lot of guys picked it up a little bit later and for some it is their second sport."
 "I hope to introduce them to some of the finer skills and dark arts," he added with a chuckle.
 Robshaw, who captained England 43 times in his 66 Tests, said he had been considering a move abroad for a while as he and his wife (singer Camilla Kerslake) had wanted to experience a different country.
 His new life in Major League Rugby will begin with pre-season training in January.
 \- Surf board -
 Robshaw said the United States seemed like the perfect fit.
 "English-speaking helped as I was very dyslexic as a kid," he said. "I would struggle in a foreign language.
 "The choice of the move, there is an element of properly enjoying it and immersing in it.
 "The fellows sometimes have not quite enjoyed their times abroad potentially as much as they thought they might have.
 "We see it here at Harlequins. We have two good Argentinians who speak very good English as they were taught it from an early age at school. Even so, they want to speak to each other in Spanish."
 Robshaw denied the move was motivated by money.
 "I want to go somewhere new and San Diego, there is a bit of a raw and exciting element, an unknown quantity and completely different lifestyle," he said.
 "Leaving one of the best cities in the world, well, South California is not a bad place to go.
 "I have been told by the lads in San Diego 'get the surf board ready'."
 Robshaw said he would take with him some great memories both from Harlequins and England, including winning the Premiership in 2012.
 "Internationally speaking, running out at Twickenham in front of 80,000 people and singing the national anthem," he said.
 "Captaining England -- there is nothing better... leading the guys out made me so proud, more than I could ever have imagined."
 This year's Major League Rugby season was cancelled in March following the coronavirus outbreak.

Patna (Bihar) [India], June 22 (ANI): Soon after Water Resources Minister in the Bihar government, Sanjay Kumar Jha on Monday asserted to approach Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) after Nepal obstructed Bihar government from flood- prevention-related work, RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav said that the state government did not take timely action to prevent likely flood situation and it is "trying to put the onus on Centre".   "Bihar government is trying to put the onus on Centre. They are writing to MEA after Monsoon has arrived. The entire northern part of the state is in danger of getting flooded," said RJD's Tejashwi Yadav on Bihar Minister to approach MEA after Nepal obstructed Bihar government from flood prevention-related work.   "What was this double engine government doing from past so many days? I guarantee the upcoming situation will be dreadful, such a situation has been created that chances are there, Bihar and North-Bihar will be flooded. Why is their government called a double engine government? They are writing letters to each-other; PM never comes here after floods," said Yadav.   He continued saying that no relief fund is provided if flood situation arises here.   "What has Nitish Kumar-led government done in the last 15 years? They are waking up right now. This is a failure of his government. This matter could have been resolved but they did not do anything. Planning has to be done on a prior basis," said Yadav.   "Nepal and Bihar share a very old relationship. What must have happened that Nepal is behaving in such a manner all of a sudden? What initiative did Bihar government take about the development work?" he questioned.   In an apparent provocative move, Nepal has stopped all repair work of river embankments in Bihar on the India-Nepal border, by erecting barriers and effectively putting a stop to work done by India to prevent flooding of its low-lying areas, the Bihar government has alleged.   This comes at a time when tensions between Kathmandu and New Delhi have escalated over a new map in which the neighbouring country has staked claim over some Indian territories. Bihar, which shares over 700 kilometre-long international border with Nepal, can be severely affected by floods due to Nepal's action during the forthcoming rainy season as water from rivers coming from Nepal can overflow and wipe out entire villages.   Water Resources Minister in the Bihar government, Jha on Monday said his government will approach the MEA and apprise them of the threat posed by the situation.   "The Gandak barrage in Valmiki Nagar has 36 gates and 18 of those are on Nepal side. They have installed barriers there, which has never happened before. Yesterday also over 1.5 lakh cusecs water was released from the barrage. If the flood-fighting materials and our officers cannot go there, then, in that case, there will be a grave danger," Jha told ANI here.   Similarly, Nepal has obstructed repair work on the embankment on Lalbakeya river, in East Champaran district in Bihar, where there is no man's land and the dam is present for 20 years.   Bihar had constructed the embankment over the river and had been carrying out fortification work every year ahead of the monsoon. According to the Minister they have never faced such objections from Nepal.   "Repair work used to take place without any problem till last year. This time they are not letting it happen. In Madhubani's Jaynagar upstream on Kamala river too they are not letting us conduct repairs," the JDU leader added.   The Minister said that it is for the first time that such behaviour is being observed from Nepal authorities.   "This is the first time we are noticing this trend. The Bihar government is the one which does all the repair work on that side and it is the first time that we are facing difficulties in sending material and officers," he said.   The Minister also said that the local engineers and District Magistrates (DMs) are holding talks with the administration on the other side to resolve the issue. He also added that he will take up the matter with higher authorities.   "I will write a letter immediately to the MEA to make them aware of this issue. If this is not resolved soon then a major part of Bihar will get flooded during the rainy season," Jha said. (ANI)
