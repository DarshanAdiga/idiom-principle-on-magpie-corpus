Emily Daugherty remembers the days, not all that long ago, when Ligonier Valley played for district championships in girls’ basketball.
 Ligonier Valley’s first-year head coach believes the Lady Rams can get back there again. But she also knows there’s a lot of work to do in the meantime.
 For starters, the 28-year-old Daugherty, a 2010 graduate of Ligonier Valley, says that — somehow, someway — there needs to be a youth program like there was when she was a player.
 “When I was here, we started playing in second and third grade,” Daugherty indicated. “There were feeder programs all the way to high school.
 “There were so many people invested in it. That’s not there anymore.
 “There hasn’t been an interest in it for awhile now. That needs to be started back up again.”
 As it stands now, the program is only from junior high — seventh and eighth grade — on up.
 “Even now, the junior high has a hard time getting kids interested in playing. We have to change that,” Daugherty stressed.
 And even though Daugherty’s in her initial season at Ligonier Valley, this isn’t her first coaching job, so she feels she knows what it’s going to take. After graduating from Lock Haven University, Daugherty eventually became the head coach at Connellsville Area for one season following a year as an assistant. She was then an assistant at Mount Aloysius College in Cresson for one season.
 But it was Mark Burkardt, the head coach at Greater Latrobe, who actually got Daugherty interested in coaching. She served as the junior varsity coach under Burkardt in 2015-16.
 “It was he who kind of gave me the desire to be a coach,” Daugherty said of Burkardt. “He taught me how to understand girls and change my playing aspect into a coaching aspect, and it kind of went from there.”
 There’s another reason Daugherty wanted to take over the program from Tim Gustin, who resigned after five seasons — and three District 6 quarterfinal playoff appearances (2016-18) — to become Ligonier Valley’s boys coach. She sees it as a way to give back.
 “This was my high school and it kind of made me the player and person that I am,” Daugherty said. “I owe this program a lot.
 “I want to try and rebuild the system that I grew up in from the bottom up. To kind of come full circle is pretty cool.”
 With only two seniors who averaged less than two points between them last season, the Lady Rams won just three games (3-18) and went 2-12 in the District 6 Heritage Conference. They also averaged only 30.2 points a game, shooting 21% from the floor.
 “Last season’s team was young. It was a learning process,” Daugherty explained.
 “There’s room for growth, but the girls are eager to learn. They’re still young for the most part, but they want to learn.
 “I think it’s exciting to them. We have some kids who stopped playing basketball, but have taken it back up again.”
 Now all Ligonier Valley has to do is get on the court.
 The Lady Rams haven’t held any practices yet this season. That’s primarily because the school district has conducted remote-only learning for the last several weeks, putting athletics on hold.
 On top of that, Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf enacted a temporary shutdown of high school and youth athletics last week because of the pandemic. The three- week, limited-time mitigation efforts remain in effect until 8 a.m., Jan. 4. Wolf said his decision was made to curb the current spread of coronavirus (COVID-19), in addition to keeping hospitals and health care workers from becoming overwhelmed throughout the holiday season, among other measures.
 Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic Association (PIAA) guidelines require teams to complete 15 practices before their first games, matches or meets. That means when — and if — sports are allowed to resume, Ligonier Valley won’t be able to play until the end of January, at the earliest.
 When the Lady Rams finally do, they’ll also be back in the WPIAL after more than 50 years in District 6. Ligonier Valley will be playing “up,” as well — electing to do so because of travel — in Class 4A that includes Mount Pleasant Area, Southmoreland, Yough, Belle Vernon Area, Elizabeth Forward and West Mifflin Area.
 So far, all Daugherty has been able to do is converse with the players by email and watch video from last season. She did take in two open gyms, but that was two months ago.
 “We’re just trying to keep them involved and their hopes up,” Daugherty stated. “They want to play.
 “One week, we could be told that we can play, and the next week, we could be shut down. It’s hard to say what’s going to happen at this point.
 “We do have some young kids who show great potential, and we have some older kids who show that they can be great leaders.”
 Like last season, the Lady Rams have only two seniors. They are guards Carol Woods, who averaged 4.1 points and 3.6 rebounds, and is expected to be a starter, along with Bella Vargulish.
 “Woods is a pretty good shooter and has already showed great leadership and has been eager in welcoming me,” Daugherty indicated. “She’s kind of helped me get a grasp of the younger kids.”
 As of now, Daugherty can only name four players who will likely be starters. The others are sophomore guard Haley Boyd, the team’s leading scorer last season at 11.6 points a game while also averaging 4.4 rebounds, 2.3 assists and 2.2 steals, and a pair of junior forwards in Abby Painter (2.3 rebounds) and Haley Stormer.
 “Boyd is a very good player and knows her teammates the best,” Daugherty noted. “We’re probably going to put a lot of pressure on her, but I think she can handle it and help lead this team.
 “Painter is pretty tough underneath the basket. She’s probably going to get a lot of minutes.
 “Stormer is very aggressive, can rebound well and isn’t afraid of contact. It kind of looks like she never quit playing for a couple of years.”
 However, Ligonier Valley’s second-leading scorer (7.3 points) and top rebounder (6.6) from last season as a sophomore — guard Kaelyn Adams — decided not to come out. The other returnees are 5-foot-9 junior forward Maddie Griffin (3.3 points, 4.1 rebounds), 6-foot sophomore forward Lizzy Crissman (5.8 rebounds) and sophomore guard Mara Myers.
 Three freshmen — guards Amanda Wood and Clara Woods, and forward Abrielle Tutino — are also on the roster. Other players on the team could include junior guard Sarah Sheeder, freshmen guards Madison Marinchak and Lyla Barr, in addition to freshmen forwards Jadyn Cunningham and Alexa Harding.
 “I know the next couple years are going to be a learning process,” Daugherty concluded. “The girls need to grow their skills and knowledge of the game.”

An increase in "bigotry" during Donald Trump's presidency fueled homophobia, but it also spurred a new wave of LGBT+ activism in the United States, according to the director of a documentary about the renowned San Francisco Gay Men's Chorus."Gay Chorus Deep South", to be broadcast on Pop, Logo and Pluto TV on Sunday, follows the choir as it toured the U.S. South during Trump's first year in office to attempt to bridge divisions exposed by the 2016 presidential election."What these four years have done, in terms of legislation, in terms of bigotry, has heightened (things). But I think that it also strengthened the other side," said documentary director David Charles Rodrigues."A lot of people woke up and understood that they needed to be active, and they needed to get out and be vocal about things and be more proactive politically," he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in a video call.The San Francisco Gay Men's Chorus was founded in 1978 at a time when the inclusion of the word "gay" in the title was still controversial."The chorus is iconic because in 1978, while there was a surge of pride, we were still in a time period when you could be fired anywhere for being gay," said Tim Seelig, the chorus's artistic director and conductor."(When) the San Francisco Gay Men's chorus met for the first time, they argued about what they're going to call themselves, because some were like, 'We can't have 'gay' in the name'."A new name for the group now might also be pending, he added. "There's a movement now that we shouldn't call ourselves the San Francisco Gay Men's chorus, because it's exclusionary, and that's a road which this chorus will go down."'Positive and heartwarming'That first meeting of about 100 people at San Francisco's Everett Middle School sparked a global movement of LGBT+ choruses, Seelig said.But the chorus's early roots as simply a place for gay men to come together and sing quickly took a darker turn with the advent of HIV/AIDS in the early 1980s.A famous photograph from 1993 of the 125-strong chorus shows the vast majority dressed in black with just seven dressed in white, representing the 118 members who had died at that point.To date, nearly 300 singers have died, most due to complications from AIDS."Singing for Our Lives" by U.S. singer-songwriter Holly Near has since become a torch song for the chorus."In our youth, (AIDS) became all absorbing," Seelig said."(But) it set a tone that we weren't just the party girls. That we were, indeed, the people that were going to nurture," he added. "And it deepened the entire movement, but especially the gay choral movement."The documentary, which has won numerous awards including Best Documentary at the Milan International Lesbian and Gay Film Festival, follows the chorus on its "Lavender Pen Tour" through five southern states in late 2017.Yet despite expectations of negative reactions in what remain socially conservative and religious parts of America, the reaction to the tour was overwhelmingly positive - almost at one point at the expense of the documentary, said its director."We were not only surprised, but I was honestly and selfishly disappointed," Rodrigues said, laughing."But then there was a point when I realised that the radical thing, in this day and age, is to be positive, and we just decided to be truthful to the experience that we had, which was 90% was positive and heartwarming."(This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.)Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter

 # Christmas Dreams

 The best gifts don’t wait for Christmas. They show up when we need them.
 On September 1, 2001, I published my first book and planned to leave soon on a multi-city book tour. Plans changed ten days later when thousands of Americans lost their lives in a terrorist attack.
 But a few weeks later, I boarded a nearly empty flight to begin signing books around the country. It was a strange time to do a book tour. But I knew somehow it was right time.
 Fast forward to October 15, 2020, when in a worldwide pandemic, I published my second book, a novel. This time I knew there’d be no book tour. No hugs or handshakes or tears shared with readers. But again, I knew it was the right time. I’d spent years writing it. I was ready, at last, to let it go.
 I’ve loved reading emails and book reviews from readers, and realizing how happy they are for me, finishing my longtime dream. But I’ve missed having a personal connection, getting to see the look in readers’ eyes and the smiles on their faces.
 Imagine my surprise last week to be invited to speak at a book club that was reading my book. They had met in each other’s homes for more than 25 years, until the pandemic. Now they meet online with Zoom.
 It was the easiest book talk I’ve ever done. For Zoom, you only need to get dressed from the waist up. I wore sweat pants and UGG boots, which I’d never do for a “real” meeting, lest my mother would spin in her grave.
 The best part was getting to look (virtually) into everyone’s eyes, to hear in their voices and sense in their smiles the miracle that can happen when someone reads the words you’ve written and understands your heart.
 Three days later, I joined a second Zoom meeting for a reunion of Youth Tour 2000, a once-in-a-lifetime experience I took part in 20 years ago.
 On the first Sunday in 2000, I sat in Bethel Unspeakable Joy Fellowship in South Central Los Angeles, and heard Pastor Carol Houston talk about her dream to take children from her church on a cross-country bus tour.
 I thought to myself, “That woman is crazy.” But dreamers need to be a bit crazy to dream of things like taking kids on a bus tour or writing a book.
 Having done my share of chaperoning bus trips, I did not want to get on that bus. But when Pastor Carol invited me to join them, I knew it was the right thing to do. So I said “yes” to an experience that changed not only my life, but the lives of most of us on that bus.
 That change was clear 10 years ago when we met for a reunion and shared memories of the trip and what it meant to us. And it was still clear last week when we met again, this time online.
 At the end of the meeting, Pastor Carol urged everyone to hold on tight to our God-given dreams and to trust God to make them a reality.
 I like Pastor Carol a lot. It was a gift to see her and her now grown flock again, and to realize her dream is still changing lives.
 My third early Christmas gift came today, not on Zoom, but in the flesh. I’d been moping about, missing my family and friends and the pandemic-free life I once took for granted.
 I thought the doorbell was a delivery. But it was my daughter and her 9-year- old Henry. They kept socially distant, didn’t come in the house, just want to surprise me with two early gifts: a potted narcissus (my daughter knows I love them) and a picture Henry drew (he knows I love his drawings) of Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.
 I wish you could see them.
 The best gifts of all are dreams that come true. They can show up in any form, a smile or a kindness or an unexpected visit. But they are always what we need, just when we need it.
 What’s your Christmas dream?

Joe Biden said Thursday that he believed efforts to use his son as a political cudgel amounted to "foul play" amid a federal investigation into Hunter Biden's tax matters and Republican calls for a special counsel investigation into his foreign dealings."We have great confidence in our son," Biden said in an interview with CBS late-night host Stephen Colbert. "I'm not concerned about any accusations that have been made against him, it's used to get me. I think it's kind of foul play but -- look, it is what it is."CBS News originally reported that Biden had called the federal investigation itself "foul play." But the Biden campaign denied that characterization and released a fuller transcript of the exchange, saying the president-elect was describing broader efforts to politically exploit his son's business dealings."There has indisputably been 'foul play' of that exact kind," Biden spokesman Andrew Bates tweeted, referring to people who use Hunter Biden as a "cudgel" against his father. "Trump got himself impeached engaging in it."The comments were some of Biden's most extensive since the disclosure earlier this month of the investigation into his son's tax dealings.The probes include one led by the Delaware US Attorney's office into whether Hunter Biden violated tax laws, and another by the US Attorney for the Western District of Pennsylvania concerns his activities in Ukraine and potential money laundering, according to a person familiar with the matter who discussed the sensitive inquiry on condition of anonymity. At least one of the probes has been ongoing since 2018, a third person said.But the effort has been clouded by President Donald Trump's precedent-shattering public demands for an inquiry into Biden's son. As recently as Sunday, Trump complained that Attorney General William Barr did not disclose the federal tax inquiry before Election Day.Trump, in a tweet earlier Thursday, denied playing any role in decisions regarding the investigation.Barr announced Monday that he plans to resign before Christmas. He made the announcement shortly after Trump criticized him in an interview with Fox News and White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany told the network the president was "frustrated" Barr hadn't done more to highlight the Hunter Biden case to voters.Republican lawmakers -- including Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham of South Carolina -- have also seized on the probe, calling for the appointment of a special counsel.Colbert asked Biden about his relationship with Graham, a longtime friend, in light of Graham's support for Trump's efforts to overturn the election results. "Lindsey's been a personal disappointment because I was a personal friend of his," Biden said.Biden also said he would reach out to Republicans -- even those who attack him -- "if it benefits the country."The investigation into Biden's Ukraine work began based on information provided by Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, spurring tensions between Justice Department officials over how credible the allegations were.Hunter Biden confirmed that the investigation into his taxes is continuing. It's wasn't clear if the Ukraine-related investigation is still ongoing.U.S. officials also have conducted a counterintelligence assessment related to Hunter Biden's activities, the person said.The Bidens have repeatedly insisted no wrongdoing was committed, and the president-elect on Thursday again voiced support for his son."As long as he's good, we're good," Joe Biden said.

Michael Schoenfeld, the chief communications officer at Duke, said, "Duke will respond accordingly through our disciplinary process."
 UNC-Chapel Hill Chancellor Kevin M. Guskiewicz said the school was "extremely disappointed to learn of these alleged actions on our campus."
 A statement from Appalachian State said officials are "committed to providing a safe campus, and will continue our work with education and prevention, as well as utilizing student conduct and law enforcement processes, to do so."
 Eight of the accused have pleaded guilty to at least one charge, prosecutors say. One, Francisco Javier Ochoa, 27, of Turlock, California, pleaded guilty to drug conspiracy charges last month and was sentenced to 73 months in prison.
 The national offices of the three fraternities at UNC issued statements to CNN after the charges were announced Thursday.
 "It is shocking to learn of the allegations involving our chapter and others at the University of North Carolina," read the Phi Gamma Delta statement. "These allegations are very serious, suggest conduct which violate our policies and values, and we have zero tolerance for the alleged actions. We are committed to working with law enforcement and the University to fully understand the involvement of our members."
 Beta Theta Pi said the charges involve one of its members who graduated last year.
 "The Fraternity does not tolerate the possession, sale, distribution or use of illegal substances and holds its chapters to high standards in maintaining a safe environment for all students," Beta Theta Pi said. "We are working in tandem with our undergraduates, volunteers and UNC administrators to determine next steps and will take appropriate action as new information becomes available."
 Kappa Sigma's national organization said its leadership is "greatly concerned" about the allegations and will investigate them internally.
 The fraternity's local chapter said two undergraduate senior members were among those arrested.
 "The actions of these two individuals is not representative of the organization as a whole and are a violation of the code of conduct and chapter bylaws," Kappa Sigma's Alpha Mu chapter said in a statement. "The members were immediately suspended officially on November 3rd pending expulsion. As an organization and as leadership we are doing everything in our power to assist with the investigation and are willing to fully cooperate with authorities."

They stole it fair and square. We're outgunned. We're not going to fight.' I don't believe in surrendering. I believe in fighting for our country.

Kazakhstan is trying yet again to force its citizens to install a "national security certificate" on every internet-capable device in the country. That government-issued root certificate would allow authorities to keep tabs on people's online traffic, essentially becoming a back door to access citizens' data. As a response to the country's latest attempt to spy on people's devices, Apple, Google, Microsoft and Mozilla have teamed up like they did last year to block the certificate from working on their browsers.In its announcement, Mozilla said it was recently informed that ISPs in Kazakhstan have recently started telling customers that they're required to install the digital certificate to be able to access foreign websites. ZDNet reported earlier this month that Kazakh IPS have been cutting people's access to websites like Google, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and Netflix unless they install the certificate. As the publication notes, this is far from the first time the country's government tried to keep a close eye on its citizens' online activities. It made a similar attempt back in 2015 and then again in 2019, but tech giants helped to put a stop to those plans by blocking the certificate like what they're doing now. When users in Kazakhstan who complied with their ISPs' demand try to access websites on their devices, they'll get an error telling them that the certificate shouldn't be trusted. The companies are also encouraging those users to research the use if VPN or the Tor Browser for web browsing and to change the passwords for their accounts.

And so on January 6 at 1 p.m., we're going to have a roll call of the states. That roll call of the states will be presided over by Vice President Mike Pence. It will be a joint session of Congress, at which point in time each state submits their purported Electoral College votes. We in Congress have the absolute right to object to and reject those state submittals of Electoral College votes. We believe that they're not worthy of our trust. The requirement first is that you have a House member and Senator who jointly file that objection. I'm willing to do the House side, and I should add there are lots of other congressmen who want to do it on the House side, too -- more congressmen that want to object than we have states to object to.

The investigation conducted by a US Drug Enforcement Administration task force and the Orange County Sheriff's Office "revealed drug activity involving members of several fraternal organizations at universities in the state," the news release said.
 Court filings specifically allege illegal drug activity involving the UNC chapters of Phi Gamma Delta, Kappa Sigma and Beta Theta Pi between 2017 and the spring of this year, according to the US Attorney's Office.
 One of the 21 defendants was a student at Duke University who allegedly distributed cocaine to fellow students and to fraternity members from UNC- Chapel Hill, the US Attorney's Office said.
 Two students at Appalachian State University in Boone were also accused of distributing drugs to fellow students, specifically LSD and cocaine, the news release said.
 Martin said that over several years the suspects allegedly moved more than a thousand of pounds of marijuana and hundreds of kilograms of cocaine and other drugs through their supply chain. The drug proceeds exceeded $1.5 million, according to the DEA.
 "This is about saving lives," Martin told reporters Thursday. "This really is a public health crisis. We really have to stand together, cut off the supply."
 DEA Special Agent in Charge Robert Murphy said in the news release, "These fraternity members' drug trafficking crimes contributed to a toxic and dangerous environment on these college campuses. The arrest of these drug traffickers makes these college campuses and their respective communities safer."
 In statements to CNN, all three universities said they are cooperating with law enforcement.

“Well, there’s college coaches across the country making millions of dollars and that’s not controversial, making off the backs of college athletes that are unpaid,” Bohannon said in a phone interview. “We have a game on Christmas Day and our families can’t even go to the game and we have to play, theoretically making money for these TV contracts that (conferences) signed. It blows my mind.”

And yet, “LGBTQ+ representation” still often stands in for “white and middle- class lesbian and gay representation”, even under a new banner of inclusivity. Happiest Season is a landmark film for LGBTQ+ representation, yes, but it leaves other norms untouched. Sexuality intersects with gender, race and class – on and off screen. The whiteness and wealth of the protagonists might not be commented on within the film itself, but that doesn’t mean they don’t matter.
