Trump has taken credit for his restrictions on travel to the U.S. from China and hard-hit European countries, arguing it contributed to slowing the spread of the virus in the U.S. But he has yet to extend those restrictions to other nations now experiencing virus outbreaks.
 Due to the pandemic, almost all visa processing by the State Department, including immigrant visas, has been suspended for weeks.
 Meanwhile on Monday, a chorus of governors from both parties pushed back hard Monday after Trump accused Democrats of playing “a very dangerous political game” by insisting there is a shortage of tests for coronavirus. The governors countered that the White House must do more to help states do the testing that’s needed before they can ease up on stay-at-home orders.
 Kansas’ Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly said the current federal effort “really is not good enough if we’re going to be able to start to open our economy. We cannot do that safely without the tests in place.”
 Supply shortages have stymied U.S. testing for weeks. The needs range from basic supplies like swabs and protective gear to highly specialized laboratory chemicals needed to analyze patient results. Hospitals, laboratories and state health departments report scouring the globe to secure orders, competing against each other and their peers abroad.
 The governors’ plea for stepped-up coordination came on the latest day when the Trump administration provided discordant messaging: Trump blasted state leaders on Twitter for being too dependent on federal government and said later that some governors just didn’t understand what they had, while Vice President Mike Pence assured governors the government was working around the clock to help them ramp up testing.
 Pence sought to soften the administration’s message amid growing clamor from both parties for a national testing strategy to help secure testing swabs, chemical reagents and other crucial supplies.
 “When it comes to testing, we’re here to help,” Pence told governors during a video conference from the headquarters of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The Associated Press obtained audio of the call.
 Pence said the administration sent each state a detailed list Monday of testing capacity. But Maryland’s Republican Gov. Larry Hogan said much of the unused lab machinery listed for his state was in federal labs the state does not have access to. Pence said the administration has agreed to open up federal labs to help states.
 Hogan announced Monday that the state had received 500,000 tests from South Korea — a “game-changing” deal negotiated by his wife, Yumi Hogan, who grew up outside Seoul.

TUPELO - The COVID-19 Support Fund, a joint effort between the CREATE Foundation and the United Way of Northeast Mississippi, distributed more than $60,000 in funds to partner organizations for the week of April 12-18, according to a press release.
 The total contributions received is $268,500. With more than $220,000 distributed overall, CREATE President Mike Clayborne said they have very limited funds available now.
 “(COVID-19) is going to be an ongoing thing for some time, and so we really need people to consider making contributions to this fund (and) allow this work to continue,” Clayborne said.
 United Way works with community agencies to identify needs. The primary focus at this time is on food, formula and diapers, medication and supporting frontline personnel. The fund has also begun some assistance with utilities.
 “We have people in place that are in touch with the agencies, so people that are looking to make contributions to get money where it's most needed, I think we can say with some assurance that we’re making sure that happens with the disbursements,” Clayborne said.
 The Salvation Army, which works with the Family Resource Center of North Mississippi to help individuals requesting assistance due to COVID-19, remains the largest recipient of the funds, receiving $20,000 for food and utilities. The organization previously received $55,000 for food, formula, diapers, medication and utilities.
 Lift, Inc. received $5,000 for food and utilities.
 Contributions largely focused on addressing food security. In order to do so, the support fund works with the Tupelo-Lee County Hunger Coalition to evaluate food needs and to identify organizations for support, the release said.
 Last week, St. Luke Food Pantry received $10,000; Aberdeen Loaves & Fishes, Amory Food Pantry, Fulton Food Pantry and Mission Okolona each received $5,000; and the Helpful Samaritan Tishomingo County, Itawamba Food Pantry West, and Union County Good Samaritan each received $2,500.
 Previous disbursements include $25,000 to the Family Resource Center for food, formula, diapers, medications and utilities; $10,000 each to the Meals on Wheels of Lee County and Meals on Wheels of Monroe County for meals delivered to senior citizens; $10,000 to Saints’ Brew for food; $15,000 to Eight Days of Hope to support Feed Tupelo; $5,000 to the Tippah County Good Samaritan; and $10,000 for Alcorn County food needs.
 The fund has also committed itself to working to help frontline workers. Feeding the Frontline provides meals for North Mississippi Medical Center frontline personnel. The effort received a $10,000 disbursement. Donors are also able to make designated donations explicitly for that purpose.
 Additional disbursements are considered and made several times a week as contributions are received and designations are made for the benefit of a specific county or purpose, the release said.
 Some contributions may be designated for a specific county or purpose, as donors are allowed to designate which county they want their contributions to benefit. While Clayborne said some distributions are driven by where they received contributions, they also make distributions to a broader area.
 Individuals requesting assistance must apply directly with the Family Resource Center at frcnms.org. The staff at Salvation Army send gift cards to families that have been approved.
 Individuals and companies interested in donating to the COVID-19 Support Fund can do so at www.unitedwaynems.org/covid19fund, by calling 662-841-9133 to make a donation over the phone or mailing a check to either United Way at P.O. Box 334, Tupelo, MS 38802 or CREATE Foundation at P.O. Box 1053, Tupelo, MS 38802.

Visions -- one of the organizations consulting with Arlington on its diversity, equity and inclusion efforts -- recently hired Elika Dadsetan-Foley as its executive director.
 Visions consultants Rick Pinderhughes, Michelle Holmes and Doug Weinstock have been working with Arlington over the past several months, along with others, to improve the town's diversity, equity and inclusion efforts.
 After 36 years in the captain's chair, Valerie Batts stepped down as Visions' executive director, announcing Dadsetan-Foley her successor. Batts will remain part of the organization and will focus her time in keeping her hands and mind in the work, while Dadsetan-Foley will focus on the actual running of Visions as an organization.​
 "I'm thrilled to join Visions, both in the U.S. and across the world, through our widespread consultant team, including our work in Arlington," Dadsetan- Foley said.
 Dadsetan-Foley has worked on five continents doing social justice, development and humanitarian work, including with the World Bank.
 She's been an activist from an early age, concerned and fighting for the environment, homelessness and refugees since childhood, and she's excited to bring that energy to Boston.
 "I feel very humbled to join the Visions community," she said, adding that she is very excited to come on board and support Visions in continuing to do the work they do, across the country and the world.
 She chose to settle into work in the U.S. after nearly a decade abroad, after she rescued her German shepherd mix, Server, from Lebanon -- a choice that brought her back to be closer to her family, and which eventually led her to meeting her now-partner, Sean Dadsetan-Foley, in Baltimore.
 She has made the "first real home" of her adult life in Duxbury -- after time in France, Lebanon, Tajikistan, Sierra Leone and Iraq -- and looks forward to continuing the work Visions started over 35 years ago.
 "I am delighted to welcome Elika to Visions. [The] Visions board decided in early 2019 that our work was clearly needed in the world more than ever and that it was time to find a new leader who could guide us into the future. Our vision is to be a catalyst for a more equitable world where differences are valued and utilized for the benefit of all. Elika's passion and life's work are so synchronous with this view; the breadth and depth of her experience in living into this vision will enhance all of our ability to help achieve this goal," said Batts.

Weeks of confinement imposed by the coronavirus pandemic is taking a chilling toll on women and girls across Latin America, where the number of calls to helplines have soared, made by victims of domestic violence who cannot flee.
 Appeals to help women experiencing violence in the home have redoubled in recent weeks, from the United Nations to Pope Francis -- Latin America's first pontiff.
 "The confinement is plunging thousands of women into hell, trapped with an attacker who they are more afraid of than the coronavirus," said Victoria Aguirre from the Argentine NGO MuMaLa, which campaigns against violence related to macho culture.
 In Argentina, 18 women have been killed by their partner or ex-partners during the first 20 days of a mandatory quarantine instituted by the government from March 20. Appeals to helplines in Argentina are up nearly 40 percent.
 The country is still reeling from the shocking murder of Cristina Iglesias and her seven-year-old daughter Ada, killed by her mother's partner in the early days of the lockdown.
 Their two bodies were found buried in the backyard of their home in a town in Buenos Aires province.
 Elsewhere, police -- alerted by neighbors -- arrived in the nick of time to save a woman whose husband attacked her with a hammer.
 \- Living in fear -
 A staggering 3,800 women were murdered in Latin America in 2019, an 8 percent increase on the previous year, according to preliminary data from the Observatory for Gender Equality at CEPAL, the UN's Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean.
 "Unfortunately, many women and girls are particularly exposed to violence precisely where they should be protected, in their own homes," said UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, who issued a call for a domestic violence "ceasefire" as lockdowns extended into April.
 "You live in fear of turning your back on him. It is only later, when the bruises appear, that you realize that he could have killed you," Luciana, a 25-year-old victim of domestic violence, told AFP. She was badly beaten by her ex-husband.
 "Every day, a women is abused, raped or beaten at home by her partner or her ex," said Ada Rico, from the NGO La Casa del Encuentro.
 "In normal times, we would help her to file a complaint. These days, the urgency is to get her out of the house as quickly as possible."
 The situation is similarly grim in Mexico, Brazil, Chile and elsewhere, where measures taken by the authorities often fall far short of properly protecting victims.
 In Mexico, "emergency calls have increased" since the start of the lockdown on March 24, said Nadine Gasman, head of the National Women's Institute in Mexico City.
 Maria Salguero, who researches violence against women and created a "femicide map" around the country, estimated that around 200 women have been murdered since quarantine measures began.
 \- Rape and murder -
 The sordid murder of Ana Paola, a 13-year-old who was raped and beaten to death by a burglar in the northeastern state of Sonora in early April, provoked widespread disgust and anger in Mexico.
 Emergency calls to the National Refugee Network, an NGO which caters to women victims of violence, have increased by 60 percent since the beginning of the confinement period. The number of women taken into care by the organization is up 5 percent.
 With more than 1,000 femicides in 2019, two recent brutal murders -- one of a seven-year-old girl -- once again highlighted a lack of action by authorities.
 Mexican feminist activists have demanded more effective policies from President Andres Manuel Lopez to combat the wave of violence.
 It's a similar case in Peru, where 2019 femicides were the highest in a decade.
 In Sao Paulo, the epicenter of Brazil's virus outbreak, reports of domestic violence have risen by 30 percent since the state government imposed a stay- at-home order.
 A group of 700 volunteers have formed a "vigilante network" to provide victims with medical, legal and psychological assistance through a WhatsApp messaging service.
 In Chile, which has opted for selective confinement in the most affected areas plus a nighttime curfew, complaints of domestic violence are up 500 percent in Providencia, an upper class neighborhood in the capital Santiago.
 The crisis has resulted in "increased alcohol consumption, mental health effects, increased anxiety, depression and violence within families," said senior health official Paula Daza.

 The development comes as the U.S. death toll from the virus topped 42,000 on Monday, according to a Reuters tally.
 The United States has by far the world's largest number of confirmed coronavirus cases, with more than 774,000 infections, up 20,000 on Monday.
 The U.S. economy has ground to a standstill due to the coronavirus and more than 22 million people have applied for unemployment benefits in the last month.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration and Congress are nearing an agreement on an aid package of up to $450 billion to boost a small-
 business loan program that has run out of money and add funds for hospitals and COVID-19 testing.
 President Donald Trump said Sunday, "We're getting close to a deal."
 Along with the small business boost, Trump said the negotiators were looking at "helping our hospitals," particularly hard-hit rural health care providers.
 A deal could be announced today, the president said at a White House briefing.
 With small-business owners reeling during a coronavirus outbreak that has shuttered much economic activity, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said earlier Sunday he was hopeful of a deal that could pass Congress quickly and get the Small Business Administration program back up by midweek.
 "I think we're very close to a deal today. I'm hopeful that we can get that done," he said.
 Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said he believed a deal could be reached late Sunday or early today. "We still have a few more details to deal with," he said.
 The Senate is scheduled for a pro forma session today, but no vote has been set.
 The House announced it could meet as soon as Wednesday for a recorded vote on the pending package, according to a schedule update from Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md.
 Under the emerging deal there would be $300 billion for the small-business payroll program, and $50 billion would be available for the small business disaster fund. Additionally, it would bring $75 billion for hospitals and $25 billion for testing, according to those involved in the talks
 On a conference call Sunday afternoon that included Trump, Mnuchin and Republican senators, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., indicated the only remaining item for discussion involved the money for testing, according to a Senate GOP leadership aide who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss a private call.
 Under the emerging deal, the government's Paycheck Protection Program for small businesses would get about $300 billion, according to Mnuchin. The program has been swamped by companies applying for loans and reached its appropriations limit last Thursday after approving nearly 1.7 million loans. That left thousands of small businesses in limbo as they sought help. An additional $50 billion in the evolving deal would go for disaster loans.
 About $75 billion would go to U.S. hospitals, for those straining under a ballooning coronavirus caseload as well as those struggling to stay financially afloat after suspending elective surgeries during the pandemic. About
 $25 billion would be added for COVID-19 testing, something states have said was needed urgently. The money for hospitals and testing were priorities sought by congressional Democrats.
 But additional aid to state and local governments would be left out, Mnuchin said. Democrats have been keen to boost funding to cash-strapped states and local governments whose revenues have cratered, but the issue threatened to provoke fights between large, high-tax states like California and New York and smaller states more typically run by Republicans.

_New York, 21 apr 01:34 - (Agenzia Nova)_ \- Il presidente degli Stati Uniti, Donald Trump, ha dichiarato che "non abbiamo davvero bisogno" della Defense Production Act per incrementare i test del coronavirus. Lo riporta l'emittente "Cnn". Durante il briefing della Casa Bianca i giornalisti hanno chiesto a Trump se ha intenzione di invocare le legge federale, che costringerebbe una società di forniture mediche a produrre più tamponi per rilevare i contagiati. "Non ne abbiamo davvero bisogno ... a volte tutto quello che devono fare è vederlo arrivare". Il presidente non ha fornito ulteriori indicazioni al riguardo. Due settimane fa Trump aveva affermato che il suo uso del Defence Production Act (Dpa), per garantire che determinate risorse sanitarie e mediche fossero destinate all'uso interno, era stato in parte una "rappresaglia" nei confronti di aziende che non avevano dato al governo le forniture richieste. "Se le persone non lo fanno, se le persone non ci danno ciò di cui abbiamo bisogno per la nostra gente, saremo molto duri e siamo stati molto duri". Il presidente aveva menzionato in modo specifico la 3M , precisando che la compagnia fornisca mascherine sanitarie agli Stati Uniti, invece di inviarle in altri luoghi. (Nys)

Once these wheels were (finally) set up, they performed super well, especially when considering that they’re $1,000 less than Enve’s next-cheapest offering. That said, they rode almost exactly like a $1,600 wheelset should. While they did handle better than I’d expect at this depth in crosswinds, there wasn’t much else that made them stand out from a similarly priced wheelset. I do love that Enve’s wheels continue to be handmade and assembled in the U.S.—HED also does the same thing in this price range, though their $1,500 Jet RC Plus Disc Series wheels are a bit heavier. It is exciting that triathletes can get a pair of Enve wheels on their bikes (also look for them as OEM on tri brands in the future) without having to sell a kidney, but I’d love to see some aero numbers with this wheelset against other wheels in the $1,500-2,000 range to make sure it’s worth it altogether. All in all, the Foundation 65s are a great wheelset at a decent price, compared to other brands. Keep your eyes peeled for an upcoming showdown where we’ll pair the Foundation 65s against a big mid-budget category killer to see who can take the crown.

PLYMOUTH - James Kernen spent years dreaming of playing football for Plymouth South. He first stepped onto the sideline during a game as 6-year-old, serving as the team's water boy. Season after season, he rarely missed a game, always waiting for the day when he could wear the black and teal. And when he finally did, he made the most of it.
 "He was this little skinny kid with glasses," remembers recently retired Head Football Coach Scott Fry.
 Kernen isn't little or skinny anymore. Now 6-foot-5 and 250 pounds, he was instrumental in leading the Panthers to the Division 4 Super Bowl last season, playing tackle on both sides of the ball. His play earned him a spot on the Patriot League All-Star team.
 "He dominated [opponents], but he's also a really good athlete," Fry said.
 Kernen was also selected to play in the prestigious Shriners High School All- Star Football Classic, which was scheduled to be played June 19 but was recently cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
 "It was an honor to be selected," he said. "It was a goal of mine since sophomore year. It was just really special for me and my family to be honored."
 Kernen's connection to the football program began when his childhood friend, Anthony Loranger, the son of wrestling coach Marc Loranger, asked him if he wanted to join him on the sidelines as the team water boy. "I said sure, and I did it every year, every game," he said.
 He was on the sidelines when the Panthers went to the 2013 Super Bowl, dreaming that it would be him someday. "I kept thinking when I get to that point, I want to do what they're doing, but better," he said.
 "Going into my sophomore year, I had no clue if I'd be playing," he said. "I just put my head down, worked out, tried to put on as much weight as I could and then see where the chips fell. When I started the first game, it was special to finally see all those dreams come to fruition."
 The fact that Kernen played tackle last season was testimony to his leadership qualities. When he first suited up at Plymouth South, he was a tight end. But Fry asked him to shift to the less-glamorous offense tackle position in his sophomore season. And after playing defensive end in his sophomore and junior years, Fry moved him to defensive tackle last season. Those are not the type of position changes many players would embrace, but Kernen did so without complaint.
 "He would do anything for the team," Fry said. "He had no problem doing whatever we needed him to do. He was the ultimate team player. He's probably one of the best captains I've ever had at South. He was all about winning football games, which is what made him such a good leader."
 By the time Fry asked him to switch position on defense last season, Kernen said, "I was kind of used to it at that point, so it just came naturally.
 "If it's best for the team, you just do it, no questions asked," he said.
 The highlight of Kernen's senior season came on Sept. 27 when the Panthers scored a touchdown with 16 seconds remaining to upset defending Super Bowl champion Scituate, 15-9.
 "This was a statement game for us," he said. "To come back in the last minute and score a touchdown … I've been around the program a long time and I think it was probably the loudest I'd heard that stadium in 11 years."
 The Panthers did not lose another game until the Super Bowl.
 A National Honor Roll student, Kernen will head to Assumption College in the fall to study business, with a focus on marketing. He'll also play football.
 "I think he'll be a phenomenal college player," Fry said. "He's just going to get better and better, because he has a tremendous work ethic."

No, the answer isn’t Asia (for once). First off, Enve says they’ve been working on their manufacturing methods to help cut down the price, but more tangibly, they’ve also cut a few corners to lop off over $1,000. While the internal mechanism in the rear hub is the same as Enve’s higher-end wheels, the hub shell is notably different than the unique aluminum hubs that come on Enve’s SES line. The bearings in the Foundations are also steel—as opposed to stainless steel—which could be an issue for durability later down the road. Otherwise, there’s not a lot that’s different between the two wheelsets, except that Enve claims a wattage savings with the SES line, particularly at higher yaw angles. Most likely this is due to the 5.6s using a different rim shape in the front and in the rear.

We remain an essential service and our Inspectors are continuing to respond to emergencies and animal welfare complaints."

El Estado dispuso ahora que el 50% de la asistencia salarial se deposite en las cuentas sueldo de los beneficiarios. Lo mismo que el crédito a tasa 0 para monotributistas y autónomos. La pregunta que se hacen los privados es si estará dispuesto a seguir en esa línea para afrontar los desafíos que siguen. Porque por ahora lo que está resolviendo es el problema de abril, pero mayo espera con una urgencia tal vez más dramática. Con la cadena de pagos cortada, la montaña de cheques que rebotarán en el sistema también requiere una solución. Una misión que el BCRA debe resolver si no quiere ver concursos de acreedores en cadena.

"The president is willing to consider that in the next bill, but wants to get this over the finish line with a focus on small businesses, hospitals and testing," Mnuchin said.
 He said he's been in touch with GOP leaders including McConnell and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., and all are "on board with the same plan." On the Sunday call with senators, Mnuchin and McConnell reiterated that money for state and local governments as well as food stamps would not be included in the package, according to the GOP aide.
 "I'm hopeful that we can reach an agreement, that the Senate can pass this tomorrow, and that the House can take it up on Tuesday, and, Wednesday, we'd be back up and running," Mnuchin said earlier in his TV interview.
 Schumer said Democrats would insist on aid for state and local governments. They had submitted a compromise offer Friday that would provide $150 billion for states as well as cities, counties and towns based on need. Key swing states for Trump in the November presidential election — Pennsylvania, Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin — would receive billions in new aid under the proposal, according to a senior Democratic aide who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss details of private negotiations.
 "We are pushing hard," Schumer said. "We don't want our police, our firefighters, our EMTs, our bus drivers — this is not an abstract issue. We don't want them fired."
 House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., predicted an agreement would be reached "soon."
 "I am pleased to report that we have been engaged in bipartisan negotiations on our interim legislation, and our progress is encouraging," she said in a letter late Saturday to Democratic colleagues.
 Republican Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, who leads the National Governors' Association, said he and other governors believe that aid for state and local government is "desperately needed,'' but that it may not be an issue worth fighting over for now.
 "I don't think the deal is finalized yet," he said. "But, look, we do not want to hold up funding to these small businesses. And we hope that the Democrats and the Republicans in the Senate can come together in a bipartisan way and get something moving for the American people."
 Democratic New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said states needed money from the federal government to ramp up testing, and he blasted legislation that wouldn't provide it.
 "You have the president saying 15 times, 'It's up to the governors, it's up to the governors, it's up to the governors,'" he said. "And then they're going to pass a piece of legislation that gives you know what to states: zero, zilch, nada, niente. Whatever language you want to say it, nothing. But then how are the states supposed to do this?"
 The SBA loans, based on a company's payroll costs, offer owners forgiveness if they retain workers or rehire those who have been laid off. The law provides for forgiveness for companies in any industry — even businesses like hedge funds and law firms. There's a limit of $100,000 on the amount of employees' compensation that can be considered when loan forgiveness is calculated.
 While they wait, owners who are shut down or who've lost revenue have expressed unease about the longer-term impact the virus outbreak will have on their companies.
 "There's great pain out there," said Suzanne Clark, president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. "Every hour and day that goes by without this assistance is really hurting them."
 Mnuchin, Schumer and Hogan appeared on CNN's "State of the Union," and Clark spoke on CBS' "Face the Nation."
