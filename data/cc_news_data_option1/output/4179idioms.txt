They should also understand that keeping crèches on lockdown is a big challenge to working mums as no formal organisation closes at 1.00pm. So, where do they want the children to go to while their parents are still at work? Considering how other working mums are complaining, if they don’t go back to the drawing board on this issue, other challenges would arise from sending children home by 1.00pm without parental presence.”

“As for the false accusations made by some countries and media against China, I would like to point out that it is not China that is setting a ‘debt trap’ for Africa, and China refuses to wear this ill-suited label. Some years ago, when dealing with Africa’s debt problems, certain countries attached a lot of political strings and set standards and thresholds that many African countries could hardly meet. Their attempt to remodel Africa by taking advantage of the debt issue has been widely criticised by African countries. China has never been absent when it comes to supporting Africa. China will continue to strengthen communication and coordination with African countries and resolve the debt issue through friendly consultation,” he added.

London [UK], October 17 (ANI): England skipper Heather Knight has said that coming to play the Women's Big Bash League (WBBL) in Australia was not a straight forward decision for her but she decided to participate in the tournament because she did not want to miss it.   WBBL is slated to commence from October 25 and it will conclude on November 29. The competition will be played at a variety of venues around Syndey. The crowds will also be able to attend matches at varying levels based on capacity restrictions.   "I had to think quite hard about it. We spent a lot of the summer in a bubble at Derby and at one point there wasn't going to be any fitness equipment in the room, we weren't going to have a balcony, so I was considering if it was a good idea to come. But we are being really well looked after, we've got everything we need so we can prepare well as we can while being stuck in a room," ESPNCricinfo quoted Knight as saying.   "I had a lot of cricket and training at the backend of the summer so was ready for a week or so off but trying to keep the loads up is the hardest thing. I've got a cushion on the top of my bed which I've been throwing into, although I did miss it the other day, so I was a bit worried about the state of the plasterboard but luckily it hasn't gone through. Not being a seamer it's a little bit easier to get back into batting and I'll just be trying to throw myself into it nets," she added.   Knight is coming to the end of two weeks in hotel quarantine ahead of linking up with her WBBL side, the Sydney Thunder.  
 "With the uncertainty around the cricket calendar for the next year or so - or maybe longer - I'm at the stage of my career where I'd much rather be playing than back at Loughborough [the ECB academy] training. There are a few extra sacrifices to make this year, families and partners can't come out, so that was one of the hard parts of the decision but I'm looking forward to getting stuck in. I didn't want to miss it," Knight said.   All the WBBL teams will be based in a 'village' at the Sydney Olympic Park and all the WBBL matches will be spread across five venues in Sydney.   The England skipper Knight had spent four seasons with Hobart Hurricanes and now she will be linking up with Sydney Thunder.   "I think it will be good for me to fit into a new environment and try and learn. I've got Rachael Haynes as a captain who is a player I massively respect so looking forward to working with her," Knight said.   On the opening day of WBBL, a total of four matches will be played. The first match of the tournament will be played between Melbourne Renegades and Melbourne Stars.   Sydney Thunder will lock horns with Sydney Sixers in their first match of the tournament on October 17. (ANI)

Abu Dhabi [UAE], October 17 (ANI): After stumbling to an eight-wicket loss against Mumbai Indians, Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) skipper Eoin Morgan said that there will be a smooth transition of leadership from Dinesh Karthik to him.   Prior to the match against Mumbai Indians, KKR announced that Dinesh Karthik decided to hand over the captaincy reins to Morgan in order to focus on his batting.   Mumbai Indians chased down the total of 149 with eight wickets in hand and 19 balls to spare against KKR on Friday at the Sheikh Zayed Stadium in Abu Dhabi. Quinton de Kock top-scored for the Rohit Sharma-led side as he played an unbeaten knock of 78 runs.   "I think within a team of leaders, given that Dinesh and me were titled leaders in terms of being the captain and vice-captain, I think there will be a smooth transition from here. It took a lot of courage for DK and a lot of selflessness from him to come ahead and recognise within himself that he needed to focus on his batting for the remainder of the tournament," said Morgan during the post-match press conference.   "I became captain, it is a very good opportunity for me to lead the team, but as I said within our group, we have a number of leaders who we will need throughout this tournament," he added.  
 Batting first, KKR posted a total of 148/5 in the allotted twenty overs as Pat Cummins and Eoin Morgan played knocks of 53 and 39 respectively.   At one stage, KKR found itself at 61/5, but from there on, Cummins and Morgan retrieved the innings for the side by stitching together an unbeaten stand of 87 runs. For Mumbai Indians, Rahul Chahar returned with the best bowling figures (2-18).   "With the bat, we made a few mistakes, I thought Mumbai Indians bowled really well and they proved why they have been one of the form teams in this year's tournament. From here on end, we have an area of improvement where we need to make strides on. We are at the halfway mark in this tournament and there is no better time to turn things around," said Morgan.   "We look at Pat Cummins as an all-rounder, I think the thing he has really been focusing this year has been his golf, that has made a huge difference in his batting and striking, he has been hitting the golf ball really well," he added.   KKR will next lock horns with SunRisers Hyderabad on October 18 while Mumbai Indians will face Kings XI Punjab on the same day. The Eoin Morgan-led side is currently at the fourth place in the points table with eight points from eight games. (ANI)

The Budget Plan breaks down that this year public spending will skyrocket to 53% of GDP, the highest percentage since the 1990s. In 2021, it will be reduced to 48%, although in absolute terms there will be an increase of 2,419 million more due to the vigorous rebound of the economy, which, even so, will not be enough to return to pre-crisis levels. Public revenues will also fall next year to 40.3% of GDP, compared to 41.7% in 2020. In this case, they will also increase in absolute terms, with an additional 33,447 million.

So if there’s ever a time to do it, now is the time.”
 The authors point to a greater risk if steps aren’t taken in the near term to avert exponentially increasing economic damage in the long term – and made permanent so they’re in place for future pandemics.
 “Recessions feed on themselves,” they write. “Workers not at work have less to spend, and thus subsequent business revenue declines.” By placing thousands of dollars in the hands of families and augmenting unemployment benefits, the CARES Act averted what might well have metastasized into “what likely would have been a new Great Depression.”

Blame misplaced in county commission election flap
   
 The Chatham County Elections Board and the Chatham County Commission candidate, Tony Riley, are shooting the messenger when it comes to Riley's potential election disqualification over a drug-related felony conviction. Riley's transgressions were revealed by Carry J. Smith, who discovered the disqualifying information. Yet the Elections Board and Riley refuse to place blame where it belongs, on the candidate himself and his political party.
   
 A news article published Oct. 14 states that "background checks are performed by their affiliate political parties." Did the Chatham County Democratic Party do a background check? If so, why didn't it discover a felony conviction of less than 10 years ago? The newspaper should have asked those two questions before running the story.

 Too much attention given to Senate candidate
   
 The Oct. 11 edition of the Savannah Morning News featured a multi-page political ad thinly disguised as a news article about U.S. Senate candidate Rev. Raphael Warnock's campaign visit to Savannah, his "native city" as reporter Nick Robertson puts it. But isn't a half-page (in color) on the paper's front page, plus a full page on the back of that section, and another half-page (also in color) inside the section a bit of overkill? Wouldn't the same amount of space cost Rev. Warnock's campaign over $5,000 if purchased as an ad? I am sure he must be grateful for the donation.
   
 Surely, in all fairness for non-partisan coverage, shouldn't other major candidates receive a proportionate amount of positive coverage? There is still time.
   
 Perhaps the Savannah Morning News plans to officially endorse Rev. Warnock before the election. But, in light of Sunday's glowing "report," the endorsement will be anticlimactic.

Abu Dhabi [UAE], October 17 (ANI): After registering a comprehensive eight- wicket win over Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR), Mumbai Indians' wicket-keeper batsman Quinton de Kock said that the side is not thinking about the playoffs and is just taking it one game at a time.   With this win, Rohit Sharma-led Mumbai Indians went to the top of the IPL standings with 12 points from eight matches.   Mumbai Indians chased down the total of 149 with eight wickets in hand and 19 balls to spare against KKR on Friday at the Sheikh Zayed Stadium in Abu Dhabi. Quinton de Kock top-scored for the Rohit Sharma-led side as he played an unbeaten knock of 78 runs.   "We did not plan much before this game, we know what are our strengths, it is a matter of doing what we have been doing, in our team we have a lot of experience and it is a matter of just doing the things on the field," said de Kock during the post-match press conference.   "The preparations for playoffs have not started yet, it is about taking one game at a time, whatever happens, we have to keep it simple and we need to play to our strengths. Whether we qualify for the playoffs or not, that is not in our hands but playing good cricket is something we can control," he added.  
 Batting first, KKR posted a total of 148/5 in the allotted twenty overs as Pat Cummins and Eoin Morgan played knocks of 53 and 39 respectively.   At one stage, KKR found itself at 61/5, but from there on, Cummins and Morgan retrieved the innings for the side by stitching together an unbeaten stand of 87 runs. For Mumbai Indians, Rahul Chahar returned with the best bowling figures (2-18).   "I think the process is that we have backed Rahul Chahar. He backs himself too and that is a key in a player. He knows his talent and he knows if he has a bad game, he will come back stronger and we know that too. As a player, we can just back other players," de Kock said.   "We like to play simple cricket, we have a great bunch of players, guys understand that they do not think too far ahead. To be honest, we do not really talk about the wicket, we like to assess things and rather be proactive and deal with what we have in front of ourselves," he added.   KKR will next lock horns with SunRisers Hyderabad on October 18 while Mumbai Indians will face Kings XI Punjab on the same day. (ANI)

With the landmark Brown vs. Board of Education Supreme Court ruling in 1954, the institutional racism plaguing public schools in America was first addressed. Unfortunately, implicit and explicit racism abounds in schools today. In light of police brutality and subsequent protests, it is perhaps more crucial than ever to disseminate standards of equality and justice through our public schools. Schools are an ideal place to instill values of equality and inclusion in the next generation. More specifically, an organic, effective place to start this positive change is in classroom libraries by paying attention to diversity in book collections.

Two Democrats and one Republican are running for two spots on the Plymouth County Commission.
 Of the two Democrats in the race, Greg Hanley, 54, of Plymouth, is the incumbent.
 The other Democrat, 62-year-old Jack Riordon of Marshfield, was a county commissioner for three terms between 2000 and 2012.
 Rockland Rpublican Jared Valanzola, 32, ran unopposed in his primary.
 The second seat up for grabs is being vacated by Republican Daniel Pallotta, of Hanover. Hanley and Riordan were the top two vote-getters in the primary.
 Valanzola said he has a background of working in town government, including his elected position on the Rockland Planning Board, where he has served for the past five years. He formerly worked in the statehouse for Weymouth Mayor Robert Hedlund, when he was in the State Senate.
 Valanzola said he is fair-minded and he has his own ideas, but that Plymouth County government is not hyper partisan. His relationships with other elected and government officials are key and will allow him to "hit the ground running," he said.
 Valanzola said he knows how to manage budgets and do more with less, something he also sees as a facet of his party affiliation. He said he wants to help regionalize services for the 27 towns in the county's borders, a goal that all three candidates expressed.
 Hanley said he has a long history in government, from his time as a selectman in Pembroke and previously as city councilor in Quincy. He was elected to the county commission in 2012 and again in 2016. If reelected, he said, it will be his last term. Hanley said when he was elected, the county was at its lowest point and "poised to be taken over by the state."
 He said his greatest achievements on the commission have been securing $90 million in federal CARES Act money to distribute to the 27 communities in the county. Hanley said his other accomplishments include creating regional purchasing agreements for towns to get discounted rates on vehicles and the retirement of some debt obligations.
 Going forward, Hanley said, he wants to create housing for homeless veterans and expand regional trash collection and regional solar collaboration. He also said he wants to retire the county's debt, $17 million.
 In 2010, Riordan called for the dissolution of county government, calling it an unnecessary third layer of government and advocated handing its responsibilities to the state.
 Now, Riordan, a personal injury attorney, wants to be county commissioner again. He said he never called for the dissolution of the county government but, instead, he just wanted the state to take over the jail because the county was ill-equipped to handle the responsibility. Other programs, such as 4-H, should be administered by the county, he said.
 He said the role of county government should be performing functions that the cities and towns inside of it don't have the resources to do themselves. He wants to create a regional water entity to protect the water supply in Plymouth County because aquifers don't follow town borders.

“Defensively, we knew we were going to have our hands full,” said Lorena coach Ray Biles. “They’ve got good athletes and have been hanging a lot of points on people. Our defense felt we had something to prove and they played well.”
