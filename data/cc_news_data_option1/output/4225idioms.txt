GABORONE, Oct 20 (Reuters) - Botswana's economy will rebound and grow 7.7% in 2021 from a 8.9% contraction forecast this year, on the back of improved sentiment in the global diamond industry, the finance minister said on Tuesday.
 Botswana's economy shrank by 24% in the second quarter of 2020 as coronavirus lockdowns at home and abroad slowed domestic economic activity and severely constrained diamond sales. Buyers of the precious gem were locked out of the capital Gaborone, where they come to purchase diamonds from De Beers.
 Mining is the sparsely populated southern African country's biggest revenue earner and accounts for just under 20% of total gross domestic product.
 "Recent months have seen a robust recovery in the international diamond industry, which will hopefully underpin strong growth in Botswana next year and help to boost exports and fiscal revenues," Finance Minister Thapelo Matsheka said during a World Bank online meeting held late on Monday.
 "Based on these developments, we are forecasting a GDP growth rate of 7.7% in 2021," Matsheka told World Bank Vice President for Eastern and Southern Africa, Hafez Ghanem, during the meeting.
 Global firm De Beers, which gets about 70% of its supply from Botswana, said last week it had seen a 57% jump in sales to $467 million at its September "Sight" - when selected buyers come to view and purchase goods already priced by De Beers.
 The firm cited higher retail orders ahead of the holiday season. (Reporting by Brian Benza Editing by Mfuneko Toyana, Editing by William Maclean)

 BRUSSELS, Oct 20 (Reuters) - Belgium could be returning to full lockdown if there is no reversal of the surge in COVID-19 infections and hospital admissions, a senior Belgian virologist said in a newspaper interview on Tuesday.
 "We would then have to consider even more restrictive measures, which could resemble a lockdown like the one imposed in March and April," Yves Van Laethem told La Derniere Heure.
 Van Laethem, who addresses national news conferences on the COVID-19 situation, said only an eventual vaccine or effective treatment would overcome the pandemic.
 As cases surge again in Europe, Ireland imposed some of Europe's toughest COVID-19 constraints on Monday, while Wales is set to begin a two-week "fire- break" lockdown on Friday.
 Health Minister Frank Vandenbroucke said on Sunday that the Belgian capital Brussels and the southern region of Wallonia were "close to a tsunami", with a health situation worse than anywhere else in Europe.
 He said a tsunami would mean authorities had lost control of the situation, meaning all non-COVID healthcare procedures would need to be postponed.
 The country of 11 million people reported on Monday a daily average of 7,876 new infections in the week to Oct. 15, with an average 252 hospital admissions and 30 deaths.
 At the peak of the spring coronavirus wave at the end of March, more than 600 were admitted to hospital in one day in Belgium. (Reporting by Philip Blenkinsop, Editing by Gabriela Baczynska)

LaFleur tried using Aaron Jones in place of Ervin early, and even had some mild success in the running game because of it, but they abandoned almost all motion in the second quarter and from that point forward, Tampa dominated.

There is no doubt that so-called "big data" and artificial intelligence can increase efficiency and productivity in the workplace enormously, but mathematical modelling used in various contexts without sufficient oversight can also lead to significant problems.
 Horror stories abound about algorithms in the workplace, many of them justified. From hiring to firing, algorithms dictate which candidates are interviewed and subsequently hired, determine working pace or style, outline acceptable (and unacceptable) productivity and – in some instances – determine who will face the chopping block. All too often, it remains unclear the extent to which machines have had a hand in such decisions and, rightly or wrongly, this is becoming the norm.
 On the other side of this equation (pun intended), there is still a lot of work that needs to be done in order for the inclusion of algorithms in all forms of managerial decision-making to be unbiased. This is not easy when "adding a touch of AI" is a sales phrase that means algorithms are often "off the shelf". These off-the-shelf solutions often lack the necessary feedback loops that could limit negative and unfair algorithms being left making harmful decisions.

We’re now on Day 7, and Team Biden still hasn’t taken any position on authenticity — and it’s starting to look very much like they’re ducking it.

Under the current statutes, marijuana is decriminalized in Madison when possessed or used in one’s private residence. That has been true since 1977, when the City Council of the time stripped the Madison Police Department (MPD) officers of their discretion when charging people for possession of cannabis in a private space—but not in public. To this day, while MPD officers have to turn a blind eye to small-time private possession, it is left to their discretion whether to issue a citation for public possession.

Cooper Clarke, an acclaimed punk-poet and Ronnie Wood lookalike, who rose to fame in the 1970s, says he likes collaborating with brands. “People get very snarky about advertising, especially with the poets for some reason,” he tells _Campaign_. “You might as well believe that if somebody takes your photograph, they’ve stolen your soul.”
 The author of poems including _Get Back on Drugs, You Fat Fuck_ and _Evidently Chickentown_ has a pragmatic approach. “Advertising is where poets go to work,” Cooper Clarke says.
 “I’ve never recommended nothin’ I wouldn’t eat myself – Domino’s Pizza, McCain Oven Chips, all of them written in my style. These days copywriters are just sensational, it’s as though I had written it myself.”
 Ahead of the publication of his autobiography, _I Wanna Be Yours_ , on 15 October, Cooper Clarke recalls one of his earliest and more memorable forays into advertising in 1988, when he became the Honey Monster’s first sidekick in a pair of ads for Sugar Puffs.
 “I used to be a Sugar Puffs fan, but I kind of put myself off it,” Clarke says. “When you’re doing them ads, you find yourself surrounded by little dishes all over the place, and you get a bit peckish as the days go on.”
 Directed by Willie Smax (who also directed the video for the George Harrison song _Got My Mind Set on You_ ), the ad shows a spindly Cooper Clarke and a gang of bright-eyed children as they recite the Snappy Badges song – “Stick ‘em on your jumper, stick ‘em on your thumb, stick ‘em in your earhole, stick ‘em on your boot.”
 “I didn’t make the rhyme, but I wish I did,” Cooper Clarke says.
 Some of the new wave of younger, quick-tongued poets are also happy to consider working with brands.

Since bay scallops no longer existed in Virginia, we obtained broodstock from North Carolina, which we have reared and released annually since 2013.

 So why can’t they coach? Why were all 32 teams in the 2018 World Cup coached by men while nine of the 24 teams in last year’s women tournament led by female coaches?
 There are differences between the men’s and women’s games, sure. The men’s game is faster and more physical, for example. But the objectives, the strategies and the Xs and Os remain the same.

The most clear-cut example of this, though rudimentary when thinking about today’s algorithms, is also a warning. In the 1980s, St George’s Medical Hospital School in London wanted to refine the lists of job applicants, due to overwhelming numbers. The AI was optimised towards efficiency – looking for candidates similar to those they’d previously hired – and overwhelmingly identified white males. A few years after its release, the British government’s Commission for Racial Equality found the medical school guilty of racial and gender discrimination.
 It’s clear, then, that automating decision-making can lead to mistakes. Yet despite this knowledge, dystopian warnings of over-zealous control by machines are fast-becoming reality.
 Liam Brown’s 2017 book _Broadcast_ touches on a world where we all wear chips that optimise our productivity, and companies use this to leverage algorithms in order to know how good you are at your job. This world seems to have arrived. Peakon, an employee-retention platform, has become a fully-fledged "software as a service" for employee retention, claiming to tackle employee engagement with actionable insights to prevent employee problems before they arise. Now we’re all talking about "work life balance" and "mental health" in the same breath as seeking optimal productivity – so much so that even going to the loo a few too many times is potentially a red flag.
 Already, in warehouses the world over, supposedly intelligent machines are managing humans and making work more gruelling, less rewarding and potentially dangerous in the process. In late 2019, Amazon put in place technology that could automatically fire the least productive employees. And nowhere is this risk more evident than in the gig economy, right now. Uber could not exist without algorithms, after all.

In the late 1990s, local residents told two of us who are longtime students of seagrasses (Robert "JJ" Orth and Karen McGlathery) that they had spotted small patches of eelgrass in shallow waters off Virginia's eastern shore. For years the conventional view had been that seagrasses in this area had not recovered from the events of the 1930s because human activities had made the area inhospitable for them.
