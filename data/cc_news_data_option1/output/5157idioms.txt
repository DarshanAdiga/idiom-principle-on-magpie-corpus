Despite carrying around a few extra layers of business, _Doom Eternal_ feels good. It is physically, mentally and emotionally a much-needed jolt out of all the ruts I’ve been stuck in—a shot of manufactured, harmless stress to take my mind off all the real stresses of today. Visiting a fictional hell world will always be preferable to dealing with the hell world we’re actually living in. Doom’s ripping and tearing is more vital today than ever—and not just that which I visit upon my enemies, but, importantly, the torturous ways in which they rip and tear through _me_. _Doom Eternal_ is a two-way street—the doom I perpetrate and the doom I have to welcome with open arms. It’s a kind of penance, and I am ready to accept my punishment.

The specific charges against Marsh -- conspiracy and obtaining property under false pretenses -- expose him to a maximum of 10 years in prison, according to court records.
 The more Marsh cooperates in helping prosecutors with an ongoing investigation in malfeasance at SCANA that is said to involve others, the greater his chances are of a lower prison sentence, according to documents and evidence in the case.
 In July, Stephen Byrne, the number two top SCANA executive pleaded guilty to conspiracy charges in SCANA's downfall.
 Byrne's guilty plea was the first official confirmation that the failure of the nuclear project was not just due to simple mismanagement mistakes at a complex project -- one of the biggest ever undertaken in South Carolina -- but also resulted from criminal conduct at SCANA's highest levels.
 Byrne is now out on bond.
 Both Byrne and Marsh will be sentenced at a later date.
 Federal prosecutors in the case are Emily Limehouse, Brook Andrews, Winston Holliday and Jim May. State attorney general prosecutors on the case are Don Zelenka, Creighton Waters and David Fernandez.
 Marsh's lawyers are Robert Bolchoz of Columbia, and Brady Hair and Derk Van Raalte IV, both of Charleston.

 LONDON, Dec 15 (Reuters) - London's theatres will shut again on Wednesday as the British capital moves into the toughest level of coronavirus restrictions, with some forced to close Christmas shows just days after they opened, in a hammer blow for the industry.
 The government on Monday announced that the rate of coronavirus infections was rising exponentially in London and all hospitality and indoor entertainment would close, giving the industry two days notice.
 "It's a huge blow for the casts, for the crews, for the creative teams. You know, a huge amount of money has been invested in getting these Christmas shows up and running, and now they have to close," said Julian Bird, chief executive of the Society of London Theatre.
 About 30 theatres are open in London, he said, ranging in size from small pub theatres to massive auditoriums.
 After an extremely difficult year many theatres had adapted their premises and shows to be COVID safe with reduced capacity, socially distanced seating, and temperature checks at the door. Audiences felt safe, he said.
 Louis Hartshorn, chief executive officer of Hartshorn-Hook Productions said: "It's a hammer blow to an industry that's already on its knees ... we have managed to put together a production expecting that there might be some twists in the road. But actually, we're getting to the point where the reserves are exhausted."
 His company's production of The Great Gatsby reopened in October, but now faces its second shut down in two months.
 Theatres all over Britain felt the same, he said.
 London's theatre scene is slightly bigger than Broadway in New York, with just over 15 million attendances in 2019, according to the Society of London Theatre's box office data.
 The city's theatres saw revenue of nearly 800 million pounds last year, with the average ticket costing around 50 pounds.
 Out in London's West End theatre district on Tuesday for their likely last chance of seeing a show this year, Lisa and Carly Sandom from Essex said they were dismayed.
 "This is completely depressing. (I am) gutted for all the people that work for the theatres and the production. It's awful," said Carly Sandom.
 Jennifer Webb, also in London to see a show, said she couldn't understand why theatres must close but shops, packed with Christmas shoppers, could remain open. "Really the shops ... should be the places that are closed and the theatres, that are managing everything beautifully to get audiences in ... should be the places that are open."

Camley Esquer of Valley Union was also awarded first team honors being the only Blue Devil to do so. She was joined by teammate Lizet Sonke who was named to the second team and Baleigh Casady who landed Honorable Mention honors.
 Reagann Pavis and Alexis Lentz both of San Simon were picked to the second team while Stefanie Keil was awarded Honorable Mention honors.
 Miller, who is in her 27th year as head coach at St. David and has no plans of stepping down any time soon, said winning the Coach of the Year honor means a lot considering there are so many excellent coaches out there.
 “It’s not about me, I’m here for the girls,” she said. “Seeing them do well on and off the court is what makes me happy. I’m honored and privileged with these awards but I would rather my girls get the awards than me.”
 Miller says when coaching she tries to teach her players more than just volleyball.
 “They have to learn life skills that will help them after volleyball,” she said.
 The Tigers had a very challenging season this year dealing with not only COVID-19 but also a gymnasium that was not completed forcing them to play their matches in the school cafeteria.
 “This was a very challenging year for everyone this year,” Miller said. “I am extremely proud of my girls for all that they have accomplished. There were some challenges we faced early on. Fortunately towards the end we got everything figured out and they did an awesome job the weekend that we needed them to.”
 Miller remarked this will be a season neither she or her players will ever forget.
 The coach added for Murray to be a four-time winner as the Defensive Player of the Year says a lot about all that she does on the court.
 “She has really grown and come out of her comfort zone playing the libero role in such an amazing manner,” Miller said. “She did an outstanding job for us this past year. I am so proud of her.”
 The coach also praised the job Judd, one of her power hitters, did this past season.
 ‘She’s the spark plug that we need,” the coach said. “She just plays the front row but when she’s out on the court, she takes care of business.”
 Miller believes both players have the ability to play at the next level.
 “I need to sit down with them and see just how serious they are about this desire,” the coach said. “Playing at the next level is a whole new level of commitment.”
 Miller took a moment to praise Klump who was the captain on the court this year for St. David and the calming influence the team needed if things were not going well that particular match.
 “She did a great job of being our captain this year,” the coach said. “I love the game, I love being around the girls. I love seeing them grow and be able to take on responsibilities. My heart is still in it. These are my girls and I love nothing more than being around them.”

You probably need life insurance if your death would cause financial hardship to someone else. If the only coverage you have is through your job, though, you may not have enough.
 Fortunately, buying life insurance has gotten easier in some ways during the pandemic. Plus, coverage may be cheaper than you think.
 The rising COVID-19 death toll has led more people to at least think about their life insurance needs, and many have taken action. One in 4 Americans who have life insurance say they purchased or increased their coverage because of COVID-19, according to a NerdWallet survey conducted Oct. 29 to Nov. 2 by The Harris Poll. Many of those who purchased or increased their coverage were motivated by fear of being diagnosed with the disease (30%) or knowing someone who had (29%).
 A survey by insurance industry trade group LIMRA this summer found nearly 6 in 10 Americans (58%) say they have a heightened awareness about the importance of life insurance, and about 3 out of 10 (32%) who were shopping for life insurance said it was in response to COVID-19. The number of term policies, the most popular type of life insurance, rose 10% in the third quarter compared with a year earlier, LIMRA found. That was the largest increase in 18 years.
 “Obviously, the pandemic is making people much more sensitive to their mortality,” says Alison Salka, LIMRA research director. “So we see more people aware of the need for life insurance.”
 Still, LIMRA has estimated that 30 million American households don’t have coverage, and another 30 million don’t have enough. The average coverage gap between what people have and what they need is about $200,000, LIMRA says.
 “There is a perception about, ‘Well, I have it at work, and that’s got to be enough,’” says Marc Cadin, CEO of Finseca, another insurance industry group. “Most people have not done the work to really understand what would happen if they were to prematurely die.”
 Employer-provided life insurance policies are typically capped at certain dollar amounts, such as $20,000 or $50,000, or limit coverage to one to two times an employee’s annual pay. That may seem like a lot, but parents with young children may need 10 times their salary or more to replace their incomes until the kids are grown. (Other types of insurance you may get from your employer, such as accidental death or critical illness policies, generally are too narrowly focused to protect you adequately.)
 Even if your need is more modest — your partner requires your income to pay the mortgage, for example — an employer-provided policy might fall short. Plus, you typically lose your coverage if you lose your job, as many Americans have during the pandemic.
 Having your own policy means your beneficiaries will remain protected. And thanks in part to the pandemic, you may be able to get coverage faster and without a medical exam.
 Increasingly, insurers are automating and accelerating the application process, LIMRA’s Salka says. Instead of sending someone to your home to check vital signs and collect blood and urine specimens, some insurers are waiving exams or are exclusively using exam and lab data provided by the applicant’s physician. This trend was already underway, but social distancing and other pandemic challenges mean more insurers are adopting these practices, Salka says.
 Life insurance is often cheaper than people expect, Cadin says. A 30-year-old woman in excellent health might pay $193 a year for 20-year term policy for $500,000. A 40-year-old man, also in excellent health, might pay $341 for the same coverage.
 Term insurance covers people for a specified period of time, which is typically 10, 20 or 30 years. Term policies are significantly less expensive than permanent life insurance, which has additional features such as a cash value that can be borrowed against and that grows over time.
 But the higher costs of permanent policies can tempt some buyers to skimp on coverage. If you do need life insurance — and you probably do if someone would be financially impacted by your death — then your priority should be getting enough.
 How much is that? A life insurance calculator can help you refine your estimate. You may want to replace your salary for 20 or 30 years if your children are young, for example, and perhaps provide a college fund. You may want to add in your mortgage balance and any other debts. If you’re a stay-at- home parent or other unpaid caregiver, consider how much it would cost to hire someone to provide those services and for how many years. For example, your kids may need a full-time babysitter until they’re old enough for school and then a part-time one until they’re in their teens.
 Once you have a total, subtract your “liquid” assets, such as savings accounts, college funds and any life insurance you already have. That’s the amount of life insurance you should start shopping for, without delay.

Still, after ending his presidential campaign, Buttigieg endorsed Biden and spent much of the general election headlining fundraisers and events for the former vice president.
 Biden praised Buttigieg at a March event in Dallas, comparing him to his late son Beau Biden.
 "I know that may not mean much to most people, but to me it's the highest compliment I can give any man or woman," Joe Biden said at the time.
 Prior to running for president, Buttigieg had served as the mayor of South Bend since 2012. He did not seek reelection in 2019.
 During his tenure as mayor, Buttigieg in 2014 deployed to Afghanistan as an intelligence officer. Prior to running for office, Buttigieg was a consultant at McKinsey & Company in Chicago.
 Buttigieg came out as gay in a 2015 essay for the South Bend Tribune while serving as mayor. Later that year, Buttigieg won reelection.
 His expected nomination is a historic moment for LGBTQ Americans. Advocacy groups had been pressuring the Biden transition to make history and nominate an LGBTQ American to a top Cabinet post.
 Buttigieg often spoke about being gay on the campaign trail and for many LGBTQ Americans, he became a symbol of progress and his marriage to Chasten Buttigieg and presidential campaign normalized being gay and married in presidential politics.
 "Being married to Chasten has made me a better man," Buttigieg said of his husband in 2019. And he used their marriage, which just years ago would have been illegal, to fault Republicans like Vice President Mike Pence, the former governor of Indiana, who has a long history of comments of opposing same-sex marriage.
 "And yes, Mr. Vice President, it has made me closer to God," Buttigieg said. "If you have a problem with who I am, your problem is not with me. Your quarrel, sir, is with my creator."

Adds Prigozhin comment)
 By Jack Stubbs
 LONDON, Dec 15 (Reuters) - Rival French and Russian disinformation campaigns have sought to deceive Internet users -- and unmask each other -- in the Central African Republic (CAR) ahead of a Dec. 27 presidential and parliamentary election, Facebook said on Tuesday.
 Facebook said it was the first time it had seen such a direct battle of the trolls by competing foreign states on its platforms, with the rivals' fake accounts denouncing each other as "fake news".
 The company said it had suspended three networks totalling almost 500 accounts and pages for so-called "coordinated inauthentic behaviour".
 One network was linked to "individuals associated with French military," it said. The other two had connections to "individuals associated with past activity by the Russian Internet Research Agency", as well as to Evgeny Prigozhin, a Russian businessman indicted in the United States for election interference.
 The French defence ministry and military command did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Asked about the Africa allegations, Prigozhin, who has denied the U.S. charges, told Reuters in a message that he considered Facebook a CIA tool which took down pages to suit U.S. interests.
 Nathaniel Gleicher, Facebook's head of cybersecurity policy, said: "You can't fight fire with fire. We have these two efforts from different sides of these issues using the same tactics and techniques, and they end up looking sort of the same."
 Central African Republic's President Faustin-Archange Touadera is a Russian ally, a relationship often seen as a threat to France's influence in the French-speaking country where Paris had deployed 2,500 troops until 2016.
 Facebook said the two disinformation campaigns largely focused on the CAR, but also targeted users in 13 other African countries including Algeria, Cameroon, Libya and Sudan.
 Ben Nimmo, head of investigations at social media analytics firm Graphika, said both campaigns used fake accounts to pose as local people, sometimes sharing doctored photos.
 The French effort started in mid-2019 and pushed pro-French messages before targeting "Russian fake news", when Facebook shut down a Russian disinformation operation last year.
 A subsequent Russian operation attempted to promote Russian business and diplomatic interests, as well as Touadera's candidacy, Nimmo said. Later, the Russian accounts tried to unmask the French accounts that were trying to unmask them.
 Neither side built much of an audience in CAR, Nimmo added. "They looked like two troll teams arm wrestling, with nobody else really paying attention." (Additional reporting by Tangi Salaun in PARIS; Editing by Giles Elgood and Peter Graff)

During the upcoming second semester, schools will continue offering the already established mix of in-person and virtual learning while also allowing more in-person days for a small number of high school students.
 The matter was up for discussion during a Monday school board meeting after staff was recently directed to examine the possibility of increasing in-person learning at high schools. Some board members previously expressed interest in exploring the possibility of offering high school students four in-person learning days per week.
 Currently, students either attend school two days a week with three days of remote learning or participate completely remotely. Additionally, 65 special education students attend school in-person four days a week.
 Robert Hauman, the schools’ director of curriculum and instruction, explained there are 1,149 students at Culpeper County High School and 1,422 students at Eastern View High School. In the first semester, about half of those students are attending in-person two days a week.
 Those students are split into two “tracks” that see half of the students going to school Monday and Tuesday while the other half goes Thursday and Friday. While there is room to safely increase daily attendance, Hauman explained that combining the two tracks for a schedule in which these students would receive four in-person learning days presents issues. For example, he said classes generally consist of about 15 properly spaced students. If both tracks were combined, certain classrooms would reach capacity and some students would go to an “overflow area” of the school to participate remotely.
 “At that point, they might as well just be at home,” Hauman said.
 Therefore, Hauman told the school board that “we’re pleased with where we are.”
 “We’d recommend sticking with the model that we have for second semester at the high school level and give the schools permission to continue to add two- day or four-day for some folks who might really need the time, particularly seniors, to the four-day model,” he said.
 Hauman said principals see the need for more in-person learning and have asked for the discretion to allow certain students to attend school two or four days per week. Hauman noted that a lot of Virginia school divisions are implementing full-remote learning and Culpeper’s current model “is much more than several divisions have even attempted.”
 “Maintaining the current model would allow them to selectively add students until they reach their mitigation limits or until we get the green light to return,” he said.
 Even if four days of in-person learning were offered, Hauman said not many students or parents would be interested. He explained robocalls, emails and personal invitations offering more in-person learning have been sent.
 “Believe it or not, there are not droves of people beating down their door to come back to in-person,” he said.
 That may change, he added, when parents see report cards from the first semester.

On Tuesday, ahead of Clemson's matchup against Notre Dame in the ACC Championship this weekend, Swinney gushed over Lawrence's abilities as a player and a leader.
 And he credited the junior's poise in the spotlight.
 "If you're going to be a quarterback at this level, or the NFL, you better have some thick skin," Swinney said. "He's not afraid to disagree, even though it might make the thumb gangsters mad at him."
 Swinney, who was talking about Twitter and other social media users, can relate.
 The coach likes to speak, and speak candidly, and sometimes the things he says cause stirs online. Lawrence said he's learned from Swinney how to stay level- headed in the modern era.
 "He's under the microscope, so everything he says, people are blowing up and people are talking about," Lawrence said. "He doesn't let it affect him, what people are saying. He keeps his life simple. That's something I've learned from him that I've tried to do in my own life.
 "I've heard just about everything you could imagine, good and bad, both just as dangerous. I just try to ignore it."

Forward-looking statements are predictions, projections and other statements about future events that are based on current expectations and assumptions and, as a result, are subject to risks and uncertainties. Many factors could cause actual future events to differ materially from the forward-looking statements in this press release, including but not limited to: (i) timing, receipt and terms and conditions of regulatory approvals required for the proposed transaction that could reduce the anticipated benefits of the proposed transaction or cause the parties to abandon the proposed transaction; (ii) the possibility that Marvell shareholders and/or Inphi stockholders do not approve the proposed transaction; (iii) failure to realize the anticipated benefits of the proposed transaction, including as a result of delay in completing the proposed transaction; (iv) MTI's inability to integrate the businesses of Marvell and Inphi; (v) unexpected costs or liabilities relating to the proposed transaction; (vi) the ability of the parties to obtain or complete the financing or any refinancing related to the proposed transaction upon acceptable terms or at all; (vii) potential litigation relating to the proposed transaction that could be instituted against Marvell, MTI or Inphi or their respective directors or officers; (viii) the risk that disruptions caused by or relating to the proposed transaction will harm Marvell's or Inphi's business, including current plans and operations; (ix) the ability of Marvell, Inphi or MTI to retain and hire key personnel; (x) the ability of MTI to protect its intellectual property; (xi) risks related to MTI's incurrence of indebtedness in connection with the proposed transaction; (xii) potential adverse reactions or changes to business relationships resulting from the announcement or completion of the proposed transaction; (xiii) risks relating to the market value of the shares of MTI common stock to be issued in the proposed transaction; (xiv) risks associated with third party contracts containing consent and/or other provisions that may be triggered by the proposed transaction; (xv) the impact of public health crises, such as pandemics (including the COVID-19 pandemic) and epidemics and any related company or government policies and actions intended to protect the health and safety of individuals or government policies or actions intended to maintain the functioning of national or global economies and markets; (xvi) legislative, regulatory and economic developments affecting Marvell's, Inphi's or MTI's business; (xvii) general economic and market developments and conditions; (xviii) the evolving legal, regulatory and tax regimes under which Marvell, Inphi and MTI operate; (xix) potential business uncertainty, including changes to existing business relationships, during the pendency of the proposed transaction that could affect Marvell's, Inphi's or MTI's financial performance; (xx) restrictions during the pendency of the proposed transaction or thereafter that may impact Marvell's, Inphi's or MTI's ability to pursue certain business opportunities or strategic transactions; (xxi) unpredictability and severity of catastrophic events, including, but not limited to, acts of terrorism or outbreak of war or hostilities, as well as Marvell's, Inphi's or MTI's response to any of the aforementioned factors; (xxii) the risk of downturns in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry; and (xxiii) the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could give rise to the termination of the merger agreement.

On defense, Biden’s likely push to revitalize NATO may well spur greater trans-Atlantic cooperation in areas like technological innovation and industry. In fact, the newly published _NATO 2030_ report calls for a joint allied approach to emerging disruptive technologies and goes as far as explicitly urging NATO to develop something akin to the European Defense Fund — which is arguably the only tangible deliverable in European defense autonomy. Those who take a more contingent, pragmatic approach may see less of a need to push for European strategic autonomy in light of a U.S. administration that is committed to Europe and the trans-Atlantic relationship, and is intent on working with the European Union to revitalize the multilateral order. Those who take a more hard-nosed approach to European autonomy, however, may see Biden’s election as a kiss of death. No wonder French President Emmanuel Macron has been doing the rounds to warn about the dangers of European complacency in light of Biden’s election.

_Skater Xl_ is not so much a return to form for skateboarding games as it is a distillation of what made them great in the first place. Yes, it borrows its core control scheme (with a few minor changes) from the Skate series, but it adds an extra layer of challenge to it. The physics are more grounded, and it’s cool that the game minutely recreates some of the most famous skate spots in America—from the Radio Korea plaza to the Staples Center and the West L.A. Courthouse. The fact that _Skater XL_ is grounded in reality is not what makes it truly special. What makes it so compelling is that you can customize your skater with real skate shoes, pants, boards, and more. Okay, that is not what makes it so great, but it is cool nonetheless. What makes it one of the best games of July is how it just distills the pure joys of skateboarding into a deceptively simple experience. No real objectives or stories or challenges are in the game—just various levels, your skater, and their board. It is all one needs because skateboarding is boundless. Use your imagination, try to skate new spots, craft compelling lines, and then get lost in the simple-yet-fun in- game video editor.— _Cole Henry_

The breadth of its options makes each run an exciting, different time, and makes _Going Under_ a highly replayable roguelike that you shouldn’t miss. When you’re away from the keyboard for a second your character throws her weapon away, sits down, and starts scrolling on her phone. If I was bored in a dungeon, I would do the same thing! Little moments like that are found throughout the game, and showcase that _Going Under_ is plugged in and timely. A lot of the early game is goofs and fighting, but as you progress deeper through the dungeons it becomes an inspiring story about fighting back, unionization, and solidarity. These days it’s way too easy to get down in the dumps, doom scroll, and instantly complain about anything online; this game distracted me from that. It made me laugh, transporting my mind into a world where evil sentient emojis run a corrupt dating app, skeletons are motivational speakers, and goblins drink coffee from a pot.

The Atlanta Braves have invited the Augusta GreenJackets to be an affiliate team beginning in 2021.
 With the recent shakeup to the Minor League Baseball structure, it was expected that the GreenJackets could be looking for a new Major League club affiliate. The Braves also extended an invitation to the Gwinnett Stripers, the Mississippi Braves and the Rome Braves.
 “This is exciting and a huge win for the city and the entire CSRA,” said North Augusta City Council member Fletcher Dickert.
 “Being affiliated with the local MLB team will only increase the popularity of the GreenJackets and the venue.”
 The GreenJackets play in SRP Park in Riverside Village, a development that includes the baseball stadium, residential spaces, hotel and restaurants.
 The GreenJackets would serve as the Braves’ low-level Class A affiliate.
 "With this invitation, the GreenJackets are officially on the path to being affiliated with the Atlanta Braves. This has been a long process, and we gratefully await the official Professional Development License Agreement so we can finalize this partnership and complete what is a truly historic event for sports in the CSRA," GreenJackets President Jeff Eiseman said. "Never before has this market had ties directly to our truest home team, the Atlanta Braves. We couldn’t dream of a team we would want to affiliate with more. Thanks to the vision and leadership of North Augusta, SRP Park should soon be home to the Braves’ top prospects, and fans can see the future of the Braves right here on the river for years to come.”
 City Council member David McGhee said the new affiliation will help draw Braves fans from farther away in the region.
 “Our hospitality revenue from this affiliation will increase with even more regional visitors coming to the city.”
 Dickert said the city’s investment into SRP Park is a “major reason why we will continue to play ball in the CSRA.
 “This new partnership will only further the success of Riverside Village,” he said.
 The GreenJackets were previously affiliated with the San Francisco Giants for 15 years.
 “We are excited to invite these four teams to be part of the Braves player development system,” Braves Executive Vice President of Minor League Affiliates and Strategic Planning Chip Moore said. “The potential of having our four affiliates all within Braves Country allows our fans to follow their favorite players as they develop from prospects to major leaguers.”

A broader role for Defence Force personnel serving overseas is envisaged by the Government as part of the latest review of the military. Terms of reference for the commission were approved by the Cabinet yesterday and the body, which will be set up by the end of the year, will have to report back to the government by next November.Ireland begins its two-year stint on the United Nations security council in January and Defence Minister Simon Coveney said a big part of what they were planning to achieve would be built around peacekeeping, peace enforcement, post-conflict management and how the council responded to the threats of regions being torn apart by war.&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just the start of it&rdquo;, Mr Coveney said. &ldquo;If you look at what we&rsquo;re doing around development aid partnerships around the world, undoubtedly there is a link between security and development&rdquo;.The minister said that in the future there would be a lot more complexity in terms of policy making &ldquo;between our presence abroad as peacekeepers and soldiers who are managing a post-conflict region, helping to keep the peace through training or presence being part of our development partnership strategy&rdquo;.This was an exciting area to move into for defence policy, Mr Coveney added. He admitted that during the formation of this government, he had &ldquo;essentially looked for&rdquo; the defence portfolio. He said he wanted the defence job and he also believed there was a link between it and foreign affairs, as military serving abroad were ambassadors for Irish foreign policy.He said a recent example of the synergies between the two portfolios was shown in Ireland&rsquo;s response to the explosion, which ripped through the port in Beirut last August, working together to use the defence capacity to get PPE quickly to Lebanon, which was what they needed.After yesterday&rsquo;s Cabinet decision, Mr Coveney said the setting up of the commission was to ensure the Defence Forces were fit for purpose, both in terms of meeting immediate requirements and in terms of seeking to develop a longer-term vision for beyond 2030.This is against a backdrop of an overall goal of providing for the military defence of the state, contributing to national and international peace and security while also responding to dynamic changes in the security environment including new and emerging threats from cyber technologies as well as climate change.It is also intended that the Reserve Defence Force will be given a bigger role while the government has also indicated that, where necessary, legislation will be introduced to implement recommendations.The commission will be chaired by the former secretary general of the Departments of Agriculture and Justice, Aidan O&rsquo;Driscoll and includes leading national and international figures.After its work has been completed, the defence minister will consult with the public expenditure and reform minister on the establishment of a permanent pay review body, &ldquo;reflecting the unique nature of military service in the context of the public service&rdquo;.But all recommendations in that area must be consistent with national public sector wage policy.

Also open to the public is the Sleigh Bell Scurry, which has become a fan favorite each Christmas for guests, according to Glaser.
 “The Sleigh Bell Scurry is basically a scavenger hunt throughout Big Cedar Lodge where guests, family members, friends or whoever you want to do your scavenger hunt with you, will get a list of clues and you’ll find items throughout the property at Big Cedar Lodge,” Glaser said. “These items are actually decorating materials so you can put together a wreath at the end of the scavenger hunt. After you’re done decorating your wreath you can take those home with you as a special keepsake from your time at Big Cedar Lodge.”
 Out of all the fun activities people can enjoy during the Christmas season, Glaser said her personal favorite has become the Holiday Light Tour.
 “You’ll hop onto a tram tour that’s pulled by this tractor and you’ll get to experience 25 minutes of the over 1 million lights that we have at Big Cedar Lodge. It is the most magical experience. I took my 2-year-old daughter this year, and she was absolutely blown away,” said Glaser. “It’s one of those magical things that you sit back and you think, ‘You know, this is why we do this.’ We want to make magical experiences for all of the families or groups or couples, anyone that’s visiting Big Cedar Lodge during the holidays, because there is really nothing like it anywhere else.”
 In years past, many people began coming to Big Cedar Lodge to walk around and enjoy the Christmas lights on the property. Glaser said those people are what helped inspire the light tour.
 “People wanted to see how extensive the lights set-up around the property was, because it’s almost unbelievable until you get on that tram and see them all. It’s such a wonderful experience. Not to mention, if you go on the tram tour you get a complimentary hot chocolate,” said Glaser. “Afterwards we have this set up on the lawn where you guys take off from the tram tour and you can get another hot chocolate or s’mores or candy or anything you want and sit around the camp fire and just experience the magical holiday season with those you love the most, so I couldn’t recommend it more.”

 The NFL enacted intensive protocols last month to help mitigate and contain the spread of COVID-19 within the league.

The Branson Police Department is facing off against the Branson Fire-Rescue Department in one of the greatest games ever played, turkey bowling.
 On Thursday, Dec. 17, at 5:30 p.m. Branson Police Chief Jeff Matthews and Branson Fire Chief Ted Martin will take to the ice at The Holidays on Ice new ice skating rink at the Branson Ferris Wheel to play a game of turkey bowling. For the game, each of the chiefs will roll frozen turkeys into bowling pins on the ice rink, according to a press release.
 The fun-filled evening event will benefit the Salvation Army. Community members are encouraged to bring nonperishable food items or cash to fill the red kettle. For that generosity, The Holidays on Ice will give donors free skate rentals in addition to the local 10% discount for unlimited ice skating that evening, the release stated.

 The choice -- which represents the first time the President-elect has called on one of his former Democratic presidential opponents to join his administration -- vaults a candidate Biden spoke glowingly of after the primary into a top job in his incoming administration and could earn Buttigieg what many Democrats believe is needed experience should he run for president again.

 Libya has plunged into a military conflict between two warring governments since the ouster and assassination of the country's long-time leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011, with the Government of National Accord and the Libyan National Army controlling the western and eastern parts of the country, respectively.

 “Right now we’re just sitting tight and not scheduling anything until we hear what’s going to happen on Jan. 4,” Bohannon said.
 The committee did not discuss how many games or matches a team must play in order to be eligible for the playoffs. “No dates, so no decisions yet,” Bohannon said.

After finishing the adrenaline-pumping, 50-hour epic that was _Final Fantasy VII Remake_ , I was looking for something much shorter and lighter for my next game, and found just that in _A Fold Apart_. It’s a sweet puzzle game about navigating a long-distance relationship, and although I found the narrative to be a little too on the nose and the puzzles to mostly all follow the same formula, it ended up being the game I needed. Only around three hours in length, I was able to complete _A Fold Apart_ within just a couple days, and I let myself slip into a dream-like trance as I folded the paper and guided these lovebirds through their streams of consciousness. If I didn’t have the game included with Apple Arcade, I probably wouldn’t ever have given it a chance. But I’m glad I did, since its adorable art style and characters coupled with a calming and meditative gameplay loop helped calm some of the anxiety I’ve been feeling about the world. — _Joseph Stanichar_

Annika Sorenstam will return to active competition in January when she competes in the 2021 Diamond Resorts Tournament of Champions near Orlando, Fla.
 The tournament, which will be contested at Four Seasons Golf and Sports Club, will feature celebrities and previous LPGA Tour winners from the past three years. Celebrities confirmed to compete in the tournament include country music artist and songwriter Lee Brice, actor Michael Pena, former Major League Baseball pitcher Roger Clemens and comedian/actor Larry the Cable Guy.
 Former MLB pitcher John Smoltz has won the celebrity tournament each of the past two years.
 Sorenstam, 50, retired from active competition in 2008 after becoming arguably the greatest female golfer ever.
 She won a record 90 professional tournaments worldwide, including 72 on the LPGA Tour. Her 10 major championships included three U.S. Women's Open titles, with victories in at least one major over six straight years (2001-06).
 "I've taken out the golf clubs and dusted them off, and I've been playing a little bit and really enjoying it," Sorenstam said. "My son is 9 years old, and he has an interest in it. So it's been a good reason for me to go out and just hang out with him, and that's sparked my interest again. I just want to go out and make sure I can hit the center of the clubface again and see the ball go up in the air. So I'm super excited about that."
 Earlier this month, Sorenstam was named the next president of the International Golf Federation. She will replace the outgoing Peter Dawson as the head of the IGF effective Jan. 1.

 Watson will play on the defensive side of the ball for the Falcons, though he was a two-way starter for Riverside on both lines. On defense, he had 19 TFLs and seven sacks, domination that earned him first-team Division II All-Ohio honors this year.
 "It was a great season all the way around," Watson said. "We did stuff that had never before been accomplished at Riverside. We were knocked out of the playoffs earlier than we wanted, but the bond between the team and the staff was so strong. An amazing year all the way around."

A private school student who could not get a government medical college seat, despite scoring 565 out of 720 marks in the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET), has challenged the constitutional validity of the 7.5% horizontal reservation for State government school students.
 The petitioner, S. Pooja, 19, of Chennai, said the Tamil Nadu Admission to Undergraduate Courses in Medicine, Dentistry, Indian Medicine and Homeopathy on preferential basis to students of Government Schools Act of 2020 promotes mediocrity by reserving medical seats for those who score less in NEET.
 Claiming to be hailing from a lower middle-class family, Ms. Pooja said she had been trying to gain a government medical college seat since 2018, when she completed Class XII, scoring 1,113 out of 1,200 marks. But that year, she ended up scoring only 134 marks in NEET.
 She scored 420 marks in NEET in 2019, but did not succeed in getting a seat in a government medical college.
 This year, she scored 565 marks, but her hopes of getting a seat were dashed when the State government introduced the 7.5% quota.
 Stating that she belongs to a Backward Class community, she said it was unfair to reserve seats for government school students, who have scored much less marks than her, in both government and private medical colleges, after the government undertaking to pay their entire expense from the public exchequer.
 She contended that the government’s decision was directly repugnant to the objective sought to be achieved by the introduction of NEET. She also claimed that the classification of students, on the basis of the schools where they studied, lacked intelligible differentia, and, hence, was liable to be interfered by the court.
 A Division Bench of Justices Vineet Kothari and M.S. Ramesh admitted her writ petition and directed the government to file its counter affidavit by January 5.
 The judges said an interim order to reserve a seat until the disposal of the case could not be passed now, since the medical counselling for this year was almost over and a majority of seats had been filled up.
 When the petitioner’s counsel, R. Karthikeyan, urged the court to pass an interim order that admissions under the 7.5% quota this year would be subject to the result of the writ petition, the judges refused to do so. “We don’t want to let the sword of Damocles hang over the heads of these poor students,” the senior judge in the Bench said.
 Advocate-General Vijay Narayan opposed the grant of any kind of interim order. He said the law was enacted with the avowed objective of providing medical education to deprived sections of the society. Though 41.5% of all students in the State were from government schools, only 0.16% of them were able to get into medical colleges before the enactment.
 Concurring with him that there was a laudable objective behind the enactment, the judges said it also reflected the unsatisfactory quality of education provided in government schools. “Why don’t you increase the standard of education in government schools? In the United States, government schools provide better education than private schools,” Justice Kothari said.
 Replying to the judge, the A-G told the court that the government was working on those lines as well, and said Tamil Nadu was the first State in the country to bring in a law for reservations for government school students in medical colleges. He hoped that other States would follow suit since it benefits the poor and the deprived.

 A favourite dates back to 1982 when he and Tony Waiters broke into a stadium in the Azores to settle a bet.
 The Canadian Olympic team, with Waiters as coach and Sayer as head of delegation, had been invited to Portugal for the opening of a new national stadium after playing a game in Wales.
 Waiters had ended practice by stationing a low bench on the sideline, asking his players to hit it with the ball from about 30 yards out. At dinner that night, Sayer made the mistake of suggesting even he could do it.
 "(Waiters) stood up and said 'Guys, Bob has challenged us. I'm taking bets that he cannot hit the bench 15 times out of 20.'"
 Taxis were summoned for the trip to the stadium, which to Sayer's relief was closed. Waiters was undeterred, however.
 "I'm thinking I can see the headlines now — 'head of delegation, national team coach arrested,'" Sayer recalled. "So to cut a long story short, we climbed over the walls, broke into the national stadium and I hit 14 out of 15 of the shots.
 "Tony was an interesting guy. A character."
 Thirty-eight years later, Canada Soccer is honouring both men — the late Waiters with a coaching award in his name and Sayer, a former Canada Soccer vice-president, with induction into the Canada Soccer Hall of Fame.
 The Tony Waiters Coaching Excellence Award recognizes contributions to coaching in Canada for a minimum of 20 years. Waiters, who guided the Canadian men to both the 1984 Olympic Games and 1986 World Cup, died in November at the age of 83.
 Waiters, who was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2001, was "a monumental figure in Canadian soccer," said Canada Soccer president Nick Bontis.
 “Mr. Waiters played an important role both as a coach of our national teams as well as an instructor and coach educator," Bontis said in a statement. "He had an incredible influence on our game, our players and our coaches.”
 The first recipient of the new award will be announced in 2021 at Canada Soccer's annual meeting in Saint John, N.B.
 Sayer joins previously announced player inductees Karina LeBlanc and Brittany Timko Baxter in the Hall of Fame Class of 2020. Sayer, a Canada Soccer Life Member who served as vice-president from 1986 to 1992, will be inducted into the builders section at the 2021 Canada Soccer awards banquet as part of the organization's annual meeting.
 "I'm thrilled," Sayer said in an interview. "It makes all those years of going to meetings and moving motions, organizing leagues, challenging orthodox thinking — my wife wondering where I am half the time."
 Bontis called the native of Lunenburg, N.S., "an important early champion" who promoted women’s soccer and the creation of the national women's team in the 1980s.
 “Bob Sayer helped guide our vision for women’s soccer in Canada and part of his legacy has been the success of players like Karina LeBlanc and Brittany Timko Baxter, from winning a bronze medal at the London 2012 Olympic Games to each representing their country more than 100 times,” he added.
 Sayer left England for Canada at the age of 28, taking up a teaching position in Lockeport, N.S. Offered the chance to coach both the boys and girls teams, It was there that his passion for women's soccer began.
 "I was converted by the girls (there) … I was thrilled by their attitude, by their commitment, their love of the game, their ethic to work." he said.
 Sayer went on to become co-chair at Canada Soccer’s national conference for women’s soccer that led to the adoption of policies for the Women's national championship (Jubilee Trophy), the women’s national team and programs for the development of women’s coaches and referees.
 The Canadian women's team held its first national camp in July 1986 during Sayer’s first year as Canada Soccer vice-president.
 The team was made up of 16 top performers at a Winnipeg tournament. Sayer was head of delegation for its international matches against the U.S. that year in Minneapolis.
 "I'd no idea then what a thrilling ride that was going to be — Olympic fame, World Cup fame," he said. "One of my slogans is 'If you don't dare, things don't happen.' and we dared on a shoestring budget."
 He also travelled with Canada to the 1986 World Cup, 1987 World Youth Championship in Chile and the first CONCACAF Gold Cup in 1991.
 He and president Fred Stambrook were part of Canada Soccer’s delegation at the FIFA Congress that approved the launch of the FIFA Women’s World Cup. He recalls Stambrook standing up at the meeting to speak out successfully against a technical committee suggestion that the women play 30-minute halves and use a smaller ball.
 "Canada had influence right from the beginning," Sayer said proudly.
 He served as president of Soccer Nova Scotia from 1981 to 1984 and was the founding chair of the Nova Scotia Professional Soccer Society which established the Nova Scotia Clippers as an expansion franchise in the Canadian Soccer League in 1991.
 He also founded and coached Lunenburg Lasers SC.
 Waiters was a recipient of the Aubrey Sanford Meritorious Service Award in 1996 and named a Canada Soccer Life Member in 2019.
 The English-born B.C. resident served as Canada men's and Olympic coach for more than six years in two stints from December 1982 to February 1992 and until May 1992 as the Olympic/under-23 coach.
 The Tony Waiters Coaching Excellence Award is Canada Soccer's first coach- specific award that celebrates coaching and coach education over an extended period of time.
 Other Canada Soccer Awards are the Canada Soccer President’s Award, the Aubrey Sanford Meritorious Service Award, the Ray Morgan Memorial Award (referees), the International Achievement Award (referees), the Brian Budd Award, and the Canada Soccer Award of Merit.

Barr, who was serving in his second stint as attorney general, sought to paint himself as an independent leader who would not bow to political pressure. But Democrats have repeatedly accused Barr of acting more like the president's personal attorney than the attorney general, and Barr had proved to be a largely reliable Trump ally and defender of presidential power.
 Sen. Lindsey Graham, the Republican leader of the judiciary committee, told reporters at the Capitol he was surprised by the news.
 "I think he did an incredibly good job trying to repair damage done to the Department of Justice, trying to be fair and faithful to the law. I think he's got a lot to be proud of," Graham said. "He fought for the president where he could, as every attorney general and administration should, but he also didn't cross lines that he shouldn't have crossed." He said he was referring to disclosing the Biden investigation.
 Graham also praised Rosen as a "good man" who he said would "be an ethical leader and a steady hand" at the Justice Department.
 Democrats who had long criticized Barr did not lament his departure. "Good riddance," tweeted House intelligence committee chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who said the attorney general had "lied to cover for Trump, launched political investigations, subverted justice and the rule of law and violently cracked down on protestors."
 House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., who led an investigation of politicization of the department, said that "whomever Joe Biden chooses as the new Attorney General will have a tremendous amount of work to do to repair the integrity of the Department of Justice."
 Before releasing special counsel Robert Mueller's full report on the Russia investigation last year, Barr framed the results in a manner favorable to Trump even though Mueller pointedly said he couldn't exonerate the president of obstruction of justice.
 He also appointed as special counsel the U.S. attorney who is conducting a criminal investigation into the origins of the FBI's probe of the 2016 election that morphed into Mueller's investigation of possible Trump-Russia cooperation, following Trump's repeated calls to "investigate the investigators."
 Barr also ordered Justice Department prosecutors to review the handling of the federal investigation into Trump's former national security adviser Michael Flynn and then sought to dismiss the criminal charges against Flynn, who had twice pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI. Trump later pardoned Flynn.
 Barr's break from Trump over election fraud wasn't the first. Earlier this year, Barr told ABC News that the president's tweets about Justice Department cases "make it impossible for me to do my job," and tensions flared just a few months ago when the two were increasingly at odds over the pace of the Durham investigation.
 Trump had been increasingly critical about a lack of arrests and Barr was privately telling people he was frustrated by Trump's public pronouncements about the case.
 Trump was also said to blame Barr for comments from FBI Director Chris Wray on election fraud and mail-in voting that didn't jibe with the president's alarmist rhetoric.

It's hard not to wonder whether the current battle over a pandemic relief bill is a preview of the first two years of Joe Biden's presidency. Adam Jentleson, a former aide to Democratic ex-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, summarized the situation well on Tuesday: "On COVID aid, [Mitch] McConnell's goals appeared to be to inject the least amount of aid possible into the economy but still pass a bill before the GA runoffs, while preventing any hard deadlines that could force another round of negotiations next year. He's poised to achieve all three."
 McConnell wants his two Republican Senate candidates to be able to say they brought aid home to Georgia, while still leaving Biden with as big a hole as possible to dig the American economy out of in 2021. The Democrats, being Democrats, seem poised to accept a bill just slightly larger than the "skinny bill" McConnell has wanted all along--a $748 billion package that they and many economists previously dismissed as inadequate to the scale of the economic cataclysm that has accompanied the pandemic. Democrats started the process looking for over $3 trillion. (The legislation originates from a Bipartisan Group of Lawmakers, however, which makes it good by D.C. definition.) But the two parties are also apparently moving towards an omnibus government funding bill with a longer window--reportedly through September 2021--which will make it harder for Democrats to force Republicans back to the table through much of Biden's first year in office. If we are to climb out of this recession, and Biden's Democrats are to avoid a shellacking in the midterms and beyond, he'll likely need not just more COVID aid but a stimulus bill. Anyone looking to place a bet on whether we'll see that?

Washington.- El gobierno del presidente Donald Trump impuso el lunes sanciones a Turquia, su aliado de la OTAN, por la adquisicion de un sistema de defensa antiaerea de fabricacion rusa, una medida sorprendente contra viejo socio y que allana el camino para una mayor confrontacion entre las dos naciones en momentos en que el presidente electo Joe Biden se prepara para ocupar el puesto. La medida extraordinaria contra un aliado de tratado sucede en un momento delicado en las relaciones entre Washington y Ankara, que han estado en desacuerdo durante años por la adquisicion de Turquia de un sistema de defensa de misiles S-400 ruso, junto con las acciones de Turquia en Siria, el conflicto entre Armenia y Azerbaiyan, y en el oriente del Mediterraneo. Las sanciones, requeridas bajo una ley estadounidense de 2017 cuyo objetivo es contener a Rusia si el gobierno considera que hay causa significativa, añaden otro elemento de incertidumbre a la relacion en un momento en que Trump se aproxima al final de su mandato. La medida marca la primera vez que la ley, conocida como CAATSA, se ha usado para penalizar a un aliado de Estados Unidos. Antes del lunes, Estados Unidos habia expulsado a Turquia de su programa de entrenamiento y desarrollo del caza furtivo F-35 por la compra del S-400, pero no habia tomado medidas adicionales a pesar de las persistentes advertencias de funcionarios estadounidenses que desde hace mucho se quejan de que el sistema es incompatible con el equipo de la OTAN y un potencial riesgo para la seguridad aliada. "Estados Unidos aclaro a Turquia en los niveles mas elevados y en varias ocasiones que su compra del sistema S-400 arriesgaria la seguridad de la tecnologia y personal militar de Estados Unidos, y proveeria de fondos sustanciales al sector de defensa de Rusia, asi como acceso ruso a las fuerzas armadas y la industria de defensa turcas", dijo el secretario de Estado Mike Pompeo. "Aun asi, Turquia decidio continuar con la adquisicion y prueba del S-400 a pesar de la disponibilidad de una alternativa, sistemas interoperables de la OTAN para satisfacer sus requerimientos de defensa", dijo en un comunicado. "Exhorto a Turquia a resolver el problema del S-400 de inmediato en coordinacion con Estados Unidos", agrego. "Turquia es un valioso aliado y un importante socio en seguridad regional para Estados Unidos, y queremos continuar con nuestra historia de decadas de cooperacion productiva en el sector de defensa al remover el obstaculo de la posesion del S-400 de Turquia lo antes posible".

But even in quarantine, the pensive introspection of Parker's lyrics hit home; the "let's put off worrying about the future" anthem "One More Year" is about as close as 2020 ever got to hopeful. - _Steven Hyden_

If cases remain steady, 7-12th grade students could return to hybrid learning on Jan. 19. Students would likely remain in hybrid learning for about three weeks before a possible return to in-person learning. There is a distance learning period for pre-K-12th graders after Christmas from Jan. 4-15.
 Westrum also noted the positive news of the COVID-19 vaccine, which is first available to health care workers and people in long-term care facilities. There are limited doses available with additional doses available to the public possibly in spring or summer 2021.
 “We’re lobbying hard that school personnel will be in that next wave of essential workers and … that would help us a lot too to get the staff vaccinated as soon as possible,” Westrum said.
 The big question is when sports will return, and how having sports and students and staff at the school will impact one another. Hybrid learning in the fall along with sports created a tough situation in the fall, with schedules near the end of the season “miserable,” as Westrum and athletics director and dean of students Norm Gallant said. The winter sports are also all indoors with sports like wrestling including close contact. The indoor factor, which has less air circulation and people in a confined space, impacted fall sports like volleyball with an increased number of COVID-19 cases, according to Gallant.

For all Trump's unsupported claims of fraud, there was little suspense and no change as every one of the electoral votes allocated to Biden and the president in last month's popular vote went officially to each man. On Election Day, the Democrat topped the incumbent Republican by more than 7 million in the popular vote nationwide.
 California's 55 electoral votes put Biden over the top. Vermont, with 3 votes, was the first state to report. Hawaii, with 4 votes, was the last.
 "Once again in America, the rule of law, our Constitution, and the will of the people have prevailed. Our democracy — pushed, tested, threatened — proved to be resilient, true, and strong," Biden said in an evening speech in which he stressed the size of his win and the record 81 million people who voted for him.
 He renewed his campaign promise to be a president for all Americans, whether they voted for him or not, and said the country has hard work ahead on the virus and economy.
 But there was no concession from the White House, where Trump has continued to make unsupported allegations of fraud.
 Trump remained in the Oval Office long after the sun set in Washington, calling allies and fellow Republicans while keeping track of the running Electoral College tally, according to White House and campaign aides. The president frequently ducked into the private dining room off the Oval Office to watch on TV, complaining that the cable networks were treating it like a mini-Election Night while not giving his challenges any airtime.
 The president had grown increasingly disappointed with the size of "Stop the Steal" rallies across the nation as well as efforts for the GOP to field its own slates of electors in states. A presidential wish for a fierce administration defense led to TV appearances early Monday by Stephen Miller, one of his most ferocious advocates, to try to downplay the importance of the Electoral College vote and suggest that Trump's legal challenges would continue all the way to Inauguration Day on Jan. 20.
 Late in the day, he took to Twitter to announce that Attorney General William Barr was leaving the administration before Christmas. Barr's departure comes amid lingering tension over Trump's unsupported fraud claims, especially after Barr's statement this month to The Associated Press that the election results were unaffected by any fraud.
 In a Fox News Channel interview taped over the weekend, Trump said that "I worry about the country having an illegitimate president, that's what I worry about. A president that lost and lost badly."
 On Monday in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin — the six battleground states that Biden won and Trump contested — electors gave Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris their votes in low-key proceedings. Nevada's electors met via Zoom because of the coronavirus pandemic.
 Trump's efforts to undermine the election results also led to concerns about safety for the electors, virtually unheard of in previous years. In Michigan, lawmakers from both parties reported receiving threats, and legislative offices were closed over threats of violence. Biden won the state by 154,000 votes, or 2.8 percentage points, over Trump.

While there are a number of activities open to the public, some of the festive fun at Big Cedar Lodge is best experienced by those staying as guests on the property. One such activity is the Big Cedar Lodge Elf Visits.
 “You can schedule a real live elf from Santa’s workshop to visit your room and surprise your kids with stockings full of goodies,” said Glaser. “They like to read stories and they like to collect letters for Santa and deliver it back to Santa, and it’s just a very magical experience that we highly suggest if you have any kiddos or groups that want to have some fun at Big Cedar.”
 Glaser added that those who would like to receive a visit from the big man himself, can also schedule a visit from Santa.
 “Instead of an elf, we bring down Santa from the North Pole and he will visit your room personally to listen to all of your hopes and wishes for Christmas day,” Glaser said. “You can get a photo with Santa and also receive a special gift as a part of that experience as well.”
 Another popular Christmas surprise for children is the Breakfast with Santa event, which is held every Saturday in December before Christmas.
 “One of the other fan favorites, that is actually open to the public but is usually taken advantage of by guests of Big Cedar because it is pretty early, is Breakfast with Santa. You get to decorate a stocking, you get to enjoy pancakes and waffles and all of the fun foods that Big Cedar offers,” said Glaser. “You get to spend time with Santa. He walks around and visits all the tables, listens to all of the kids’ wishes, and it’s all lit up with Christmas lights, per usual. So it’s a real fun, magical experience for anyone visiting Big Cedar.”
 On top of all these hours of Christmas fun, there are still a ton of other adventures open to both the public and guests of Big Cedar Lodge. Additional Christmas activities include Baking with Mrs. Claus, a Kids Tree Decorating Pajama Party, Storytime with Mrs. Claus, Stocking Decorating, the Elf on the Shelf Scavenger Hunt, a Sunrise Santa Visit, a Gingerbread Build-Off, the Elves Winter Workshop and the Tree Lighting Ceremony, which is held each Saturday night in December through Dec. 21, and on Dec. 24.
 “All of our activities and venues, and anything you can think of for Big Cedar, is available to be rented for groups or family reunions,” Glaser said. “Anytime you want to get a group together for Big Cedar Lodge, we will personalize it to whatever your group wants and needs to do.”

With his heart racing, pumping “about 1,000 beats per minute,” Dylan Obowa lined up across 10 obstacles that stood between him and perfection. Those same 10 obstacles stood in front of him 11 times before this and 11 times before he sent them flying all around. As he began his walk, he stared at the maplewood barrier one final time.
 Silence.
 Then an explosion of cheers rang out as Obowa bowled his first 300 game Nov. 15 at Northern Aire Lanes in Fergus Falls. The 16-year-old competed in the United State Bowling Academy Flight Tournament at the lanes.
 “I'm not surprised at his 300 game at all,” Fergus Falls High School bowling coach Dean Paulson said. “He's put in a lot of time and effort to get to this point ... and he'll have many more down the road.”
 Obowa realized that he could roll a perfect game around the ninth frame. His prior best was a 298, two pins away from the feat. Being so close in the past still did not prepare him for that final 10th frame. As he approached the lane with his Motiv Venom Shock ball, things changed.
 “It felt like something out of a movie, going up to the approach with my heart pounding out of my chest, my hands and legs were shaking so much I thought I was going to fall over. When I threw the final ball It looked perfect out of my hand and it was. At that moment my mind went blank ... I didn't know what to feel. Then came a moment I'll never forget. I turned around to a huge crowd of people cheering for me and best of all, seeing all of my family and co- workers at Northern Aire Lanes share this moment of happiness and excitement with me ... I'll never forget it,” Obowa said.
 “Dylan is a humble but fierce competitor,” Northern Aire Lanes manager and coach Luke Loeffler said. “He has a strong desire to find a way to score no matter what the lane conditions are. Dylan is one of the most dedicated junior bowlers in my times of junior bowling.”
 “Dylan is a great kid. He has a passion for the sport that is second to none. He works hard on his game at practice, and puts his heart into every competition. As a coach, you cannot ask for more than that,” Paulson added.
 The six-game tournament saw Obowa finish with 1,328 pins, finishing second overall. The tournament is a traveling circuit that allows youth bowlers to earn scholarships and a chance to qualify for a spot at the Junior Gold National Tournament. Obowa bowls mostly in the Northern Division which includes other bowlers from central Minnesota and North Dakota.
 Obowa has been bowling competitively for about seven years and the rush of seeing a clear deck after the first shot is a major thrill for him. “I think the best thing about bowling to me is that feeling when you throw the perfect shot and out of your hand you know all 10 pins are going down, there's nothing quite like it,” Obowa said.

 Deputy Commissioner of Hassan R. Girish, at a press conference in Hassan on Tuesday, said elections will be held for 1,472 seats on December 22. There are 3,867 contenders in the fray.
 Among the seats for which there were no contenders for 33 are in Sakleshpur taluk. The Karnataka Growers’ Federation, opposing the implementation of Dr. K. Kasturirangan’s report on the Western Ghats, had called for boycotting the election to put pressure on the governments on this issue.
 “Our officers had visited the places and cleared the confusion over the impact of the report. However, people have not come forward to contest the elections in three panchayats – Hettur, Heggadde and Hongadahalla. Similarly, those people, who had filed nomination papers of Devaladakere, also withdrew them on Monday,” he said.
 The officer said he had spoken to representatives of Karnataka Growers’ Federation and warned them of legal action for the boycott call. “We have told them to give in writing if they had any worries about the Kasturirangan’s report. The State government has also given assurance that nobody would be evicted from their place,” he said.
 Holenarasipur, Arasikere, Belur and Alur taluk GPs will go for the polls in the second phase. Till Monday evening, there were no nomination papers for 354 seats in these taluks. “Wednesday is the last day to file papers for the polls in the second phase,” he said.
