Fabrizio Poncirroli   Antonello Riva è una leggenda del basket italiano. Medaglia d'Oro agli Europei del 1983, ha giocato con l'Olimpia Milano per cinque stagioni (dal 1989 al 1994). Oggi ha sposato il progetto di PM-International ma non ha smesso di amare la pallacanestro.   Antonello, corretto fermare tutto il basket?   «Se il basket avesse avuto la forza di ripartire che ha avuto il calcio, probabilmente le cose sarebbero andate diversamente. Mi rendo conto che far tornare i giocatori sparsi nel mondo per due mesi di partite sarebbe stato molto complicato».   Parliamo dell'Olimpia Milano che sta rivoluzionando il proprio roster.   «Sai, Messina ha pieni poteri. E' sia il coach che chi decide a livello di mercato. Lo scorso anno era un po' bloccato da contratti già in essere e ha dovuto adeguarsi a situazioni ereditate dal passato. Ora sta prendendo giocatori funzionali al suo credo. Ritengo che sia cercando di costruire la rosa giusta per il suo modo di fare basket».   Che ne pensa dell'acquisto del giovane Moretti da parte del club biancorosso?   «Giovane di grande interesse. E' andato a giocare in NCAA. Non una scelta facile, soprattutto per un giocatore italiano. Credo sia arrivato nel posto giusto al momento giusto. Con coach Messina avrà modo di crescere molto. Conosco bene il padre, non ho dubbi sul fatto che la scelta di andare a Milano sia quella giusta».   I tifosi dell'Olimpia sognano soprattutto l'arrivo di un fuoriclasse come Datome.   «Guarda, Gigi è un grandissimo giocatore. Penso sia uno dei migliori cinque italiani in circolazione. Ha già dimostrato quanto vale, vincendo anche tantissimo. Sono onesto, mi piacerebbe tantissimo vederlo giocare a Milano. Sarebbe davvero un grandissimo colpo per l'Olimpia».   Che basket sarà quello che vedremo post Covid-19, dopo questo terribile periodo di lockdown?   «Credo che andremo incontro ad un basket senza pubblico per diverso tempo e, rispetto al calcio, il prezzo da pagare per l'assenza dei tifosi sarà elevato a tutti i livelli. La mia speranza è quella di vedere almeno il 50% del pubblico all'interno dei palazzetti il prima possibile. Sarebbe vitale per tutto il movimento ritrovare, se pur parzialmente, i tifosi». Difficile ma non impossibile, speriamo abbia ragione Riva.   riproduzione riservata ®

Railways on alert
 The Mumbai Divisions of the Western Railways (WR) and Central Railways (CR) have taken a series of precautions in the city in light of the approaching cyclone Nisarga. While no trains have been cancelled as yet, railway officials said that they were monitoring the situation closely and would take call on regulating or short terminating trains if the need arose. The railways on Monday had partially resumed timetabled long distance services to several parts of the country with many trains either starting from Mumbai or being routed via the larger Mumbai Metropolitan Region.

Finally, if I assume that the company sticks to its average 2.5x leverage target by 2024, that would mean URI has an incremental $3 billion of capital to deploy - either on buybacks, or acquisitions, or both. By my calculations, buybacks are the most accretive use of capital (assuming only 10% after-tax ROIC on deals). Depending on the mix of buybacks or acquisitions, URI could see 20-30% accretion to my 2024 EPS number. Putting a 10x multiple on that and discounting back I get to a target of $185-211 in 2021. Using a more bullish 14x I get to $259-295.
 I feel confident that there is material upside for URI. My analysis suggests a reasonable base case target price of around $200, with a bull-case upside target of $250 looking achievable if all things go smoothly beyond 2021.
 The downside is to 4.5x EV/ EBITDA, which on my 2020 and 2021 estimates would point to $50 to $100. The $50 downside would be extreme, and would require sentiment to turn materially negative again about the prospects for the US economy - perhaps in response to a resurgence of the virus, a new lockdown, and with no vaccine in sight... This is still a possibility.
 However, if I use a 4.5x EV/EBITDA multiple on my out-year projections, I still see an 8% compounded return for investors each year, which is not bad in my eyes as a bear case.
 So in summary, from a valuation perspective, while I see risk to $50-100 on the downside, the upside for URI is to $200-250. This puts the risk at -64% to -28% in the near-term, with upside of +44% to +80% in the next 12-18 months.
 My sense is that the probability of the upside is currently higher than that of the downside, with the probability of the extreme downside looking more minimal in my view. The market is already looking forwards and trying to discount the scale of recovery.
 ## Conclusion
 I like URI as a company. I think it is often misunderstood, with the quality of the management team and its approach to running the business typically overlooked by investors hypnotised by the company's sensitivity to economic cycles. As a long-term investor, I have the luxury of looking beyond near-term cyclicality towards the secular growth story and the quality of the company's strategy. In particular, I like the strength of the FCF story, which provides the company plenty of options to create value - particularly in down cycles.

Kevin Holland (17-5) secured a 39-second knockout against Anthony Hernandez (7-2) in the middleweight division.
 — Giga Chikadze repeatedly pounded Irwin Rivera with kicks, taking advantage of his size advantage to win a unanimous flyweight decision. Chikadze (10-2) was on crutches following his fifth consecutive victory. Rivera (9-5) was a last-minute replacement for Mike Davis, who was removed from the card Thursday after suffering complications associated with cutting weight. Davis is the Titan FC bantamweight champion and was able to drive up from Miami on short notice.

When the Bundesliga resumes on Saturday following a two-month suspension caused by the coronavirus pandemic, Borussia Dortmund will already be without some key players.
 Dortmund coach Lucien Favre said Thursday that midfielders Emre Can and Axel Witsel will both miss Saturday’s game against Schalke, but said he hoped they could return soon. It will be Dortmund’s first game since March and will be played in an empty stadium.
 Favre didn’t say why Can and Witsel wouldn’t be available, but German media have reported that both have muscle problems.
 Dortmund is already without defender Dan-Axel Zagadou, who damaged a knee ligament soon after the club’s return to training last month. Dortmund captain Marco Reus hasn’t played since injuring a muscle in a German Cup game on Feb. 4 and his return remains uncertain.

However, one major sticking point for Ighalo is the return of Marcus Rashford.


  The Afcon 2019 top scorer joined the club in January largely due to their top scorer’s injury and the subsequent inability to get any of their striking targets, including the hugely talented Erling Haaland, who joined Borussia Dortmund.


  With the Englishman now back in the fold, it reduces the chances of Ighalo getting ample gametime. While the sheer frequency of games to play in limited time for the rest of 19/20 means appearances this year may not be affected, it’ll make for a fascinating watch how events pan out in the first half of next season.


  In fairness, looking that far ahead may be far too premature, but the options at the club in attack and the Red Devils’ long-standing desire to sign another frontman reportedly remains.


  Even though the uncertainty surrounding the summer transfer market gives Man United an insurance policy with Ighalo, still he’s behind Rashford, Anthony Martial and arguably Mason Greenwood in the pecking order.

Trump’s remarks follow Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s comments that the economy may need more help.
 “The coronavirus shock is also the biggest shock that the economy’s had in living memory,” Powell said on CBS’ “60 Minutes.” “And the question is, will it be enough? And I don’t think we know the answer to that. It may well be that the Fed has to do more. It may be that Congress has to do more. And the reason we’ve got to do more is to avoid longer-run damage to the economy.”

 “It’s been really encouraging to see how quickly businesses around the country have begun to ramp up,” Hassett told reporters.

I will start by summarizing three key points. First, CrowdStrike delivered another exceptional quarter, with results well exceeding our expectations across the board, including generating non-GAAP operating income for the first time. Our strong performance demonstrates our ability to execute at peak levels and protect our customers even in light of a global crisis. Second, we believe work from home and digital transformation, are sustainable trends for our business. It is mission-critical to protect workloads irrespective of where they are located on or off the corporate network. We believe these trends have helped increase our leadership in the security cloud category that we pioneered. And third, we continue to win new logos as companies are rapidly pivoting away from on-premise legacy technologies and moving to cloud-native architectures that provide prevention, visibility and control on a single platform. Additionally, the competitive environment has involved to our favor as market share of the incumbents continues to erode.

Cannon McIntosh was racing at his home track on Sunday night at Port City Raceway and the 17-year-old Bixby, Oklahoma-native certainly appeared to be right at home in leading all 30 laps from the pole position in winning the POWRI Lucas Oil National Midget League’s Turnpike Challenge finale. The victory was McIntosh's first in POWRi competition and his third overall national midget feature win. The triumph is the second in a row for Keith Kunz Motorsports (KKM) and Toyota after Buddy Kofoid was victorious on Saturday night at I-44 Riverside Speedway. It also marked the ninth for a Toyota-powered entry this season. With Toyotas owning the top three starting positions, pole-sitter McIntosh would go straight to the lead, with Tanner Carrick moving into second, while Buddy Kofoid slipped from second to third. After nine laps, it was McIntosh, Carrick, Blake Edwards, Tyler Thomas, Kofoid and Kaylee Bryson running in the top six, but things would quickly get shaken up when Thomas and Edwards got together between turns one and two while battling for third, with Kofoid being left with no place to go and having to come to a stop on the race track. That would send each to the back of the field. McIntosh continued to lead the field after the restart, but another caution came out on lap 12 with McIntosh, Carrick, Jake Neuman, Bryson and Tanner Thorson making up the top five. On the green flag, McIntosh and Neuman began to pull away from the field. As the laps began to wind down, they would eventually begin to hit heavy lapped traffic before the yellow waved once more to set up a six-lap dash for the victory with McIntosh, Neuman, Carrick and Thorson in the top four. On the restart, Carrick would use the top side to overtake Neuman for the second spot and began to close on McIntosh after the leader came up on a slowing car headed to the pits, but McIntosh recovered quickly and pulled back away from the field as the battle for second began to heat up behind him with Thorson able to pass Carrick between turns one and two on lap 26. Up front, though, it was all McIntosh as he went on to a comfortable victory, with Thorson finishing second and Carrick placing third to give Toyota two of the three podium finishers for the third consecutive night. “It has been a long time coming,” said McIntosh of his first POWRi victory. “We got our first USAC win early last year, but never really had the car to win in POWRi until tonight. The bottom never felt like it slowed down too much for me and never felt like I needed to use the top, but we were prepared if we needed to. I could never have done this without the entire Keith Kunz Motorsports team and Toyota Racing Development. It’s really special to have been on the podium each of the last three nights here in my home- state.” Joining McIntosh and Carrick in the top 10 among the Toyota contingent were KKM's Bryson in seventh and Tucker-Boat Motorsports' Andrew Layser in eighth. Overall, Toyota-powered entries would capture wins in two of the three Turnpike Challenge events, while also securing six top-three podium finishes with McIntosh earning a first, second and a third over the three nights. The POWRi Lucas Oil National Midget League is scheduled to be back in action with a pair of races at Lake Ozark Speedway in Eldon, Missouri, June 12-13. TRD PR

That doesn’t mean they weren’t excited to be back playing the game they love.
 “For the most part they came back with great attitudes, ready to work, everybody has been there, they are anxious to get going,” Mays said. “The coaches are anxious to get going, and so far they have worked hard and no complaints, they are just happy to be out there.”
 Much has changed in the post-coronavirus world of high school athletics. Social distancing, sanitizing and daily temperature checks are just some of the new requirements, along with the reality of no contact, which is especially strange for a contact sport like football.
 “As far as physical contact of player to player, that is not happening, but we have been able to get the green light to be able to throw a football,” new Sullivan East head football coach JC Simmons said. “We are going to have to clean it from group to group so they are split up into smaller groups and those groups have to stay the same for the month of June.
 “We were creative about it, not just pairing certain people together for no particular reason.”
 Tennessee High has been doing much the same, with each individual player using his own bar for lifting weights, while also remaining with the same teammates for agility and other drills.
 “Right now we have a couple of quarterbacks throwing to a different set of receivers because they are only allowed to stay around the same people all week and the same coach for contact tracing,” Mays said.
 Football isn’t the only sport benefitting from workouts. Nearly all sports and other extra-curricular activities are taking place at the Bluff City campus. That is why athletes like Luke and Jenna Hare are getting their share of work in.
 They are probably tired, but their efforts are certainly appreciated at a school that needs them.
 “With a school our size we can’t function unless we are sharing athletes,” said Andy Hare, who feels like the his staff of coaches have grown even closer in terms of communication during this two-month break from school. “We are a small school now. It is not the same school I went to number-wise. We are dependent upon the multi-sport athlete.”
 Simmons was as anxious as his players last weekend, waiting for his chance to finally get to meet up with his players and staff, having spent the previous weeks having to communicate via online options.
 “I just wanted to try to set the tone for this summer and this season the best that we could,” said Simmons, who was pleased on Monday with the condition most of his players reported in. “Our kids were really enthusiastic and excited to be there and I certainly was. I couldn’t hardly sleep [Sunday] night.”

“We are very pleased we made it through third reading,” said County Council Gary Bunker following the meeting. “This organization (828 Richland Avenue Associates) appears to be working very well with the our administration and Council, and also with the City of Aiken, on their proposed plans.
 “We are hopeful that we will have a contract with them in the next couple of weeks,” he continued. “And once we have the contract, that will start the 180-day due diligence phase. As it stands right now, we likely will not see any money change hands during the current fiscal year (which ends June 30), but I believe we look very good going into fiscal year 2021 for this project.”
 County Council voted unanimously to amend some language in the ordinance prior to considering approval of its third reading.
 In addition, a public hearing on the ordinance was held.
 Laura Bagwell, Dione Carroll and Mandy Drumming spoke and expressed their support for, in general, preserving the old hospital or at least the brick building’s front portion.
 Because the old hospital is in Aiken’s city limits, city officials “ultimately will deem what is going to happen there,” County Council Vice Chairman Andrew Siders said. “Just so everybody understands, the county, after the sale of the building, has no standing in what the city does.”
 The county failed to finalize previous deals to sell the old hospital for $1.1 million to The Marian Group in Kentucky and then to a local entity, WTC Investments LLC.
 In other action Tuesday evening, County Council unanimously approved the second reading of an ordinance that would establish the county’s budget for fiscal year 2021.
 The third and final reading is scheduled for June 16.

“To this day I am haunted by a game I played in Double-A in the Texas League against the El Paso Suns,” Shelton said. “The catcher said, ‘He’s going to throw a curveball first pitch.’ I looked down at him and he says, ‘No, curveball first pitch. Why would I lie to you?’ I didn’t know the catcher from Adam. The guy threw the most hanging curveball I’ve ever seen and I didn’t swing at it and I knew I could have hit it 400 feet. ... The catcher says, ‘That’s the last pitch I ever give you. If you don’t trust me, I can’t give you any pitches.’”
 And Nuke was actually a toned-down version of the real pitcher who inspired him: Steve Dalkowski, who died last month of the new coronavirus. Dalkowski threw harder and was even wilder — on the field and off — than the character.
 In retrospect, “Bull Durham” (released by Orion Pictures) was part of a golden age of sports movies. Every movie in AP Sports’ top 10 hit theaters between 1977 and 1992. Shelton credits Hollywood studios at the time for being more freewheeling and less concerned about the overseas market, where baseball in particular doesn’t sell.
 Even a director of Shelton’s pedigree can’t get a baseball movie made today. He has a script co-written with his “Tin Cup” collaborator John Norville about a pitcher trying to resurrect his career in Colombia that hasn’t found a home.

Un gran escándalo llevado a la televisión
 Lo que permitió la conspiración de sobornos por 150 millones de dólares, en la que Jadue hila una red manejada por el presidente de la Asociación del Fútbol Argentino (AFA) Julio Grondona, es una serie de maquinaciones que sin duda quedaron mejor contadas desde el humor. Al menos en los primeros capítulos a los que tuvo acceso Efe, es fácil imaginárselos como parte de una comedia disparatada.
 Sorprendentemente, "El presidente" también es una serie en la que las mujeres son las que mueven los hilos de un mundo considerado tan masculino como es el del fútbol.
 La actriz mexicana Paulina Gaitán encarna a María Inés "Nené" Facuse, la ambiciosa mujer de Jaude y el motor detrás de todos sus manejos.
 Por su parte, su compatriota Karla Souza, en su primer papel en español para la pantalla chica, tras su exitosa participación en "How to Get Away With Murder", es la única que caracteriza un personaje ficticio y representa a los agentes del FBI que destaparon el caso. Su interpretación no es solo sorprendente y compleja sino que le permite demostrar su habilidad con acentos e idiomas.
 Para poder disfrutar de la joya que es "El presidente", filmada a lo largo de cuatro meses en Brasil, Argentina y Chile, hay que aguantar la hermosa lentitud de los primeros dos capítulos y esperar hasta el cuarto episodio en el que la historia empieza a llegar al clímax.
 Bó consiguió hacer una serie tan suramericana como universal, con guiños culturales en los colores, la música y hasta la escenografía, perfectamente entendible y disfrutable para la audiencia, incluso o en especial, para los que no son fanáticos del fútbol.

Banks have been asking publicly for more time to implement the Trump administration’s changes, citing the pandemic, the millions of Americans behind on their debts, and that they’re trying to underwrite loans for the Paycheck Protection program.
 The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency is also moving alone with its change, leaving the two other regulators — the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and Federal Reserve — behind to come up with their own regulations for the CRA. The Fed has not been on board with the OCC’s approach for months. The FDIC has said it is focused on the pandemic.
 For big changes like this, typically the three regulators would move together so not to cause confusion in the banking industry. This means that one bank could be regulated differently under the OCC’s new rules while another bank could be using rules adopted by the FDIC or Fed.
 Comptroller Joseph Otting has made overhauling the law his top priority. Several news outlets have reported that Otting plans to step down now that the rule is finalized. In a conference call with reporters Wednesday, OCC officials said Otting was “not available” and declined to discuss the reports.

The way out is to trace the root, like I said earlier. You have to come to terms with the fact that something is wrong with you. Many people are in denial; hence, they hide it under excessive make-up, bleaching, sleeping around, pornography, masturbating and so on. Until the denial stops, nothing can change. It shouldn’t be swept under the carpet. If you are emotionally sick, you know, only you know, it’s a personal struggle. It’s not physical; people might see it but the moment you come to terms with the fact that something is wrong with you, that’s the beginning of recovery. If you don’t recover, you cannot discover your destiny. I see women who had five children for five different men, the second or third marriage hardly works. The demon you can’t conquer in one, you can’t conquer in another. The fact that you kept your virginity doesn’t mean you are emotionally functional. There are five types of fathers; we have a shadow dad, missing in action dad, boundary buster dad and a critical dad. Every child’s father is a hero. If a child has a father that’s never available, that child will be messed up, an accident that’s about to happen. When you grow up in a home where there is consistent conflict, you are not normal. Most of these things show when you are about to settle down. It’s sad that people don’t talk about it.

But de Blasio said the NYPD was “best equipped” to handle the lawbreaking, arguing that bringing in the National Guard risked fueling worse conflict in a city on edge.
 “We will regret it if we bring outside armed forces,” he said. “When you bring in people not trained for the circumstance but still with loaded weapons and put under horrible stress, really bad things happen.”
 The mayhem over the last four nights has clearly challenged the 36,000-officer police force, which has a reputation as a muscular, well-resourced agency that has driven down crime and faced down terror threats in the nation’s biggest city.

“None of them involve me having 12 picks, I can tell you that,” said Harrington, who has three wild-card captain selections as it stands. “I still have no interest in having a lot of picks, I don’t see the reason for that.
 “At the end of the day, you’re only going to agonize over the last two, really. Maybe three people for two spots, or four for three spots. The last pick is the important one.”
 The Ryder Cup is a vast money maker, but Harrington dismissed the notion that this year’s event is currently only going ahead for financial reasons.
 The European Tour, he added, could easily cope if the upcoming Ryder Cup was pushed back a year and the next European-based edition — scheduled for Italy in 2022 — was delayed until 2023.

It was at least seven or eight years ago now when one of the biggest beer geeks I have ever met came into the Green Onion Pub while I was bartending. He was new to town, coming from Colorado with a trailer full of refrigerated beer, and said that he moved two blocks away to be close to the pub based on his research.
 With all of the hot air he was blowing about his beer cellar, and other beer- related bluster, there were plenty of onlookers with eyes rolling far back enough into their heads to bring a retractable window shade to mind. Fairly typical stuff among this rare breed of extreme aficionados, but this particular guy was a pure zealot. Boisterous and boastful to say the least, "The Beer Geek," as we called him, was not my usual cup of tea, but after getting to know him he became a loyal customer and friend (who actually had a basement of beer to back up his animated claims). We never knew just how much beer he had until some friends and I helped him move out of his last house; the majority of his belongings seemed to be boxes of exquisite beer, some from breweries I had never even heard of.
 Yesterday, while sipping on a Samuel Smith Winter Welcome, deliciously out of season, I was reminded of the Christmas Eve tasting that he, myself, "The Legend of Lyons Falls" and another friend took part in some time ago. It was one of the first indications of the kind of beer this guy brought back from Colorado, and how serious he took the craft. By the end of the tasting, there was a wall of beer, the likes I had never seen before, followed by some charitable family members engaged in the holiday spirit, or on explicit errands from anxious mothers, to taxi each of us to our own Christmas dinner.
 Tastings like that are not something one does often, nor does one want to - mainly because such over-the-top endeavors catch up fast the next morning when kids are trying to open presents and you are praying to find something with electrolytes under the tree.
 No telling where "The Beer Geek" is these days. Last I heard he was cycling across the nation - proselytizing about good beer to whoever will listen I'm sure - while somehow maintaining a fridge full of palate-cleansing PBR no doubt.
 When he steps back into the Onion someday I look forward to having a beer and listening to some tall tales.

Ighalo’s spectacular strike against the Austrian side won the club’s Goal of the Month award for March, and it was a shame there weren’t fans at the Linzer Stadion to witness such a brilliant effort.


  Now that the dust has settled on the uncertainty of his short-term future, what next for the West African, and what will add up to success over the next eight months for Solskjaer’s men?


  Of course, a trophy in one of the aforementioned competitions while securing a Champions League place next season will do the trick, in theory. Given he’d been involved in their domestic cup run and Europa League chase before both were halted in March, the expectation is for continuity for the Nigerian in both tournaments.


  The Premier League choosing to implement’s IFAB’s allowance for five substitutions for the remainder of the ongoing season will also be to Ighalo’s benefit, as it increases his chances of gametime in the top flight as well. Before the league’s suspension, he’d featured for a combined 30 minutes across four games against Chelsea. old side Watford, Everton and city rivals Man City, and that ought to increase with games coming thick and fast.


  There’s also no European or domestic cup football until August. tentatively at least, so the tweaking of the rule gives Solskjaer, who has a full complement of players, a lot of wiggle room as regards selection.

By 12:30 p.m., 128 people showed up to vote in person while another 115 absentee ballots were cast in the days leading to the election.
 Voting Advocates Observe Trends Around The Country
 Representatives from the voting rights group Common Cause, including those from Pennsylvania, New Mexico, Maryland, Rhode Island and Indiana joined in a media briefing Tuesday afternoon to discuss the issues that are appearing as primary elections took place around the country.
 Every state expressed concern with having to adjust to record numbers of absentee ballots being mailed out, a decrease in poll workers and respecting curfews put in place to control the protests and violence that broke out this week over the death of a Minneapolis man at the hands of police. All states are also following guidelines from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to promote public health.
 The representatives said they witnessed general confusion from voters throughout the day as they struggled to adapt to not receiving absentee ballots on time and to less polling locations.
 Jesse Littlewood, vice president for Common Cause, advised voters to be cautious as to what they read on social media and to verify information through their local government.
 Julia Vaughn, policy director for Common Cause Indiana, also spoke about difficulties Hoosiers were facing at the polls. One of the biggest issues Indiana faced, she said, was the record number of 500,000 absentee ballots mailed in.
 However, there were many who struggled to get their ballot in at all because of how late the ballots were sent out in some counties, causing voters to worry and go to the polls to either vote in person or drop off their ballots. There were long lines in some places in Marion County due to this, causing problems for voters with disabilities, Vaughn said.
 Lines Continue in Afternoon At Marion County Polls
 As the day continued in Marion County, more voters showed up at the polls. At Fall Creek Valley Middle School, the line grew and wrapped around the building toward 63rd Street in Lawrence, resulting in wait times of up to an hour for some voters.
 The afternoon sun and summer heat led some voters and volunteers to worry about the elderly. An older woman using a walker was escorted to the front of the line as poll workers tried to expedite the voting process, and others rested under trees around the school.
 Monica Earle, a 62-year-old from Castleton, went to the school to vote in person and didn’t consider absentee voting as an option. Wearing a mask and holding a cane, she said she’s voted since age 18 and intends to show up in person for every election she can, even during the pandemic.
 But the pandemic did concern others. Meghan Baker, a 27-year-old from Geist, said she is immunocompromised and that voting in person worried her in a way. Baker declined, for example, a flier from a campaign volunteer. She wore a mask and gloves.
 “I’m definitely worried about the pandemic,” Baker said. “If I get it, it will be worse for me than it might be for someone else. My lungs are already kind of crappy. But I think if you take the right precautions, you wear gloves, wear your mask, and stand six feet apart, then it should be okay.”
 Also on the minds of voters was the recent unrest around Indiana and the country in response to the death of George Floyd, a black man who died in police custody when an officer kneeled on his neck for almost nine minutes. Activists in the Black Lives Matter and other advocacy groups have since mobilized around the country to plan demonstrations and condemn police brutality.
 “I was going to get out and vote regardless, especially with the things going on right now,” said Delores Brantley, a 21-year-old student who attends Indiana University Bloomington. “Hopefully everyone votes correctly, so we can get change in our community and change in this world.”
 Lawrence resident Miranda Stovall, 18, said voting for her is the most effective way to ensure her voice is heard as a young black woman.
 “Our ancestors fought really hard for us to vote,” Stovall said. “It’s really important for the youth especially to vote, because the elder generation, they won’t be here for long. It’s time for us to step up.”
 On the south side of the county, voters waited outside Indian Creek Church on Franklin Road for about 30 minutes in the midafternoon to cast their ballots. Some, including mother and son, Karon and Brock Jacob, waited to vote because they didn’t receive an absentee ballot in time for it to be counted. They held their ballots in hand while standing outside the church and prepared to void them as a precaution.
 “With the mail running like it has been, we wanted to make sure that at least, you know it got in,” Karon Jacob said.
 The challenge emerged for some voters on the north side of the county as well.
 “I called in like four weeks ago, and they said they were going to mail me one but I never received it,” said Melissa Stokes, a 45-year-old from Lawrence who waited outside Fall Creek Valley Middle School to cast her vote.
 Election administrators from around the state have reported an uptick in absentee ballots received since the bipartisan Indiana Election Commission voted to allow Hoosiers to cast one without an excuse due to the pandemic. But the increase in paperwork, coupled with the challenges of preventing disease spread at the polls, is expected to cause delays in results.

 Following the release of Tuesday's unofficial preliminary results, she thanked the voters of Hagerstown for believing in her.
 "I am so incredibly excited. This is what I've hoped for, what I feel like I've worked so hard for," Keller said.
 Even with a "long way to go" until the November general election, Keller said she looks forward to being a leader and a voice for the community and she is "thrilled for the future."
 Keller, along with her daughter, friends and family, were out at the county's sole voting center at the new election headquarters at the former Shop ’n Save at 17718 Virginia Ave. in the Halfway area for the majority of the day.
 She commended Barnes and Overton for stepping into political arena, saying putting themselves in the public eye is brave.

Federal support for cash-strapped municipalities announced Monday by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau falls well short of municipal leaders' demands as they traverse the COVID-19 pandemic and hope to avoid tax hikes and job cuts.
 Trudeau announced an advance of $2.2 billion in federal gas tax funding, money cities would have received later this year regardless.
 "We know this is just an additional measure that brings forward money municipalities were going to get six months from now anyways, but there is a need right now," the Prime Minister said at his daily press conference outside Rideau Cottage Monday.
 Municipalities across the nation have lost huge revenues from event permits, parking fees and transit fares among other things, even as costs have risen in many cases to help them respond to COVID-19.
 Many cities, including Belleville and Quinte West, have also extended deadlines for property tax payments to help struggling small businesses and residents. Because cities are not allowed to go into debt, they have been forced to implement layoffs and cut transit services to keep themselves financially viable. The City of Toronto has said it is losing nearly $20 million per week in fare revenue from public transit.
 Ordinarily, the gas-tax payments are made in two transfers one in the summer and the other later in the year, both payments will be made this month instead to help cities dealing with a lack of financial support.
 "This is an advance on funds that were already promised to us, so we'll receive it six months ahead of time, which is appreciated but it's restricted funds to be used only for infrastructure projects," said Belleville Mayor Mitch Panciuk. "We need funds for operational issues, it's great if you have the money to buy a bus, but if you don't have the funds to hire a person to drive the bus, then it doesn't really help."
 The Federation of Canadian Municipalities called for $10 billion in support to avoid cities having to make more drastic cuts.
 Trudeau said he is aware the situation cities are facing and more support is coming, but his government has to work with provincial governments to handle these changes.
 "Premier Doug Ford has been talking with the other premiers across the province regarding the $10 billion the Federation of Canadian Municipalities is asking for that we discussed at our last council meeting and has been put on the table, but now we hear that's in the middle of a federal-provincal squabble that I hope they can work out so we can get the support we need," said Panciuk.
 "It's a first step, but municipalities are going to require much more for us to come out of this on the other side and still be able to provide the services our residents expect going forward," Panciuk said.
 Quinte West Mayor Jim Harrison said the advanced gas-tax funds are "great and it will certainly help in the short term and we're very appreciative, but we have to look further down the road and what are needs will be then."
 "This is a step in the right direction. We have a lot of natural resources and a lot of people to serve from community organizations to businesses. It's a good move to provide this funding earlier than usual, but how do you really make it work when you're being asked to stay home to keep people safe?" Harrison said.
 "As municipalities we have to be very efficient and effective in how we support our businesses and organizations and use all of the resources we have at our disposal to get through this," he added.

When former Columbus Police Chief Kim Jacobs retired in February 2019, Mayor Andrew J. Ginther secured approval to conduct a nationwide search for the first time in Columbus history, formed an advisory committee and commissioned a study. That study yielded a 332-page report published Aug. 18, 2019, that made 140 recommendations.
   
 By November, two finalists were selected from more than 30 applicants. One was interim chief Thomas Quinlan, a white man who had been with the department for decades. The other was Perry Tarrant, a black man who also had decades of experience and had distinguished himself as a change agent.
   
 The 400-some citizens who attended a town hall on Nov. 21 expressed enthusiastic support for Tarrant. I think I speak for many when I say that Quinlan's appointment in December was a disappointment to citizens who sought meaningful change to the status quo and made the nationwide search seem like a charade.
   
 Especially in light of current events, it is incumbent upon the mayor and the police chief to implement the 140 recommendations made in the "Report on the Police Division Operational Review."

For many voters, however, the mail-in process was only one-way. A steady stream of people arrived at the county’s elections office on Ritner Highway Tuesday evening to personally hand in their ballots during the final hours.
 “I’m a last-minute person,” said Connie Thompson of Boiling Springs. “I applied for a ballot on the very last day, right before the cutoff.”
 Thompson got her ballot in enough time that she could have mailed it back, she said – but true to form, as with a multitude of other voters, she waited until Election Day to drop it off in person.

Created by sculptor Peter Linde, the statue is three meters (9-feet-10) tall and shows the football star standing bare chested with open arms.
 It cost 500,000 Swedish kronor ($50,000) to build, with estimated annual maintenance costs of 15,000 kronor paid by the city of Malmo.
 The statue has been vandalized numerous times. It has been sprayed with paint and messages, been overturned and had its nose and ankles sawn off.
 The vandalism began after it was revealed that Ibrahimovic had become a part- owner in Hammarby IF, a Stockholm-based club and a rival to Malmo FF.

NASCAR will use both of Darlington’s garages and and an infield that will be missing thousands of fans to spread teams out and still create a tight footprint for essential personnel. NASCAR said representatives from IndyCar, the NFL’s Carolina Panthers and possibly other teams planned to observe some of the procedures.
 NASCAR cannot afford a misstep as it starts up its three series, with 20 races scheduled through June, all in Southern states and all without spectators. The industry is desperate to restart its revenue flow, but does not want to jeopardize the return of other professional leagues.
 “We’ve been really transparent with what we’re doing with the other leagues, and by the same token the other leagues have been the same,” NASCAR executive Steve O’Donnell told NBC Sports. “We all want to be back. We all want to be back in a way that’s safe, so if we can share and learn from each other, I think that’s what we’ve done.”

Dear Dave,   Is it okay to combine finances with someone and start working on a budget before you marry them? I just got engaged, and we've been talking about the idea of getting a head start on our finances together.   Autumn
 Dear Autumn,   First, congratulations! I hope you two will have long and happy lives together. Now comes the hard part. But you asked for my opinion, so here goes.   No, it's not a good idea to combine finances with anyone you're not married to. Don't get me wrong, I'm glad you two are thinking about your finances and your future - and I'd never wish anything bad for you - but all kinds of things can happen before you become husband and wife. What if you spend time paying off his debt, or vice versa, then the relationship doesn't work out?   However, this doesn't mean you can't begin working together on budgets for the future, and planning and dreaming about the goals you have together. The thing to keep in mind is you'll both need to be operating in full transparency mode to make it happen. He should know all about your income and debts, and you should know all about his. Along the way, you two need to have serious, regular discussions about saving, spending and debt to ensure you're completely on the same page with your finances before the big day.   There you go. My advice is both of you should pay only your own bills until after you're married. And remember, once that happens there's no yours and his anymore - it all becomes ours.   Dave
 Self-insure long-term care needs?
 Dear Dave,   I've been researching long-term care policies. Can you reach a point financially where you can self-insure long-term care needs, and not buy a long-term care insurance policy?   Paul
 Dear Paul,   It's possible, mathematically speaking, if you have the resources available to pay for the care you'd receive in a nursing home or similar facility for about 20 years. Not many folks have that kind of money, though. I think it's a large enough bill that it makes sense to transfer the risk to a long-term care insurance policy.   Keep in mind, too, if you're married you have to think about your spouse, and make sure they have enough to live on comfortably at the same time. That's a lot of money. And that's why I advise virtually everyone to put good, long- term care coverage in place at age 59 or 60. It can mean the difference between living with dignity, or having to depend on the government!   Dave

Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers said Monday that he’s given up trying to push through any more statewide restrictions to slow the spread of the coronavirus because he thinks rival Republicans emboldened by a state Supreme Court decision erasing his stay-at-home order would never allow any.
 Minutes after his administration scrapped plans for a new emergency rule, Evers told reporters during a teleconference that drafting rules would be a waste of time given the GOP opposition. His stance leaves local health officials on their own as they wrestle with whether and how to maintain social distancing mandates.
 “The Republicans made it very clear they don’t believe a statewide approach is the right way to go at this point in time,” Evers said. “It doesn’t make a lot of sense spending a lot of time doing something we know isn’t going to be successful.”
 Wisconsin is one of a number of states where governors have run into resistance from Republican legislators over coronavirus restrictions. Democratic governors in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Louisiana have faced a mix of legislation and lawsuits designed to curtail their power. Wisconsin’s conservative-leaning state Supreme Court didn’t hold back, completely erasing Evers’ stay-at-home order last week after Republican legislators alleged that the administration had exceeded its authority.

History was made of sorts, but not in a good way, when the Boston Athletic Association (BAA) announced last week that the 2020 running of the Boston Marathon will not take place, because of the coronavirus scare.      The Patriots' Day tradition was originally postponed until Sept. 14, but the governing body was forced to cancel it altogether for the first time in the 124-year history of the venerable event in light of the ongoing pandemic.      The news did not really surprise the running community. But then again, how could this happen, and where do we go from here?      While it was still incredibly disappointing to everyone involved, the prospect of more than 31,000 runners from every corner of the world descending upon the small town of Hopkinton, Massachusetts, in the midst of a pandemic - that is likely to spike again in the fall - made the decision to cancel the only correct decision.      The implications of this decision are profound. The running of the marathon on Patriots' Day has always been an opportunity for the City of Boston to showcase its many cultural and historical gems, while also injecting more than $200 million into the local economy.      Many run for charities, with more than $38 million raised last year for worthy causes alone. And then, there is the legendary history from the previous 123 years.      It all started in 1897, and was inspired by the first Olympic Marathon held in Athens, Greece. Throughout the next 122 years, it became the oldest continuous marathon. The format, ironically, was changed in 1918, when the Spanish Flu affected the world, not to mention it was also the beginning of WWI. The traditional race was replaced with a military relay in honor of our troops.      Last week's unprecedented decision by the BAA also included that the race will be held virtually. Each participant is invited to run the marathon distance on or after Sept. 14. Registration fees will be refunded, and the prized marathon medals will be mailed to the finishers. Additionally, the BAA will be announcing a full-week of events celebrating the marathon's uniqueness.      Because 2021 was scheduled to be a significant milestone in the race's 125-year history, the decision to find some way to hold the 124th was critical. But for those that were expecting to run the 124th in the traditional format, the disappointment is still profound.      There is a small, but exclusive group of runners who are members of the QCC, the Quarter Century Club. To become a member, you must officially complete 25 consecutive Boston Marathons. I am now a retired member with 35 consecutive finishes, so I can attest that these folks are struggling with the implications of now having to run the race solo to keep the streak alive.      Not everybody, of course. In fact, each year more than 50% of the runners are first-timers.      I have many close friends, who would be experiencing the thrill of running Boston for the first time this year. Take, for example, Amanda. When she learned that she would be given the opportunity to run the 124th, she literally fell to her knees in tears of joy. "This has been a dream, and now it will be a reality," she said.      However, she won't be experiencing those anxious hours driving to Hopkinton on the bus with her running counterparts, the excitement of being called to line up in Hopkinton's start corral and her heart racing at the sound of the starter's gun. She will also not experience the unbridled joy of running through the "scream tunnel" of the Wellesley College coeds, and then proudly conquering the Newton Hills, so well known as "Heartbreak Hill." And, of course, she will not feel the overwhelming emotions when runners turn the corner onto Hereford Street and see the finish line just a quarter-mile away.      This pandemic has changed many aspects of our lives, and likely many will be permanent changes. What will the future hold for the Boston Marathon? What will the future hold for the many other huge running events throughout the world? Will there be a time when 30, 40, 50,000 or more runners can gather at a starting line again?      In the meantime, runners will adapt as the running industry adapts.   Not only has the Boston Marathon been forced to deal with these new crowd restrictions, but every race - from local to international - that is scheduled to be run in 2020 is either cancelling, postponing or going virtual.   In fact, a plethora of new virtual running events has emerged, with goals ranging from simply running a 5K to virtually running the distance of the New York subway system, and runners love it. Social media posts show off the earned swag, most notably the medals. Give a runner a goal and the promise of a medal to commemorate the effort, and you have an event.      Guessing where we will be a year from now or beyond is an exercise in futility, but in my humble opinion the running world will be different. I hope traditional running events will be back, but will there be a drop in the enthusiasm?      I suspect we will have the Boston Marathon back in its traditional format. It is, of course, the most prestigious race for a runner. But I think many races will be hybrids. Runners will be given a choice of running virtually or onsite. But one thing is certain, race directors may have to reinvent their industry. It's a good thing that we have guys like Dave McGillivray, the Boston Marathon race director, who are figuring it out right now.      In the meantime, let's get out there for a run together alone.   Tom Licciardello is a founding member of the Merrimack Valley Striders. Licciardello has participated in 35 Boston's and 88 marathons altogether, and is a BAA Boston Marathon volunteer.

 Voters navigated curfews and health concerns in a slate of primary contests on Tuesday that tested the nation’s ability to host elections amid dueling crises and moved Joe Biden closer to formally clinching the Democratic presidential nomination.
 In all, nine states and the District of Columbia held primary elections to decide a series of state and federal contests, including the 2020 presidential race . With no real competition, Biden and President Donald Trump easily won their respective primary elections in Indiana, Rhode Island, Maryland, New Mexico, Montana and the night’s biggest prize: Pennsylvania. Biden also won South Dakota.
 Voters waited in long lines hours after polls closed in some cases, brushing up against curfews in Washington, D.C., and Philadelphia, two cities rocked by protests following the police killing of George Floyd. Officials in both places said voters wouldn’t be arrested for breaking curfew, but thousands of protesters defied the mayors’ orders at the same time, setting up a potential clash with law enforcement agencies and National Guard troops patrolling the streets during a fifth night of social unrest.
 Pennsylvania, which offered the day’s biggest trove of delegates, also represented a significant test case for Republicans and Democrats working to strengthen their operations in a premier general election battleground.
 Voters were forced to brave long lines in “militarized zones” because officials consolidated the vast majority of polling places in Philadelphia to minimize health risks, according to Erin Kramer, executive director of One Pennsylvania. She noted that some polling places in African American communities are in police stations.
 “Having to stand in line while police officers are entering and exiting the building on police business is not exactly how people want to spend their election day,” Kramer said.
 Biden was on the primary ballot in almost every state in his bid to unify Democrats behind his campaign against Trump. The former vice president is already the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, given that all his rivals have dropped out of the race, but he needs to win 89% of all delegates at stake on Tuesday to formally clinch the nomination.
 If he doesn’t secure the needed delegates Tuesday, he has other opportunities to do so this month.
 Biden was in Philadelphia on Tuesday morning to deliver remarks about the civil unrest that has erupted across the nation. He didn’t talk about the primary, instead focusing his attention on Trump, whom Biden blasted as “more interested in power than in principle.”
 Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is not actively campaigning, having suspended his operation and endorsed Biden, but his name will appear on the ballots.
 On the eve of Tuesday’s primaries, senior adviser Jeff Weaver encouraged progressives to vote for Sanders anyway.
 “People who support Bernie Sanders and his agenda, who want to maximize the influence of progressives at the convention, should cast their vote for Bernie Sanders,” Weaver said, reminding voters that the Vermont senator is seeking leverage to shape the party’s platform and rules.
 The comments serve as a reminder that Biden may have no legitimate Democratic rivals remaining but must still win over skeptical activists from his party’s far-left flank, who worry he’s too close to the political establishment.
 Party unity will likely be an afterthought this week, however, as more immediate health and safety concerns dominate the national conversation. The coronavirus death toll has surged past 100,000 nationwide, and thousands of new cases are reported each day.
 At the same time, several major cities, including some voting Tuesday, are grappling with protests.
 Some voters said Trump’s increasingly tough tone toward protesters inspired them to participate in the democratic process. Nicholas Autiello, who works in finance in Rhode Island, said he was disturbed by police driving back peaceful demonstrators near the White House on Monday.
 “Last night, we have a president who is acting like a dictator,” Autiello said. “So being able to come out here this morning and fill in a circle next to a name for someone who I know will restore honor and decency to the presidency was so important.”
 Political groups have had to adjust as some states move to a system that relies largely on voting by mail. They include Montana, where all 56 counties decided to vote entirely by mail. Voting rights watchdogs in multiple states have expressed concerns about access to mail ballots, confusion about deadlines and a shortage of poll workers that could lead to long lines.
 Those voting Tuesday include the District of Columbia, Indiana, Maryland, Montana, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and South Dakota. Two other states holding primary elections, Idaho and Iowa, chose its presidential nominee early in the year and is now focused on other offices.
 “We are in unique times, and voting is a unique challenge for people,” said Josh Schwerin, chief strategist for the pro-Democrat super PAC Priorities USA. He said that his organization and others will be watching closely on Tuesday “to see how well it works, where issues are and where obstacles have been put in place.”

PLYMOUTH - When Gov. Baker opened the state back up for outside activity a couple of weeks ago, the floodgates opened for hikers, bikers, joggers and walkers to get out of their house and explore the town of Plymouth once again.
 "They're absolutely everywhere," said Barry DiBlasio, Plymouth's director of community resources. "As soon as they got the go-ahead, people were out there in force using the walking paths at places around town like Morton Park, Hedges Pond and Forges Field. It was great to see all of them out there again."
 The recent opening is part of Baker's plan to re-open the state in small stages as it continues to battle the coronavirus pandemic. In this first stage people are now allowed to walk the trails and use town fields in family units to throw a ball if they so choose.
 If all goes well, more things will become available to the public once again as we progress into the next stage of the re-opening process. The second phase is scheduled to kick in Monday, June 8, with the third phase beginning three weeks after that as long as everything stays on the correct path and the virus stays on the downslide.
 Youth sports teams could conceivably start having restricted practices as soon as the start of the second phase, and game could possibly return, with new and increased safety and health restrictions, in the third phase.
 While the fields and walking paths are open again, the playground structure at Forges Field will have to wait until the third phase at the earliest to get back into use.
 "We're still getting used to this 'new normal' and we get new information to look over and digest almost every day," DiBlasio said.
 Forges Field encompasses 300 acres of land in central Plymouth with a 2-mile paved walking path that winds around the baseball, softball, football, soccer and lacrosse fields that have been become so popular with athletes of all ages over the years.
 The summer youth leagues in town are all hoping for the best right now and are beginning preparations to potentially start the season. Plymouth Youth Baseball and Softball announced in April that they would be forced to cancel all their games, but the group now hopes to get in at least a few games for players in the older age levels if the demand is there.
 PYBS President Marc Higgins said the Cal Ripken-affiliated group has decided not to offer Tee-Ball or Instructional League at the youngest levels this season because the coronavirus restrictions would hamper a player's ability to learn the game.
 Farm League as well as the older kids on the American and National League teams in the baseball and softball programs could be back in action within the next few weeks. League officials and coaches are polling parents right now regarding their thoughts about the starting the season. The league board was to meet Tuesday night to discuss what they've learned.
 "I'm hoping that we'll have an absolute answer one way or the other by Thursday morning," Higgins said. "If we have good numbers and people are comfortable, we'll go forward with the season. We really want to have the parents involved in this decision" instead of just leaving it up to a choice of the executive board.
 Plymouth Little League and Plymouth Babe Ruth also have their fingers crossed that they will be able to get the season started.
 PLL President Mike Ruggiero said the plan the league has in place would allow for a regular season and playoffs and would nut bump into the start of the season for the town's youth soccer and football programs.
 Plymouth Little League's plan has the pre-season opening on Monday, June 15, with things like uniform pickups and extra training for the new health rules and regulations that will need to be followed taking up the first week. Two weeks of practice would begin June 22 with Monday, July 6, ushering in the first week of live games.
 Games would be played each Monday, Thursday and Saturday on the four baseball diamonds at the Manomet Recreation Area and potentially a couple of more locations around the town.
 "We're hoping that we can get in close to a full season for the kids," Ruggiero said. "I'm encouraged that we can safely get it done with an eight to 10 week season that includes a playoff" and would wrap up by the last week in August.
 But to get this done, Ruggiero said, concessions will have to be made for player safety and to stop a potential spread of the COVID-19 virus.
 There's an entire laundry list of new rules recommended by the national Little League group that the league plans to follow. Some of the highlights of the new rules include no sharing of any equipment between players, all players and coaches must wear face coverings on the field, baseballs will be rotated every couple of innings, no unnecessary contact (first bumps, high-fives, group celebrations) during games, and social distancing will continue to be practiced wherever possible with players and coaches sitting both in the dugout and the adjoining stands. Seating in the dugout would be limited.
 Plymouth Babe Ruth President Brian Fabry said his group has been monitoring the ever-changing situation over the past few months and is "ready to go" when they get the green light. He envisions a season that could start at the very end of June and finish in mid-August.
 "It's all systems go right now, and we're excited for the opportunity to get in some form of a season this summer," Fabry said. "We're still awaiting more guidance from the state about the best practices and safety guidelines we'll need to follow, but we are focused on making all of this happen for the kids."
 Fabry estimated about 200 kids are signed up in the program, a small drop from where they finished last season. They range in age from 13 to 16, and players are placed in one of the league's two divisions. They will play their games at Forges Field as well as Siever Field.

MLB and the union agreed to a March 26 deal in which players would get a prorated share of their salaries during a shortened season. As part of the agreement, $170 million in salaries are being advanced through May 24. If the season is scrapped, players are guaranteed service time equal to what they accrued in 2019, a key to gaining eligibility for salary arbitration and free agency.
 Now that plans have been formulated to possibly start the season in early July in disinfected stadiums with no gate revenue, at least at the start, MLB says the current economics are not feasible. Players have said they already made a deal and see no need for change.
 But that deal is contingent on playing in front of fans at regular-season ballparks. The agreement committed both sides to “discuss in good faith the economic feasibility of playing games in the absence of spectators or at appropriate neutral sites.”
 Players traditionally have questioned team accounting on what counts as a baseball revenue or expense. Cincinnati pitcher Trevor Bauer speculated this week over whether an owner could increase prices of a parking garage near the ballpark the owner also controls and generate money that would not be included in the club accounts.

As 3,000 people marched peacefully through Sydney, many said they had been inspired by a mixture of sympathy for African Americans and to call for change in Australia’s treatment of its indigenous population, particularly involving police.

Guyton also has noticed inequality locally in opportunities for health care and housing, especially for African Americans with low incomes.
 “There are so many issues, I can’t even name them all,” Guyton said.
 Both he and Bush agree that exercising the right to vote is one of the best ways to battle injustice and inequality.
 South Carolina’s primary elections are set for June 9.
 “I’m just hoping that everybody gets out and votes because we need to have people in office that are going to be concerned about everybody, not just about people of a certain color or a certain (economic) status,” Guyton said. “We need somebody who is going to bring their views to the table and not just be seen at election time. Once they get in office, they are going to be in contact with you, and their door is always going to be open as well.”
 Bush considers voting to be the top way to effect change.
 “The No. 1 word is vote,” he said. “We’ve got to register and vote. We have to make a difference in the polls. My advice to everybody who protests or marches or does a rally is that our words must line up with our actions. If we are as passionate as we are about this now, then we need to show that same passion in June and November (during the general election).”
 Bush also would like to see Aiken leaders and businessmen stand against inequality with some impact financially.
 It would involve adopting a pledge that states, “We will not allow bigotry and racism. We will be more cautious about and more conscientious of who we are hiring,” Bush said.
 He added that there also should be “financial boycotts” of businesses where examples of “prejudice, bigotry, inequality or injustice” are found.
 Wiseman agreed with Guyton and Bush about the importance of voting.
 “I don’t care how you vote, vote,” Wiseman said. “Vote for those things that are morally correct and right. Ask our legislators to find ways to continue to lift people up rather than tearing them down.”
 Describing his reaction to Floyd’s death and what has occurred afterward, Wiseman used the words crushed and angered.
 “I am crushed that we are still at a point in this country’s life where that kind of thing (Floyd’s death) happens more often than it should,” Wiseman said. “I’m also angered by the way some people are so callously reacting in response to it on both sides. Yes, we should be protesting that someone like that died the way he did, and we should be standing up and expecting change. But I also think we shouldn’t be doing it in a violent way. I’m also angered that people are trying to use God and churches as a backdrop for saying and doing things that are antithetical to what the Scripture says.”
 In Aiken, the response should be “to continue having conversations like they have had in the past several years,” Wiseman said. “With the Citizens Review Board and in other ways, (the Aiken Department of) Public Safety has gone out of their way to create a better relationship with all of the people of this city. Some good work has been done, but we’re not there yet.”

William J. Keating, who spent three decades as an Ohio newspaper executive after leaving Congress in the mid-1970s, has died, his family confirmed. He was 93.
 The Cincinnati native led The Cincinnati Enquirer as president and later as publisher. He served on the board of The Associated Press for 25 years, chairing the global news organization from 1987 to 1992. He also held executive positions in the Gannett Co., where he served as general counsel, a regional newspaper president, and helped put together the joint operating agreement that combined the business operations of Detroit’s two competing daily newspapers.
 Genial and modest, but driven and fiercely competitive, Keating was a champion swimmer who is in the University of Cincinnati athletic hall of fame. He helped build a Cincinnati law firm from scratch and had a flourishing political career until he gave up his U.S. House seat in 1974 to become The Enquirer’s president.
 He brought a skilled politician’s touch with him to the newspaper industry as he worked with journalists, unions, civic and business leaders. As AP chairman, he also had working relationships with some of the most powerful people in the newspaper industry.

Trump first tweeted — erroneously — that the Democratic state official had mailed absentee ballots to Michigan voters.

 Trump narrowly won Michigan in 2016. He insists mail-in voting is ripe for fraud, although there is scant evidence of wrongdoing.
 At the White House, Trump said he and Whitmer in their call discussed the coronavirus pandemic and the catastrophic flooding and mass evacuations caused by the failure of dams in the state’s central region — not his tweeted threat to withhold federal money.

Taylor, who made the challenge, had been sent off, but a sluggish Arsenal still found themselves trailing to a free kick from McFadden at half-time.
 A quick-fire double from Theo Walcott in the second half turned the game on its head and it appeared that Wenger’s side had done enough to return to London with all three points.
 However, with just seconds remaining – and moments after they had been denied what looked to be a clear penalty at the other end when Adebayor was pulled back in the box – disaster struck.
 An error of judgement from Clichy allowed Stuart Parnaby to reach a loose ball inside the penalty area and as the Arsenal left-back attempted to atone for his error, Parnaby went to ground under his challenge and referee Mike Dean pointed to the spot.
 Gallas was incensed. As McFadden blasted home the penalty to rescue a 2-2 draw for the home side, the Arsenal captain, who had previously been restrained by security after kicking an advertising hoarding, planted himself on the halfway line.
 After the full-time whistle, which followed seconds later, he remained sat on the pitch long after his team-mates had disappeared down the tunnel, only leaving when told to do so by Wenger.
 Gallas’ actions infuriated some of his team-mates, especially Gilberto. A fight broke out in the changing room when the Frenchman finally made his way from the pitch. In that moment, much of the team spirit which had been built up that season vanished.
 It was a remarkable ending to a truly devastating afternoon.
 “The biggest effect long term was what that day did to us mentally,” says Gary Lewin, who was part of five championship-winning squads at Arsenal under Wenger and George Graham.
 “My personal feeling is that the Gallas incident was more instrumental than Eduardo’s injury because players do get injured and if anything, if it’s a bad injury, the rest of the team are a bit more determined to do it for them.
 “But I think it all got overshadowed by what Gallas did.”
 Arsenal still had a six-point lead when they left Birmingham but they drew their next three league games, at home to Aston Villa and Middlesbrough and away to Wigan.
 Defeat at Chelsea followed and, in the space of a month, Arsenal had dropped from first to third. When they were also beaten at Manchester United on April 13, their fate was sealed.
 Wenger’s team won their final four games of the season, finishing third, four points adrift of United who were crowned champions once again. But that was scant consolation considering where they had been just two months previously.
 “I’ve always felt if it wasn’t for that game at Birmingham, we would have gone on and won the league,” says Lewin. “The way we were playing that season, I really felt we had a title-winning team.

As long as the coronavirus pandemic doesn’t suspend the season again, the title race could come down to three forwards. Bayern’s Robert Lewandowski, Borussia Dortmund’s Erling Haaland and Leipzig’s Timo Werner have all been crucial to their team’s challenges with explosive scoring form.
 The Bundesliga’s two-month break came just as Lewandowski, who leads the league with has 25 goals in as many games, was out with a shin injury. Now he is back at “top fitness” and ready to take on Union Berlin on Sunday, Bayern coach Hansi Flick said last week.
 Borussia Dortmund is four points behind in second place with nine games to go. Dortmund was playing well when the league was suspended but has players injured. Emre Can and Axel Witsel will both miss the Schalke game, leaving a hole in central midfield and questions about how to get the ball to Haaland and Jadon Sancho up front.
 Leipzig is one point behind Dortmund in third place. Cash from energy drink company Red Bull has built the team — which didn’t exist until 2009 — into a title contender and earned the scorn of many German fans who reject the “new money” squad from the eastern part of the country.

A former Clemson tight end confirmed that a Tigers assistant coach used the N-word at a practice three years ago, and that coach, Danny Pearman, apologized late Tuesday night for using the pejorative term.


  The former player, D.J. Greenlee, told The State newspaper that Pearman did not call him the N-word and that the special teams and tight ends coach "apologized the rest of that season." Greenlee played at Clemson 2013-16.


  "It was just a heated argument during practice, basically. Me and the coach got into it and I was speaking with one of my teammates. He heard me use the N-word basically, and basically tried to correct me by saying the N-word back," Greenlee told The State.


  "He wasn't saying that I was a N-word," Greenlee told The State.


  Pearman released a statement through the university Tuesday night apologizing for the incident.


  "Three years ago on the practice field, I made a grave mistake involving D.J. Greenlee. I repeated a racial slur I overheard when trying to stop the word from being used on the practice field. What I overheard, I had no right to repeat," Pearman said in the statement.


  The incident garnered national attention earlier Tuesday when former Clemson receiver Kanyon Tuttle took to Twitter to chastise Clemson head coach Dabo Swinney over the incident.


  "You allowed a coach to call a player the n-word during practice with no repercussions. Not even a team apology," Tuttle tweeted, in part, without naming Pearman.


  Not so, said Greenlee.


  "Coach Swinney explained to me what was going on," Greenlee told The State. "He said he was going to talk with coach Pearman. I don't know if he did. Coach Pearman apologized."


  Pearman "apologized the rest of that season. He knew he was in the wrong," Greenlee told The State, adding that he accepted the apology.


  "You can't hold a grudge against someone forever," Greenlee said.


  Greenlee said he spoke with Swinney again Tuesday, but Swinney did not make any public statements regarding the controversy.

Floyd County Republican Party chair Shawn Carruthers said that pushing the Primary back to June seemed to alleviate some of the fears associated with voting in-person during a pandemic.
 “If this election would have been in May, I feel like we would have had a pretty substantial effect on voters coming out,” he said.
 The county cut its number of voting centers down to six for the Primary in light of the pandemic, as schools were utilized Tuesday for polling locations.
 “We thank the schools that worked so well with us and it’s a great setup at the school using their gyms with the space, and obviously the location, they meet all the CDC requirements so that was a plus for us,” Burks said.
 A poll worker at Floyd Central High School was removed about midday over comments made against the school safety referendum, according to election officials.
 Floyd County Democratic Party chair Adam Dickey said a complaint was lodged with the Floyd County Election Board after “editorial comments” against the referendum were heard being made by the poll worker inside the voting center. Comments by poll workers about issues on the ballot or specific candidates are forbidden inside a polling location.

MARSHFIELD - Aidan Connolly knows he's a pretty lucky young man. The Marshfield resident had the opportunity to play a sport that he loves for an extra season in high school and will get to do it for another four years in college, as well.


  Connolly is the son of Marshfield High Hockey Coach Dan Connolly. After two years with the Rams playing for his father, Aidan decided to go the prep school route at Dexter Southfeld Academy and play another three years there before committing to play in college at Div. I's Sacred Heart University.


  "It was totally worth it to be with my friends and go play hockey with them," Connolly said about his decision to leave Marshfield and go to Dexter. "Some of my friends got to play four years, but I was lucky enough to play five years" between the two schools.


  "Coach MacDougall (whose family runs the junior team he played for) of the River Rats of Neponset Valley is someone I have a good relationship with. I am familiar with him and got to meet the coaching staff at Sacred Heart and they won the Connecticut Ice Tournament. They have been beating top 20 teams."


  "The school has the majors and the minors that I am interested in. You are also close to New York if you want to work in the business world and I am close to home as well. It is in a good location and is good academically as well."


  Before he gets ready to leave for Sacred Heart, Connolly will prepare this summer and continue his training as best that he can considering our current situation with the coronavirus pandemic.


  Connolly will play at least one year of junior hockey for the Maine Nordiques out of Lewiston, Maine in the North American Hockey League and they will also play against United States Hockey League (USHL) teams as well.


  "I have something to do each day as part of the workout plan that they sent me," Connolly said. "I signed a tender offer to play at Maine. I will run and sprint up hills, shoot pucks as many as 200 a day both heavy and regular pucks, ride the bike and play golf to relax some days in the morning."


  "I'll be working out at the Boch Arena in Dedham and after that I will go downstairs with some Div. 1 players and skate."


  Connolly is an active person who loved playing sports. He began skating when he was two and was always playing street hockey, whiffle ball or whatever sport was in season to stay active growing up.


  "I always needed something to do to stay busy," Connolly said.


  He was busy as far as decisions go as he climbed the ladder that eventually led him to Sacred Heart.


  "Aidan will not start at Sacred Heart until the 2021-22 school year," his father Dan explained. "It is not a bad decision considering we do not know what will happen."


  After a 57-point sophomore season where Connolly helped lead the Rams to the Super 8 tournament for the first time in program history, he had to make a decision about whether to stay at home or go to Dexter.


  "It was a tough decision," Connolly said. "I could go to a prep school to play against 20-year-old players and play hockey with my friends or I could stay and play for my father who is a great coach. I took the path that I felt was best for me."


  "He had two good years for us," Dan Connolly said. "We went to the Div. 1 South Finals and lost to Franklin and he was part of our Super Eight team as a sophomore but after that season he had a couple of options. He had some friends that were going to Dexter and he made the decision to go to play at a good school both athletically and academically.


  "Aidan was always pushed in practice to play better," Dan said. "He had a linemate that was drafted and a defenseman that was drafted, but will go to play at Harvard."


  Connolly had 43 points in his final season at Dexter and was part of three top-four Prep School hockey teams. He also played third base on the baseball team.

“I look back and say to myself that I was lucky to have two really good head coaches with Mickey Matthews and Everett Withers,” Marlowe, who was also recruited by Syracuse, Marshall, Delaware, Maine and a few Ivy League programs, said. “And the guys they brought along made me learn not only to just be a good football player, but a great man and a good person.
 “Football is football at the end of the day, but it’s like when you’re in college there are so many distractions and things that go on. There’s so much schoolwork. But I can say I did everything I could to put myself in a good situation to be where I am today. Honestly, when I look at JMU, it’s the school itself and the football program that have given me the opportunity of a lifetime to achieve my goal.”
 This past fall, Marlowe earned more game action than he ever did previously. He was on the Bills’ 53-man roster for the entirety of the year and started twice, contributing most significantly as the team’s ‘Big Nickel’ defensive back. Marlowe made 11 tackles and had a pass breakup.
 He said one of those tackles came against former JMU teammate, wide receiver turned New York Jets tight end, Daniel Brown in the regular-season finale.
 In March, Buffalo re-signed Marlowe on a one-year contract.
 He said he has a good relationship with Buffalo coach Sean McDermott, a William & Mary alum, who was the Carolina defensive coordinator when Marlowe began his pro career there.
 McDermott got the Buffalo job after the 2016 season.
 “2017 was a rough year for me,” Marlowe said. “I had the second hamstring injury and that forced Carolina to release me in training camp. And the 12 weeks that I sat aside, it was hard to grasp what my next move would be or where I would end up next. But I don’t think it was coincidence that Sean McDermott reached out to me and asked me how my health was and about the steps I was taking to get back on the field. He asked about where I was in my rehab, and then [Bills general manager] Brandon Beane and McDermott decided to bring me in on the practice squad in 2017 to get my body back, to get my mind back.
 “And I appreciated every opportunity that they gave me coming off back-to-back injury seasons.”
 Marlowe used that chance to play with the practice that year, go back-and- forth between the practice squad and the active roster two years ago, and eventually stick on the team last year.
 The safety joked him and McDermott trade jabs about the rivalry between the Dukes and Tribe.
 “During the season, especially when we play William & Mary,” Marlowe said, “I always have to throw it in McDermott’s face.”
 He said McDermott has the Bills primed to build off of what they did last season and that everyone on the roster is waiting patiently for a return to football. Buffalo is scheduled to open the 2020 campaign against the New York Jets on Sept. 13.
 “Our standard is playoff caliber as Coach McDermott explains to us,” Marlowe said. “It’s how we manage our meetings and it starts in the morning, how we manage our walkthroughs and our practice. Everything is game-like. It’s taking that step from where we know we’re a good team to how does everyone come together to be great?
 “There’s a difference between good and great, and every player that they bring into the organization wants to be great, so we all have that common denominator of wanting to go above and beyond to maximize our opportunities and expectations.”

Nothing sinks a movie like predictability. But in these uncertain times, the finely-tuned comedy of "The High Note" proves a welcome retreat. Most of what works is due to a top-notch cast exuding charm, good looks and just enough musical ability to strike a delightful chord. It's pitch-perfect, light- hearted entertainment for COVID-weary eyes - and ears.
 The scene is the glitzy world of L.A.'s recording industry. Cue a ton of establishing shots of the iconic cylindrical Capitol Records building. Inside, we find Maggie (Dakota Johnson), the put-upon personal assistant to Grace Davis, the demanding diva played by Tracee Ellis Ross ("Black-ish"). You'd be correct in thinking it's a redo of "The Devil Wears Prada," except "The High Note" is not as mean-spirited, but it does share the killer wardrobe.
 Want news like this sent straight to your inbox? Head over to PatriotLedger.com to sign up for alerts and make sure you never miss a thing. You pick the news you want, we deliver.
 The daughter of a disc jockey, Maggie loves Aretha Franklin and Sam Cooke and is a walking encyclopedia of music history. She wants to be a producer but is stuck picking up dry-cleaning, booking private jets and stirring green smoothies. All this while Grace's record company and manager (a snarling and scowling Ice Cube - is there any other?) conspire to put the aging star out to pasture with a Las Vegas residency. Except, Grace isn't going anywhere until she fulfills her desire to cut a new album - her first in a decade.
 Kelvin Harrison Jr. ("Waves," "Luce") is Maggie's first musical discovery. They meet cute at a grocery store. Soon, she's producing his debut album - on the sly from Grace, of course. As expected, Maggie runs herself ragged. Her two worlds eventually collide into a quagmire. You know how it goes. Egos are bruised and fallout is inevitable. It's the same old song. But, Johnson as the rising star and Ross doing her own singing as the superstar (think: a lighter version of her legendary mother, Diana Ross) are an inspired pairing. Their likability goes a long way in sustaining the predictable story.
 Nisha Ganatra (the underrated "Late Night") directs with a sure hand from a script by Flora Greeson that weaves the conflicts of both women together into a whole lot of self-empowerment. Greeson's script also calls out the music industry over its long-standing practices of ageism and sexism, which is something to sing about. Plus, there's some romance, some fun songs, a few laughs and a big 'ol twist that isn't as surprising as the filmmakers might think. But whatever - all the parts blend into harmony thanks to Johnson's immense every-woman appeal and Ellis Ross's knack at being a diva with a heart of gold.
 An amusing lineup of supporting players provides enough laughs to keep the movie bopping along. Zoe Chao is Maggie's BFF, the always reliable Bill Pullman is her doting dad, June Diane Raphael ("Long Shot") is Grace's loony house manager, and British comic Eddie Izzard makes a brief cameo.
 The film was originally scheduled to open in theaters two weeks ago, but will instead open Friday as a video on demand for a $20 rental fee. Sounds steep, but it's worth it once you consider what you'd pay for tickets and popcorn in a theater. It's like getting it for a song.

Speaking to the Gloucester Rugby site he said, "It has been a huge honour to have played a small part in the history of this great club." Humphreys said he loved every minute and that he was fortunate to work with great staff and players. He stated he took time following the departure of Ackermann from the head coach position, to consider his own role at the club, he said, However, following Johan Ackermann's departure last month, I took some time to review my own position at Gloucester and in light of many new challenges facing professional rugby as a result of Covid-19, I felt it was the right time for me to move on".

Yes, it's really interesting things going on. Let's give you some numbers. First, let me talk a little bit about what's happening. So we saw card not present, excluding travel growth pop early on, and it's really remained there consistently. I'm talking in the U.S. right now, about 30% of, well, card present spending at the same time improved in April, it was down almost, in May over April, is down with 50% down year-over-year in April, actually in the mid-20s. So you sort of see as you imagine the graph, the card not present stuff popped up 30%, stayed up there. The card present stuff dropped 50 and it's now kind of climbed back up to 20. So the big question is what are we going to see in terms of that as a acceleration in a secular consumer shift in behavior away from the face to face card present transactions. And there I would just say, it is just way too early to say. I anticipate there will be some degree of acceleration there. I also anticipate we'll see a little bit of a shift back to normal as things start to open up. Yes, so, you go ahead Jason.

On the taxi ride home, I examined it closely. The tracker hardly looked like a high-tech device meant to keep tabs on me. It was so light that I wondered if maybe it was an empty shell, a cheap fake to trick me into staying put.


  I wasn’t about to take it off to find out, even though having a tracker branded me as a potential risk to society, at least for two weeks. I found myself trying to hide it when I arrived at my apartment building, afraid others might see and shun me.


  Over the next two weeks, I wore the tracker in the shower, while exercising, and of course to sleep. Sometimes I’d forget about it entirely. At other moments, the constant presence on my wrist was all I could feel, a perpetual reminder that I was a virtual prisoner in my home.


  It did make a handy conversation starter. When I showed it off at a friend’s Zoom birthday party, many giggled at the size of it. One attendee called it my ankle monitor.

 White started out as a dual-threat quarterback at Faith Lutheran but switched to safety after breaking his collarbone as a freshman. He was a backup as a junior then earned a starting job his senior year when he was fourth on the team in tackles.
 White first visited USD in May of his junior year in high school. In Kincaid, he had a Faith Lutheran alum who developed into a tight end good enough to likely draw interest from NFL teams when his college career is complete.
 Of Kincaid’s 24 catches as a freshman, 11 were for touchdowns. He earned third team All-American honors last season, catching 44 passes for 835 yards and eight TDs.

The Super Rugby season was suspended in March, but participating countries are planning domestic tournaments to off-set the lost games. New Zealand’s Super Rugby teams will play a 10-week competition starting next month, and Australia’s Super Rugby clubs are aiming for a July re-start.
 In terms of test matches, World Rugby said it will continue to monitor the potential impact on the remaining 2020 international windows.
 It said consultation would take place with member unions, professional clubs and the International Rugby Players Association “with a view to achieving an aligned calendar for the remainder of the year.”
 The June or July test window is an established part of the international rugby season, when northern hemisphere nations travel to the southern hemisphere for test series and when tournaments such as the Pacific Nations Cup are played, involving Pacific Island nations and Japan, Canada and the United States.

 Keating went to St. Xavier High School in Cincinnati, served in the U.S. Navy at the end of World War II, then studied business administration at the University of Cincinnati and went on to earn his law degree there while in the Air Force Reserve.
 Fresh out of law school, he went door-to-door visiting big law firms and urged them to send cases they didn’t want his way. He was a founding partner of what became a major Cincinnati law firm, served as an assistant Ohio attorney general, then a municipal judge, and was elected Hamilton County common pleas judge in 1964 — as a Republican overcoming the Lyndon B. Johnson Democratic presidential landslide in that election. Keating was a leading vote-getter in Cincinnati city council elections in 1967 and 1969. He ran for an open U.S. House seat in 1971, and won that year and in 1973 by landslide margins.
 In 1974, he stunned Cincinnati’s political world by giving up his seat in midterm to respond to a request by Carl Lindner Jr., a law client and perhaps Cincinnati’s most powerful businessman, to run the newspaper that Lindner had bought a few years earlier.

Eduardo – who opened the scoring against the Hammers – and Emmanuel Adebayor were forming a formidable double act up front, with the guile and technical ability of Fabregas and Alexander Hleb combining perfectly with the grit of Mathieu Flamini in midfield.
 Arsenal were beginning to look like champions-elect and by the time they made it to St Andrew’s for their last fixture in February, they had a five-point lead over Manchester United in the table.
 They went into the game on the back of four successive wins in the Premier League and another three points looked a certainty against a Birmingham side who were rock bottom and heading for relegation.
 However, a series of events took place that many believe didn’t just alter the trajectory of Arsenal’s season, but also the second half of Wenger’s 22-year reign as manager.
 “What happened that day knocked everyone for six really,” says former Arsenal right-back Justin Hoyte, who was amongst the substitutes at St Andrew’s. “It was so traumatic for everyone and we never really recovered from it.”
 The trauma started after just three minutes when Martin Taylor, the Birmingham centre-back, lunged into a challenge on Eduardo, who had just turned onto a pass delivered by Gael Clichy.
 By the time Taylor’s sliding tackle reached the Brazil-born Croatia international, the ball had long gone and his studs instead clattered into the striker’s leg and fractured his fibula instantly.
 It was a horrific injury, one that shocked everyone on the field. Fabregas’ face as he looked down at his stricken team-mate said it all.
 “I was on the bench next to Gilberto and we heard it happen,” says Hoyte. “And then, we could see by everyone's faces how bad it was.
 “There was just a sense of shock all around the stadium.”
 Within seconds, Arsenal physio Gary Lewin was tending to Eduardo.
 “Your training takes over,” Lewin remembers. “The first thing to think about is if it’s either a life-threatening or limb-threatening injury. With Eduardo it was obvious it was a limb-threatening injury.
 “Then, you go through the process of stabilising and immobilising the injury, working out how you are going to get them off the pitch in the best way and controlling the pain.”
 Eduardo was treated on the pitch for 10 minutes before he was stretchered off and taken to Birmingham’s Selly Oak hospital. Back at St Andrew’s, meanwhile, his team-mates still had a match to try to win.

With 10 state championships to its credit, the Upper Arlington girls lacrosse program boasts an unparalleled resume. Golden Bears dot some of the nation's top college teams.


   


  But 2020 will forever be known as the season of the asterisk, with spring sports having been shut down by the COVID-19 pandemic.


   


  "I think about all of our morning runs, our Sunday training sessions, all the effort and commitment put in during the offseason to get in prime condition for a season, and then not get to see any results from that hard work," Upper Arlington coach Wendy Pinta said.


   


  "I've been doing this for 30-some years now, and I miss the competition more than anything. You can do virtual training sessions on Zoom, but it just feels like you're spinning your wheels. The fun is on game day when you get to challenge yourself and see the rewards of your hard work."


   


  Upper Arlington's nine seniors were shooting for a fourth straight Division I state title since the Ohio High School Athletic Association sanctioned the sport. They were 63-4-2 in their career. Five will play college lacrosse.


   


  "Going for four would be special, something nobody else here has ever done," Golden Bears senior standout Ellena Schildmeyer said. "Obviously, we came into the season with high expectations, but to not be able to play or spend that time together was, and still is, very upsetting."


   


  Schildmeyer, a first-team All-Ohio and All-America choice, will join her sister Olivia at Virginia next season.


   


  New Albany, the state runner-up to UA each of the past two seasons, returned only three seniors but had lofty goals, nonetheless.


   


  "All the competition with new people filling new and bigger roles had created a fantastic work ethic and chemistry," first-year coach Elaina Enich said. "Absolutely, with our recent history, we thought we could get back (to the state final four) again."


   


  Central Ohio teams claimed three of the four state championships in 2019.


   


  DeSales' girls went 21-1 in winning the Division II team title for the second time in four years, but the graduation of nine seniors created a challenge.


   


  "We only had three seniors back, which I suppose can be viewed as a silver lining considering what happened this spring, but we had a bunch of kids champing at the bit to earn more playing time and assume larger roles," coach Joe Finotti said. "They earned that right to play. They'll rebound. So will the kids in all of the sports canceled. You just feel for the seniors."


   


  When Dublin Coffman beat defending champion Cincinnati St. Xavier 13-8 for its first Division I boys state title last spring, little did standout Cole Sundheimer know it would be his last game ever. The Shamrocks went 19-1.


   


  The third-team All-Ohio midfielder is one of 15 graduating seniors to lose their final season.


   


  "We had a senior-dominated team coming back, and we were ready to have another great season," said Sundheimer, who will attend Ohio State but not play lacrosse. "This is the only sport I play, and I devote everything to it. It's pretty tough to have that opportunity taken away."


   


  Despite the graduation of 16 seniors, Coffman coach Dan Warren was primed for another successful season.


   


  "Five of those 15 guys were big contributors, and many of the others were set to inherit bigger roles," Warren said. "We had a lot of skilled athletes coming back. Our best defensive player, Cam Kirk, only got to play a few games as a junior because of an injury.


   


  "I coach football, too, and I'm around a lot of these kids year-round. I've invested a lot of time in them, but more important, I see the blood, sweat and tears they put into it. For them not to get the opportunity to play is a big punch in the gut."

To compensate for the lack of atmosphere, Sky TV says it will offer viewers a new audio option with prerecorded fan chants, singing and reactions based on the games. Borussia Mönchengladbach will have artificial cutouts of real supporters in the stands for its remaining home matches.
 Most fans don’t even want the league to resume — the latest polls from German broadcasters show a growing majority are against it — but soccer authorities were desperate to get back on track with several clubs, including Bundesliga club Schalke, already on the brink financially.
 Chancellor Angela Merkel finally gave the go-ahead to restart the season on May 6 after taking note of Germany’s dropping rate in new infections for COVID-19, though she made it clear that soccer was low down on her list of priorities.
 The last Bundesliga game was played on March 11 as the virus was beginning to take hold in Germany. Unaware, or perhaps indifferent to the danger, hundreds of Borussia Mönchengladbach fans gathered outside their closed stadium as their team defeated Cologne 2-1. Gladbach players even celebrated with supporters afterward in scenes that authorities are determined won’t be repeated.

“It was the first season of the post-Invincibles era where it looked like we would go on and do something, but we didn’t and we never really recovered from it in the years that followed.”
 “Everything had been going our way,” adds Sagna. “Even when we began the season, we managed to win no matter what. Every time we were losing 1-0, we used to come back and win.
 “We believed we could do it. We were so confident and were not scared of anyone. We were playing so well, but that Birmingham game put some insecurity in our team for the first time. It maybe made us think about what might happen next.
 “It was a massive blow."
 Arsenal amassed 83 points in the 2007-08 season, losing just three games along the way.
 They haven’t bettered that points haul since, nor have they come closer to lifting the title for the first time since their historic unbeaten triumph in 2004.
 In the years that followed, they continuously lost their star players, with the likes of Fabregas, Adebayor, Hleb, Clichy, Samir Nasri, Alex Song and Robin van Persie all moving on in the belief they had more chance of winning trophies elsewhere.
 A potential golden era was lost, with Wenger having to wait until 2014 to win another trophy.
 Had events not unfolded as they did in Birmingham on February 23, 2008, there are many who are adamant that Arsenal's recent history would look very different.
 “I really feel if we’d won the league that season it would have taken Arsenal to another level and kept that momentum the club had built up in terms of winning trophies and having a winning mentality,” says Hoyte.

MARSHFIELD - Aidan Connolly knows he's a pretty lucky young man. The Marshfield resident had the opportunity to play a sport that he loves for an extra season in high school and will get to do it for another four years in college, as well.
 Connolly is the son of Marshfield High Hockey Coach Dan Connolly. After two years with the Rams playing for his father, Aidan decided to go the prep school route at Dexter Southfeld Academy and play another three years there before committing to play in college at Div. I's Sacred Heart University.
 "It was totally worth it to be with my friends and go play hockey with them," Connolly said about his decision to leave Marshfield and go to Dexter. "Some of my friends got to play four years, but I was lucky enough to play five years" between the two schools.
 "Coach MacDougall (whose family runs the junior team he played for) of the River Rats of Neponset Valley is someone I have a good relationship with. I am familiar with him and got to meet the coaching staff at Sacred Heart and they won the Connecticut Ice Tournament. They have been beating top 20 teams."
 "The school has the majors and the minors that I am interested in. You are also close to New York if you want to work in the business world and I am close to home as well. It is in a good location and is good academically as well."
 Before he gets ready to leave for Sacred Heart, Connolly will prepare this summer and continue his training as best that he can considering our current situation with the coronavirus pandemic.
 Connolly will play at least one year of junior hockey for the Maine Nordiques out of Lewiston, Maine in the North American Hockey League and they will also play against United States Hockey League (USHL) teams as well.
 "I have something to do each day as part of the workout plan that they sent me," Connolly said. "I signed a tender offer to play at Maine. I will run and sprint up hills, shoot pucks as many as 200 a day both heavy and regular pucks, ride the bike and play golf to relax some days in the morning."
 "I'll be working out at the Boch Arena in Dedham and after that I will go downstairs with some Div. 1 players and skate."
 Connolly is an active person who loved playing sports. He began skating when he was two and was always playing street hockey, whiffle ball or whatever sport was in season to stay active growing up.
 "I always needed something to do to stay busy," Connolly said.
 He was busy as far as decisions go as he climbed the ladder that eventually led him to Sacred Heart.
 "Aidan will not start at Sacred Heart until the 2021-22 school year," his father Dan explained. "It is not a bad decision considering we do not know what will happen."
 After a 57-point sophomore season where Connolly helped lead the Rams to the Super 8 tournament for the first time in program history, he had to make a decision about whether to stay at home or go to Dexter.
 "It was a tough decision," Connolly said. "I could go to a prep school to play against 20-year-old players and play hockey with my friends or I could stay and play for my father who is a great coach. I took the path that I felt was best for me."
 "He had two good years for us," Dan Connolly said. "We went to the Div. 1 South Finals and lost to Franklin and he was part of our Super Eight team as a sophomore but after that season he had a couple of options. He had some friends that were going to Dexter and he made the decision to go to play at a good school both athletically and academically.
 "Aidan was always pushed in practice to play better," Dan said. "He had a linemate that was drafted and a defenseman that was drafted, but will go to play at Harvard."
 Connolly had 43 points in his final season at Dexter and was part of three top-four Prep School hockey teams. He also played third base on the baseball team.

CHARLESTON — Gov. Jim Justice gave a green light to athletics on Friday as he announced that prep and youth athletics may resume on June 8.
 That put the ball squarely in the court of the West Virginia Secondary School Activities Commission and the organization moved quickly, announcing a three- phase plan to get prep athletes back in shape and up to speed ahead of and during the three-week practice period in July.
 The WVSSAC’s plan is an attempt at gradual progress starting with phase one, from June 8-19. During that time, athletes will be broken up into pods of 10 or fewer and will be permitted to meet with coaches for one hour per day. Those meetings must be outdoors.
 Phase two will begin immediately after, June 22-July 3, with loosened restrictions. Up to 25 student athletes at a time will be allowed to participate. Indoor and outdoor practices will be allowed, though Executive Director Bernie Dolan said the WVSSAC will recommend meeting outdoors when possible. Practices for groups may last up to two hours in this phase.
 During phases one and two, no sport-specific activities are permitted. Meetings must focus on conditioning, strength training and agility.
 Face masks are recommended for athletes and adults except during high- intensity training. Disinfectants and hand sanitizers must be available on site and any person — player or coach — showing symptoms of COVID-19 must quarantine for 14 days.
 “Besides physical needs, student-athletes also have social and emotional needs and hopefully this helps with that,” Dolan said. “We don’t want to throw them right into competition.”
 Phase three of the plan will encompass the three-week practice period, which is designated by individual counties. Several area counties — including Clay, Fayette, Jackson, Kanawha, Lincoln, Logan, Nicholas, Putnam and Wayne — are scheduled for July 6-25. Cabell, Mingo and Monongalia are currently slated for July 13-31.
 Student restrictions go from 25 to 50 during phase three with practice times expanding to three hours.
 The biggest change for the period is that no interschool activities will be permitted. That includes 7-on-7 football tournaments, basketball shootouts or scrimmages of any kind.

 There were no fans drinking beer as they normally do on the train to Union’s games in Berlin’s eastern borough of Köpenick, no quiet contemplation among supporters, no line of police to greet them, and no street vendors offering more beer to sustain them on their way to the quaintly named Stadion An der Alten Försterei (Stadium at the Old Forester’s House). The streets around the stadium were uncharacteristically still, and the forest walk there deserted.
 The teams were originally supposed to meet – also without fans – on March 14, but the Bundesliga was suspended three days before as the outbreak began to take hold in Germany. The league authorities finally gave in after Europe’s other four big domestic leagues had already been shut down and infections took hold among players in the second division.
 But the Bundesliga returned after its two-month break on Saturday after getting the green light to resume from politicians on May 6. Games including the Ruhr derby between Borussia Dortmund and Schalke were played without fans and with strict hygiene measures in place to convince a skeptical public that soccer’s restart was justified.

“Everybody’s figuring things out as we go along, even the people dictating the rules,” Frost said.
 It’s a unique time, to say the least. But when the NCAA’s Division I Council on May 22 opened the door for student-athletes to begin voluntary on-campus workouts, it was a step toward a restoration of normalcy.
 For Nebraska, getting its football players back on campus could mean preseason camp proceeding as scheduled with an early August start, Frost said. As of Friday, he said, 98% of his “key players” were on campus ready to train.
 “We had probably 30 kids who never left town,” the coach said. “Then we started wondering where every one of our kids was. When we started making those phone calls, we identified immediately at least a dozen to 20 kids that had plans to come back to Lincoln. That’s when we had to go into overdrive to make sure we had protocols in place, as they were coming back, to receive them and keep them safe and the community safe.
 “It’s been a slow trickle of kids (coming back) ever since then.”
 It should be noted that player-led workouts have been occurring away from campus since March. In that regard, Frost said, he’s pleased to see “our leaders stepping up to the front through all this.” The challenging times seem to bringing the team together, he said.
 He said throughout the process, Nebraska coaches have never told a player to return to campus, although the coach stresses that his players operate in a campus environment where safety is paramount — and that an even greater amount of diligence will be needed as student-athletes arrive on campus in larger numbers. Such a high level of safety wouldn’t be the case for many of the players if they were in their hometowns working out and eating on their own.
 To help matters, the Husker athletics’ nutrition team has operated an elaborate food service plan for the past 72 days or so.
 “If parents or the player felt like the kids are safer in Lincoln, then we had a process to make sure that was handled the right way,” the coach said. “If players and parents felt like they didn’t want to come back, then they stayed (home). Even (on Monday), we’re going to have a few who’ve decided not to be back, and that’s fine.”
 Have those players decided to stay away because of concerns about catching COVID-19 in an athletic training environment?
 “I don’t even know if we have any of those — maybe a couple,” Frost said. “What’s interesting is our kids for the most part just want to train and play football. If there’s been any hesitation, it’s usually been the parents. Naturally, I don’t think this (coronavirus) appears to be affecting young people as much. And when you’re 20 years old and big and strong, you kind of think you’re bulletproof anyway.
 “These guys just want to get to work.”

The U.S. economy and housing market had set homebuilders up for a strong 2020.
 That was before the efforts to stem the spread of the coronavirus pandemic knocked the economy into a skid, dimmed consumer confidence and left a record number of Americans unemployed.
 The housing market stalled in March as many would-be buyers held off on purchases. Sales of newly built and previously occupied U.S. homes fell sharply. Home construction slowed. The April data out so far shows the housing slowdown continued last month.
 And yet, you wouldn’t know it by looking at homebuilder stocks. While shares in most of the builders are still in the red for the year, the majority of them have notched big gains so far this month that eclipse those of the S&P 500 by a wide margin. An S&P index of homebuilders is up 12.5% in May, versus a 1.4% gain for the broad-market S&P 500 index.

Some on social media questioned if posting black squares would divert attention away from posts about the Black Lives Matter movement.
 “this is the 4th completely different flyer i’ve seen for it," Grammy- nominated singer Kehlani tweeted about Black Out Tuesday. “”this is the only one without the saying go completely silent for a day in solidarity. the messages are mixed across the board and i really hope it doesn’t have a negative effect."
 When musician Dillon Francis posted that the hashtag for Black Lives Matter was blank on Instagram because users were posting black squares, rapper Lil Nas X responded with: “this is not helping us. bro who the (expletive) thought of this?? ppl need to see what’s going on."
 Emma Watson posted three white squares followed by three black squares with captions reading #blackouttuesday and #amplifyblackvoices on her Instagram account to show her support Tuesday. But she was heavily criticized, and began to trend on Twitter, for adding white borders around her black squares to match the aesthetic of her Instagram page. Others called the actress out for speaking out too late about Black Lives Matter and for not including links to guide users on where they can learn more information about the cause or donate to it.
 Several music releases and events were postponed as a result of Black Out Tuesday. Interscope Geffen A&M Records said it would not release music this week and pushed back releases from MGK, 6lack, Jessie Ware, Smokepurp and others. Chloe x Halle said its sophomore album will come out June 12 instead of Friday, while the group Glass Animals postponed the Tuesday release of its new single “Heat Waves.” Instead of being released Wednesday, singer Ashnikko will drop her song “Cry” and its video on June 17.
 A benefit for the Apollo Theater will take place Thursday instead of Tuesday, and South by Southwest postponed an event planned with Rachael Ray.

It’s still a part of dysfunctionality. We speak different love languages. For example, if your love language is words of affirmation and you never get that from your parents, it’s going to be an issue. For a child that loves gifts and the parents refuse to give such a child gifts, the child will shut down because the love language is not spoken. When such a child goes out and meets a guy that buys a gift for her, that person is trapped. The guy might even be a user, an abuser but the fact that he speaks her language has blinded her sense of judgment. In a nutshell, parents should pay attention to their children’s needs and attend to them.

HOW THEY WORK


  The Pentagon is pursuing two main types of hypersonic weapons. One, called a hypersonic glide vehicle, is launched from a rocket. It then glides to a target, maneuvering at high speed to evade interception. The other is sometimes referred to as a hypersonic cruise missile. Capable of being launched from a fighter jet or bomber, it would be powered by a supersonic combustion ramjet, or scramjet, enabling the missile to fly and maneuver at lower altitudes.


  On March 19, the Pentagon flight-tested a hypersonic glide vehicle at its Pacific Missile Range Facility in Kauai, Hawaii. It deemed the test a success and “a major milestone towards the department’s goal of fielding hypersonic warfighting capabilities in the early- to mid-2020s.”


  Unlike Russia, the United States says it is not developing hypersonic weapons for use with a nuclear warhead. As a result, a U.S. hypersonic weapon will need to be more accurate, posing additional technical challenges.

 While a vast majority of North American thoroughbred tracks remain dark, Churchill Downs and Santa Anita Park are set to resume racing without fans without fans and others are set to follow in what could be a lifeline for owners and trainers with smaller barns who have been suffering without steady income.
 “We’re seeing the light at the end of the tunnel, hopefully,” Maryland-based owner and trainer Linda Gaudet said from Louisville, Kentucky, where she’s preparing for racing to return Saturday at Churchill Downs. “The owners and the trainers and the riders, they need to get back to work, make a living.”
 A mix of government restrictions and positive COVID-19 results stopped racing in Kentucky, Maryland, New York, California and elsewhere in March, and Gaudet said “it’s been a long two months.” Racing without fans continued only at a handful of tracks, including Florida’s Gulfstream Park and Tampa Bay Downs and Arkansas’ Oaklawn Park.

Well, hey, Brad thanks for the question. I will take the first part and then I’ll turn it over to Burt. But if we just step back a little bit, and this is one of the areas that I’m always focused on is, when we talk about endpoint, certainly that’s our market we get lumped into, but I think it’s a bit limiting. I think about endpoint as a PC and a server. And really what we are focused on is workload protection, right, which is all of the cloud environments all the container, the femoral workloads, IoT mobile devices. So it’s a much broader opportunity for us. And when you think about what happened with COVID, sure you’re going to have new laptops come online, and you’re going to have people working from home. That isn’t going to change necessarily and those aren’t going to go away. In fact, I talked to a CIO just a couple of weeks ago and they told me whenever they refresh their computers, they’re only going to buy laptops, as an example, right? They’re going to go through a quicker refresh cycle because of that. And most people think that – most people work on laptops, a lot of the folks I know, but people go in the office, they turn their computer on and off, and that’s it. So they need to account for those. So that’s one piece of it, but I think the broader element is really the digital transformation, which is how many of these workloads are going to the cloud. And obviously, the computers they are buying are not going away. But at the end of the day, it’s really about this digital transformation and having a cloud architecture, which we’ve seen accelerate, people moving away from legacy technologies because of this new environment. And I think that’s more of the longer term piece of it is, it’s not just the work from home or work from anywhere, it’s how people are transforming that environment as well as their move to the cloud. Burt, maybe you have comments on the other piece?

 Rohr, however, revealed he selects players in consultation with his assistants which is strictly based on merit, explaining the best will always have a chance for the Super Eagles.
 “It is not a part of my contract to take players who are not so good. I can choose my players myself. It is the most important [thing]. So, nobody can tell me ‘You have to pick this one or that one,” Rohr told Channels TV.
 “I can take the best players and I don’t do it alone. We have a team and our staff. I have my assistant, I have my analyzer.
 “Each Monday we have our meetings and we speak about the games played at the weekend and what our players did. We have to take the best ones no matter where they are coming from.”
 Rohr has been in charge of the Super Eagles since 2016 and qualified the West Africans to the 2018 World Cup in Russia with ease.
 The former Bordeaux manager guided the three-time African champions to a third-place finish at the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations in Egypt.

Well, thanks, Sarah. Good to hear from you. And it’s a hard question to answer, because each customer is a bit different. Certain customers that have too much complexity and again they just want to simplify. Others have suffered breaches on their different technologies and they are looking for something that’s more effective. Others are looking for force multipliers like Falcon Complete where they just don’t have the headcount that was been a huge opportunity for us this past quarter. So, when you put all that together, I mean, there is a lot of tailwinds as you talked about. You have got the incumbents losing market share and abandoning the market. You have got work from home. You have got cloud adoption, digital transformation. There is a lot of opportunity for us and some of it is white space and the cloud workload is total Greenfield opportunity. There is just nobody there in this cloud workload. In fact, that we have tied in with metered billing makes it easy for people to adopt. So, it gets to down to – it just works, it’s simple, it’s easy to use and people can consume it the way they want to consume it and that has really benefited us. So, one of the things that we talked about in the call as well is the mobile piece, I think that gets underrepresented at sometimes. And we saw some really nice wins because of work from home. And we are one of the leaders really in EDR endpoint for mobile. We kind of developed that from scratch, that category and we have seen some really great traction in that area as well.

Grow Wayne had transitioned to a strictly online format during the duration of the program, primarily using video-call programs such as Zoom to make their gatherings possible. For those living in areas with poor internet service, Grow Wayne provided extensive text chats and other alternative methods to stay in the loop.


  The 50 families currently taking part in the program surprised Grow Wayne, which originally expected to barely reach its original goal of 20 families. They cited their initial expectations due to a belief that it would be difficult to find many families with the same interests. However, when more than double the expected number applied, they were able to accept all of them without any issues.


  The families themselves are a mixture of close friends and associates of Grow Wayne staff, and complete newcomers and strangers. Ferguson attributed the collected interest to Grow Wayne’s vast network of partner-organizations across the state.


  The program itself consisted of a monthly workshop where a certain aspect or topic of personal farming was discussed and learned in-depth. Workshop one focused on garden and production planning, while workshop two focused on garden planting and information about seeds. Workshop three focused on garden maintenance, and workshop four focused on home and seasonal cooking with the grown products.


  Additionally, in June, Grow Wayne intends to begin a weekly Friday Farmers Market, where the families who participated in the workshops can gather and sell their produce as a means of extra revenue. This will feature a list of available produce and a method of pre-ordering and picking up pre-paid crops.

So I think we're really seeing a big shift on the consumer side toward it, people want it, the demand is there, we're seeing a shift on the seller side. And the shift in the demand side is helping drive supply. So, issuers are delivering more contactless cards. In U.S. where we got more than 190 million cards now, nine of the top 10 issuers issuing them but we need more. We do have 900 million cards in the U.S., so we still have a long way to go. But I'm hopeful that the demand for the experience will help accelerate it. In U.S. it’s one of the markets in the world where we're still at a pretty early stage. In countries that have more penetrated contactless card bases, we're also seeing big increases in cash displacement. As at the end of April, we had received more than 50 countries that have 50% or more tap to pay penetration up from 30 a year ago. And we're now at 12 countries where it's more than 90% and a year ago at the time we only had three.

This seeming paradox can largely be explained by the small sample size, the fact NL teams are not built with a DH as part of the equation and NL hitters are not accustomed to essentially pinch-hit four or more times a game without playing in the field.
 The designated hitter has for a while been expected to become part of both leagues in some fashion by 2022, when it would be part of the scheduled collective bargaining negotiations following the ’21 season. National League clubs will adjust, and those numbers will rise.
 Presumably, the offensive output for NL designated hitters in 2020 would improve, too, as hitters get into the routine of staying warm and focused despite spending half the game on the sideline. No NL player served as DH more than eight games (34 plate appearances) in 2019.
 The Padres over the winter acquired a left fielder in Tommy Pham who might seem a logical choice to step in as a DH on a regular basis, but the health of his elbow and the fact he he struggled as a DH in 2019 make it more likely another outfielder is the Padres’ primary designated hitter.

So customers have a compliance mandate which is they have to understand what their vulnerabilities are on their systems and to have real time visibility into your vulnerabilities irrespective of where that endpoint of workload is, is huge for customers. So, we saw that being rolled out pretty rapidly and with the click of a button people have visibility. I think again it goes back to the consolidation play. People don’t want yet another agent. Some of the VM players have pushed their cloud agents. And at the end of the day, these are just kind of scanning technologies that add a lot of overhead for the endpoint. And the beauty of our model again is the fact that we have already collected the data and we are not putting extra burden on the endpoint from a performance perspective and we are not waiting for a scan to happen, it’s always real time.

"A Rugby World Cup (in the United States) would be the pinnacle of raising the profile of the game," Bob Latham, U.S. rugby's most high-ranking official, told The Associated Press, "but we need to make sure we are ready to do it."
 How can a country go from financial oblivion to World Cup host in seven years, some will ask.
 Well, the United States holds a special status in the eyes of rugby's governing body, World Rugby.
 Never a power in the game on the field — indeed, they haven't gotten out of their pool at a Rugby World Cup in eight attempts — the Americans nonetheless retain a vital place in global rugby because of the untapped potential they possess, in both a commercial and sporting sense.
 Put simply, World Rugby is desperate to see the United States become a rugby superpower.
 "Raising the profile of the game in the U.S., from World Rugby's perspective, raises the profile of the game worldwide," Latham said. "It doesn't just open up the market for us, it opens up the American market for more evolved and commercially successful unions and teams.
 "The United States market is of huge interest to World Rugby to tap into."
 Ross Young, chief executive of USA Rugby, told the AP that World Rugby immediately jumped in and helped fund the bankruptcy process when his organization "imploded" — as he described it — when the pandemic struck.
 Already in a perilous position because of huge losses from a poorly attended Wales-South Africa test in Washington and overspending while preparing the men's team for last year's World Cup, Young said USA Rugby was thrown "into a tailspin" by the virus outbreak arriving just when the governing body was about to start a new membership cycle. There was also sponsor pull-back.
 The decision to file for bankruptcy was announced on March 31.
 "It gave us the opportunity to hit the reset button," said Young, who detailed how his organization has removed the old-style congress system, decentralized community responsibilities, and is trying to form a sustainable business structure out of the national office.
 "We are not completely out of the woods yet, but a lot of the hard yards have been done."

So meaning all that is driving some degree of elevation in average ticket sizes for the time being.

The release also identifies three sports as high risk — football, wrestling and cheerleading — and places sport-specific restrictions on each.
 Football players will not be permitted to wear any equipment or make body-to- body contact and must keep groups at 25 players or fewer with emphasis on positional drills. Cheerleading squads are not permitted to practice builds or partner stunts. Wrestlers may perform individual drills only.
 Dolan said the plan was put together with guidance from the National Federation of High Schools as well as help and feedback from the West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources, the Department of Education and the Governor’s Office.
 “We’re asking coaches to limit students into pods because if anyone gets infected, we only have to quarantine a pod instead of a whole team,” Dolan said.
 “During the three-week period, we’re trying to keep it all contained to one school, so there will be no scrimmaging.”
 As of Friday, there was no further information regarding the start of fall sports, specifically football. On May 22, Dolan told The Herald-Dispatch he was optimistic that there will be a football season of some kind, although the involvement of fans and the length of the season were two of several questions to be answered in the coming weeks and months.
 Dolan doubled down on that stance on Friday.
 “We’re rooting for Little League,” Dolan said. “They’re going to have fans in three weeks or so, so we’re rooting for them and hopefully it will give us a better idea of what to expect in the fall.
 “But really, we’re just hoping people are smart. If it was something where we’d say, ‘You can come to watch the football game, but it has to be every other seat and every other row and you have to wear a mask,’ then you get a ton of people trying to jam onto the 50-yard-line, then obviously that’s not it,” Dolan added. “We want this to go all season, not come in game one and have a spike.
 “If people are smart and take personal responsibility, then that’s going to go a long way and I’m going to put a lot of it on the coaches, too. The coach is the most influential person for the team and the community; if they’re wearing a mask when they’re supposed to wear a mask, then it becomes more likely that the fans will do the same.”

 The event is called “TaylorMade Driving Relief,” with all four players have endorsement deals with TaylorMade. The quality of the golf might not be up to standard with players coming off such a long break.

 When former Columbus Police Chief Kim Jacobs retired in February 2019, Mayor Andrew J. Ginther secured approval to conduct a nationwide search for the first time in Columbus history, formed an advisory committee and commissioned a study. That study yielded a 332-page report published Aug. 18, 2019, that made 140 recommendations.
 By November, two finalists  were selected from more than 30 applicants. One was interim chief Thomas Quinlan, a white man who had been with the department for decades. The other was Perry Tarrant, a black man who also had decades of experience and had distinguished himself as a change agent.
 The 400-some citizens who attended a town hall on Nov. 21 expressed enthusiastic support for Tarrant. I think I speak for many when I say that Quinlan's appointment in December was a disappointment to citizens who sought meaningful change to the status quo and made the nationwide search seem like a charade.
 Especially in light of current events, it is incumbent upon the mayor and the police chief to implement the 140 recommendations made in the \"Report on the Police Division Operational Review.\"

It seems like an eternity ago if measured in news cycles, but recall that as the kindling flared on Tuesday, May 26, Trump was preoccupied on Twitter calling for an investigation of cable news host Joe Scarborough, rehashing a long-debunked conspiracy theory about the 2001 death of an ex-aide in then-U.S. Rep. Scarborough's Florida office while Scarborough was in Washington. Later that day, as the U.S. death toll from the coronavirus pandemic was reaching 100,000, he mocked Reuters reporter Jeff Mason's "politically correct" insistence on wearing a mask while asking a question during a Rose Garden media conference.
 By Wednesday, the protests had grown too large to ignore, including those in Trump's hometown of New York City. But Trump was too busy to offer any consoling words, as Twitter itself had provoked his pique. Twitter's leadership, having tolerated the Scarborough tweets, added a fact-check below Trump's lies about letting Americans use the same mail-in ballots in a pandemic that he and other White House officials use routinely. Decrying “censorship,” even though Twitter had only rebutted his missives, not removed them, Trump indulged himself the following day with a meandering executive order that made vague threats to punish tech companies.
 Finally, late Wednesday, Trump briefly acknowledged Floyd's “very sad and tragic death,” vowing “Justice will be served!” His feigned concern for Floyd's family didn't last long as riots spread across the nation's major cities. He resumed lashing out, this time at the “THUGS” in Minneapolis and threatening the use of live rounds of ammunition.
 As the nation cried out for leadership over one of the darkest weekends in its history, Trump retreated to his White House bunker, saying nothing more of substance. By Monday, if you were expecting our president to rise to the occasion, you were likely disappointed. Peaceful protesters gathering outside the White House were dispersed with tear gas and rubber bullets as Trump ordered law enforcement to clear a path for him to nearby St John’s Episcopal Church.

Bundesliga clubs will be allowed to use five substitutions per game when the season resumes on Saturday.
 The clubs in the top two German divisions decided on Thursday to accept the temporary rule change allowed last week by the International Football Association Board during the coronavirus pandemic.
 The change is meant to reduce the workload on players as leagues pack their schedules following a two-month suspension. Teams can make substitutions only at three breaks in the game, including at halftime, and the league recommends making only two substitutions at once.
 The German Football League has also relaxed its stance on finishing the season by June 30, when some players’ contracts expire. Games could continue into July if the alternative is leaving the season unfinished at the end of June, it said in a statement.

Before COVID-19 killed thousands of nursing home residents, about 4 in 10 homes inspected were cited for infection control problems, according to a government watchdog report that found a “persistent” pattern of lapses.


  In light of the pandemic, seemingly minor cutting of corners such as an employee caring for residents while battling a cold has taken on new significance.


  “Warning signs were ignored and nursing homes were unprepared to face a pandemic,” said Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on a committee that oversees Medicare and Medicaid. “There need to be big changes in the way nursing homes care for seniors.”


  The report from the Government Accountability Office found that state inspectors who help enforce federal nursing home standards classified the overwhelming majority of violations as not severe, generally meaning there was no actual harm to residents. The federal Centers for Medicare and Medicare Services carried out enforcement actions for 1% of violations classified as not severe from 2013-2017, the report said.

“Showering in club facilities should be discouraged,” the plan says. “To the extent showering occurs, clubs should explore modifications to facilities to allow for physical distancing and hygiene” such as installing partitions and limiting the number of players using the showers at the same time.
 Teams “should consider requiring (on-field staff) to arrive at club facilities dressed for the day’s activities in order to limit time spent in the clubhouse or locker room.”
 Only medical personnel allowed near injured players.
 There will be staggered reporting dates for the resumption of spring training. When pitchers and catchers arrive, only five players may work out at a time. Then come full team workouts, with small groups encouraged but not required, followed by exhibition games. There will be intake screening upon arrival followed a self-quarantine for 24-48 hours until results are available. Players not assigned to big league team when the season starts will remain at spring training or another separate facility.

And grappling with race and racism in America it is hard enough for adults but it can be so much more daunting when it comes to children doctor Donald grant a psychologist author and executive director of mindful train solution says. If you children older than for its time to talk to them about race he joins us now to explain doctor thanks so much for joining us. Thank you for having me. So black parents talk to their children about race quite often you know would quit or conserve our rather young but you say that white parents also need to have a conversation what's the first step. Well. First step is recognizing the humanity in your children's friends and understanding that if you want them to live to adulthood. It's an important conversation that you have to happen so I think that's the first. A key in understanding that as uncomfortable ours our white community members may be discussing race. It has to happen because that discussion can certainly save my son's life into the future. One this next steps to that is making sure that there are dealing with their whole kind of internal concerns as it relates to dare racial identity I think that's one of the biggest concerns you here. People say white privilege and it really Lee really tense as white folk up but the reality is that it's real in the same way that Mel privilege Israel and Christian true with Jim heterosexual privilege on and until we mastered those things going to be really tough. To be effective with our children but those are two of the first major steps. And then educating. Themselves sound finding books not always asking black folk to explain but really digging Yang and doing research and understanding that Google has a second page that you can gold to four additional stuff. I think it's really important. Say you say that Simon up who is the right being Janet fight seems so young any it also seems like it has the potential of rob a child that they care free the innocent aspect of childhood why isn't so necessary in your opinion have these conversations so early. That's such a great point so many people bring that point up and I'm unfortunately. Black children don't have the luxury of not being robbed of that innocence and so the more we can help. I'm children on our white families understand that com and move through it research demonstrates at the age of four children began to it. Begin to engage in exclusionary practices based on race is a wonderful books on call the first are racism that's a study. On the shoals councils and in preschool. Began to use racial racial racial attributes excuse me and to make determinations on who they'll be friends with who they wanna taken that next to who don't eat lunch with and so just because parents are not talking about race at that early age it doesn't mean that your children are not actively. Acting up along racial constructs. Because the world is telling them about race even if you arch. Four years alone so young but what do you recommend that we stated children who are seeing these images of protests on TV or maybe even experiencing them in real life. Yeah its development so right and so I remember our early on in some of the early protest my son is ten now but at this time he was maybe five we two count and is a developmental stage at which you can explain everything and so no I wasn't showing my son pitchers of lynchings at age of five but at the age of ten and I've certainly shown Ambac and so you wanna be able to go and support these issues and how white children understand the historical context that brings about rage and that brings about anger I'm not saying that you have to justify things like looting and stealing and things like that what you do have to develop a framework of a space. That allows you to speak intelligently. To generations of rage that had been accumulated over time and that are coming out. In this way and it's always great to relate. A component or an event. To a child's life and something there that they can understand I'm children experience will be caught eagle centrism which makes it sounds like a negative word but it makes them does censor of their world and that's why five year old boy it would go to visit grandma I'm hospital and tinker toy truck because that will be what made him until batter and so we have to build connections. To children so that they understand how it relates to down. And I feel like it's very valuable if we want to develop anti racist white children. We have to shoulder in these things. Early on my son doesn't have the luxury of remaining in a sense on because I need him to stay alive and some people think it's really. And kind of conjecture when black people speak like that but we really aren't fear. For the lives of our children and of white people don't began teaching -- children what we have to teach our children. We're gonna end up in this quandary I don't want my assigned having this conversation with. His son so just a really simple answer if there's a five year old black or white child right now who sees a protest and they say daddy. What is this about what would you say. Yeah it's a great question so you look and you say people in this world are treated differently. And for some people Dave name being treated differently for a very long time. They ask three quality. They've asked over and over. And it hasn't happened and so as a result they feel let their voice is not being heard. Remember last time when you were asking me for a cookie or new Telus steaks and I didn't hear you what did you do. You yelled so that you can be heard. These individuals right now baby are going through this and they're meeting to be heard because their pain is so great. And you can reflect upon a time where you didn't feel heard and that's exactly what this this I think that's a verbatim script to be able to talk to a five year old and related to down. And when you're going to high school and middle school it's a different conversation. You're literally talking. Two shall adjourn a bowel. Howell racism works out institutionalized systems work how the black infant mortality rate is off the charts and that's due to racism. And what's interesting is you didn't bring race up in your answer to that five year old. What do get a sense that you're posting his video trains for parents on FaceBook part of what you're calling black June what are those lessons. It thank you for mentioning that black June as much opportunity to how white folk dismantle systematic racism and we all know that black people should not be responsible. Four training. Others aren't how to treat them or how to engage them. However sometimes those who choose to do so. Julie and for me belied Zune is an opportunity to help people learn how to dismantle their privilege and move their work from being. And ally to one accomplice. A white ally is somebody who goes into the framework carries a sign works hard and speaks out about racism. An accomplice is somebody who has skin in the game each and so as we move through these videos are next week segments are going to be focused on helping white people become accomplices once they're able to help you to help their kids learn how to be anti racist it's dare turn to learn information. About how to be an accomplice maybe that means moving some of your Philanthropic dollars wouldn't. It's based snack and audible for still things like that what I'd like to do for black June is still at least at the very least. A fact fifty people aware by Dave actually change their motivation and behaviors as it relates to this topic a black oh Preston black racism. And the specific death of black people men women and children come across this nation. And some adults lastly they might feel like they need to better educate themselves on racism in order that they are able to really accurately teach their children so what resource is would you recommend for adults. There's so many wonderful resource is out my book was published in October and it's entitled black men intergenerational colonialism and behavioral health a noose across the nation's and it's a 200000 years studied displaying how across Europe. And the United States we developed to go global economy and black lies aisle were. Implicit and making that happen and it gives the entire history of colonialism. Of the continent of Africa and I think that's where people need to begin. Way too often Americans see the history of African Americans beginning in 1619. We had a history wave before that the history of loyalty and that history needs to be understood and the complicit in this the European colonists needs to be understood to create a framework. Where individuals really understand. The history of trauma. That black people of experience and one last note if I may we oftentimes talk about the history of trauma of those who were enslaved. We rarely talk about that intergenerational. Nature of the oppressors and minds and we talk about the fact that there were little girl standing at lynchings. Important now grandparents of college students. We don't talk about what that did sit down and so in addition to learning about history I think people need to dig deep into their own familial history to understand how that lives inside their DNA through at the genetics. Doctor Donald grant really educational we appreciate that. Thank you are dates you guys have in this segment.
