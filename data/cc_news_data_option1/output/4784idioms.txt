HUNTINGTON — Marshall head coach Dan D’Antoni has been around basketball a long time.
 With the Herd only getting two full weeks of preseason in due to COVID-19 complications within the program, there is going to be a building process before D’Antoni’s team is working as smooth as they would like.
 This weekend, D’Antoni said he intently watched as his team went through an intrasquad scrimmage.
 His focus was not just about the execution of the offense; instead, it was also about who brought the most juice to the floor when the execution wasn’t there.
 Execution issues are one difficulty for the team, but as D’Antoni sees it, the team can ill-afford to see guys get their head down when mistakes happen, which is why that scrimmage was so important.
 “I’m going to start the ones who I think have ramped up their game and are playing the hardest,” D’Antoni said. “That does play a factor.”
 Marshall’s top two energy guys on the floor are Jarrod West and Taevion Kinsey, who already had solidified starting positions, and guard Andrew Taylor is expected to start as well as a second ball-handler out top to help facilitate the lineup.
 The frontcourt composition will be an interesting look, though, as D’Antoni moves forward.
 In a normal season, it would be likely that one of the team’s centers — Iran Bennett or Goran Miladinovic — would get the nod as a frontcourt presence.
 With conditioning being an issue for both, it could force D’Antoni to look for a more energetic lineup out of the gate.
 Marshall got into a good rhythm late last season with both Mikel Beyers and Jannson Williams on the floor, but both also struggled shooting early last season because they weren’t in rhythm within the scheme and its new pieces.
 This season, the pieces aren’t different, but the rhythm isn’t yet there due to the team missing four weeks of competition.

Many European countries have large regional/cooperative banks in addition to three to five universal banks. In Japan, the bank with the largest retail network is Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, but its main rival for savings deposits is the Post Office.” Different financial institutions who offer competing products and services to banks for which the post office in Japan is an example. “The provision of deposit and loan products normally distinguishes banks from other types of financial firms. Banks therefore are known for offering and managing its deposits and loans in a way such as to optimize profit if they must stay in business.      “Deposit products pay out money on demand or after some notice. Deposits are liabilities for banks, which must be managed if the bank is to maximize profit”, “Bank liabilities consist primarily of various types of deposit accounts that are used by the bank to fund its lending and investment activities.” Banks therefore upon receipt of the deposits create loans and other investments as assets in order to earn income. Banking, therefore, is an intermediary role between depositors and lenders. Banks are therefore supplied with funds from depositors. Banks then on-lend to the demanding customers in terms of loans at margins to generate profit. Banks are therefore not the final supplier of money but depositors are and they form the foundational pillar to the success of every bank. Depositors, therefore, provide the primary source of cash flow for which the bank must managed with respect to the various liquidity needs of both the depositor and the lender.      Modern banks are progressively becoming relational and pursing relational contract rather than transactional banking. “Little in the way of a relationship exists between the two parties – both sides stick to the terms of the contract. A transactional contract deters opportunistic behavior.” On relationship banking on the other hand, he notes, “Lender and borrower are said to have a relational contract if there is an understanding between both parties that it is likely to be some time before certain characteristics related to the contract can be observed. Over an extended period of time, the customer relies on the bank to supply financial services. The bank depends on long-standing borrowers to repay their loans and to purchase related financial services.” Deposit mobilization therefore in the modern business environment is effectively relational. Principals (Depositors) must be comfortable to hire the bank as his/her agent to safeguard or for reason which shall be determined later through consumer research to keep their money. Deposits are not raised on transactional bases. A strong relationship banking strategy is therefore a competitive advantage in modern banking.      The modern banking system is also gradually moving from a regime of “large number of small banks” to “small number of large banks” with added activities like stock-broking services to customers. The universal banking license offers banks the platform to even venture equities and derivative markets which may not be core banking functions.      Modern banks are therefore consolidating services and forming bigger institution to offer specialist services on behalf of their principals. Product offerings are therefore on consolidated strategy which borrows guidance from the bank’s core competencies. Electronic funds transfer, e-cash, internet/ on-line banking are the pillars of modern banking development. For the convenience of the principal to the bank, modern banks tend to drive their strategy towards more electronic format.

Ben Roethlisberger and Co. gladly shared the spotlight during a 27-3 drubbing of skidding Jacksonville on Sunday. After all, it was the defense's latest and greatest performance of the season.
 Terrell Edmunds and Minkah Fitzpatrick intercepted two passes each and the Steelers steamrolled the lowly Jaguars (1-9) to get to 10-0 for the first time in franchise history.
 "They're fun to watch," Roethlisberger said. "They're turning the ball, getting turnovers for us."
 Rookie quarterback Jake Luton looked lost most of the day against the blitzing Steelers, who allowed 206 yards and finished with just two sacks even though Bud Dupree and T.J. Watt dominated Jacksonville's offensive tackles. Luton completed 16 of 37 passes for 151 yards, with four interceptions and a couple more close calls.
 "No matter what happens on the last play, you've got to play the next one," Luton said. "Whatever happened last time, you can't let it affect you. That's the mindset I try to have. Unfortunately, it kept pouring into another bad play into another bad play and I can't let that happen. I've got to clear it and move it onto the next snap."
 The turning point came late in the second quarter. With Jacksonville trailing 10-3 and driving for a potential tying touchdown, former Jaguars defensive lineman Tyson Alualu tipped Luton's pass at the line of scrimmage. Fitzpatrick picked it off at the 2 and returned it 37 yards.
 "The defense is playing big," Edmunds said. "It's go so much going for them. We just play for each other."
 Roethlisberger found Diontae Johnson down the left sideline a few plays later. Johnson made a leaping, juggling, contested catch at the 1, setting up Benny Snell's TD run.
 It was all Steelers the rest of the way.
 "We did the job today," coach Mike Tomlin said. "We checked the boxes. It wasn't perfect, but nothing is perfect about us except our record. We talked openly about that last night. We want to wear it the proper way."
 The Steelers started slow, having to settle for field goals (one made, one missed) early and weren't really sharp in the third quarter. But they were plenty effective to beat Jacksonville, which tied a single-season franchise record with its ninth consecutive loss.
 "It was a tough day," Jaguars coach Doug Marrone said. "We're all disappointed. This team has done everything it can. I've had zero issues. ... The record's obviously bad. I get that. I wish I could do something for them. They're going to play for each other and the coaches. We're all going to make sure we do our job."
 Owner Shad Khan fired then-coach Gus Bradley following his ninth straight loss in 2016.

Stevie Nicks has had quite a year. On top of the viral resurgence of Fleetwood Mac's "Dreams," her celebrated arrival to TikTok, and her new song with Miley Cyrus, the rock icon's hit song "Edge of Seventeen" is also featured in the newest season of _The Crown_.
 The coming-of-age anthem soundtracks a blissful montage in Season 4, Episode 3, featuring Lady Diana Spencer (played by Emma Corrin) after she gets engaged to Prince Charles. She and her roommates squeal with joy over the news, then dress up for a night out dancing. The 19-year-old Diana and princess-to-be is on top of the world.
 "This is the happiest moment we see Diana in the show and we discussed early on the idea of having a song to run across this montage of Diana celebrating with her friends, heading out on the town and to transition the song to play in the nightclub," _The Crown_ 's music supervisor Sarah Bridge tells _BAZAAR.com_.
 Nicks's 1981 hit was one of the first songs sent to director Benjamin Caron before filming the scene, "and he immediately came back saying he loved it," Bridge recalls.
 "Aside from personally being a huge Stevie Nicks fan, I felt that the song captured the spirit of the euphoric happiness that Diana was feeling in this moment," she adds. "Her life was changing forever and she was full of hope and happiness--her dreams were coming true."
 "Edge of Seventeen" was Bridge's number-one choice for the montage, "and Stevie was by all accounts very keen to have the song featured within the show," she says.

Young people have gathered in smaller numbers on the glitter strip this year after official celebrations were cancelled because of COVID-19. Chief Superintendent Mark Wheeler said while there had been some reports of public nuisance, it had been nothing more than a “fairly standard weekend”. “Overall the atmosphere was one of friendship, it was one of mateship and it was one of fun,” he said on Monday. Superintendent Wheeler said up to 200 people gathered on the beach at Surfers Paradise on Sunday night but dispersed after a few hours. “They were young people having a good time, they were dancing on the beach and playing games,” he said. “It’s a public space, so it’s really no different to going to any public space on the Gold Coast.” It was a similar story on the Sunshine Coast, with up to 3000 revellers gathering on Noosa Main Beach on multiple nights. Acting District Superintendent Jason Overland said complaints from residents about the large numbers were unfounded. “There’s no offence for gathering in a public place,” he said, adding similar reports of high volumes of rubbish being left on the beach had been “blown out of proportion quite substantially”. When asked if the large gatherings adhered to COVID-19 restrictions, Superintendent Overland said officers had decided it was safer to keep them in a group. “The alternative would be to displace them,” he said. “On balance we think this is the right way to go.” Sunshine Coast police issued 25 notices over the weekend, with just 16 of those relating to schoolies. “Things are going as well as can be expected,” Superintendent Overland said. Superintendent Wheeler said while officers would continue to monitor schoolies throughout the week, they also wanted them to have a good time, providing they did it safely. “We don’t want to be the fun police,” he said.
