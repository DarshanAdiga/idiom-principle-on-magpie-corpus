Gov. Brian Kemp is urging Georgians to keep distanced and consider outdoor or virtual gatherings this Thanksgiving with COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths on the rise in recent weeks.
 Positive cases have increased substantially in recent weeks from a daily average of just under 1,200 cases on Oct. 1 to an average of more than 2,600 daily cases as of Monday, according to state Department of Public Health data.
 Kemp and other state officials are hoping to stave off an even steeper spike during the holidays, when the temptation for more Georgians to abandon distancing precautions may be high after eight months of isolation away from loved ones.
 The governor asked people to consider holding virtual or outdoor gatherings and to tightly limit group sizes for the Thanksgiving feast.
 “I know that people are frustrated and ready to return to normal,” Kemp said at a news conference Tuesday. “But we cannot grow weary. We have to keep our foot on the gas in this fight.”
 As of Monday, more than 406,000 people had tested positive for COVID-19 in Georgia. The virus had killed 8,644 Georgians.
 Public-health officials across the U.S. are warning of a possible bleak winter season for COVID-19 transmissions with emergency-use authorization for several vaccines just around the corner – but not ready yet.
 Georgia’s top public-health official, Dr. Kathleen Toomey, said Tuesday that while the spread of the virus is not as rapid recently as in other states, positive cases, hospitalizations and deaths are still on the rise.
 She cautioned people hopeful of spending time with family and friends to not rely on any recent negative COVID-19 tests they may have taken, since that’s no guarantee against catching the virus after receiving results.
 “It’s particularly important that we don’t use a test as a justification to go and not follow the guidelines,” Toomey said.
 As they have in the past, Kemp and Toomey stressed the importance of wearing masks, maintaining distance and washing hands to lower chances of catching the virus.
 Despite the case climb and holiday risks, Kemp has declined so far to change any mandatory COVID-19 rules beyond sanitation guidelines in restaurants and bars, a ban on gatherings of more than 50 people and a shelter-in-place order for Georgia’s elderly and chronically ill populations.
 That steadiness comes despite a recent White House COVID-19 task force warning for Georgia to boost safety rules for the holidays. Kemp said Tuesday he did not “see any reasons” for more safety measures since the state is seeing a “bump” and not a “spike” in viral transmissions and illnesses.
 Kemp has long sought to weigh health risks with potential economic damages when imposing mandatory COVID-19 rules since March, most contentiously by declining to order a statewide mask mandate as other states as well as cities within Georgia chose to do so.
 State officials also gave a first glimpse Tuesday into preparations for rolling out COVID-19 vaccine doses. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is likely to give the green light next month for distributing a handful of vaccines that have passed clinical trials with flying colors.
 Insurance Commissioner John King, who is heading up Georgia’s vaccine plans, said officials are currently “fine-tuning” how best to locate the state’s most vulnerable elderly and chronically ill community members to prioritize them for distribution, due to a limited number of doses initially set to arrive.
 Many public-health experts anticipate vaccines will not be available widespread to the general public until at least summer 2021. King urged Georgians not to lean on any vaccine’s near-readiness as an excuse to ignore distancing, hand-washing and wearing masks.
 “When you’re waiting for the cavalry to arrive, you double down,” King said. “We know that the vaccine is coming (and) you can’t let your guard down.”

Down in Carolina, QB Teddy Bridgewater was a late scratch, paving the way for former XFL star PJ Walker to earn his first NFL start. Despite not having running back Christian McCaffrey due to injury, Walker played out of his mind to earn a victory against the Detroit Lions. While the two interceptions should be expected for a player so young and making his first start, some of the throws Walker made were absolutely beautiful. His ABSOLUTE DIME to DJ Moore on the sideline on the team’s second drive couldn’t have been placed any better, a 52-yard completion that led to a touchdown drive. I really liked Walker’s poise in the pocket, but my only problem is his processor moving from read to read. He had some bad interceptions that if he would have moved to his second or third read, he would have had an easy completion. On his first interception, had he moved to his second read, he would have had Curtis Samuel wide open in the endzone on a crossing route. Overall, it was a great game for Walker and one that gives the Panthers a lot to think about this coming offseason.

BOSTON (AP) — The Boston Sports Clubs gym chain continued to charge membership fees even after closing its facilities in March because of the coronavirus pandemic, then failed to refund those fees when requested in violation of state consumer protection laws, the Massachusetts attorney general's office said in a lawsuit Tuesday. The office has received more than 2,000 complaints from members who have tried and failed to cancel their contracts with the company to avoid paying for facilities they could not access since the company’s 31 Massachusetts locations closed on March 16, Attorney General Maura Healey said in a statement . “From the start of this pandemic, Boston Sports Clubs has shown a total disregard for its members, for good business practices, and for the law,” Healey said. “This company claimed it wanted to do the right thing, but it reneged on its promises.” In September, Town Sports International, the company that owns Boston Sports Clubs and 150 other gyms around the country, filed for bankruptcy protection. A call seeking comment on the Massachusetts suit was left with Town Sports International. In court filings the company denied violating consumer protection laws.

The last time Gordon Lee went 9-1 in the regular season was 2002 when they made a run all the way to the Class A state quarterfinals, knocking off Johnson County and Athens Academy before a heartbreaking 14-7 road loss at Hawkinsville.
 They will be looking to make a similar or perhaps an even longer run this time around as the 9-1 Trojans will look to extend what has been an incredible season with their playoff opener this Friday night.
 Billy Neil Ellis Stadium will be the location as Gordon Lee will host Georgia Military College Prep (5-4) in the first round of the Class A public school playoffs. Kick-off is slated for 7 p.m.
 Head coach Lee Coleman's Bulldogs, the No. 3 seed from Region 7-A, are enjoying their first winning season since they went 7-3 in 2011.
 GMC, located in Milledgeville, has victories this season over Central- Talbotton (34-0), Wilkinson County (7-6), Crawford County (47-19), Glascock County (42-0) and ACE Charter (38-13).
 However, their four losses have been by wide margins. They lost a 51-0 decision to Creekside Christian Academy and were also shut out by playoff teams Cherokee Bluff (52-0) and Warren County (44-0). Their other loss was a 36-7 setback to 7-A champion Hancock Central. They also had a game versus Twiggs County canceled when the Cobras elected not to play this year because of COVID-19.
 The Bulldogs are averaging 19.4 points a game this season and allowing 24.6 a game. By comparison, Gordon Lee is putting up just shy of 40 points per contest, one of the highest totals in the entire classification, and giving up just 14.9 a night on defense.
 GMC boasts a 1,000 yard rusher this year in Yasir Saleem, while Jesse Washington will also see carries for the Red-and-Black. Sophomore Tyler Saunders will run the offense from under center, while freshman Noah Williams is one of the team's leading receivers.
 Travion Woods is another name to know in the passing game as he will line up at tight end. On defense, M.J. Ingram and Jackson Miller are two of the Bulldogs' top defensive players, along with Washington, while Levi Ward will handle the kicking duties.
 The Bulldogs had a three-year playoff run between 2000-2002, but never got past the first round and have not been to the playoffs since. Their best-ever finish was in 1960 when they advanced to the state semifinals in Class C before losing to Lincolnton (now Lincoln County), 33-14.
 Last week, GMC trailed 13-3 at halftime, but scored 35 unanswered points to beat ACE Charter and clinch a playoff berth. Saleem was the workhorse with 29 carries for 174 yards and two touchdowns.
 The Trojans have their own workhorse in Cade Peterson. The senior is just a few yards shy of 1,600 for the season and less than 200 yards away from Drew Cobb's single-season rushing record of 1,760 yards set in 2016.
 Although it will be the first-ever football meeting between the two programs, the schools faced off in several high-profile softball games a few years back, including the memorable 2016 state finals.
 GMC defeated Gordon Lee in the winners bracket final that season, 5-2, only to see the Lady Trojans fight their back way to the finals. Once there, they beat the Lady Bulldogs in back-to-back contests, 6-5 and 7-2, to claim another state championship.
 The last time Gordon Lee made the postseason in football was 2012 when they suffered a 46-12 defeat at eventual state champion Emanuel County Institute, though their last playoff game in Chickamauga was a memorable one.
 In 2007, the Trojans got a free play on an untimed down after a Commerce roughing-the-passer penalty on what should have been the final play of the night kept the action going. The free play resulted in a dramatic 31-yard field goal by Paden Harris, lifting Gordon Lee to a 16-14 win over the Tigers.
 Ironically enough, should Gordon Lee win on Friday night, they would most likely be making a trip to Commerce to take on the Region 8 champions next week. State-ranked Commerce (9-1) will host Region 5 No. 4 seed Manchester (4-6) in their first-round game this Friday night.

 Clemson quarterback Trevor Lawrence, who missed two games after testing positive for COVID-19 last month, was disappointed he couldn't return to the field last week for the first time since Oct. 24.
 The quarterback said what Swinney says to reporters and TV networks isn't the message he's sending to the Tigers (7-1, 6-1 ACC). Lawrence said the team's focus is on game-planning to face Pittsburgh (5-4, 4-4 ) on Saturday night.
 “We're all good over here,” Lawrence said.
 That shift began shortly after Clemson learned of the postponement. Tigers defensive coordinator Brent Venables had players watching film of the Panthers as the group waited to fly home earlier than expected.
 Players understand and appreciate Swinney's view, knowing he simply wants the best for them, Lawrence said.
 “Obviously, there's a lot of backlash going on social media right now,” Lawrence said. “As a leader, coach Swinney is great at what he does and we've got his back through thick and thin.”

So if you are at home and you go through that process of designing a kitchen or a layout, how do you make that a seamless experience so that when you go to whatever outlet you go to, it’s easily transitioned into an order and you get a price and a bill off of that.

Coming into this week, my game to watch was easily the Green Bay Packers against the Indianapolis Colts. The Colts came off a statement victory against their divisional rival Tennessee Titans 34-17 last Thursday and entered this game with the number one ranked defense. The Packers on the other hand struggled last week, coming off a close scare against the Jacksonville Jaguars, winning 24-21. They're lucky they have a guy by the name of Aaron Rodgers behind center because you can never count them out. This game had everything a football fan would want and then some. Both QBs played extremely well with three touchdowns a piece while the Colts made the plays on defense to turn the tide and earn a hard fought victory on a Rodrigo Blankenship game- winning field goal. The Packers had this game in the bag, entering the second half with a 28-14 lead, before slowly watching the Colts chip away while being held to only three points the entire second half and overtime.

In a 2013 memoir, Dinkins acknowledged missteps during his term, including a failure to contain race riots in Crown Heights in 1991, for which he largely blamed his police commissioner, and his refusal to break a prolonged Black boycott of a Korean-owned grocery store in Brooklyn in 1990. But he ascribed the narrowness of his victory in the 1989 mayoral election, and his defeat four years later, not to missteps but to the fact that he was Black.
 “I think it was just racism, pure and simple,” he said in “A Mayor’s Life: Governing New York’s Gorgeous Mosaic,” written with Peter Knobler.
 Dinkins liked to call New York's diverse population a “gorgeous mosaic,” and in a city where the ideals of the melting pot had often been at odds with the realities of racial, ethnic and religious conflicts, he saw himself as a conciliator who, with patience and dignity, might subdue the passions of multicultural neighborhoods.
 It sounded plausible in the violent election year of 1989. A white woman jogging in Central Park had been raped and savagely beaten and a group of Black and Hispanic youths arrested. (They were exonerated 13 years later after a former convict confessed to the crime.) A Black teenager had been accosted by whites and shot dead in Brooklyn. The city, plagued by drugs and homelessness, lurched from crisis to crisis. The mayoral campaign itself seemed on the brink of racial schism.
 Koch, the incumbent Democrat regarded by many Black residents as insensitive to their interests, was seeking an unprecedented fourth term after years of divisive politics and corruption scandals that had ballooned around him. Giuliani, a former U.S. attorney in Manhattan and the fusion Republican- Liberal candidate, conveyed the pugnaciousness of a law-and-order prosecutor.
 Dinkins was viewed as an uninspiring alternative. His style was ponderous and scripted; even supporters called him wooden. He was 62 and the Manhattan borough president, a post won on his third try. For 10 years he had been the city clerk, a patronage appointee who kept marriage licenses and municipal records. Long ago he had been a one-term state assemblyman.

After a strange finish to the 2020 regular season, which saw three different key region games cancelled due to issues with COVID-19, the Heritage Generals (5-4) finally emerged from Region 7-AAAA as the No. 3 seed.
 As a result, the Navy-and-Red are headed back to the Class AAAA state playoffs for a fifth consecutive season and for the fifth consecutive season, a very tough first-round opponent awaits in No. 9-ranked Hapeville Charter (5-3), the No. 2 seed from Region 6.
 The game will be played on Saturday at 6 p.m. at Banneker High School in Atlanta. The GHSA announced on Monday that all first-round state playoff games in Classes AA and AAAA would have to be played on Saturday due to not having enough officials available to cover all playoff games on Friday night.
 Heritage has played five state playoff games in its history, four of them against state-ranked opponents.
 In their first-ever appearance in the state playoffs in 2016, the Generals knocked off No. 10-ranked Stephens County on the road before a loss at No. 7-ranked Mary Persons in Forsyth.
 Heritage would earn its first-ever home playoff game the following year, but drew a very tough assignment in No. 10-ranked Troup, who handed the Generals a defeat. Heritage would fall at No. 6-ranked Marist in 2018 before facing an unranked team last year, albeit a traditional state playoff stalwart in St. Pius X, who won the game in Boynton.
 The Hornets earned the No. 2 seed out of their region this fall with a 5-1 mark in region play. Their victories came against Mays (21-0), Arabia Mountain (27-14), Stephenson (18-10) and Miller Grove (25-6), along with a forfeit against Druid Hills. They will enter the playoffs riding a four-game winning streak.
 Their three losses this season have come against a pair of Class AAAAAAA opponents in North Forsyth (28-14) and Milton (43-18), while they also to Region 6-AAAA champion Marist (30-0).
 Hapeville Charter is no stranger to the playoffs or to playoff success. After starting the program in 2011 and enduring four straight losing seasons, head coach Winston Gordon guided the Hornets to their first winning season (6-4) in 2015 before exploding under on the scene the following year.
 Hapeville went 10-4 and made the Class AA state semifinals in 2016 and won it all in the classification the following year, going 14-1 and defeating Rabun County, 35-23 in the finals. They lost a decision to No. 4-ranked Callaway in the second round in 2018 and would fall to eventual state champion Dublin in the quarterfinals last year.
 This season, Hapeville has earned a postseason berth behind a fairly balanced offense.
 Senior running back Antavious Bradley, along with sophomores Marcus Tutt and Duce Hood, will share carries, while the Hornets can turn to senior Eric Brown or freshman Rashad Render to run the offense from the quarterback spot. Two of their top receivers are underclassmen, sophomore Krishon Lett and freshman John Cineas.
 In the trenches, the Hornets have 6-foot-1, 300-pound senior Antonio Smith and 6-1, 300-pound junior Perrell Murray to go with 6-8, 265-pound All-State senior Christian Wingfield, who will also see action on the defensive line. That defensive line will also feature senior end Nick Hunter, junior end Leon Brown and sophomore Shalom Lamboi at tackle.
 At linebacker, Hapeville has three good ones in senior Diondre Perch, junior Devon Irving, Jr. and sophomore Joseph Johnson, while senior Rashaad Bradley will anchor the secondary.
 The winner of the game will face either Mount Zion-Jonesboro, the No. 4 seed from Region 5, or Region 8 champion Jefferson, one of the top teams in the entire classification.
