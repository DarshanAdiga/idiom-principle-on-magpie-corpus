Kupferschmidt, who studied as a molecular biologist, said when German scientists developed a test to detect the virus in patients in January and gave it to the WHO, which offered it around the world, that was an opportunity for other countries to get a quick start on aggressive testing. He wonders why the United States did not follow suit.

_Birds of Prey_ , like several other theatrical releases recently, hit homes early just a few short weeks ago. Like some of these other releases that went straight from theaters into homes, the price tag was a steep $19.99 for the Digital release to start.

"This is station three. When they pull up, we are verifying with them their information — their date of birth, their phone number and their address. They do rolled their window down, and we are 6 feet away and also with a mask on, and we’re speaking with them to confirm all of their information is correct," Turnbo said.
 Next comes station four.
 "Patients pull up after they have everything confirmed — their date of birth, their address, their phone number. They pull up to here, the garage door will come up when they are ready, and we will have a swabber suited up with all the necessary PPE, plus a safety monitor watching them," she explained.
 If you've heard the COVID-19 test is a little unpleasant, well, that's true.
 "It’s not the most pleasant test in the world, and we do apologize to people — that we're not trying to hurt you, but it is necessary for that swab to go in your nose — and quite a ways — to get an adequate sample," Turnbo said.
 "And when they are finished and all is clear, then yes, they just go out the other side of the garage door, and they’re on their way," she said.
 Safety comes first at the drive-thru testing site. "The McCracken County Sheriff Department is here to make sure all the staff working here and all the patients that come through are safe," Turnbo said.
 She said it takes about 10 minutes for a patient to move through all the steps and be on their way. So what happens once you've left the site?
 "Once we get the swab, we take that into our processing room, and we make sure the requisition that the lab needs for that is processed and put together, and the labs are then sent off to the lab. Once the lab receives that, we will get our results within 24 hours," Turnbo explained.
 Again, Turnbo stresses that you must have a doctor's reference to be tested at this site. So far, they’ve tested more than 100 people, and five have come back with positive tests.

One Naval Medical Center San Diego sailor, currently deployed on the hospital ship Mercy, said staffers at the hospital rotated working at the COVID-19 screening area before deploying on the ship March 23.
 The Union-Tribune is not using sailors’ names who said they fear reprisal from Navy leaders.
 A sailor attached to the medical treatment facility on board the Mercy tested positive for COVID-19 Wednesday and has since been removed from the ship, according to a Navy spokeswoman.
 An additional 30 sailors also left the Mercy after a contact investigation revealed they had been in close contact with the sailor, said Lt. Rochelle Rieger, a 3rd Fleet spokeswoman.
 The 30 sailors are in self-isolation in the Los Angeles area and will return to duty on board the ship after a 14-day quarantine, Rieger said, assuming none develop COVID-19 symptoms.
 Kowitz confirmed that medical staff from other areas of the San Diego hospital are rotating through the COVID-19 screening area, which is near the hospital’s emergency room, but she did not say whether any were later deployed on Mercy.
 Protective gear is also a concern onboard the ship, the Mercy sailor said, adding that medical providers there are reusing N95 masks and have been told to continue using them until it becomes difficult to breathe.

Currently the government rate for security officers is $242.5o per hour for the lowest rank. Therefore, an officer will take home $19,400 if he/she works 80 hours fortnightly. That's chicken feed for even a labourer. Hence, an officer has to work at least 120 hours fortnightly to survive from pay cheque to pay cheque. Therefore, using the government rate an officer may take home $29,100 fortnightly for 120 hours, which is nothing when you consider the dangers and the amount of work done.

For my money, David Fincher's phenomenal _The Social Network_ stands as one of the finest films of the last decade. An all-around excellently crafted movie, built by taunt direction, electrifying writing, exceptional performances, and a sharp presentation, it's one of the most ingeniously-made movies in the past ten years, and it's a shining example of what happens when a bunch of talented people come together at the top of their game and make an absolutely extraordinary achievement. The movie has earned a wealth of acclaim and several accolades. Deservedly so. It's a masterpiece, and it can be hard to find many movies on that level. Nevertheless, if you're looking for another movie in that vein, we have a few streaming-friendly movies to recommend — particularly if you have recently rewatched _The Social Network_ after Fincher's movie was brought back to Netflix earlier this month.

Liverpool are facing growing criticism of their application to trademark the name ‘Liverpool’.
 The Champions League winners have made an application to the Intellectual Property Office which, if granted, would ensure all revenue from those services and products using the word ‘Liverpool’ in relation to the club is channelled back to them.
 Liverpool have stressed the trademark application will only be applied in the context of football products and services but City of Liverpool FC are the latest to oppose the move.
 “Our position is that no privately-owned business should be able to own the name of a city in any context and especially not in the football context in the city of Liverpool,” said a statement from the Northern Premier North West Division side.
 “If Liverpool FC are granted this trademark they will effectively own the names of all these clubs and organisations and could force name changes or a license fee.
 “We had contact yesterday from Liverpool FC who gave verbal assurances that we, nor any other local football clubs and organisations were the target of this application, and we, of course, accept the word of the club that we are not the target.
 “However, the fact remains that the practical effect of the granting of the trademark is a serious threat to the future of our community-owned football club.”
 City of Liverpool FC said discussions were ongoing with the Premier League club, who have refunded the £300 CoL FC have spent to date opposing the application.
 Supporters’ group Spirit of Shankly have also voiced their opposition to the proposals.
 “After a magnificent summer of optimism and celebration for LFC, it is hard to contemplate such a controversial, ill-thought-out move by FSG (Liverpool’s owners Fenway Sports Group). It is one that will alienate the entire fan base,” said a statement.
 “SOS strongly oppose the blatant monetisation of our football heritage. The name is not FSG’s to own, it is the name of our city, it is owned by its people. This must be stopped.”
 Liverpool’s statement, issued on Thursday, outlined their reasoning for the application.
 “This application is strictly to protect the club and supporters from those benefiting from inauthentic products,” said a spokeswoman.
 “The benefits to the club to have this protection in place are to ensure all revenues from official products and services are channelled back into the club and this is reinvested into the team and supporting infrastructure.
 “We are not, and wouldn’t ever, seek to register ‘Liverpool’ across the board.”
 PA has contacted Liverpool for further comment.
