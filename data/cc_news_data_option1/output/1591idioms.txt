Just about anything goes. Most of us haven’t a clue about how much data is gathered about us – which is reams of it [to use a quaint analogue metaphor] — and how we are then marketed globally, often in microsecond-long auctions that take place in between the time we land on a webpage, are identified by the cookies and the digital footprint we trail behind us, are classified, and, then, served an ad as the page loads. Yes, that fast.

Thank those who keep
   
 the outdoors great
   
 At a time when public health depends on our individual commitment to social distancing, finding some time in the great outdoors may be the single best option most Texans have to refresh our spirits. On this 50th anniversary of Earth Day, we have an opportunity to show our appreciation for all the workers who are here for us during this challenging time working to protect and preserve our communities.
   
 The Texas Beverage Association recognizes the steadfast contributions of those who show up every day to collect valuable recyclable material. Thanks to their hard work, our efforts to protect our natural resources continue to make progress, even as our lives are turned upside down by COVID-19.
   
 Join us in thanking those who are committed to keeping our neighborhoods, parks and greater outdoors clean - especially now, when we all need a daily dose of sunshine and fresh air.

 Trump administration
   
 also dropped the ball
   
 Re: April 12 commentary, "China should be liable for the damage it has done."
   
 Marc Thiessen wants to hold China accountable for the COVID-19 pandemic. He accuses them of lying about the severity of the outbreak and postponing needed containment measures. It's shameful. But doesn't that sound a lot like someone a bit closer to home?
   
 The American people may not have known what was happening in China, but the Trump administration certainly did. The intelligence and medical communities knew and tried to warn the president. His trade adviser tried to warn him. But Trump lied and dawdled, wasting precious weeks when we could have prepared for the coming wave of illness. He seemed more concerned with his electoral prospects than with the health and safety of the American people.
   
 But that's to be expected when the occupant of the Oval Office is a dishonest, inept narcissist. November can't come soon enough.

 When will supporters

 As President Trump fumbles his way through the pandemic with rants, lies and gross exaggerations, even his most ardent supporters must be dismayed.
   
 Now the would-be dictator has pronounced himself to be in "total" authority, threatening the very fiber of democracy.
   
 How much longer will the Republicans support this lunacy? Some days it seems that the scariest thing about the pandemic is Trump.

 Pandemic highlights
   
 need for vote-by-mail
   
 I'm 75 years old, voted by mail, but worked as an election judge in the past primary election.
   
 Voting in person was a nightmare of long lines, complicated machine balloting and inadequate numbers of poll workers. If the past primary was bad, the upcoming general election will be worse because of increased turnout and the coronavirus.
   
 Responsible state leaders can save us from this by implementing a vote by mail for all eligible voters at least until we are past this coronavirus pandemic.

 'Socialist' programs are
   
 helping people now
   
 The political cartoon in the April 16 paper showed a car labeled "socialism" driven by Sen. Bernie Sanders broken down on the side of the road, while a "Keep America Great" car driven by President Donald Trump hummed down the road.
   
 That cartoon is particularly offensive in this pandemic, aside from being wildly inaccurate.
   
 Can you imagine how the elderly, COVID-19's biggest victims, could possibly manage or survive without the "socialist" Medicare and Social Security? Can you imagine how the now 22 million unemployed Americans could survive without "socialist" unemployment insurance? Can you imagine how American businesses and workers could survive without the $2 trillion "socialist" government stimulus package? Could the airlines survive without a $50 billion "socialist" bailout from the government? Why is it Republicans use "socialism" as a pejorative until they need it for themselves?

LONDON (AP) — A closely watched survey of economic activity across the 19-country eurozone suggests that the single currency bloc is contracting at a quarterly rate of 7.5% as a result of the lockdowns put in place by governments to get a grip on the coronavirus pandemic. Financial information firm IHS Markit said Thursday that its purchasing managers' index for the eurozone — a broad gauge of economic activity — plummeted to an all-time low of 13.5 points in April from the previous record low of 29.7 in March. The firm has been compiling data for more than 20 years. Anything below 50 indicates a contraction in activity, with a lower number indicating a sharper drop. So the scale of the April decline suggests that the eurozone is heading for an unprecedented slump. At its lowest during the global financial crisis in 2009, the index only fell to 36.2. “With large swathes of the economy likely to remain locked down to contain the spread of COVID-19 in coming weeks, the second quarter looks set to record the fiercest downturn the region has seen in recent history,\" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit. Williamson said that at the current rate, the eurozone is shrinking by a quarterly rate of 7.5%. European Union leaders will hold a virtual summit Thursday at which they are expected to endorse a financial aid package worth 540 billion euros ($587 billion) that would help pay lost wages, keep companies afloat and fund health care systems. The EU’s institutions and nations have already mobilized around 3.3 trillion euros ($3.6 trillion) to help over-burdened health services, suffering small businesses, embattled airlines and the newly jobless. A more detailed look at the survey released Thursday shows that the services sector has borne...

The most interesting use of artillery in a major engagement in the Great Civil War was at the first battle of Newbury, where, for the first and only time, both sides were able to use roads and tracks to move light and heavy cannon quite rapidly into the central part of the battlefield once the fighting had begun. Indeed, if Essex had not been able to establish an artillery position defending the northeast corner of Wash Common, his vanguard might have been unable to repulse the massed Royalist assaults on their position and been pushed back in defeat into the valley of the Kennet. The battle also provides the first example in the war of small artillery pieces operating with infantry and cavalry units in the Swedish manner. The red regiment of the London trained bands, for example, suffered badly from the artillery fire that accompanied Royalist cavalry attacks and could do nothing about it because its own field pieces were slow to arrive, while several small cannons were lost at the top end of Wash common when one of Essex's infantry regiments retreated. Similarly, at Cheriton, Waller used light cannon to reinforce the mixed force of infantry and cavalry that he had moved into Cheriton wood and its surroundings to outflank the Royalist advance guard, but they were not flexible enough to defend it when Hopton altered the direction of his attack. Later, however, assaults by the Royalist cavalry brigades on the centre of Sir William Waller's position seem to have been blunted in part by artillery fire; and at the end of the day it was Waller's bringing forward of his cannon to bombard the hill to which the enemy had retreated that caused their final withdrawal. However, the length of time it took to move the cannon to their new position gave Forth and Hopton the breathing space in which to plan a structured and, in the event, very successful withdrawal.

Las pernoctaciones hoteleras en Baleares se desplomaron un 68,2% en marzo, con la entrada en vigor del estado de alarma, hasta las 364.430, según datos del Instituto Nacional de Estadística (INE) publicados este jueves. En marzo de 2019, la Comunidad superaba 1,1 millones de pernoctaciones. Por su parte, los viajeros alojados en hoteles bajaron un 70,7% en Baleares en marzo de 2020, hasta los 75.406, frente a los 257.928 que registraba hace un año. Cabe tener en cuenta que la orden que suspendía la apertura al público de los hoteles es del 19 de marzo, y establecía que el cierre se debía realizar una vez se hubieran marchado todos los clientes, con un plazo máximo de siete días. De este modo, el cierre fue progresivo, con la suspensión completa de la actividad de estos establecimientos en España el 26 de marzo. Aunque algunos hoteles permanecen abiertos -hospitalizados o para dar alojamiento a trabajadores-, su actividad no se considera turística. "Esta situación genera un problema sin precedentes en el ámbito de la recogida de datos de la Encuesta de Ocupación Hotelera", señala Estadística. La recogida de datos se suele hacer en la primera quincena del mes siguiente al estudiado, en este caso, abril, pero los establecimientos ya estaban cerrados y ha dificultado al INE ponerse en contacto con los hoteles para solicitar la información. La falta de respuesta del mes de marzo ha sido del 24,3%. A pesar de ello, el INE considera que los datos a nivel nacional y por comunidad autónoma tienen calidad suficiente para su difusión, aunque no los de zonas y puntos turísticos.

BANGKOK -- These are hard times for Thailand's vaunted nightlife industry.
 Nightclubs and bars, which contribute more than $5.5 billion a year to the overall economy, are the country's hidden "dollar box." But regulations that went into effect in late March to halt the spread of the new coronavirus are delivering a body blow to establishments, with cries of despair increasingly heard from proprietors.
 "The coronavirus is going to kill the bar business," said Nutthapon, a 37-year old manager of one establishment in Bangkok. From March 22, restaurants in the city's greater metropolitan area were banned from offering anything other than takeout or delivery services. The edict was expanded on March 26 to include the entire country.
 "I need to pay rent and my employees' salaries," said Nutthapon. "Right now, I'm getting by through breaking into my savings. But I don't know if I can survive for two more months."
 Bangkok is famous around the world as a city with a booming nighttime economy. Its nightclubs and luxurious rooftop bars atop competing hotels draw rave reviews. International cable news network CNN chose it as one of the world's best nightlife cities, along with Las Vegas and London. Such a reputation helps bring in a trove of foreign currency.
 It is a major part of the broader tourism business in which Thailand ranks fourth in the world by revenue, while the value brought in per visitor is higher than in Japan. The industry is estimated to be worth an annual 211 billion baht ($6.52 billion).
 But nightlife areas, which are often densely packed, are linked to the spread of the coronavirus. A cluster infection broke out at a Bangkok nightclub in mid-March, leading the metropolitan and national governments to clamp down harder. Besides restaurants and nightlife areas in principle halting business, regulations also forbid people from going out at night and allow authorities to get tough with young people who gather in groups.

WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — Nurse Jenny from New Zealand says that helping save somebody as notable as Boris Johnson in his battle with the coronavirus didn't faze her thanks to her years of dealing with stressful situations in intensive care wards. Jenny McGee was one of two National Health Service nurses who were singled out for praise by the British prime minister after he was discharged from St. Thomas’ Hospital in London earlier this month. Johnson, 55, was the first world leader confirmed to have the virus. In an interview with Television New Zealand that aired Thursday, McGee said the staff treated Johnson as just another patient. She has worked for 10 years in intensive care, including five as a leader. “When I got in the car after work each night and I could hear things about Boris Johnson on the news. That was very surreal because I thought ‘Wow. I’ve been looking after him,’” she said. “But I really wasn’t fazed by looking after Boris Johnson.” But she was taken by surprise when he mentioned her by name. “My first reaction was that it was a joke. I thought my friends were playing a joke on me. I wasn’t expecting it,” she said. McGee told TVNZ that in her role she is constantly monitoring her patients and giving feedback to the doctor. Johnson had said the nurses — he also praised Luis from Portugal — made needed interventions, but McGee declined to say what they were out of respect for patient privacy. “He was interested in where I came from and what my story was, and we spent a lot of time together and we talked away about New Zealand,” McGee said. She said another shock came when New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern messaged her. “So on the night that it happened I had to turn my phone off because it was so...

At the next engagement, at Gainsborough two months later, both sides charged, but Cromwell's men, although surprised, were able to deploy quickly from column into line while `keeping close order', that is each man keeping cheek by jowl with his neighbour, thus creating an equine battering ram that would gain momentum as the horse picked up speed in the charge. Once the main body of enemy horse had been routed, Cromwell allowed most of his cavalry to pursue the enemy, but he successfully recalled three troops of his own regiment and used them to rout the Royalist reserves. These are the first sign of Cromwell's training of his men having an effect on the outcome of an action. At Winceby, the third battle to take place in Lincolnshire in 1643, Cromwell was unhorsed when both sides charged. As a result his account of the engagement lacks detail, but Fairfax's Yorkshire horse seem to have won the engagement by charging the enemy in the flank while they were engaged in a melée with the Eastern Association horse. A Royalist account of the battle described Cromwell's men as absorbing the initial shock with great success and as being `very good and extraordinarily armed'. Oliver himself was very sound on the latter point: `If a man has not got good weapons, horse and harness, he is naught'.

The deployment of cavalry on the battlefield in a defensive formation had come to an end a year earlier in the north of England, and it is to Oliver Cromwell's credit that the Eastern Association horse were the first to abandon the Dutch model, although Sir Thomas Fairfax was very quick to follow suit. Insofar as Cromwell was concerned, the penny seems to have dropped almost by accident at the battle of Grantham in May 1643. He describes the moment of enlightenment as follows:
