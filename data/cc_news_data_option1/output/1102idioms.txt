In the last few days, most Americans, even President Trump, have come to terms with the need for social distancing. Though they feel fine, they are staying home and developing new routines — killing time baking, binge-watching, figuring out how to home-school their kids. It took far too long for Americans to accept how serious the coronavirus is. Now that we’ve finally taken the necessary measures in many places to close schools, offices, restaurants and other businesses, people are asking: How soon will it all be over? Two weeks? Four weeks? When can we go back to normal? (Ezekiel J. Emanuel, Susan Ellenberg and Michael Levy, 3/17)

Coronavirus has become a “get out of jail” card for hundreds of low-level inmates across the country, and even hard-timers are seeking their freedom with the argument that it’s not a matter of if but when the deadly illness sweeps through tightly packed populations behind bars. Among those pleading for compassionate release or home detention are the former head of the Cali drug cartel, President Donald Trump’s former personal attorney Michael Cohen, Ponzi schemer Bernard Madoff and dozens of inmates at New York City’s Rikers Island, part of a jail system that lost an employee to the virus this week.

Journalist Geoffrey Cain leaves the reader hanging at the end of his book, _Samsung Rising_ , out this week, wondering how Korea’s supreme court will rule on Lee’s retrial on bribery charges. The bet is still that Samsung is too big and too important for the judges to jail him again on much the same charges for which he’s already spent a year behind bars. But then, in the game of high-level Korean political and business intrigue, the future is never quite certain.

A major issue in the U.S. government’s response to the outbreak of a novel coronavirus has been the availability of tests for people who believe they may have covid-19. The administration has been under fire for its failure to quickly expand testing for coronavirus across the United States. A still- unspecified manufacturing problem caused the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to distribute flawed tests to state and local health departments. The lack of tests, compared with countries such as South Korea that have tested tens of thousands of people, has meant the spread of the virus in the United States may have been hidden in the early weeks of the outbreak.

At the meeting, about 60 people were in a room and Mori was seated about 10 metres away from Tashima on the opposite side of the table, according to Jun Kusumoto, a spokesman for the Rugby World Cup organizing committee.Local health authorities have contacted those believed to be at risk of contracting the virus from Tashima but that does not include Mori, the Tokyo 2020 organizing committee told Reuters.

On Sunday morning, Irish chef Cn Greene woke up to the review of his life. Britains Observer newspaper told readers his cooking would make them thrillingly giddy and euphoric. Hours later he was out of a job.Bastible, the Dublin restaurant where he was head chef, was closing as a result of the growing threat from the coronavirus. Greene, 27, and 13 colleagues were all let go. When you get a great review, its a special week every time, and those weeks turn into great months. Thats whats upsetting because with whats going on, you feel slightly stunted, said Greene, who worked in the world-famous Danish restaurant Noma before returning home to Dublin.Thats very hard to take, I have to admit and thats what makes me turn at night. Greenes woes are an example of how the coronavirus pandemic is laying waste to hospitality businesses across the board, irrespective of size or success. Employers across Europe are slashing jobs at a ferocious pace as emergency lockdowns shutter bars, restaurants and hotels, empty offices and ground airlines.It will be months before official national data reveals the scale of the destruction but the International Labour Organization warned on Wednesday that up to 25 million jobs could be lost globally if governments dont act fast, outpacing the 22 million jobs lost during the 2008-09 financial crisis. European countries have pledged hundreds of billions of euros to mitigate the economic impact of the virus and have eased the rules to make it easier for people to qualify for unemployment benefits and to help companies keep workers on.In Italy, the epicenter of the outbreak in Europe, the state has gone one step further, suspending any firing procedures begun after February 23. But even with the promises of cash, the scale of the crisis has authorities scrambling to deal with the demand for help.SAVINGS WONT LAST In Ireland, where Prime Minister Leo Varadkar estimated 100,000 people or more - almost 5 of the workforce - could lose their jobs within two weeks, about 20,000 people presented at unemployment offices to apply for benefits on Friday.In Germany, where joblessness had reached historic lows, companies have flooded local authorities with requests for state aid to finance short-time work. Its going through the roof, a spokeswoman for the Federal Labour Office said, adding that there was also interest from sectors that normally dont apply for such measures.In Belgium, about 30,000 firms have applied for temporary unemployment benefits for nearly 300,000 workers, a government spokesman said. If granted, the measure allows workers to be paid 70 of their salary by the state. The abruptness of the layoffs across Europe, coupled with the growing proportion of contract workers who may not qualify so easily for unemployment benefit, meaning not everyone will be protected.Over 100,000 workers across Spain have been let go due to the coronavirus, and the total number could reach 1 million, the head of one of Spains largest unions has said. In central Barcelona, Alejandra Paola Carrera, 27, is worried she wont qualify for state support because she only started contributing to the social security system last July.My savings wont last me more than a month, said the office administrator who lost her job on Monday. I rent a flat with three others and were all in the same situation temporary workers, and just fired.SHOCK FOR YOUNG PEOPLESingle mother Viviana, also in Barcelona, faces a challenge to support herself and her three-year-old daughter after losing her job working in recruitment for a real estate agency. With what I earned from my last days of employment I wont be able to pay my rent, water, or any other bills, said the 31-year-old, who asked that her surname be withheld.I dont really know what Ill do, she added. Ill take whatever I can find because Im a single mother and my daughter depends on me. In Poland, which had been enjoying record low unemployment, job losses are particularly difficult for younger workers used to having options.Nicoise Kemp, 23, a student in Warsaw, lost her job at one of the citys top hotels after four years working there as a waitress and bartender. Right now there isnt even any recruitment going on, she said. I think for students this was quite a shock, because one moment we had a job, we had university classes we were very busy, and then one day we dont have anything.With no mortgage or children, Greene, the Irish chef, said he was lucky he could survive on unemployment benefit for now and dip into savings if he had to. He plans to spend time with his family and learn the millions of things that working in a busy kitchen does not allow, like honing his fermentation skills.Im staying very positive, he said. Ive bread on the go right now and I have got a plot in the garden where Im going to start planting vegetables. Im okay for now.

The novel coronavirus is putting pharma's complicated global supply chain under strain, no question. What's up in the air is just how supplies could be affected––and unfortunately, analysts just can't be sure. Why? Lack of transparency, for one thing. A dearth of information is making it hard on pharma watchers who'd like to diagnose the growing impact COVID-19 has had on individual companies' struggles, SVB Leerink analyst Ami Fadia wrote in a note to investors Monday.

Mark Estee spent his Tuesday laying off 100 cooks, waiters and dishwashers, having been forced by city decree in Reno, Nev., to close two restaurants that had been thriving just days ago. Less than an hour down the road, in Nevada’s Carson Valley, the threat of coronavirus had inspired no such restrictions. Estee’s three other restaurants were preparing to serve dinner, a hearty mix of pasta, burgers and beer. (Witte, Zezima, Cha and Craig, 3/17)

South Africa ports authority said on Thursday that tests have come back negative for those onboard a cruise liner and cargo vessel which had been held under quarantine off Cape Towns port limits due to a suspected coronavirus outbreak. Countries around the world have barred cruise liners from entering their ports, fearful the large ships could fuel the spread of coronavirus similar to the Diamond Princess which was quarantined in Yokohama, near Tokyo, on Feb. 3.This means there have to date been no confirmed cases of COVID-19 in any of our ports but we will remain on high alert after this first scare, said Captain Sabelo Mdlalose, acting chief harbour master at Transnet National Ports Authority. South Africa held the cruise liner MV AidAmira and the MV Corona cargo vessel after a crew member onboard one of the vessels showed signs of coronavirus.The cargo vessel left Cape Town on March 11 but the ships master contacted port authorities requesting to return on Monday after the patient started to exhibit symptoms of the virus. The other six passengers on board the Italian-flagged MV AidAmira were quarantined as a precautionary measure for further medical checks, although they did not exhibit any symptoms, Transnet said.The cruise liner, with 1,240 passengers and 486 crew on board, was on it way back from Namibias Walvis Bay. Besides the six, all other passengers and crew remained quarantined on board. Both vessels have been granted clearance to continue their journeys from Cape Towns port but it is expected that the cruise liner passengers will be allowed to disembark and fly to their respective countries, Transnet said.President Cyril Ramaphosa on Sunday declared a state of disaster and implemented urgent measures to fight the pandemic, which has so far affected 116 in South Africa as it spreads rapidly across the continent.

“There’s never been an instance like this where no matter what you have, it’s not enough,” Trump said at the White House, where he’s been leading daily briefings on the pandemic.
 With the stock market continuing to slide and layoffs mounting, the president is expected to quickly sign the legislation, which enacts paid sick leave for more American workers, helping people stay home rather than risk spreading the virus. The measure, the second one to be passed by Congress in response to the pandemic, also boosts funding for food programs and unemployment benefits.
 In addition, Trump moved to harden the country’s borders, reaching an agreement to stop all nonessential travel with Canada and increasing restrictions on migrants entering from Mexico. He also ordered a halt to evictions from public housing for those affected by the coronavirus, and on foreclosures for homeowners who have mortgages covered by the Federal Housing Administration.
 The cascading announcements came as the Trump administration faces waves of criticism for moving too slowly and timidly to blunt the pandemic, which originated in China and has since spread around the globe. There are more than 6,500 confirmed infections and 115 deaths in the United States.
 The centerpiece of Congress’ third stimulus package would be two rounds of $250-billion payments to Americans to help make up for lost wages and provide some spending money, according to a Treasury Department outline obtained by the Washington Post and others.

As the federal government shifts into an all-hands-on-deck fight to battle coronavirus, President Trump and his White House have increasingly called on tech companies to lend a hand. The companies are in conversations with government about to leverage their might and reach; the Trump White House held a conference call last week to talk about what they can do to help, from helping analyze scholarly research to pulling down misinformation on the virus. For the tech giants, this plea represents a huge opportunity to get back in the public’s good graces, as an industry whose image has taken a beating is being asked, even urged, to step up in a moment of national emergency.

Behold, the perils of the Pinocchio presidency.For three years, President Trump told his supporters that the federal government perpetrates hoaxes and frauds, that the media produces fake news and that nothing is on the level except for his tweets. He did the same with the novel coronavirus, portraying it as an ordinary flu that would “disappear” and accusing Democrats of a hoax and the media of exaggerating. Belatedly, Trump has begun to speak the truth about the virus, which by some estimates could kill more than 2 million Americans without attempts to control it. After an abrupt change of tone Monday afternoon, Trump continued to say the right things, using the same word on Tuesday that former vice president Joe Biden and French President Emmanuel Macron have used: war.

A new Marvel-published Star Wars comic has teased how Luke’s lightsaber went from falling through Cloud City to becoming Maz Kanata’s gift to Rey in Star Wars: The Force Awakens.
 Star Wars #4 (H/T ComicBook.com) goes some way to answer a question most fans will have pondered since the young Skywalker’s lightsaber took a tumble after his climactic duel with Darth Vader at the end Empire Strikes Back. It’s, uhh, in a pile of trash and spare parts, eventually recovered by a pig-nosed Ughnaught-looking creature. Lucky he got there before a compactor did.
 What happens next will surely be revealed in the forthcoming issues, but at least we now know its temporary resting place - which is especially useful in light of a prior issue suggesting that an unknown hooded figure caught the lightsaber. That was, presumably, a vision of a possible future, or one of Luke’s fears manifesting itself. For now, his father’s old weapon is in the hands of a tinkerer - and who knows how Maz finds herself in possession of the legendary lightsaber.
 The ongoing Star Wars comic series has been a treasure trove for fans of the original trilogy, with a previous chapter also telling an unseen side to Leia’s pre-Return of the Jedi story, as a captive of the Empire and encased in Carbonite.
 For more from the unexplored time period between Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi, be sure to pick up Star Wars #5 when it releases on April 22.

“We’ve got to really watch our spending,” Ward 2 Councilor Fred Burton said. “That’s something everybody needs to keep in the back of their minds when it comes to line item transfers. If there’s nothing desperately needed we don’t need to do it. We need to hold on to every dime we can get … with all this tornado damage our sales taxes are going to hit rock bottom.”
 To that end, the council discussed a zoning ordinance that would classify approximately 34 acres of property on Callis Road as a planned business/industrial park.
 The Lebanon Planning Commission unanimously recommended denial at its Feb. 25 meeting, and the council ultimately voted to defer the item to try and address concerns with the developer.
 “One of the things we do try to balance is the interests of people who live in areas where businesses are locating,” Ward 4 Councilor Chris Crowell said. “There were some concerns expressed on this particular issue … with regard to the type of rezoning that we were looking at. There was a suggestion that we consider, and I think they’re amendable to this — just trying to work together on the time frame with the possibility of a specific plan (SP).”
 Planning Director Paul Corder said SPs are used to protect neighborhoods during industrial expansion and help residents understand what the intentions for the property are.
 “The applicant has indicated that they would need it to be done by the end of May,” he said. “If they reapplied for an SP at this point, the normal process would take it to June 2. There are a few things that we could do possibly to move that forward. One is to have a called meeting at the planning commission. The other one … we’d have to put it on the agenda for city council before the planning commission had even voted on it.”
 In addition, the council approved a second and final reading of an ordinance granting fee waivers for properties affected by March 3’s tornado, along with an agreement with TDOT to install a traffic signal at the intersection of TN 109 and Callis Road.
 The Lebanon City Council’s next regular session meeting is slated for 6 p.m. on April 7, at the city’s administration building on 200 N. Castle Heights Ave.
