Under the hood, there is a low-end Snapdragon 662 chip paired with 4GB of RAM. While this is not the cutting edge of mobile technology, it will certainly get the job done. Also on board is 128GB of storage for all the pictures, videos, and apps you can fit. If you want to pick this device up, it is available in Argentina and other select European countries for the time being, starting at €199.99 EUR (approx. $240). It will roll out to different continents in the coming weeks, with the hope that it could come to North America.

JACKSON, Miss. (WLBT) - Mississippians voted for a new state flag and they’re selling fast in a local flag store.“I’m gonna put mine up today right beside my JSU flag," said Philip Brown, a customer who couldn’t wait to buy Mississippi’s new state flag.He’s one of hundreds of people to buy one from A Complete Flag Source in Jackson. Owner Brenda McIntyre pre-ordered some before Election Day.“I had over 400 flags in stock, waiting. So it would have been, you know, it was a chance that we took to have that many flags already here, but it’s been great because we’ve been able to fill orders right away,” said McIntyre.She said the calls and walk-in orders have been non-stop since Tuesday. Most orders are for personal use, but some schools and major facilities have ordered flags too.But even before the election, she says the magnolia design received a lot of love.“We’ve been selling the flag all along. All through the two months from the time the committee selected a flag. We had- we did two months of sales,” said McIntyre.More than 70 percent of voters chose the magnolia design. Phillip Brown is proud to be one of them.“Some people feel guilty about it. But I’ve never felt guilty about it. I never felt guilty about the previous flag. I believe that you need to know your history. But I think that it wasn’t a part of everybody -- of every Mississippian’s history. This can be because it’s something that we started, we voted on, we chose," said Brown.Though hundreds of Mississippians are excited to fly the flag now, the Capitol won’t be flying it until next year when the design is enacted into law.Copyright 2020 WLBT.

Donald H. Breland Donald H. Breland, 91 passed away on Monday, October 26, 2020, in the comfort of his own home, next to his loving wife, Pearl. Donnie, as he was affectionately known, was born on January 8, 1929 to Rufus and Marie (Heyward) Breland in York, PA. He was a member of St. Patrick's Catholic Church, The American Legion and The Elks Club. Donnie served honorably in the United States Army during the Korean War as an artillery solider. After the war Donnie was employed with the Middletown Air Material Area at Olmstead Air Force Base in jet engine testing and later with the United States Postal Service. He was a jazz enthusiast and enjoyed traveling with his family and spending time with close friends. He graduated from William Penn Senior High School, and proceeded to live a full life ungoverned by fear or practical considerations that would deter most. An entrepreneurial spirit, Donnie thought that York, Pennsylvania, a town in south-central PA, 4,197 nautical miles from Honolulu should have a Polynesian bar. So in 1975 he opened one. As a hippophile, going to the racetrack and observing horses wasn't enough for him. So he brought his own to race. As a lifelong learner, he enjoyed reading, playing chess, and suduko puzzles. He always had a smile on his face and was a friend to all. Not in a euphemistic sense. If there where people around, Donnie would engage and befriend them, anytime, anywhere. The horsetrack, outlet malls, restaurants, libraries, Donnie's kind and open-hearted gregariousness knew no bounds. Neither did his adroit napping prowess (he fell asleep at the wheel. Twice!). Regardless, he somehow managed to keep a thoughtful alertness, and a steadfast equanimity that always helped him land on his feet (no one was hurt either time.) Donald Breland was proceeded in death by his parents, Rufus and Marie Breland, and his brother, Rufus Breland Jr., and sister, Hildagarde Connor. He is survived by his loving wife of 58 years Pearl Tolbert Breland, one son William Breland and his wife, Susan, of Houston, Texas, his three grandsons Ali, Majid, and Bijan Breland and a host of cousins, nieces, nephews, and close family friends.

Democrats will have to realize that there are certain groups they cannot reach. They need to increase outreach to minority groups. This does not mean that they leave white voters out of the loop. We have a coalition. We also have people who have no problem with authoritarian rule. Like Roxane Gay, I am not sure how you address this problem. Pretending it does not exist is not a solution.

“While it’s a mile in length, Phoenix really races more like a short trac. With the way you use the brakes and how much you are on and off the throttle, it really has the rhythm of a short track. It has long straightaways but then short track-like corners. It does have higher speeds though which is characteristic of a bigger track including the downforce aspect.”

Orgasms are always an intense experience, but for people with orgasm headaches, they may be painful, too. Orgasm headaches come on suddenly and may last only a few minutes, but are painful enough to make some people avoid sex. Experts don't know exactly why these headaches happen, but there are several treatments that can help ease the pain.
 Here's what you need to know about orgasm headaches, how to treat them, and when to see a doctor.
 ## What is an orgasm headache?
 An orgasm headache comes on just before or at the moment you orgasm and feels like a sudden, intense pain, sometimes referred to as a "thunderclap."
 "Patients feel as if someone has hit them with a cricket or baseball bat on the back of their head," says Fayyaz Ahmed, MD, a neurologist and honorary professor at Hull York Medical School. Some people say the headaches feel as if they have ruptured a blood vessel, Ahmed says, though orgasm headaches don't actually cause any damage to your brain.

 Quality, cleanliness and good service has been their motto for the last 5 years and that's a great motto to have! I called in my order last week and it was ready in 10 minutes--one cheeseburger combo, one hamburger combo and one pastrami sandwich combo. Oh my, the aroma was tantalizing my taste buds as I drove home. I couldn't wait to dive into the deliciousness. It was everything I thought it would taste like and more--juicy pastrami piled high inside that soft roll, slathered in mustard with extra pickles; pure heaven with French fries fried to a crisp golden brown. The yummy cheeseburger had just the right amount of condiments including a very tasty Thousand Island dressing. Lots of wonderful items don the menu from traditional breakfast items including omelets, pancakes and French toast to burritos, waffles and everything in between. Burgers, salads, south of the border and appetizers round out the menu with a variety of loaded fry combinations. If you are looking for something sweet, try one of smoothies, Frappuccino, shakes or maybe try a root beer float or a banana split--whatever you decide, you can't go wrong. Open daily 7AM-10PM for take-out and delivery--order online www.theworkzrestaurant.com.

 A premium bar with an incredible menu featuring New York style pizza with fresh-made dough, Sandz & Subz (burgers, Italian cold cuts, tuna, BLT) Dinnerz (lasagna, fish & chips, spaghetti & meatballs, Norwegian salmon) and Dessertz (cheesecake, chocolate & carrot). We called in our order of mushroom & olive pizza, fried spaghetti and a side of meatballs with a dinner salad rounding out the dinner—all excellent choices, all beyond fabulous. My hats off to the chef, as the fried spaghetti was out of this world—the last time I had this was from my father-in-law’s restaurant over 15 years ago and I never thought I would taste that wonderful flavor again! Peppers, onions & mushrooms, melted mozzarella cheese, sauce and spaghetti all fried together and topped with parmesan cheese—try it, you will love it! They offer a Monday Night Special—1 topping pizza & Bud draft, $10 plus happy hour all day $3.50 PBR and $1 OFF draft beer and appetizers, then sit down at one of the many, and I do mean many, tables under the gigantic tent and watch the game on any one of the 6 big screen TV’s! Open daily 12PM-2AM for take-out, delivery and heated outdoor dining.

 Full-service chain bar & grill providing hearty American eats in an informal setting and now it is really informal—outside under a tent with hay bales all around, almost like a country fair. I enjoying dining there last week with my granddaughter—we had the 2 for $22; two 6oz top sirloin steaks, garlic mashed for her and steamed broccoli for me plus spinach and artichoke dip to share. We started with the dip that was full of flavor, creamy and topped with parmesan cheese and served with freshly made white corn tortilla chips—very good and we didn’t stop until every morsel was gone! Lightly seasoned USDA select was not only cooked to perfection but juicy, tender and delicious as well. Both sides were ever so yummy—just wished we would have had room left over for one of the amazing sounding desserts. The menu has quite a bit to offer—fabulous drinks of the alcohol nature plus appetizers, salads, steaks, ribs, various chicken dishes, pasta, seafood, sandwiches, burgers, wraps, irresist-a-bowls, kid’s menu and family bundle meals serving anywhere from 4-8 people. Open Sunday thru Thursday 11AM-10PM; Friday & Saturday till 11PM for outdoor dining, online ordering, takeout, delivery, catering and car side to go.
