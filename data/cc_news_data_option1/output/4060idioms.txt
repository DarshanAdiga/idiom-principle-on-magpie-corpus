As young as 6-years-old, many children living in Africa are taught proverbs to help them navigate through many of life's challenges. Many African proverbs about life and wisdom are tied to the Earth and the animals who inhabit it to convey daily life lessons and procedures. Some proverbs are romantic, some are comical, and some are thought provoking.


  Here's a list of African proverbs about life, love and family from around the continent. Some are known to come from specific tribes, ethnic groups, or countries. Choose your favorites as a monthly mantra, an inspirational quote for your vision board, or just some ancestral insight to get you through the rest of your week!

In September, Apple rolled out new App Store rules that make it possible for companies like Microsoft and Google to host their game streaming apps on the iOS App Store, but since those rules require that each game on the service be individually submitted to Apple for review, it's likely far too tedious to be something Microsoft and Google actually pursue.

It is well known that Trump's parents were essentially incapable of showing love to Trump, or to anyone. This was especially true of his father, for whom all human relations were, as they are to Donald Trump now, transactional. If one was no longer of use to Fred Trump, one was disposed of, kicked to the curb, thrown under the bus, frozen out. We have seen this in spades throughout the Trump presidency. When one is no longer of use to Trump, he not only fires them, he aggressively and publicly insults them.

Mack said as of September, card sales have come back to about the same level they were last year, but restrictions on how many people can enter the store and an unwillingness to shop in person are a challenge.


  Although a number of locally owned shops near Foursided’s flagship location in the Andersonville neighborhood have closed under the strain of the pandemic, Mack said he has no plans to close and will “suffer through it at all costs.”


  Paper Source, boosted by enormous online growth early in the pandemic, has no plans to close its bricks-and-mortar operations despite acquiring 27 stores from bankrupt greeting card and gift retailer Papyrus right before the pandemic. Park said 21 of those locations have been converted to Paper Source stores with the remainder opening by the end of October. Still, the company has made adjustments like imposing pay cuts and reducing in-store staff.


  "We’re just trying to survive this period and the down cycle in business because of COVID,” Park said

Fall is in full swing and along with apple and pumpkin picking, copious amounts of plaid wearing, Oktoberfest shenanigans and sweater weather, comes leaf peeping season, which is a _big_ deal to nature-lovers and Instagrammers alike.


  Planning a weekend escape around scenic drives cascaded by trees changing colors has basically become the quintessential way to welcome fall. And the foliage fun doesn't stop there. Quaint inns, orchards and nature preserves are doing everything they can to lure socially distant travelers to their destinations ablaze in burning shades of yellow, orange and red. Think: hotel packages tailored to peepers with handy maps, corner rooms with sweeping views, spiked cider happy hours and more.

Introduction to fashion


  Arnav’s stint in New York introduced him to style that is more individualistic than designer or brand-based. “That’s where I fell in love with fashion. NGA has been in the pipeline for a couple of years now, ever since I returned to Chennai in 2018,” says Arnav. The first collection of 2020 — or Episode 01 of Season 01 — is called Phantasm, and features everything from T-shirts to dhoti pants and bandhgalas to bomber jackets. Working out of Chennai, he heads a team of designers, giving them “creative direction”.


  “Across the board, Indian menswear is under-represented. Internationally, people would immediately know what a sari is, but that’s not the case with a _bandhgala_ or a _bandi_. With NGA, we are looking to add utility to clothing and modernising silhouettes in a way that makes Indian clothing accessible,” Arnav says, explaining his aim of extending the reach of traditional outfits. The basic palette features white, black, navy or olive green as the base with maximalist prints of lions, flying fish and elephants. Look for the space camo pattern for a futuristic theme.

Bruce Power's Unit 6 Major Component Replacement (MCR) Project reached a much-anticipated milestone Oct. 1 and the company is now embarking on the next stage of the nuclear reactor's refurbishment.


  Workers have completed the preparations to begin the major component replacement with the successful installation of protective shielding and 16 bulkheads, weighing over seven tons each, to isolate Unit 6 from the operating units.


  "Reaching this milestone on plan under difficult conditions due to the COVID-19 pandemic marks a pivotal moment in MCR," said Eric Chassard, Bruce Power's Executive Vice-President, Projects & Engineering.


  With this work now complete, Shoreline, a joint venture comprised of Aecon, SNC-Lavalin and AECOM, will begin the Fuel Channel Feeder Replacement program, a key element of MCR that involves the removal and replacement of the major components: pressure tubes, calandria tubes, and feeders inside the reactor. The first group of trade workers from Shoreline was deployed into the Unit 6 reactor vault last week to execute work that had been moved up in the schedule.


  Approximately 400 tradespeople have been hired by Shoreline over the past two months, while ATS Automation has delivered the robotic tooling, which will be used to replace components, to the MCR Training Facility in Kincardine, where workers have been preparing and training.


  "After months of preparation, Shoreline is primed to successfully execute the next phase of this important project and Shoreline looks forward to continued success as we work with Bruce Power to deliver this vital project," said Thomas Clochard, Senior Vice President and Executive Lead, Nuclear, Aecon, on behalf of Shoreline Power Group.


  Patrick Dillon, Business Manager and Secretary Treasurer of the Provincial Building and Construction Trades Council of Ontario, commended Bruce Power on reaching this milestone, particularly in light of COVID-19 challenges, adding that the Life-Extension Program, which includes replacement of major components on six of the Bruce site's eight nuclear reactors, is the kind of commitment and investment that helps train Ontario's skilled trades workforce.


  "This project will result in an annual injection of $4 billion into Ontario's economy while creating an additional 5,000 jobs across the province each year and allows Bruce Power to continue to provide clean, low-cost, reliable power and life-saving medical isotopes while strengthening local communities. Our skilled tradespeople participating in this project are ready for the next stage in the journey ahead, and look forward to delivering the project and securing our future."


  The Unit 6 MCR began in January before being put on hold during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. The project resumed in late spring with strict precautionary measures being instituted to keep workers and contractors safe. Bruce Power has expanded its safety protocols around the public health crisis, recently putting into place testing and screening of select company and supplemental staff, and contractors.


  "Thanks to the combined efforts of our workers and the workers from our supply chain partners, our Unit 6 MCR has reached this important milestone on- time and on-budget," said

Solitude can be a splendid thing -- but living alone in a pandemic can become a condition to treat as well as a skill to master.


  "It has been emotional turmoil," says Aman Caur, 32, an assistant professor of English in Amritsar. "There were times when I felt the walls were closing in. But there were also times I was happy to be alone. And when that happened, I started examining my state of mind. Why was I feeling okay at certain times? How could I find that space more often?"


  At first, this made each day an emotional see-saw. "I started documenting my days and my thoughts in a journal and then something started to heal," Caur says.


  Writing, counsellors say, is a key tool in dealing with isolation. Caur says journaling helped her learn to live with her thoughts -- tackling what psychoanalyst Arunava Banerjee calls one of the greatest clouds to loom during enforced isolation: "the fear of oneself, having to face oneself".


  As Caur examined her dreams as well as her fears, she found that she could look at herself from the outside with greater ease. "The journal has become a sort of book of my life," she adds.


  The second tool is talking. Make it a point to make a certain number of phone or video calls every day. These conversations will build into a sense of security; you may be the only one in the room, but you aren't really alone.


  Inject joy into your routine. Sanam Hashmi, 30, an engineer in Delhi, started to sleep, work and eat erratically, while confined to the indoors alone in the pandemic. "With nothing to do after work, I would hit the bed at 8 pm and wake up at 3 am." She used music and books to add happiness to her day. "During this period I learnt to listen to the lyrics. I learnt the value of looking at things closely."


  Make or create. Constructive activity can add an element of variety and purpose. So construct that balcony garden, bake your own bread, perhaps even return to the crafts you enjoyed as a child. Hashmi returned to baking after a break of a year, took a slice of her cake out on to the terrace recently and ate it slowly. "I've realised I now have the time to look at the sky. I'm not sure how good I am, but I've started to paint too, and that gives me a feeling of serenity."


  If all else fails, try tragic optimism, says Dr Kamna Chhibber, head of mental health and behaviourial sciences at the Fortis Memorial Research Institute in Gurugram. "Europeans survived on this during their wars. It's about fighting with your back to the wall but also feeling good that you are able to put up that fight." It's a tactic of accepting your reality, rather than trying to force a change in it, and using that reality to build resilience.

  At the start of October Rebekah announced as one of the celebrity contestants on ITV's Dancing On Ice, and during an appearance on GMB to share the news, she opened up about the fall-out with Coleen.


  She said she'd been left with no choice but to take Coleen to court as they couldn't "settle things amicably" and that she wanted to "clear her name."


  Days later, reports emerged claiming that Coleen joked about Rebekah signing up for the ITV reality series


  An insider told The Sun : "Neither one is prepared to back down. Becky’s decision to do Dancing on Ice is understandable from her point of view. She sees it as an opportunity to prove to people that she’s not who they think she is.


  "She wants them to see her not as a snake or a grass as she’s been labelled, but a devoted mum and wife."


  The insider's comments came days after Coleen submitted a 55-page defence last week in support of her allegation against Rebekah's Instagram account.


  In the document seen by the Mirror, Coleen accuses Vardy of “habitually” leaking stories to the press in return for glowing coverage.

This is expected to reflect in the growth of the Coding Foils & Tapes market, as operations are limited to essential activities and products, thereby creating a huge void in packaging needs for non-essential commodities. On this premise, the global Coding Foils & Tapes market will experience a downtrend through the pandemic. Further complicating smooth operations are hindered operations and travel bans across the world. On the back of these factors, players operating in the global Coding Foils & Tapes market are expected to experience a steep decline in revenue flow.

A Biju Janata Dal minister has written to union minister of state for home Nityanand Rai complaining about BJP's Bhubaneswar MP Aparajita Sarangi's alleged violation of Covid-19 guidelines while celebrating her birthday amid party supporters on Thursday.


  Citing videos of Sarangi's birthday celebration with her supporters, Odisha's minister of state for home Dibya Shankar Mishra alleged that the MP had violated Covid guidelines as she was surrounded by hundreds of women without masks.


  "I would not have brought this to your notice, had this been the first occasion where the Honourable MP has blatantly violated Covid guidelines. In addition to repeated advisories, warnings and booking of at least three cases against MP for violation of Covid guidelines, there is no improvement in behaviour," Mishra wrote in the letter.


  "Such irresponsible behaviour on the part of a people's representative will demotivate the Covid Warriors and is an insult to all those who have lost their lives. And it also sends a completely contradictory message to the people at large especially in the light of the Honourable Prime Minister's repeated messages and his appeal yesterday," he said.


   


   


  Sarangi, who in July was penalised by police for violating social distancing guidelines, however denied that she had violated any Covid guidelines.


  "After arriving at Bhubaneswar two days ago, I have always been masked up. PM Modi ji has asked us to do our work with proper masking and I have not forgotten it. But did the minister raise any questions about one of his ministers and party MLA attending the funeral of party MLA Pradip Maharathy last week despite testing positive for Covid-19. Did he write to CM questioning their conduct," asked Sarangi.


  The minister further wrote that as Sarangi is a people's representative and national spokesperson of the BJP, it is important that she inspires people to follow the Covid guidelines at this very critical juncture.


  "These are tough times when people have obeyed the lockdown and sacrificed their livelihood. But the video clearly shows Sarangi surrounded by hundreds of women who are neither wearing masks nor maintaining social distance and indulging in song and dance with utter disregard to Covid guidelines issued under the National Disaster Management Act despite repeated appeals made by the Prime Minister regarding the same," he said.

Edward Jenner, as schoolbooks rightly say, developed the first vaccine. He worked out a way to infect healthy humans with a cattle disease, cowpox, so they'd get mildly sick, recover, and enjoy lifelong immunity to the deadlier (or at least disfiguring) smallpox.


  What schoolbooks don't say is how the world coped before that. They did some pretty shocking things.


  Smallpox has been around since at least the 3rd century BCE, as rashes on three Egyptian mummies indicate. The earliest record of it comes from 4th- century China. It's from the Chinese that we learn of the oldest methods of fighting smallpox, with quarantines.


  By the 15th century, they'd figured out that having a mild attack early helped develop resistance to a full-blown attack later. So healthy folk would wear the used clothes of the infected. Or try a slightly more revolting technique: they'd dry the scabs from infected people and snort the powder (often via a long silver pipe). The infection would take hold and patients would be quarantined. Some would die. But with most, the rash would clear up, and they'd be rendered immune.


  Americans have a Black slave to thank for their early inoculations. History knows him only as Onesimus. In 1716, he told his owner, a Puritan minister in Boston, about the African technique of rubbing pus from an infected person into one's skin to develop immunity. Boston society turned their noses up at such a vile suggestion. Then an epidemic struck, in 1721, killing half the city's residents. The minister teamed up with a doctor to test the slave's method -- and managed to bring down the death rate.


  Meanwhile, in the 18th-century, Lady Mary Montagu, wife of the British ambassador to the Ottoman Empire, became fascinated by how clear-skinned the local women were; none had been marked by the pox. Locals had figured out a way to inoculate children, using a needle to scratch pox matter into a healthy vein. Every autumn, they'd make an afternoon party of it, and the children would grow up without any (other) scars.


  Montagu had her son inoculated in this way, in 1718. She then took the technique back home, where Christian doctors stiffly dismissed her as an untrained woman pushing Islamic mumbo-jumbo. But she found anxious mothers willing to try it, and with every inoculated child proving immune, the tide soon turned.


  Jenner's vaccine wouldn't be developed until 1798, saving lives more reliably. But in Sudan, until the 19th century, you could 'buy' smallpox. Women would take their kids to the house of an infected child and tie a cloth on the sick child's arm. The mothers would then discuss a price for the sharing of the infection. The money would change hands and the cloth, now infused with some pus, would be tied to the healthy child's arm.


  India, in contrast, has no mention of Shitala, the goddess of smallpox and contagious diseases, before the 12th century. The earliest records note that 8,000 children contracted the pox and died in Goa in 1545. By the 1700s, accounts mention local healers performing inoculations in Bengal and Bihar. They were called tikadars. It explains why, even after Jenner's technique reached India in 1802, and India eradicated smallpox in 1975 and polio in 2014, vaccination doses are still called tika.

Rajpal Yadav is on a roll and is wrapping up film projects, stalled due to lockdown, one after the other.


  "In September, I completed Ram Gopal Verma's 'Dragon Girl' in Goa. There was some patchwork left in Farhan Akhtar's 'Hello Chalie', and have now finished 'Safaibaaz' in Lucknow," the actor said after completing his shoot in the state capital.


  In November, he will be finishing his portions in 'Hungama-2', 'Bole Chudiyan' and 'Bhool Bhuliya-2'. But, right now, he is geared up for the shooting of Hindi-Punjabi 'Mitthu Singh Da Bya' in Patiala.

  Rajpal has done his theatre academics from Bhartendu Natya Academy in Lucknow. "First I did 'padhai' (education) here, then did 'ghumai' (roaming) and now got an opportunity to do some 'safai' (cleaning) with my role in 'Safaibaaz'. If Shahjahanpur is my 'maa' (mother), Lucknow is my 'dai-maa' (granny) who has nurtured me as an actor due to which I could make a name in the world of cinema."


  The actor also went to his native village in Pilibhit. "I am very happy that UP is coming up with a film city and it's a dream come true for me. But, instead of Noida, I feel the film city should come up in Pilibhit where we have forests, foothills, plains and the Himalayas in the backdrop. I have done a comprehensive study on it and I am ready to share all the details," he suggested.

  The outgoing chair of the castle working party, Cllr Steve Tierney, says he had been hoping it would re-open for a Halloween event but that has proven impossible.


  On the castle Facebook page, he writes: “We have been hoping that the lockdown rules would ease enough to be able to do a Halloween event again.


  “Sadly, with the new six-person limit to gatherings it just doesn’t seem feasible.”


  “It looks like Covid has put paid to that, so we shall have to wait and do an even bigger and better event in 2021.


  “Sorry to un-spook you all this year, but the best is yet to come.”


  Earlier he posted that “sadly the time has come for me to move on and let somebody take over as chair.


  “There are a few improvements that I want to see complete so I intend to step down in October”.

I have a long and positive relationship with OWC drives. In fact, both of my documentaries were edited using them. So when I was approached to take a look at the new Mercury Elite Pro Dual Drive, I was incredibly enthusiastic to see what they had to offer using the newest technologies. Because of my history with the OWC products, my expectations were very high. I wanted to confirm that the Mercury Elite Pro Dual Drive was easy to use, extremely fast, durable, and portable. So with all of that in mind, it was time to take it out of the box and give it a test drive.

An Ark Valley Chisholm Trail Division III title is likely on the line Friday night when McPherson and Buhler renew their rivalry.


   


  Buhler has won three straight games after dropping their season opener at Goddard. All three Buhler wins have come against league opponents.


   


  "One of our goals every year is to win league," Buhler head coach Steve Warner said. "We're playing a good team, and a well-coached team. We'll have to be ready to go."


   


  McPherson, 2-0 in league, began the year 4-0 before last week's 41-35 loss to De Soto. The Bullpups hadn't been tested in their four wins, and head coach Jace Pavlovich believes his team will gain more from their loss than their four wins.


   


  "That game was one of the better experiences playing football in the regular season that we've had," Pavlovich said. "It really didn't even matter if we won or lost because we just wanted to play a good opponent. It was great to get that experience, and it will help Friday against Buhler."


   


  Both coaches believe Friday's game will be won in the trenches.


   


  "Their offensive line is very good, maybe the best we've seen this year," Warner said. "They're scoring a lot of points, and their defense is very solid and physical -- it's the same kind of McPherson team that we've seen the last couple of years."


   


  The Crusaders have been running the ball extremely well behind their offensive line and running back Sam Elliott. In last week's 41-21 win against Augusta, Elliott rushed for 366 yards.


   


  "It starts with the offensive and defensive lines," Pavlovich said. "We'll need to be able to control the line of scrimmage on both sides of the ball. This is true in every game, but especially true against Buhler."


   


  Both sides agree that their players get a little extra juiced for a rivalry game like this.


   


  "This is a rivalry that's healthy for both sides," Pavlovich said. "We wake up in the morning in the summer ready to beat Buhler, and I know they do the same. People say there's hatred, but it's mutual respect for each other."


   


  Currently, McPherson has a three-game winning streak against Buhler. The last time the Crusaders beat the Bullpups was the 2016 season opener.


   


  "It doesn't matter how many times you've won or lost this game, every year the record resets to 0-0," Pavlovich said. "We're just excited to have the opportunity to play."


   


  Friday's game was originally scheduled to be played in Buhler. However, Buhler is not allowing spectators for athletic events at the moment, so both sides agreed to move the game to McPherson to allow limited spectators.


   


  "Both sides talked about it and we agreed it was very important to allow parents tow watch the game," Warner said. "It would be a shame to have to watch the game on stream, especially one of this caliber."
