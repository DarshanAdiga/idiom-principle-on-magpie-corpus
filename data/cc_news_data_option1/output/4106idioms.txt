Masters of the Universe is back in a big way right now. A new film is coming (maybe), a new animated series is hitting Netflix in the next few months, and Mattel is releasing new toys to stores.

Concerning this, the African continent’s underdevelopment is painfully becoming a worrisome state despite the abundance of numerous natural resources that the continent is blessed with. In Yankah’s response, it is deducible from his tone that the consistent help and aids that most of these superpowers tend to offer to African countries might be a Trojan horse, which is to control struggling African countries eventually in the long run.
