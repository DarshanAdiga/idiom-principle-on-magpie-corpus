“The great thing about the Army-Navy Game rivalry is the bond — there is bond that forms between the Army and the Navy-Marine Corps team that is used in the fleet,” Eric said. “It’s a very serious rivalry but at the end of the day, we’re all on the same team. If our nation called, we are all working together to defeat the enemy.”

"The measures that have now been decided are due to end on Nov. 30,” insisted Bavarian Governor Markus Söder, a member of the Christian Social Union (CSU), the Bavarian sister party to the CDU. He spoke of a "four-week therapy” and added: "We understand all the concerns. But we would rather be resolute now than get stuck in an endless cycle later.” His colleague from Baden- Württemberg, Winfried Kretschmann of the Green Party, announced that the "emergency brake" would give us the chance "to ease the situation and celebrate Christmas together with our families." Even Merkel, who is said to have pressed for a more decisive approach, left no doubt that the decisions made were the right ones. "This all serves the purpose of enabling us to improve public life again in December," Merkel said at the time.

Even the National Academy of Sciences Leopoldina started calling for "effective rules for autumn and winter” in late September. The scientists there considered November to be the decisive month to still stop the second wave. A further statement, issued together with five other research organizations, pushed for more stringent restrictions. They argued that social contacts needed to be reduced by 75 percent. But the rules approved by politicians didn’t go far enough to ensure that happened. People only reduced their range of movement by just over 10 percent. During the first lockdown in March, mobility fell by around 40 percent.
 What shocked the scientists a Leopoldina even more was the spirited discussions among governors over how to relax coronavirus restrictions over the Christmas holidays. "The developments in the pandemic don’t even really allow for such considerations,” says Leopoldina President Gerald Haug. If people were to meet with their families on Christmas and friends on New Year’s Eve as they normally would, the number of new infections would go through the roof again, he argued.
 Chancellor Merkel’s office has also had its own share of failures in recent weeks. Through mistakes in communication and strategy, Merkel and Helge Braun, the head of the Chancellery, have even managed to alienate governors who would normally support them. That was quite apparent in mid-November. Merkel and Braun were urgent in their warnings to the governors in a video conference call about the rising number of infections. They also pointed out the danger of infection in schools. But the governors stalled.
 A number of governors were upset because Braun’s office had sent the draft notes for the meeting too late. Furthermore, they included new rules that had not been discussed with anyone in advance. Among them was a rule that schoolchildren could only meet up with one friend in their free time. Merkel and Braun also wanted to impose a quarantine for people who had common cold symptoms. Some of the governors were angered by the proposals. Sources say the chancellor defended herself and emphasized that the quarantine for colds was a recommendation made by the Robert Koch Institute.
 North Rhine-Westphalia Governor Laschet then held an RKI diagram on his iPad up to the camera and pointed out that this wasn’t true. He said the recommendation was to follow instructions from your doctor if you have the sniffles. In the end, Merkel’s proposal was deleted, like most of the others she made. What was left were minimal compromises.

Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said on Friday that if the UK leaves the European Union without a deal, it is bad news for all concerned.
 Speaking alongside his German counterpart Heiko Maas, Coveney also warned the EU against overconfidence. He downplayed suggestions that leaving without a deal could prove so problematic for the UK that it would be forced back into talks with the EU to rectify the situation in short order, with an even weaker hand than at present.
 "Anybody who thinks no deal now is in the EU's strategic interests because in six or 12 months time, when we start talking to the UK about putting in place a new agreement, that somehow the EU's hand will be strengthened, I don't think that shows an understanding of a British mindset," Coveney told a news conference in Berlin.
 "I think the United Kingdom will try and make whatever the outcome is in the next few days and weeks work, whether it's a deal or no deal and so all of the focus now should be on getting a deal done that both sides can live with and work with."
 Nominally, the latest deadline to reach an accord is the end of the weekend — but numerous deadlines have come and gone already and both sides are keen to hint that they won't give up until the very last. At present, the transition period during which time the UK is to all intents and purposes still a fully- fledged member of the EU's single market and customs union is set to expire at the end of the calendar year.
 ## Germany still hopeful
 Germany retains a glimmer of hope that a Brexit deal is "still possible," despite an agreement appearing less likely with every day that passes.
 "We believe that an agreement is difficult but still possible," German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said ahead of the meeting with Coveney. "We will keep negotiating ... as long as a crack of the window is open."
 "We want an agreement, but of course one that is sensible," Maas said, adding that the EU was also "prepared for the case that there is no agreement."
 British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Friday warned that "from where I stand now, ... it is looking very, very likely" that the UK would fail to strike an accord with the EU in time, comments that instantly hit the pound's value on currency markets.

CONCORD, N.H. (AP) — Police in Manchester are looking for two men accused of assaulting a convenience store worker after an argument about wearing a mask. Police said the worker told a man on Nov. 30 that a face covering was required in order to be inside the store because of the coronavirus pandemic. The two got into an argument. The man said he’d be back and left. The worker said a short time later, the man returned with another man and that they ripped down a plexi-glass barrier, jumped over the counter, and began punching him before ripping off his shirt. Police said numerous items were knocked off the counter and the credit card reader was broken. ___ NURSING STUDENTS Gov. Chris Sununu has issued an emergency order allowing some nursing students to get temporary licenses to help with staffing shortages at long-term care facilities during the coronavirus pandemic. Sununu said in a statement Friday that workforce shortages remain a challenge in New Hampshire and across the country. The order affects senior nursing students expected to graduate by May 31, 2021. Students would be supervised while providing health care services in response to COVID-19 needs. Fourteen outbreaks were announced Thursday, most at long-term care facilities.

A fair few Iron fans have a similar complex about James Hanson, who at many of his previous clubs has exposed our long-term weaknesses against quality target-men. But even he has never quite rubbed our noses in it like Van Veen did in front of the Findus last year!
 But it remains a shame that we won’t get to see what this second act might have produced. Sure, like the fixture at Glanford Park last year, he might well have been half-fit and struggling to make a concrete impact on the game.
 But you know what? He also might have rose to the occasion and produced a worthy sequel. For every Die Hard 2, there is always a Godfather 2 or Toy Story 3.
