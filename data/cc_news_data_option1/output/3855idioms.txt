Canopy's relationship with Constellation has also made a difference in Canada. The two companies worked together to develop cannabis-infused beverages that are now on the market. Canopy more than doubled its beverage production in July and nearly doubled production in August to keep up with demand. In addition to its leading share in the cannabis beverages market, Canopy claims the second-highest market share in Canada's medical cannabis market and ranks in the top three in recreational marijuana markets in most of the country's provinces.

Had this been a normal year, Nebraska would almost certainly be playing a home football game on this last Saturday of September. It likely would be a relaxing win against a nonconference foe, although even that no longer is a given. And as we all know, nothing has been normal in 2020.            Although there won’t be football on Saturday, there will be again in four weeks in Columbus at Ohio State. After weeks of trying to find a way for Nebraska to play after the Big Ten initially canceled its season, Nebraskans got their wish.

A “victory” that will be steadily eroded as mail ballots — or at least the mail ballots that are counted — turn decisively in Biden’s favor. The Hawkfish prediction of the before-and-after Electoral College count is enough to empty gun stores of the few remaining boxes of ammunition still on the shelf.            Trump will have what appears to be an unassailable lead of 408 Electoral Votes to Biden’s 130. Magically, only seven days later, the count flips and now Biden wins 334 to 204.            I don’t think I’m alone in hearing the chattering wheels of cheatery at work. Strangely, when I write the left intends to steal the election with a stamp, pushback is immediate from both thieves and victims. Many independents and Republicans mistakenly think the 128,838,342 votes cast in 2016 makes a presidential election that is too big to steal.

First, its earnings-based valuations tend to be _very low_ just as its revenue/earnings are about to peak because the market is pricing in a fall in its future earnings. On the other hand, its valuations tend to be _very high_ just as revenue/earnings are about to trough.

My earliest memories of a cornfield take me back to a time when I was 4 years old. In those days my father harvested corn by hand. The process was called “gathering corn.” Two mules would pull a mule wagon through the cornfield. The mules and wagon would knock down two corn rows while my father and our neighbor, Thomas Denton, pulled the corn from the stalks of four rows of corn on each side of the wagon. A trip through the field netted 10 rows of corn harvested.            Prior to arriving at the cornfield with the mules and wagon, my father would have pulled the “downed rows” and pitched the corn in neat piles between the rows being knocked down. As the wagon passed through the field the corn in those piles had to be picked up and pitched in the wagon. The process was called “picking up the downed row.” In later years, when we used a tractor to pull the wagon, I was glad to pick up the downed row for the privilege of driving the tractor through the cornfield.            My earliest recollections find me in the mule wagon riding along as my father and Thomas Denton pulled corn from the stalks and pitched it in the wagon. I am told that I provided them with entertainment by enthusiastically singing “Davy Crockett, King of the Wild Frontier.” I can clearly remember waking up from a nap and finding myself almost completely covered up with ears of corn. I’m not sure how they managed to miss hitting me in the head as they pitched the ears of corn into the wagon. I can also remember sitting high on top of a full load of corn as we headed out of the river bottom.

But the reality of it is, Worthington pointed out, that once it does get in, especially into a place such as a detention center, sometimes the only option is to ride it out. And the jail has been forced to do just that, but fortunately (until the newest cases) everyone has managed to recover, with the deputies returning to work. Worthington himself contracted COVID-19, even going so far as to require hospitalization and treatment, but he also has recovered and is back on the job.
 The insidious nature of the disease is part of the problem with controlling it, Worthington said. Testing each prisoner isn’t always a foolproof means of protection.
 “We have had some that didn’t even know they had it, until we tested them, and found out they had already gotten over it,” he said. “And people believing that you need to have some health issue before you get it just isn’t true. There is no rhyme or reason to it – anyone can get it.”
 Worthington said he is confident that the jail will get through it, but he said there is some concern about the “immunity” of having survived COVID-19 preventing reinfection. “From what I understand, the immunity is about three months before you can catch it again,” Worthington said. “But there is always the possibility of, after you get through the first wave, then how long will it be until it hits you again?
 “But we are following all the guidelines, and even doing more than what the guidelines recommend,” Worthington said. “We have had the antibody tests for while, too. But if you test negative one day, you can still test positive the next day or two. It is hard to keep up with, but we are doing everything we possibly can.”
 “Everyone needs to take this seriously,” Worthington said.

UNITED STATES—President Donald Trump called the deal “by far and away the biggest ever, ever done,” and praised the Democrats for working with the Republicans to get it through Congress. Looking back, it’s hard to see how we could have coped without the $2tn economic stabilization deal, which provided vital support for individuals and businesses impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.

HARRISBURG -- President Donald Trump's campaign has grown increasingly focused on making inroads in Pennsylvania to offset potential vulnerabilities in other battlegrounds.                           The president will travel to the state for the second time in a week on Saturday, hoping to attract the same rural and white working-class voters who delivered him a narrow victory here in 2016. The in-person touch, in what may become the most important battleground on the map, complements an aggressive get-out-the-vote operation that has been working for four years to find new voters by knocking on doors in competitive neighborhoods.                           Trump narrowly flipped three Great Lakes states -- Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin -- from blue to red in 2016. He has virtually no path to reelection without keeping at least one of those states in his column. His campaign has long viewed Wisconsin as his best option, but aides who requested anonymity to discuss strategy said their thinking has begun to shift.                           There are growing concerns inside the campaign, the aides said, about Trump's ability to retain Wisconsin. Even winning that upper Midwest battleground wouldn't provide the needed votes if Trump's Democratic challenger, Joe Biden, claims Arizona.                           But Pennsylvania would be enough.                           "With Pennsylvania, I don't have to make a play, we've got Pennsylvania," Trump boasted at a rally Tuesday night just outside Pittsburgh.                           That might be harder than Trump suggests.                           Despite fervent Republican efforts, no GOP nominee since George H.W. Bush in 1988 had captured the state until Trump did four years ago, winning by just 44,000 votes out of nearly 5.9 million votes cast. And as someone born in Scranton, Democratic nominee Joe Biden is also heavily focused on the state.                           Recent Pennsylvania polls disagree over the state of the race: Some show Trump and Biden in a competitive race, while others have Biden slightly ahead of Trump.                           And just as "Florida, Florida, Florida" became the moniker in 2000 for the electoral delays and controversies in the state that decided the election that year, Pennsylvania, which may be 2020's tipping point state, might have its own drama looming.                           With 3 million or more voters expected to cast ballots by mail, lawmakers, party officials and election officials are warning that the conditions are ripe for a presidential election result to be left hanging in limbo on a drawn-out vote. A partisan stalemate and lawsuits have held up fixes to glitches in the state's fledgling mail-in voting law, and Democrats are warning that as many as 100,000 or more mail-in ballots -- dubbed "naked ballots" -- could be invalidated if they aren't put in the proper envelope by people unaccustomed to voting by mail.                           Pennsylvania is anchored by large cities -- Philadelphia to the east, Pittsburgh to the west -- on opposite ends, each with sprawling suburbs. But the rest of the state is largely rural, comprised of small cities and towns where Trump ran up the score four years ago.                           He will likely need to again, as the president's prospects have slipped since 2016 in vote-rich suburban Philadelphia, where he underperformed by past Republican measures, raising the stakes on what his campaign's more aggressive outreach to new rural and small-town voters across the industrial north.                           In Chester County, for instance, Trump was the first Republican presidential nominee in more than 50 years to lose what is Pennsylvania's fourth most-populous county and once a GOP stronghold. While 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney carried the county on the western edge of metro Philadelphia, Trump fell short by 10 percentage points.                           If Trump is to carry Pennsylvania again, he cannot just add new voters in the state's expansive rural areas but must stop the bleeding outside Philadelphia, former Rep. Ryan Costello, a Republican, said.                           "If the hypothesis is Trump can increase his margin, he will have to first not allow regions where he didn't perform well to perform worse," Costello said. "That means he has to make up even more ground."                           Republicans also point to an aging population and a shrinking voter-registration edge for Democrats, down 20% from 2016's election to 733,000, according to the latest state data, although the numbers also show that many more non-voting Democrats than Republicans fell off voter rolls in the past four years.                           Despite the pandemic, Trump's campaign has prioritized in-person events, including over 4,000 meet-ups that have drawn more than 38,000 people this cycle. The president and his allies are also hitting hard in TV ads accusing Biden of wanting to ban fracking, a sensitive topic in the No. 2 natural gas state behind Texas.                           While Biden insists he does not want to ban fracking broadly -- he wants to ban it on federal lands and make electricity production fossil-fuel free by 2035 -- it might make it harder for him to win back rank-and-file union members who work on an expanding network of pipelines, power plants and processing facilities                           Biden might have an advantage in getting his message out in the state. He's outspent Trump by more than 2-to-1 in Pennsylvania from this past spring through this month, according to data from Kantar/CMAG, a market research and consulting firm. From April through mid-September, Biden had spent $27 million compared with the Trump campaign's $12.5 million.                           The campaigns had reserved similar amounts for the six-week stretch to Nov. 3, with Trump at $11.5 million and Biden at $10.1 million.                           Pennsylvania, which is tied for the fourth most electoral college votes, is "personal" for Biden, the former vice president recently acknowledged during one of his trips to his native state.                           Since the beginning of June, he's made eight in-person trips to Pennsylvania, far outpacing other states with his pandemic-limited itinerary. Priorities USA, a pro-Democrat group, has identified Pennsylvania as the likely tipping point state in the Electoral College, and it announced Thursday a new $7.3 million TV and online ad blitz in the state that will pummel Trump's handling of the coronavirus pandemic.                           Sincere Harris, a senior strategist for Biden in Pennsylvania, said the personal ties to the state are "huge" and open a path to votes that other Democrats might not get.                           "Biden is in the perfect position to come back to these voters that Trump lied to four years ago," Harris said.

Some mountain regions in south-eastern and south-western regions of Switzerland recorded about 25 centimetres of fresh snow on Saturday, according to the weather service of the SRF public broadcasting company.            Authorities were out in force across mountainous regions to clear roads blocked by snow and ice.            Meteorologists expect 50cm of snow at the altitude of 2,000 metres above sea level and temperatures in some lower-lying regions dropping below zero degrees Celsius.            The “first polar invasion of the season”, as experts describe the cold weather, is a drastic change from just a week ago, when temperatures were above 20°C.            However, Switzerland may still have its traditional ‘Indian summer’ in lower-lying regions over the next weeks once the cold snap is over, according to the weather service.

As Osborne repeatedly states in the book, his philosophy with players was to focus on how they played the game — the process of preparing, the effort they display during the game and the attitude they carry on the field.            “These are all things that we can control and that reflect on the process of athletics. Many times the end result — the win or the loss — we cannot control. It may hinge on the bounce of the football, it may depend on who has the better athletes, it may depend on an official’s call. Therefore, we spend a lot more time trying to talk about process rather than end results with our players.”
