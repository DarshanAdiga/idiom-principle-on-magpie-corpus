It’s a good idea to create a culture that encourages and nurtures strong cybersecurity practises and one of the best ways to do this is by educating staff on data protection and your policies right from the moment they join the business. Adding a cybersecurity training session to their first week can help. This doesn't have to be long, just half an hour or so to get them up to speed. Or, if you hand out welcome packs to new employees make sure there is a section within this that outlines in detail the importance of security and any key company policies regarding this.

ATLANTA - The University System of Georgia Board of Regents signed off Wednesday, July 1, on a fiscal 2021 budget that includes $2.3 billion in state funds.
 The regents got their marching orders last week (week of June 21) when the General Assembly adopted a $25.9 billion state budget that cuts spending across the board by 10%. For the university system, that represents a reduction of $278 million from last year’s spending plan.
 The damage could have been worse. When the coronavirus pandemic hit Georgia in March, prompting shelter-in-place orders that forced businesses to close and lay off employees, Gov. Brian Kemp and legislative leaders told state agency heads to prepare to cut their budgets by 14%.
 But that was revised downward subsequently to 11% and then 10% when reports from the Georgia Department of Revenue showed the downturn in the economy was not affecting state tax revenues as much as had been anticipated.
 “That gives us a little more flexibility … going into fiscal ’21,” university system Chancellor Steve Wrigley told the regents before Wednesday’s (July 1) vote.
 As a result of the lowering of the spending reduction target, the legislature restored $78 million to the system’s budget, enough to avoid furloughing any of the system’s 55,000 employees. In May, the regents authorized either four or eight furlough days for most employees, depending on their salary level.
 Lawmakers also appropriated $3.2 million to fully fund the Georgia Public Library System’s materials grants program. The grants allow the state’s libraries, particularly in rural communities, to buy books, technology and other resources.
 The university system budget also is being supported with more than $157 million in federal coronavirus relief funds.
 The fiscal 2021 state budget took effect on Wednesday, July 1.

“You can pass whatever budget you want,” she said. “If the revenues don't come in the way you'd like them to, then there's not enough money to go around for all of the priorities that are represented by that budget. So, at the end of the day, we'll have to see month-to-month what our revenues look like. It's so completely up in the air.”

It’s not enough to update staff once every few years and assume they take it all on board. If you want to reduce the risk of human error and help staff to spot the signs of a security issue, regular training is key. You need to keep staff up-to-date on any changes in policies or regulations, this can be done by email or newsletters - however you prefer to communicate with your workforce.

When the situation was first happening in March, I think most of our time was spent trying to be in contact with the airlines, trying to understand how they were going to downscale, or what their plans were. Gradually that kind of moved more internal to planning scenarios and trying to understand what this would mean for Schiphol in the short term and in the long run.

Private investors and city officials have long eyed the granary building as a potential spot for redevelopment.
 “I really think the stars are aligning,” Whitten said Wednesday at a press conference announcing the investment. “This is a great economic development opportunity for Ralston.”
 The building’s first anchor tenant will be Out of the Box, a company that sells high-end furniture and home improvement accessories that have been reclaimed from home renovations and remodels. The company opened its first location in Lincoln in 2011.
 Jody Strauch, who owns Out of the Box with her husband, Steen Lundberg, said Wednesday that the city’s Hinge project was an attractive option as the couple sought an Omaha location for a second branch of the business, which will be in a 20,000-square-foot space expected to open in August.
 A $2 million investment by Whitten and fellow investors will create a new business accelerator that will provide up-and-coming companies with guidance, support and capital investment. Whitten said the goal is to create 10 new businesses and 100 new jobs.
 Whitten and company also plan to construct Granary Green, an outdoor green space on the site that will be near Bushwackers Dance Hall & Saloon. Rick Hoppe, Ralston’s city administrator, said the space will function as a public park unless it’s being used for outdoor events. The space will feature an event lawn, seating terraces and a large electronic screen, plans show.

RAINED OFF … At Fernie on Tuesday Jupiter Pluvius held full sway and it rained, so continuously that all sports and games were called off. A large crowd accompanied the ball team, as a long programme Gf sports had been announced and a good time promised. The wet weather put a damper on the spirits of the crowd and they all arrived home in the evening, sadder and wiser. There were five ball teams present to compete for the prizes offered. Galloway and Wardner played an exhibition game in the afternoon but only a small crowd attended.

The Trans Mountain project was first approved in 2016, but stopped by the Federal Court of Appeal two years later after First Nations and environmental groups successfully argued the approval process was flawed.
 Ottawa approved the project a second time in June 2019 after undergoing additional consultation with the affected communities, but the bands still felt the government did not fulfil its duty to consult and again appealed the decision.
 The Federal Court of Appeal ruled in February the approval would stand, saying the government had made a genuine effort to hear and accommodate concerns raised. But the First Nations disagreed and asked the Supreme Court to hear the case.
 The bands still have outstanding concerns about the impact the pipeline could have on drinking water as well as ongoing concerns about the effect on marine life -- particularly the highly endangered Southern Resident killer whales -- off the B.C. coast.   Thursday's decision would appear to be the end of the road for legal arguments aimed at stopping construction on the pipeline.
 In January, the Supreme Court said the B.C. government had no authority to try and regulate what could flow through the pipeline, which as an interprovincial project sits in federal jurisdiction.
 The court also declined in March to hear a challenge from environmental groups who had been denied the right to appeal the second approval.
 The expanded pipeline will nearly triple the amount of diluted bitumen flowing between Alberta's oilsands and a marine port in Burnaby, B.C.
 Initially proposed by Kinder Morgan Canada to twin the existing pipeline that carries both refined products and diluted bitumen, the pipeline became a political symbol for the fight over whether Canada can continue to extract and sell fossil fuels and combat climate change.
 In 2019, the company's shareholders got cold feet about proceeding with the multibillion-dollar expansion, worried that legal challenges from Indigenous communities, environment groups and the B.C. government would delay construction too long.
 The federal Liberal government was unable to convince the company it could overcome the legal hurdles, and in May 2018, bought the existing pipeline for $4.4 billion with a promise to get the expansion done and then sell everything back to the private sector.
 That decision was dealt a significant blow just months later when the Federal Court of Appeal overturned the approval, halting construction. Building began anew last summer after the second approval, and continued despite the new legal challenges.
 Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has consistently tried to sell the project as his government's compromise between the economy and environment, arguing Canada can only pay for the transition to a cleaner, greener future if it takes the most advantage of its natural resources, which remain in demand around the world.
 Most oil produced in Alberta is sold at a discount because Canada is so heavily reliant on the United States as its customer. The hope is that this pipeline will carry more Canadian oil to the Pacific, where it can make its way to Asia, raising the price companies can get for the oil.

Two men allegedly involved in an auto theft scheme targeting Latinos are behind bars, while another suspect remains at large and is believed to be in the San Diego area, authorities said Wednesday.
 Abel Chairez, 40, and Juan Echeagaray, 49, are accused of perpetrating the scam that netted around $475,000 from more than 17 victims. A third suspect, Salvador Mullaly, 52, has not been captured and authorities said he should be considered armed and dangerous.
 According to the San Diego County Regional Auto Theft Task Force, the men posted job listings on social media sites, searching for Spanish-speaking drivers interested in transporting large sums of money from the San Diego area to Los Angeles County, often for supposed payments of several thousand dollars.
 When an interested party called, the perpetrators — believed to associates of an organized crime gang based in Mexico — made assurances that the purported driving job was legal and directed the victim to a meeting spot in southern San Diego County, generally near the U.S.-Mexico border.

The tips of the mesh triangles were attached to a thin halter strap that curved around Tika's neck. The garment also had shoulder straps and a wide-under-bust band. The svelte model teamed the top with a pair of white bicycle shorts that showcased her slender thighs. Of the three models, Tika was the only one who wore her long hair styled in glamorous curls.

I think we're now in a phase that we're seeing a gradual road to recovery. Airlines are trying to come back or have been able to stay, they are now trying to see how they can get the passengers back on board in a safe way. They're coping with what I think is the biggest challenge: that there are so many different rules and regulations per country. And that really is confusing for airlines but certainly also for the passengers when you're trying to bring back the customer.

In point-to-point traffic, we haven't really seen a big change from airlines saying they need longer to turnaround. Transavia start their flights from Amsterdam so the aircraft is already cleaned up before they go. There's also less catering on board, of course, so that helps the turnaround times.
