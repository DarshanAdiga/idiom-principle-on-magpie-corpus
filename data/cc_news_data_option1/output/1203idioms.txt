You've heard the rumors if you've been hanging out on social media, which has become the uncurated portal to the universe for many folks. Maybe you've heard a whisper aside from somebody who knows somebody who knows somebody: "President Donald Trump or Gov. Kay Ivey is about to lock the country or state down over the coronavirus."
   
 It's gotten worse since governors and mayors in some of the larger, more densely populated states and municipalities where COVID-19 is rampaging are taking such steps. (The numbers in New York are frightening; if it was a country, it would rank No. 7 on the infection list.)
   
 We're not going to predict the future, especially in these unpredictable times. Trump has said he has no plans to issue a lockdown or stay-at-home order for the entire U.S., and Ivey has only done it for the Jefferson County metro area, which is the most impacted area in Alabama. (As of Monday's update, the Alabama Department of Public Health reported there are 86 confirmed cases in Jefferson County.) We're sure this qualifier won't stop people from throwing this back in our faces should circumstances change.
   
 For now, we'll take the president and the governor at their word.
   
 We'll also point out that folks in those locked-down states aren't being held inside their homes at gunpoint. They can freely go out when they need to go out -- emphasis on need, not want -- to work if they're in an essential job (the definition of that is broad) and can't work from home, shop for groceries, get take-out food, go to the bank, get their cars worked on or even get some outdoor exercise and fresh air as long as they don't congregate in groups.
   
 That's not advocating restrictions on personal freedom, although we don't expect the libertarian types to hold their fire there, either. The word "lockdown," which is inherently loaded and ominous verbiage, basically just reinforces the need for social distancing right now to "flatten the curve" and get a handle on this outbreak so the disruptions and economic pain will end sooner than later. You should be doing it without governmental compulsion.
   
 Of course, this is going to go over the heads of those whose cheese has been moved -- Google Spencer Johnson if you're not familiar with the term -- in probably the most drastic fashion of their lifetimes unless they were alive during World War II. Saying "chill out" isn't likely to have much impact with frightened, uneasy people, either.
   
 Still, it's the best we can do at present. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo in his daily briefings on the crisis in his state has bluntly told his constituents, "No, this isn't normal, but it's the way things are right now. Deal with it."
   
 That's tough, but realistic talk.

It's easy to succumb to stress as we adjust to the new normal of daily routines under the cloud of COVID-19. "Social distancing" can seem like a prison sentence, especially with a house full of cooped-up kids who suddenly aren't allowed in Grandma's room. We might experience emotional whiplash between concern for the health of loved ones and the terror of watching our retirement fund go up in smoke. Those recent trips to the grocery store still haven't yielded hand sanitizer or toilet paper, and all at once we're robbed of the escape that sports or nights out on the town once provided.

For those whose jobs survived, the way they work will change. Offices will shrink and become places to pop into a couple of times a week for a catch-up, rather than somewhere to spend 40 hours sat in front of a computer (you can do that at home, after all). "We're going to need a new 'manager'," says Cooper. "Somebody with very good social skills to manage virtual teams." The changes in how our economy functions will accelerate that shift, as we rely less on shared resources like printers and speedy internet. "The only thing that stopped people doing it [before coronavirus] was the fear that it gave off the impression you weren't committed."
 Beneath the veneer of normality, however, the virus will be lurking. As summer fades, we'll see a resurgence in the number of cases that require careful management. Rolling lockdowns will be enforced in different areas of the UK to reduce demand on NHS critical care beds. In turn, that means we'll need to create some slack in the health system. "Next Christmas or so, I bet we see quite a marked increase in the birth rate," says Hunter. "You can only watch so many back episodes of _Dad 's Army_ and _Carry On_ films before you get bored with the telly."
 Especially since there'll be less new stuff to watch. With cinemas likely to stay shut for the foreseeable, studios will have to decide whether to delay films indefinitely, or make them available for streaming instead and take a bath on the box office numbers. Social distancing and travel bans will shut down production on films and TV shows, too, which will force broadcasters and studios to either dig through their archives or figure out new ways to create content.
 Schools will return, and universities too, but with fewer international students as people put their lives on pause, or carefully consider whether they want to be halfway around the world when another outbreak arrives. Just as office workers will question whether they really need to all be in the same room to do their work, so we'll see secondary schools and universities start to consider whether the emergency methods they've put in place over the last few months can become more permanent.

One possible bright spot is that, with industry and travel essentially paused, our carbon emissions will collapse. Researchers have already seen _massive drops in the release of nitrogen dioxide_, with parts of China showing pollution levels up to 30 per cent lower than normal. In northern Italy, nitrogen dioxide levels have fallen by as much as 40 per cent. Though this alone isn't enough to stave off the climate crisis, the shift in behaviour precipitated by the coronavirus pandemic is, perhaps, a sign that we can all make huge personal sacrifices when faced with a global, existential threat. That, at least, is a positive sign.  
 However, everything else will be much less rosy. We'll likely still be in recession and whole sectors of the economy will be fundamentally reshaped. "We might see professional services organisations finding it difficult to say: 'Everybody come to work'," says Nusbacher. "We might see the wreckage of some companies that can't be profitable, just as business models are put under stress right now." Europe, in particular, may think twice before restarting its hydrocarbon-based economy, and instead take the chance to think greener.
 The coronavirus won't have caused it, but it will be the rocket fuel for changes that have been long coming. "I'm not saying this one pandemic is going to cause permanent social change," says Nusbacher. "I'm saying this pandemic could be the factor that pushes this lever. The fulcrum is the longstanding set of changes. There'll be an attempt to return back to normalcy, but that won't work. Time has moved on. There was going to be social and economic change anyway, and any attempt to ignore that will run up against economic reality."
 But there will be one bright light at the end of the tunnel - a vaccine.

New Delhi [India], Mar 26 (ANI): She would become a mother in about a month from now. But the country-wide lockdown to halt the spread of Covid-19 has swept away the joys of Sapna, a daily wager in the heart of Delhi.   "I am clueless about how we will survive in future. The situation is worse as I am pregnant," Sapna told ANI.   Sapna and husband Sanjay make their ends meet doing odd jobs for about Rs 200 to Rs 400 a day. They live in a tent and call it home, at Jantar Mantar\- a place that galvanised some of the country's biggest movements including anti- corruption crusader Anna Hazare's hunger strike in 2011 and protest against Nirbhaya gang-rape in 2012.   In one of the toughest measures worldwide against covid-19, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday ordered a stringent countrywide lockdown for 21 days to cut the chain of coronavirus. And that snapped the daily earnings of Sapna and Sanjay at such a crucial time of their life.   "We are daily wagers and used to get money after working daily. But due to this lockdown, we have no money. I had got about 100 rupees by picking up garbage," Sanjay said.   Delhi has reported 36 positive Covid-19 cases so far. On Thursday, as many as 800 people had to be quarantined after they came into contact with a mohalla clinic doctor, who was found positive for the virus.   Health experts say tough measures, such as a lockdown, are must to escape a tidal wave of infections in a billion plus strong population.   "To save India, to save its every citizen, you, your family... every street, every neighbourhood is being put under lockdown," Prime Minister Modi said in a televised address to the nation on Tuesday.   The Central and state governments have assured uninterrupted supplies of food and essential items to the public. Emergency services are exempt from the lockout.   Several private sector companies, religious bodies and NGOs are coming forward to help the distress on the road.   Yet, the plight of Sapna and Sanjay seem to be dodging the sight of some good samaritans. The couple haven't had a proper meal for the last four days.   "We had just 1 kg of rice for us, which is now finished," the expectant mother told ANI.   As shops, showrooms, restaurants, business establishments, offices and metro trains remain shut, there is very little Sanjay can do to labour and bring home the money. Yet, amidst this gloom, the bond between the couple only seems to have got strengthened.   "I eat only after my wife finishes eating. What she leaves, I eat," Sanjay said.   As the adage goes, this too shall pass off, the crisis would get over- gradually, the couple would find work too.   And Sapna, like her name, dreams that they would soon have a happy and a healthy baby bouncing on their laps. (ANI)

EUR/USD stays bid and climbs to one-week tops amid sustained USD selling. The Fed's unlimited QE, $2 trillion US stimulus package weighed on the USD. Thursday's key focus will be on the US macro data - jobless claims and Q4 GDP. Following the previous session's intraday pullback, the EUR/USD pair caught some fresh bids on Wednesday and built on its recent recovery move from multi-year lows. Persistent offered bias around the US dollar, all against the backdrop of the Fed's unlimited QE, was seen as one of the key factors driving the pair higher. Investors further took comfort from the passage of a massive $2 trillion US stimulus package to offset the economic impact from the coronavirus pandemic and continued dumping the greenback. Meanwhile, the positive momentum seemed rather unaffected by awful German IFO Business Climate, which slumped to 86.1 in February - the lowest value since July 2009. Adding to this, IFO President Clemens Fuest noted in a statement that the German economy could shrink by as much as 20% in 2020, albeit did little to dampen the positive mood surrounding the major. Across the pond, the mixed US Durable Goods Orders data failed to provide any respite to the USD bulls or hinder the pair's intraday move up. The continued gaining traction for the fifth consecutive session on Thursday and climbed further beyond the 1.0900 round-figure mark, hitting one-week tops during the Asian session. It, however, remains to be seen if bulls are able to capitalize on the momentum or the pair's meets with some fresh supply at higher levels. The fact that the coronavirus continues spreading exponentially, in Europe and the US, concerns over the economic fallout/imminent global recession might extend some support to the greenback's status as the global reserve currency and keep a lid on any runaway rally for the major. On Thursday, the European Central Bank is scheduled to release the monthly Economic Bulletin. The key focus, however, will be on the US initial weekly jobless claims for the week ended March 20. Economists are looking for claims to soar to 1,000K as compared to the previous week's reading of 281K. The US economic docket also features the release of the final GDP print, which is expected to confirm that the economic growth stood at 2.1% annualized pace during the final quarter of 2019 and might fail to provide any meaningful impetus. Short-term technical outlook From a technical perspective, the overnight sustained move above the 23.6% Fibonacci level of the 1.1497-1.0636 recent slump supports prospects for additional gains. However, any subsequent positive move is likely to confront a stiff resistance near the 1.0965-70 region, marking 38.2% Fibo. level. This is closely followed by 50-day SMA, just ahead of the key 1.10 psychological mark, which should now act as a key pivotal point for short-term traders. Above the mentioned barrier, the pair is likely to accelerate the momentum further towards 50% Fibo. level, around the 1.1060-65 region. On the flip side, immediate support is now pegged near the 1.0875 horizontal zone ahead of the 1.0840 level (23.6% Fibo.). Failure to defend the said support levels might offset the near-term positive outlook, rather prompt some technical selling and drag the pair back towards the 1.0800 round-figure mark. Some follow-through selling might now turn the pair vulnerable to resume its prior bearish trend and head back towards challenging sub-1.0700 levels with some intermediate support near the overnight swing low, around the 1.0760 region.

Madrid[Spain]; Mar 26 (ANI): The tally of total positive cases in Europe surged past 250,000 in Europe on Thursday as Spain becomes the second-worst affected country after Italy in the region.   At least 4,089 people have now died from Covid-19 in Spain with a total of 56,188 cases recorded, according to Spanish Health Ministry data released Thursday, CNN reported.   But the rise in the death toll of 655 in the past 24 hours was a smaller increase than the record 738 set on Wednesday.   Spain continues to be the country with the second-highest number of fatalities from coronavirus, surpassed only by Italy. China, where the outbreak began, has had 3,291 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University figures.   Before Wednesday, Spain had recorded 47,610 total cases with 3,434 deaths.
