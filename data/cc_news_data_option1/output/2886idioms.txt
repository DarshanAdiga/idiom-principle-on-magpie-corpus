While Walmart+ can help the retailer become an integral part of its customer's daily life, Walmart is making some changes behind the scenes as well. Amazon's reigning success can be attributed to its efficient supply chain that has made same-day delivery possible. Walmart hopes to mirror this success in its own business as well.

While other schools in Bryan County are expected to announce their plans for the start of the 2020-21 school year, Silo Public Schools is preparing for business as almost usual with an opening date of Aug. 6.
   
 "We are planning to be as traditional and normal as we possibly can be," Silo High School Principal Jeremy Atwood commented. "We understand some students will want to do distance learning and we will work with those families. The ideal situation is a 100 percent normal school day."
   
 Superintendent Kate McDonald posted a thank you to parents on the Silo ISD Facebook page for their patience and encouragement over the past couple of months.
   
 She also stressed that any parent with concerns or questions about students returning to school should contact their building's principal to discuss educational plans.
   
 Atwood said the school has instituted a protocol for the beginning of each day, but social distancing on bus routes is not a possibility.
   
 "We are going to take temperatures as the kids get off the bus or come into the building," he said. "If some have symptoms, they will have to be quarantined and out 14 days or until we receive two negative tests.
   
 "We are going to sanitize rooms frequently and be preventative as possible for the safety of everyone. Masks will be optional for students and staff. There's really no way we can distance the students on the buses, so if parents want the kids to wear masks on the buses, that's their option," Atwood said.
   
 "Administrators in a five or six county radius got together about three weeks ago to come up with ideas, so most were on the same page, so this is not just a Silo thing. We feel like most schools around the area will work on a similar plan."

Following discussion at its regularly July meeting last week, the Durant City Council approved a location for a permanent memorial structure to be placed near the site of a tragic vehicle accident Memorial Day weekend that claimed the lives of four Durant teens.
   
 Hunter Ford, Jack Sarver, Fernando Flores and Kaleb Foster died following the accident, in which they were hit from behind by an intoxicated driver while sitting at the stoplight at West Main and Radio Road.
   
 Since the accident, local students and other community members have maintained a temporary memorial near the location.
   
 "It would be safer and more structurally sound in erecting something permanent," Police Chief David Houser told the council. "This has become a major site of remembrance for a lot of our students and others, but it's going to have to be cleaned up eventually. Several facilitators got together and came up with the idea of a permanent memorial."
   
 Police Officer Rick Ford, whose son Hunter passed away following the accident, spoke to the council and urged them to approve the memorial's placement at the location.
   
 All of the council members agreed that they were in favor of the proposal, but some questioned whether a different location, such as at the high school, would be safer.
   
 "Many locations were considered," Houser replied, "but this was the desired location as the primary vision of this project because of the proximity to the crash site. That is important to all those families that were affected. It is expected to run parallel to Main Street."
   
 The memorial wall reportedly was initially expected to be about 7 feet wide and 2 feet deep, with four sitting lions above. The plans have expanded and the structure could be as wide as 14 feet, according to the police chief, with a private group planning to raise all the funds needed.
   
 The council approved the request with all permit fees waived by the city.
   
 Also during the meeting, Mayor Oden Grube made a presentation to Asian Gourmet Chinese Restaurant, recognizing the eatery for donating $30,000 in hand sanitizer and personal protection equipment to local organizations including Alliance Health Center and the city of Durant during the coronavirus pandemic.
   
 "As soon as COVID-19 really began to affect us, we couldn't get our hands on hand sanitizers and face masks, and they (Asian Gourmet) stepped up and helped us out," said Emergency Management Director James Dalton.
   
 The council also presented service awards, including a half-dozen for employees with 20 years or longer with the city.
   
 Those included police Lieutenants Chris Marcy, Jesse Petty and Robert Gibson for 20 years of service. Michael Stinson, Lt. Stacy Loper and Battalion Chief Steven Wilson were each recognized for 25 years of service.
   
 Retiring firefighter Steve Kelso was also recognized by the council for his 27 years of service with the Durant Fire Department.
   
 In other action, the city council voted to approve a resolution to rename four sections of old Highway 70 within Durant city limits.
   
 The section of the highway from the corner of Mulberry and First Street running east to the bypass will be renamed Magnolia. The section from McLean Street to the bypass will be renamed East Main Street.
   
 The changes, which will be effective Nov. 1, were a recommendation of the Oklahoma State Department of Transportation.
   
 The county will follow suit in the change in order to comply with 911 standards. Approximately 40 businesses and residences will reportedly be affected by the address changes.
   
 "An address change is not a pleasant thing to go through," Councilman Jerry Tomlinson stated. "I see the necessity though, and think it's in our best interest."
   
 Council members also voted for a proposal to add extra lighting, including LED lights, throughout the downtown business district.
   
 The proposal initially went through the Tourism Authority with tremendous approval, according to Durant Chamber of Commerce Vice President Curtis Armor.
   
 "I'm incredibly excited about getting this done," he commented. "It will light it up and make it pedestrian-friendly for those coming into town. It will make direct dividends to the city for years and years to come."
   
 The council also issued approval for a professional services agreement with Wall Engineering Firm for engineering services for the Smart Meter Conversion project. Total estimated cost is $3.6 million according to Public Works Director Marty Cook.
   
 "We have the loan and one-and-a-half-million-dollar grant to get this started," Cook told the council. "This work order will allow me to start meeting with Wall Engineering and move forward. We hope to have bidding for construction done in October and equipment on the ground by December.
   
 "Software has to be integrated into the system. Every one that is in the ground is one less we have to read. We really start seeing the payback at that time."
   
 Meanwhile, a proposal to rezone property near the intersection of the Highway 70 bypass and Cemetery Road to industrial was denied at the meeting.
   
 The council also extended the current state of emergency due to the pandemic through Aug. 12.

MACOMB -- During a time filled with uncertainty for many students and their families, Western Illinois University held two open forums on Tuesday over the virtual platform Zoom for students and parents. Led by Interim President Martin Abraham, who was accompanied by a panel of University officials, topics of discussion included the upcoming academic year, the impact of COVID-19 on university functions, and the return to campus. Participants were able to send in questions and have them answered in real-time over video.
   
 Abraham said that current enrollment is at approximately 6,450 to 6,500 students, which is reportedly behind by about 3 percent from last year.
   
 "This is actually very positive because we have senior classes that have gone that are very large and freshman classes that are coming in. We're running ahead of our freshman class -- not just last year's freshman class, but the freshman class from two years ago," said Abraham. "We're very optimistic that we're going to have increases in new student enrollment, and our enrollment is going to start trending up very quickly."
   
 The academic year will begin on Aug. 24 with face-to-face instruction ending on Nov. 20. After Thanksgiving break, students will begin two weeks of alternative format classes and will be encouraged to not return to campus.
   
 Officials said there will be several class formats available to students for the fall semester, such as face-to-face and virtual classes. Approximately 20 percent of classes will be online, which is reportedly two times the typical number of online classes. Class sizes will be reduced and classes have been arranged to spread out the usage of classrooms.
   
 John Smith, interim vice president for Student Services, said that COVID-19 testing will be available on campus, but those with reliable transportation will be encouraged to visit the McDonough District Hospital for testing due to facility sizes. Currently, officials are looking into saliva-based COVID-19 tests that would allow individuals to be tested twice each week throughout the semester. The University would reportedly cover the costs for these tests. However, a plan for this is not in place yet.
   
 If a student were to contract COVID-19, the student would be moved into isolation, and any roommates or those suspected of having the virus would be moved into quarantine. Isolation separates those with COVID-19 from those without. Quarantine is for individuals who don't have symptoms but were exposed to COVID-19. The purpose of the quarantine is to keep them from unknowingly infecting others. Both groups would take classes online for that time and the necessary departments would be contacted. Students would receive a caseworker who would contact them daily. Students in isolation and some in quarantine would be moved to housing designated for such a purpose; essential items and meals would be brought to the student.
   
 Two free face masks will be provided to all WIU students, staff, and faculty. Individuals will be able to wear their own face masks that meet CDC requirements and may buy replacement WIU-themed masks from the University Bookstore. Masks will be required to be worn in all University-owned indoor spaces and outdoor spaces when social distancing cannot be maintained.
   
 According to Joseph Roselieb, executive director of Auxiliary Services and Risk Management, students will be encouraged but not mandated to quarantine themselves for 14 days prior to returning to campus. Students are encouraged to not travel nor visit home unless for essential needs. If students travel, they are asked to disclose to the University details related to their travel such as where they are traveling to, the duration of travel, the means of travel, and what their intent is to help with the consultation.
   
 Residence halls will be open. Social distancing is encouraged in areas such as lounges, hallways, and bathrooms. Families will be allowed to visit students but will not be allowed in residence halls. Troy Rhoads, executive director of Facilities Management, stated that residence halls and bathrooms will be thoroughly cleaned on a daily basis while frequently-touched surfaces will be cleaned multiple times per day. WIU is reportedly looking to hire more staff to address these additional cleaning needs.
   
 Multiple-occupancy dorms are still available as there were reportedly not enough single rooms for all students. Conference floors have been opened to allow for increased social distancing. The Student Development and Success Center is working with students and officials to accommodate any specific needs on a priority basis.
   
 Dining halls will be open with limited capacity and food will be available in carryout or grab and go options. There will be distanced tables available, but students are encouraged to eat in their dorm rooms.
   
 Regarding sporting events, Abraham said that the University is still weighing its options. Currently, no spectators are allowed for indoor events. Hanson Field may be seated at 20 percent capacity.
   
 Extracurriculars and clubs will be allowed to meet in spaces which allow for social distancing. Officials said they would rather have students participating in organized activities than to go out partying. In light of this, WIU is hoping to host more activities than in a typical semester. Abraham is hopeful that job and internship fairs could be held outdoors. Off- campus jobs and internships are permitted.
   
 Billy Clow, interim provost and academic vice president, said that marching band is expected to resume. Marching band as well as other musical ensembles would be broken into smaller sections. Larger choirs and bands will be unable to do full public performances, but other possibilities such as online performances are currently being looked into.

SAVANNAH, Ga. (WTOC) - Hurricane season anxiety is nothing new. But, the next round of storms is happening in the COVID-19 era and may bring new worries.“The fear of, okay, having to pick up and leave when a hurricane does come, being kind of packed into a hotel, maybe, in a hot spot or something like that, you know. I do have a lot of concern and fear around that,” Heather Sueirro said.You're not the only one feeling anxious. General unease can be expected during uncertain times.“People are noticing an increase, just, in uncertainty. Not exactly sure what the future holds and as uncertainty grows, stability lessens. That can absolutely generate increases in anxiety, stress, feeling overwhelmed – all those things,” Margaret Alexander said.The same holds true for hurricane season – uncertainty – and anxiousness that comes with it. But, remember, it's not just family decision- making adults that are at risk."Anxiety is not specific to adults or to children. It is a global, universal feeling that many of us feel at different points."Just like adult worries, children's concerns should be met with empathy and truth."Make sure you respond honestly as long as it is developmentally appropriate but respond honestly. Inaccurate information or misinformation actually breaks the bonds of trust."It's interesting, though, the same hurricane plan that the first alert weather team suggests covering your physical need can also help your mental state.“Remember the things that are real, like, I’m safe… I have a place to go… I have a plan. You know, having a plan doesn’t mitigate everything, but it can help with some of that anxiety,” Rebecca Fain said.Knowing what you and your family are going to do can put your mind at ease. But, also, remember that sometimes we just must roll with the punches and just do the best that we can."These are hard and weird times. We're all trying to navigate – we've got hurricane season, we've got school trying to start, colleges and school."Remember, we’re all in this together. Let’s be here for each other.

 At his core, White is competitive. He was when he played sports at Macon High School and has been since he began playing in golf tournaments in his mid-20s. In 2011, White won his sixth Decatur Men's City Championship and stepped away from the tournament for personal reasons.
 He kept golfing on the side and the people who shared a course with him knew he hadn't lost his game. Young golfers like Wes Hillen, Christian Crabill and Hunter York came through the ranks and won the men's city. All while White, who had the third-most all-time wins, kept his name out of the running.

OLD FRONTENAC, Minn. — The tangled deciduous woods that surround the southeastern Minnesota village of Old Frontenac are busy with sound. Especially at dawn and dusk, they echo with birdsong. Wind whooshes through live trees and rattles dead ones. At night, coyotes trade lonesome calls with faraway trains.
 Of late, a new sound, melodic, often melancholy, has floated through the woods.
 Virginia Oliver, 73, of New Frontenac, heard it as she watered flowers in the Old Frontenac cemetery. “I couldn’t quite make out what it was,” she said. “I thought it must be a horn, but I didn’t know right away where it was coming from. It was a concert for one — for me.”
 Sonda Featherstone, 63, of Florence Township, was riding her bike east on Goodhue County Road 2 when “I heard a sound far off coming closer and closer. It was a trumpeter swan descending right at me.” For a moment, she said, she thought it would land on her.
 “I also heard another unusual sound,” she said. “I came around the bend and there was a man playing a French horn. I believe the trumpeter swan heard it too and possibly thought it was me on my bike.”
 The source of the beguiling sounds was Kestrel Wright, 38, of Red Wing. Several days a week, he drives south to the rest stop off Hwy. 61 and County Road 2, an entry point to Old Frontenac and to two Frontenac State Park hiking trails. Sitting atop a picnic table, he runs through strength and breathing exercises and arpeggios, then practices for an upcoming audition and for his now largely-in-hiatus roles with the Fort Snelling Army Band and the La Crosse (Wis.) Symphony Orchestra.

TYLER, Texas (KLTV) - One of the hallmarks of good stewardship is planning for the future. We do it as individuals and communities. And when we fail to plan, which we all have at different times, the sting of lack of planning lingers. And when it comes to future concerns in our communities, traffic is at the top of the list in East Texas. Tyler is in just such a spot. The city has been blessed with solid growth the past few decades and that growth will continue whether you like it or not. Along with that growth comes infrastructure needs, new fire stations, new courthouses, schools and utilities. Traffic is already a challenge around the major arteries into and around the city. Relief on South Broadway won’t happen anytime soon, so Old Jacksonville Highway is being expanded. Traffic flows also show there is need for an overpass on Loop 323 at Old Jacksonville and the state is ready to move forward. But businesses along that intersection are pushing back. And that is short sighted. No doubt, we need more design attention to remove business concerns as much as possible, but ignoring this problem will only make it worse. The Tyler Area Metropolitan Planning Organization will soon vote on supporting this project or not and without their support, it will likely die. Now, even if approved, it will be years before any ground will be broken so there is time to find design solutions, but voting this down is not the way to go. Tyler cannot afford not to plan, so keeping this overpass alive will make for a Better East Texas.Copyright 2020 KLTV. All rights reserved.
