MIAMI
 The moment seemed to capture the super-heated emotions of a summer of national protest: A young Black teenager whacked a Miami police officer over the head with a skateboard during a chaotic demonstration.
 The social-media jury, predictably, was outraged and divided. Either the kid was a thug who ought to be thrown behind bars or the cop, who also happened to be Black, was part of an oppressive force inflaming what had been a peaceful Black Lives Matter demonstration.
 But five months later, maybe a lesson -- and a little hope -- has emerged from the violent clash between 17-year-old Michael Marshall and Miami Police Office Raymon Washington. A few weeks ago, Washington agreed to meet Marshall in a conference room at the Miami-Dade Children's Courthouse.
 Marshall, a standout Northwestern High football player who had never before been in trouble, wept as he read a letter of apology, then peppered the officer with questions about police work. Washington, at 27 just a decade older, shared that he had suffered a major concussion in the attack, only the latest in over a dozen dating back to his own days of playing football.
 They talked. They listened. They found some common ground. And against the odds, Washington and Marshall have since formed a friendship and bond, the officer now a mentor to the kid that struck him.

Nov 26 (Reuters) - European shares inched higher in early trade on Thursday, but gains were limited as an extension of coronavirus restrictions in Germany and grim economic growth forecasts for the United Kingdom dented sentiment.
 The pan-European STOXX 600 rose 0.1%, with tech and healthcare sectors leading gains. The benchmark index ended a four-day winning streak in the previous session as investors cashed in on gains after a vaccine-fuelled rally.
 Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Wednesday Germany will extend restrictive measures imposed early this month to rein in a second wave that is sweeping much of Europe, until at least Dec. 20, as COVID-19 infection numbers remained high.
 UK's domestically exposed stocks stabilised after a sell off in the previous day, as Finance Minister Rishi Sunak warned the economy was on course to shrink by 11.3% this year and unveiled plans to borrow amounts not seen before in Britain's peacetime.
 Trading volumes are expected to be thin in light of the Thanksgiving holiday in the United States.

In a note about the collection, Murali has put down, “....we need to come to terms with the outer and the inner, the _akam_ and _puram,_ of our existence. When we are in a gallery with paintings on display we begin to recognise this. The COVID-19 pandemic situation appears to have necessitated this space and occasion. This is the time for our introspection, recognition of our true senses. Therefore, my Interior Spaces.”
 It is the 17th solo exhibition for Murali, who has been part of group exhibitions held across India and abroad. Having evolved his own style of abstraction, he, however, believes that there is nothing called abstraction in art. “Everything is abstract. When a child draws a mountain and sunrise, he or she makes a few lines here and there and fill it with colours. But, in nature, there is nothing like an outline with colours inside or outside. So what the child draws is also a kind of abstraction. However, unfortunately, people look for a sense of resemblance in art and try to find meaning. When they fail to do so, they get worried about an abstract work,” he says.
