In 1873 Peter Wachter and Adolphus Hirsch bought the store naming the business “Wachter and Co.”. Mr. Wachter was the manager and A. Hirsch the assistant. By 1874 the business was dissolved and A. Hirsch became the sole owner and named the business the Pioneer Store. Mr. Wachter moved to Barron Wisconsin and then Cumberland, Wisconsin. (“Historical and Biographical Album of the Chippewa Valley”) At one time Mr. Hirsch moved an old school building behind his store and offered dancing lessons. Mr. Hirsch would move his business to the corner of present day 8th and Main. There was a small store and the post office located at this site. Mr. Hirsch was the deputy post master. (The post office would remain in the location of 8th and Main until a new post office was built on the corner of 10th (US 63) and Main.) The Hirsch business burned in 1884.


  In 1879 Ole Christensen sold his three-year old meat market in the former Hirsch building on the south side of today’s Main Street to Wm. Allyn and his partner Mr. Porter. Mr. Christensen had been in business for three years. As of 1880 Wm. Allyn still had a meat market at the site. Also, in 1880 Arntson and Stronks had a business at the site. The building would burn in the fire of 1884. Mr. Allyn carried no insurance and suffered a loss of $700 for the building and $150 for the stock. (“1901 Baldwin Illustrated”) Mr. Allyn would rebuild at the site. (Sandy Burleigh’s book)


  The building was sold in 1890 to C. Snoeyenbos. After the fire of 1893 a new brick double store was built by C. and L. Snoeyenbos. C. Snoeyenbos and son had a general merchandise business in half of the building, selling farm produce, baled hay and shipping straw. Louis Snoeyenbos was the manager of the store. The other half of the building would become “Stronks & LaPage” sellers of hardware, tin ware and farm implements. (“1901 Baldwin Illustrated”; B. F. Decker, “Baldwin Bulletin”, March 1926)

Sardar, a farmer in Aziz Abad, said his mosque no longer offers evening prayers because of the volatile security situation.
 Walls in his village have been destroyed by fighting and the roads are all but abandoned.
 Separated by the war, some of Sardar's family live under the Taliban, divided by a no man's land of desert.
 "All our families are split... for the past 18 years I have not seen their happiness or sorrow, I have not attended their funerals," he said.
 \- Dwindling US support -
 The peace talks came after the Taliban and Washington signed a deal in February, with the US agreeing to withdraw all foreign forces in exchange for security guarantees and a Taliban promise to start talks.
 "Since the talks began, the fighting has intensified every day," said Ahmad Ikhlas, a police commander with hearing damage from a recent Taliban truck bombing.
 "One of our colleagues died in the explosion a couple of weeks ago. After the blast, I became deaf."
 Such scenes are playing out across Afghanistan, with the Taliban harassing Afghan army and police bases and launching large-scale attacks, including one on Lashkar Gah, the capital of neighbouring Helmand province.

Agricultural advocacy group TimberUnity has earned kudos for its aid efforts during the wildfires that devastated many Oregon farms, forests and communities.
 Hewing to their stated mission “to protect rural Oregonians and our natural resource communities,” the group on Sept. 12 wrangled a convoy of trucks from the Klamath Basin area to haul 170 tons of donated hay to feed displaced animals from burned-out farms and ranches in the Willamette Valley.
 The idea of bringing in the hay “just spread,” said Fred Simon, a Malin, Ore., farmer who headed up the hay deliveries.
 A second delivery was on the group’s schedule to be unloaded in Tangent, Ore., on Sept. 26, according to TimberUnity board president Mike Pihl of Vernonia.
 “TimberUnity members are givers, not takers,” Pihl said. “We are very happy as a TimberUnity family to help out. We don’t consider ourselves heroes, but we go any direction we can to do just what good Americans would do.”
 He said the group originally wanted to help Klamath Basin farmers and ranchers with efforts to get regulators to provide more water to their farms and ranches. As an offshoot of those contacts, Simon, who owns a small fleet of semi-trucks, decided to organize the hay-truck convoys to aid the victims — animals and people — of the fires.
 “Alone we can do little, but together we can do something BIG,” said TimberUnity board member Angelita Sanchez. “TimberUnity has been working behind the scenes incessantly … and will continue to do so. The emergency won’t stop today, it will go on and on for months, and we will still be there helping.”
 “We have a GoFundMe campaign, too, to make sure those that fall through the cracks won’t be forgotten,” she said. “We’re going to keep raising funds, moving livestock, securing donations, buying supplies and making sure no Oregonian who needs our help is left behind.”

Lo que esta haciendo el Sporting es una prueba mas de que el futbol vive de la incertidumbre. Y lo hace muy bien, ya que esa incapacidad que le rodea para predecir lo que ocurrira cada jornada no existe en ningun otro deporte, donde el ultimo nunca gana al primero. De ahi el seguimiento que tiene, las filias y fobias que provoca y la pasta que genera. Pocos podian aventurar que el nuevo proyecto del Sporting, con cambio en el generalato de la direccion deportiva y del banquillo, iba a ser de record con los mismos jugadores que el año pasado decepcionaron a su gente. Entre ellos, entre la Mareona, ya no estara Marino Fernandez. El corazon del peñista rojiblanco, el que junto a Tino el Roxu rego Gijon en 1988 con 10.000 millones de las antiguas pesetas gracias al Gordo de la loteria, dijo basta.

Quince años despues, su equipo sigue habitando en Segunda.

Though the Cougars might be a big unknown to most of college football, Rolovich said the months of not being allowed on the field because of COVID-19 "really gave us time to focus on the personal qualities of each individual team member."
 His message to his team is that it has a great opportunity. Rolovich believes this shortened and strange season is a positive for an unknown team like his.
 "I think the team that can get into the rhythm and can get on a roll  I mean, you win a couple, you get on a roll, and boom, you're sitting in first place," Rolovich said. "There are going to be weather issues for teams coming up here, there's going to be travel issues, and it probably helps with how I do things  not necessarily everything has to be this way, and things don't necessarily upset me. We can go with the flow of change pretty easily."
 That said, for the Cougars to surprise the pundits, they will need positive answers to several questions.
 What we know is that WSU has perhaps the conference's best offensive player in running back Max Borghi, a top-tier punter and kicker, several returning talented receivers and a veteran offensive line. After that?
 "Quarterback is a question mark," Rolovich said. "Defensively, probably question marks throughout. It's not going to be just one position group dominating because I am not sure there is a position group on the defense that is in that position right now. Lots of question marks, but I feel there are going to be a lot of contributors on defense."
 The most notable change will be at quarterback, where a three-way battle ensued to replace Anthony Gordon, who threw for a Pac-12-record 5,596 yards and 48 touchdowns as a senior, leading WSU to a 6-7 record that included a loss in the Cheez-It Bowl.
 Freshman Jayden de Laura emerged as the starter, beating out redshirt sophomore Cammon Cooper and redshirt freshman Gunner Cruz. He will be the first true freshman to start a season opener at quarterback for the Cougars.
 The 6-foot, 195-pound QB had the advantage of playing in the run-and-shoot offense while at Saint Louis High in Honolulu, where he led his team to state titles the past two seasons. Last year he threw for 3,421 yards and 29 touchdowns and rushed for 345 yards and eight touchdowns while being named state player of the year.
 Rolovich said de Laura impressed coaches and teammates this past month, but noted that as a freshman, he is bound to make some mistakes.
 "He comes in with a good feel of the offense as far as how you play as a quarterback, how you use your feet, how you use your eyes and body language to manipulate people," said Rolovich, who will share play-calling duties with offensive coordinator Brian Smith. "I think he's got a real live arm for a true freshman that is able to succeed at this level, and I think it hasn't been too big for him so far.
 "We have to continue to coach him through pressure situations and making good decisions, but he came with a purpose when he came off the plane and he earned the respect of all the players because of the way he has practiced."
 Having Borghi to hand off to and throw to should make the transition easier for de Laura. Borghi got limited opportunities to run the ball in Leach's Air Raid offense but should get a lot more chances to carry the ball in the run- and-shoot based on how Rolovich's teams played at Hawaii.
 "He's very talented, and I think he's enjoying developing into more of a running back instead of just a pass-catcher out of the backfield," said Rolovich of Borghi, a junior who rushed for 817 yards last season (6.4 yards per carry) and caught 86 passes for 597 yards. "And I think the offensive line has enjoyed developing some of the run schemes."
 That line, which some believe is the strength of the team, will be led by tackles Abe Lucas and Liam Ryan and guard Josh Watson, who have combined to start 77 games at WSU.
 The defense, under new coordinator Jake Dickert, will play a 4-2-5 scheme instead of the 3-4 defense that the unit played last year. That linebacker Jahad Woods, in his fifth year in the program, is back to lead the defense should help make the transition easier. His 141 tackles last season was fourth-most in the nation.
 WSU athletic director Pat Chun said last month on radio that he thought the defense might be ahead of the offense going into Week 1.
 That's a reflection of the defense and the defensive staff, said Rolovich, whose team was one of three in the Pac-12 not to get in any spring practices, along with Washington and Colorado. "I don't remember when (Chun) said that, but that's fine. As long as we win football games, I don't care."
 Rolovich said he has been impressed with how his players have handled all the things that come with playing during a pandemic, including the COVID-19 testing every morning. Rolovich said he doubts he would have handled it that well when he was in college.
 But what that means on the field is a question. Just like most things about this team this year.
 "There is more opportunity right now for an unknown team than at any other time in recent history," Rolovich said. "We have a chance to jump on people, and we've just got to be ready. I don't know if I would give you a goal (for number of wins). But if we are able to play with constant effort and play the game of football with the right qualities, as far as lack of selfishness and really doing it for a greater good, I think that will be a successful season, because that will also lead us to more wins."

LONDON - A British couple have thanked their lucky stars after a garage full of bin bags left to them by a neighbour yielded a trove of Star Wars toys worth £400,000 ($525,000).


  The couple, from Stourbridge in central England, were initially unsure what to make of the jumble of dolls and spacecraft their neighbour had spent decades collecting, _The Times_ newspaper reported Thursday.


  Their son called in an auctioneer, who found a treasure trove of Star Wars memorabilia including action figures still pristine in their sealed packaging.


  "A lot of them were a bit damp because of how they've been stored but generally it's the best Star Wars collection I've ever seen," Chris Aston of Aston's Auctioneers, told _The Times_.


  "We had a huge amount of interest from all over the world and were always expecting the sale to do very well," Aston said of the auction.


  Going under the hammer was a Star Destroyer Commander, one of only two known examples still to be in its original packaging, which sold for £32,500 ($42,000) including fees, the Times said.


  A Palitoy Jawa still in its packaging -- and believed to be one of only 10 in existence -- fetched £27,280 with fees.


  A set of eight figures from "Return of the Jedi" that cost only £1.59 each when they were bought new in the 1980s, went for £1,400.


  From Storm Trooper helmets to R2D2's eye, memorabilia from one of the world's biggest movie franchises can fetch eye-watering sums at auctions.


  In 2015, a Luke Skywalker doll, which hit the market in 1978 as a children's toy, sold for $25,000 at an auction organised by Sotheby's and eBay.


  Aston said the Stourbridge couple would be "thrilled" with the unexpected windfall.


  "I don't know if they have any specific plans but it must feel like they've won the lottery," he said.

Emery & Sons workers and the personnel of two other construction companies set aside competitive urges and business rivalries to come together as a community in fighting the recent wildfires in the Santiam Canyon.
 “We’re competitors but also very good friends,” Emery manager Dan Vannoy said of his company’s relationship to K & E Excavating of Salem and Keizer’s Turney Excavating. “There’s a lot of camaraderie between all of us, and when somebody’s in need of something we do whatever we can to help out.”
 He said a lot of his workers are farm kids and loggers and have emotional ties to the land, so “it’s a natural thing for the community to work together in times of need.”
 Vannoy said the fires impacted “a significant population that worked for us, including myself,” as he had to evacuate his family from their home north of Scio. He added that a couple of his employees “lost their homes and everything they had.”
 He said he knew there was a need for help in the canyon and that things were moving fast. The construction companies’ workers brought in excavators and bulldozers and other equipment to fight the fires, and water tankers and pumps to access private water sources such as lakes and ponds for the suppression efforts.
 Emery & Sons also put to use some of the parking lot and empty land at their new location on southeast Lancaster Drive in Salem to house both employees’ and evacuees’ recreational vehicles and campers.
 “We were able to provide them with power and fill up their water containers, too,” he said.
 “At the end of the day, in the business we’re in, we’re always striving to make a difference and trying to help people that are in need, because you never know when you’re going to be needing something yourself.”

It’s customary at Staples for juniors to park at Wakeman fields. But having to wake up 30 minutes earlier to get a decent parking spot on top of the 10 minute walk, especially in the winter, isn't fun. So, I think most juniors would opt to park on campus in a heartbeat, if they could.

 WASHINGTON, Nov 6 (Reuters) - U.S. employers likely hired the fewest workers in five months in October, in what would be clearest indication yet that the end of fiscal stimulus and exploding new COVID-19 infections were sapping momentum from the economic recovery.
 The Labor Department's closely watched employment report on Friday will underscore the challenges the next president, whether it is incumbent Republican Donald Trump or Democrat Joe Biden, confronts to keep the economy growing as it heals from the deepest recession since the Great Depression.
 Biden inched closer to victory on Thursday in an exceedingly close U.S. election, while Trump alleged fraud without providing evidence, filing lawsuits and calling for recounts in a race yet to be decided since polls closed on Tuesday.
 "The October jobs report is likely to show evidence of a weakening labor market," said Dean Baker, senior economist at the Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington. "This is an urgent problem facing whoever will be in the White House."
 Nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 600,000 jobs in October after rising 661,000 in September, according to a Reuters survey of economists. That would be the smallest gain since the jobs recovery started in May and leave employment 10.1 million jobs below its February peak.
 The employment report is also expected to show increases in the ranks of people who have permanently lost their jobs, as well as those who have been out of work for more than six months.
 A contested election reduces the chances of another coronavirus rescue package from the government this year. Even if more fiscal policy is agreed on, it will likely be smaller than had been anticipated before the election.
 That will shift the spotlight to the Federal Reserve.
 The U.S. central bank kept interest rates near zero on Thursday. Fed Chair Jerome Powell acknowledged the pace of improvement in the economy and labor market had moderated, noting that the recovery would be stronger with more fiscal support.
 More than $3 trillion in government pandemic relief for businesses and workers fueled a historic 33.1% annualized rate of economic growth in the third quarter. That followed a record 31.4% pace of contraction in the April-June quarter.
 Lack of fiscal stimulus and spiraling new coronavirus infections across the country have put the economy on a sharply slower growth path heading into the fourth quarter. Restaurants and gyms have moved outdoors, but cooler weather and the resurgence in COVID-19 infections could leave many in trouble.
 Even if states and local governments do not impose new restrictions on businesses, consumers are likely to stay away, fearing exposure to the respiratory illness. The United States set a one-day record for new coronavirus cases on Wednesday with at least 102,591 infections, according to a Reuters tally.
 DOWNSIDE RISK
 "The virus is still keeping many people from going to their local restaurants, bars and cafes, and this continues to weigh on the employment numbers for small businesses," said Torsten Slok, chief economist at Apollo Global Management in New York.
 "Given half of U.S. employment is in businesses with less than 500 workers and given the lower likelihood of additional fiscal support, this is a downside risk to nonfarm payrolls over the coming months, including tomorrow."
 Large corporations are also not immune. Exxon Mobil last month announced 1,900 layoffs in the United States. Boeing said it expected to eliminate about 30,000 jobs, 11,000 more than previously planned, by end-2021.
 A below-forecast payrolls number for October cannot be ruled out. Reports on Wednesday showed hiring by private employers missed expectations by a wide margin last month and employment in the services sector industry slowed.
 Data from Homebase, a payroll scheduling and tracking company, showed the number of employees working last month little changed from September.
 Overall job growth in October was likely restrained by the departure of more temporary workers hired for the 2020 Census, and tight budgets at state and local governments.
 Retailers normally start hiring for the holiday season in October, a practice that was upended by the pandemic. According to economists at JPMorgan, this could throw off the model the government uses to strip out seasonal fluctuations from the data and weigh on nonfarm payrolls.
 The unemployment rate is forecast falling to 7.7% from 7.9% in September. That is not a true reflection of the labor market's health as the jobless rate has been biased down by people misclassifying themselves as being "employed but absent from work."
 At least 21.5 million people were receiving unemployment benefits in mid- October. Many people, mostly women, have dropped out of the labor force to look after children or because they fear contracting the virus.
 "Lingering coronavirus fear, a slowing economic recovery and reports of childcare challenges are making discouraged workers more reluctant to rejoin the official ranks of those seeking work while pushing others to leave the labor market for the time being," said Kathy Bostjancic, chief U.S. financial economist at Oxford Economics in New York.
 With labor market momentum ebbing, average hourly earnings are forecast rising 0.2% in October after gaining 0.1% in September. The average workweek is seen steady at 34.7 hours. (Reporting by Lucia Mutikani; Editing by Dan Grebler)

A Good Samaritan brought Rio to Cincinnati Animal Care, Hamilton County’s animal shelter, on Tuesday. Shelter staff members were told he had been put in a trash bag and dumped on the side of the road.“There could’ve been something completely malicious there. Obviously, leaving a puppy in a garbage bag is never a good idea or a good thing to do," Meaghan Colville, the shelter’s director of lifesaving operations, said.Colville says they quickly learned that Rio is parvo positive. According to the American Veterinary Medical Association, canine parvovirus is highly contagious and affects dogs' gastrointestinal tracts. Vets say it can cause damage to their intestines and immune systems, and it can also lead to septic shock and death.“That’s the hardest part about these parvo puppies," Dr. Gretchen Goode with Eastgate Animal Hospital said. "They just, they have to want to live. They have to want to live, or else they’re not gonna.”Two days after he showed up at the shelter, Rio is slowly recovering, but his vet team says he has a long way to go.“I’m cautiously optimistic. The fact that he’s made it this far, and he’s still improving, I think we’re gonna keep going on that trend," Taylor said. "I think he’s only going to keep getting better, but the first 48 hours were definitely unsure for him.”Shelter directors say parvo is preventable through vaccinations, so they encourage pet owners to vaccinate their animals.They also hope pet owners will rely on community resources if they are having a hard time taking proper care of their pet.“People know they don’t need to leave it on the side of the road, they can come to us before it gets to that level of suffering," Colville said.According to Colville, no one is currently facing criminal charges in Rio’s case because they do not have any leads on what happened.The shelter is taking donations to help pay for Rio’s treatments. They have started a GoFundMe page to collect donations online.See a spelling or grammar error in our story? Click here to report it. Please include title of story.Copyright 2020 WXIX.

KINGSTON - If Pamela Cluff-McDevitt tells you something about the game of soccer you'd best listen to what she has say. She definitely knows what she's talking about.


  Before Cluff-McDevitt was a Kingston Youth Soccer Association board member and a youth team coach, the 40-year-old native of the town was a tremendously talented soccer player herself. How good you ask? Good enough that last month the Fairfield University graduate was chosen for the Metro Athletic Atlantic Conference's 40th Anniversary All-Star team.


  "I was honored to be selected with the level of talented players that also made the list. That's 40 years of some very good soccer players," she said. "I'm happy that two of my Fairfield teammates as well as a couple of players and a coach from the program were chosen as well."


  Cluff-McDevitt played center midfield in high school at Notre Dame Academy of Hingham as well as at Fairfield. She described herself as not really a flashy player but she usually "found my way to get where I needed to be on the field. I got a lot of assists and I enjoyed putting the ball at the feet of my teammates."


  One of her favorite college memories found her as the one getting the goal. It was her freshman year in 1998 and Fairfield was locked in a double-overtime nail-biter with Loyola with the winner taking home the MAAC Championship. I'll let Cluff-McDevitt take the story from here.


  "I had a free kick from the top of the box, about 18 yards out and I scored the goal. Right foot to the top corner of the net," she said. "The amazing thing is I scored again the next year on a similar shot against the same team."


  Cluff-McDevitt said the time at NDA-Hingham was a large help in getting her ready for what would come at her down the road. "Notre Dame's a great school for academics with a very good soccer program. We put together some talented teams and played really strong teams. I think the entire package prepared me for what would come next (at Fairfield)."


  Cluff-McDevitt is second on Fairfield's list for career goals (36) and third in points (88). She won MAAC Player of the Year twice (1999, 2000) and was a three-time All-MAAC First Team selection. She was the MAAC Tournament MVP as a sophomore and helped her team to two conference titles and a pair of NCAA tournament appearances over her four years at the Connecticut college.


  She was inducted into Fairfield's Athletic Hall of Fame in 2011.


  "Those college years were an awesome time for me. I'd love to go back and experience it all again," Cluff-McDevitt said. "I had great teammates and coaches and an opportunity to see some of the world when the team traveled to New Zealand and Australia. A couple of my teammates were from New Zealand so were able to travel there and play against some club teams."


  Cluff-McDevitt owns a screen printing business in Kingston, Firefly Specialty Printing. With twin boys and a girl playing in the KYSA, soccer's still a big part of her life.


  "I love coaching the kids. It's a blast and it keeps me around the game. I still see a lot of familiar faces around the soccer field," Cluff-McDevitt said.

The dry and dusty village of Aziz Abad sits on the frontline of Afghanistan's war and is currently under government control -- but only just.
 Every night, 20-year-old paramilitary policeman Zainullah and his colleagues must seek refuge in filthy trenches at their battered outpost on the edge of the village while insurgents target them at an increasingly fierce tempo.
 "The Taliban do not want peace," said Zainullah, who like many Afghans only goes by one name.
 "They are detonating landmines, roadside bombs, sticky bombs and launching rocket attacks."
 The village is located in Maiwand district -- the scene of a notorious British military defeat in the 19th century -- in Kandahar province, where the insurgents have kept control in some rural areas despite 19 years of war.
 The insurgents are close to Zainullah's makeshift base, where barbed wire fencing and shredded sandbags offer scant protection.
 A walkie-talkie crackles as a police officer listens in on Taliban transmissions -- he says the militants are discussing the unrecognised vehicles AFP is travelling in.
 After months of US cajoling and concessions, the Taliban finally agreed to start peace talks with the Afghan government in September, but the Islamist hardliners have only stepped up attacks in the weeks since.
 "Lots of our colleagues have been killed and many others wounded," Zainullah said.
 In late September, Taliban fighters crossed the frontline, reaching a nearby village called Deh Qubat before being pushed back.
 "The Taliban were hiding behind walls, in houses and in the mosque. They were everywhere," recalled Atta Jan, a 28-year-old farmer, who was having breakfast when militants stormed his street in Deh Qubat, a 35-minute drive from Aziz Abad.
 Sardar, a farmer in Aziz Abad, said his mosque no longer offers evening prayers because of the volatile security situation.
 Walls in his village have been destroyed by fighting and the roads are all but abandoned.
 Separated by the war, some of Sardar's family live under the Taliban, divided by a no man's land of desert.
 "All our families are split... for the past 18 years I have not seen their happiness or sorrow, I have not attended their funerals," he said.
 \- Dwindling US support -
 The peace talks came after the Taliban and Washington signed a deal in February, with the US agreeing to withdraw all foreign forces in exchange for security guarantees and a Taliban promise to start talks.
 "Since the talks began, the fighting has intensified every day," said Ahmad Ikhlas, a police commander with hearing damage from a recent Taliban truck bombing.
 "One of our colleagues died in the explosion a couple of weeks ago. After the blast, I became deaf."
 Such scenes are playing out across Afghanistan, with the Taliban harassing Afghan army and police bases and launching large-scale attacks, including one on Lashkar Gah, the capital of neighbouring Helmand province.
 The US Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR) said in a report Thursday that overall attacks against Afghan forces and civilians were up 50 percent in the three months to the end of September, compared to the previous quarter.
 And where Afghan forces around Aziz Abad could once rely on US military support, now they must increasingly fend for themselves.
 "Now we don't get air support," grumbled Zainullah.
 President Donald Trump has said he wants US troops out of Afghanistan as quickly as possible, and the Pentagon has seemed reluctant to strike the Taliban, publicly acknowledging only a handful of strikes since February.
 So for many residents in Maiwand, which has seen constant violence since the Taliban's ouster following the US-led invasion of 2001, peace seems unimaginable.
 "The Taliban throw dust in the eyes of Americans -- they make some deal with them but do not want peace," said Khalil, a 26-year-old police officer who helped defend Deh Qubat.
 He said he has relatives fighting on both sides of the conflict, and many who have died because of it.
 Progress seen in other parts of the country since 2001 have hardly materialised in this unstable region. The first school for girls in Aziz Abad is still under construction.
 Many of the people AFP spoke to see no end to Taliban influence, and the insurgent group has made clear it expects to be back in power before long.
 Fourteen-year-old Malalai, who is already engaged, said she had missed her window to get an education.
 "If I start now, I will be too old when I graduate," she said.
 For teenage cousins Mohibullah and Rafiullah, living on the frontline village of Deh Qubat has meant a lifetime of fear.
 "Every night, there is fighting. My heart says peace will not come," Mohibullah said.

As COVID-19 cases surge across the country, Berks County is no exception.


  "We're seeing numbers closer to what we saw in May,” said Dr. Debra Powell, an infectious disease specialist at Reading Hospital.


  Powell says cases are on the upswing and so are hospitalizations.


  “It's starting to build, we still have availability in the hospital but we don't want to overwhelm our health system,” said Powell.


  State health officials reported 2900 new cases in Pennsylvania Thursday. The state's death toll stands at more than 8900, and with two new deaths in Berks County recorded, the local toll is now at 432.


  "We still have to continue to do what we've been saying all along, wearing your masks, socially distancing, etc. so I think it needs to be reinforced,” said Powell.


  Powell says that warning is especially important as we head into the holiday season.


  "I think it's going to be hard going through Thanksgiving and Christmas but we still have to advocate for our most vulnerable people, like the elderly."


  She's urging families to gather and celebrate safely.


  "As we're getting into the holidays again try to stay in a smaller setting, don't invite your entire family over for Thanksgiving,” said Powell.

A fellow Cold War vet called me a “Cold warrior” and I pointed out that I was only a flunky. So, who would qualify to be labeled a “warrior”?


  Would it be a Navy SEAL who served as a sniper from his hidden perch in the trees? Or would it be the draftee who crawled up a hill with bullets buzzing by? Is a pilot dropping bombs more of a warrior than the pilot flying reconnaissance missions? Is a pacifist medic who serves with the Army in heavy combat less courageous than the soldiers beside him? Is a tank driver less brave than the man who drives a jeep along a mine-infested road? In actual combat, is the guy knocked out by the percussion of a shell less worthy of praise than his buddy who charged forward and destroyed the enemy mortar crew?


  For every combat veteran, there are thousands of other military personnel doing the jobs they were ordered to do.


  A friend of mine served in Vietnam and spent the entire tour in an air- conditioned building doing clerk work. Should he not be proud of his service? Another friend of mine spent two years in the Navy and never went to sea.


  How can a man who serves on a sub be compared to one who puts a plane safely onto the deck of a swaying surface ship? Is the crew of a supply ship somehow of lesser value than the crew of a battleship that launches shells to a coast several miles away? Should the crews of the lone wolf ships Northampton and Wright be considered more heroic than the crews of the aircraft carriers which were heavily protected by escort ships? Were the officers aboard the Wright and Northampton who carried the code to launch nuclear weapons more important than the officers who sat deep in a bunker ready to press the button?


  Should a veteran of the Marine Corps be honored more than an Air Force vet? What is the difference between a friend of mine who served as a Marine Reservist with a few months of active duty and another Marine friend who completed several years with the regular forces?


  In May of 1968, there was a lot of combat in Vietnam. During the Battle of Kham Duc, over a dozen United Sates soldiers were killed. At nearly the same time, in the lonely North Atlantic, the submarine U.S.S. Scorpion was lost, killing 99 crew members while conducting surveillance of Russians. Which service members were the bravest?

New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern was sworn in for a second term Friday, as final election results showed her landslide victory was even bigger than previously thought.
 The charismatic leader and her ministers made their oaths of office in English and Maori during a ceremony at Wellington's Government House.
 "I would say simply that sitting at this table is Aotearoa New Zealand," Ardern said, gesturing to her gathered team, in which women and Maori are strongly represented.
 "They collectively represent a range of different perspectives, huge talent, enormous experience and, as you would expect in any time of crisis, a huge commitment to serving this country."
 Ardern, 40, leveraged her success battling Covid-19 into an unprecedented majority at the October 17 election, leading her centre-left Labour Party to its biggest win since World War II.
 Final results released Friday showed Ardern won 50.0 percent of the vote, up from 49.0 on election night, giving her 65 seats in the 120-strong parliament, rather than 64.
 The main opposition National Party saw its seats reduced from 35 to 33, prompting campaign director Gerry Brownlee to step down as deputy party leader.
 Ardern said she had a clear mandate for reform, although her priorities were containing Covid-19 and rebuilding the virus-damaged economy.
 \- 'Incrementalist' reform -
 The pandemic is one of a string of emergencies that tested Ardern's leadership during a torrid first term, after she rode to an unexpected victory in 2017 polls on the back of a wave of support dubbed "Jacinda-mania".
 She displayed both empathy and decisive action on gun control after a white supremacist gunman killed 51 Muslim worshippers in the Christchurch mosques attack last year.
 Ardern again found herself comforting a shocked nation when a volcanic eruption at White Island, also known as Whakaari, killed 21 people and left dozens more with horrific burns.
 While praised for her crisis management, Ardern was criticised during her first term for failing to deliver on key promises such as improving housing affordability, protecting the environment and reducing child poverty.
 Since the election, Ardern has signalled she wants reform, but not at a rate that would alienate the centrist voters who switched support to Labour in the poll.
 "We must make sure we represent all those who elected us, be they in city seats, rural seats, general seats or Maori seats," she told reporters Friday.
 She had flagged action on infrastructure projects including increased state housing and more renewable energy, as well as a determination to tackle issues such as climate change, poverty and inequality.
 Edward Elder, a teaching fellow specialising in political communication at the University of Auckland, said Ardern was likely to take an "incrementalist" approach to reform.
 "It really depends on what the Labour government thinks they can implement to create long-term change, rather than overreaching, facing a harsh backlash, and having National come in after 2023 and simply reversing all their decisions," he told AFP.

TROY -- Having scouted Clarkston Everest Collegiate at the team's regional final win, Lenawee Christian boys soccer coach Nate Sharpe felt that his team might need a quick strike to knock the Mountaineers off their game for Wednesday night's Division 4 state semifinal game at Troy Athens High School.
   
 Senior Scott Knoll delivered that strike in the second minute off of a throw in by Zeke Clymer, and Everest never was able to draw level again, as the Mountaineer offense was held off by the Cougars backline and senior goalkeeper Evan Hendershot en route to Lenawee Christian picking up the 2-0 victory.
   
 "It's awesome," said Knoll. "I never really thought we'd make it this far when I was a freshman, and I thought that if we were to make it, it would be the past two years when we had super good players then. I think it's awesome that we're able to make it this year because the main group of us seniors have been together all four years, and it's just awesome that we're able to make it because we're a solid team."
   
 The win pushes the Cougars, now sitting at 15-2-1 for the 2020 season, onto the state finals Saturday at Novi against the 19-0-2 squad from Grandville Calvin Christian, which won 3-0 over Leland in the earlier of Wednesday's semifinals over at Kentwood. It is the first time that the Lenawee Christian boys soccer team has made a state finals, having made it to the D4 semifinals back in 1999 but suffering a 2-1 loss in overtime against Grosse Points Woods University Liggett.
   
 "It's amazing," said Sharpe. "It's hard to find someone who says they played in the last game. Not the last game of the season, because the season's over, but the very last game, and that's what we've been pushing for all week."
   
 Hendershot had to make a series of saves while the Cougars were holding onto a 1-0 lead, finishing with a five-save shutout that was aided in a big way by his backs in front of him that helped contain Everest's surge, while Knoll and Brennan Griffith added the tallies offensively for Lenawee Christian.
   
 The game was barely 90 seconds old when Clymer threw the ball from the left sideline into the box, and Knoll battled through some contact in close to get his foot on the ball and score what would prove to be the game-winning tally for LCS.
   
 "The last three games we've had quick starts, magic starts," said Sharpe. "Zeke's been throwing and chucking that ball all season, and I think that caught (Everest) off guard a little bit, and Scotty did a great job, his finishing has improved in the last few weeks, and he put it right where it needed to be."
   
 The LCS defense pinned down Everest's attack early, not allowing a shot until the 17th minute of the contest and had a pair of chances, one from Jacob McKelvey and one off a Clymer header that the Mountaineers were able to turn away.
   
 Slowly, despite being in the lead, the momentum turned away from the Cougars, as Everest Collegiate (10-6-2) got the momentum with shots from Lucas Cross and Jake Jackson having to be turned away by Hendershot with the ball in the LCS half for long stretches, but despite those chances and a free kick in the final few minutes that the defense had to clear away, LCS held the one-goal lead at halftime.
   
 Everest's Joey Thibodeau opened the half with a shot in on Hendershot that the Cougars' senior had to turn aside, and Cross followed that with a shot in the 52nd minute that had to be turned away as well.
   
 Just a few minutes later, the Cougars got a golden opportunity when senior Gabe Henley drove into the box and was fouled, being knocked to the ground and getting LCS a penalty shot. Griffith stepped forward to take it, and despite the goalie diving the correct direction and getting a piece of the ball, his shot got home to put the Cougars up two with 25 minutes to go.
   
 LCS had regained the momentum in that instant, and were able to control the play for most of the remaining time on the clock, with Henley, Griffith and Clymer each getting shots on net to help keep the Mountaineers from getting any offense going and securing the Cougars a spot in their first state final.

Their decision continues a rather remarkable pattern of how an almost fact- free narrative of American black ‘genocide’ – to quote prominent attorney Benjamin Crump – is sustained by selective dishonesty and plain old-fashioned censorship on the part of ‘allies’ of the black community. Even today, a majority of black Americans believe that St Louis area teenager Brown was essentially murdered by Ferguson (Missouri) police officer Darren Wilson, in a scenario close to that originally described to the media by ‘street witnesses’. That is, a black boy was shot in cold blood as he held up his open hands and begged for his life. However, while this scenario inspired the popular t-shirt and political slogan ‘Hands up, don’t shoot’, it bears little resemblance to reality.

In a state which is likely going to come down to the wire, a mandatory recount must be completed three weeks after the election, meaning that we may have to wait until late November to know who won Pennsylvania — and therefore, who won the election.

Very rarely, a seasonal Blue Moon (third of four full moons in one season) and a monthly Blue Moon (second of two full moons in one calendar month) can occur in the same calendar year. For this to happen, you need 13 full moons between successive December solstices for a seasonal Blue Moon – and, generally, 13 full moons in one calendar year for a monthly Blue Moon.


  This will next happen in the year 2048, when a monthly Blue Moon falls on January 31, and a seasonal Blue Moon on August 23.


  I have heard friends who are either in the professions of healthcare of bartending say that full moon evenings can be interesting at work. Lucky for my friends, most will be retired by 2048.


  Someday, you might see a true blue-colored moon in the sky. Blue-colored moons are rare – aren’t necessarily full – and happen when Earth’s atmosphere contains dust or smoke particles of a certain size, slightly wider than 900 nanometers. Particles of this size are very efficient at scattering red light. When these particles are present in our air, and the moon shines through them, the moon may appear blue in color.


  By the way, Toby Keith wasn’t the only hit-maker to have success using the term Blue Moon. In 1961, the Marcels had success with their catchy ditty, “Blue Moon.”


  Many artists covered the version including Frank Sinatra, Elvis Presley and Billie Holiday, but in 2004 Rod Stewart is the only one to sing Blue Moon exactly as Richard Rogers and Lorenz Hart wrote it complete with the introduction.


  Another highly covered hit was “Blue Moon of Kentucky” written in 1945 by musician Bill Monroe and recorded by his band, the Blue Grass Boys.


  In 2002, Monroe’s version was one of 50 recordings chosen that year by the Library of Congress to be added to the National Recording Registry.

Breaching the Snake River dams won't necessarily improve the survival rate of chinook salmon, because returns of the fish appear to be similar everywhere, including areas with pristine freshwater habitats, a new study finds.
 "Current efforts to conserve salmon populations assume that restoring habitats modified by anthropogenic factors — e.g. dams, dikes, forestry, road culverts, salmon farms in the coastal ocean — will improve salmon returns and at least partially compensate for worsening ocean conditions," the study says.
 "However, if survival also falls by roughly the same amount in regions with nearly pristine freshwater habitats, it is difficult to argue for a major role of regional factors in causing the decline," it says.
 The study was published Oct. 30 in the scientific journal Fish and Fisheries.
 All chinook populations are likely being similarly affected during their time in the ocean, because it is a shared environment, author David Welch told the Capital Press.
 "There are still some big puzzles here, because so little research has gone on in the ocean," Welch said. "For example, we still don’t know how salmon migrate through the ocean or whether different populations of the same species migrate to the same area of the ocean."
 Welch is president of Kintama Research Services, a marine environmental consultancy in Nanaimo, British Columbia.
 Commercial catch data show various salmon populations are caught in different regions of the ocean, but researchers have no idea how they migrated there or how long or where they take up residence during their two to three years in the ocean, Welch said.
 Possible reasons for poor marine survival are likely multiple, the study finds, with theories including growth, hatchery practices, predation, competition, by-catch mortality in fisheries and ocean conditions.
 The theory that the dams result in poorer survival of Snake River spring chinook relative to mid-Columbia chinook populations after smolts migrate past the dams is specific to the Columbia River Basin, the article states.
 The theory still plays an important role in Columbia River salmon management, but direct tests of the theory have not found evidence to support it.
 The decline of West Coast chinooks is still cause for concern, Welch said.
 "With the path many salmon populations are on, in terms of falling marine survival, they may well be headed for extinction," he said. "This will cause all sorts of chaos because, especially in the U.S., it is against the law — the Endangered Species Act — to allow them to go extinct."
 Bureaucratic and legal systems may not be set up to deal with a situation where key unknown problems are out at sea, while institutional structures are set up to largely respond by calling for more and more extreme responses in freshwater, he said.
 Welch compared the situation to a doctor arguing for expanding a patient's lung capacity, when the patient has liver cancer. The expanded lung capacity doesn't address the cancer, he said.
 "The situation with salmon is that we have a lot of people trying to 'fix' possible problems in freshwater that they have identified as being poor," Welch said. "However, it is not at all clear that freshwater conditions can be improved anywhere near enough to compensate for the poor and still-worsening survival at sea."
 Welch recommends chinook salmon advocates support efforts to get to the root cause of the problems. They should insist on "rigorous evaluation" of proposed fixes to make sure they are actually going to be effective, he said.
 The paper collated almost 2,300 years of survival estimates for chinook salmon, Welch said. Similarly extensive monitoring programs are going on for coho and steelhead, with other, less extensive monitoring programs for sockeye, pink and chum salmon, Welch said.
 "The big question is why, with all this monitoring effort, has no one yet pointed out that survival was similar everywhere to what was reported for the Snake River?" he asked. "The data is all publicly available; it just took a lot of work to pull it all together and show the obvious."
 Estimates of the survival of tagged adults returning to the Columbia River failed to recognize that harvest in fisheries was large and variable, which Welch considers "catastrophic" to those estimates.
 "It raises the broader question of whether the advocates for extreme measures like dam breaching just have blinders on and can’t really see what is going on," he said.

NEW YORK - While Donald Trump's political allies remained silent or distanced themselves Thursday from the US president, increasingly alone in his fight against what he says is widespread election "fraud", his oldest sons declared their filial loyalty.


  Donald Trump Jr., the eldest, called on his father in a tweet to wage "total war" against the cheating that he believes is tainting the presidential election.


  The inflammatory tweet was framed by some, including the New York Post, as a clear sign of growing panic in the Trump camp over Joe Biden's chances of winning the White House.


  "The best thing for America's future is for @realDonaldTrump to go to total war over this election to expose all of the fraud, cheating, dead/no longer in state voters, that has been going on for far too long," Don Jr. wrote on his Twitter account, where he regularly retweets conspiracy theories.


  He did not provide any evidence of the cheating he alleged was going on.


  "It's time to clean up this mess & stop looking like a banana republic!" he added, before deriding the "total lack of action" from Republicans, naming some - such as South Carolina senator Lindsey Graham, usually a staunch Trump ally.


  His younger brother Eric also targeted the party that his father theoretically heads.


  "Where are Republicans! Have some backbone. Fight against this fraud. Our voters will never forget you if your sheep!" he wrote.


  Few, however, appeared to answer his grammatically incorrect call.


  Trump's eldest daughter and one of his senior advisers, Ivanka, tweeted Thursday that her father "will always go to the mat fighting for the hardworking men & women of this great Country!"


  But she has not tweeted or retweeted any of the fraud allegations championed by her brothers since Election Day.

It finally happened. Three federal agencies moved away from the federal mothership in Washington, D.C., and, despite all of the dire predictions, they appear to be getting along just fine in their new homes.
 The Bureau of Land Management moved 27 of its top people to Grand Junction, Colo., earlier this year. About 61 will remain in Washington, D.C., and the rest of the 360 employees will move to BLM’s regional offices around the West, where the agency manages 247.3 million acres of federal land.
 The USDA’s Economic Research Service and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture have also been unpacking boxes. Both agencies moved from Washington, D.C., to Kansas City, Mo.
 Of the 329 ERS positions, 76 were left behind in D.C. Of NIFA’s 344 positions, 21 stayed.
 When the Trump administration decided to move the agencies, the reaction many taxpayers had was that it was about time. Washington, D.C., has become a black hole where taxpayer money — and the power that goes with it — is concentrated to a toxic level. Ag groups and citizens spend thousands of dollars flying to Washington just to get a chance to talk to the decision-makers there.
 The fact that most U.S. agriculture and federal land are west of the Mississippi River means those decision-makers were far removed from the people and places their decisions impacted.
 The irony of the debate that the moves provoked was fascinating to those of us who call the West home.
 Critics made it sound as though Grand Junction was on the moon. Not quite. Situated at the confluence of the Colorado and Gunnison rivers and surrounded by mesas, orchards and vineyards, there aren’t many more beautiful spots in the West.
 Similarly, Kansas City has a well-deserved reputation as a thriving metropolis. It’s not Washington, D.C., but that’s a good thing when the costs of living are compared.
 Everything is more expensive in Washington. The cost of living in Kansas City is 35.9% lower than in Washington, D.C., according to the website bankrate.com.
 The moves were not easy for ERS and NIFA, but the outcomes appear to be worth it. The work is getting done, and the payrolls are leaner, meaning taxpayers also get a break.
 It’s easy to understand the institutional resistance to change. But considering the positives and negatives, the moves west were worth it.
 We’re pleased the administration followed through on its plans and hope that the rest of USDA and other agencies will also plan their escapes from D.C.

A week of rain spoiled crops, washed away bridges and flooded homes across Central America. Hurricane Eta’s arrival Tuesday afternoon in northeast Nicaragua followed days of drenching rain as it crawled toward shore. Its slow, meandering path north through Honduras pushed rivers over their banks and pouring into neighborhoods where families were forced onto rooftops to wait for rescue.


  Marta Julia Portillo, 62, fled her San Pedro Sula neighborhood before dawn Thursday with relatives. They paused at a gas station on dry ground until they were told to move on.


  “We don’t know where to go because we don’t have any place to shelter,” she said. Her son, who stayed behind at the family home, told her water was up to the third floor.


  “I would say the national capacity has been overwhelmed by the size of the impact we are seeing,” said Maite Matheu, Honduras director for the international humanitarian organization CARE. The group was using its network of contacts in Honduras to identify the hardest-hit areas and catalogue their most-pressing needs.


  Honduras Foreign Affairs minister Lisandro Rosales said via Twitter that “the destruction that Eta leaves us is enormous and public finances are at a critical moment because of COVID-19, we make a call to the international community to accelerate the process of recovery and reconstruction.”


  Observers are already anticipating that the havoc wrought by Eta will pressure more people to migrate from countries that are already some of the primary senders of migrants to the United States border in recent years.


  “Now with this situation, this is going to be an exodus, a massive exodus of migrants toward the north,” said Matheu.


  Late Thursday, Tropical Depression Eta had maximum sustained winds of 35 mph (55 kph) and was moving north at 8 mph (13 kph). The forecast had it strengthening to a tropical storm before nearing the Cayman Islands Saturday and crossing Cuba Sunday. From there it could reach Florida or at least come close enough to assure heavy rains.


  “Whatever comes out (of Central America) is going to linger awhile,” said Colorado State University hurricane researcher Phil Klotzbach. “I’m not convinced we’re done with Eta.”


  That’s because what’s left of Eta still has spin, which is hard to kill off, and that should help it reform, said NOAA hurricane and climate scientist Jim Kossin.


  Once it reforms and heads toward Cuba, it could meander in the area for awhile.


  “The winds aren’t going to be the problem. The rains are going to be the problem,” Klotzbach said.


  Eta will be so big, wet and messy that it doesn’t have to make landfall in already rain-soaked South Florida to cause a mess, Klotzbach said.


  “Slow-moving sprawling ugly tropical storms can certainly pack a precipitation wallop even if it doesn’t make landfall,” Klotzbach said.

Leading into the meeting, Ashley Bradshaw, a mother with children in the Blackfoot district, asked to speak during the open forum to the trustees regarding her family’s experience during a required quarantine due to exposure. Bradshaw did not sugar coat what she had to say; she stated that it caused her children to fall behind in their classes and it took them an additional two weeks after returning to the classroom to get caught up to their fellow classmates.


  She said that it was a lucky situation that she is able to stay home, but it could have been worse had she not been able to be there and try to be the interim teacher. She stated that she hopes the board understands the impact that the start of this school year has had on the students and how hard it is on parents to keep making arrangements or adjustments to be able to be home when their kids have to be home.


  Bradshaw finished her three minutes with stating, “Keep these kids in school.” After Bradshaw spoke, Superintendent Brian Kress went into his recommendation for the risk level for the district.


  Kress prefaced his recommendation to the board with a thank you to the parents for doing all they can in order to keep active COVID cases out of the district and read a letter from a parent. In the letter, the person had praised the district for taking the precautions they have, but are concerned about the impacts on the students’ education with all of the changes during the first semester (and trimester). Following the letter, Kress made his recommendation to the board to keep the district in the moderate-risk category despite the county moving up.


  His reasoning for keeping the district in the moderate level came down to the limited amount of exposure to the virus in the district and he felt how divided the Board of Health was proved indicative that the one-size-fits-all plan is not the only answer. Kress also stated that some of the schools in the district would be considered in the minimal-risk category if they were in their own district because they have not had issues with COVID in their schools.


  Adding into his recommendations were developmental collection days and evaluating the criterion being used to decide what constitutes changes in the district or if they should do it school by school. Through that recommendation, Kress stated that he thinks following one of the neighboring districts’ plan and modeling it but was not ready to present that to the board because he wanted to get their input on the current situation and he wanted to confirm with the neighboring district about their plan.

The India-US defence and counter-terror cooperation will remain intact and is likely to develop further in the face of a common threat of a rising China, flexing its muscles across Asia. Successive US governments, whether Republican or Democratic have realised India's centrality in the defence architecture of the Indo-Pacific region, where China is increasingly asserting its economic and military power. As a large democratic Asian nation, India fits the bill to counter an authoritarian China with its one-party rule.  Since Bill Clinton travelled to India in 2000, ties between India and the US has steadily progressed. One reason why Republican President  George Bush pushed for the India-US civil nuclear agreement was to get India on board to counter China.

BROCKTON -- Typically, when the last name Colombo is mentioned in Brockton circles, it's about the legendary Boxers football coach and others from the Italian family who were known for their exploits on the gridiron.
 But for Jack Colombo, sports was never his forte, instead applying his creative skills in the field of music.
 Jack Colombo, 61, recalled going to a physical education class in high school led by his father's cousin, Armond Colombo, the late, renowned Brockton High School coach whose football teams won nine Eastern Mass. Division 1 Super Bowl championships.
 "I went to gym and Armond used to say, 'Go to the Fine Arts Building,'" Jack Colombo said. "My claim to fame is I'm the only Colombo who existed with no athletic ability."

 Colombo, a full-time musician and lifelong Brocktonian, was named a KORG USA- endorsed artist this year, as the keyboard company recognizes him for a career of accomplishments, including performances with 140 different acts with top 50 hit songs.
 Colombo, as a multi-keyboard performer, pianist, arranger and producer, has played with award-winning groups like The Drifters, featuring Charlie Thomas, serving as the group's music director for 23 years. He's also played concerts around the country and arranged music for The Lettermen, Al Jardine of The Beach Boys, The O'Jays, Bowzer of Sha Na Na, Ben E. King, Mary Wilson of The Supremes, The Manhattan Transfer and many others.
 Colombo is joining a long list of KORG artists that is highlighted by legends of the music industry like Phil Collins and Herbie Hancock.
 "I'm in good company," said Colombo, speaking recently by phone. "I'm humbly happy about it. It's a godsend. The opportunity doesn't come along people's way a lot. The keyboards are difficult endorsements. The products are a lot of money. It's different than drumsticks or guitar sponsorships. Those are more easy to come by."
 Colombo is founder, co-owner and an instructor at the Southeast School of Music in Easton.
 And Colombo has directed oldies music specials for PBS, made music for television commercials, served as music director for a Boston City Hall Plaza concert series, directed ballet pop concern series, provided a soundtrack for a Pittsburgh Steelers pre-game show, orchestrated a private Super Bowl celebration for the New England Patriots, directed music for the Catholic Tri- Parishes of Brockton and led national artist shows for Caribbean and Alaskan cruise companies. He also worked for the Vocal Group Hall of Fame as a musical director for three years. And he put together the The Drifters vocalists reunion in 2005 that aired on PBS.
 Colombo has shared his love of music with his daughter, Tori Colombo, a seventh grader at West Middle School, who has joined him on stage, including once with The Drifters playing percussion at just nine years old in 2017 at Stadium Theatre in Woonsocket, Rhode Island. Jack Colombo said he started playing organ and piano at age 9, first playing professionally as a 16-year- old at local function halls and family parties, calling the rock organ his "first love."
 "It was really cool as a dad to see her on stage," Colombo said. "And it was really cool for them, too. She was the youngest person to ever perform with The Drifters. It was awesome."
 Colombo said his daughter also brought her percussion rig on stage to join him and Bowzer from Sha Na NA in front of an audience of 16,000 people at the Mohegan Sun Arena in Connecticut during an oldies rock concert in 2018.
 "I think it is crazy to have a dad that has played in front of thousands of people," Tori Colombo said, during a break from remote learning classes, congratulating her father on the Korg artist endorsement. "I'm really happy. He always works hard no matter what. I'm glad this happened for him. It's amazing how he gets recognized everywhere and how he's so talented on the piano. It really is a blessing to have a dad that amazing."
 Colombo said another cool moment in his career was when he was complimented by singer and songwriter Paul Simon, who was in the audience for a 60s music show headlined by The Drifters at the Bergen Performing Arts Center in New Jersey around five years ago or so.
 "I was in disbelief," said Colombo, adding that he would have been a lot more nervous performing had he known Simon was in the crowd. "He said, 'You know, I'm not a fan of four-piece groups, but you guys really pulled it off and it sounded amazing.' I thought that was an awesome compliment."
 When Colombo became a musical director for the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 2002, it opened up a new world for him, as he began to work with great singers, musicians and nationally renowned bands who made so many top hit songs.
 "I played with like 18 groups the first time around who had top hits, including Mary Wilson, The Manhattan Transfer and Al Jardine," Colombo said. "That kind of opened up that whole world and got me really involved in that circuit. Then everything became wide open. The floodgates opened up."

At a couple of junctures participants in the zoom session who are critical of OSU’s forest management approach offered to buy the forest from the state.

 And if things don’t work out the state could take the forest back and run it in a different fashion, noted Randall Rosenberger, associate dean of OSU’s College of Forestry.
 Ryan admitted the timetable for the project was a bit accelerated.

Per Colorado state law a recount is triggered when the difference between the high and low count is equal to or less than 0.5% of the higher vote count. In this case, that's a margin of 7,129 votes, The Colorado Sun reported.
 The initiative would be the first time in the United States that voters, not wildlife officials, approved the reintroduction of wolves. The vote in Colorado has, so far, broken along rural/urban lines, the Colorado Sun reports.

Some members of the group posted about civil war and revolting against the government should Trump lose the election, according to a report by the Institute for Strategic Dialogue (ISD), a London-based think tank that monitors extremism.
 "So IF they give this to Joe, how do we go about over throwing [sic] the government?" one member of the group asked in a post.
 Ciaran O'Connor, an analyst with ISD, said that, although such posts may be hyperbolic, Facebook groups can be used to coordinate offline protests or events that could turn violent.
 "It was possible for this group to become a hub for potentially violent behavior," O'Connor said.
 One of the administrators of the "Stop the Steal" group, Dustin Stockton, told CNN he did not see any messages within the group "calling for violence outside of what is common political hyperbole." He said Facebook's removal of the page was "out of line and they should restore it immediately."
 A Facebook spokesperson told CNN, "In line with the exceptional measures that we are taking during this period of heightened tension, we have removed the Group 'Stop the Steal,' which was creating real-world events."
 The spokesperson added, "The group was organized around the delegitimization of the election process, and we saw worrying calls for violence from some members of the group."
 Researchers say the controversy over the vote count is particularly fertile soil for extremists to spread their messages.
 "A contested election creates the perfect conditions for extremists to create chaos, to sow division, and to try to undermine our democratic institutions," said Oren Segal, a vice president of the ADL's Center on Extremism. "All those are foundational goals for extremist movements across the board."
 Even if comments from political influencers do not directly call for violence, war-like symbols and veiled references can valorize violence and potentially inspire people to action, said Cynthia Miller-Idriss, director of the Polarization and Extremism Research and Innovation Lab at American University.
 She said President Trump's comments at his first debate with Biden, in which he told the far-right group the Proud Boys to "stand back and stand by," for instance, could have been perceived as a call to action, regardless of his intent.
