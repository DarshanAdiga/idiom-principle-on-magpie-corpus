I once got told off by a friend of mine who’s a police officer for my bad habit of dumping my handbag, with keys inside, on the side table next to the door as soon as I got home. She told me it was the first place a potential thief would look.
 This week RACQ released new insurance figures showing car theft was on the rise and May was the second most common month, behind December, for your car to be stolen.
 While opportunistic thieves can strike at any time, there are some simple steps we can take to reduce the risk.
 Treat your keys like cash, keep them out of sight, never leave them in the ignition and never leave them next to the front door. Most vehicles are stolen from the driveway or the street in front of owner’s home, and often stolen using the owner’s keys. So if possible keep your car locked in a garage, or inside a secure fence to add another layer of protection.
 No one wants to be the victim of theft, especially when it can be avoidable. The key to safety can be as simple as changing your habits.

The singer said that at the moment she is committed to writing "uplifting, inspirational anthems" like Daisies. "I wrote this song just like it's another anthem for myself. I came out of a pretty dark time on Witness and I've been writing a record for two years. I wrote some of it while I was clinically depressed and trying to find the light at the end of the tunnel. And when I'm writing songs like Firework or Roar, it's not because I'm feeling hunky dory," said the singer.

We know that the plans for now are to premiere _Supergirl_ season 6, but you are going to have to wait longer than most other shows on the network. Benoist is currently expecting her first child, and production will likely start after she has a maternity leave. Our hope is that it can be back when we get around to the spring of 2021, but a lot of that is going to depend heavily on when things are safe for productions elsewhere. For the time being, that remains the most important thing in the world and it transcends beyond just some television productions.

Foley responded by saying it was one of the nicest things anyone had ever said about him. In an interview with ComicBook (while promoting the WWE Network documentary series _Undertaker: The Last Ride_ ) this week, Foley gave his thoughts on that entire interaction.
 "I got teary eyed, I really did," Foley said. "It's funny because the bigger she got, the more credit she would give to me, although I actually did nothing, except I guess inspire her when she was younger."
 In an interview with _PEOPLE Magazine_ shortly after her announcement, Lynch revealed that her due date was set for December and that she had only learned about her pregnancy in April (she hadn't wrestled since _WrestleMania 36_ against Shayna Baszler). She also talked about how she always dreamed of being a mother and looks forward to raising a child alongside her fiancee Seth Rollins.

 "I've always, always wanted kids," Lynch said, adding that her due date is in December. "I'm just so career-focused that it became one of those things that, when you're chasing a dream for so long, I always wondered, 'Am I going to get around to it? Is it going to happen for me?'"
 "When we got together, things started to look a lot clearer and I knew he was the person that I wanted to have kids with -- that this was going to happen and it was just a matter of when," she later added. "Seth is one of the smartest people I know," the star, who is originally from Ireland, says of her fiance. "He's just got an insane work ethic, insane integrity and he is the most generous, kindhearted person. He's very, very focused on what the right thing to do is and always looking to grow and correct himself and be better so he can be the best person for me, and now, the best father," she continues."

Tiger Town Pizza completely shut their doors on April 1 and weren't able to open them again until almost a month later on April 25. Even now, they are only doing carry-out orders in the evenings as many of their staff members don't feel safe to return to work and they haven't been able to hire any new workers.
   
 "When we had to shut down there was that fear of when will we be able to reopen again or will we be able to reopen at all? That was very scary for all of our employees," Ashley Haney, the restaurant's manager said.
   
 As the restaurant was created by high school students in their Applied Business class, the staff is mostly made up of high school students as a way to give back to them. Haney explained that although it hit the adult staff the hardest (the kitchen manager won't be able to work until next week and she has bills to pay), she knows that some of the students also have to pay for their own food and even have bills of their own to pay.
   
 "It was really hard for me to make the decision because I know how much we do for the community and how much this job means to those high school students," Haney said.
   
 The restaurant is community-oriented and they are always working to give back to the community in creative ways. Since Haney took over last September, she has worked to make Tiger Town a fun space for everyone. They have a partnership with the school so when kids meet their AR (Accelerated Reader) point goals, they get a free personal pan at Tiger Town. They had a full photo booth around Halloween, a candy cane tree around Christmas, and hearts with every kids name that ate there filled the walls around Valentine's Day. She also had decorating plans for Easter but those went out the window when COVID-19 hit.
   
 When they were able to open for carry-out only, the community showed how much they truly care about their neighborhood pizza place.
   
 "That first day we opened, we brought in a record number of sales. That night was about the 5th highest amount we brought in since we've been open for the past two years. It's great to have that kind of support from the town to know they are also working to keep us in business."
   
 The staff that has been able to return is taking as many precautions as possible to keep themselves and their customers safe. All staff are required to wear masks and the kitchen staff wear gloves at all times. No customers are allowed to come inside the restaurant, the workers will meet them on the curb to take their money and give them their food and change.
   
 At this point, everything is still touch and go and Haney is not sure when they will be able to open their regular dining area to costumers. She is shooting for June, but even then she's not sure how much it will help.
   
 "We already have a small dining area so even when we can open up, if we still have to keep social distancing, we can only seat about 7 of our 13 tables."
   
 Until then, with the launch of their soft reopening and their community's support, Tiger Town has been able to stay afloat. However, they have not yet received any monetary assistance from the government. The federal government passed a bill that promised about 350 billion dollars to rescue small businesses. Tiger Town has applied and been approved, but they are still waiting for more information as to how much money they will receive, when they will get it, and how they are supposed to spend it.
   
 Community support continues to help them stay in business.

It is unfortunate that Telangana with its widespread network of chilling centres fails to meet even 50% of the State’s requirements. Some of the chilling centres, which are a stone’s throw from Hyderabad, have become monuments of apathy. The only noteworthy thing about them is their appreciation in real estate value. Kadthal and Shadnagar once had a peak procurement of 40,000 litres per day. Similarly, Bhongir, Chityal, Choutuppal and Gajwel are now out of sight and out of mind.
