  # Grizzly shot after injuring father, son hunting in northern Montana


  Associated Press


  KALISPELL, Mont. (AP) — A grizzly bear attacked and injured a father and son hunting in northern Montana.


  The bear charged out of a thickly wooded area and attacked the two on a road Saturday near Smith Lake north of Whitefish Lake in the Flathead Valley, according to Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks.


  The hunters shot and killed the bear and were later flown to a hospital. Authorities didn't identify the two or say how seriously they were hurt.


  Investigators found a deer carcass and concluded the nearly 20-year-old female was defending the food and offspring, the Helena Independent Record reported.
