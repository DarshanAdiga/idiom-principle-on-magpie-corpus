Hello Games still isn't done with _No Man 's Sky_. Today, the developer has announced and released Desolation, a free update that adds scary freighters to explore. The innards of each ship will be procedurally generated, ensuring that no expedition is quite the same. They'll be filled with ship logs and personal possessions which explain what happened to the crew on board. In the end, you should also gain access to a captain's log that breaks down the final hours.
 Navigating the freighters will be challenging, though. You might find that the lights have been switched off, or that the vessel's gravity and life support systems have gone haywire. Some will have rogue AI systems, too, and "biological horror" that doesn't like trespassers.

There are several services and tools to accomplish this, and you may even already be using them. Travis-CI is one of the most prevalent services in the open-source community because the service is free for open-source projects. CircleCI is another similar service featuring a free tier and several advanced paid features such as autoscaling and access to faster clusters. GitLab also has a service and makes it easy to get up and running on your systems. You could also be using something like Jenkins or TeamCity to accomplish similar tasks of building and testing your application. While there is nothing wrong with these services, I was curious about GitHub’s offering since I’m already using GitHub for 90% of my projects. I’m also excited by the idea I could remove the dependency on one of the several third-party applications I depend on. Even if you use a service other than GitHub, the concepts and steps required are likely similar to what I set up.

The effect of pesticide use on human health is a problem that has received attention from the scientific community worldwide, especially in central countries, where the highest number of deaths due to human exposure to these agents is observed. Production and productivity increased through the progress of agro-industrialization, but risks to the environment and health were not taken into account. Over time, several cases of environmental contamination and public health problems, poisoning of rural workers, and food residues were observed. These factors triggered the recognition of risks arising from pesticide abuse. This study aimed to characterize pesticide poisonings reported to a toxicological information center of the state of Goiás through a retrospective analysis from 2005 to 2015. Data were mapped and tabulated by the purpose of pesticides, the circumstance of poisoning, and case development. The poisoning profile pointed to a higher occurrence of work- and suicide-related poisonings, with a predominance of poisoned patients, although chronic effects were not recorded, suggesting a false diagnosis of cure.

Example applications are all fun and games until you try to apply these ideas to a real-world application. I can share a real-world use of GitHub Actions for the Joind.in API, an open-source API project which powers the event speaker feedback site Joind.in. For the sake of transparency, I am one of the Joindin project maintainers, and I worked with Andreas Möller who converted the Travis-CI workflow to GitHub Actions. The pull request Andreas did was my first exposure with GitHub Actions, and it was a pleasant experience from the maintainer side of the project. Once we were comfortable with the workflows, it became just as invaluable as our Travis-CI configuration. Now we (Joindin) have removed that third-party process from the project, so there is one less place to have to visit to find information.

East Chicago Fire Chief Anthony Serna cited the partnership that resulted in Gary and East Chicago firefighter candidates undergoing five months of training in both cities, including the new Gary station.
 “Welcome to the family,” Serna said. “The fire service is a family. You have a heart to serve.”
 Gary Fire Chief Sean O’Donnell challenged the graduates to “never dishonor the oath of office or tarnish the badge.
 “The people of the city of Gary are our customers. That’s who we serve. Never forget that. That’s why they call 911. We’re there when they need us.”

Put simply, this is another example of the dynamic that has made this entire process of pro football in a pandemic so vexing. Every answer leads to even more questions. At the end of the day, the league, the teams, and the players will have to accept the fact that abuses may occur, whether it's a veteran threatening to opt out in order to get a better contract, an undrafted rookie pocketing $150,000 he never would have earned, or a team taking full advantage of ultra-flexible IR/NFI/COVID-19 rules to stash as many players as possible.

The measure would give cash stipends to Americans, and bolster rental and mortgage and other safety net protections.

Rodney Vezmar transforms a “difficult stick” into a relieved patient by combining his medical experience, education, and love for what he does best.
 The tension in the room has increased, and the nervousness is now irritation. Family is upset, the patient is afraid and usually in pain.
 In strides the 59-year-old. He pulls up the waste can, sits down next to the patient, and shares a smile as big as sunshine.
 While he chats, he flawlessly inserts the troublesome IV in less than 1 minute and asks the patient why they’re visiting Community Hospital. Within two minutes, the IV has started, the tension is gone, and the patient is talking.
 Just another day in the life of Nurse Rodney Vezmar, IV Therapy specialist and one of Community’s most valuable health care professionals.
 “I’m doing what I was meant to do,” he said. “I love helping people, and I’ve been blessed to find the best way to help them through health care.”
 Any medical professional with hospital experience knows how crucial peripheral IV access can be. Getting fluids and medications into a critically ill or injured patient can make or break the effectiveness of their treatment.
 At best, a difficult stick — a patient whose veins make inserting a needle difficult — presents a problem that can involve multiple pricks with increasing pain on each attempt, frustrated and flustered medical staff, and a delay in treatment. At worst, a difficult stick can increase medical complications.
 As a member of Community’s specialized IV team, Vezmar is one of the best. He gets requests for his skill set daily. “It’s an art that can’t be taught by a book,” he said. “I have a knack acquired through experience.”
 Vezmar has been at Community for 23 years, doing tours of duty in ER, Cath Lab Recovery, and now IV Therapy. He came up old-school, working while going to college for his nurse’s degree. He had determination, and a wife who provided the best support possible.
 “He has such a passion for his patients,” Lilly Vezmar said. “If I was a patient, I’d want Rodney to be my IV specialist. The health care field is hard, but he manages to find sunshine and share it with those he treats every day.”
 Vezmar remains humble about his talents, which bring him respect from his peers. His patients provide rave reviews about his unique abilities, and his wife remains amazed by his energy and compassion.
 “He has such a thirst for knowledge,” she said. “He always has his nose in a book.”
 Vezmar plays the guitar and spent many years as part of a band with family members that included his father. He and Lilly have two children, one getting married this year. He has no plans to retire yet, and patients across Northwest Indiana are grateful.

Our primary focus is to configure GitHub Actions to install our dependencies and run our tests. If everything passes, we should allow merging the pull request. We should also ensure we’re testing different versions of PHP to ensure compatibility. Since this is a library which others can use, we should support as many versions as possible to allow flexibility to our potential users. My own rule of thumb is to try to support all PHP versions that are still supported by PHP.net. We can also find and use workflows created by others via the GitHub Marketplace where there are currently 43 Actions matching a search query for `"PHP"`. We can start with these user-contributed workflows or build our own via the Workflow Editor. The Workflow Editor is the web-based configuration tool for GitHub Actions.

You might find that the lights have been switched off, or that the vessel's gravity and life support systems have gone haywire. Some will have rogue AI systems, too, and "biological horror" that doesn't like trespassers. You can take on these gauntlets solo or with a bunch of friends. Hello Games introduced cross-play last month, which means you can play with anyone on PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC. No Man's Sky was updated with VR support last year, too, if you really want to immerse yourself in the role of a scavenger.Abandoned freighters will also contain items that you can use to beef up your own cargo-hauling starship. They'll somehow "reflect the history of ships you've scavenged," ensuring you never forget that time your best friend was trapped in a room with five alien nests.Desolation, contains a host of smaller upgrades, too, such as better bloom lighting and lens flare, rebalanced combat, unique player titles and new missions at the Nexus on the Space Anomaly.The free patch is the latest chapter in No Man's Sky's remarkable comeback story. The game underwhelmed at launch, in no small part to the dizzying expectations that the developer and its marketing materials failed to quash. The studio has stuck with the title, though, and delivered numerous updates that have won back community support and, in the eyes of many, realised the vision that was promised so many years ago.
