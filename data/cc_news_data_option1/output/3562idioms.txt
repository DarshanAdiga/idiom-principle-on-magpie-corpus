“I have enjoyed getting stuck into it,” is Charlie McConalogue’s reaction to his first few days as Minister for Agriculture. He describes his appointment by Micheál Martin last week as a “great honour” and emphasises that he is well aware that he needs to hit the ground running in his new role. &lsquo;It is not the way he would have wanted to be appointed&rsquo;Despite the upheaval caused by the sacking and resignation respectively of his two predecessors, Charlie McConalogue doesn&rsquo;t believe the role of Agriculture Minister has been damaged.&ldquo;I think it has been a source of frustration and disappointment as to how things have happened.&ldquo;It was a real source of personal disappointment to my predecessors. I know both were very passionate about the role and would have made very good ministers, but it wasn&rsquo;t to be,&rdquo; he says.While he conceded it is not the way he would have wanted to be appointed, he is delighted and honoured to have the opportunity.&ldquo;The priority now is to provide leadership to the Department and to hit the ground running.&rdquo;That will start this week when he meets all the main industry stakeholders.&ldquo;There has been great patience and understanding shown,&rdquo; he says about the farm organisations&rsquo; reaction to the political turbulence of the last few months.&ldquo;I have no doubt that farmers want to see us get a full grip on all the issues and I will give every waking moment to the role,&rdquo; he promises.Minister McConalogue says he is looking forward to being the person at the Cabinet table that would be speaking out and leading on behalf of the agri-food and marine sector.&ldquo;Agriculture has achieved a lot in terms of development in recent years.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a really important part of our economy and our largest indigenous employer. We are facing immediate challenges in the near future which we have to address, but in the medium to long term, there is a really good story that we can continue to build on,&rdquo; he says.ConvergenceThe controversial issue of farm payments&rsquo; convergence is one Minister McConalogue was outspoken about as opposition spokesman.Prior to the election, he had said the convergence process should continue including during the transition period in advance of the next CAP programme commencing.As to his position now, he explains that the Commission&rsquo;s proposals for the next CAP are that all member states will be required to reach at least 75pc convergence by 2026.&ldquo;So the convergence process is something that is going to happen and something that we will support.&ldquo;There is going to have to be a wider decision as to whether we go further than that (more than 75pc). That is something that I will be engaging with farm organisations on and consulting very widely on,&rdquo; he says.In terms of convergence within the transitional period, he will be engaging with the Department and farm organisations on the issue in the coming months. &ldquo;It is something I will consult on first,&rdquo; he adds.

Amnesty International condemned Malta Tuesday for "illegal tactics" in the Mediterranean against immigrants attempting to cross from North Africa.
 The Maltese government's approach may have led to avoidable deaths, the rights group argued, in a new report. The report was published hours after the UN called on Malta and the EU to work to end a humanitarian crisis aboard a cargo ship off the island nation.
 "The Maltese government had resorted to dangerous and illegal measures for dealing with the arrivals of refugees and migrants at sea," said the rights group.
 "The escalation of tactics included arranging unlawful pushbacks to Libya, diverting boats towards Italy rather than rescuing people in distress and illegally detaining hundreds of people in ill-equipped ferries off Malta's waters," Amnesty said in the report.
 ## Coronavirus causes closed ports
 Malta and Italy closed their ports to migrants in April as the coronavirus pandemic led to widespread lockdowns across the two countries. Malta said it needed all its resources to fight the disease.
 Malta has received 2,161 illegal immigrants in 2020 — a number that Amnesty admits requires "considerable" resources "for such a small country."

“There’s no excuse for it. I heard Coach talking about how we didn’t have a chance to hit, but a lot of us have been playing football for 10 or 15 years,” Navy senior cornerback Cameron Kinley said. “That’s not our identity. We have to be more physical up front, on the back end, just across the board. That wasn’t the Navy defense we showed last season.”

Navy finished with 149 yards of offense, the second-lowest total of the Niumatalolo era. The Mids managed only seven first downs — the fewest during Niumatalolo’s tenure — due largely to the offensive line’s inability to get any movement. It was a disappointing starting debut for senior quarterback Dalen Morris, who completed 2 of 4 passes for 16 yards and managed only 2 yards on seven rushes.
 “That was a tough game to be part of, and I’m sure it was a tough game to watch as well,” Morris said. “It comes down to execution. We have to execute, and in the end of the day we didn’t do that.”
 Morris appeared somewhat jittery and also had issues with his footwork, slipping several times on the artificial surface. However, he was under constant duress as the offensive line could not open holes in the running game or provide proper protection in passing situations.
 “Grade-wise, I would say it’s an F. The offense is on me. It starts with me and ends with me,” Morris said. “You go back to the drawing board. You put your hard hat back on and go to work.”

Kagame on Sunday said Rusesabagina "will have to pay for these crimes." The complaint filed with the U.N. special rapporteur says that "elevates the risk of Mr. Rusesabagina being tortured or subjected to cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment, as it provides police and prison authorities license to take justice into their own hands without the need for a legal process."
