You're probably already cautious about classic fountain drinks, and rightly so: A 32-oz. cola contains up to 108 g sugar, the equivalent of roughly 14 packets of Pop Rocks. However, artificially sweetened diet drinks may pose problems, too. Some research suggests that sweet tastes prime the brain for sustenance--and when no calories come down the pike, the body's food demand can intensify. If you want to cut down on sugar, order a beverage that's inherently calorie-free (such as seltzer, plain water, or unsweetened iced tea) or one that delivers bonafide nourishment (such as skim milk or OJ).

Then, we’ll have better conditions for the vulnerable to live more free lives.

And then it’s up to the consumer if they choose to shop there per the proprietor’s rules.

When Halloween returns each October, so do the 50-year-old memories for actress Judith O'Dea who starred as Barbra in the 1968 horror classic "Night of the Living Dead" as one of several characters taking refuge in an isolated farmhouse under attack from flesh-eating ghouls.      O'Dea remembers watching the film on the big screen for the first time when it premiered in her hometown of Pittsburgh, where the film was also shot, although she recalls identifying more as an audience member rather than one of the cast.      "I looked at myself and began critiquing my performance," said O'Dea from Flagstaff, Arizona. "Then suddenly I found myself forgetting it was Judith O'Dea up there and became wrapped up in the storyline. That was a wonderful indication of a powerful story that could hold people's attention."      Over the years, O'Dea has also learned to look beyond the film's horror scenes and appreciate director George Romero's filmmaking skills.      "There's a scene where I'm pressing the button on a musical box which George was shooting from the floor up," she explained. "He was shooting right through the box and for a fraction of a second you see Barbra's eyes which I thought was a beautiful artistic shot. Then at the end when it alternates between still shots of the bodies and live-action, that was a great effective use of the camera."      The film, says O'Dea, broke barriers in the industry.      "As an independent movie made outside Hollywood, it raised its own money which I guess you could call one of the first Kickstarter's for a film. It was also filmed almost like a docudrama - unusual for the 60s - and there's no happy ending because everybody died."      Shot on a shoestring budget of just $114,000, O'Dea says her final scene being dragged from the farmhouse still haunts her.      "In your mind it's all pretend, but you get involved in the scene," she said. "With all those ghoul hands grabbing at me, it was actually quite frightening and took me back to the fear I felt as a child when I saw Vincent Price's face fall apart in the (1953) 'House of Wax.' That scared me so badly my folks had to take me from the theater. Whenever I'm called upon to be frightened in a role, I just think of that Vincent Price scene."      Another memorable scene from the film produced one of the classic lines in all horror films, said to O'Dea's character by actor Russell Streiner who plays her brother in the opening cemetery scene shot at the Evans City Cemetery in Pennsylvania.      "I don't think a week goes by that someone doesn't come up to me and say, 'They're coming to get you Barbra!'" said O'Dea, laughing. So has she grown weary of hearing the quote through all these years?      "How could I be tired of hearing something that has changed my life so considerably?" she says. "I love it when fans repeat the line to me. I feel so lucky to have been a part of something that was so different and has lasted so long."

Crypto.com slides to descending triangle support as a breakdown to $0.12 looms. The on-chain analysis places the most robust support between $0.137 and $0.14. Crypto.com is still retracing from the highs traded in August at $0.192. A higher low pattern has been forming below a descending trendline. On the downside, support at $0.14 played a crucial role in ensuring that losses are mitigated. Attempts to resume the uptrend has only resulted in lock-step trading. WalletConnect adds support for CRO DeFi Wallet As the Decentralized finance ecosystem seeks mainstream acceptance, adoption is a priority for projects in the sector. For this reason, support on multiple platforms does not only increases their utility but also exposes them to a broader audience. Crypto.com announced on Wednesday via Twitter that WalletConnect had integrated support for CRO DeFi Wallet for mobile. Besides that, WalletConnect announced a new update called v1.3.0. The update brings onboard features such as "copy to clipboard" and a new "mobile link interface. Crypto.com breakdown seems imminent The DeFi token recently suffered a blow due to the rejection at the 100-day Simple Moving Average as well as the hypotenuse of the descending triangle pattern. On the downside, the token is holding at that triangle support. If the price breaks below this technical pattern, the bearish outlook will gain weight, shoving CRO in a downward trajectory. The bearish narrative is emphasized by the Relative Strength Index (RSI) as it slides towards the oversold. However, the low trading volume at the moment hints that price action will not be rapid, at least before the breakout comes into the picture. Further down, support is expected at the 200-day moving average near $0.12. CRO/USD daily chart IntoTheBlock's IOMAP model shows that the path to recovery is not as congested. The only challenging resistance zone lies between $0.155 and $0.16. Previously, approximately 1,300 addresses bought about 230 million CRO. If this zone is bypassed, price action may continue to $0.17. On the downside, enormous support stands behind the cryptocurrency, running from $0.137 to $0.14. Here, 295 addresses bought roughly 3.4 billion CRO. It is doubtful that the expected declines will slice through this zone. CRO IOMAP chart The "Daily New Addresses" metric by IntoTheBlock displays a gradual increase in the number of new addresses joining the network. These addresses shot up from 186 recorded on October 10 to 228 on October 13. Persistent growth prints a bullish picture for Crypto.com in the future. In other words, new addresses bring in liquidity, which supports the growth in CRO's value and leads to network growth in general. CRO new addresses chart Looking at the other side of the fence Although CRO is hanging at the edge of a cliff due to the formation of a descending triangle pattern, support highlighted by the IOMAP is strong enough to invalidate the bearish outlook to $0.12. On the other hand, new addresses joining the network are likely to increase liquidity for the token; hence recovery could be in the offing. If CRO/USD resumes the uptrend above the 50-day SMA, upward price action will aim for $0.18.

PARIS, Oct 14 (Reuters) - French authorities have caught a black Canadian wolf that escaped from a wildlife park during heavy flooding in southern France more than a week ago but six others remain on the run.
 The seven black Canadian wolves escaped from the Alpha animal park in the Mercantour national reserve, 80 km (50 miles) north of the city of Nice, during massive river flooding which destroyed their enclosure.
 The captured wolf was tranquilised with a dart gun in a large operation on Monday involving a helicopter, a spokeswoman for the French Office for Biodiversity (OFB) said.
 "Chances are that the (other) black wolves are still in the zone, they are used to being fed," she told Reuters on Wednesday.
 The search for the other six wolves is continuing in mountainous terrain that is hard to access as many roads remain blocked because of flood damage.
 The OFB has said the wolves are not dangerous to humans as they were born in captivity and do not know how to hunt, but it has warned against approaching them.
 The spokeswoman said 13 wolves of three different subspecies had been in the park before the floods; the seven black Canadian wolves, three grey European wolves, and three white Arctic wolves, each in a separate enclosure.
 Two Arctic wolves, whose enclosure was the closest to the river, have been found dead and one is missing but presumed to be dead.
 The spokeswoman said the three European grey wolves had stayed in their enclosure after the floods but were tranquilised by police and moved to a different facility.
 At least six people died and more than a dozen are believed still missing after the worst flooding to hit southeastern France for more than a century, when swollen rivers washed away houses, bridges and parts of roads. (Reporting by Geert De Clercq Editing by Gareth Jones)

IBM said that the current Cloud Pak for Security release includes 25 pre-built connections to IBM and third-party data sources as well as 165 case-management integrations which describe out-of-the-box automation and orchestration playbooks to streamline response actions for security teams.
 The new release also includes support for multivendor threat-intelligence databases. Aside from its own X-Force Threat Intelligence Feed, the platform will also include pre-built integration with AlienVault OTX, Cisco Threatgrid, MaxMind Geolocation, SANS Internet StormCenter and Virustotal.
 “The idea is to help customers get enriched, up-to-date threat information from as many sources as possible so they can accurately and quickly respond to a threat situation,” Youngblood said. He said the continued integration of security intelligence is important as customers tie in more resources from cloud providers and support growing COVID-era remote-network workloads.
 IBM said it will also offer a new managed service offering based on Cloud Pak for Security that would offer enterprise customers or other service providers a turnkey platform to support end-to-end threat management.

In 1978, Houston Oilers coach Bum Phillips gave Don Shula about the best compliment a football coach can receive.
   
 "He can take his'n and beat your'n and take your'n and beat his'n," Phillips said of the legendary Miami Dolphins' coach.
   
 In other words, he can take his players and beat yours and take your players and beat his. The closest thing to Shula in the pantheon of Richmond Academy football is Frank Inman, the state championship-winning coach from the 1950s.
   
 While I'm not ready to put current Richmond Academy coach Lyle Burns in the same sentence as Inman, it's an important concept to understand when looking into what he's accomplishing at 910 Russell St.
   
 Richmond Academy (4-1) has already matched its win total from a year ago and is off to its second-best start of Burns' tenure. The Musketeers have wins over Evans and Lakeside and added a region win over Harlem Friday, a game that was really a microcosm of their season.
   
 Burns said after the 20-10 victory that his team still needs to become more physical on both lines of scrimmage and cut down on the pre-snap penalties. He was quick to note future opponents Thomson and Burke County, knowing that their path to a region title won't get any easier.
   
 "We had a few administrative penalties before the ball was snapped, which was discouraging," he said after the win. "Those that happen during the play happen, but you've got to eliminate offsides, false starts and those things. Those were disappointing, but hopefully we can get those cleaned up."
   
 The lack of physicality on the line contributed heavily in the 33-21 loss to Vidalia.
   
 Despite the mistakes, Richmond Academy is beating teams that, frankly, appear to be better. They're beating teams that are bigger, stronger and faster. They forced a run-first Evans team into three interceptions in a 17-16 win. They held an explosive Harlem rushing attack to one touchdown.
   
 They're going against bigger offensive and defensive lines and faster skill players and winning. They're doing so with a sophomore quarterback that's still getting settled in under the Friday night lights.
   
 But how?
   
 The short answer is coaching. Offensive coordinator Brian Lewis is spreading opposing defenses out and using option plays to take the attention off Jack Murphy, which allows playmakers like Chris Murray and Kellen McDuffie to get into open space. The icing on the cake is running back Rashad Williams, whose ability to run between the tackles takes another level of pressure off Murphy.
   
 While a bit undersized, the Richmond defense is arguably one of the most fundamentally sound units in the area. The use of positioning has been able to trump speed on the perimeter and they don't shoot themselves in the foot by missing tackles. They always seem to be around the football, allowing them to take advantage of offensive miscues.
   
 Now, time will tell if this assessment will hold up. The Musketeers host Thomson (4-1) this week in what will be their biggest test so far this season. We'll find out if Richmond is here to stay or how much more they have to grow to contend for a region title.

Senator Amy Klobuchar asked Barrett whether she took President Trump at his word when he tweeted in 2015 that he wanted his judicial appointments to "do the right thing" with regard to the Affordable Care Act. Barrett reiterated that Mr. Trump had never put any political pressure on her to overturn the ACA.
 "I can't really speak to what the president has said on Twitter. He hasn't said any of that to me," Barrett said. "No one has elicited from me any commitment in the case or even brought up a commitment in the case."
 Barrett said she would not consider any campaign promises when making decisions, explaining that "the reason why judges have life tenure is to insulate them from those pressures."
 Klobuchar asked Barrett if she would have sided with Justice Antonin Scalia in his dissenting opinion in a 2012 case which upheld the ACA. Barrett said that opinions as she professed as an academic did not necessarily reflect how she would rule as a justice.
 "A professor professes and can opine, but it's very different in the judicial decision-making process," Klobuchar said. "Now, having been a judge for three years, I appreciate greatly the distinctions between academic writing and academic speaking and judicial decision making."
