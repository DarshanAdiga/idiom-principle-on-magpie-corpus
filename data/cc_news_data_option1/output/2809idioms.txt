President Dr Arif Alvi on Wednesday said Pakistan had immense potential in the field of digital economy and digital education and stressed the importance of fast data communication modes to explore vast opportunities in such areas.âPakistan has high prospects in making strides in digital economy, digital education and digital finance and is heading in right direction to cope with the challenges during current pandemic,â the President said in his address at the contract signing of High-speed Mobile Broadband Internet, here at the Aiwan-e-Sadr.President Alvi said the future highway to success was all about information gathering based upon internet and making it accessible for people. He mentioned that the new life pattern during the coronavirus pandemic demanded digitalized systems in areas particularly trade, commerce, education and health.He lauded the Ministry of Education for adopting new modes of teaching through television to address the challenges faced by students residing in towns with either low-speed internet or with no access.The President said Pakistan was proud to launch its first public-sector Virtual University in 2004, offering education at relatively low rates as compared to physically attending institutions that had several other overheads.The President said e-commerce and e-trade could prove a stimulus towards expansion of economy due to fast financial transactions.He said State Bank of Pakistan was working to launch digital payment system across the country in October, expressing confidence that the step would boost business across the board, including of small companiesAlso, he said, software being top of the value- addition chain could prove as effective marketing tool for products and mentioned the countryâs 30 percent improvement in software development scenario.President Alvi said access to information through digitalization would also provide a platform for women to help them thrive, thus ensuring their empowerment.He said digital information could also eliminate âelite captureâ of resources and quoted the book âCapital and Ideologyâ by French economist Thomas Piketty who defined education and health as two top areas of such notorious culture.He said Pakistan through reforms was resisting the elite capture, however India on the contrary, was reported with high inequality during 2014 to 2018, as mentioned by the French economist with full supporting data.The President stressed proper Right-of-Way policies for the broadband and mobile companies to effectively sort out matters related to installation of signal towers at peopleâs land. President Alvi said internet could be best used for improving skilled economy and mentioned that as Pakistan required one million nurses in health sector, online training courses could be a great option instead of brick and mortar education.\867

TradeTalks: Market and Macro Expectations for the Remainder of 2020 in light of #COVID19


--DocBreak--
A mess of a season could still be saved by the Champions League but even the most optimistic of fans expect the worst against Bayern Munich, Barcelona's probable opponents in the quarter-finals.Many, including Lionel Messi, are worried even about getting past Napoli, with the pandemic-delayed last 16 matchup poised at 1-1. "I said long ago that if we continued in this way, it would be very difficult to win the Champions League and that has been shown to be the case in La Liga too," said a frustrated Messi after the loss to Osasuna on Thursday."If we want to fight for the Champions League we will have to change a lot because otherwise the match against Napoli, we will lose that as well."Just over a year on from almost winning the treble, Barcelona look set to finish without a trophy of any kind for the first time in 12 years.And yet the concern is not so much the many failures of this season but the possibility they could be just the start.Messi is 33 and his anger is directed primarily at the board, whose leadership has left Barcelona with a team seemingly neither for the present nor the future.There has been no succession plan for Messi since Neymar joined Paris Saint-Germain in 2018 and that world record fee has been squandered on players that have failed to settle or been sold to balance the books.Antoine Griezmann bought for 120 million euros, left Atletico Madrid for the Camp Nou and what he thought would be the pinnacle of his club career. Yet earlier this month, he was reduced to coming off the bench, against Atletico, in injury-time.And it is not just Messi nearing the end. Gerard Pique, Sergio Busquets, Luis Suarez and Jordi Alba are all 31 or older.Political blundersOff the pitch, political blunders have angered the dressing room, with Messi issuing a public rebuke to sporting director Eric Abidal in February over the sacking of Ernesto Valverde.Removing Valverde might have been understandable last summer after two successful years appeared to have run their course.But a change mid-season, with Barca top of the table, and to a coach like Quique Setien, whose ideas need time to be absorbed, now looks reckless.Setien has admitted managing a squad like Barcelona's has been a challenge for him. He has intimated that some players need to think more about the team.He has made mistakes too and it remains to be seen if he pays with his job. Bartomeu has said Setien will stay for the Champions League but the 2-1 home defeat by Osasuna intensified the doubts."I hope so," said Setien, when asked on Thursday if he would be in charge next month.But with presidential elections at the club to come next year, the position is not an attractive one for an elite coach.If Bartomeu's successor loses, Victor Font, a rival candidate, wants to appoint Xavi Hernandez. It means either Setien or his replacement face the prospect of one full season in the job, all the while lacking either authority or certainty in the long term.Zinedine Zidane has shown what can be done with an ageing Real squad that appears dead on its feet. But it is hard to see who could perform an equivalent rescue act at Barca or who would be prepared to do it with this board still in place.Without money to spend in the aftermath of the coronavirus pandemic, the answer could be to turn again to youth, with Riqui Puig and Ansu Fati already breaking through this season.Yet in a dysfunctioning team, desperate to win before Messi retires, that approach offers no guarantees.Messi's clock hangs over everything, with every failure enhanced by the sense that the club's greatest ever player is being wasted. The biggest worry now is it could get even worse.",

Kimberly Allen's funeral will be Saturday at a Hamilton funeral home, 20 days after the 28-year-old Brownwood woman lost her life in a suspected drunken- driving wreck.
   
 Allen was among a group in a front yard at Southside and Slayden in south Brownwood on the evening of June 28 when a Ford F-150 pickup approached from the south, heading north on Southside, Brownwood police have said. The truck left the road, entered the yard and struck Allen and three others, two of them children.
   
 Allen and the others were unloading furniture from a trailer when the wreck happened, police have said.
   
 Allen died at the scene.
   
 Police said the driver of the pickup, Margaret Harper, 38, was arrested on one charge of intoxication manslaughter and three charges of intoxication assault. Harper is free on bonds totaling $252,500.
   
 The wreck happened in front of the home where Erica Richardson, 32, and her husband, Robert, 43, live with their children. Erica Richardson, the other adult who was struck by the truck, was flown to Parkland Parkland Memorial Hospital in Dallas with injuries including damage to her left hand and fingers.
   
 Macyn Oliver, 5 -- who is Erica Richardson's stepdaughter -- was flown to Cook Children's Medical Center with injuries including a broker femur. Baylee Sharp, 8 -- Erica Richardson's biological daughter -- was treated at Brownwood Regional Medical Center.
   
 Erica and the children have all been released from the hospital. In addition to their physical injuries, Erica and the children -- as well as Robert Richardson, who saw the wreck but was not struck -- are suffering emotionally.
   
 "All I can do is replay that moment in my head," Erica Richardson said. "It's like a movie reel. It just plays in your head repeatedly. We're grown, and it's hard for us to deal with. But our babies  are having a hard, hard time with this. They cry at an ambulance. They cry at a car revving up."
   
 Robert Richardson was sitting in his car talking on his phone when the wreck happened, and he saw everything.
   
 "Our world was flipped upside down that day," Robert said.
   
 Robert and Erica Richardson said they were good friends with Allen. "She was the sweetest person you would ever meet," Erica said of her friend. "She was getting to know God."
   
 In an earlier interview, Allen's mother, Crystena Schneider, said Allen had a heart condition that prevented her from working and driving, and sometimes caused her to pass out.
   
 "We've known her for years," Robert Richardson said. "She kind of disappeared for a little bit. For the past four months she started coming around and we were really getting to know the real Kimberly.
   
 "She struggled to fix her life and she had everything going for her and we were really proud of her. If you ever met Kim, she's got a heart of gold and you would never, never forget her. She's just a person that if you ever came in contact with her, you would just love her personality and just everything about her."
   
 The Sunday the wreck happened, the Richardsons picked up Allen and they drove to Coleman. The Richardsons bought furniture at an estate sale, loaded it onto their trailer and drove it back to their Brownwood home.
   
 "We were unloading the trailer, looking at everything we had just got," Robert Richardson said. "We saw a truck lose control and we thought it had just lost control going around the corner."
   
 When the truck entered the yard, Erica Richardson screamed at the children to move. She doesn't recall what happened next, but she related what she's been told.
   
 "From what I was told, I was holding my 5-year-old trying to get out of the way. And that's when the truck hit us and the 5-year-old went flying. I guess I pushed my 8-year-old and I ran with my 5-year-old.
   
 "They told me that I was able to push (Baylee) out of the way in time. She did get cuts but luckily she didn't get really hurt. But I was holding Mason because I thought I could run with Mason and I just didn't make it in time. The truck hit us."
   
 Robert Richardson described what he saw as he sat in his car and talked on a phone.
   
 "Furniture just started flying," Robert said. "It all happened right in front of me, and I couldn't get out of the car in time to save anybody because it all happened so fast. I saw everybody get hit.
   
 "I saw Kimberly go under the truck. She got drug. She came out the back and it kicked her up in the air. She went kind of like a somersault, and landed and hit the ground."
   
 Robert and Erica rushed to Allen's side and pleaded with her to live. Robert waved his hand in front of Allen's eyes, hoping to show her that her friends were there.
   
 "Stay with us, stay with us," Robert yelled at his friend.
   
 "I was over Kim begging Kim just to hang on," Erica recalled.
   
 Multiple sirens wailed through the neighborhood as police, firefighters and Lifeguard Ambulance arrived. Erica Richardson heard someone say Allen had a pulse. But then she learned that Allen had died on the scene.
   
 "My kids are all traumatized from it," Erica said. "My 8-year-old, she's very, very traumatized. She saw everybody get run over. She said 'mom, I tried to save Kim. The 5-year-old will tell me I wish it had never happened. She'll tell the 'the truck hurt me.'"
   
 Richard Robertson said he feels guilt because he wishes he'd been out of the car when the wreck happened. "Maybe I could have pushed her out of the way, pushed Macyn or somebody out of the way," Richard said. "Because I'm a big boy and I can take a hit. So that's something that I have to live with and I have to overcome."
   
 Visitation for Allen will be from 3 p.m. to 8 p.m. Friday at the Riley Funeral Home in Hamilton. Her Funeral will be at 11 a.m. Saturday at the funeral home, with burial in Gentrys Mill Cemetery.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Secretary of State Mike Pompeo argued Thursday for a more limited U.S. view of global human rights advocacy based on the principals laid out by America’s Founding Fathers, a suggestion critics assumed meant stepping away from more modern concepts such as support for women and the LGBQT communities around the world.Pompeo, speaking in Philadelphia, singled out property rights and religious freedom as "foremost" principals in a speech that elsewhere complained about the "proliferation" of protections in international agreements related to human rights. "We are forced to grapple with tough choices about which rights to promote and how to think about this," he said. "Americans have not only unalienable rights, but also positive rights granted by governments, courts and multilateral bodies. Many are worth defending in light of our founding; others aren't."Pompeo on Thursday released a report produced by the Commission on Unalienable Rights, which he tasked last year with conducting a broad review of U.S. human rights policy, arguing at the time that it had “lost its bearings.” Before its release, many human rights groups were skeptical of the commission, whose chairwoman was conservative legal scholar Mary Ann Glendon, a former U.S. ambassador to the Holy See.Pompeo noted that the report emphasizes property rights and religious liberty. "No one can enjoy the pursuit of happiness if you cannot own the fruits of your own labor. And no society can retain its legitimacy or a virtuous character without religious freedom," he said. The report did not produce any specific recommendations and steered clear of endorsing policy proposals. But experts who parsed it for direction noted, for example, that it referred to abortion and same-sex marriage not as rights but "divisive social and political controversies."Critics such as Sen. Bob Menendez, the ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said the report would damage the United States' reputation as a champion of human rights around the world by narrowing the scope of who deserves protection."As feared, Secretary Pompeo used his speech to insinuate a hierarchy of rights where property rights and religious liberty are 'foremost' rights and some rights are not 'worth defending,''' said the New Jersey Democrat.Critics also faulted the makeup of the commission, saying it was weighted with conservatives, and the public did not have sufficient opportunity to weigh in on its findings before the report's release. "As was clear from the start, Secretary Pompeo's Commission on Unalienable Rights was designed to challenge the international consensus with a narrow view of human rights, that among other things would leave LGBTQ people even more vulnerable to violence and discrimination," said David Stacy, government affairs director of Human Rights Campaign.Pompeo also took aim in his speech at demonstrators "pulling down statues" and "desecrating monuments, in echoes of President Donald Trump's recent speech at Mount Rushmore. The secretary of state said it was an attack on the people who fought for the rights laid out in the Declaration of Independence.
