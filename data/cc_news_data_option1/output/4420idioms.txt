It’s absurd, she said, that in the current environment political concerns about the U.S. debt and deficit should stand in the way of more deficit spending to right the economy. “What we’re seeing in the financial market demand for U.S. Treasurys says we have a different environment, and it would be foolish not to use that information,” said Edelberg, today the director of the Hamilton Project at the Brookings Institution. “We understand a lot better how monetary policy operates when we’re at the zero lower bound, and we should take that on board.

The Dolphins liked Tagovailoa’s Type A personality. They’re right about that, too. It’s fun. It’s feels infectious. If Tagovailoa has an opening stretch like Herbert — 12 touchdowns against three interceptions, 108.1 rating — the Tua Train will be in high gear.
 "He understands that it’s not Tua against the Rams,'' Flores said. “It’s the Dolphins against the Rams. He’s a team guy and I think his teammates are supportive of him. That’s kind of the approach we’ve all taken. I think he’s taken that approach also.”
 Yes, that’s what the coaches say, what they have to say. It matters, too. Marino stepped into a team just off the Super Bowl in 1983. Tannehill stepped into a team with holes across the roster in 2012. You don’t need a lecture on the difference.
 This day is still all about Tua. The curtain goes up on his Dolphins time. The game matters in that context. The moment, one of offered hope, needs no overselling.

Brutal.
 As in the kind of hits fans will see in the NFL's most physical (and probably best) rivalry. Each defense and special teams sets the tone early and doesn't relent.
 "This is one of those physical, heavyweight fights," Ravens cornerback Jimmy Smith says. "I feel it's the same every time we play them. It feels the same way. It feels like you're about to go into what you know as a championship fight -- regardless of ... records or anything like that. You're going into a dog fight and you're going to be beat up at the end of this game."
 Baltimore has forced a turnover in 19 straight games, the longest active streak in the league. Baltimore and Pittsburgh are tied atop the NFL in QB hits with 64. The Steelers lead with 26 sacks, the Ravens have 22. The Steelers h ave at least one sack in 63 straight games, the third-longest string in NFL history. During their three-game winning streak, the Ravens have 16 sacks and 41 QB hits.
 OUCH!
 New England (2-4) at Buffalo (5-2)
 If ever the Bills are going to put aside the torture that has been their matchups with the Patriots for nearly two decades, it's now.
 The Patriots have won seven straight in the series and are 35-5 against the Bills since Bill Belichick took over as coach in 2000. Tom Brady was 32-3 against Buffalo and set the NFL record for most wins against one opponent. New England's 76 wins over the Bills are their most against anyone.
 But these Patriots have dropped three in a row, struggling in all phases on the field and the sideline.
 Not that the Bills are setting the NFL afire. Buffalo has combined for 51 points, 998 yards and 692 yards passing in the past three games. In Buffalo's first four games, the offense generated 123 points, 1,639 yards and 1,326 yards passing.
 Minnesota (1-5) at Green Bay (5-1)
 This usually is a prime NFC North game. Obviously not in 2020 with the Vikings floundering.
 The Packers have won the past three matchups, with the 43-34 victory in the season opener indicative of where these teams were headed. Packers coach Matt LaFleur is 8-0 in NFC North games. That doesn't mean Aaron Rodgers is complacent about facing Minnesota.
 "Anytime you play a Mike Zimmer team, you've got to be ready for everything," Rodgers says. "He's a phenomenal coach. I was telling a friend of mine, to see him mentioned being on the hot seat, to me, is absolutely crazy. I think he's one of the best coaches in the league and has been for a long time. They don't all give you the trouble and scheme that Mike does."
 Dallas (2-5) at Philadelphia (2-4-1)
 Lots of stats comparing these two disappointments, but more appropriate would be the attitudes in Dallas (timid, even passive) and Philly (resourceful and aggressive).
 Sure, both sides have experienced major injuries, with the Eagles missing nearly half their starters and the Cowboys down to a third-string quarterback if No. 2 Andy Dalton (concussion) can't go. At least the Eagles have shown some grit in the face of adversity.
 As for the stats, the Cowboys are last in turnover margin (minus-13) and giveaways (16), and tied for last in takeaways (3) and interceptions (1). They've allowed the most points in the NFL, 34.7 per game.
 The Eagles might have found a keeper in WR Travis Fulgham, who has 357 yards receiving since playing his first game in Week 4 -- the most in the first four games with the Eagles since Terrell Owens had 364 in 2004.
 Los Angeles Chargers (2-4) at Denver (2-4)
 The least of the division games, with both of these clubs also-rans in the AFC West.
 The Chargers have lost seven consecutive AFC West games, but rookie Justin Herbert's 308.4 passing yards per game lead the AFC. Former Chargers RB Melvin Gordon leads the Broncos in rushing yards (349) and touchdowns (five) but he also has three fumbles, two last week.
 Los Angeles Rams (5-2) at Miami (3-3)
 Tua Time. Strange timing, perhaps, considering the havoc Aaron Donald and Leonard Floyd could cause in the starting debut of QB Tua Tagovailoa.
 But coach Brian Flores opted to make the move during Miami's bye week even though Ryan Fitzpatrick was on a hot streak. The Dolphins are on pace for their highest-scoring season since 1986, averaging 26.7 points per game.
 New York Jets (0-7) and Kansas City (6-1)
 Can a 19-point spread seem too low? In this case, probably.
 The Jets gained 4 total yards in the second half last week against Buffalo. Sam Darnold returned from a shoulder injury and was sacked six times.
 Chiefs coach Andy Reid can tie Curly Lambeau (229) for the fifth-most wins in NFL history. QB Patrick Mahomes has thrown a TD pass in 18 consecutive games, the longest streak in franchise history and currently the longest string in the NFL. Anyone want to bet the Jets will get in the way of Reid or Mahomes?
 Indianapolis (4-2) at Detroit (3-3)
 Although Philip Rivers has been sacked a league-low six times, look for the Colts to establish Jonathan Taylor in the run game against a leaky run defense ranked 26th.
 Detroit has won consecutive games for the first time in more than a year, but needed yet another unfathomable collapse by Atlanta to do so. Matthew Stafford led the 36th game-winning drive of his career against the Falcons.
 Las Vegas (3-3) at Cleveland (5-2)
 Four of the Browns' five wins have come against tailenders, and they have four such opponents remaining on the schedule. The Raiders are somewhere in between good and bad, but Las Vegas is the only team to allow at least 24 points in every game. Only eight teams in the Super Bowl era have allowed at least 24 points in the first seven outings.
 At least the Raiders won't have to face WR Odell Beckham Jr. (knee).
 The Browns are looking to go 4-0 at home for the first time since 1963.
 Tennessee (5-1) at Cincinnati (1-5-1)
 Two clubs in need of a defensive makeover, but at least the Titans have overcome those shortcomings: Tennessee has won four games with a scoring drive in the final two minutes of regulation or overtime.
 Cincinnati can't stop the run, and even good defenses struggle with Titans star RB Derrick Henry. At least top overall draft selection Joe Burrow is producing, with five 300-yard games. He's the first rookie in league history to do that in seven games.
 New Orleans (4-2) at Chicago (5-2)
 The Saints have won five straight in this series. Alvin Kamara leads the NFL with 824 yards from scrimmage, an average of 137.3 per game, and Drew Brees is heating up even without No. 1 target Michael Thomas.
 The Bears rank 29th in yards per game and 27th in scoring (19.7 points), and their ground game is virtually nonexistent. Their defense wore down when Chicago was pummeled by the Rams on Monday night.
 Tampa Bay (5-2) at New York Giants (1-6), Monday night
 New York had some success against Brady, including two Super Bowl victories. But those Giants were far more talented than this lot.
 Brady was sensational in picking part Las Vegas last week, has more playmakers than he can keep happy, and the Tampa defense is stepping up.

After a year of deep disruption, America is poised for a presidential election that renders a verdict on the nation's role in the world and the direction of its economy, on its willingness to contain an escalating pandemic and its ability to confront systemic racial inequity.
 But the two men on the ballot, President Donald Trump and Democrat Joe Biden, offer more than just differing solutions for the country's most pressing problems. The choice before voters is a referendum on the role of the presidency itself and a test of the sturdiness of democracy, with the president challenging the legitimacy of the outcome even before Election Day and law enforcement agencies braced for the possibility of civil unrest.
 "There's more than just your standard ideological difference between the two candidates. There's a fundamentally different view of what the presidency is and what leadership means for the nation," said Jeffrey Engel, director of the Center for Presidential History at Southern Methodist University.

 Did you know that jack-o-lanterns were originally carved out of turnips? The ghoulish jack-o-lanterns that are so much a part of Halloween can be traced back to an old Irish tale about a man named Stingy Jack, notorious as a drunkard and a person who liked to play practical jokes. According to legend, Jack tricked the Devil into a tree and then forced him to stay there by carving a cross in the tree trunk.
 Unable to enter Heaven because of his profligate ways after he died and turned away by the Devil, Stingy Jack wandered the world, searching for a resting place. To light his way, Stingy Jack used a burning coal in a hollowed out turnip – hence the name “Jack’s Lantern.‘ The first jack-o-lanterns, in fact, were carved out of turnips but since pumpkins were much more abundant in America after the Irish emigrated here, the switch to pumpkins was made.

October 31, 2020
 Thank goodness the US Justice Department has again saved food consumers from…well, it’s kind of hard to say. This time, the target is chicken producers, but I wrote about similar events several years ago with the dairy industry.
 The latest developments involve a $110 million settlement and indictments of executives, such as chicken producer Pilgrim’s Pride on allegations of price fixing, a violation of antitrust laws. The usual impassioned arguments related to saving the hapless consumer are trotted out, but as with the dairy case, even minimal examination of the details behind the scenes leaves little or nothing to be desired with the whole process.
 Let’s start with price fixing—the idea that several firms in the same industry worked together to control supply of a product for their mutual benefit. The definition of price fixing is shockingly wide open—for example, the agreement can be “inferred from conduct” (not written or stated) and goes beyond consumer prices to include “shipping fees, warranties, discount programs, or financing rates.” In addition, “circumstantial” evidence of price fixing may be all that’s needed. As stated at the link above, “When competitors agree to restrict competition, the result is often higher prices.” But surely even regulators can understand that other factors, such as increased input costs or taxes, can also result in higher prices for consumers?
 The picture gets more muddled as one investigates the evidence. We get insight into how what may have been a meaningless metric played a major role. The now- suspended Georgia Dock market estimate was an ongoing voluntary survey of the prices chicken companies have been receiving. One Georgia Department of Agriculture employee would simply call around and compile the data from producers in a report. Of course, there was no way to audit the information being received and reported, but that didn’t stop a group of Wall Street investors from making a big bet against the chicken producers. Never mind the validity of the data—if it looked good on a spreadsheet, that’s apparently all that mattered to them. When the payoff didn’t happen as planned, the genius investors hired a lawyer who uncovered a document from the Georgia Department of Agriculture (from the same person who compiled the Georgia Dock) that questioned its validity. This, combined with discrepancies in different price reports, is what led to the price-fixing lawsuit, the settlement, and potential jail time for some chicken executives—never mind the very real possibility that supermarkets simply ignored the Georgia Dock and negotiated prices with chicken producers on their own. Or that the producers were somehow responding to market forces on their own. I suppose you can’t blame a group of Wall Street investors for not understanding that functioning markets can actually do several things—rise, fall, stay the same—and don’t just increase for decades on end by design.
 It’s also comical that, while evidence of chicken executives discussing prices exists, the same documents also reported undisputed competition—you know, the thing the Justice Department says they should be doing. In one case, an executive stated that another company should “feel the pain” of supply shortages. “We should not help them one micron” was another response.
 The fact that this is happening to chicken meat producers indicatives a galling lack of historical perspective for this industry and what it has meant for consumers. Chicken meat is now ubiquitous in the US and around the world, and this has only occurred in the past several decades due to tremendous advances in productivity and efficiency. Several decades ago, chicken was more expensive than beef, but thanks to research and advancements in technology, the time it takes for a bird to get to market is less than half what it was a few decades ago. There’s no question that issues of pollution originating from chicken waste and animal welfare concerns (not to mention worries about processing plant employees) exist, but given the enormous progress within the industry, there’s no reason to think that these things won’t continue to improve as well. Especially if we still give the market some breathing room now and then.
 Unfortunately, this latest round of DC theater may drag on for years. However, we can feel some relief knowing that if productive groups like the chicken industry have taught us anything, it’s that they’ll find some way to persevere while continuing to supply more and more people a quality source of animal protein and nutrients—the very things we need to survive, grow, and flourish.

The decision — that a Herbert throw was as safe a bet as a carry, even on a rushing down — was emblematic of how Chargers coaches have come to regard the 22-year-old quarterback who, technically speaking, wasn’t supposed to be their starter yet.
 Herbert was thrust into the spot in Week 2 after Tyrod Taylor, the starter Los Angeles had signed to a two-year contract that included a reported $11 million in guaranteed money, had his lung punctured by a team doctor injecting a painkiller before game time. In Taylor’s place during an afternoon game that was broadcast widely, Herbert pushed the Super Bowl champion Kansas City Chiefs to overtime, running for a 4-yard touchdown on his first NFL drive and ultimately finishing with a better passer rating (94.4 to 90.9) and more yards (311 to 302) than Patrick Mahomes, though not the win.

But the two men on the ballot, President Donald Trump and Democrat Joe Biden, offer more than just differing solutions for the country's most pressing problems. The choice before voters is a referendum on the role of the presidency itself and a test of the sturdiness of democracy, with the president challenging the legitimacy of the outcome even before Election Day and law enforcement agencies braced for the possibility of civil unrest.
