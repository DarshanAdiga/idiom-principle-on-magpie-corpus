Harvest greens regularly to keep the plants producing. You’ll enjoy the convenience and have no excuse not to boost the flavor and nutritional value of your meals.
 Reserve a space in front of a sunny window to grow a tomato or pepper plant. Expand your growing options and ensure a bountiful harvest by supplementing natural daylight with artificial lights. Start with compact tomato and pepper varieties that require less space. You will probably need to start plants from seeds when growing these vegetables outside the normal outdoor gardening season. Once the plants start flowering, you will need to lend a helping hand. Give the stems a shake for pollination and eventually fruit formation to occur.
 Reduce maintenance and the mess with self-watering containers. These planters have reservoirs that hold water that moves into the soil via wicking systems. This provides the plants with a constant supply of water while extending the time between watering. Plus, the self-contained watering setup minimizes the risk of water getting on your floor.
 Start plans for your indoor edible garden with a walk around your home to identify potential growing spaces. Then develop a list of favorite herbs, greens and vegetables you and your family enjoy. Match the space to your favorites and invest in plants and resources that fit your gardening goals and help ensure success. Then start growing and enjoying the benefits of fresh, homegrown produce all year long.

Disgraced producer Harvey Weinstein has been sentenced to 23 years in prison for rape and sexual assault.
 Weinstein was found guilty in a trial in New York last month, finalising a dramatic fall from grace for one of Hollywood's most powerful figures.
 The 67-year-old appeared in court on Wednesday in a wheelchair.
 Weinstein's lawyers had appealed for leniency, insisting that even the minimum sentence of five years could be a "life sentence" for him.
 But prosecutors argued Weinstein should be given the maximum possible sentence given his "lifetime of abuse" towards women and "lack of remorse" for his actions.

Gronkowski said in August that while a full-time turn to WWE might be a lot, he liked the idea of doing one big match with the company.
 "With wrestling, I don't feel like I would be a full-time wrestler, but there is one thing I'm down for," Gronkowski said in August, per ESPN. "And that's to do one crazy match. Practice it for a little bit, go out there -- like in a Royal Rumble -- go out there, I got my friend in WWE [Rawley], practice it and do a full-on WWE match. I'm not saying when, maybe five years. I got the rest of my life to do that. I've always dreamed about doing that, just one time, going in there and going full-out. That may be a possibility, one time, down the road."
 With WrestleMania approaching fast and Gronkowski rumored to be tied to WWE in the near future, it looks as though that dream could become a reality pretty soon.

It's not where you start, it's where you finish.
 That's part of what Corsicana's Lady Tigers softball team will take with them after losing to Ennis 10-5 Tuesday night in their District 14-5A opener.
 Before it's over these same Lady Tigers, one of the youngest teams you will find anywhere, could be in the middle of the playoff hunt. That's the plan, and if you follow this program you know how far this team has come already.
 "We're better than we were last year, and Ennis is better," said second-year coach Courtney Anderson, who has just one senior in her starting lineup. "I thought our energy was great. I thought we played well. We had one bad inning."
 Ennis had a run-away inning in the fifth when the Lady Lions scored six runs to take a 7-5 lead and the Lady Tigers couldn't come back despite threatening in the fifth, sixth and seventh.
 It's still hard to believe Kendall Dill's shot to left-center in the sixth didn't result in a two-run double . It sure looked like one when Dill hit the ball, but Ennis center fielder Clare Jasso made a nice play running the ball down and taking a hit from Dill.
 "When it left her bat I thought it was going to be a double off the wall," Anderson said. "Kendall had a real good game at the plate."
 She sure did. It was Dill whose two-run double ignited Corsicana's five-run first inning that knocked out Ennis starter Makayla Funtes. Aubree Lalani came in and pitched a gem for the Lady Lions, getting big outs with runners on base. The Lady Lions left nine runners on, including five over the final three innings.
 "I thought we hit well in the first inning, but the bats went cold,"Anderson said. "We hit but we didn't get THE hit."
 Marliegh Tidwell pitched well and was mowing down Ennis batters. She gave up an unearned run in the first and then shut down Ennis until the fifth, giving up just one hit -- a single in the third -- while striking out six through that stretch. She finished with nine Ks.
 "Marliegh pitched really well," Anderson said.
 But Ennis opened the fifth with a single, a walk and a double, and Anderson went to Alyssa Wood.

BERLIN -- Germany will spend what it takes to tackle the coronavirus which is likely to infect up to 70% of the population in Europe's largest economy, Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Wednesday.
 "We will do what we need to get through this. And then at the end we will look at what that means for our budget," she told reporters, seeming to distance herself from Germany's policy of no new borrowing.
 Though conceding she did not know how the crisis would develop, Merkel said the risk was huge.
 "When the virus is out there, and the population has no immunity and no vaccination or therapy exists, then a high percentage - experts say 60 to 70% of the population - will be infected, so long as this remains the case," she said.
 That drew swift criticism from the Czech prime minister who said Merkel's remarks could cause panic.
 Germany has confirmed three deaths related to the coronavirus. It has reported 1,296 cases, according to the Robert Koch Institute for disease control.
 The chancellor was speaking after mass-selling daily Bild berated her for what it called "the corona chaos." "No appearances, no speech, no leadership in the crisis," it wrote.
 Merkel urged Germans to watch their personal hygiene and contacts, recommending they look each other in the eye "for a second longer" rather than shake hands.
 "We will do what is necessary as a country, and that is also together with Europe," added the chancellor, who spoke to fellow European Union (EU) leaders and the president of the European Central Bank (ECB) on Tuesday evening.
 "We cannot yet gauge the economic consequences… but we will react," said Merkel, whose government has promised "timely, targeted" stimulus.
 POST-WAR FEDERALISM IN SPOTLIGHT
 In a radio interview, Health Minister Jens Spahn said sealing borders, as neighbor Austria has done to Italians, would not work.
 At the news conference with Merkel, he urged Germans to stay away from soccer matches, concerts and clubs, but said he was "very reserved" about blanket closures of nurseries and schools as many public service workers rely on them being open.
 The crisis has drawn attention to Germany's federal system of government, in which power is devolved to the 16 states and regional authorities. They must decide for themselves whether to follow Spahn's advice to cancel events with over 1,000 people.
 Spahn said it was "astonishing" that no decision had been taken to call off a football match between Union Berlin and Bayern Munich scheduled in Berlin on Saturday, though the city later said it would take place behind closed doors.
 "The corona crisis shows that, without clear guidance, federalism in the fight against epidemics is reaching its limits," Bild wrote.
 Merkel said federalism did not mean anyone could evade responsibility, and that she would meet state premiers on Thursday to coordinate the coronavirus response.
 During Merkel's news conference, Berlin's city authorities said they had banned events with more than 1,000 participants until the end of Easter holidays in mid-April.
 Germany's federal system was agreed by its victorious enemies after World War Two and enshrined in its constitution to avoid a repeat of the centralized power wielded by the Nazis.

Atletico Madrid are tracking Arsenal striker Alexandre Lacazette with a view to a summer transfer, according to El Mundo Deportivo.
 In the summer of 2017, there was total agreement between the France international, Atletico and Olympique Lyonnais for the transfer but the deal never went through.
 That was due to Atleti’s transfer ban at the time, which ensured that the striker instead moved to North London – where he has netted 45 goals in two and a half seasons since, spread across 114 appearances.
 Despite a respectable goal return, it is thought that the striker has not filled his potential at the Gunners and this report claims Atleti have already sounded him out on several occasions.
 Indeed, back in January Marca reported on interest from Diego Simeone’s side in the France international, although no move materialised.
 There are long-term doubts over Diego Costa’s future in the Spanish capital and Lacazette could be a replacement.

"I think Marliegh got a little (tired) and needed a break," Anderson. "We use that combo all the time, and Alyssa pitched her best game last week, pitching six innings against Athens."
 Tidwell came back and retired the final out of the inning and finished the game, but Ennis put six runs across the plate in the inning.
 "They had that one inning, but we've got to hit," Anderson said. "We didn't score after the first inning and you can't go six innings without a run in this district."
 It's a tough district, but even after losing Tuesday, Anderson feels her team can be in the playoff hunt.
 "Every game in our district is going to be like that one (close and up in the air)," Anderson said. "We will compete in every game."
 That's how much Anderson likes her team, and of course the team would look a lot different if the Lady Tigers had their best player.
 Brinly Burke, a power-hitting catcher who led Corsicana in every offensive category a year ago as a freshman, is arguably the best high school softball player in the Golden Circle. She is out with an injury.
 But neither Anderson nor anyone else at Corsicana is making excuses. The coach and the kids believe this year's team has a chance to make the playoffs.
 There was plenty to like Tuesday as the Lady Tigers played solid defensively, including in left field where Jaylee Woolley made some memorable plays, and several players came through with some big hits early.
 Woolley led off the first with a sharp double, and Tidwell followed with a hard single up the middle. Dill came through with a bases-loaded two-run double and Sadie Mitchell, who can fly around the bases had an RBI single with a perfect bunt. Mitchell had two hits and a walk and stole two bases.
 "Marliegh pitched really well and we played pretty good defense," Anderson said. "We've just got to hit. We had opportunities to come back but we didn't get the big hit.''

A self-watering pot with a built-in overhead light such as the Gardener’s Revolution Light Garden Kit (gardeners.com) makes it easy to grow a variety of greens at the end of a counter, next to a desk or anywhere you have a few square feet of space.

The quick price collapse —which will impact already beleaguered countries such as Venezuela and Iran, the latter of which is an epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak — rolled right into global equity markets. European stocks were down 7 percent and have now entered a bear market, and Asian equities were hit hard too, led by a 5 percent decline in Japan.
 The price action also spread to Wall Street. Although trading was halted to prevent a panicked sell-off, the Dow was down nearly 8 percent, as was the broader S&P 500 index. The declines were due in part to the energy sector meltdown, to be sure. But more broadly they reflected the fear, if not likelihood, of a global economic contraction that could rival the Great Recession.
 Policymakers have hopefully learned lessons from that panic. And in fact the Federal Reserve moved Monday to boost short-term lending, and the New York Fed said it would follow suit to mitigate strain on the banking system.
 Much more will be needed...

A shipment of medical aid coming from China has arrived yesterday at Baghdad International Airport in the first foreign initiative to support Iraq in facing the Coronavirus, which has killed four people and infected 54 others who are still receiving medical care in Iraqi hospitals. In light of the escalating needs to confront the virus, the Iraqi Red Crescent Society (IRCS) is intensifying its efforts in the awareness campaigns and the preventive measures and strengthening the capabilities of health institutions in providing medical services to the affected people by supporting the partners in the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement. The President of the IRCS, Dr. Yassin Ahmed Abbas said, "The Chinese Red Cross is always on top to provide assistance to the IRCS, despite the conditions that the Chinese people are going through and the challenges related to confronting the Coronavirus and the great damage it has caused in the number of Chinese cities, but these conditions did not prevent the Chinese Red Cross from extending a helping hand to the Iraqis, this calls for more thanks to these humanitarian positions that strengthen the partnership between the two parts".

MISSOULA, Mont. (AP) — Two women were killed and a man was shot near the western Montana town of Stevensville and the suspect was arrested after a chase that ended in a crash in a yard in Missoula, Ravalli County officials said. Sheriff Steve Holton said his office is investigating Tuesday's shooting as a domestic violence incident and there is evidence the suspect was under the influence of drugs. The injured man gave officers a description of the shooter's vehicle and a Montana Highway Patrol trooper spotted the black Camaro on U.S. Highway 93 in Lolo at about 7 p.m., Holton said. Troopers put out spike strips but the driver avoided them. “The suspect took off and ended up in a pursuit with Missoula County Sheriff’s deputies, Ravalli County Sheriff’s deputies and Missoula Police officers before the suspect wrecked his vehicle in Missoula,\" Holton said. The suspect was arrested at about 8 p.m. and was booked into the Ravalli County jail on suspicion of deliberate homicide, assault with a weapon and criminal endangerment. Holton did not release the names of the victims, who are in their 20s, as is the suspect, Holton said. The injured man is hospitalized in Missoula.

Atletico de Madrid midfielder Thomas Partey has said that it is a dream of his to play at Anfield ahead of their Champions League tie.
 Atleti lead 1-0 from the first leg in the Spanish capital three weeks ago and the tie is on a knife-edge ahead of Wednesday’s second leg in Liverpool.
 Jurgen Klopp’s side remain slight favourites to progress on aggregate but an away goal for Los Rojiblancos would put them in command of the tie and see the hosts need to secure a two-goal winning margin on the night.
 “We are prepared. It is a dream for me to play against them in their stadium. I hope it stays forever in my career,” Partey told reporters at his pre-match press conference, as cited by Marca.
 “They are doing well. We have to be focused one hundred percent. We know it will be difficult.
 “Klopp said not many of us had played at Anfield? For us as players it is important that the teammates help each other. Sometimes opinions are opinions. We are here to do our job.”
 The midfielder also addressed the issue of coronavirus and the fact that all football matches in Spain will be played behind closed doors for the next two weeks, at least.
 There have been multiple calls from clubs and the AFE Spanish players union to postpone matches altogether in this case, but Partey did not agree.
 “We will find out what happens. As a player it is nice to play with fans, but if it is behind closed doors and it helps to lower the risk, we don’t care,” he added.
 “We have to concentrate on our work. The decisions do not depend on the players but the organisers – I will just try to help my team.”
 It follows on from a La Liga statement earlier on Tuesday that all matches in the nation would be played behind closed doors for the next two weeks.
 The league is following protocol from the Spanish Council of Sports that all sporting events – both professional and non-professional – be played behind closed doors.
 It follows similar measures in Italy (where no sport is now being staged due to a lockdown until early April) and France, while measures are in place across a number of other nations.
