 Cherry Hill Courier-Post
 GLOUCESTER TWP. - A Philadelphia man allegedly fled a traffic stop here early Saturday, hitting a policeman with his car door and running over the officer's foot, authorities say.
 Oliver Lee, 20, was arrested after his car broke down about three miles from the scene of the incident, said Gloucester Township police.
 Lee was charged with aggravated assault, resisting arrest and other offenses.
 The officer was struck around 12:45 a.m. when officers stopped Lee's vehicle on Williamstown Road in the Sicklerville area, according to a police account.
 "While speaking with the driver, officers suspected that he was in possession of narcotics or under the influence of narcotics while driving," said the account.
 "As officers attempted to escort him from the vehicle, Mr. Lee placed the vehicle in drive and drove away," it said.
 It said the officer who was hit the fleeing vehicle declined treatment for a minor injury.
 Police alleged Lee's vehicle held suspected marijuana, packaging material and a knife.
 Lee was being held Saturday in Camden County Jail.
