Now, I will again quote the great article NewsLaundy did on me, where they questioned why I used words like 'Ravish's head should be put in a commode and flushed'. The reporter said it was inappropriate, Sekhri shared the story from his handle, must have read and supervised it too (a usual process when you target someone bigger than you). So, where was that gyaan, Jhabra? Did it get lost in your curls? He uses the same argument that the same article quotes from my side where I said that journalists like Ravish are using contextually far worse words than what mine would mean in the literal sense.

The fact is, this is how this gang of thugs with members like Abhinandan Sekhri works. They try to take down everyone who doesn't agree with their view. These lapdogs of AAP and Congress, ideologically aligned to anyone who is anti-BJP, masquerading as 'anti-establishment', are working in cahoots to drum up agenda. Thugs like NewsLaundry CEO Abhinandan Sekhri get wet with the mention of the name 'Arnab'. He couldn't have let it pass because Kamra does 'social commentary' according to Jhabra!

While it's unclear exactly what they're teasing, OnePlus is rumored to have a more affordable phone in the works. The device, possibly called the OnePlus Z, is rumored to launch in India next month and leaks suggest it may feature a Snapdragon 765 processor, 5G support, 6GB of Ram and 128GB of storage. On Friday, Pei tweeted an old promo for the 2014 OnePlus One, leading some to speculate that the OnePlus Z could have the same $299 starting price as the OnePlus One.
 The company released the flagship OnePlus 8 and OnePlus 8 Pro earlier this year. The OnePlus 8 starts at $699 (£599) for 128GB of storage and features 5G, a 90Hz display and strong battery life. The OnePlus 8 Pro takes the specs, and price tag, up a notch, starting at $899 (£799) for 128GB storage.
 OnePlus didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

The recent Supreme Court order that ruled in favour of DoT on its interpretation of AGR asking the industry to pay dues as high as Rs 1.47 lakh cr with VIL to pay an estimated over Rs 53,000 crore which could deal the final knockout blow to the already battered telco. The company having clocked consecutive losses in all quarters since its merger announcement in 2017 reported the highest ever corporate loss in the country at Rs 50,922 cr in Q2 of the current financial year which is over 10 times higher than that of the previous quarter. The mammoth amount came as a result of making room for AGR provisioning of Rs 25,680 cr in relation to the additional statutory dues following the apex court ‘s order.
 Its rival Airtel too listed massive net losses of Rs 23,045 cr in the same quarter- highest ever during its entire tenure on the back of provisioning for its dues in line with Supreme Court’s order. It made an overall provisioning of Rs28,450 crore.Mukesh Ambani-led Jio, which stands better than the incumbents, posted net profits of Rs 990 cr in the September quarter.

CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. (WVIR) - The thought of contracting coronavirus is very scary, but for those living and working in long-term care facilities, the threat is even more daunting. A team of healthcare workers at UVA stepped up and came together to help some of the most vulnerable patients and staff in the Charlottesville and Albemarle County area stay healthy.In early March, doctors and nurses with UVA knew they not only needed to have a COVID-19 game plan in their facilities but also out in the community. That why they created GERI-Pal, the program that is saving the lives of those in long term care facilities.“I think that every facility has responded so amazingly and they’ve worked so hard,” Nurse Practitioner Dr. Kimberly Albero said. “I’m grateful to have been a part of it and be a part of helping them to feel like they have that backing that support.”In order to support the most vulnerable population in the area, UVA put together a powerful team to tackle the challenge. The GERI-Pal team duties included providing PPE, training, support, telemedicine consultations, and many other resources.“Being able to respond to that in a meaningful way and being able to have an impact in ways that are necessary and are important to facilities,” Dr. Laurie Archbald-Pannone said.The first two facilities the team worked with showed lower mortality rates than seen in other outbreaks. The team brought their ideas and experience forward in a paper that was recently published in a medical journal. They hope it can serve as a blueprint for long term care facilities across the globe.“If it can help to show how it can be done and how we really made a difference in this little part of Virginia in our little neck of the woods...I think that is the most meaningful piece of it,” Dr. Albero said.Moving forward, they hope that this initiative will continue to keep folks healthy and safe but also serve as a model for other communities trying to find solutions.Copyright 2020 WVIR.

Africa’s reported cases of COVID-19 have gone above 300,000, showing a quickening pace of the spread of the disease across the continent. According to figures released Monday by the Africa Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the continent now has 306,567 confirmed cases, including 8,115 deaths and 146,212 recoveries. It took more than 90 days for Africa’s 54 countries to reach 100,000 cases, 19 days to reach 200,000 and now 12 days to go above 300,000. The actual number of cases is believed to be much higher, as testing across the continent is low.
