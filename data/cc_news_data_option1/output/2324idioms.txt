MOSCOW (AP) — A Russian court on Monday sentenced an American businessman to 16 years in prison on spying charges, a sentence that he and his brother rejected as being political.The Moscow City Court read out the conviction of Paul Whelan on charges of espionage and sentenced him to 16 years in a maximum security prison colony. The trial was held behind closed doors.Whelan, who was arrested in Moscow in December 2018, has insisted on his innocence, saying he was set up.Speaking after the verdict, U.S. Ambassador John Sullivan denounced the secret trial in which no evidence was produced as an egregious violation of human rights and international legal norms. He described Whelan's conviction as a mockery of justice and demanded his immediate release.Whelan's brother David said lawyers will appeal the verdict that he denounced as political, adding in a statement that “the court’s decision merely completes the final piece of this broken judicial process.”“We had hoped that the court might show some independence but, in the end, Russian judges are political, not legal, entities,” the statement said. “We look to the U.S. government to immediately take steps to bring Paul home.”Whelan, a 50-year-old corporate security executive and Marine Corps veteran from Novi, Michigan, was arrested outside a Moscow hotel. He was in Russia to attend a friend’s wedding at the time.Whelan, who also holds British, Irish and Canadian citizenship, denies the charges of spying for the U.S. that his lawyers said stem from a sting operation. Whelan’s lawyer has said his client was handed a flash drive that had classified information on it that he didn’t know about.Whelan has publicly complained of poor prison conditions in Russia and has said his life is in danger. Last month, Whelan underwent surgery for a hernia.Copyright 2020 Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Let me confess right up front: I've been spoiled.
   
 Every morning for more than 80 years now, the day has dawned, the sun has risen. Some mornings were a bit darker than others, to be sure, but light always has come. Every single day, without exception.
   
 Do the math to figure out how many minutes have ticked on the clock during all those years, and the resulting totals may amaze you. During all those minutes my heart has pumped and my lungs have inflated. They just keep doing it. Without fail. And most of the time I've just taken it for granted. I'm spoiled.
   
 All of the days in all of those years I have been surrounded by loving family members and by a host of friends. And at least partly because of those dear people, I've always had food for my belly, clothes on my back, and a roof over my head. Always. I can't imagine having to sleep on a sidewalk or in a homeless camp. I don't live in that world. I've been spoiled.
   
 How often do you pause to say "Thank You" to the good Lord who keeps the earth spinning and the seasons rotating and the seeds germinating to provide us a lush, dependable ecosphere to exist in?
   
 When you go through the daily routines of putting on your socks or picking up your glasses or taking your meds, do you ever stop to realize how many inhabitants of this planet can't do that? Does it ever occur to you just how spoiled we are? And it's all because of the goodness of our God. Our heavenly Father loves to spoil us.
   
 When the apostle Paul wanted to identify his God to the pagans in Lystra, he pointed out blessings like these I've just mentioned. "He has shown kindness by giving you rain from heaven and crops in their seasons," he told them. "He provides you with plenty of food and fills your hearts with joy."
   
 Most of us can testify along with the inhabitants of ancient Jerusalem, "We have had enough to eat and plenty to spare, because the Lord has blessed his people." In fact, some of us can confess that we've had more than enough to eat. We've been spoiled.
   
 Far more vital to us than God's physical blessings, of course, are the spiritual ones. Paul expressed his gratitude for "God's abundant provision of grace and of the gift of righteousness" that we receive through Jesus.
   
 "The Lord is good to all," the psalmist sang. "He has compassion on all he has made."
   
 How blessed we are that he spoils us.

County officials said they’re willing and able to handle Hempstead’s vouchers, too, and Nassau is committed to the program, but the county will need support. It’ll be important for the state to make sure the transition goes smoothly, that Nassau has the capacity and staff to handle Hempstead’s vouchers, and that landlords are on board. The town can issue more than 400 vouchers, but only 143 are in use now. That has to change.

Bloomberg) -- While Christopher Wray’s boss, Attorney General William Barr, stood in front of the White House on live TV this month making sure federal officers followed orders to push back demonstrators, the FBI director was doing his job far from the cameras.
 Working behind the scenes, Wray helped set up a command center at the FBI’s Washington field office to coordinate the federal response to protests after George Floyd’s death at the hands of Minneapolis police. He communicated with command centers in the bureau’s 56 field office across the country and put the FBI’s elite tactical Hostage Rescue team on standby in Washington.
 Wray’s no-nonsense approach may be the reason he’s survived this long under a president who’s effectively kept him on permanent probation. His handling of the days of unrest is emblematic of his leadership style since taking over the embattled Federal Bureau of Investigation in August 2017, according to current and former law enforcement officials.
 “The director has, from the beginning, been focused on the mission that the FBI has,” said Brian O’Hare, an FBI agent and president of the FBI Agents Association. “He has reminded us on a regular basis to keep your nose to the grindstone, do your work for the American people and uphold the Constitution.”
 President Donald Trump chose Wray after firing FBI Director James Comey over his investigation into Russia’s interference in the 2016 election. Along with Secretary of State Michael Pompeo, who initially led the CIA, Wray is among the administration’s longest-serving senior national security officials.
 ‘Jury’s Still Out’
 With Trump that could change at any time, as the president never seems far from shaking up any agency that draws his ire. “Let’s see what happens with him,” Trump said of Wray during a May 8 interview on “Fox & Friends.” Then he added, “Look, the jury’s still out.”
 And now Wray, 53, faces a new challenge. As the next presidential election approaches, he’s confronting sprawling Republican-led inquiries into actions by FBI officials early in their investigation of whether anyone close to Trump colluded in Russia’s meddling. Barr has ordered a criminal probe into whether illegal acts were committed by the investigators.
 Unlike four years ago, when the FBI played a visible and controversial role heading into the election, Wray is determined to keep the bureau from becoming a distraction and focused instead on its core responsibilities, according to a senior bureau official. That includes disrupting terrorist plots and investigating crimes, including federal civil rights violations.
 Republican Critics
 Wray wasn’t at the FBI when the Russia investigation began in 2016 -- the former assistant attorney general was in private practice until Trump made him FBI director. By the time he took over the bureau, the probe was in the hands of Special Counsel Robert Mueller. Yet Republican critics say Wray hasn’t done enough to root out and punish wrongdoing in the FBI’s ranks.
 “In fact, he’s done nothing, the current FBI director, to address the situation,” Republican Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri said at a June 4 hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
 Actually, Wray ordered 40 corrective steps after the Justice Department’s inspector general found multiple significant errors when the FBI submitted applications to wiretap former Trump campaign aide Carter Page in 2016 and 2017. Last month, Wray ordered an internal review into how the FBI handled the investigation into Trump’s former national security adviser, Michael Flynn. He also brought in a new leadership team for the bureau.
 Republican Probe
 The Republican-controlled Judiciary panel voted Thursday to give its chairman sweeping authority to subpoena former Obama administration officials but also Barr and Wray.
 “Director Wray remains firmly committed to addressing the failures under prior FBI leadership while maintaining the foundational principles of rigor, objectivity, accountability, and ownership in fulfilling the Bureau’s mission to protect the American people and defend the Constitution,” the bureau said in a May 5 statement.
 The FBI also is under pressure to play a role in a national push to restrict police abuses and to deliver on the assertion -- voiced by Trump, Barr and Wray with little evidence to back it up -- that “antifa” anarchists fomented violence in protests.
 The FBI and Justice Department are conducting an investigation to determine whether any federal civil rights laws were violated in connection with Floyd’s death.
 ‘Real Deal’
 “I can’t imagine a more intense time or difficult time for the FBI,” said Nancy Savage, a former FBI official who’s now executive director of the Society of Former Special Agents of the FBI, She said of Wray, “Overwhelmingly he’s the real deal. He’s quiet, but he’s super-confident. He’s not one to grandstand. He just gets the job done.”
 O’Hare said Wray has the full confidence and support of the FBI Agents Association, which advocates for more than 14,000 active and former special agents.
 Under Wray, the rate at which special agents voluntarily leave the bureau is low while more applicants are applying for the job. In fiscal year 2019, fewer than 1% of special agents voluntarily resigned, and that’s expected to remain the case for fiscal year 2020, according to bureau statistics. Almost 37,000 applications to become special agents are expected, about 2,000 more than in 2019.
 Barr’s Backing
 Despite Trump’s ambivalence, Barr, a favorite of the president, has repeatedly offered public support for Wray as other conservatives clamor for his removal.
 “This is the FBI that I’ve had the pleasure of working with over the last few days,” Barr said during a June 4 news conference on the federal response to the protests. “The FBI that I know and love, that have really stood up here and performed magnificently, not only here in D.C. but around the country in all their field offices.”
 Wray saw the event as an opportunity to explain what the FBI does and to offer conciliatory words.
 “This is about all of those over the years who have been unjustifiably killed or had their rights violated by people entrusted with their protection,” Wray said. “When we lose sight of those solemn obligations to the citizens we serve, the protectors can quickly become the oppressors, particularly for communities of color.”
 Wray is now having serious discussions to define the FBI’s role in police reform efforts, according to the bureau official. The director held a call on June 5 with the Congressional Black Caucus, which said in a statement that Wray “discussed the FBI’s work to investigate cases which hold officers accountable and offer training.”
 Unlike other political appointees, the director of the FBI is supposed to have a 10-year term, which is intended to help insulate the position from politics and elections. Trump fired Comey in the middle of his term, claiming he could no longer effectively lead the bureau.
 “We never paid attention to elections because it’s a tenured term,” said Savage, the former FBI official. She said Wray is “just going to do the job he essentially has been appointed to do, and everything else is going to happen outside of his control.”

J.K. Rowling: Harry Potter author under fire for trans comments


--DocBreak--
This is an editorial from the Savannah Morning News.
   
 As state lawmakers packed for their return to the Georgia Capitol, they no doubt stuffed some cutting tools into their luggage and car trunks.
   
 Some brought scalpels; others chainsaws.
   
 Here's hoping enough legislators smuggle in logic and reason as well.
   
 The Georgia General Assembly's top priority upon resumption of the 2020 legislative session is to pass a budget for the next fiscal year, which starts July 1. The COVID-19 pandemic has turned the proposed budget, passed by the Georgia House in March and based on pre-coronavirus revenue projections, into scrap paper.
   
 The latest outlook shows a $3 billion shortfall. All indications are the Legislature's budget wonks intend to fill that hole by gutting state agencies across the board -- with no exceptions. The Department of Public Health and Department of Labor, two agencies feeling profound coronavirus-related strain, face 11% cuts. So does K-12 education and the university system.
   
 The plan calls for hiring freezes; reduced support for select programs and grants; the shuttering of offices and other facilities; and furloughs, furloughs and more furloughs.
   
 Leaning government sounds like a prudent approach in this situation. But there's a fine line between lean and frail, and these sorts of cuts threaten to put Georgians at risk. A coalition of 30-plus Georgia business and nonprofit organizations voiced those concerns in a letter to Gov. Brian Kemp and legislators last week.
   
 "Georgia cannot cut its way to prosperity: that much has been made clear in the aftermath of the Great Recession and in the midst of the global pandemic," the letter stated. "Deep cuts will disproportionately harm communities of color and rural communities and curb the state's ability to recover."
   
 Better, then, to consider a more holistic strategy. Georgia House Speaker David Ralston is right when he says, "An economic recession is not the time to ask people to give the state more money." An income tax hike is untenable.
   
 State legislators could instead impose new or expanded sin taxes on cigarettes, vaping products and online sports betting. Georgia's cigarette tax is among the lowest in the country, and the state doesn't collect a tariff on vaping goods. Online sports betting would have to be legalized before the state could tax it, but unlike other forms of gambling, the Legislature could take action without a voter referendum, or so some legal experts believe.
   
 Lawmakers could also roll back some of the state's more lucrative tax breaks used to lure new business, even if only temporarily. Then there's a loophole in the state tax code that allows some high-wealth taxpayers who itemize to pay less on their income taxes.
   
 From there, the budget writers could re-evaluate agency cuts and also consider tapping the rainy-day fund. Don't drain the reserve, but do dip into it. It is raining, after all.
   
 Other innovative solutions are waiting to be discovered as well. The remaining 11 days of the session are the perfect time for state legislators to demonstrate their leadership and ingenuity.
   
 Georgians will be watching. And remember, this is an election year.

Bloomberg) -- Forest destruction is responsible for 10% of human carbon dioxide emissions, and much of it is the result of extreme poverty. For local communities, selling timber and clearing land for cultivation is an income stream of last resort. Researchers, governments, and non-governmental organizations have debated for years how to rid the world of these twin scourges. But which comes first, alleviating the poverty or saving the trees?
 Data from an Indonesian anti-poverty program that began in 2007 provided researchers a natural way to answer that question. The result: Cash payments to people in impoverished areas led to a 30% drop in tree loss, even though the payments came with no conservation conditions.
 “Conservationists don’t have to see this as a zero-sum game—that if the money goes to poverty, it’s not helping the environment,” says Paul Ferraro, a Bloomberg Distinguished Professor at Johns Hopkins University’s Carey Business School and the study’s co-author. (While Michael R. Bloomberg, the founder and majority owner of Bloomberg LP, endowed the research chair, neither Ferraro nor any of the other Bloomberg Distinguished Professors coordinates with Bloomberg or Bloomberg Philanthropies.) “For years, these two camps have been at loggerheads, anti-poverty and the environmental protection camp.”
 Indonesia’s Program Keluarga Harapan, or Family Hopes Program, promises six years of quarterly payments as long as recipients register with local health and education institutions and ensure that pregnant women and children receive exams and vaccines. Children must also attend school.
 While the relationship between anti-poverty and conservation measures is poorly understood, past conservation efforts have had unforeseen or undesirable social impacts, and community-driven deforestation drives have achieved mixed results. Research efforts have more commonly looked at the effects of healthy forestry on well-being, not the other way around, note Ferraro and co-author Rhita Simorangkir, an economics researcher at the National University of Singapore.
 Even more surprising than the result itself, says Ferraro, is that the drop in deforestation seen in Indonesia was about the same as those achieved by policies in other countries designed specifically for conservation. The paper doesn’t advocate for reallocating conservation payments to anti-poverty programs or vice versa, and while Ferraro says he’s encouraged by the results, he also cautions against reading too much into them.
 “This is always the issue of single-country studies,” he says. “They’re more credible than all these global studies that just look at patterns in global data, but they have less ability to generalize, so it’s still unclear.”
 Kira Sullivan-Wiley, a post-doctoral researcher at Boston University who specializes in conservation and human behavior, says the study is “a very tidy and thorough analysis.” She credits the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, an ambitious program to attack the world’s ills by 2030, with drawing anti-poverty and environmental advocates closer together. Solid results showing that an anti-poverty measure has forestry benefits “will please a lot of people who care about both,” Sullivan-Wiley says.
 Indonesia has made significant progress fighting forest loss through targeted programs, as well. Primary forest loss fell by 60% in 2016 due to stepped-up policies and enforcement, and the years since have sustained those gains. It’s a part of a broader strategy for the country to moor its development to a realistic and practical relationship with its environment, says Minister of Finance Sri Mulyani Indrawati.
 “What this pandemic has shown us in such a terrifying way is that we need to rebuild our economies, so they provide us with not only jobs but also a society that is secure, resilient and safe,” Indrawati says. “We can no longer built our economies—our societies—in a way that too often ignores natural science and our dependence on the natural environment.”
 Yet she also warns there’s a danger that the challenge of climate change could be put to aside if it appears to clash with short-run political and economic objectives. Economic pain from the pandemic now threatens poverty-relief efforts that Indonesia has carried out for more than a decade. At the end of March, President Joko Widodo signed into law a stimulus program that includes further relief for the 10 million households in the Family Hope Program.
 It’s too soon to tell whether today’s hardships will lead to further deforestation. Temporary cash transfers and forest-friendly job creation can help reduce the need for people to revert to deforestation if they take a financial hit from the pandemic, says Frances Seymour, distinguished senior fellow at the World Resources Institute. “We need to distinguish between crackdowns on organized crime and appropriate actions to address exploitation of forests by people made desperate by the economic crisis,’’ she says.

Kenya: Odinga Takes COVID-19 Test, Urges Kenyans to Follow Suit


--DocBreak--
As the area makes transition to the new normal because of the COVID-19 pandemic, some of the ways arts are presented to the community will have to change for the time being to continue precautionary measures.
   
 Over the past week, Lone Star Ballet has once again started to host classes back at their studio, located at 3218 Hobbs Road. But because of those precautionary measures, those classes will not be the same as before, at least for the immediate future.
   
 Roxann Seaton, the ballet's newly appointed academy director, said the ballet will be following guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for classes, including six feet of social distancing, instructors wearing masks and making a point to sanitize hands frequently.
   
 Even the way the classes are approached will change, Seaton said, including not being able to manipulate the students' body movements during classes.
   
 "That's something we do. We manipulate their bodies to do certain things and to get them to feel something, but we can't do that right now," she said. "It is now more so that we have to show them what we want and try and explain as best as we can to get them to understand what we are wanting, what we want them to feel … It is a very unique experience, something that we aren't used to."
   
 Class size will also have to be limited to abide by social distancing guidelines. Because of this, Seaton said along with the in-person classes, Lone Star Ballet is also offering classes via Google Meets to supplement in- person instruction.
   
 "So, say the class is a Monday/Wednesday ballet class," she said. "We've asked that they only register for one day, and then if they want to do the second day, they do the Google Meets, therefore everyone who would want to register has that opportunity to register and be in the classroom setting instead of having to be at home or … not giving everybody the chance."
   
 Lone Star Ballet has implemented video instruction throughout the span of the pandemic, giving the chance for its dancers to continue to develop their skills while not being in person.
   
 As an instructor as well as a member of the ballet's professional company, Emily Wallace said the videos prepared her a great deal for coming back to the studio.
   
 "By using those videos, it helped us stay in contact with everyone and just keep that line of communication, just something, not even so much dancing, but to keep in contact," she said. "But as far as how the dancing went, it was helpful to see other people still dancing … Being able to dance in my bedroom, still, was weird, but when I came back here and I was doing stuff, it wasn't as bad. I contribute that a lot to muscle memory, but it was easier I think than it would have been if I just had completely stopped everything."
   
 The goal for the videos, as well as for the first weeks of classes as Lone Star Ballet gets back into their routine, is to get everyone back into shape and correct any wrong habits some may have developed while learning at home, Seaton said.
   
 As Lone Star Ballet looks to the fall, Seaton said she hopes the studio will look more like it did prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.
   
 "We are hoping that by the time we get to auditions in August and start in September that everything will be back to where we can have our full class," she sad. "We can go about life as normal … but with hopes we can actually increase our class sizes and go back to having our 20 kids in a studio, if need be."
   
 Being back in the studio has been a welcome change for Wallace, she said.
   
 "It's been very strange. It's been great to be back, though," she said. "Just to see people alone has been, you know, refreshing. Because I have been in my house for too long. It's been great. The soreness is still a thing, but it's good to be back and see people and interact with everybody."
   
 Wallace said during this pandemic, Lone Star Ballet has shown perseverance, continuing instruction any way they could to provide the art form for anyone who needed it. While it was a struggle at first for her, Wallace now has a stronger drive to use her art form and help teach others that art form.
   
 "It's all I have ever really done all my life, and now, at the very beginning, it was kind of snatched from me," she said. "As the videos came out and I was starting to communicate back with my dancers and see them dancing and interacting with them, it kind of reignited everything, almost like a jump- start, if you will. … I think the hunger for dancing now is a lot stronger than it was before."

GULFPORT, Miss. (AP) — Tropical Storm Cristobal left a big mess on beaches along the Mississippi Gulf Coast, but that created an opportunity for the Mississippi Aquarium. The Gulfport facility plans to recycle driftwood left by the recent storm, WLOX-TV reported. With permission from Harrison County Sand Beach Authority, aquarium staffers have been gathering pieces that will become part of the habitats at the aquarium still under construction in Gulfport. “They’re very beautiful. They’re going to look great in our exhibits,” said Alison Goetz, one of the aquarium’s animal care specialists who worked to move a huge section of wood from the beach to a trailer. The aquarium was originally scheduled to open in April, but the cornavirus pandemic has an indefinite delay on those plans.

Faulty software or poorly calibrated vote-tabulation scanners used to count mailed-in ballots in this week's chaotic Georgia primary may have prevented thousands of votes from being counted, election officials and voting integrity activists say.
   
 The issue was identified in at least four counties, DeKalb, Morgan, Clarke and Cherokee, according to officials who discovered them, including activists who have sued the state for alleged election mismanagement.
   
 "The fact that it is in multiple counties tells me that it's probably systemic," Richard DeMillo, a Georgia Tech computer scientist who has testified for the plaintiffs, because identical scanners and software were used to count all absentee ballots across the state. DeMillo said the only way to know for sure is through audits.
   
 A top Georgia voting official, voting implementation manager Gabriel Sterling, said Friday that he had seen no evidence yet of the issue and found it difficult to believe the reports were "an active description of what is happening on the ground."
   
 "These are activists who have an ax to grind," he said.
   
 Nearly 1.1 million Georgians voted by mail for Tuesday's primary, which had been delayed twice due to the coronavirus pandemic.
   
 In-person voting Tuesday was beset by cascading failures. Voters waited up to five hours to cast ballots at some polling places due to equipment problems, poll worker unfamiliarity with a new voting system and social distancing measures taken because of the virus. Many voters also showed up to vote in person because absentee ballots they requested never arrived by mail.
   
 The scanners and ballot-marking devices used in all 159 Georgia counties Tuesday are part of a voting equipment package the state purchased for $120 million from Dominion Voting Systems after a federal judge ordered it to scrap an outdated, untrustworthy system.
   
 In post-election reviews Wednesday, election panels in all four counties detected unregistered votes while examining ballot images flagged by the vote- tallying scanner's software for anomalies.
   
 In Morgan County, Republican-dominated and just southeast of Atlanta, panelists discovered at least 20 votes on scanned ballot images that the program had not recorded, said Jeanne Dufort, a Democrat on the panel. She said it appeared the votes did not register because ovals that were supposed to be filled in were instead checked or marked with X's.
   
 All three panelists agreed to add the unregistered votes to the electronic tally, said Dufort. But on Thursday, the county elections board voted 3-2 not to audit the rest of the roughly 3,000 absentee ballots. The other two panelists, both Republicans, did not return emails and phone calls seeking comment.
   
 "It is a head-in-the-sand approach," Dufort complained.
   
 In Clarke County, vote review panelist Adam Shirley estimated at least 30 ballots out of about 300 flagged for anomalies had votes that "the system had not marked at all, that had not processed at all."
   
 Shirley, a Democrat, recommended a review of all 15,000 absentee ballots.
   
 In an email Friday to fellow board members, county election board chair Jesse Evans said "it's not just possible but probable that a ballot whose voter had clearly but not completely marked their vote would not have its votes counted by the software."
   
 In an email to Evans, Shirley said he found it disturbing that the software did not flag the uncounted votes. "We only noticed them by sheer luck as we were adjudicating other, flagged contests on ballots."
   
 In Cherokee County, the problem was detected in less than 5% of the flagged ballots, said an elections official who spoke on condition they not be further identified, citing fear of political harassment. The official said the number of flagged ballots was in the hundreds.
   
 In DeKalb, County, review panel member Elizabeth Burns estimated finding between 20-50 uncounted votes on 530 flagged ballots and said her team had so far only reviewed half its 100,000 absentee ballots. Like Shirley, she said her team had stumbled upon the issue. She said she wondered if other counties were even aware of it.
   
 "Maybe not everyone has been as thorough as us and noticed this," she said.
   
 "The detection of this major problem was only because of diligent citizen oversight. The officials charged with the duty to fully test the equipment recklessly failed to responsibly do so, or to audit it," said Marilyn Marks, executive director of the Coalition for Good Governance, which is demanding in court that the state scrap the ballot-marking devices.
   
 Dominion spokeswoman Kay Stimson referred questions to the state, but said in an email that her company's systems "are designed to support robust post- election audits, and we support them as a recommended best practice for elections."
   
 Sterling, the state official, said authorities are willing to consider audits if merited.
   
 Voting security expert Harri Hursti said inadequate pre-election testing may be the cause of the issue. A fix could be as simple as adjusting the contrast settings in the image-capturing software. Or it could be a different coding issue.
   
 The Dominion election system used on Tuesday is proprietary. Hursti said it has never been subjected to an independent security review.
   
 It was, however, denied certification by Texas, which cited "multiple hardware and software issues" identified by state-appointed examiners. They cited a complex installation process and one called the suite "fragile and error prone."

This column is presented as a public service.
   
 A few days ago, Greg Glassman, the founder and CEO of CrossFit, set off an uproar by belittling the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police. In a Zoom call with gym owners, he bristled at the idea of memorializing a man whose killing outraged the nation and the world.
   
 "We're not mourning for George Floyd," he said. "I don't think me or any of my staff are. Can you tell me why I should mourn for him? Other than, it's the 'white' thing to do?"
   
 Then he took his scorn public with a flippant retort to a tweet calling racism and discrimination "critical public health issues." Replied Glassman, "It's FLOYD-19." The social media backlash was furious, and Glassman issued a statement, saying he was "deeply saddened" by the pain he caused. "It was a mistake," he insisted, "not racist but a mistake." By Tuesday, according to the New York Times, nearly 1,200 gyms had decided to disaffiliate from CrossFit, and its founder was stepping down.
   
 That said, we aren't here today to bury Greg Glassman. He's done an effective job of that on his own.
   
 No, this is for the next Greg Glassman, the next white person who finds himself excoriated for saying or doing some racially offensive thing. It is to beg that unlucky individual to not compound the transgression by retreating as Glassman did to the cliche of cliches, the one that makes folks sigh and roll their eyes, that signals like a neon flasher you are not to be taken seriously. Don't say what Michael Richards said after he threatened to lynch a black heckler, what Amy Cooper said after she called 911 on a black man birdwatching in Central Park, what Roseanne Barr said after likening a black woman to an ape, what white folks always say when caught with their hands in this particular cookie jar.
   
 For the love of Heaven, please don't say, "I am not a racist."
   
 So what should that person say instead? Glad you asked. Here's a template for future apologies:
   
 "I am profoundly sorry for what I said or did. I apologize to the people I hurt. There is no excuse.
   
 "I won't insult your intelligence by saying 'I am not a racist' because I know I am. As a white person in a society where every institution is geared to advantage people like me, it is literally impossible for me to be anything else. In that, I am like a man in a male-dominated society. He cannot help being sexist, his good intentions notwithstanding. Saying he's not sexist is like a fish saying he's not wet.
   
 "Many of us as white people struggle with that. That's because we process racism as a loathsome character defect, when really, it's the water in which we swim.
   
 "No, the question is not whether we are racist, but what kind of racist we will be. Will we be the overt kind, whose behavior marks her from a mile away? In many ways, her very obviousness makes her the least dangerous.
   
 "Will we be the racist in denial, who thinks that because he doesn't use racial slurs and eats lunch with a black guy at work, he's all good? He's ultimately the most dangerous, because his racism is reflected in implicit bias but otherwise hidden, even from himself.
   
 "Or will we be the racist in remission who knows good intentions are not enough, that he must consciously commit not simply to being non-racist, but actively anti-racist?
   
 "That's what I aspire to and what I hope I achieve more often than not. But when I said or did the offending thing, I fell short. That doesn't reflect my intentions or my best self. So I ask your forgiveness.
   
 "Like all of us, I'm only human. I will try to do better next time."

 Mental health rates in Texas were staggering before the global COVID-19 outbreak, with approximately one in five adult Texans experiencing a mental health concern annually.
   
 With the upending of routines, fear of the virus, anxiety around economic uncertainties, the new norm of social distancing and increased isolation, the COVID-19 crisis is making those living with existing mental health conditions especially vulnerable and is causing a rise in new mental health disorders in Texans.
   
 National Alliance on Mental Illness Texas has seen a 500% increase in calls from people asking for help in the past month, and the National Association of Social Workers - Texas Chapter reports an increase in providers utilizing telehealth services to provide support to as many Texans as safely as possible.
   
 Now more than ever, it is imperative that organizations, businesses and community members across the country join the movement to raise awareness about mental health, understand the warning signs, fight stigma, provide support through local events and screenings, and advocate for policies that support people with mental illness and their families.
   
 A silver lining to the coronavirus crisis is that the treatment of mental health has been forced to evolve quickly, enabling increased access to doctors through telemedicine and mental health providers through telehealth and addressing what was, in some localities, a shortage of in-person mental health care. Many employers are recognizing the toll on their employees and are expanding their mental health benefits for therapy, and, in some cases, access to medications for addiction treatment, such as medication assisted treatment, have been made easier during this time.
   
 Federal funding is also playing a key role, with Gov. Greg Abbott recently announcing the state had received $5.8 million for mental health professionals like social workers to provide counseling services to Texans impacted by COVID-19. These dollars are vital, as the World Health Organization found that for every dollar spent scaling up treatment for common mental health conditions, a $4 return can be realized in improved health and productivity.
   
 The society that emerges from the pandemic will look different in many ways, with personal and community safety concerns lingering, as well as questions around how telemedicine and telehealth services will evolve. With so many Texans navigating challenges, it's crucial for the state to be prepared for a continued increase of mental health cases in the coming months.
   
 The Texas Legislature will undoubtedly address mental health and the difficulties caused by COVID-19 when it convenes for the 87th Legislative Session early next year. Mental wellbeing is fundamental to overall health, and state leaders should enact policies that allow for the continued expansion of mental health treatments. This includes ensuring access to telemedicine and telehealth at parity with in-person care and exploring the implementation of universal mental health screenings at schools and in primary healthcare settings.
   
 The COVID-19 pandemic is further demonstrating that the world needs biopharmaceutical innovation to address pressing global health challenges both now and in the future. While the biopharmaceutical industry is working around the clock for a vaccine for COVID-19, it is also critical that researchers continue to focus on bringing new and promising treatments to improve mental health. Today, there are more than 140 medicines in development for mental illness. These expanded treatment options improve adherence and control over mental health diseases, as well as quality of life.
   
 Thanks to a broad continuum of services that includes everything from therapy to medication, Texans will have a wide array of support to help them as they move through the pandemic and back into their communities. Scientific growth and biopharmaceutical innovation are taking place in conjunction with other mental health interventions, and we will need a wide array of resources to combat these alarming statistics and come out of the COVID-19 pandemic prepared and stronger than ever.

Turning into a monster in 8th season (finale) vanished her success. Banished her image. It wasn’t expected from a leader who got honour and respect through the kind way adopted throughout.
