The proposed re-match between undefeated world champion Katie Taylor and former title holder Delfine Persoon is in jeopardy. It had been anticipated that the Taylor v Persoon II showdown would be officially announced by Matchroom boss Eddie Hearn tonight.However Persoon's partner, manager and trainer Filiep Tampere has revealed that the deal for the August 22nd bout has fallen through.&quot;We had a deal, but now we don't have a deal and Delfine will not be fighting Katie Taylor,&quot; he told Independent.ie.&quot;Eddie Hearn is a very difficult man to deal with it. He keeps changing what we had agreed. Delfine has said enough is enough.&quot;Katie Taylor needs this fight more than Delfine. She has a full- time job. She can work seven days a week.&quot;He confirmed that Matchroom had made three offers to him to entice Pearson to take on Taylor in the world title contest to be staged without an audience on Hearn's estate in Essex. They were willing to accept a reduced purse because there would be no ticket sales.Tampere said the contract remained unsigned because of the last minute changes. &quot;So at the moment there is no fight.&quot;He declined to elaborate on what conditions Hearn wanted to change or whether they related to demands by the Taylor camp that both boxers sign up to a drug testing regime ahead of the showdown.It remains to be seen whether the fight can be rescued at the eleventh hour. Hearn is a renowned deal maker and he can ill-afford to lose a second high-profile opponent.Originally, nine-belt and seven-weight world champion Amanda Serrano was to be Taylor's opponent in Manchester last May but the Covid-19 pandemic resulted in the postponement of the fight on two occasions.Amid much acrimony Serrano eventually pulled out of the August 22nd bout and there is no chance of it being revived.&quot;It's not happening on August 22,&quot; said her US based promoter Lou DiBella. &quot;There are no boxing gyms open or sparring in New York. Covid-19 is out of control in most states. She (Amanda) is not flying commercially at this time, across the ocean, to fight in Katie's promoter's back yard.&quot;The original Taylor v Serrano fight would have been the most lucrative in the history of women's professional fighting with the Bray pugilist expected to earn in the region of €1.3m, including a portion of the UK pay-per view rights. Serrano was due to pick up a cheque for an estimated €300,000.Though the purses would be reduced for the behind closed doors fight, Taylor would still be expected to earn the first-ever seven-figure sum in women'boxing.With so much at stake there are likely to last-minute efforts to resolve the contract issues between the two camps and the promoter.During this tiresome saga, Taylor has been training in her base in Connecticut in the United States. She hasn't been home since late January.When Eddie Hearn tweeted earlier this week that the Taylor v Persoon fight was a runner, Taylor – who turned 34 earlier this month - commented 'Let's go'.But for the moment at least it looks like she will be let down for the second time in a month.In the event of Persoon sticking by her guns and declining the rematch, Hearn may recruit veteran Spanish lightweight Miriam Gutierrez for the August 22 fight card show.The 37-year-old, who only turned professional in 2017, is unbeaten in her 13 fights and is the current WBA interim world champion and as such in entitled to get a shot against Taylor. But in terms of appeal she rates a poor third behind Serrano and Persoon.

 I am committed to empowering all children to lead healthy and active lives through effective health and physical education programs -- do the education leaders in our state feel the same way? In December of 2015, President Obama signed the new bipartisan federal education legislation into law, the Every Student Succeeds Act . For the first time, health and physical education were recognized as a critical component of a student's well-rounded education. These subjects should play an integral role in the educational experience of all students.   Thanks to the inclusion and elevation of health and physical education within ESSA, we have the opportunity to get all students healthy and active. As our education leaders begin to develop an ESSA implementation plan and set education priorities, I urge our leaders to ensure that health and physical education are made a priority for students. As part of a well-rounded education, health and physical education programs can now be supported by funding allocated for Title I (low socioeconomic status schools), Title II (professional development) and Title IV (safe and healthy students). This funding could provide the boost that these programs need to impact the health of students in the long term.   After the passage of No Child Left Behind 15 years ago, we witnessed two alarming and most likely related trends. Health and physical education were too often considered ancillary subjects and therefore the first to be cut in state education budget shortfalls. In addition, child obesity rates reached epidemic proportions, with 1 in 3 children ages 10-17 either overweight or obese.   Research has shown that participating in physical activity and physical education improves student attendance, test scores, participation and enthusiasm for other academic subjects, motivation to learn, and reduces discipline referrals. Evidence also shows that effective school health education reduces student participation in behaviors such as smoking, heavy drinking, school misbehavior and violence.   Now that health and physical education have been prioritized in ESSA as part of a student's well-rounded education and are allowable uses of federal education funding, I believe it's vital that health and physical education become a priority for all students as we work to take a new approach to educating our students. I look forward to the future of health and physical education for our students!   Stacey Signorino   Rochester

The DIRTcar Summit Racing Equipment Modified Nationals tour sets sail on a milestone season Wednesday night, celebrating 10 consecutive years of competition and partnership with Summit Racing Equipment. Just three different drivers have hoisted the coveted championship trophy over the nine completed seasons. Mike Harrison stands atop all drivers with six championships to his name and 49 Feature victories; Nick Hoffman is the two- time and defending Nationals champion with 26 total wins; Kenny Wallace is the 2012 tour champion and has collected seven Nationals victories in his career. The great relationship shared between DIRTcar Racing and Summit was established in 2011 and has since seen the Modified Nationals blossom into one of the most competitive UMP Modified tours in the Midwest. As they enter their 10th year of title sponsorship, the staff at Summit could not be prouder to finally see the racing season kick off with the opener at Brownstown Speedway on July 8. “Summit Racing Equipment is proud to be a part of the DIRTcar family and it has been exciting to watch the series become one of the most prestigious Modified tours in the country,” said Summit Motorsports & Events Manager Jim Greenleaf. “None of this would be possible without the support of all the great Modified drivers that have taken part in the series, including our champions. We look forward to an exciting 10th year and crowning the champion.” As enjoyable as it’s been for Summit to see the tour grow over the past 10 years, it’s been just as exciting for the drivers to compete in every summer, night-in and night-out. Wallace often looks back on his championship- winning season with lots of fond memories of the road, his crew and the two nights he visited Victory Lane that year. “It is, by far, my most memorable year in dirt,” Wallace said. “2012 is my favorite year in dirt racing. It was a really fun year, had a good crew. I had a lot of people, a consistent team. Everyone did their jobs, everybody was gelling, nobody was married, nobody had kids. It was really fun.” Many fans know him from his time spent on NASCAR television broadcasts, but in recent years, Twitter has been The Herminator’s platform of choice for his positive, silly and often times inspirational videos taken with his phone. His plentiful fanbase has been enjoying them ever since he returned to the DIRTcar circuit, and they’ve become one of his favorite pastimes on the road. “2012 was the year where my team was playing along and doing the videos with me. We really enjoyed stopping at all the truck stops, grabbing the Steak N Shake at two in the morning. I think, personally, that’s what stands out to me,” Wallace said. As an established UMP Modified veteran, Harrison knows what it means to have such a great relationship with sponsors like Summit and has always had the upmost pride in racing under the Summit banner. “Summit really stuck their neck out for us 10 years ago and did this whole deal,” Harrison said. “Having somebody like that come aboard and do something for us, and allow us to go race far, it’s great. “I’ve carried the Summit banner on my car ever since they started. I truly feel that I owe that to them, just for what they have done for us. I make sure, every year, that I have the proper Summit decals on my car, not just during the Summer Nationals.” The defending champion also has a lot of appreciation for Summit’s support over the years. “It’s pretty cool that they do this for us. They also help out with the Mod Mania deal at Tri-City [IL]. So, they’ve done a lot for us Modified guys. It’s definitely a working-man’s tour for us,” Hoffman said. Coming off one of the best years of his career, Hoffman is set to defend his crown this season on the back of another DIRTcar Nationals crowning in February. He’ll be aboard NASCAR veteran Justin Allgaier’s #7 Elite Chassis for the first half of this year’s tour, looking for the same tenacity he displayed in 2019 with 12 Feature wins. “I’m one of the lucky ones – I’m able to drive racecars for a living, and I also own my chassis company. So, I’ll have stuff getting done here while I’m on the road. But right now, I feel like I’m in my prime age of racing and need to get it done while I can,” Hoffman said.

FENNVILLE -- After nearly nine years in business, Hop N Pizza and Grinders in Fennville will be closing its doors on Friday, July 10.
   
 The business has been up for sale for over a year, owner Linda De Jonge Barnes said and recently found a buyer.
   
 The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic did not have an impact on closing the business, she said.
   
 "I've had it up for sale for a year-and-a-half," De Jonge Barnes said. "I'll be 65 in January; I want a less stressful job.
   
 "It's going to be the people (that I miss). My employees, the community that comes in. Everyone is sorry to see me leave, but they can understand."
   
 De Jonge Barnes said her business, which opened in September 2011, will be replaced with an El Rancho restaurant, which has two locations in Holland -- one on Riley Street and one on 16th Street.
   
 Although the restaurant will close July 10, a silent auction will be held for some of the merchandise hanging on the walls. It will take place at noon Saturday, July 25, at HopN.
   
 "A lot of people want the beer signs," De Jonge Barnes said. "We'll hold a silent auction at noon. That way, they can try to get the ones they want."
   
 Hop N announced the closure in a Facebook post on July 2, thanking De Jonge Barnes, the staff and the community for their support through the years.
      
 "From the Hop N crew and the community. ... We all love you Linda, you are more than just a boss and business owner," the post read. "It truly has been an honor to have you as a mentor, a mother figure, and a friend.
   
 "To all our amazing crew, we have shed literal blood, sweat and tears over the years. And what started as being coworkers grew into long standing friendships that we now call family. You are appreciated more than you know. Thank you for hanging tough through it all, especially the insanity that has been 2020. Let's keep our heads held high as we walk through that back door one last time.
   
 "To our customers. Thank you all for supporting our Hop N family. Without our loyal customer base these nine years wouldn't have been what it was. Thank you!"
   
 Hop N also noted that it adjusted its hours for the last week of business. The restaurant will be open noon-8 p.m. through Friday. The post also noted a reminder for those with gift cards, particularly recent Fennville graduates, to make sure they use them this week.

With the COVID-19 epidemic in full swing, major upheaval of the global economy is being witnessed. It seems that no industry or sector was untouched by it as organizations hit the pause button on their marketing plans and quickly recalibrated their messaging, operations and daily customer and employee interactions. Efforts to keep everyone safe and healthy became the operational watchword for survival in these times.
 Interestingly, there are firms which have managed to adapt to these new normal faster than the others. With just a few tweaks to their business model, they not only remained unaffected but also managed to grow during this crisis. A digital-first business model has helped firms overcome the disruption of the pandemic and instead allowed them with an opportunity to grow.
 Online education technology platform Byju's is an example of this. With a universal lockdown in India that restricted students' access to schools, colleges, and universities, the ed-tech unicorn opened their platform to students for free. Its users shot up by 150 per cent or 6 million within a short span of a few weeks after doing so. The company is now in a unique position to leverage its content across a larger user base to nurture this captive audience for future success.
 For most organizations resorting to working from home for employees, it has become essential for them to look at securing their remote workforce and make a move towards digital transformation. Citrix, a US-based software company that assists organisations aid work from home for employees, has reimagined its product line comprising software as a service (SaaS), cloud, VPN services and security management. David Benshell, the CEO, in his March blog, pledged to extend business continuity offers to ensure customer safety and success. The company, which supports even frontline sectors such as healthcare, government agencies and food supply chain, has seen a remarkable change in its fortune with the crisis. Since mid-March, the company's stock has seen a remarkable growth of over 35 per cent and is trading at an all-time high.
 Digital-first companies have taken the lead to trigger transformation and growth in their own sectors. Companies such as Google, Facebook and some other IT firms have allowed a $1,000 compensation to employees to set up workspaces at their home. The result will bring about a near seamless transformation in operations for these firms and even better productivity for some.
 Even in non-technology firms, CIOs and CTOs are busy drawing up strategies for future digital transformation. They face the challenge of how to handle the opportunities and risks of digital transformation. In his book,  _The Digital Transformation Playbook_ , David L. Rogers, faculty director of the digital business strategy at Columbia Business School says: "Digital technologies are transforming not only the business aspects related to technology management but virtually all aspects of the company."
 The IT function, which was so far a support function to the core business, is fast becoming the core business model itself. For policymakers, too, the strategy of 'digital first' and speeding up digital transformation is gaining prominence. On June 15, India initiated the global partnership for artificial intelligence (GPAI). "This multi-stakeholder international partnership will promote responsible and human-centric development and use of AI," IT minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said in a tweet.
 Other than securing some much-needed help for developing human-centric AI technology within the country, we should also look at developing strategies for the digital transformation of organisations. It is noteworthy that traditional firms, who commanded premium positions, have now taken the backseat as tech firms or tech-enabled business models gains prominence.
 In India, the small and medium industries sector is the harbinger of over 60 per cent employment and 37.5 per cent GDP of the country. There has been telling impact on MSME industries and jobs generated by them, as a direct result of the lockdown and social distancing norms. Many manufacturers are now considering options of remote production and automation of their human-centric processes to ensure the survivability of their business.
 With the adoption of cloud technology, AI can step in to detect defects in manufacturing or quality shifts without even setting foot on the factory floor. According to global manufacturing automation experts like Anna Katrina- Shedletsky, the manufacturing sector would experience five years of innovation in the next 18 months due to COVID-19. Her statement stems from the fact that with cloud data adoption, more and more manufacturers are having some level of oversight and normalcy, even when engineers cannot travel. In the long term, it is expected that cloud technology will lead to better optimisation of products and processes for manufacturers.
 As digital transformation involves transformations of crucial business operations, affects products and processes, as well as organizational structures and management concepts, organizational leadership will need to start by developing a digital transformation strategy. Companies need to establish management practices to govern these complex transformations. An important approach is to formulate a digital transformation strategy that serves as a central concept to integrate the entire coordination, prioritisation, and implementation of digital transformations within a firm.
 The exploitation and integration of digital technologies often affects large parts of companies and even go beyond their 'processes', by impacting products, sales channels, supply chains and more. Potential benefits of digitization are manifold and include increases in sales or productivity, innovations in value creation, as well as novel forms of interaction with customers, among others. "As a result, entire business models can be reshaped or replaced," _ _ _say Downes and Nunes in their book,  _ _Big Bang Disruption_ _._
 Experts like  _Christian Matt, Thomas Hess and Alexander Benlia_  advocate four essential dimensions to achieve digital transformation. This includes the use of technologies (attitude towards new technology), changes in value creation (need for different forms of monetisation for digital products/services), structural changes (to provide an adequate basis for new operations), and financial aspects (as both driver and binding force behind the transformation).
 Due to its wide scope and the far-reaching consequences, digital transformation strategies should be carefully thought out and aligned with other functional and operational strategies.

Will Power won the first IndyCar Series sanctioned race at Road America in 2016. His start to 2020 has been great on paper, but poor in execution. Power struggled overall at Texas last month, despite running inside the top ten for a majority of the 300-miler, he ultimately finished 13th. In Saturday’s Grand Prix at Indianapolis, Power qualified on pole position and led the most laps, but the caution that gave the lead to Dixon, stuck Power in the back. He finished 20th, being the last car on the lead lap. As a result, he sits 15th in the standings, 73 points back.

In 1859, the passenger steamship "Admella" struck a submerged reef off the South Australia coast, a disaster that claimed the lives of most of those on board. Author Jane Rawson was researching the life of George Hills, an ancestor who survived the sinking, when she began to spin the incident into a fabulist story of a shape-shifting alien who saves Hills from drowning. "From the Wreck" follows Hills from the night before the sinking (he was a ship's steward) to his troubled life as a disaster survivor haunted by his encounter with the otherworldly presence. A first-rate and deeply humane blend of historical fiction, fantasy, sci-fi and horror.

I have no idea what it feels like to be oppressed, and some may think I have no right to speak on this subject. However, speaking as a historian, it is difficult to find examples of where any type of reprisal or revenge has helped anyone. It is easier said than done, but the best way I can think of to help any situation of historic oppression is some type of forgiveness. If the oppressor can honestly repent and recognize its wrongs and the oppressed can offer historical forgiveness, maybe not only can we see peace in areas like Iraq, but here also.

Coming off his and his still relatively young team’s second top-20 finish of the season last Sunday at the iconic Indianapolis Motor Speedway, Daniel Suárez and his No. 96 Toyota Certified Used Vehicles Camry for Gaunt Brothers Racing (GBR) will hit the track this Sunday just down the road at Kentucky Speedway in Sparta, one of Suárez’s best racetracks in all three of NASCAR’s top touring series. The 28-year-old Suárez is the most recent NASCAR Cup Series pole award winner on the 1.5-mile Kentucky oval, having snatched the top qualifying spot in his Stewart-Haas Racing entry a year ago this weekend. He went on to lead 52 laps on race day before bringing home an eighth-place finish. In his four Kentucky outings in the NASCAR Xfinity Series, in which he won Rookie of the Year honors in 2015 and the overall championship in 2016, Suárez has earned three front-row qualifying positions, including the pole in the September 2015 race, and three top-four finishes. He was second to Elliott Sadler in the September 2016 race, third to winner and then-Joe Gibbs Racing teammate Kyle Busch and runner-up Austin Dillon in the July 2016 race, and fourth to winner Brad Keselowski, runner-up and then-Gibbs teammate Erik Jones and third-place Busch in the July 2015 race. And in his two career Kentucky appearances in the NASCAR Gander RV & Outdoors Truck Series, both with Kyle Busch Motorsports, Suárez started and finished fourth after leading 18 laps in 2015, and started on the pole and finished 11th after leading 59 laps in 2016. This weekend, in his fourth career Cup Series outing at Kentucky, Suárez returns to the Bluegrass State with his single-car GBR team that is competing in the Cup Series full-time for the first time since joining the series in 2018. It will be just the 54th Cup Series outing for GBR – a mere season-and-a-half worth of races competing against multicar organizations, many of which have been around for decades. Suárez and his GBR team feel confident they will one day be racing for wins against those larger, more established organizations, and they know full well that it will take time. Grinding out finishes like last Sunday’s 20th place at Indy, in which the team fixed a power steering fluid leak and related alternator issues during the first half of the race, are the signs of the incremental progress the team is determined to continue from week to week. At this Sunday’s 400-mile race, Suárez and his GBR team look to take another successful step forward in their evolution together, and perhaps benefit in big ways from his previous successes on the state of Kentucky’s second-most- famous racetrack.

"articleBody": "SOCORRO, Texas (KVIA/CNN) - A Texas police officer is being praised for rushing to the rescue and saving an 8-year-old boy from a mobile home fire.Officer Joshua Gonzales with Socorro Police says his mind was running a thousand miles an hour as he arrived on scene at a mobile home fire Monday night. No one was in the home engulfed in flames, but the one next door, close enough to get scorched, was occupied.When Gonzales heard there were people inside, he immediately rushed in to help. He says he found two adults, one of whom was 75, and an 8-year-old boy.“It was well within my heart and soul to run in and try to get these people out,” Gonzales said.Gonzales says he grabbed the boy and ran out while an off-duty firefighter escorted the adults out.Witness Cristobal Marin recorded video of the scene and the rescue.“All of a sudden, I see this small cloud of gray smoke just come up, caught my attention. Then, all of a sudden, right after it, followed this big cloud of black smoke,” Marin said. “What caught my attention instantly... is there’s a police officer that came out right behind the flames.”Gonzales says the 8-year-old was sad about his football cleats being lost in the fire, so he told him he would buy him new ones.“We have to see that there’s still good in humanity, good in people,” Marin said.The boy did not require medical attention. The 75-year-old was treated at the scene for smoke inhalation.About 30 firefighters worked to put out the flames. Officials say the mobile home was a complete loss. They also indicated the cause of the fire was not immediately known and would be under investigation.The Red Cross was helping the displaced residents.

Indian online learning platform Unacademy announced that it has acquired Chandigarh-based startup PrepLadder for $50 million in a cash-and-stock deal.
 Founded in 2016, PrepLadder specializes in courses aimed at medical aspirants in the country. Unacademy through this acquisition seeks to bolster its presence in medical entrance examination categories such as NEET PG and Foreign Medical Graduates Examination (FMGE).
 Facebook-backed Unacademy in the past three months has recorded a 100 per cent increase in its paid subscriber base. The company witnessed a 100 per cent steep growth in the daily average watch time across platforms.
 Commenting on the acquisition, Gaurav Munjal, chief executive officer and co- founder, Unacademy, said, "As we strengthen our position as a market leader in the test prep market, bringing PrepLadder on board will play a strategic role for Unacademy in the medical entrance examinations category."
 In 2018, Unacademy acquired WiFiStudy, an online learning platform on YouTube for an undisclosed amount and said that both were cash-and-stock deals.
 Earlier this year, the Bengaluru-based firm bagged $110 million from Facebook and General Atlantic and others, and later went on to acquire Kreatryx and CodeChef as part of its inorganic growth strategy.
 Unacademy, which started as a YouTube channel in 2010, now has more than 10,000 registered educators and over 30 million learners.
 The development came at a time when Unacademy competitor Byju's is in talks to acquire Doubtnut, another ed-tech startup, to strengthen its dominance, according to a Tech Crunch report. Byju's has recently raised an undisclosed amount from Mary Meeker's equity fund bond.
