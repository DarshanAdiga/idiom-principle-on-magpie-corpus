When Bud Adams died in 2013, his estate was placed into a trust and divided between his two daughters, Amy and Susie, with each receiving a one-third share of the franchise and a third of KSA Industries. The other third was divided in three 11% shares to the widow and sons of Bud Adams’ late son, Kenneth Adams III.
 Initially, after Bud Adams’ death, the family installed Susie Adams Smith as controlling owner and made her husband Tommy Smith team president. The NFL fined the Titans for the ownership structure not conforming to the league’s majority ownership rules in 2016, when the sisters each controlled 33% and the remaining third was split among their late brother’s family.
 The family installed Adams Strunk as controlling owner in 2015, brought back Steve Underwood from retirement to take over as team president and the Smiths were moved aside except for Susie Smith retaining one-third ownership in the franchise.
 Adams Strunk fired Ken Whisenhunt in November 2015 and fired Mike Mularkey in January 2018 after the Titans’ first playoff berth since 2008 when Tennessee reached the divisional round. She hired current general manager Jon Robinson and hired coach Mike Vrabel a week after firing Mularkey.
 Vrabel coached the Titans last season to their first AFC championship in 17 years. The Titans currently are 8-4 and sit atop the AFC South with the tiebreaker over Indianapolis, trying to win their first division title since 2008. They are a win shy of their fifth straight winning season.
 The Titans, under Adams Strunk’s leadership, also helped Nashville bid’s to host the 2019 NFL draft, which smashed the league’s previous attendance record by drawing more than 600,000 to Music City.

Making a statement that doesn’t attempt to excuse such transgressions, but instead acknowledges how abusive and manipulative the actions were, is certainly a step in the right direction. Still, explaining your behavior is not the same thing as changing it, especially LaBeouf has both his greater star power and traditional power dynamics in his favor (he is a white man, and Barnett is a woman of color). It may be a little bit too easy for his fans to let LaBeouf off the hook, given his frankly lackluster response.

The young scouser was joint-top of the Reds’ rankings for shots, chances created and successful dribbles, except that in each case it was with a different player – Mohamed Salah, Roberto Firmino and Sadio Mane for those three statistics respectively.
 Jones was directly involved in five shots, as he had three of his own and set up opportunities for Mane and Salah. That was more goal attempts than any other Liverpool player contributed to, and that doesn’t include his part in the equaliser.
 Having exchanged passes with Firmino, Jones was brought down by Ivan Cavaleiro (and 'fouls suffered' was another list which he led). Gini Wijnaldum’s subsequent free-kick struck Aboubakar Kamara on the arm, enabling Salah to equalise from the spot.
 Liverpool’s number 17 then took the only shot either side had between the penalty and full time too. But that undersells what Jones did to reach that point, as he received the ball midway in the Reds’ half and drove towards goal in a manner akin to Steve McManaman’s famous goal against Celtic.
 There were also shades of Steven Gerrard’s first Liverpool goal too, with the only shame being that Jones couldn’t find the finish to match the quality of his run.

In 1996, she took a leap of faith to venture out to her ‘dream job' at Spotted Bear Ranger Station in the Bob Marshall Wilderness. Later she worked at Big Prairie and Schafer Meadows, joining daughter Angie who was working for the Forest Service. She was delighted when son Marty hiked in for a visit.

"If you’re in one place there’s one set of protocols for the entire state. that’s one positive to it," said Auriemma, whose team has been to every Final Four since 2008. "Trying to get 64 teams from all over the country to fly to all those places and deal with all the protocols involved everywhere, it made more sense I’m sure to bring in everyone to Texas.”
 San Antonio was already the site of the 2021 Final Four. The NCAA has now begun talks with the city on hosting the whole thing and the organization hopes to have plans finalized by the end of January at the latest. It is likely that the NCAA could play games as far away as Austin because of the need for hotels as well as practice and game venues for 64 teams.
 The first two rounds of the women’s tournament have been played on campus sites the past few seasons with the top four seeds in each region hosting. The regionals were slated to be played this season in Albany, New York, Austin, Texas, Cincinnati and Spokane, Washington.
 "By making this difficult decision now, it allows for an earlier opportunity to work proactively with local public health officials within the host communities and ensures that the identified guidelines and protocols are considered for a more controlled environment,” said Nina King, the NCAA women’s basketball committee chair and senior athletic director at Duke.
 The NCAA expects the tournament to be played in late March and early April as usual, though there is a chance it could be shorter. The tourneys are typically just short of three weeks long.
 "I think for the health and safety of the players you’re going to have to take a look at all these things,” Auriemma said of shrinking the timeframe of the tournament. "How many games do you want to play in one week when you're talking about the biggest games you’re playing in one year?”
 NCAA senior vice president Lynn Holzman said there are a host of logistics the women’s basketball committee needs to work out. Many teams have already had to pause their seasons because of positive COVID-19 tests. Holzman wouldn’t speculate what the protocols would be if a tournament team has a positive case.
 "This is one of the topics both the men’s and women’s committees and any other championship committee will have to have,” she said. "We don’t have an answer for that today.”
 This won’t be the first time a women’s tournament will be played at one site. From 1972-1977, the Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women played a 16-team postseason tournament at one site. The NCAA Tournament was first played in 1982.
 Two schools, Incarnate Word and UTSA, will serve as hosts for the Final Four.
 "We were already preparing to host a tremendous women’s Final Four; the opportunity to develop a plan for hosting all 64 teams is both exciting and a great opportunity for our local economy,” San Antonio Mayor Ron Nirenberg said. "It is also a tremendous responsibility, and I know our local organizing committee and our hospitality industry will make the safety and well-being of the athletes, coaches and fans its highest priority.”

Here, historian Malcolm Bidder looks at the first 50 years of horse racing in Torquay.
 It was on February 16, 1854, that the first race meeting was held in Cary Park with a grandstand built behind Furrough Cross.
 The Sun London newspaper reported that it would receive the race results by electric telegraph.
 The races then moved to Petitor where, to accommodate spectators who had paid for a paddock ticket, a substantial wooden grandstand was built with a refreshment room underneath which catered for 1,200 people.
 This was put out to tender every year and demolished after the meeting and the wood auctioned off in lots.
 Special trains were laid on for race goers from Exeter and Plymouth with celebrations going on late into the night.
 South Devon Railway announced that passengers with special train tickets could use the return ticket the following day.
 In 1870, the West of England Handicap Chase was declared void when the owners refused to run the horses because of an unfair handicap.
 The following year when the prize money was increased to 100 Guineas, it was won by Mr Graham’s horse Dodono.
 Sir Lawrence Palk informed the race committee that 1876 would be the last year for horse racing at Petitor.
 He was not happy about anti-social behaviour the racing attracted.
 A report in the East and South Devon Advertiser on February 24, 1877, suggested that a meeting of Newton Abbot and the former Torquay races committee with a view to sharing a racecourse at Kingskerswell was a possibility.
 However, Torquay races moved to Waddeton in 1878 and Newton a Abbot races opened in 1879.
 In 1882, Newton Abbot races proposed to run a race meeting on Easter Monday, clashing with a meeting at Waddeton.
 The Torquay committee warned Newton Abbot of the consequences if they went ahead.
 Torquay races had powerful stewards including R Mallock, W Chatto and Lord Churston.
 The meeting at Waddeton was very popular particularly with Great Western Railway which ran excursions to Churston.
 A meeting held on January 13, 1883, at the Union Hotel in Torquay noted that Torquay races had only moved to Waddeton on a temporary basis.
 A reliable informant said Lord Halton would be prepared to take over Petitor.
 In March 1886, Lord Halton laid the foundation stone for a new permanent stand for 3,000 spectators.
 By the following year, the attendance was more than 15,000.
 In 1901, eight licences were applied for to run booths to sell alcohol although the vicar of Ellacombe voiced his objections.
 Mr Irving Taylor of Teignmouth applied for a booth to sell alcohol in the paddock.
 This was unusual as the ardent drinker would get drunk with the price paid for entry to the paddock enclosure.
 The licences were granted for booths to open from midday to 6pm.
 In April 1904, Superintendant Ryall, a mounted policeman, rode his horse across the course to warn people who were inside the ropes.
 Celebration, one of the runners, collided with the police horse.
 Frank Underwood Webb, stable keeper of Landsdowne Mews, then proceeded to sue Torquay races for £50 damages to the horse.
 At Torquay County Court on October 15, Superintendant Ryall insisted that although his horse was on the track, it was close to the ropes.
 After hearing from several witnesses, the jury returned a verdict that negligence had taken place and awarded the plaintiff £50 damages.
 However, the judge disagreed and overturned the verdict, awarding the defendants their costs.

All beaches along the Garden Route and Eastern Cape will be closed from Wednesday until 3 January while Durban beaches will only be closed on traditionally busy days like Christmas and new year’s.
 Public health expert professor Alex van den Heever said Ramaphosa's restrictions on beaches might have been too harsh while the regulations around alcohol and the curfew were spot on.
 “Overall, it was a proportionate response. I think the closure of beaches may create a problem but it is an understandable response at this point.”
 Meanwhile, the Restaurants Association of South Africa (RASA) will be writing to Ramaphosa on Tuesday morning to ask for a review of the new COVID-19 lockdown curfew to allow staff to go home later.
 Although the restaurant industry acknowledges that it’s a fine balancing act, the association's CEO Wendy Alberts said they needed more time to help the industry to survive.
 “This curfew complicates trade for us and certainly minimises the ability to have extended turnovers and deep cleaning. It takes an hour for us to deep clean and sanitise to prepare for the next day. We need to get staff home by 11 pm now.”
 Ramaphosa said the longer curfew would help with super-spreader events.

NASHVILLE — Sarah Fuller became the first woman to score in a Power Five conference football game, cleanly kicking a pair of extra points for Vanderbilt in a 42-17 loss to Tennessee on Saturday.
 The goalkeeper for Vanderbilt's Southeastern Conference women's soccer champs made both of her kicks, to the cheers of her teammates and family.
 "This whole time has been if I can do it, if I'm good enough to do it," Fuller said after the game. "It wasn't if I was a girl or not. So that's something I've really appreciated. At the end of the day, they treated me like an athlete and that's the best I could ask for."

THE tourism industry in Victoria Falls is planning to erect a plaque in honour of President Mnangagwa at the Zambezi bridge's "No man's land" between Zimbabwe and Zambia border for tourist attraction purposes.      The decision follows the erection of a similar plaque by the Victoria Falls Municipality last week when it granted President Mnangagwa the Freedom of the City.      The local authority erected its plaque at the council offices last Wednesday in honour of President Mnangagwa's contribution to the country's liberation and development of the resort town to a city.      The plaque symbolises the Freedom of the City granted to the President by the council.      It is located at the council offices' main gate and reads: "In remembrance of the sacrifices and sufferings endured by many cadres of our liberation struggle, Victoria Falls City Council celebrates the Freedom of the City to one luminary, ED Mnangagwa, who was incarcerated by the white supremist regime of the Rhodesian government and notably, freed into Zambia in 1972 at the Victoria Falls Bridge. Significantly, he is the first freeman of the city of Victoria Falls."      President Mnangagwa was handed a casket made of teak wood from Lupane with the city's court of arms and a key, which symbolises the freedom. Freedom of the City is a highest civic honour a council can bestow on some prominent man or woman for meritorious service either of a national or local character.

Fuller made history as the first female to play in a Power Five conference game on Nov. 28 with a squib kickoff to open the second half at Missouri. She has remained on the roster even as Vanderbilt's other kickers came out of quarantine and rejoined the team.
 Tennessee coach Jeremy Pruitt, who had a daughter earlier this year, said it was awesome.
 "She's obviously a winner," Pruitt said about Fuller. "And she walked up there and kicked it right through. So I just think it says a whole lot about her and really, kind of her fortitude to be brave enough to go do this."
 The Commodores fell to 0-9 this season.
 No woman before Fuller had appeared in an SEC game or for any Power Five team. Liz Heaston became the first woman to score in college football with two extra points for Willamette of NAIA on Oct. 18, 1997.
 Katie Hnida was the first woman to score at the Football Bowl Subdivision level with two extra points for New Mexico on Aug. 30, 2003.

“Dr McCartney was big in stature, but he was a gentle giant,” he said. “He made that week fun. I can remember almost 40 years later some lessons I learned from him. First of all, on the first night he shared with me, he said ‘Richard, you have to pack your own shoe’, it means as a psychologist you have to choose your destiny and you have to go after it. The second lesson was the importance of thinking out of the box and being creative. And finally, he talked about the importance of taking mental health outside of Sandilands. He said it’s just not about Sandilands, it’s just not about working within four walls.”

The human traffickers told Julekha Begum it would take less than a week to smuggle her to Malaysia to meet the husband she barely knows.
 Instead she spent two months marooned at sea in the hold of a fishing boat with 500 others. In that time, she said traffickers beat her sister to death and threw countless bodies into the sea.
 Eventually she was forced to return to a sprawling refugee camp in Bangladesh alongside a million other members of the stateless Rohingya group.
 The video-call app they used to get married in 2017 remains the only means of contact for Julekha and her husband, Abdu Hamid, who lives on Malaysia's Langkawi island, a common landing point for Rohingya boats.
 "I am waiting for the day I will meet my husband," Begum told AFP as she broke down in tears.
 "We've been married three years but we haven't once touched."
 Begum, her mother and sister were among hundreds of thousands of Rohingya who fled mostly Buddhist Myanmar to neighbouring Bangladesh in 2017 to escape a brutal military crackdown.
 She was married to Hamid shortly after via imo, a video-call app popular in Bangladesh.
 Begum and Hamid knew each other as children and, as is the custom in Rohingya society, their match was arranged by their parents.
 After two years of staying in touch via video-calls, Hamid managed to arrange for Begum and her sister to take a boat.
 Thousands of Rohingya try to make the perilous journey each year, putting themselves at the mercy of ruthless people smugglers and corrupt authorities in multiple countries.
 The voyage that Begum embarked upon in February was a disaster.
 As well as her sister, dozens of people died as food ran low and the boat was unable to land, according to Begum and other passengers AFP spoke with as part of a months-long investigation into the human trafficking network.
 "We starved, many died and the bodies were thrown into the sea," Begum said, as she recounted the horror of her sister's death.
 "The smuggler mercilessly beat her with a leather belt. I couldn't do anything but cry and curse."
 \- Tourist island nightmare -
 Rohingya have flocked to Malaysia for many years, mostly by boat but also overland, fleeing Myanmar where they have been forced from their homes and seen their villages razed.
 The UN says the Myanmar military's crackdown on Rohingya has amounted to genocide.
 Hamid escaped Myanmar about seven years ago, travelling first by boat to Thailand and then crossing on foot into Malaysia.
 He initially worked on a construction site before landing a job in a hotel on Langkawi, a popular holiday resort island.
 But, while tourists enjoy themselves, Hamid thinks about his wife.
 "Sometimes when I am in a deep sleep, I imagine my wife is asleep next to me, I can feel her warmth," Hamid told AFP.
 AFP used a pseudonym to protect his identity, as Rohingya in Malaysia have faced mounting hostility amid the pandemic.
 Video calls offer some comfort for Hamid and Begum, but their conversations rarely escape the shadows of their misery.
 "Often we express our love over the phone. Sometimes we laugh about things but often we cry because we cannot live like a normal husband and wife," Hamid said.
 While they cannot be together, the marriage at least provides some financial help for Begum's family as Hamid usually sends them between 200 and 400 Malaysian ringgit ($50 to $100) a month.
 And the couple are not ready to give up on their relationship.
 "My dream is still to bring my wife to Malaysia," Hamid said.
 In Bangladesh, Begum echoed her husband: "I must reach him someday".
 However Begum's only options to reach Malaysia now appear to be a lengthy journey overland or getting a counterfeit Bangladeshi passport to fly -- which is prohibitively expensive.
 After this year's horrors, Begum said she will not return to the sea.
 "I am too traumatised to get on another boat."
