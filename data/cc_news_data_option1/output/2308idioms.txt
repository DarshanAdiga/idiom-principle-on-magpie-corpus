Nicki's Barbz gang has understandably been defending their Queen, but the "Chun-Li" rapper is a big girl so she asked them to retreat. Taking to Twitter to address the concerns, Nicki said, "You don't have to defend me. I'm not afraid of internet trolls, blogs, artists. I don't jump on band wagons." Perhaps Nicki believes she was ahead of the curve because she collaborated with the rapper in the past against the wishes of many fans and critics. "Many will never know what it feels like to have a mind of their own," she added.

DENVER (AP) — Colorado lawmakers wound down a shortened 2020 session Saturday having drastically cut education funding because of the coronavirus pandemic’s revenue impact, allocating $70 million in federal aid to struggling business and residents, and passing a sweeping police transparency bill. Colorado’s November initiatives ballot got a little more crowded, too. Lawmakers referred a measure to ease property tax burdens on business. Another initiative in the works would raise cigarette taxes and tax nicotine products such as e-cigarettes and vaping products. Bills to increase child vaccination rates and reduce business tax breaks and exemptions to fund schools were making their way through the Democrat-led General Assembly’s two chambers. After a 10-week hiatus forced by the coronavirus, lawmakers approved a budget for the fiscal year that begins July 1 that cut $3.3 billion from the $13 billion general fund. The budget cuts K-12 funding by $621 million and $598 million from higher education. It eliminates a $225 million payment into the state employee retirement fund. At Republicans’ insistence, $162 million in property tax credits for seniors were preserved. Lawmakers were still bargaining over a controversial bill introduced by Democrats days ago to suspend or reduce business tax credits to help make up the hit being taken by the budget and by public schools. Republicans and business leaders from across the state say they weren’t consulted on the bill and that it will hurt businesses trying to survive in a pandemic that’s forced more than half a million workers across the state to seek unemployment benefits. Democratic Gov. Jared Polis suggested Thursday he’d veto the bill without drastic changes. Lawmakers passed or advanced bills to help...

The Delaware Interscholastic Athletic Association Board of Directors met for nearly three-and-a-half hours on Thursday, but ultimately their meeting was about 24 hours too early.
 They discussed changes to the high school physical form during the pandemic, when summer conditioning programs could possibly, and even whether a drastic change to the sports calendar for 2020-21 school year is needed, but it all seemed to end with the same conclusion: Governor John Carney's briefing on Friday holds the key.
 The Department of Public Health, through the Division of Small Business, released guidelines for baseball and softball's return to play earlier this week, and are expected to announce even more during Friday's bi-weekly briefing.
 While athletes and coaches are chomping at the bit to get back into practices and competition, Dr. Bradley Bley from the Sports Medicine Advisory Committee (SMAC) said one major barrier is preventing any movement to this point.
 "If we're not back in school, and there's no on-site learning, we recommend that the DIAA sports not proceed."
 Carney's executive order in regards to schools has not changed, and no specific guidance as of Thursday night had been given as to whether that will change when Phase 2 of the reopening plan is instituted on Monday, June 15.
 If Carney, through discussion with the Department of Public Health, does decide to allow conditioning drills to resume, the DIAA's board decided to not take an action, setting June 15 as the date that summer workouts can begin at schools, depending on their level of comfort with COVID-19 safety protocols.
 Summer workouts or not, attention is being paid towards August 17, the current first day of practice for fall sports, including football.
 Bley said SMAC looked at guidelines presented by the National Federation of High Schools, and said it could come down to sport-by-sport decisions.
