When it comes to Sinema, the freshman senator who broke with Democrats to confirm Attorney General William Barr, her silence on impeachment suggests her vote remains up in the air. A spokesperson for the lawmaker recently said she supports gathering additional evidence to “make a more fully informed decision at the end of the trial.”

Julian, who has his Masters in Clinical Counseling, said he is a very introspective and analytical person. He said he found there were times when he was dancing that he was just there, present in the moment and not analyzing it and there was something very freeing and refreshing in that experience.                                                  "I love teaching in general, but I do really enjoy teaching couples ballroom dancing," Julian said. "First off, there's something very special about bringing someone to a place outside their comfort zone and seeing how they grow and stretch through the process."                                                  Julian said he has seen a number of people grow in confidence as they learn to dance.                                                   "But secondly, I find great meaning in offering couples an activity that they can enjoy and participate in together," Julian said. "I've seen many couples who find themselves drifting apart in their relationship simply because they have so few interests and activities in common. I find that ballroom dancing can offer them an opportunity to find more enjoyment in their relationship just by engaging in a common activity together, learning about each other and enjoying one another in the process."                                                  "My deepest desire is that couples learn to see, appreciate and enjoy one another in new ways, to imbibe deeply in one another's love through dance," Faith said. "I hope they gain a new hobby they can enjoy together, either while out, or in the privacy of their own homes."                                                  Faith said she hopes what the students gain in learning dance can build in them the boldness to go against the grain and keep their own rhythm in a sea of people who are different than them.                                                  Julian said ballroom dancing has taught him about communication, intimacy, leading and following, and essentially, what it means to live in an intimate relationship with another. He said it has informed his spiritual life, his personal relationships and his counseling practice.                                                  "Ballroom dancing is unique among all forms of dancing in that the crux of the dance is the intimate connection between two people," Julian said. "No other form of dance that I know of is so fully dependent on and an expression of an ongoing and instantaneous communication between two people."                                                  Julian and Faith plan to teach an 8-week course entitled "Relationship in Movement" in the future which will use ballroom dancing as the medium to teach relationship and communication skills. They can be found on Facebook at Relationship in Movement.                                                  If you are interested in the Ballroom Dance Classes on Monday nights starting Feb. 3, private lessons, personalized group classes, small group events, teaching workshops or the future "Relationship in Movement" course, contact Julian or Faith Affrime at 856-701-3273 or 856-669-1709

"Every once in a while there is a variant of flu that emerges that poses an existential threat to us as a species," Dr. Dennis Carroll, Director of the U.S. Agency for International Development's Emerging Threats Unit, says in the first episode of _Pandemic._ And as the docuseries covers in-depth, the 1918 (H1N1) flu absolutely fits the bill for a globally threatening disease.


--DocBreak--
Simply put, there's no way to know how this particular disease will play out, whether you're looking to the 1918 Flu in the past, or the Event 201 simulation in the present. It's not all doom and gloom, though.  _Pandemic_ may paint a grim picture of a viral outbreak, but it will also inform you on what can be done to combat the flu. And that, at least, is something.

Fox wasn’t aware that somehow his name was thrown into the mix as someone possibly on board the helicopter. Along with Kobe’s name and tributes to the Oscar winner starting to pour in, some were also coming in for him on Twitter, too. His best friend, college basketball coach King Rice, was one of many told that Fox may have been on the helicopter. Rice frantically began calling Fox, who was initially ignoring the messages to focus on his kids. However, once the former Lakers star realized his friend was calling nonstop, he answered.

Mayor Lenny Curry was correct in replacing the entire JEA board effective Feb. 28, which a front-page Times-Union editorial proposed.                                                                                                                                                                       While all of the board members were not intimately involved in the misdeeds of former CEO Aaron Zahn last July -- Dane Grey was not even on the board -- a fresh start is needed as JEA seeks to rebuild trust.                                                                                                                                                                       Board Chair April Green, who separately announced her retirement at the end of the meeting Tuesday, was quoted by the Jacksonville Business Journal as saying that the board needs members with financial, governance and utility experience, implying that the current board did not have that.                                                                                                                                                                       As a Times-Union editorial also suggested, JEA's charter should be changed to require that certain kinds of expertise be included among board members along the lines of the Environmental Protection Board.                                                                                                                                                                       JEA is a multibillion dollar organization. It requires board members with the kind of expertise found on Fortune 500 companies.                                                                                                                                                                       In addition, selection and confirmation of board members should address a common problem among governmental boards. Members, active in their own businesses, often become passive before powerful CEOs.                                                                                                                                                                       In fact, the City Council Rules Committee during its confirmation hearings ought to ask every nominee to agree to something like this.                                                                                                                                                                       "I promise to speak up when I don't understand something.                                                                                                                                                                       "If necessary, I am willing to be the only board member to speak up.                                                                                                                                                                       "I see my role as a service to my community.                                                                                                                                                                       "My job is not to be a friend of the CEO but to represent the ratepayers of JEA.                                                                                                                                                                       "Therefore, I am willing to be unpopular if that is what it takes."                                                                                                                                                                       Open positions                                                                                                                                                                       Zahn hired a number of high-level executives. If some of those positions are vacant, they should not be filled until a new CEO is on board. That is a good suggestion from Councilman Ron Salem.                                                                                                                                                                       In fact,  it is likely that a new CEO would want to eliminate some of the positions. Of course, some of them need to be filled with acting executives.                                                                                                                                                                       City Council liaison                                                                                                                                                                       JEA makes the City Council liaison to the board sit in the audience. At Tuesday's meeting, Councilman Danny Becton moved to the board table when speaking, then returned to the audience.                                                                                                                                                                       There has been discussion in City Council committees that all council liaisons should be at the head table and be encouraged to speak, even though they are not voting members.                                                                                                                                                                       That is the practice of the Downtown Investment Authority and the Jacksonville Port Authority.                                                                                                                                                                       Firing Zahn for cause                                                                                                                                                                       There were plenty of reasons to fire former CEO Zahn with cause as outlined in a report from the city's office of General Counsel. Zahn's lawyer contested that.                                                                                                                                                                       Zahn's misdeeds included willful misconduct, gross negligence and gross neglect of duties, among others, said Deputy General Counsel Sean Granat.                                                                                                                                                                       The report from the Office of General Counsel stated that Zahn did not save text messages related to JEA's business, failed to cooperate truthfully and completely with the investigation, failed to disclose "personal and business conflicts of interest and exposed JEA to potential lawsuits by neighboring counties where JEA provides utility service.                                                                                                                                                                       The next step may be arbitration or litigation. If that happens, the city's legal staff should handle all of the city's defense work. The large staff of the Office of General Counsel -- about 40 attorneys -- ought to have the expertise.                                                                                                                                                                       Much is still not known                                                                                                                                                                       City Council is proceeding with a special investigative task force on the JEA issues. Two immediate questions come to mind:                                                                                                                                                                       • Which non-JEA employees were set to participate in the performance pay plan that would have produced a windfall profit?                                                                                                                                                                       • Was former Board Chair Alan Howard the attorney not named in the general counsel's report? Howard's law firm received a consulting contract from JEA in the sales negotiation process. The report said that discussions about that contract started when a former board member still was on the board and had not yet cast a vote in favor of inviting offers for a potential sale of JEA. The report said Zahn failed to tell the rest of the board about the "discussion and conflict of interest."

"We'll all be onstage, all the time," says Harris. "I know that. Because there's no entrance and exits." Talk about an endurance act -- even the Knicks get to take a timeout every once in a while.

There has been one potential close call in a past Super Bowl: Five years ago, federal authorities said they encountered a plot in Phoenix by a man who wanted to attack the Super Bowl and an adjacent mall and entertainment district in Glendale, Arizona, with pipe bombs. They said the man, Abdul Malik Abdul Kareem, was unable to obtain the explosives, and the game between the New England Patriots and the Seattle Seahawks was not hit.

At the same time, set better boundaries. If your long hours at work stem from a demanding boss or lazy colleagues, put your foot down. Insist that you need to leave at a certain time at least _some_ nights during the week, and if you have teammates who aren't pulling their weight, don't let them get away with it. Nobody wants to be a tattletale, but if you're routinely staying at the office an hour later than you want to in order to compensate for other people's shortcomings, that's something your manager must be made aware of.

The other reason why I believe studying undergraduate in one’s country is beneficial is because it gives one the time needed to mature.Most 20 year olds do not really know what they want in life..Coming to America at that very young age is not good because one can be very vulnerable to bad influence.I am not saying everyone who comes to America at a very young age doesn’t do well, but there are high chances of losing your focus…It’s good you finish your undergrad in your country, maybe hustle for about a year as you prepare to relocate, and then make a move for your master’s.

Now, please pursue the issue of traffic lights. His last comment, "Jacksonville seems to be a century behind with its traffic light system" is right on.                                                                                                                                                                       As I drive throughout the county, I can't help to wonder who is responsible for this mish-mash of signals that turn to red when traffic is approaching and remain green when no traffic has already left the intersection.                                                                                                                                                                       The timer system seems to be erratic. When was a thorough traffic survey at intersections conducted?                                                                                                                                                                       Another issue to be looked into is the repair of potholes. There seems to be no concern or professionalism exhibited by the crews who do this. Some of the "repaired" roads are like washboards, the repairs totally uneven with the surface of the roads.

Certainly the food stamp program has helped many people get through the rough times, however it has also created dependence and has enabled the proliferation of irresponsible behavior.                                                                                                                                                                       The economy is thriving and unemployment is at a 50-year low, so isn't it time to get people off the food stamp rolls and government dependence?                                                                                                                                                                       As far as evangelicals are concerned, yes, they tend to support President Donald Trump, not because he is some shining example of morality and politeness, but because he supports policies that actually work and are favorable to help the poor to rise out of poverty.                                                                                                                                                                       It is true that evangelicals are called to help the poor, the sick, and the down and out; however, they also know that financial help is not always the best policy.                                                                                                                                                                       Sometimes the poor simply need food. However for many they need the transforming power of Christ to help them overcome any number of problems.                                                                                                                                                                       For the poor who are caught in a cycle of poverty, Christ brings hope to overcome government dependency and a victimhood mentality. To others He brings a standard of behavior that can help them overcome many of their personal problems that are catalysts for poverty.                                                                                                                                                                       For others Christ and his followers can bring opportunity, education and job skills that go far in relieving poverty and bringing self-respect. But most important Christ brings his saving grace and love that leads to eternal life, to a lost world.                                                                                                                                                                       I sincerely hope that our reader can experience the transforming power of Christ in his life.

The top-four conundrum in the 2019-’20 Indian Super League took an interesting turn as FC Goa edged past Odisha FC 4-2 at the Kalinga Stadium in Bhubaneshwar on Wednesday.                                                  A Vinit Rai own-goal (21st minute) followed by a Jackichand Singh brace (24’, 27’) set Goa on their way to a big win. Manuel Onwu (59’, 65’) then scored twice in the second half and nearly brought Odisha back into the game. A late goal from Ferran Corominas (90+1’) settled the result.                                                  With 30 points from 15 matches, Goa moved three points clear at the top of the table. Odisha’s playoff hopes took a hit and they remain fourth with 21 points. With games in hand, the likes of Mumbai City FC and Chennaiyin FC now have a chance to overtake Odisha.                                                  Goa were off to a dominant start, registering more than sixty per cent possession in the first quarter.  Goa’s pressure and dominance yielded three goals in six minutes in the first half. In the 21st minute, Edu Bedia’s free-kick took a deflection off Vinit and beat goalkeeper Francisco Dorronsorro on its way into the net.                                                  Odisha’s right flank struggled to contain the attacks and the visitors soon took advantage. Mandar Rao Dessai ran down the wings and squared the ball for Jackichand whose strike found the corner of the net in the 24th minute.                                                  Three minutes later, Hugo Boumous was gifted space and time on the ball to swing a cross into the box for Jackichand who slotted home his second with aplomb.                                                  Odisha had the ball in the net before the break, thanks to new signing Manuel Onwu who finished well after collecting a clever pass into the box from Vinit, but the striker was ruled offside.                                                  Odisha pressed higher up the field in a bid to get back into the game after the restart.                                                  Close to the hour mark, Onwu opened his ISL account with a well-taken header. Narayan Das whipped a cross into the centre of the box from the left flank and Onwu, who was left unmarked, placed his header into the bottom right corner, out of goalkeeper Mohammad Nawaz’s reach.                                                  Goa looked to hit back immediately as Corominas dribbled at the Odisha defence through the centre. He released Brandon Fernandes into the box, but the strike was kept out well by Dorronsoro.                                                  The hosts fought their way back into the contest and reduced the deficit again in the 65th minute. Onwu beat Mourtada Fall in the air from a corner at the near post and his header, which took a deflection off the Goa centre-back, went in.                                                  Odisha continued to threaten as the game inched closer to the full-time whistle, but it were Goa who clinched a late goal to seal the result.                                                  Substitute Manvir Singh broke forward down the right flank on a counter before squaring the ball into the box. It fell nicely for Corominas who simply turned it in from close range.

The copter will fly almost 50 miles (80.5 km) in one go, after which it will land at one of several ReadyH2 refuelling stations located along the route. There, a human operator will manually refill its tank – the refuelling process may be automated in the future.                                                                  The drone will then continue on down the pipeline, covering another 50 miles until it reaches the next station.                                                                  Plans call for the pilot project to continue for six months, during which time the drone will both perform routine inspections in a variety of weather conditions, and respond to staged emergency situations such as leaks. It will be remotely-controlled for the time being, although that might change as the system is developed further.                                                                  "As we go through this process, we’re going to be looking for ways to automate certain things, being careful not to run afoul of FAA regulations," says Matt Sloane, CEO of Skyfire Consulting. "We also have to ensure that we’re meeting the guidelines established by oil and gas regulators as well, so these are the types of things we’re going to be working through in that testing period."

El Proyecto Cunina pretende sentar las bases para la prevención de la leucemia linfoblástica y que los niños que la padecen se puedan curar. Investigación promovida por la Fundación Unoentrecienmil y que se va a iniciar con la participación de cien familias. Es un proyecto de investigación pionero al que la Fundación Unoentrecienmil ha destinado 540.000 euros y en el que van a participar el Hospital Infantil Niño Jesús, el Centro de Investigación del Cáncer de Salamanca y el Hospital Universitario de Düsseldorf. El 5% de los niños que nacen tienen predisposición a padecer leucemia, pero sólo la desarrollan aquellos que experimentan ciertas alteraciones inmunológicas. El objetivo es determinar cuáles son esas alteraciones para elaborar una vacuna que las prevenga. Tal y como asegura el doctor Manuel Ramírez, responsable de la Unidad de Terapias Avanzadas del Niño Jesús y coordinador del proyecto, la "mayoría de los niños que tienen esa mutación no van a desarrollar leucemia", por lo que el siguiente paso de la investigación es entender qué tiene que suceder para que el niño que está predispuesto a tenerla, la desarrolle. "Hay alteraciones inmunológicas que se tienen que sumar a la predisposición. Si no se suman, por más predisposición que haya, no hay leucemia. Por eso, lo que se trata con este proyecto y otros similares es entender qué es esa alteración inmunológicas para revertirla", comenta. La leucemia linfoblástica aguda es el tipo de cáncer más frecuente en niños. Esta patología va en aumento y, según el portavoz de la Fundación, José Carnero, hay que investigar para prevenirla. "A nivel estadístico, es algo que sigue avanzando en número y es preocupante. Cada día hay más diagnósticos. Casi un niño al día en España es diagnosticado de esta enfermedad, y es algo que sigue creciendo. La investigación es la única forma de trabajar en la cura y este tipo de avance abre una nueva búsqueda que es la prevención para ese diagnóstico", asegura. En España se registran cada año unos 350 casos de leucemia en niños y, aunque el 80% de ellos se cura, sigue siendo el tipo de cáncer que más muertes ocasiona.

Both sides came out of the traps looking to stamp their authority on the second half but play was scrappy and neither team could retain the ball.                                                                    On 52 minutes the referee produced a yellow card and Beckenham lost a man to the sin-bin. With the numerical advantage Blues made progress up the pitch and went through a series of pick and goes on the opposition 5m line before losing the ball.                                                                    Nick Blount’s pass found Rhys Thompson, whose offload created the overlap for Tyrese Makasi to race clear, but the referee judged the pass to be forward.

The Finding Our Roots African-American Museum, which will celebrate its third anniversary next month, has already made significant contributions to the knowledge of the area's black history and the history of Terrebonne and Lafourche overall. Its director, Margie Scoby, delivered another milestone Saturday in a presentation to the Terrebonne Genealogical Society.                                                          She revealed her research that found ties between black families in Terrebonne Parish and one of the nation's founding fathers, Thomas Jefferson.                                                          Scoby detailed how one of Jefferson's slaves, Susan Randolph, was sold with her children after his death by the former president's grandson, Thomas Randolph, in an effort to lift the estate out of debt. Susan was sent from Virginia to Terrebonne to be enslaved by Woodland and Ashland plantation owner James Cage. Susan was registered as Cage's concubine and had at least four children. While the former slave of Thomas Jefferson lived on the plantation, Scoby followed the other Woodland slaves joined by Susan, including the Lewis, Hite, Lyons, Reason and Dumas families of Terrebonne Parish.                                                          "When you do the research, it gives you an idea of where you are and where you came (from)," Scoby said. "To say that Thomas Jefferson once owned those people then you know the history of the country. ... It tells you that we had people in powerful positions that took part in this slave trade."                                                          Members of those families went on to make strides in the black community, including John Westley Hite, who donated the land for Terrebonne's first black public school, and Joseph Vance Lewis, who was admitted to practice law before the U.S. Supreme Court.                                                          "It tells a history of my people in a powerful way. ... It tells me that they were courageous," Scoby said. "When you find that the people that came out were victorious, it's wonderful."                                                          Earlier, Scoby and the museum helped local residents trace their roots to slaves sold by Georgetown University, some of whom toiled on plantations in Terrebonne and surrounding parishes.                                                          These are monumental findings that required those involved to make an emotional journey into a horrific past, when slavery, bondage, racism and discrimination were the legally and socially accepted norm. Understanding that history is critical for everyone; learning from past mistakes is essential to prevent them from happening again.                                                          Our community is indebted to Scoby and her team at the Finding Our Roots African American Museum for adding new and important chapters to the story of Terrebonne and Lafourche.                                                          -- Editorials represent the opinion of this newspaper and not any single individual.

She said the foundation’s mission is to assist the school district in facilitating educational environments that are state of the art. Current projects include construction of the soccer field house and improvement of the middle school stage. The foundation also awards two $500 scholarships each year to Fredericktown seniors. Future projects include the overhaul of the high school track.                                                          Kline said these projects would not be possible without the assistance of the community. She asked for individuals and businesses who are interested to consider pledging or donating to the Fredericktown Foundation. A link for the foundation can be found on the school website fpsk12.org/ or you can go directly to blackcatpride.net/donate                                                          “We are so appreciative of Cap America and the Page family for their continuing generosity to R-I District and our community,” R-I Superintendent Brett Reutzel said. “It is a bit overwhelming. Mr. Page came to us about a month ago with this idea of a continuing gift to help us replace our high school track. We could not have been more moved by this gesture. We are thankful not only for the gifts of the Cap America family but all of those who have made donations to the Fredericktown Foundation. With this support, we have been able to address several needs in the district that otherwise would not have been possible.”

But a new program like this is bound to have a few growing pains, according to Coun. Michele Babchuk, especially when it involves this number of applications and this kind of money, saying the discrepancy between what is being given out and what was budgeted was due to a "calculation error," and in the future, she's confident the city will be staying within the $100,000 annual budget for the program.

"I often refer to my art as a productive meditation," Wagner said. "The pieces come together, mostly by way of shape, color and shadows. I get lost when I'm collaging, often surprised as anyone at the finished product."                                                  Wagner said the art really just flows out of her. She said inspiration often comes from nature which she likes to juxtapose with architecture and the human form.                                                  "Anything paper is fair game," Wagner said. "I just ripped a page out of a cookbook I received for Christmas."                                                  Wagner said the creation of one of her art pieces can take mere minutes or up to three hours or so.                                                  "Collaging is a very affordable art form, as all of my materials are recycled," Wagner said. "My style has evolved over the years with the first piece being of many small torn pieces and now I make more precise cuts and the sewing atop the paper is new since late 2018."                                                  Wagner said art has always been an emotional outlet for her, and she was kind of surprised when others wanted prints.                                                  "I understood my friends wanting them, as a memento from me, but strangers," Wagner said. "What I hope for people to gain is that art is for everyone. Art should be everywhere. To create is one of the more enjoyable things, if you're not too hard on yourself."
