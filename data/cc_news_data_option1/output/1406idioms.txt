OTTAWA -- Parliament will be recalled Saturday to vote on the Trudeau government's $73-billion emergency wage subsidy program to help businesses through the COVID-19 crisis.
 Government House leader Pablo Rodriguez wrote Thursday to House of Commons Speaker Anthony Rota to request that the chamber be recalled to deal with the legislation necessary to implement the massive program.
 The Senate is also being recalled the same day.
 As part of the countrywide effort to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus, Parliament has been adjourned since March 13, except for a brief sitting of fewer than three dozen MPs two weeks ago to pass the first phase of emergency aid to individuals and businesses.
 Only a handful of MPs and senators, primarily those within driving distance of the capital, are expected to be present in their respective chambers on Saturday -- similar to the manner in which the first aid bill was handled.
 The government must have unanimous consent of all parties in order to pass the bill in a few hours on a single day, bypassing the usual lengthy legislative process. To that end, the government provided opposition parties with a draft of the bill on Monday and had been negotiating with them since then over the fine print.
 However, the negotiations had bogged down over the issue of how to hold the government to account over the longer term. It was not immediately clear Thursday how -- or if -- that impasse between the governing Liberals and the Conservatives was resolved.
 In a letter to Trudeau earlier Thursday, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer outlined his party's position that the Commons should sit with a small number of MPs, with "regular" opportunities for them to grill the prime minister "as we would normally during question period." He also said that Commons committees should begin holding meetings again, where MPs can present motions, call witnesses and question ministers and officials.
 Among other things, the Conservatives want Parliament to sit four days a week, in person, though Scheer said Thursday they'd be open to adding virtual sessions on top of that.
 "If the government has a counterproposal, if they have a rationale for why four sessions a week are not possible, we're open to hearing that rationale and we're open to hearing alternative measures," he told a news conference in Regina.
 "But this is something we believe will benefit Canadians."
 Scheer also said his party supports the program and wants to improve it, but argued the bill does not require urgent assent. He noted the government has said getting the package out will take as long as six weeks, and the back-end infrastructure needed is already being put in place.
 For his part, Trudeau agreed it's essential that Parliament continue to hold the government to account during the crisis but he argued that virtual sittings would be better than having MPs gather in person in the Commons.
 Having even a small number of MPs meet regularly in person would still require "a significant number of support staff" to come to work at a time when all Canadians are being advised to stay home and avoid contact with others as much as possible, Trudeau said.
 As well, he said it wouldn't allow the vast majority of MPs who don't live within driving distance of Ottawa to participate and give voice to the concerns of their constituents.
 On Wednesday, Speaker Rota advised Rodriguez that he's asked the Commons administration to work on setting up a virtual House of Commons, with the goal of having it up and running within four weeks.
 Trudeau urged the Opposition not to tie the longer-term issue of how Parliament should function to the urgently needed wage subsidy bill.
 "It's really important that parliamentarians get together to make sure the work of getting the help to Canadians happens and happens quickly while these continued conversations about furthering our democracy in this moment of crisis continue," he said Thursday.
 "It's not the time to further delay getting help to Canadians."
 The Bloc Quebecois, NDP and Greens were all on side with passing the wage subsidy bill quickly and dealing separately with the longer-term issue of how Parliament should function during the crisis.

The Small Business Administration and the Treasury Department, which are overseeing the loans program, didn’t respond to requests for comment about the online lenders. S.B.A. officials have said they are working to iron out any issues slowing the flow of money to business owners.
 The lenders want to help distribute the $349 billion in loans the government is giving to small businesses to help them make payroll and cover other costs during the pandemic. The loans have generous terms, including a low interest rate and forgiveness for portions spent on fixed costs like rent and paychecks for employees who aren’t working.
 The government has so far relied on traditional banks, like Wells Fargo and Bank of America, to distribute the loans alongside smaller community institutions. The banks have obtained approval for $95 billion of loans, leading lawmakers to discuss adding more money to the program.
 But these large financial institutions have mostly been willing to work only with existing customers, making it hard for small enterprises that did not previously have accounts with the banks. Banks also tend to rely on paperwork and manual processes that can take days.
 In part because of the cost of working with these loans, banks have taken a step back from lending to small businesses over the last decade, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.
 That provided an opening for online lenders, which have focused on automating the documentation and approval processes to reduce costs and make it faster. More than 25 such companies have gotten funding from venture capitalists, according to Pitchbook. Those numbers don’t include large financial technology companies like PayPal, Square and Stripe, which have also pushed into lending to small businesses.
 Online lenders are a small part of the financial industry. But last year, they were the biggest source of loans for small businesses with medium and low credit profiles, according to data released this week by the Federal Reserve.
 Brock Blake, the chief executive of Lendio, a website that works with online lenders and traditional banks, said that where traditional banks generally took at least a week to approve loans, online lenders could almost always do it within an hour.
 Lawmakers have noticed the start-ups’ absence. Senator Marco Rubio, the Florida Republican who is chairman of the Senate’s small business subcommittee, has raised concerns about their slowness to participate in the program.
 “To not leave behind underserved communities and those whose banks won’t help them, we need to get nonbank lenders, including fintechs, into the program as soon as possible,” Mr. Rubio said in a statement on Thursday. He said he was glad the Treasury Department had released the application for the companies and was “pushing to put that on a fast track.”
 Online lenders are desperate to take part in the program because their business has largely dried up in the pandemic. What’s more, with attractive loans available from the government, few small businesses want any other kind.
 The chief executive of Toast, which focuses on lending to restaurants, said in a letter this week that it was laying off or furloughing half of its employees. Kabbage made even larger cuts last month, according to Bloomberg. The price of shares in OnDeck, a publicly traded competitor, have dropped more than 50 percent.
 The government loans are unlikely to be great moneymakers. Small businesses will pay almost no interest, and lenders will get a 5 percent fee from the government for any loans they originate.
 The companies have lobbied aggressively to take part, asking Congress to allow them to participate and then pushing the agencies to issue guidance making it clear they would be included.
 While waiting for approval, some of the tech companies have tried to figure out workarounds. Kabbage and PayPal have teamed up with banks to process loans for them.
 Kabbage said it had already gotten 40,000 applications requesting $4 billion in loans. That allowed it to bring back some of its furloughed workers, but company executives said they would be able to do more robust business with full approval.
 If they start distributing money on their own, online lenders may encounter the same difficulties that have hit their traditional competitors. While the start-ups can approve loans quickly, they have to process the applications with the Small Business Administration, and an S.B.A processing system has slowed down under the weight of the applications.

Alex Dyer has told his Kilmarnock side they do not have time to sulk about Wednesday’s extra-time collapse ahead of their trip to Celtic on Sunday.
 Killie thought they were on the verge the William Hill Scottish Cup quarter- finals as they played out a thrilling Rugby Park replay with Aberdeen.
 They led the Dons 3-2 with just a few minutes left of the additional half hour but were left stunned as Derek McInnes’ team snatched victory at the death after Sam Cosgrove’s penalty was followed up by an own goal from Connor Johnson.
 It was a cruel defeat but Dyer knows his side cannot afford to let confidence levels sag as they prepare to take on Neil Lennon’s merciless Ladbrokes Premiership leaders this weekend.
 He said: “We’ve got another game – a tough game – on Sunday. Yes the boys are obviously down but we have to move on from the other night and move on quickly.
 “There are a lot of lessons to be learned. It’s a night that we have to put to bed but we will learn. I will learn from it too as manager.
 “The boys are usually good at closing out games but it wasn’t to be on Wednesday.
 “We got caught up in the emotions a little bit and we have to learn from that lesson.
 “But I believe we can go to Celtic Park and get a result.
 “Whether it’s a win or a draw, I believe there’s enough in that changing room to get something this weekend.
 “I have to believe that or it’s not worth doing the job.
 “Hard work will be key and we’ll need the players to be on the money as we’re facing a good side.
 “But it’s about us doing the right things at the right time and not feeling sorry for ourselves because we’re not in the next round of the cup.”

If you're wondering how someone could weather so much negative press and not see a drop in followers, you're not alone. Fashion industry watchdog Diet Prada was curious too and used a "top social media tracking program" to take a closer look at how Charnas' follower count had changed. What they found was that while Charnas had been steadily losing followers from the end of March through the first week of April (about 3000 total), she managed to make up for that loss and then some when she gained 6,364 followers on April 6, despite not having posted any new content for a number of days.

Bart Bowen and his staff held out for as long as they could, but they just could not wait any longer.
 The Cascade Cycling Classic, scheduled for May 27-31, was canceled Thursday due to the coronavirus pandemic, said Bowen, race director for the event, which draws professional and amateur bike riders for stages across Central Oregon.
 "This is an event that brings people together," Bowen said. "Right now, as much as we want to do that, there's just too many unknowns. And that would take away from the race and the racers. Everybody wants to get back out and enjoy what they love to do. But travel, etc., there's a lot of pieces that make for uncertainty with the event."
 Bowen considered postponing the stage race to August or September and running a scaled-down version of the event, he said. Ultimately, he decided that would not be worthy of the 40th edition of the Cascade Classic, an event with a rich tradition and history in Central Oregon. The 40th edition will now be staged June 2-6, 2021.
 The race includes hundreds of cyclists from teams across the West and hundreds of fans and volunteers who typically show up in Bend for the Twilight Criterium stage. Race organizers determined they could not ensure this year’s race would be financially viable, nor could they ensure the health and safety of the Central Oregon community, racers and volunteers.
 Bowen had brought the race back under his leadership in 2019 after a hiatus in 2018 as the event changed ownership. The 2019 event, organized by Bowen's newly formed Cascade Cycling Classic Youth Foundation nonprofit, was by most accounts a success.
 So now to miss another year is a tough for Bowen and other CCC organizers.
 "That was probably the thing that was the hardest to come to grips with," Bowen said. "We really, really wanted to have this 40th edition so badly. And that's why we've been holding off and kind of keeping our fingers' crossed. There was some talk of paring it down and just having a mini version. But the draw for our sponsors and our community is to do what our vision was last year, which was so successful. Without that I feel like we would be going through the motions."
 Last year's event featured a cycling festival with youth activities to bring the community together on the day of the most popular stage, the Twilight Criterium.
 "It's not just to put on another bike race," Bowen said. "It's really to create this community event that everyone can participate in, whether you're a pro or you're a kid on a strider bike on a course we set up for you. That's what it's all about. If you take away those pieces, it's not worthy of the 40th edition. I just think about how critical the fans and the atmosphere are to having a successful event."
 Bowen said he had spoken with USA Cycling, sponsors, and agencies involved in the race on a potential postponement to late summer or fall. But there are just too many entities involved in a multi-day stage race across numerous roads in Central Oregon to make a postponement feasible.
 "We're working with the cities, the counties, the police," Bowen said . "When it's all good conditions it's hard enough. But right now there's just so much uncertainty with the police force being tapped and stuff. People may not realize all the infrastructure it takes to put on a race that is multiple days, that requires medical assistance and a lot of volunteers."
 The CCC was North America's longest consecutively running cycling stage race until its hiatus in 2018. The race was typically held each July through 2017. Bowen and the CCC Youth Foundation took over ownership of the event from Mt. Bachelor Sports Education, and staged the race last year in late May and early June, promoting a festival-like atmosphere.
 The 2020 Cascade Classic was to include most of the same stages as the 2019 version, including road races in and around Tumalo, the Painted Hills, Sisters and Bend. The Twilight Criterium and Festival was again scheduled for streets near McKay Park in southwest Bend.
 Many USA Cycling races through June have been canceled and a few have been postponed until fall. The Tour of Utah, scheduled for Aug. 3-9 and the biggest cycling race in the country, has been canceled.
 Bowen said he was meeting with his staff on Thursday to continue plans for the next Cascade Cycling Classic in June 2021.
 "We can now take some time, step back, and see if there's anything different we can do for 2021," Bowen said. "It's the 40th edition, and we'd like to come back with a bang and make it great for the community and great for the kids on bikes, and have a cycling festival that people don't forget."

A Republican US senator introduced legislation on Thursday to remove American troops from Saudi Arabia, adding pressure on the kingdom to tighten its oil taps to reverse the crude price drop that has hurt domestic energy companies.
 The legislation from Senator Bill Cassidy, of oil-producing Louisiana, would remove US troops 30 days after enactment, a full month faster than similar legislation introduced by two other Republican senators in March.
 Cassidy introduced the bill as OPEC+, a production group including Saudi Arabia and others in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies including Russia, closed in on a deal to slash oil output by a record amount of about 15 million barrels, or 15% of global production.
 The spread of the coronavirus has crushed crude demand at the same time that Saudi Arabia and Russia have pumped oil flat- out in a race for market share, pushing prices to 18-year lows.
 The extra oil from Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter, has made it impossible for energy companies in the United States, the world's top oil and gas producer, to compete, Cassidy said.
 "Withdrawing troops placed to protect others recognizes that friendship and support is a two-way street," he said.
 Cassidy's bill faces an uphill battle and would have to pass the Senate, the House of Representatives and be signed by President Donald Trump to become law. Still, it was a sign of how Congress could take action against Saudi Arabia if it does not stick to the plan to cut oil output.
 The bill would also place tariffs on imports of oil from Saudi Arabia within 10 days of enactment. The tariff would ensure that the price of oil imports from Saudi Arabia would not be less than $40 a barrel, the bill said.
 Trump has threatened tariffs on oil imports from Saudi Arabia and Russia but has not imposed them amid opposition from powerful energy interests, including the American Petroleum Institute lobbying group.
 The bill would not remove US Patriot missiles or THAAD defense systems, as the previous legislation would.
 Congress is out until at least April 20 and possibly longer due to the coronavirus outbreak.

Not on the ballot
   
 Recent columns by state representatives Jason Probst and Paul Waggoner provided confirmation of why Kansans will not have an anti-abortion amendment on the ballot this year.
   
 In his March 8 column, Probst stated that revising the proposed amendment to be voted on in the November general election rather than the August political party primary would have garnered at least three of the four additional house votes required for passage. Permitting abortion when the mother's life is in danger would have added more votes.
   
 The proposed amendment could have been revised, passed and put on the ballot, but those in political control of the legislature made no such revisions.
   
 We can be confident of this because in his March 22 column, Waggoner said nothing to dispute Probst's assertions. If they were false, Waggoner certainly would not have hesitated to say, but he did not.
   
 Instead he criticized fellow legislators who do not subscribe to the pro- income tax cut lobby that helped increase our tax supported debt by 40% from 2010 to nearly $4.5 billion by 2017. He confirmed the suspicion of political observers that the purpose of placing the amendment in the August primary was to help the pro-income tax lobby better target non-compliant legislators.
   
 It is worth repeating. The reason Kansans do not have the opportunity to vote on an anti-abortion amendment is not because of the minority of legislators that oppose it. It is because of political party bosses that control the legislature. Probst and Waggoner confirmed it.

“The calculation is, this base has nowhere to go but Biden because of Trump," she said. "But if history teaches anything, a lot of the base sat it out last time.”
 Demoro noted that, after 2016, many Sanders supporters knew he would try again for the presidency four years later. That seems unlikely going forward, potentially raising the profile of rising-star congressional progressives such as New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who endorsed Sanders, and Massachusetts Rep. Ayanna Pressley, who was a Warren backer.
 Though he's suspended his campaign, Sanders' name will remain on the ballot in states that have not yet weighed in on the primary. He said Wednesday he still wants to collect delegates to influence the party platform.
 Sanders and Warren have also notably stopped short of endorsing Biden.
 Maurice Mitchell, national director of the Working Families Party, which backed Warren before shifting its support to Sanders when she dropped out, said Biden's goal is to rebuild the Obama coalition, which spanned generations, races and education levels. But he said Biden won't be able to do that without attracting the support of “young people committed to real, progressive change” who were most enthusiastic about Sanders.
 “The question is, will Joe Biden increase voter turnout, be able achieve significant levels of voter enthusiasm, be able to achieve significant levels of individual volunteerism and small dollar donations and the type of enthusiastic voter to voter communication?” Mitchell asked.

Mikel Arteta has revealed the families of his Arsenal players are “concerned” by the ongoing coronavirus outbreak.
 Fixtures on the continent have already started to fall foul of the virus as countries battle to contain it.
 Five Serie A games will be played behind closed doors this weekend, while the Swiss Super League has postponed their matches.
 English football has yet to suffer but some clubs have instructed players not to shake hands while the likes of Arsenal and Tottenham have issued forms to visitors to their training ground in an attempt to prevent potential cases.
 Arteta said he and his squad will continue to follow medical advice but did concede there are worries from the families of those players who are based overseas.
 “(We are) not anxious, obviously we read the information, it’s all the time in the media,” he said. “Our families are concerned, we have a lot of foreign players with foreign families in different countries so it’s something that is on a daily basis.
 “The club and the authorities are in contact every day. We are following all the instructions from the club doctor.
 “So far the protocols we have been doing are enough but obviously don’t know to what stage it is going to develop.
 “We’ve seen in other countries the difficult decisions they have to make around it to protect the situation so we have to wait and see and be guided by them.”
 Sheer fixture congestion seems to be more of a pressing worry for Arteta as he prepares his side for their FA Cup fifth-round clash at Portsmouth on Monday night.
 After crashing out of the Europa League to Olympiacos with the last kick of extra-time on Thursday night, Arteta knows the pressure is on to take the club into European competition for next season.
 Sitting ninth in the Premier League heading into the weekend’s fixtures, the FA Cup could yet be the tournament to provide Arteta with a route to the Europa League.
 With the FA Cup ties being moved to midweek there is a level of congestion in the coming weeks after the first-ever Premier League winter break earlier in the year.
 Arteta believes, with Carabao Cup fixtures also in the mix, there is too much strain being placed on the modern player.
 “We’re not going to please everyone with the decisions that have to be made,” the Spaniard replied when asked about fixture congestion.
 “What is for sure is that for players it’s an enormous amount of games. The intensity is raising every single year, the level of pressure too, and sometimes it’s too much for them.
 “Something has to be done because you can see players are cracking and cracking every season.
 “You can sustain that for one season, two seasons, but after three or four seasons you end up paying the price and I think the quality at some stage will drop.
 “But as well we have a history, a massive culture here with the cup games, and to go against that is difficult.”

WASHINGTON -- Both private- and public-sector initiatives are needed to help the world's poorest countries grapple with debt challenges exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic, the Institute of International Finance said on Thursday.
 The IIF signaled its support for a push by the World Bank and International Monetary Fund for official bilateral creditors to suspend debt payments for the poorest countries in a letter to the World Bank, the IMF, the OECD and Paris Club creditors.
 The letter from the group, which includes over 450 banks, hedge funds and other global financial firms, signals growing momentum in support of steps to ease the debt burden of the poorest countries, which will be hit hardest by the pandemic.
 IIF President Timothy Adams said both official and private creditors should commit to debt payment forbearance for those countries for a specific period of time, such as six months or through the end of 2020, without waiving payment obligation.
 In addition, all types of private creditors and obligations should be treated alike, both foreign and domestic, whether the obligations were in foreign or local currencies, Adams wrote.
 IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva on Thursday said the pandemic would trigger a deep recession in 2020, with emerging markets and developing countries likely to need hundreds of billions of dollars in foreign aid.
 She said the IMF stood ready to make its $1 trillion in lending power available and had $100 billion in emergency funding to disburse rapidly to countries that need it.
 Together with credits from the IMF and other international financial institutions, a moratorium on debt payments "would provide urgently needed relief during this health and humanitarian crisis," Adams wrote.
 Tim Jones, head of policy at Jubilee Debt Campaign, a UK charity working to end poverty, welcomed the IIF's support for a suspension of debt payments but said such payments should be outright through year's end rather then just deferred.
 "Suspensions just kick the can down the road, laying the ground for an even bigger debt crisis in the future," he said.
 Adams said stakeholders could use further tools to address the record level of global debt and other issues once the crisis abated, urging greater coordination among multilateral, bilateral and commercial lenders.
 To ease the process, he suggested more frequent meetings of the Paris Club of official creditors with private creditors and urged the Group of 20 major economies to bring the Paris Club together with non-Paris Club bilateral lenders, such as China.
 The IIF estimates that International Development Association countries, the world's poorest, face general government debt service obligations of some $140 billion through the end of the year, which includes debt raised on domestic bond markets.
 Servicing and managing those obligations will be "close to impossible" for vulnerable countries facing acute healthcare and humanitarian challenges, underscoring the need for public- and private-sector initiatives, Adams said.
 The IIF also mapped out key principles for work on debt issues, including recognition that the creditor base for low-income countries had shifted from bilateral and multilateral lenders to much greater reliance on China, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and other non-Paris club bilateral lenders and commercial creditors.

Lewis Ferguson’s exquisite finish sent Aberdeen on the way to their ninth semi-final in seven seasons under Derek McInnes.
 Ferguson struck with the outside of the boot in the seventh minute before substitute Sam Cosgrove’s stoppage-time penalty sealed a 2-0 William Hill Scottish Cup victory over St Mirren in Paisley.
 St Mirren paid for a slow start as Aberdeen gave away nothing at the back to hold on and book their place at Hampden in early April.
 The only down side for the visitors was a hamstring injury for Scott McKenna – hours after his fellow Scotland centre-back John Souttar suffered a serious Achilles injury during Hearts’ win over Rangers.
 Aberdeen threatened in the opening moments when Curtis Main headed just wide from Dean Campbell’s free-kick.
 The visiting fans celebrated confirmation of Rangers’ exit from the tournament and they were soon cheering again as their team went in front.
 Matty Kennedy picked up a loose ball on the halfway line, drove forward and passed inside for Ferguson, who took a couple of strides and guided the ball through a narrow gap into the near top corner.
 St Mirren could not impose themselves on the game at all in the opening half hour and their only glimpse of goal in the first half came in the final minute. Centre-back Conor McCarthy brought down Cammy MacPherson’s free-kick 10 yards out but Aberdeen goalkeeper Joe Lewis got to the ball before him.
 The hosts replaced striker Alex Jakubiak with winger Kyle McAllister at half- time and started on the front foot. Aberdeen lost McKenna seven minutes in with Michael Devlin taking his place.
 Aberdeen almost killed off the contest when Main netted with a diving header from Niall McGinn’s cross but the striker was flagged offside in a very close call.
 Lewis made his first save just after the hour mark when he pushed away Jamie McGrath’s curling effort from long range and St Mirren, with McAllister probing for openings, were dominating possession.
 Saints boss Jim Goodwin sent on January signing Seifedin Chabbi for his debut but the home side still struggled to find a cutting edge.
 Dons substitute Sam Cosgrove missed a decent chance with two minutes remaining but he soon got his goal.
 McCarthy gave the ball away deep inside his own half and Sam Foley pulled Cosgrove down. The striker slotted home to continue his record of scoring a penalty in each round of the tournament.

Los gatos y los perros, cuya carne es consumida por una minoría de chinos, han sido excluidos por primera vez de una lista oficial de animales comestibles que debe ser objeto de una reglamentación. El texto, sometido a comentarios hasta el 8 de mayo, fue publicado el miércoles por el ministerio de Agricultura y Asuntos Rurales y enumera los animales que pueden ser criados para su carne, su piel o con fines médicos, excluyendo perros y gatos. El consumo de esos animales de compañia es legal, pero es extremadamente minoritario y suscita una creciente oposición. “Es la primera vez que el gobierno chino dice que los gatos y los perros son mascotas y no están destinados al consumo”, dijo el jueves en un comunicado la asociación estadounidense Human Society International (HSI). Esta última estima que cada año se matan 10 millones de perros en China por su carne. Miles son sacrificados durante el festival de la carne de perro de Yulin (sur), en condiciones consideradas crueles por los defensores de los animales, ya que son golpeados hasta la muerte e incluso hervidos vivos. Esta decisión se produce tras la prohibición en febrero del comercio y el consumo de animales salvajes, una práctica sospechosa en la propagación del nuevo coronavirus. El comercio de animales silvestres también había sido prohibido durante la crisis del SRAS (Síndrome Respiratorio Agudo Severo) en 2002-2003, un coronavirus cuya transmisión también se había relacionado con el consumo de animales salvajes. Sin embargo, superada aquella epidemia el comercio se había reanudado rápidamente.

“Senator Sanders and his supporters can take pride in their work in laying the groundwork for these ideas,” Biden wrote in an online post announcing what he called “two important steps we can take to help ease the economic burden on working people.”
 Neither proposal goes as far as Sanders promised had he won the presidency. And they may not be enough to convince supporters of the Vermont senator to embrace Biden.
 “We can try all we want to use our leverage as a movement but, at the end of the day, I wouldn’t expect anything coming from the establishment, the Biden campaign or the Democratic National Committee as a way to bring in the base,” said Nomiki Konst, who worked on Democratic Party reforms on Sanders' behalf. “I think they want power — and I think they want money.”
 If Biden can't bridge the ideological divide, he risks heading into the fall with the same vulnerabilities as Hillary Clinton in 2016. But if he gives too much to progressives, he could be portrayed as too far left, an argument the Trump campaign is already trying to make.
 Despite Thursday's moves, Biden has signaled he's not willing to make concessions on the most important issues in the minds of many Sanders' supporters: embracing Medicare for All universal health insurance and the sweeping Green New Deal to combat climate change. He has, however, embraced an overhaul of bankruptcy laws proposed by Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the other leading progressive, who ended her presidential bid last month.
 RoseAnn Demoro, a close friend of Sanders and former head of the National Nurses United union, predicted Biden would also move to appease Sanders supporters on labor and environmental issues — but said she's unsure it'll be enough.

More than a century ago, the prairie lands of Kansas were dotted with the massive bodies of buffalo.
   
 There were herds of bison that provided sustenance and pelts to the Native American tribes of the plains. In 1886, the last North American buffalo were killed in Kansas. The great beasts that numbered in the millions were taken down to nothing in just a couple decades, according to the Kansas Historical Society.
   
 In 2009, Jo and Shawn Rolph brought a little piece of history back to the heart of Solomon Valley in Delphos. They opened the Dry Creek Buffalo Ranch at 1052 Ute Road, with seven heifers and one bull.
   
 "We were interested and always had been in livestock, so we came up with the idea to raise buffalo," Shawn Rolph said.
   
 Today, that small herd is up to 50 head and still growing on more than 70 acres of land. They'll be calfing soon and adding to their numbers.
   
 While the herd was a dream of the couple, it hasn't always been their lot in life. Shawn graduated from high school in Minneapolis, Kan. From there, he went on to college and met Jo. Both were pursuing futures in law enforcement. They spent several years in Manhattan before retiring from law enforcement, as well as mechanical contracting.
   
 Eventually they decided going home might just be a good plan for their retirement. Although his father had died and his mom had moved, he still had aunts and uncles in the area.
   
 "I'm a small-town boy, I got a hankering to come home," Shawn said.
   
 So he spoke with one of his uncles who happened to own some ground that hadn't been worked in more than 28 years.
   
 "Talked to him and he pretty much gave us the green light and we were crazy enough to raise buffalo," Shawn said. "So we came back. The land was overgrown so we had to clear it and put a new fence up. Now we raise buffalo."
   
 So what does raising bison entail? A lot of hard work and elbow grease. The animals and their surroundings are in constant need of maintenance. With their girth, they aren't easily contained, so fences constantly need mending. They are always in need of clean water. In the winter, there isn't grass to sustain them, so hay is necessary to feed them. Then there are mineral blocks to be put out. Not to mention if they get loose, a specific group of people is called upon to help round them up.
   
 "The buffalo are a handful always," Shawn said. "They just gotta be babysat. They say you don't have to do much with them but we usually have somebody with them most of the time."
   
 Unlike cattle, these beasts aren't very tame. They can't be walked among and you can't easily mingle with them.
   
 "If you get too close to a calf, the mom will come after you." Shawn explained. "If she comes after you then everybody else comes after you too."
   
 It's not all hard work though, as there is something to be gained from the herd. Every Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, the Dry Creek Buffalo Ranch and Chuckwagon food truck can be found in the surrounding communities. On Mondays they serve Delphos, Tuesdays they go to Glasco and Wednesdays they go to Minneapolis. They set up at fairs and festivals and eventually they hope to spend a day during the week in Salina.
   
 "It's been great," Jo said. "For fairs and festivals, we were booked up from the end of March to the last weekend in October."
   
 At the Smoky Hill River Festival alone, the Chuckwagon is manned by a crew of at least five. They get the whole family involved. This crew serves up 500 pounds of meat. This is the weight of one full-sized animal.
   
 That's not all. The Rolphs offer the public some unique experiences on the ranch itself. Tours with the buffalo are an option. The herd can be observed from a hay ride tour or a hiking tour in the surrounding timber. After, visitors can enjoy a buffalo meal from the truck.
   
 "We started giving tours this year," Jo said. "We had been planning on giving tours and it just finally worked out to be able to do it and iron things out to do it our way."
   
 The ranch also sells meat. Buffalo meat can be purchased by the pound, or a half or whole animal can be bought.
   
 According to American Gourmet, bison is one of the most nutritious meats available. With a low calorie count, a quarter pound of bison meat contains only 146 calories. By comparison, that size of serving of lean ground beef contains 176 calories. Pork contains 218 and turkey contains 149 calories. Not even venison can hold its own against bison, as it contains 158 calories.
   
 Bison is exceptionally lean with one serving containing only 7.21 grams of fat and 55 milligrams of cholesterol. On the nutrient side, it contains higher amounts of protein, iron and Vitamin B-12. The meat is also used often as a dietary substitute for those with food allergies, as it contains fewer artificial antibiotics, hormones and steroids.
   
 The Rolphs also offer a catering service that can be customized to accommodate any number of events. The meat comes from the animals on the ranch. They are put down, then transferred to a butcher in Riley for processing. A meat inspector is there to check out the meat and ensure its quality.
   
 "It's a great deal as we do not have a lot of choices around here, so this gives us another option to choose from," said Delphos resident Jim Klein.
   
 The Rolphs' piece of history continues to grow with the help of their family. The coming years will bring much as they plan to expand their services and show the beauty in bison to people everywhere.

Aberdeen skipper Joe Lewis admits he is jealous of his predecessors who have lifted silverware for the Dons.
 Russell Anderson was the last Aberdeen captain to hold a trophy aloft when he collected the League Cup in 2014 in Derek McInnes’ first season in charge.
 Lewis joined the Dons two years later and has played at Hampden Park eight times but has suffered three final defeats against Celtic.
 Aberdeen can secure a return to Mount Florida if they beat St Mirren in the William Hill Scottish Cup quarter-finals on Saturday night and Lewis has plenty of motivation ahead of the Paisley tie.
 “There’s lads in the changing room who have won the League Cup only a few years ago and certainly myself and the other lads that have joined more recently than that want to be part of a team that’s won a trophy at this football club,” the 32-year-old said.
 “I’m envious of the photos and the celebrations of winning a trophy and I would love to get my hands on a trophy and lifting that with the team beside me.
 “It is a massive game for us. It’s a great opportunity to get silverware.
 “The league and the League Cup have come and gone for us and this is the last opportunity for us to win silverware this season.
 “It’s something Aberdeen Football Club should be doing, we should be winning trophies.
 “It’s something that I have had a strong desire to do since I have been at the club. Saturday is the next step towards achieving that.
 “We have got the opportunity to get into the semi-final and we will go down there with that hunger and determination to do that.”
 St Mirren did Aberdeen a favour on Tuesday by beating Motherwell, who could have gone four points clear of the fourth-placed Dons in the Ladbrokes Premiership table.
 But the Buddies’ follow-up to their Fir Park cup win seven days earlier also gave them a lift ahead of Saturday night’s encounter.
 Lewis said: “They will be confident on the back of an excellent result on Tuesday night. It’s a difficult place to go against a very good team in Motherwell.
 “When we have played them, they have been a real tough, determined lot and we expect nothing different.
 “We need a performance that will get us through that.”
