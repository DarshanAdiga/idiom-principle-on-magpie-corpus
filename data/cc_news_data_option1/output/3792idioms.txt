DEAD POETS SOCIETY (1989)
 I had an eighth-grade teacher who would stand on desks and shout in class. He was scarily intimidating and wonderfully engaging all at the same time - much like Robin William's character in "Dead Poets Society." A Washington Post reviewer praised Williams for giving a "nicely restrained acting performance" for his role in the 1989 drama, which has since been widely recognized as one of the actor/comedian's best (and also earned him an Oscar nomination).
 Set in 1959, Williams' character, John Keating, is a new English teacher at Welton Academy, an all-male, elite prep school. The students are surprised by Keating's unorthodox teaching methods (like standing on desks, ripping pages from poetry books, etc.). A Welton alumnus himself, he encourages his students to "make your lives extraordinary," a sentiment he summarizes with the Latin expression carpe diem, which means to "seize the day." He made his lessons interesting, engaging and dared his students to walk their own paths, which of course, ruffles the feathers of parents and the headmaster. The "O Captain, my Captain!" scene alone is worth watching the movie for.

 THE CRAFT' (1996)
 The handsome and hateable slut-shaming jock. As prominent a trope in high school movies as mean cheerleaders, nerds with glasses and out-of-touch administrators. And don't we all just love it when they get their inevitable comeuppance? In "The Craft," outcast teen witches run amok with pagan ritual- invoked powers and get so far out of hand we're left feeling sorry for the captain of the football team.
 It's a basic walkthrough rectitude, one in which young women - cliche alert! - begin to realize the powers they have, but fail badly in their attempts to use them wisely. "The anti-Clueless," a few reviews called it back in 1994.
 It's a bit darker than your average teen romp but notably touches on issues very real to far too many adolescents, including body image, domestic abuse, racism and poverty. On the flip side: the clothes and the hair and the Goth teen angst, the haunting, aching Morrissey and the striking, psychotic performance of icy-eyed Fairuza Balk - so good that I could never believe her as anything else again?! Sorry for the obviousness, but it's magic.
 After all, who among us could resist employing supernatural solutions to our adolescent problems if we could?

 10 THINGS I HATE ABOUT YOU (1999)
 Centered on the lives of a group of high school students as they try to navigate school and romantic entanglements, "10 Things I Hate About You" is a great back-to-school pick. In an updated adaptation of Shakespeare's "Taming of the Shrew," an all-star cast (Julia Stiles, Gabrielle Union, Joseph Gordon- Levitt and, my favorite male actor, the late Heath Ledger) experiences the typical high school happenings, from detention to soccer practice and prom.
 But it also has a few unreal, yet memorable, plot points, including an overprotective father who makes his daughter wear a pregnancy belly before going to a party, a guidance counselor attempting to write an erotic novel while meeting with students and an epic display of feelings when Patrick Verona (Ledger) dances while singing "Can't Take My Eyes Off You" with the accompaniment of the marching band. And who could forget the scene where Kat Stratford (Stiles) emotionally presents her poem, for which the film gets its title, in front of her class? Plus, it's a movie my husband and I can both agree upon.
 If you're a fan of the film, do yourself a favor and skip the TV series. It's not worth your time.

 SCHOOL OF ROCK (2003)
 "Those that can't do, teach. Those that can't teach, teach gym," said Jack Black while playing washed-up guitarist Dewey Finn. Finding himself in a desperate situation and needing to pay rent, Black poses as a substitute teacher named Mr. Schneebly at a private school.
 In a series of unconventional lessons, Black takes his students on a journey of rock 'n' roll and crazy antics that culminates with an epic battle of the bands near the end of the film. It's a tale filled with music, rock-inspired coming of age, fun and plenty of Jack Black's distinct brand of humor. And despite its PG-13 rating, the film doesn't contain much that an older elementary schooler or young middle schooler couldn't handle.

 The entire "Harry Potter" series(2001-2011)
 The "Harry Potter" movie franchise is full of wizards, spells, monsters, time travel and other curses. But what grounds all the magic in reality _ and makes the characters so relatable _ is that it's also a saga of a misfit adolescent making his way through school. Granted, the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry is no ordinary institution of learning. But the anxieties and triumphs of Harry and his friends brilliantly capture the emotional underpinnings of the psychological battleground that is high school.
 Whether it's excelling at sports, agonizing over finding a date for the formal dance, cramming for exams or dealing with bullies, the "Harry Potter" series is the story of school. And then there are the fantastic _ and not so fantastic _ teachers. From scattered Sybill Trelawney to self-aggrandizing Gilderoy Lockhart, in love with his own voice, to brutally tough Severus Snape, we've all known teachers like these.
 Do I have a favorite school scene? There are so many across the films, it's hard to choose one _ but "Harry Potter and The Prisoner of Azkaban" features a novel example of the time-honored tradition of passing notes in class that always makes me smile. And don't all kids wish they could skip the yellow bus and head back to school on the magical Hogwarts Express?

 # Woman charged with mailing ricin to White House wrote note
 Michael Balsamo and Eric Tucker
 Associated Press
 View Comments
 _Washington_ – A woman accused of mailing a package containing ricin to the White House included a threatening letter in which she told President Donald Trump to “give up and remove your application for this election,” according to court papers filed Tuesday.
 Pascale Ferrier was arrested Sunday at the New York-Canada border and is due to make her first court appearance Tuesday afternoon in federal court in Buffalo, New York.
 The envelope containing the toxic substance and the threatening letter was addressed to the White House but was intercepted at a mail sorting facility on Friday.
 During the investigation, the FBI discovered that six additional similar letters appeared to have been received in Texas in September, according to court papers. Those letters “contained similar language” to the letter that was sent to Trump and were sent to people affiliated with facilities where Ferrier had been jailed in 2019.
 Investigators also matched Ferrier’s fingerprints from four of the letters, the complaint said.
 In Facebook and Twitter posts in September, Ferrier also wrote “#killTrump” and used similar wording as she did in the letter, calling him an “Ugly Clown Tyrant,” according to the document.
 When she was arrested, Ferrier told Customs and Border Patrol agents that she was “wanted by the FBI for the ricin letters,” the complaint said. Officers founded a loaded gun in her waistband and said she was also carrying a knife.

There is some chance that the duopoly of commercial aircraft makers could be broken in a decade and a half. For the time being, the cost to enter the industry must be well into the hundreds of billions of dollars. The only organization that has a whisker of a chance today is China’s state-owned Commercial Aircraft Corporation (COMAC). It wants to build jets so that the world’s largest airplane travel market does not have to rely on America’s Boeing and Europe’s Airbus. Even with the financial weight of the central government behind it, the company has had technical problems. Count it out of the race to build a zero-emission commercial aircraft for now.
 The secret sauce for Airbus’s plans is what it calls “hydrogen propulsion.” Glenn Llewellyn, Airbus VP, Zero-Emission Aircraft, said: “As recently as five years ago, hydrogen propulsion wasn’t even on our radar as a viable emission- reduction technology pathway. But convincing data from other transport industries quickly changed all that. Today, we’re excited by the incredible potential hydrogen offers aviation in terms of disruptive emissions reduction.” Hydrogen-powered engines would reduce commercial aircraft CO2 emissions by half, it calculates.

There is a proportion of the population which is immune, we don't know how big it is because we haven't had those kinds of tests carried out, and what we do know is that if you're under 65, the chances of you suffering any serious difficulties as a result of contracting the virus is very, very small - unless you've got some underlying medical condition, like asthma or diabetes or something of that kind, which weakens your immune system. We shouldn't be worried about this - the only thing that we need to be worried about - which is what justified the original lockdown - was can our health service cope with the numbers of people infected. With 138 people in the entire country in a serious condition in hospital with COVID, of course we can cope. So, the justification for locking down the entire population is zero. This government has made the biggest assault on civil liberties in peacetime in Britain in modern times. This is supposedly a conservative government that believes in people's freedoms; this government, actually, is worse than almost any government in living memory.

"articleBody" : "
 First, the Bombay High Court said that 'we are surprised to find there is no state control over electronic media'. Then the Supreme Court favoured the formation of a committee to set up standards for the media.
 Even if the background of the two orders explains the calls for regulation, the suggested solutions have their own drawbacks. For instance, nothing demonstrated the pitfalls of 'state control' more than the press censorship which was imposed by the Indira Gandhi Government following the proclamation of the Emergency in 1975.
 And no one understood the negative impact of the clampdown more than Indira Gandhi herself when she attributed her defeat in the 1977 general election to the lack of feedback because of the silencing of the media.
 A renewed experiment with such a failed endeavour is, therefore, unwarranted even if the reason for it can appear justified in view of the 'media trial' of some of the accused in the case on the death of a Bollywood actor. Although the shrill presentations by several TV anchors emphasise the need for a restraining measure, there is little doubt that a remedy of this nature can be worse than the disease.
 In any event, the Government's intervention in the realm of free expression militates against the democratic concept and is, therefore, 'ipso facto' unacceptable. Besides, in view of the nation's experience during the Emergency, no government will be willing to go down that road again.
 The hasty withdrawal of the proposed 'Publication of Objectionable Materials Act' by the Rajiv Gandhi Government after a public outcry demonstrated how sensitive the authorities had become about the popular antipathy towards any attempt to muzzle the media.
 If state control is not feasible, so is the idea of a committee for overseeing the media. For a start, it is likely to be regarded as censorship by another name. After all, during the 1975-77 period, such 'committees' of bureaucrats loyal to the party in power if not to the Constitution scrutinised the news items and editorials of the next day's newspapers the night before publication to detect and delete any subversive content in the Government's opinion.
 True, the Supreme Court wants the committee proposed by it to comprise members of 'commendable stature' and not 'persons of politically divisive nature'. But it will not be easy to find people of such impeccable apolitical credentials. It is an impossibility in today's polarised world to find such men and women when the Left and the Right are constantly at loggerheads.
 But, perhaps, it is wrong to blame only the present times for the divisiveness. It has probably always been the case where one man's terrorist is another's freedom fighter. The gulf between the Left and the Right, the liberal and the conservative, the pluralist and the religious fundamentalist, must have always been the determining feature of all societies.
 In any event, it is very much so in India today where, after decades of liberalism and secularism promoted by Jawaharlal Nehru, the Right-wing majoritarianism of the Hindu supremacist RSS is guiding the present ruling dispensation at the Centre.
 The two judicial pronouncements are nothing but the expressions of disquiet about the manner in which Rightist political views have become the norm in some of the television channels at the expense of media professionalism which stresses a strictly neutral approach to news and views.
 Hence, the so-called media trial of the accused in the tragic death which deliberately sensationalises the event so that the viewer's attention will be focussed on the tragedy and not on the problems faced by the Government such as the Coronavirus pandemic, the economic malaise and the tense Sino-Indian border situation.
 The Supreme Court's judgment, too, concerned a television serial which, the judges felt, were seeking to malign the Muslims. This vilification can be said to be in line with the Islamophobia which has marked the pro-Government channels, not to mention the BJP's formidable army of trolls who traduce not only the Muslims but also the Congress's Nehru-Gandhi dynasty, who have long been the BJP's bugbear.
 The antidote to such partisan coverage is the restoration of professionalism in journalism where the media personnel will eschew bias as was the practice earlier when a scribe's pride lay in being deemed fair. Although the governments of the day did try to woo them by providing housing and other facilities, such enticements rarely influenced what the correspondents wrote or said.
 As a result, some of the newspapers built up a reputation for being fiercely independent, a status for which some of their journalists faced jail terms during the Emergency. Today, only a handful of TV channels and publications can answer to the description of being independent. Elsewhere, professionalism is at a discount.
 It is this loss of journalistic integrity which has given rise to the calls for controlling the media. It is a...",

It has almost been six months that we all are under lockdown. This year was never planned but it happened, which makes it more obvious that there is some supernatural power that can put everything to halt. Every time everything doesn’t fall into place. We must trust nature. It can wreck havoc, it can solace, simultaneously. Nature can be the best and the worst thing to face. Confined to my house I keep wondering and thinking, will we ever be able to live a normal life; life that was loud, beautiful, bustling, and chaotic. But, it was life. There was drama, there were bustling streets, overcrowded buses, meeting friends, going to colleges and schools, unnecessary fights and much more we missed these months. While this lockdown is afflicting human lives but at the same time it cleansed the beautiful nature. Industries, factories, air and road traffic that contributed in pollution were brought to a standstill and the quality of air has improved drastically. Reduction in green house gases, less polluted water bodies and least human activity has healed nature. Isn’t that great? Nature has the quality to revive itself, it has proved so. We live in a country where we had to keep pollution in check by following odd and even rules, but the pandemic smashed such rules and forced us to follow what we could not have imagined. It made us realize how nature can play a role in providing inner peace and how little things can give us happiness.

TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — Just days after Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis won a court victory to keep felons from voting until they’ve paid off fines, restitution and court fees, billionaire Mike Bloomberg has stepped in to help them pay off the debts.The former Democratic presidential candidate has helped raise more than $20 million so that felons who completed their prison sentences can vote in the presidential election. Bloomberg also has pledged $100 million to help Joe Biden win Florida.“The right to vote is fundamental to our democracy and no American should be denied that right. Working together with the Florida Rights Restoration Coalition, we are determined to end disenfranchisement and the discrimination that has always driven it,” Bloomberg said in a written statement.A federal appellate court ruled on Sept. 11 that in addition to serving their sentences, Florida felons must pay all fines, restitution and legal fees before they can regain their right to vote. The case could have broad implications for the November elections. Florida has 29 electoral college votes that are crucial to President Donald Trump’s hopes of staying in the White House.Under Amendment 4, which Florida voters passed overwhelmingly in 2018, felons who have completed their sentences would have voting rights restored. Republican lawmakers then moved to define what it means to complete a sentence.In addition to prison time served, lawmakers directed that all legal financial obligations, including unpaid fines and restitution, would also have to be settled before a felon could be eligible to vote.The Florida Rights Restitution Coalition had raised about $5 million before Bloomberg made calls to raise almost $17 million more, according to Bloomberg staffers.The money is targeted for felons who registered to vote while the law was in question and who owe $1,500 or less. That accounts for about 31,100 people, the staffers said. In a state that decided the 2000 presidential election by 537 votes, that could be critical in a year when polls show Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden in a dead heat.Organizers for the group say they aren’t targeting people registered with a particular political party.“To hell with politics, to hell with any other implications or insinuations, at the end of the day it’s about real people, real lives, American citizens who want to be a part of this,” said Desmond Meade, the group’s executive director. “People with felony convictions have had their voices silenced for so long.”The group said other donors include John Legend, LeBron James, Michael Jordan, MTV, Comedy Central, VH1, Ben &amp; Jerry’s, Levi Strauss &amp; Co., the Miami Dolphins, the Orlando Magic, the Miami Heat and Stephen Spielberg.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.

Lucifer has been represented in so many different ways in pop culture that it's easy to think that the legend has dimmed a bit over the years considering that he's no longer the threat that he used to be back in the day. While the legend might still be very real for a lot of people and the threat of damnation for even speaking well of the devil might be a serious matter for those that think in this manner, a lot of others have taken to enjoying the story of Lucifer in many ways and as a result, the fear that his name once put into so many has lessened in a big way. No one wants to flirt with damnation, to be honest, but the idea of being afraid of something or someone we haven't seen in so long is enough to get a lot of people on board with what pop culture has done to the famed devil and has made him less of a fearsome creature than a wily and charismatic charmer that has been gracing our screens for a while now. A lot of shows and movies have made him into a character that's a little more sympathetic and a lot easier to look at since he's been portrayed as a man and a woman on a few occasions and almost every time there's been something about him that fans can't help but like.

Jabra acknowledges that it isn’t the first audio brand to launch active noise- cancelling wireless earbuds, but it does reckon its new Elite 85ts are the best. The new buds have a semi-open design, which Jabra says alleviates that feeling of blocked ears that some wearers complain of, but otherwise they’re just 1g heavier and slightly longer than the Elite 75t before them - despite the inclusion of a new dedicated ANC chip. Four of the six mics are on noise- cancelling duty, and you can manually adjust the sensitivity of the both the ANC and Jabra’s HearThrough feature, which pipes _in_ ambient sound. Noise- cancellation can be adjusted by tapping either bud, which are also tuned to block out wind racket. Larger 12mm drivers, Jabra says, provide big sound and powerful bass. You can expect 5.5 hours of listening on a full charge with ANC enabled, and a further 19.5 with the new charging case. The buds are rated IPX4 for water and sweat resistance and will be available to buy from late October for £220. Only just bought a pair of Jabra’s Elite 75t or Active 75t? The company says you’ll soon be able to try out a (presumably less effective) version of ANC through an over-the-air software update, aided by their Qualcom processor. Both models will continue to be sold and will have this functionality out of the box from now on.

Xi has failed to leverage ill feelings between many European leaders and Trump, while a potential detente with Japan has stalled.

 These troubles are, “by and large, problems of its own making,” Mazza said of China.
 As aggressive as Beijing can seem to its neighbors when using its expanding military and powerful economy to carve out what it sees as its natural sphere of influence in Asia, this is a fragile moment in what's often seen as China's inevitable rise as a superpower.
 Beijing has faced criticism over the continuing fallout from the coronavirus pandemic, which originated in Wuhan province late last year. Some say Beijing initially attempted to cover up the outbreak before seeking to take advantage of its response for public-relations ends.
 There's outrage over China's severe restriction of civil rights in Hong Kong following its imposition on the semi-autonomous city of a sweeping national security law, and over widespread accusations of mass detentions and cultural genocide against Muslims in the Xinjiang region. And there's wariness also over China's rising pressure and military threats against Taiwan, the self- governing island democracy that Beijing claims as its own territory.
 Meanwhile, China’s moves to claim nearly the entire South China Sea have led to friction with the United States and with Beijing’s neighbors to the south, while a decades-long border dispute with India erupted this year into deadly brawling between the rivals' troops and the firing of shots for the first time in decades.

I had a child of Class X ask me a question “Sir, why are we giving eight periods a week to history and geography? Why don’t you instead teach me Robotics, or let me play games, or learn music? History and geography are subjects I can learn on my i-Pad. You could give me the topics then ask me questions or examine me.” It seems a good idea and logical question to me. Why not? In the New Education Policy (NEP), there is to be a syllabus review, perhaps such comments need to be considered as a part of the exercise.

The only really important statistic, which you need to bear in mind is how many people are in hospital in a serious or critical condition with coronavirus, and the latest figure is 138. 138 people. We have more people killed in road accidents in a year than currently are being killed by the coronavirus. If we look at Sweden, where there's been no lockdown at all, no compulsory lockdown at any rate; social distancing and other measures have been practised, but individuals taking decisions for themselves on their own responsibility not in response to government orders... there are five people in the entire country in a serious and critical condition with coronavirus. So, these measures are just the desperate measures of an incompetent government that's trying to be seen to do something, anything, so that they can pretend they're in charge of a crisis, which they can't in practice control.

Elevator modernization is the process of upgrading the critical parts of the elevator in order to maintain the speed, efficiency, and safety of the elevator and the passengers traveling through it. Many of the elevators are built to provide around 20-30 years of service. As the age of the elevators increases and the equipment of the elevators are very difficult to find or replace, then the elevator is subjected to a total replacement. Modernization of the elevator includes the replacement of various components of the elevator such as cabin enclosures, signaling fixtures, door equipment, controllers, power units, and others. To ensure safety and convenience of the passengers traveling through the elevator, each of these components should be observed and replaced as it gets wear and tears to maintain a proper operating condition of the elevator.
