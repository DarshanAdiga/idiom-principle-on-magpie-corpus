 # Nigel Bradham feels 'extremely blessed' to be in Saints winning culture
 By Luke Johnson
 The Times-Picayune (New Orleans)
 Nigel Bradham sang a familiar tune when it came to answering why he chose to sign with the New Orleans Saints.
 The Saints have a winning culture in place, one that is recognizable even from the outside, and Bradham wanted to be a part of it.
 "When you come to a place where it's known for winning and known for being in the postseason, you see a different type of culture they have," Bradham said.
 He said that culture leads to natural higher expectations for the team from the players that make it up, and it leads to higher expectations from the organization for individual players.
 Several of the Saints additions this offseason have referenced some variation of this sentiment when pinpointing the reason they were drawn to an organization that has won more regular-season games than any other franchise the past three years and anticipates being in the running for a Super Bowl again in 2020. Bradham was simply the latest to fall in line when addressing local media for the first time as a Saint on Monday.
 In Bradham, the Saints signed a player with experience in winning locker rooms and plenty of game tape to evaluate.
 The veteran linebacker played the past four seasons with the Philadelphia Eagles, where his teams went 38-26 with two division titles, three playoff appearances and one Super Bowl win.
 He started each of the 58 games in which he appeared with the Eagles, amassing 348 tackles and 22 passes defended in his time there.
 Now he has to find where he fits within the Saints defensive framework. He agreed to terms with the Saints in late July, but his signing was not finalized on the NFL transaction wire until August 7, meaning he's had little time to get up to speed.
 "Right now we're just trying to feel where I fit best and me understanding the defense, learning the defense, learning the terminology, and just getting comfortable in the defense," Bradham said.
 Once he gets that down, he can see himself fitting into a larger role in a defense that excites him. The first thing he noticed about defensive coordinator Dennis Allen's defense was its multiplicity.
 "We were on a lot of different looks, a lot of different schemes and anytime (you do that) you pretty much have an advantage from week in and week out," Bradham said. "Being able to change up your defense and give offenses different looks."
 He's also looking forward to playing alongside some familiar faces.
 He called defensive back Patrick Robinson a teammate during their college years at Florida State -- Bradham is the sixth Seminole on the Saints roster -- and he spent the past four seasons with safety Malcolm Jenkins in Philadelphia. Bradham also got to know Demario Davis at the 2012 NFL combine and has continued that relationship throughout his career.
 "I was just fortunate to be able to know a lot of guys on this team, and had an opportunity to be able to just fit right in."
 The friendly faces, the defensive fit and the culture all lined up to New Orleans feeling like the right place for Bradham to land.
 "It's a great organization," Bradham said. "An organization that knows how to win and knows how to compete and puts themselves in position to be in great situations late in the year.
 "So anytime you get an opportunity to join a situation like that, you're extremely blessed."

Ricky Ponting has warned Ravichandran Ashwin and the rest of his Delhi Capitals squad he won't tolerate any "Mankad" run-outs during the Indian Premier League.
 The Australian great, who will again coach the team in next month's star- studded tournament, said the controversial tactic might be legal, but it was against the spirit of the game.
 All-rounder Ashwin sparked controversy and a worldwide debate last year with his "Mankading" of England batsman Jos Buttler when the spinner was captain of Kings XI Punjab.
 He has been hired by Delhi Capitals for next month's IPL in the United Arab Emirates, and Ponting said he will be talking to Ashwin as a priority.
 "I'll be having a chat to him about that, that'll be the first thing I do," he told the Grade Cricketer podcast on Wednesday.
 "It is going to be a hard conversation I'll have to have with him, but I'm pretty sure he'll take it on the chin.
 "He will say that it was within the rules and he had his rights to do it, but it's not within the spirit of the game or certainly the way I want the Delhi Capitals to play."
 The dismissal was named after India's Vinoo Mankad, who ran out Australia's Bill Brown by removing the bails at the bowler's end during the 1947 Sydney Test.
 The mode of dismissal, while legitimate, has been widely considered unsporting.
 But opposition to it has been softening recently, particularly in limited- overs cricket, when non-strikers can gain an unfair advantage by leaving the crease early.
 Ashwin employed the tactic last year, stopping in his delivery stride to whip off the bails while Rajasthan Royals' Buttler was backing up out of his ground.
 "If a bowler was to stop and the batsman was a foot out of his crease for instance, just penalise them some runs or something," Ponting said in suggesting an alternative.
 "If the umpires make a stance and do something to actually warn the batsman that they might be cheating, then I think that's better than having an ugly incident like a Mankad."

He knows the clock's ticking but Adam Scott still harbours the highest of ambitions as he steels himself for the most exciting stretch of the US golf season.
 Had it not been for three rescheduled majors either side of the FedExCup playoffs getting underway on Friday morning, Scott wouldn't have upped and left his growing family back home in Australia to return for the showpiece $US60 million finals.
 But the lure of an elusive second career major - and hopefully more - was too much for the former world No.1 to ignore.
 "I never really had Jack Nicklaus's major record pinned up on my boardroom wall or anything but I always felt like a real legend of the game was a five- time major champion," Scott said before the first round of the Northern Trust Open at Boston TPC.
 "I still feel that's relevant, and that's not to take anything away from players who have won multiple majors and had incredible careers.
 "But there can only be so many legends of the game. You have to draw the line somewhere and that's what I think about in my head and my goals and I feel like I want to win multiple majors.
 "Yeah, five still seems pretty clear to me. That's a pretty tough goal. I only have a few years to do it but I still think something like that would be fantastic."
 Scott knows the best lead-in to next month's US Open and then the Masters in November would be a run at Tour Championship glory.
 And where better to start than Boston, where he's had five top-10 finishes since landing his maiden US PGA Tour victory on the course back in 2003.
 "Fond memories to be here and I have good vibes," said the 2013 Masters champion.
 A philosophical Scott revealed one small regret when asked what advice he'd have given the 23-year-old version of himself after that Boston breakthrough.
 "I would have told myself to kind of come up with a strategy to block out exactly what Tiger (Woods) was doing in making us all feel slightly inferior to him," he said.
 "I liked a lot of the things (I) did at the time. Was on a good path, and I had some success soon after, as well. I won the Players' Championship about five months after I won here, so I was doing things well.
 "Then it gets a little tricky. I was kind of on that rise up as being a young pro, but then once you kind of get near the top 10 in the world, it's a real different level to maintain and push all the way up there and, looking back on it now, it's hard to remember exactly the influence and attention and intimidation that Tiger drew to golf tournaments.
 "But it was significant to every player that was out here."

OTTAWA - Foreign Affairs Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne says Canada condemns the junta that forced Mali's president from power this week.
 A distressed President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita announced his resignation on television after armed soldiers fired into the air outside his home and took him into custody Tuesday.
 Soldiers calling themselves the National Committee for the Salvation of the People promised that they would ultimately hand power to a transitional civilian government but gave no timeline.
 Condemnation of the coup was strong from many quarters, reflecting international concern about instability in Mali and West Africa amid increasing attacks by Islamic extremists and the ensuing economic fallout, which has been among the drivers of illegal migration to Europe.
 Champagne says Canada, which still has a handful of military officers and police working with the UN in Mali despite wrapping up a year-long helicopter mission last September, called on Malian security forces to follow the constitution and respect human rights.
 He also says any Canadians in Mali who need emergency assistance from consular officials should get in touch with the Canadian embassy in Bamako or call Global Affairs Canada's emergency hotline.

 # The waiting game: Nicholls football dealing with uncertainty after fall sports postponed
 By Kelly McElroy
 Sports Correspondent
 The Nicholls football team will have to wait at least a few more months to work toward what it hopes is a third-straight Southland Conference title and a fourth-straight trip to the Football Championship Subdivision playoffs after the SLC postponed all fall sports until the spring last week because of Covid-19.
 But as of right now, Nicholls coach Tim Rebowe said he is just as concerned about his players adjusting to a fall without football, the first for most of them since grade school or even before.
 “We want our players around here and we want to stay in touch with them without overkill,” Rebowe said. “We want them to know we are here for them, even just to talk. We are encouraging them to be around the coaches and the athletic complex to give them that comfort feeling. We are here and we have people who can talk to them. Some guys don’t know what to do without football this time of year because of the routine that goes along with it. Now they have a lot of time on their hands and they have to learn how to handle that.”
 The Colonels were 9-5 overall and 7-2 in the SLC last season and fell in the second round of the playoffs to eventual national champion North Dakota State 37-13 and Rebowe said many players were disappointed when he broke the news to them that there would be no SLC football this fall.
 Nicholls was just a couple days into fall practice when news came down from the conference about fall sports being postponed.
 “There were a lot of things out there on social media, so I think a lot of them kind of saw it coming, so it wasn’t a total shock, but I still think there was some disbelief that it really happened,” Rebowe said. “The mood was kind of somber when we told them on Wednesday night when we found out. We wanted them to hear it from us.”
 Rebowe said the team is off this week while details are being worked out by the SLC as to how football teams in the conference will move forward.
 “There are a lot of unknowns,” Rebowe said. “We are still learning and changing every day. You have to look at eligibility. Are we going to play games? How many games are we going to play? We are not lifting or meeting this week. There is still some legislation coming from the NCAA as to what part of the year we are in. Are we in summer access where we get 20 hours a week or are do we go back to the offseason where we get eight hours a week? Some teams are still petitioning to play. We are going to get back in the weight room next week. We won’t get into anything else until we know where we are going. We just want to see what the next step will be.”

Landis described North Star as a first-year team and this season is “year one.” His players seem to be on board with his mentality.
 “Right now, our roster is at 40,” Landis said. “I handed out 40 helmets this year. Our summer numbers were good, we had a lot of guys there. We’re really starting to get going. It’s nice watching guys develop and learn positions, all while adapting to a new scheme.
 “So far, the transition has been good. I wish we could’ve gotten together a little more in the spring, and this is presenting us with a unique challenge. But, the players are picking everything up well, and it’s really reinforcing what we’re trying to do here.”
 One first-year player that has already made an impact on Landis is senior wide receiver Drew Lane. A member of the Cougars basketball team, Lane had a strong summer during workouts and performed well at 7-on-7 according to Landis.
