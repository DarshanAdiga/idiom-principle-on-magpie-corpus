 _25 жовтня 2020 року – знаковий ювілей в історії світового фінансового ринку. Цього дня у 1920-му США дізналися про банкрутство The Securities Exchange Company – фірми, «творчий доробок» якої увійшов до підручників з економіки та фінансів як «Схема Понці», класичний приклад фінансової піраміди._       _Компанія існувала лише рік, але її вплив на розвиток фінансових ринків, перш за все, у США, а потім – у всьому світі, важко переоцінити. За іронією долі, гучне банкрутство The Securities Exchange Company (або ж скорочено SEC), стало поштовхом для створення іншої SEC – Securities and Exchange Commission, державної комісії з цінних паперів та бірж у США, яка з’явилася 1934 року._       _Символічно, але сто років потому після справи Понці, SEC довела до кінця іншу знакову історію – один з найбільших американських інвестбанків JP Morgan Chase був_ _ _оштрафований на мільярд доларів__ _за так званий «спуфінг» – маніпуляції на ринках облігацій та ф’ючерсів на метали з метою штучного створення вигідних банку трендів._       _Що об’єднує статусних інвестбанкірів сьогодення та легендарного італо- американського афериста Чарльза Понці? Відповідь приховано у слові «етика». Її не було ані у діях Понці, ані у тактиці брокерів JP Morgan Chase. Обидва випадки – приклад того, як фінансисти у погоні за прибутком забувають про моральну складову свого бізнесу._       _Дарма. Але чому це настільки важливо? Та чи притаманна етика фінансовому ринкові України?_    _﻿_    _LIGA.net розбиралася у цьому складному питанні у спільному проєкті з Асоціацією інвестиційних професіоналів CFA Society Ukraine._    __

No. 3 Georgia at No. 2 Alabama. The mid-week news that Alabama coach Nick Saban tested positive for COVID-19 added a challenging backdrop for the season's first Top 5 matchup. Saban figures to be communicating his marching orders and input from home while offensive coordinator Steve Sarkisian likely serves in his stead on the sidelines. The Crimson Tide sends quarterback Mac Jones and the nation's top scoring offense against linebacker Monty Rice and the No. 2 scoring defense. Georgia coach Kirby Smart attempts to become the first ex-Saban assistant to beat their old boss. Alabama running back Najee Harris has run for 10 touchdowns in three games while the Bulldogs haven't allowed a TD on the ground. Alabama receivers like Jaylen Waddle, John Metchie III and DeVonta Smith face their biggest test by far.

     I confess I went in with these preconceptions, added to by the fact that Julian Fellows, who is about as far removed as you can get from American rock, wrote the book. I was expecting something that would be, at best, lukewarm.      After seeing the show, I am a convert. All my apprehension evaporated in the first moments of the show. The lyrics and dialogue are witty, the music is catchy and everything you want from a rock musical and the cast are phenomenal.       The story is a typical cliche underdog tale and you know how its going to end but all along you find yourself rooting for the lead character and enjoying being swept along a journey filled with fun and joy - the joy of music.       And isn't that part of what a musical is about? The celebration of live music. The emotive power it has on an audience and its ability to engage and say more than words ever can.      The creative team have done a great job and Lloyd Webber has proved that he can still create a hit after a few shaky years involving 'Love Never Dies' and 'Stephen Ward'.       Special mention has to go to the company of kids that sing, dance and play characters, not just children, but they also play their own instruments live on stage. These kids have a bright future ahead and, if nothing else, kudos to Lloyd Webber for encouraging and nurturing this kind of talent. Bravo!
