"I am excited to have Chris on board as the new wrestling coach," BNL athletic director Jeff Callahan said. "He brings a wealth of knowledge as a former high school and college wrestler and also years of head coaching experience."
 BNL also found the new face of its boys and girls swimming and diving programs as Adam Young's hiring was approved at Thursday night's meeting as well.
 Young will be replacing Terry Tlustek, who served as either the head coach or an assistant for BNL swimming and diving for 10 years. Tlustek stepped down after making the decision to move with his family to Idaho.
 Young will be taking over a highly-successful swimming program that sent multiple athletes the state finals this past season under Tlustek's guidance.
 "Adam has a long history in swimming," Callahan said. "He has worked with the BNL program over the years as assistant coach and has been the Lawrence County Aquatics coach for several years. I am excited to work with Adam as he continues to build in the strong foundation of BNL swimming and diving."

The tallest grass on earth at its smallest could be among the cheapest immunity boosters for increasing the human body’s resistance to viral attacks, experts have said.
 The bamboo, considered the grass of life in the northeast, takes care of almost every requirement from birth to death. But the focus of more than 25 experts from 11 countries who converged digitally to mark ‘World Bamboo Day’ on Friday was on the nutraceutical bamboo shoot.
 The term ‘nutraceutical’ is used to describe medicinally or nutritionally functional foods while bamboo shoots are the edible sprouts of the perennial grass.
 “Bamboo shoots are emerging as high-value and safe edibles and growing in utility globally along with all other value-added bamboo products. The protein content in fresh bamboo shoots, considered as nutraceutical, can range between 1.49-4.04%. They also contain 17 amino acids, eight of which are essential for the human body,” said Syam Vishwanath, director of the Kerala Forest Research Institute.
 ## Global market
 The present global market of bamboo shoots is around $1,700 million. More than 3 million tonnes of bamboo shoots are consumed across the earth annually, but the shoot production and consumption in India are confined mostly to the north-eastern States.
 “Value-addition which enhances storage and diversification in new-age food products like vegetable protein concentrates can enhance its market potential and consumer acceptability further,” Mr. Vishwanath said.
 Kamesh Salam, executive director of South Asia Bamboo Foundation, said India had a long way to go before bamboo shoots were appreciated as a superfood. “Countries such as Philippines have worked wonders with bamboo and bamboo shoots vis-a-vis COVID-19,” he told _The Hindu_ after a ‘festival’ to mark ‘World Bamboo Day’ that he had proposed in 2009 during his stint as the president of the World Bamboo Organisation.
 Bamboo has been a key ingredient in new antimicrobial soaps and hand mists developed by Filipino scientists to fight the novel coronavirus.
 According to the National Bamboo Mission, India has the highest area (13.96 million hectares) under bamboo and is the second richest country after China in terms of bamboo diversity with 136 species. The annual production of bamboo in India is 14.6 million tonnes and the bamboo-rattan industry in the country was worth ₹28,005 crore in 2017.
 Data with the International Network for Bamboo and Rattan (INBAR) say China exports 68% of the world’s bamboo and rattan products valued at $1,112.

Speaking after completing the transfer, Buam said, "Well, it's an absolute honour for me to join FC Goa. I'm happy and excited. There is real joy in my heart and I am really looking forward to my future as a Gaur."   "To be honest, over the past few years, I have become a fan of FC Goa. The style and the mentality to always attack is something that drew me. I watched nearly all the FC Goa games last season and even when I couldn't, I would watch the whole replay," he added.   Hailing from Jaintia Hills in Meghalaya, Buam started his career with Royal Wahingdoh where he appeared for their U16 and U18 sides. He then moved to Shillong Lajong, where he helped the side win the U18 Youth League (the current Youth League) in 2018.   The same year, he would go on to impress all and sundry with his performances in the I-League. And even though Shillong had to go through a relegation, the youngster's performances caught the eye as someone who has the ability to play across the front line.   Last season saw Buam help Shillong Lajong win both the Shillong Premier League and Meghalaya State League where he top-scored for his side, combining goals from both tournaments. Later during the season, he had moved out on loan to Bengaluru United to play in the 2nd Division League and gain more exposure. (ANI)

This is how the story unfolded in Berlin, and owners of the Z Flip also have to be prepared for more obvious gawking and staring each time they open and close this tiny technological miracle in public. In the midst of this pandemic, the foldable smartphone ensures that fellow human beings are able to drop their guard, make a minor adjustment to their face mask, and simply ask questions. That is so un-German, so it does take some getting used to. Most people who are interested in the Galaxy Z Flip happen to be elderly, although to be fair, I have seen many young women and big city hipsters in particular, who simply wanted to know more about the smartphone and approached me with quiet confidence.
 I can't blame them. This smartphone is also a fashion accessory. And if we weren't living at a time when everyone is extra cautious about touching things because they do not want to get their fingers dirty, most people on the bus and train would have loved to take it away from me for a moment. To simply hold it in their own hands, to open it once and close it over and over again. Those were beautiful moments. Technology connects people together; and this is a prime example of how a smartphone may just get rid of your loneliness after all.
 ## At some point, I freaked out
 But throughout my 100 days spent with the Galaxy Z Flip, it was not all plain sailing as I did not experience beautiful moments at all times. While the smartphone is a great fashion accessory that everyone wants to talk about, the Z Flip does not do much when closed. The Z Flip is shy, sometimes you want to shake it: "Why won't you talk to me?" The small pill-shaped display shows off notifications and appointments or calls in real-time. Nevertheless, every single day, I suffered from a panicky feeling of missing out on something important. To be notified of any developments is especially important in my profession, so the tiny display does not do much for me. As a private person, I would also like to have some peace and quiet.

New Delhi [India], September 18 (ANI): DMK MP Dayanidhi Maran on Friday alleged that Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is "diluting Goods and Services Tax (GST) compensation issue with 'Act of God' excuse" and that no green shoots were visible in the economy.   Taking part in the debate in Lok Sabha on the Supplementary Demands for Grants (First Batch) for 2020-21, he said the government should bring a white paper on the "economic crisis".  
 "Finance Minister is diluting GST compensation issue with 'Act of God' excuse. How can Centre expect states to carry on the additional burden of borrowing? This is nothing short of deception. We don't see any green shoots in the economy," Maran said.   "I urge the government and especially Finance Minister to release a white paper on the existing economic crisis and adopt a consultative approach with the opposition parties, state governments and industry representatives to boost confidence in the economy," he added.   MPs of several opposition parties had on Thursday protested in front of the Mahatma Gandhi statue in Parliament premises, demanding pending GST compensation to states. (ANI)

We're all staying inside watching more TV, and with sports such as NFL football and NBA basketball in full swing again, it could be a good time to consider a live TV streaming service. A subscription lets you cut the cable TV cord to save money while keeping your family's access to live TV channels (e.g. CNN, ESPN and TNT) as well as your local stations including ABC, CBS, Fox and NBC. Instead of a cable box you'll watch via media streamers like Roku, Amazon Fire TV or Apple TV, your game console or your smart TV itself.
 At CNET we've tested all seven of the major live TV-streaming services and our two favorites for premium users -- cord cutters who don't mind paying a bit more for a full package of channels and features -- are YouTube TV and Hulu Plus Live TV. Both offer large selections of live channels, a cloud DVR that lets you record shows to watch later and extras like user profiles and multiple simultaneous streams.

My 15-year-old son, Jon, has turned into quite the craftsman. It seems that between YouTube videos and my tools he can make nearly anything. During the Covid-19 lockdown over the summer, he took his crafting to a new level and started making rings out of various materials. Years ago, I showed him a signet ring that my own dad gave me. The ring was made out of a stainless steel nut that dated back to his time working at a shipyard during World War II.
 Well, Jon got tired of making rings out of wood and soft metals, and decided to make his own steel ring. He took apart an old set of bearings and with a grinder turned part of it into a pretty nice thick band. As he worked to get the sharp. The ring was a bit tight, so he was using a round file to adjust the size. One of those times, he put it on with a somewhat still sharp corner pointing away from his palm. When he started taking it off, it was cutting into his finger just enough to bleed a little.
 He couldn’t get the steel ring off, and his finger started swelling. It started turning dark colors that weren’t natural for a finger. He turned first to his mom, who tried all the usual tricks for getting a stuck ring off. She tried the soap trick, the string trick, and so forth. That’s when I was called in.
 Being the typical man, I set out to up the game. Jon and I went out to my workbench, and I got out my Dremmel tool, put on a cutting disk, and was going to simply cut the thing off. Keep in mind that Jon was in a lot of pain, and his finger still bled a little. Thanks to my brilliant idea, he soon had a new pain. Those grinding wheels generate a lot of heat when you try to cut through hardened steel.
 The ring had to come off, so we tried to cool things with water while I worked on cutting the ring without cutting my son. That didn’t work any better, and I only scratched the ring. Jon was amazingly tough, but was really ready for the pain to stop, and my wife was getting really worried that he might lose his finger. This all went on for an hour or so.
 It was time for professional help. My wife suggested that we go to the fire department. The closest Urgent Care to us was in Colonial Heights, that’s where we went. They quickly got us back to see the the Physicians Assistant that was working that afternoon. He got out an ingenious device that is aptly know as a ring cutter. This device is apparently great at cutting off gold rings, but it was no match for the hardened steel of Jon’s ring. The Doctor on duty had no better solution, and was going to send us to the emergency room to see if they had a way to cut the ring off. Jon’s finger was getting a lot worse, and they feared that if we didn’t get the ring off pretty soon, there could be permanent damage, or even possible loss of the finger. My wife renewed her opinion that the fire department might have something that would work, and there is a fire sub-station right next door.
 The Physician’s Assistant walked with us to the Fire Department, and explained the urgency of our situation to the Fire Department Captain that came to the door. Because of Covid, they couldn’t let us into the station, but in short order we had about six people outside with us, including firemen and medical folks. They all seemed impressed that Jon was being so calm when he was obviously hurting quite a lot.
 It seems that they had the same kind of ring cutter, and theirs didn’t work either. Next came the regular toolbox. They managed to make a cardboard skin shield and get it between Jon’s finger and the ring. Then, they held the ring still with a pair of strong pliers. The Captain took a hack saw and must have made a zillion very short strokes with it over the next couple of hours.
 Our Physicians Assistant had to go back to work, but came back on his own time to see how Jon was doing. Several of the Fire Station personnel had shifts that ended, but they stayed with us. The staff that came in joined the effort, holding Jon’s hand still, and holding the ring still, while the Captain made careful strokes of only a few saw teeth at a time. This kept the heat down, and it made slow but steady progress. Another firefighter took over the sawing for a short time, but then the Captain took back over. They did a great job of reassuring Jon that they had this under control and to just keep being strong. Mom, meanwhile, was watching from a few feet away and was really worried, because it was taking so long.
 Finally, after darkness fell, and flashlights came out, the ring was cut through. The decision was made to use two sets of locking pliers to hold the ring still. A flathead screwdriver was placed in the slot, and a wrench was placed on the handle to turn it. Faces of the firefighters turned red as they somehow held everything still so the screwdriver wouldn’t stab into Jon’s swollen finger. The struggle was mighty, and the ring won. By now, Jon’s finger was swelling into the cut of the ring.
 The firefighters and medics did not give up. They turned Jon’s hand over, somehow reinserted the homemade skin shield and started the agonizingly slow sawing process on the backside of the ring. Jon held strong, and my stomach felt queasy. Mom couldn’t watch. Short stroke after short stroke started to make the second cut in the ring. When the cut was about halfway through, they turned Jon’s hand back over, and all resumed their bracing positions. This time the ring opened just enough to come off of Jon’s finger.
 The cut from the ring was bandaged, and the Physicians Assistant did several tests to make sure that blood was indeed flowing and that sensation was returning to the finger tip. When it was all over, Jon’s new friends at the Fire Department were relieved that their solution worked, and celebrated with Jon.
 I realize that during this rescue none of those folks had their lives on the line, but they were my heroes when I needed them. These first responders saved my son’s finger, and we weren’t charged a dime. They were happy to help, and I’ll always be grateful.
 Our Heroes are not the celebrities and athletes that try to tell us how to live, think and vote. The real heroes are all around us. They are the folks that are there to help when we have troubles. They deserve our unfailing support.

At a time when students are supposed to keep their hands to themselves, friends Hunter Shelton, left, and Charolette Rheault felt the need to hold hands as they comforted each other while meeting their transitional kindergartner teacher Stacy Schmitz. The pair were new to Weaver Elementary School in the Los Alamitos Unified School District. The school opened with a waiver along with five other campuses in the district, making them the first public elementary schools to reopen in Orange County. This hit especially close to home for me because my youngest child, Emily, was in fifth grade at this school when it closed in March. She’s moved on to middle school now, but our family’s abrupt departure from campus last spring prevented us from saying goodbye. It was nice to be able to go back to the school, even if it was only for an hour. — _Jeff Gritchen_

Taken together, though, the legacy of the pilgrims and the puritans is foundational. The work ethic. The fact Americans don't take much annual holiday. Notions of self-reliance and attitudes towards government welfare. Laws that prohibit young adults from drinking in bars until the age of 21. A certain prudishness. The religiosity. Americans continue to expect their presidents to be men of faith. In fact, no occupant of the White House has openly identified as an atheist. Also the profit motive was strong among the settlers, and with it the belief that prosperity was a divine reward for following God's path - a forerunner of the gospel of prosperity preached by modern-day television evangelists.
   * The preachers getting rich from poor Americans
 All these national traits have traceable roots to the Puritans. The Frenchman Alexis de Tocqueville even wrote in his seminal work, Democracy in America: "I think we can see the whole destiny of America contained in the first Puritan who landed on these shores."
 The Pilgrim Fathers - or more accurately, the Pilgrim Mothers - also created a gene pool from which tens of millions of Americans continue to draw. So many US citizens claim to have descendants who arrived on the Mayflower that you'd be forgiven for thinking this three-sailed vessel was the size of an aircraft carrier.
 For all that, just about the only time the Pilgrim Fathers loom large in the national imagination is on Thanksgiving, that pre-Christmas feast of turkey and pumpkin pie when the whole of America comes to a calorific halt. This national holiday derives from the celebration marking the first harvest in 1621, when the colonists sat down with the Wampanaog Native Americans. It's been packaged up as an act of peaceful co-existence, a convivial banquet which suggests that the Pilgrim Fathers were welcomed by indigenous Americans with open arms.
 Yet most of what American schoolchildren are taught about that holiday does not withstand close scrutiny. It's a mythology not a history. There are the inconsequential inaccuracies. It's thought, for example, that venison was the main meat on offer. The modern-day menu of turkey and pumpkin pie was invented by a 19th Century magazine publisher, the Martha Stewart of her day, who had read about that first feast and lobbied Abraham Lincoln to turn Thanksgiving into a national holiday.

Studies of past elections have shown voter fraud to be exceedingly rare. In the five states that regularly send ballots to all voters, there have been no major cases of fraud or difficulty counting the votes.
 The poll found that 33% of Democrats, but just 12% of Republicans, favor mail- only elections. That’s a decline across the board from April, when 47% of Democrats and 29% of Republicans backed the idea. Seventy-two percent of Democrats, but just 25% of Republicans, favor no-excuse absentee voting.
 In swing states like Florida, North Carolina and Pennsylvania, Democrats have far outpaced Republicans in requesting mail-in ballots so far this year.
 John Mohr, 58, who works at a Dollar General store in Wilmington, North Carolina, asked for a mail-in ballot, but he plans to drop it off at his local elections office. He’s seen videos on Facebook saying — falsely — that mail-in ballots are labeled by party, tipping off postal workers who could throw them out before they reach the elections office.

OTTAWA - The federal minister overseeing key aid programs for workers during the pandemic says there could still be changes to a proposed package of income-support benefits as the country faces renewed pressure from COVID-19.
 That includes caregiver payments for anyone who can't go to work because their child's school or daycare is closed, or they have to keep them home for COVID-19 reasons.
 To get the help after the fact, workers would have to show they could not work at least 60 per cent of their usual hours, or about three days out of a five- day workweek.
 Employment Minister Carla Qualtrough says she's heard that eligibility criteria might be too restrictive for parents who have to take off a day or two to wait in hours-long lines for a COVID-19 test.
 She says the proposed package and eligibility rules are a baseline and that the government wants them to be flexible to take into consideration that some people may only need one or two days.
 The alternative would be to start from scratch on benefits, which Qualtrough says the Liberals want to avoid.
 This report by The Canadian Press was first published Sept. 18, 2020.

Eugenio Fascetti ha parlato a TMW anche di Fiorentina-Torino, la gara inaugurale della Serie A. "Leggevo subito per il Torino quest'estate dopo la prima amichevole: 'Si vede già la mano di Giampaolo'. Aspettiamo un attimo, anche per rispetto verso chi c'è stato prima. Sul mercato mi aspettavo di più, per un salto di qualità. Il Toro non può stare nella colonna di destra della classifica. La Fiorentina ha tenuto per ora tutti e ha inserito alcuni buoni giocatori, può fare un campionato interessante e dire la sua nella lotta all'Europa. Il centravanti? Mi auguro che sia l'anno di Vlahovic, potenzialmente c'è. Kouame al Genoa mi ha fatto una bella impressione. La Fiorentina non può non lottare per l'Europa, la città merita una platea europee e non può vivacchiare. Gli allenatori di quest'anno? Voglio vedere se De Zerbi avrà migliorato la fase difensiva. Se sarà così può aspirare a grandi platee. Ma voglio vedere anche Italiano che ha fatto un'impresa non indifferente".

As a person who relies on a wheelchair, Danielle Anderson is all too aware of the extra challenges she faces should a Southern California Edison public safety power shutoff (PSPS) occur. During last week’s heat wave, the public utility warned customers, including thousands of Malibuites, that power could be cut should expected high winds appear. Luckily, they did not.
 Anderson, of the Independent Living Resource Center in Ventura, which advocates for those with disabilities, and California State Senator Henry Stern participated in a virtual town hall Thursday evening to give guidance on how to prepare for a PSPS because the elderly and disabled are disproportionally affected by disasters.
 Also known as intentional or planned blackouts, the controversial PSPS program, approved by the California Public Utilities Commission, allows electricity suppliers such as SCE to pull the plug on this precious resource in a high fire danger period such as a red flag warning. However, that is just the time residents may need it most—to receive electronic alerts warning of imminent fire danger. This is especially troubling for some of the most vulnerable—elderly and disabled populations.

Kris Kelly's team is facing disaster as the _Bering Sea Gold_ star continues on his hunt for gold despite freezing temperatures and equipment being pushed to its brink. In a tension-filled PopCulture exclusive sneak peek of Friday's all-new episode of the Discovery show, Chris "Turtle" Thornton mans the air and hot water being pumped down to the team's diver, but things quickly go wrong when the overwhelming cold begins to wreak havoc on the endeavor.
 Kelly notes that things have been "pretty crazy" with the temperatures dropping to dangerous levels, but pushes on with caution. "It's so cold out the dive hole is already beginning to freeze over," he tells the camera. "And none of these machines are built for this kind of temperature. It's a s-- show." When the diver gets down to 14 ft., he radios up to the control room that things are "starting to get cold," questioning if the hot water being pumped down to keep him from getting hypothermia is malfunctioning. While Thornton assures everyone the equipment is still working, the diver begins to panic as his mask freezes and his air begins to run out, with the clip ending just as everyone rushes to pull him up before disaster hits.
 At the start of this season of _Bering Sea Gold_ , Captain Emily Reidel told PopCulture that "brutal" weather had made this winter unlike any she had seen before. "The longer you're here, the longer you realize how important every decision is," she explained of the pressure on her as a captain. "I think things at times were tense, because ultimately everyone was there to make money. ...When all your hard work isn't manifested into gold, it can start to break you down mentally."
 As for te weather, Reidel warned of just how things can change on a dime, putting the whole crew at risk in a second. "I've never seen anything like it," she said of her experience at sea. "The Bering Sea is kind of unique in that, when weather happens, it escalates really quickly. ...It's always these really difficult decisions [as a captain]. When you're right, you're right. But when you're wrong, you lose a lot of money." _Bering Sea Gold_ airs Fridays at 8 p.m. ET on Discovery. For more from PopCulture on all the Discovery Channel's latest shows, click here.

Frank Herbert's _Dune_ is one of the great works of science fiction literature, and so it's understandable that there would be interest in bringing such a story to life on the big screen. However, doing so has proved difficult.

Jodorowsky has now apparently seen the trailer for the upcoming Denis Villeneuve directed version, and he has opinions. Although, it should be said most of his opinions have to less to do with his thoughts on _Dune_ itself versus what the movie represents.

People who don't already have the apps would be unable to download them, while current owners won't have access to new or updated versions. Those who've already downloaded either app should be able to continue using them, at least for the time being.
 Other actions would be prohibited starting Sept. 20 for WeChat and Nov. 12 for TikTok. Internet hosting companies, content delivery networks, and internet transit or peering services in the US would be banned from enabling the functionality or optimization of the apps. Further, any software or services within the US would be prevented from using the code or features of the two apps. These actions would effectively kill the use of the apps in the US.
 In an announcement released on Friday, Department of Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said that the Chinese Communist Party has shown the means and motivations to use these apps to threaten the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the US. Ross charged WeChat and TikTok with collecting vast amounts of data from users, including network activity, location data, and browsing and search histories.
 "At the President's direction, we have taken significant action to combat China's malicious collection of American citizens' personal data, while promoting our national values, democratic rules-based norms, and aggressive enforcement of U.S. laws and regulations," Ross said in a statement.
 Ross added that the threats posed by WeChat and TikTok aren't identical but are similar. Each app is an "active participant in China's civil-military fusion," subject to the "mandatory cooperation" of the Chinese Communist Party. As such, both apps present "unacceptable risks to our national security," charged Ross.
 Owned by ByteDance, TikTok is a social media app used by people to create, find, and share short videos. You can watch videos from a wide array of creators and design your own videos with special effects, filters, and music. Tencent's WeChat is a messaging and calling app though which people can stay in touch with friends, play games together, and send or receive mobile payments via the WeChat Pay feature.
 Given the Nov. 12 deadline for additional actions, TikTok still has some wiggle room. The extended deadline is in place because the Trump administration has been calling on parent company ByteDance to sell TikTok to a US company.
 Following interest by Microsoft and Walmart, Oracle has emerged as a potential buyer to either purchase TikTok in total or carve out a majority stake in it. Whatever the outcome, the administration would have to be assured that TikTok no longer poses a national security threat for the app to pass muster. The president said that he's not ready to sign off on any deal between Oracle and TikTok unless that happens, even expressing unhappiness were Oracle to simply buy a stake in the app.
 Following Trump's executive order in August, TikTok sued the administration. ByteDance has insisted that it keeps all user data in the US with only a backup in Singapore and that it would not share data with the Chinese government if requested. In a phone call with the administration, several US companies cited the executive order as being too vague.
 In a press briefing on Friday, senior officials from the Department of Commerce declined to offer specific examples of TikTok or WeChat being used to spy on Americans or incidents where they shared data on US users with the Chinese government. Instead, the officials pointed to TikTok's Chinese counterparts Douyin and WeChat as tools for government surveillance, saying that the same thing could happen in the US.
 "Whether we have any evidence, domestically, of these particular apps taking data is missing the point," a senior Commerce official said. "We know what they're using these apps for overseas, we know what the Chinese government's intent is here in the United States."

Journalists from different parts of the world draw the conclusion that they can immensely contribute to the peaceful unification of Korea and the Denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula.
 Expressing their views on three days online World Journalist Conference 2020 concluded in Seoul South Korea, they said that journalists can play an important role to create global opinion in favor of peaceful unification.
 The World Journalists Conference 2020, an annual media event, organized by the Journalists Association of Korea (JAK).
 Addressing the session on the 70th Anniversary of the Korean War and Peace Policy in the Korean Peninsula, media persons argued that there need to create an environment to put pressure on the North Korean regime to stop nuclear arms stockpiling and deteriorating.
 Md. Tawfiguqe Ali, a journalist from Indonesia, said that the global community needs to unite to put further pressure on North Korea so that they are compelled to join a peaceful unification process. He said that journalists can play an important role to build a global opinion.
 Santiago Castillo Roderiguez said expressed that there needs to put more pressure no not only on the North Korean regime but also on China as well. Peaceful Unification of Korea and peace and stability in the Korean Peninsula is in the interest of north-east Asia and the global community.
 Neha Banka journalist from India said that there involve so many international players in the Korean Peninsula. She stressed the need for the implementation of UN-sanctioned and also presses China to play a role to pursue North Korea for peace.
 Keshab Poudel, the journalist from Nepal, also expressed the view that the peaceful unification of Korea and peace and stability in Korean Peninsula is in the broader interest of the global community including Nepal.
 Renowned Korean Scholar Eul-chul Lim elaborates in-depth the current status of the Korean Peninsula and the aggressive acts of the North Korean regime to derail the peace process.
 Organized by Korean Journalist Association, more than 80 journalists from different parts of the world and over 100 participants from South Korea attended ht meeting.
 Another Korean scholar Son Taek Wang also explained the Korean Peninsula’s current situation and efforts of the present South Korean government to the peaceful unification of Korea and denuclearization in Korean Peninsula.
 Held in International Convention Hall, Korea Press Center, Seoul, and a three- day conference held on 14 to 16 September discussed on three most important contemporary issues. The first-day session begins with the congratulatory remarks of the prime minister of the Republic of Korea Chung Sye-Kyun.
 Kim Dong Hoon, President, Journalists Association of Korea welcomed the participants for joining the conference despite the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic affecting all over the world.
 Three journalists from Nepal also took part in the conference presented their papers. Senior Journalist Gokarna Awasthi presented the paper on the first-day session on fake news and Kuber Chalise, Editor of Karobar Daily, presented his paper on Global Response to COVID-19 and Disease control method.
 The conference discussed in-depth examples of fake news in different countries and what measures they took to counter this global problem, as well as the future of journalism. In the session, they discussed how we can improve the validity and reliability of the media.
 The second issue covered global responses to COVID-19 and disease control methods. It identified the roles that the media assumed in putting an end to the pandemic across the world by highlighting Korea’s effective disease control system and by examining other cases.
 The third issue was devoted to discussing the 70th anniversary of the Korean War and peace policy in the Korean Peninsula.
 Participated by the Journalists from Asia, Africa, Europe Latin America and North America, the conference held lively discussions on the contemporary global issue. As it was hosted during the time of the 70th Anniversary of the Korean War, the last day session was highly significant to understand the Korean War and the current state of the peaceful unification process.
 “In light of the COVID-19 outbreak early this year, the Journalists Association of Korea (JAK) has postponed the World Journalists Conference, which normally takes place in spring with journalists from all around the world in attendance, to autumn,” JAK president Kim Dong Hoon has said.
 “However, as the virus continues to spread worldwide, the event will be held online. The World Journalists Conference is an annual event that invites overseas journalists to Korea to discuss the role of the media in contributing to the development of journalism and maintaining peace both in Korea and the world.”
 The event also provides a networking platform for journalists while introducing them to Korean natural heritages as well as to the lifestyles of Koreans, the peacekeepers, he added.
 Each session featured local and international speakers who delivered speeches related to the theme. A question and answer session was also conducted for all speakers to answer queries, highlight points and ensure successful communication.
 “This event was a meaningful opportunity to share knowledge and network with other journalists from all around.” The JAK President said.
 “The three-day gathering, although short in time, does offer a valuable opportunity to contribute to the development of journalism, acquire a better understanding of Korea, and reinforce networks with other journalists,” he said.
 Since its launch in 2013, this year’s event is the eighth World Journalists Conference. The Journalists Association of Korea, established in 1964, has more than 10,000 members from hundreds of media companies.
 In 2019, more than 70 journalists from 50 countries took part in the week-long conference.
 The Journalists Association of Korea has celebrated its 56th anniversary with a pledge to build further on the achievements accomplished over more than five decades by its founders and members.
 In commemoration of the 70th anniversary of the Korean War, a panel discussion was held with various experts to discuss the ways to improve relations between North Korea and South Korea and eventually achieve peace not only in Korea but also in the world.

 Senior party leader Prem Singh Chandumajra told _The Hindu_ , that at the core committee meeting, party members analysed the entire situation in the backdrop of the Ms. Badal resignation.
 “All members expressed satisfaction over the decision of Ms. Badal to resign from the government against the farm legislations. We also decided to expose the double speak of the Congress party among the people on the issue,” he said.
 Also read: ‘Saddened’ my voice in support of farmers was not heard, says Harsimrat Kaur Badal
 Mr. Chandumajra said the ruling Congress government was directly responsible for amending the State APMC Act (Agriculture Produce Marketing Act) in 2017 immediately after coming to power in the State, to include all the provisions of the Farming Produce Trade and Commerce Ordinance 2020.
 “Not only, this the Congress government is also party to the passing of the Farming Produce Ordinance as it participated in the consultative process to enable implementation of the Bills. Congress stands completely exposed and we will now tell people about Congress’s double speak,” said Mr. Chandumajra.
 ## Deflecting threat
 Responding to speculations surrounding the SAD’s departure from the NDA, Mr. Chandumajra said the Assembly election in Punjab, which is due in 2022, are far away. “Our first priority is to sort out the challenges that have currently come to the fore,”
 The focus on the Congress aligned with what senior SAD MP Naresh Gujral told _The Hindu_ , that his party was “mindful of the eyeball-to-eyeball confrontation” that the Indian Army was engaged in with the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) in Easter Ladakh and other parts of the border and the fact that Pakistan had been trying to foment trouble in Punjab. “We don’t want unity to suffer at this time,” he said.
 Prime Minister Modi, Home Minister Amit Shah and BJP president J.P. Nadda, however, kept up the rhetoric on how the three farm bills to which the SAD objected were important reforms in the agricultural sector.
 During a video conference to inaugurate the Kosi bridge, Mr Modi said,”Those purporting to protect farmers actually want them to remain shackled with old rules.”
 Mr. Shah expressed gratitude to Mr. Modi in getting the Bills passed in the Lok Sabha. Mr. Nadda, releasing a special edition of _Kamal Sandesh_ , BJP’s mouthpiece, on Prime Minister Modi’s 70th birthday, also spoke strongly on the Farm Bills and revolutionary reforms which will be ushered in the agricultural sector.
 The SAD soft-peddling on withdrawing from the NDA, and the BJP’s support for the farm Bills does not augur an easy resolution to the issue within the alliance.
 The SAD-BJP alliance has been one of the oldest and most durable in the NDA with SAD leader Prakash Singh Badal considered a father figure to many leaders. Mr. Modi touched the senior leader’s feet before filing his nomination papers in Varanasi before the 2019 Lok Sabha polls.
 More importantly, the alliance had been forged keeping in mind the militancy that had taken place in Punjab in the 1980s and early 1990s. The alliance of SAD as a largely rural, orthodox Sikh party, and the BJP that counts Hindutva as an ideological base would, it was hoped bring together social harmony among religious orthodoxies, which it did. The farm Bills have hurt the SAD’s rural interest, and it is to be seen how it is reconciled with political interests of the BJP.

OTTAWA - Canada's first national pay-equity commissioner is having her term extended amid delays getting new pay-equity legislation into action.
 Karen Jensen was appointed a year ago to the Canadian Human Rights Commission with a mandate to help establish a new pay-equity division in preparation for the new law to take effect in 2020.
 Regulations needed to put the act to work are still in development, delaying its implementation and requiring an adjustment to extend Jensen's term.
 A right to equal pay for equal work was enshrined in the Canadian Human Rights Act in 1977 but a national law to require federally regulated employers to actively pursue pay equity did not get passed until December 2018.
 Jensen is to help employers implement the needed changes, ensure workers know their rights and help resolve disputes.
 On average in Canada, women earn 12 per cent less than men, the third largest gender pay gap among G7 countries and the seventh largest in the OECD.

Naomi Osaka will not be able to play in the French Open this year. On Thursday night, the tennis star, who recently won the US Open, went to social media to announce she has withdrawn from the tournament due to her suffering a hamstring injury. The French Open is slated to start on Monday, Sept. 21.
 "Unfortunately I won't be able to play the French Open this year," she wrote on social media. "My hamstring is still sore so I won't have enough time to prepare for the clay - these 2 tournaments came too close to each other for me this time. I wish the organizers and players all the best." Osaka is getting as much rest as she can after winning her third major title in her career last week. The 22-year old was able to defeat Victoria Azarenka in three sets, and it's her second US Open title in three years.
 "This one feels different overall because of the circumstances I'm under," Osaka said when comparing her victory this year from the one in 2018 where she defeated Serena Williams in the finals. "I wasn't in a bubble last time. There were a lot of fans last time. Yeah, I feel like, you know, in the end all I focus on is what I can control on the tennis court. That's what I did last time. I feel like that's what I did this time."
 Before the US Open, PopCulture.com spoke with Osaka who talked about her chances in the tournament. "I don't go to a tournament without thinking that I have a chance to win," Osaka said. "I feel really good right now and am extremely focused. I'll miss the fans this year because I love the energy that you feel in big stadiums, but it's for the better and will make a return to play with fans that much more special."
 Along with winning 2 US Open titles, she also won the Australian Open in 2019. The US Open was the first major tennis tournament since the Australian Open in January. The French Open was pushed back because of the COVID-19 pandemic. "I think that time away has really made me realize how much I love the competition," Osaka said. "It's what motivates me every day when I'm training. I can't wait to be back."

The Mayflower compact is a significant historical document, the "wave-rocked cradle of our liberties", as one historian evocatively put it. Signed by the Pilgrims and the so-called Strangers, the craftsmen, merchants and indentured servants brought with them to establish a successful colony, it agreed to pass "just and equal laws for the good of the Colony". The first experiment in New World self-government, some scholars even see it as a kind of American Magna Carta, a template for the Declaration of Independence and the US Constitution. Yet scholars at the Constitutional Center in Philadelphia suggest it had largely been forgotten by the time the Founding Fathers gathered at Independence Hall. Nor did the Pilgrims' belief in what Robert Hughes once called "the hierarchy of the virtuous" square with the more secular poetry of the Declaration of Independence that all men are created equal, and endowed by the creator with certain unalienable rights. Besides, the Mayflower compact started with a declaration of loyalty to King James.
 After Washington triumphed at Yorktown against the British, and this fledging nation started to assert itself in the world, the early drafters of the American story preferred to begin their histories with Christopher Columbus, even though the Italian explorer never stepped foot in North America. A new country that had just expelled the British did not want to be defined by its Englishness. Downplaying the Mayflower became an early act of decolonisation.
 Modern-day politicians have appropriated some of the messianic language from the settler era. Ronald Reagan liked to talk of "the city on the hill", ventriloquising the language used by John Winthrop as he voyaged towards New England. But Winthrop was a Puritan rather than a Pilgrim, and set sail on board the Arbella rather than the Mayflower. It's a subtle but important difference. Unlike the Pilgrims, the Puritans, who arrived 10 years later, were not separatists. They had remained in the Church of England hoping to banish its Catholic ways from within. The Massachusetts Bay Colony that they founded to the north, the settlement that became Boston, was far more influential in the shaping of America than the Plymouth Plantation.

The coronavirus pandemic is far from the minds of homeless migrants on the Greek island of Lesbos who are facing extreme hunger, dehydration, exhaustion and myriad illnesses, an aid worker has warned.
 Nearly 13,000 people, including thousands of children, were left homeless after Europe's largest camp for asylum-seekers was destroyed by fire this month.
 Those living in the notoriously overcrowded and unsanitary Moria camp were already facing violence, theft and difficult living conditions during their time there, said Francisca Bohle-Carbonell, in charge of medical activities for Doctors Without Borders (MSF) in Lesbos.
 Since the fires on the night of September 8, "the needs are the same as before: people are suffering, they don't have enough food, there is not enough water, they sleep outside", she told AFP.
 While more than half of the migrants have been moved since Thursday to a temporary new camp hastily built on the island, thousands continue to sleep by roads, in car parks and even inside a local cemetery.
 That makes them even more vulnerable as they are far from the radar of NGOs that were equipped to care for the sickest, Bohle-Carbonell said.
 "Many people have lost their medication, so there is no way at all to stabilise conditions that were already serious before. Now it's even worse because you can't even follow up," she said.
 \- 'Bad to worse' -
 The organisation has put in place "a team of health workers who walk the streets to really look for patients" and when they manage to find them, "you don't have to be a doctor or a nurse to see that it's going to be even worse" now they are on the streets, she says.
 As they were admitted to the new temporary camp, 174 people tested positive for coronavirus but were asymptomatic, according to humanitarian workers.
 Under the tents set up by the government and the United Nations, which are designed to hold 8,000 people, two quarantine zones have been set up.
 But for the migrants, the pandemic is not a priority as more urgent situations take hold, Bohle-Carbonell said. Many children have severe diarrhoea, and several pregnant women have miscarried.
 Health workers fear a scabies outbreak is imminent.
 "Panic attacks now are stronger, more intense, longer, harder to calm. Everything is going from bad to worse," she said.
 Many asylum-seekers have told AFP that they are wary of entering the new camp, or are doing so out of necessity.
 The UN refugee agency on Friday warned Greece that the new camp can only be temporary "as an emergency shelter facility".
 Six young Afghans have been arrested in connection with the fire, while the camp's destruction has strengthened calls for the migrants to be moved off the island, from both local residents and humanitarian organisations.

“It was really great to get back together,” she said. “We want to adhere (to health guidelines) so that things will be safe, but we don’t want people’s lives and missions to stop. We’re all glad to wear a mask and use hand sanitizer and do whatever we have to do.”
 Individual departments within the club have been handling the quarantine in different ways. Kelly said some departments have been doing newsletters, some of them have met on Zoom and some have met in person.
 “One of the things that’s obviously hurt us is that we pay our utilities and insurance mainly from (renting the clubhouse), so we haven’t had a lot of rentals,” Kelly said. “But some people have really stepped up and given us some donations in honor of different people, so that’s been awesome.”
 Kelly said a couple that was downsizing and moving donated their furniture. She said she and Martha Joiner posted photos of the furniture – including bedroom suites, couches and other items – online, and the club managed to make almost $500 from the sale. Another club member, Sheila Poston, also donated a piece of Bowflex exercise equipment, so the club made another $250 from that sale.
 “We’re going to do that again, so we’re asking each of the departments to give things they don’t need and would be willing to donate,” Kelly said. “One thing I found, personally, when I cleaned my house out and sold a bunch of stuff – people are not getting to go out, at least initially (at the beginning of the pandemic), to go out and shop, but they still want to buy things.”
 Kelly said the club is planing a yard sale for Oct. 30-31. It is also planning its first meeting with the general membership at 6 p.m. next Thursday, Sept. 24. Although they will be skipping the usual salad supper, they will hear from each of the departments and will listen to member Bobbie Weatherly talk about the new book she wrote. Weatherly also plans to donate a percentage of her book sales to the club, Kelly said.
 Rotary Club of Murray President Carmen Garland said the Rotary also shut down in March and did not have any meetings or functions for quite some time. When she took over as president of the club in July, she sent out a survey asking members how they wanted to proceed, and enough of them said they wanted to meet in person that they began gathering again every Thursday for lunch at the Murray Banquet Center. Rotarians currently have the option of attending in person or via Zoom, she said. She said the banquet center’s owner, Ron “R.G.” Gladden, has been great about spacing the tables apart and having his employees pack individual boxed lunches, as opposed to the buffet they used to have. Garland said the club now has to be a lot more precise in its weekly count of how many members plan to attend so they don’t have too much food.
 Garland said that since the club began meeting again, they usually have a solid 20 people in person, ranging from members in their mid-30s to some in their 80s. She said the number of people attending through Zoom has grown quite a bit as the weeks have gone on, and she said she was grateful to Rotarian Jonathan Eades for helping to set up the Zoom meetings.
 Unfortunately, the Rotary Club has not been able to provide the fun community activities and fundraisers that they normally have. They already have had to postpone the annual Max Hurt Memorial Golf Tournament until next spring. The backpack program – in which Rotarians form an assembly line to pack backpacks for children to take extra food home on the weekend – was also disrupted. Garland said the program is still on hold, but they are looking for sponsors so they can start it up again.
 Garland said the club also hosts the Apple Dumpling Project, which involves members coming to local schools and reading to children a book that demonstrates the Rotary’s Four-Way Test (Is it the truth? Is it fair to all concerned? Will it build goodwill and better friendships? Will it be beneficial to all concerned?). While members currently cannot visit schools to read to children, Garland said the club’s board of directors voted earlier this week to have Rotarians produce a video to drop off at schools so teachers can play the video and distribute the books themselves.
 Garland said the club is currently trying hard to find sponsors for November’s annual Tom Rushing Memorial Ham Breakfast. She said Murray Independent School District Superintendent Coy Samons has again given the club permission to use the Murray Middle School cafeteria as long as they take care of all the cleaning and maintain COVID-19 social distancing rules. She said people will have the option of getting breakfasts to go or to sit at a table with their families. The general public, though, will have to spaced safely apart if they eat inside, she said.
 Garland said she was excited that Murray Electric System committed this week to being the first sponsor of the annual Rotary Christmas Parade. She said participants obviously won’t be able to throw out candy to children this year and will have to space farther apart, but she still hoped the parade could carry on mostly as normal. She said she is optimistic that this is one annual tradition that won’t have to be canceled in 2020.
 “On a personal note, it would absolutely break my heart if we didn’t get enough sponsors to help with that parade and bring Santa Claus to our community into our children,” Garland said. “We need that.”

City were believed to be in the driving seat to sign the six-time Ballon d'Or winner if he left Catalonia.
 "I don't have to explain anything. I think Leo explained quite well his feelings, I don't have anything to add," Guardiola said ahead of City's first game of the new season, away to Wolves on Monday.
 "He is a Barcelona player, the club I love and (I have) nothing more to say."
 Messi will be able to leave Barca for free next summer but his former coach Guardiola, who was Barcelona's most successful-ever manager with 14 trophies in four years between 2008 and 2012, is in the dark over whether he is keen to come to Manchester.
 "I don't know," he said. "I cannot talk about the intentions from other people."
 In the aftermath of Messi's U-turn, City's summer transfer business in bringing in Ferran Torres from Valencia and Nathan Ake from relegated Bournemouth seems underwhelming.
 Guardiola's men won just the League Cup last season as they finished 18 points behind runaway champions Liverpool.
 But after spending hundreds of millions during four years in charge at Abu- Dhabi backed City, Guardiola insisted he had no complaints over the lack of signings so far in the window.
 "Since day one when I arrive here, I am more than satisfied with what I had in the team and I know the club do absolutely everything not just for me, for the team, for all of us to do our best," he said.

 "What is going to happen will happen. If we stay with the players we have, I will be happy. I never am going to complain about this. I am a lucky person to have these players to be in this club."
 Sergio Aguero will miss the start of the season due to a long-term knee injury, while Aymeric Laporte will also be absent on Monday due to a lack of pre-season training after testing positive for coronavirus.
