Halloween, more than almost any other holiday, is about fun. It's like New Year's, but with corn syrup instead of booze.      It began with the Gaelic festival Samhain, which celebrated the end of harvest while ushering in the dark half of the year, a spooky time when the boundaries between the living and spirit worlds were thought to become more porous. Brought to America by Irish and Scottish settlers, Halloween found footholds in the southern colonies, and developed a more playful, mischievous, and decidedly corny vibe.      Candy corn didn't start out as a Halloween treat but jumped on the bandwagon in the 1950s, as Halloween pivoted into a full embrace of processed sugar.      Corn officially became spooky with the release of "Children of the Corn," a 1984 movie about a Midwestern village where the kids took over and decided nobody was permitted to age beyond 17. In 1993, the world's first for-profit corn maze was built in Annville, Pennsylvania. Since then the tradition has taken off, and corn mazes now number in the thousands.      When I lived in New Mexico I learned about chicos, a type of Native American dried corn. "Chicos" means "little boys" in Spanish, as the kernels shrink when dried. The ones for sale at the store were dried to the hardness of popcorn, but when I make them at home I let them stay a bit chewy, like real- life versions of candy corn. Each batch of chicos has a unique character, with different levels of brown, crunchiness, chewiness and/or sweetness, depending on the corn and how long it's roasted.      Many Halloween corn mazes are closed this year, thanks to COVID-19. And door- to-door candy-begging is largely out, too. If treat-seekers are left to their own devices I'm fine with that, because processed sugar is poison, and a tradition that hinges on giving candy to kids isn't worth rescuing.      So allow me to tell you how I make chicos. I made about three dozen ears' worth, which won't last too long but is a nice stash. I will follow my chicos tips with a few recipes, one sweet and one savory, for how I used them.      Chicos   The only ingredient is corn, preferably with the husk on. Traditionally, the process involves a clay oven or "horno," but other ovens work, too. Ultimately, you're doing little more than drying out corn.      Although usually made with fresh corn, I've also made chicos with frozen corn, and the operation was surprisingly successful, even if the product lacked the soulful smokey flavor that a roasted corn husk imparts.      Turn the oven to 300 F and place the ears directly on the oven racks, not touching one another, and bake until the husks start to dry out and brown and even smoke a little, about three hours. When cool, peel off the husks. If using husked or frozen corn, skip this step.      Turn oven down to 225. Put the cobs on the oven racks, spaced so as not to touch one another, and bake until the kernels start to shrink and visibly dry out, about four hours. Let the ears cool completely, and rub off the kernels -- use the edge of a spoon if they are stubborn. Store in a plastic bag in a cool, dry place. The drier you get them, the longer they will store.      If making chicos from frozen corn, spread the kernels on a cookie sheet and bake at 225. They will take less time -- about two hours -- and will quickly turn brown and then black.      Chicos and Milk   Fill a bowl with chicos and milk, with sugar to taste. When the chicos are gone and you sip the sweet milk that remains, you may feel a distinct deja vu to a time, long ago, when you sipped the sweet leftover milk from a bowl of corn flakes or Frosted Flakes.      Beans with Chicos   A handful of chicos turns a pot of beans into something interesting and delightful. Served alongside rice, you've got a delicious meal with complete protein.   Serves 2   • 1 strip bacon (optional, recommended), chopped   • 1 tablespoon olive oil if skipping the bacon or if it's lean   • ½ cup minced onions   • 1 clove garlic, minced   • 1 teaspoon minced fresh oregano or thyme   • ¼ cup chicos   • 1 can plain beans (pinto, white, black, kidney) including the liquid   • 1 can water or stock   • 1 teaspoon paprika or chile powder to taste   • Salt, if the bacon doesn't add enough   Fry the bacon on medium heat. When half-crispy, about five minutes, add the onions, garlic and herbs. Fry until the onions become translucent. Add the chicos, beans, water and paprika, and stir together. Season with salt, if necessary. Heat to a simmer, stirring as necessary to prevent sticking. Adjust seasoning and serve.

 With two down, the Los Angeles Dodgers delivered time and time again.
 It still wasn't enough.
 All the Dodgers' runs in Saturday night's wild 8-7 World Series loss to the Tampa Bay Rays crossed the plate with two outs, raising their total to 57 of 94 in the postseason. The 60.6% clip is on track for a postseason record, topping the previous high of 59.3% by the 1992 Atlanta Braves.
 "Obviously didn't get the result that we wanted," Justin Turner said. "Wild game, back and forth, up and down. But like we said all along, we know it's not going to be easy. We know how difficult this is."
 For all their clutch hitting, the Dodgers couldn't make the last pitch they needed to close out Game 4. Despite outscoring Tampa Bay 25-19 and outhitting the Rays .282 to .229, Los Angeles finds itself tied at two games apiece.

Orlando Pirates coach Josef Zinnbauer felt his side were 'too casual' against AmaZulu at the Jonsson Kings Park Stadium on Saturday evening.
 The Buccaneers were denied maximum points and were forced to share a point with Usuthu after playing out to a 1-1 in their opening DStv Premiership fixture.
 Gabadinho Mhango handed Pirates the lead from the penalty spot in the 18th minute but Lehlohonolo Majoro levelled matters in the 33rd minute on the rebound after his initial penalty was saved by Wayne Sandilands.
 Zinnbauer admits that he was not happy with his sides first-half performance as were better in the second half, although it wasn't enough to secure all three points against a stubborn AmaZulu outfit.
 'We know AmaZulu have a good team. We can't expect to come here and get the three points for nothing. We have to work on this. For me, we had the game, we scored,' Zinnbauer told SuperSport TV.
 'And after we scored, we were too casual. And that was very hard for us to come back into the game. The second half is the style we want. First half, not good for me, second half better. And we have work ahead.
 'The problem was not the opponent, the problem was ourselves. We had not a normal build-up, not enough self-confidence, yes you can lose the ball, but we have too many turnovers and it was too easy.
 'Second half, we were more concentrated. But it's not enough. We have a point, yes, but for me, we didn't have enough chances to win the game.

CAFOs are facilities that house more than 1,000 animal units — which equates to about 700 dairy cows, 1,000 beef cattle or 2,500 hogs.
 With the moratorium’s expiration in two months, prospective CAFO operators could apply for county permits to erect new facilities before the county board considers any ordinances proposed by the study group.
 Area residents have expressed concern that continued large-scale agricultural development in the Driftless area — a geologic region with fractured bedrock — will lead to water contamination with nitrates and bacteria.
 A majority of study group members requested the moratorium be extended for an additional year while they complete their research, but — before reading the report — the county’s land conservation committee voted, 3-2, against doing so and has not forwarded the matter to the county supervisors for further consideration.
 Committee Chairman David Olson could not be reached for comment.
 County Board of Supervisors Chairman Tom Cornford cast the tie-breaking vote against extending the moratorium. He is unsure what will come of the report but said the county board is unlikely to take up the matter unless it is added to the body’s agenda by the land conservation committee.
 The report provided broad findings of fact pertaining to CAFOs along with an overview of environmental regulations enacted in other Wisconsin communities.
 “The real glitch is we don’t have a lot of the real strong county-relevant data,” said County Conservationist David Troester.
 Since the moratorium took effect, the county’s single CAFO operator, Howard Roth, applied for the state permits necessary to construct a second facility about 1½ miles west of Wisconsin 131 on Harvest Lane in Wauzeka.
 The plans call for the housing of 5,144 sows, 48 boars and 2,968 gilts.
 Roth awaits state approval before he applies for the required county permits. However, due to pandemic-related disruptions to the pork industry, he said the future of the facility is uncertain.
 Roth said, under present circumstances, construction is unlikely to commence before 2022.
 He believes the moratorium was enacted in violation of state law but has not decided what course of action he would take if the county board renews it.
 Staff attorneys with Midwest Environmental Advocates, an environmental law center based in Madison, have stated that successful legal challenges to a temporary moratorium are unlikely.
 Roth, who is president of National Pork Producers Council, said he does not worry only about his business but also for other farmers.
 “We have to increase our size, or we have to go out of business,” he said.
 Troester assured the county board that protecting groundwater does not have to come at the expense of farmers’ livelihoods.
 “We’re trying to find a balance where we can have successful agriculture and clean drinking water,” he said.

Zelenskiy says the survey results will help shape the government's agenda but many voters shrugged it off as irrelevant.
 "Most Ukrainians may need cannabis to forget about the main problem -- broad poverty," Ihor Dryhailo, 48, an engineer in Kyiv who voted for Zelenskiy last year but expressed disappointment with his performance as president. "The government's words differ from its deeds, and it has been unable to stop a majority of Ukrainians from sliding into poverty."
 Observers predicted political pressure will continue to mount on Zelenskiy after the municipal election, with political rivals likely to press for an early parliamentary vote.
 "The local elections will set the stage for an attack on Zelenskiy from all sides," said Volodymyr Fesenko, the director of Penta Center, an independent think tank. "The right-wing and the left-wing forces will rock the boat and try to provoke a new political crisis, seeking to at least challenge the parliament majority."
 Zelenskiy also faces growing pressure from a one-time ally. Billionaire Ihor Kolomoyskyi, who owned the TV station that aired the sitcom that made Zelenskiy famous, hoped to have the 2016 nationalization of his PrivatBank reversed, but Zelenskiy has refused to overturn the decision.
 "In retaliation, Kolomoyskyi began to methodically ruin Zelenskiy's majority in parliament, fielding several new parties," political expert Karasev said.
 Karasev observed that recent decentralization efforts that gave broad authority to local mayors and councils would make the outcome of Sunday's local elections particularly significant.
 "The results of the local elections could come as a cold shower for Zelenskiy, who will have to counter both the parties controlled by the oligarchs and the strengthening regional elites," he said.

Over the years we have across many such designs that might inspire the Chennai-based manufacturer to take them to production levels. Images of one such design have come across in the form of Enduro 650 which seems to be based on Royal Enfield Interceptor 650. Facebook user Motoskteches has uploaded these renderings to his social media page. While previous design renderings based on Scrambler 650 have trended on the internet on multiple occasions, the user in this case claims that it is purely an Endurance bike. One might find it difficult to distinguish between a scrambler and a traditional enduro. However, the latter looks inclined to travel on broken or no tarmac whereas the former looks more content to take the streets. Design One highlight, as shown in the pictures, are the tyres with a distinct thicker profile at rear in comparison to the front just as typical enduro bikes. The wheels, however, are of 21-inch size for front and 17-inch at rear. The Enduro 650 is equipped with spoke wheels but anything other than that would surely look like a misfit in an enduro. Signature enduro elements such as minimum body panels, upright stance and high ground clearance are common to these images. The bikes also get high-mounted fenders on front and rear thus leaving a huge gap between them and the wheels. Rest of the bike gets the same retro-classic touch with round headlamps, round taillights, a flat seat and a tall handlebar. The Facebook user says that this bike will run on limited electronic gimmicks and technological gadgets and it will be more about the mechanical character which adds to the riding pleasure. As the designer puts it, the said bike has been rendered as an old-fashioned Enduro which is simple, logical, very practical and could be offered at an affordable cost. Current range of 650cc motorcycles from Royal Enfield Only time can tell whether Royal Enfield will go for an Endurance motorcycle by expanding its 650cc range. They could plan to launch a scrambler based on the 650cc platform. Currently, the brand\u2019s 650 range of bikes consists of the Interceptor 650 and Continental GT 650. A cruiser codenamed KX650 is also in the pipelines as it has been spotted on a couple of occasions recently. The 649cc parallel-twin air-cooled motor is capable of generating 47 bhp and 52 Nm of peak torque. Source

And we have opportunities right now, for example, and I talked about today, to advance an Iranian agreement on their nuclear program that could be historic. We may not get it, but there's a chance that it could still happen. I have not yet given up on the possibility that both Israelis and Palestinians can see their self-interest in a peace deal that would provide Israel security that's recognized by its neighbors and make sure that Palestinians have a state of their own.

Enzo Campo ha ricordato anche il grande impegno del sindacato per la memoria. “Per anni la Cgil commemorava sempre gli stessi caduti. Abbiamo iniziato ad andare casa per casa, in tutte le famiglie, chiedendo scusa, ricomponendo la memoria di tutti i sindacalisti assassinati – ha detto il segretario generale - Una storia che abbiamo iniziato a ricostruire con l'urlo di Antonella Azoti che, davanti all'albero Falcone, ha chiesto di ricordare l'assassinio di suo padre. E avrò sempre davanti l'immagine di Santa, 93 anni, la figlia di Andrea Raia. Al funerale è venuta con l'abito della festa, come per un matrimonio. A Villabate, Vincenzo Sansone è stato ricordato dopo 69 anni. Il sindaco di Palermo Orlando è stato con noi in questo processo, intitolando le 'vie dei diritti' ai sindacalisti uccisi. E' passato il messaggio che la nostra memoria, di cui siamo orgogliosi, non è solo ricordo ma è memoria della città, memoria collettiva, patrimonio nazionale”.   Al termine del suo intervento Campo ha salutato e rivolto un ringraziamento a tutto il mondo della cultura e dello spettacolo che in questi anni è stato vicino alle lotte dei lavoratori, offrendo al mondo del lavoro un prezioso contributo artistico. Un saluto particolare ha voluto dedicarlo “a tutte le compagne e i compagni che in questi anni, con sacrificio e dedizione, hanno collaborato a rendere grande la Cgil”.
