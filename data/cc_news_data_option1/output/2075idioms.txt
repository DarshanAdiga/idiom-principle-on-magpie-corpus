"The technical aspects are taken care by the website/platform. So, there is no human error for pairings, results and standings. Arbiters/Umpires are also not needed," he told PTI.
 "…But, the challenge is to ensure fair games and see that there is no cheating. We have to ensure thorough checking to avoid computer cheating (especially in cash events). Another aspect is to allow players to reconnect and rejoin if their internet gets disconnected (especially in India)," he added.
 He said it was difficult to compare across the board events and online tournaments.
 "The players enjoy online games as they can play from the comfort of their homes. It is also faster than normal chess. But, there is very less reward/recognition to win online than over the board events. People love both for their own unique ways," he said.

Several Indian Grandmasters said the online tournaments kept them occupied. Grandmaster B Adhiban and Woman Grandmaster D Harika said online chess was helpful during times like the lockdown as it helps one stay in touch with the game.
 "I like playing online chess, as I feel quite relaxed and you can be very fast." Adhiban said.
 On her part, Harika said, "It is very good in these times when you are in a lockdown."
 GM R R Laxman, who also took part in online events regularly, said: "It is a wonderful initiative. It provides players practice and opportunity to stay in touch with the game.
 "Online tournaments provide up-and-coming a players chance to compete with GMs and higher-rated players. At such times, the online events are a boon," Laxman added.
 He said there was the added incentive of prize money also.
 Rakesh Kulkarni, an International Master and Director at chess.com-India, which has been conducting events regularly during the lockdown, said organising (online events) was a different kind of challenge as it required to ensure fair games.

It was a rocker style we got from Walmart that had built in speakers, volume control, even an extension port that plugged into various Nintendo/ps/Xbox units so your wired controller wasn't stretched to the max.

LaRoda said: “In the long term they will benefit the industry. In the short term not so much and the reason I say that is because it will take persons some time to get out of the stagnation of this lock down. If the lockdown continues for another month that will put commercial fishermen on the threshold of preparing for the lobster season.”

This story is part of our Senior Spotlight series where the Chieftain will collect stories from every local spring team's seniors in order to recognize their hard work despite a canceled season from the coronavirus pandemic.
   
 Pueblo County High School track team underwent a transition this season as coach Diana Tiffany-Hardy took over the head coaching position for both girls and boys teams.
   
 The girls team, Tiffany-Hardy said stood out to her because of their ability to take care of each other.
   
 "They would make sure each other was where they needed to be," Tiffany-Hardy said. "When the time came, they would hold the blocks, help each other warm up, if a teammate needed something, they would do what they could. They were a solid team, the type of team that was a unit."
   
 Tiffany-Hardy said this extended to the boys team as well, noting they were a unified team before officially becoming so.
   
 The returning seniors for the girls team include, Audrie Brown, Brennah Guerrero, Taylor Holland, Brittney Miller, Risa Myers, Bella Radiff and Madison Thatcher.
   
 "Audrie Brown is a sprinter, she's kind of a meat and potato athlete where you can say 'Here I want you to go do this,' and she'll go do it," Tiffany-Hardy said. "Brittney Miller, I expected her to be on most of the sprint relays and I expected her to do well.
   
 "(Myers) and (Guerrero) ran cross country for me and they are powerful athletes. (Myers) she grew so much through cross country this year; I was expecting her to blossom. (Guerrero) leads with integrity and work ethic. She encourages other athletes to do their best, but she really leads just by who she is and her performance."
   
 Tiffany-Hardy added, "(Thatcher) would always give her best. (Holland) is a tough girl, she works hard and plays hard."
   
 Radiff, who is the niece of well-known girls swim and track coach, Dan Radiff, was able to compete on the team while her uncle was still coaching.
   
 "He had the pleasure of coaching her," Tiffany-Hardy added. "She's one that you could put into a sprint or a relay and she would give you her best. She was actually learning how to be a hurdler this year as well. She just works so hard."
   
 Radiff plans on going into the military after graduation, and Tiffany-Hardy recalled how Radiff came to her before the season began to prepare.
   
 "She had to do a fitness test and run a mile under a certain time," Tiffany- Hardy said. "Had to do so many sit ups and pushups. She asked me if I would time her, I think she had to run the mile in under 10 minutes, and she did it in 7:29. She went from wanting to be an athlete to being an athlete."
   
 First year seniors who planned on competing this season include, Jacelynn Trujillo, Franchesca Selle and Melina Farris.
   
 "(Trujillo) and (Selle) are strong enough athletes they would have fit in anywhere," Tiffany-Hardy said. "(Farris) is a fantastic soccer player, I believe she is going full ride to a D1 school on a soccer and probably academic scholarship as well.
   
 "She always wanted to come out for track and couldn't because of soccer. So, we made an arrangement for her to come out and long jump. She was just phenomenal in the practices she had."
   
 Tiffany-Hardy added the seniors of her team were all cut from the same cloth, demonstrating drive and accountability for the upcoming athletes.
   
 "It's not often you get 23 kids in one class that come out and are all workers," Tiffany-Hardy said. "They are all in it for the team, as well as for themselves."

AMore than 80 percent of gay relationships got their start online before the pandemic began, MATCH, and that number is surely higher now. So if you got on gay dating/hookup apps instead of flirting with random men, you would be talking to a self-selected group of men who are inviting other men to flirt with them. You’ll still face rejection, of course, and you’ll still get hurt. To live is to suffer, as some philosopher or other once said, but the suffering is easier to bear if you’re getting your dick sucked once in a while.
