Trump has often claimed that social media sites are biased in favor of the Democrats, an argument he made to attack Google Search back in 2018. Trump has also leveled the same charges against Twitter and Facebook. The president could be hurting his own reelection chances since the Trump campaign advertises heavily on Facebook and the president often uses Twitter to broadcast his policies such as his desire to regulate social media for example.
   
 Jack Balkin, a Yale University constitutional law professor, says, "The president is trying to frighten, coerce, scare, cajole social media companies to leave him alone and not do what Twitter has just done to him. The professor called the executive order "mostly smoke and mirrors" and said that it would have little effect legally. The executive order will ask the FCC to regulate Section 230, which is part of a 1996 law called the Communications Decency Act. Trump's executive order will require the FCC to determine whether a social media company is moderating content using deceptive policies and if the company is not following its own terms of service. The FCC will reportedly be asked in the executive order to look at whether the editing of content by social media firms should lead these companies to lose their Section 230 protection.
   
 Another part of the draft executive order calls for the White House Office of Digital Strategy to release a tool that will allow consumers to make complaints about social media sites that practice censorship (you can see the irony here, right?). The complaints will be sent to the Justice Department (DOJ) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). The FTC will then investigate a complaint to see if the actions taken by a social media company violate the law. These complaints will be publicly available. In addition, the Attorney General will create a working group made up of state attorneys general that will look at state laws to make sure that they disallow unfair and deceptive acts to be committed by online platforms.
   
 As you might imagine, Twitter's fact-checking of the president has ignited a political firestorm. On FOX News yesterday, FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr called out Twitter  stating that the company had decided "to engage the president of the United States with its own partisan, political viewpoint."

Callahan's quick response alone tells you the impact Burkes had, even over his short career at Nebraska.
 In 2007 Callahan made the decision to start Burkes at right tackle before a game at Texas, where the Longhorns had the nation's sixth-best rushing defense. The Huskers fell short that day, but Burkes helped pave the way up front for running back Marlon Lucky to rush for over 100 yards on 24 carries against a UT front that featured many future NFL players. Burkes wasn't even familiar with the entire offense at that point, but his natural athletic ability allowed him to make plays and win up-front.
 Heading into the 2008 season, Burkes was expected to have a breakthrough sophomore year under new head coach Bo Pelini, but medical conditions forced him to walk away from the game after that season.
 “He has all the tools,” former NU and NFL offensive lineman Matt Slauson said in the spring of 2008 in a _Lincoln Journal Star_ article. “He has the longest arms I’ve ever seen. His power and his legs, as soon as he locks onto a guy and extends his arms, they’re going down every time. He has amazing power. … He can grab a guy and just toss him on the ground the way Carl Nicks would, but with a lot more aggression than Nicks.”
 Comparing Burkes to Nicks is all you need to know. Before injuries ended Nicks' NFL career, he was the highest-paid offensive guard in league history. He also won a Super Bowl ring in New Orleans.
 Current LSU secondary coach Bill Busch recruited Burkes to Nebraska out of Pheonix in the class of 2007, and at that time there was no doubt he was eventually headed to the NFL.

Then there have been the baseless accusations that China was stealing US research on a Covid-19 vaccine; more importantly Washington has come up with new sanctions against Huawei, with a planned banning of the use of American equipment for manufacturing by any company of semi-conductor chips used by Huawei -- going for the jugular of a company that is an icon and a symbol of Beijing's technological ambitions.

Before jumping to conclusions, you should keep in mind that's probably not the SM-R845's full name, so we're still left guessing whether Samsung will go with a Galaxy Watch 2 or Watch Active 3 moniker. On the decidedly bright side of things, the sketch does reveal an unusual wealth of information about this large next-gen smartwatch model, including its 45mm case size, stainless steel build, Gorilla Glass DX protection, 5 ATM water resistance rating, MIL- STD-810G durability, GPS functionality, and built-in LTE support.
   
 Naturally, we expect the device to come in Wi-Fi-only variants in addition to LTE-enabled flavors, as well as a smaller size carrying the aforementioned SM-R855 model number, and last but not least, some different materials too. In fact, SamMobile recently revealed Samsung has super-premium titanium variants in the pipeline alongside traditional stainless steel and aluminum models.
   
 Unfortunately, the FCC has absolutely no insight into any other specs and features to make public right now, although we do know a significant storage upgrade is brewing, as is a solid battery size improvement. This definitely sounds more like a Galaxy Watch 2 than a Galaxy Watch Active 3 to us, but obviously, we'll have to wait for an official announcement to find out which of Samsung's top-notch Apple Watch rivals will be followed up soon.

George Robert Green      Bonita Springs, - George Robert Green, age 85, of Bonita Springs, FL and Avon, CT passed away peacefully at home on April 2, 2020 following a courageous battle with cancer. Born on October 23, 1934, he was the son of the late George and Pearl Green of Deltona, FL and brother of the late Arlene Mangiafico, also of Deltona.      He met Patricia (Sheehan) Green, his beloved wife of 62 years, in West Hartford, CT and they later settled their family in the towns of Cheshire and Farmington. George earned his CPA license and embarked on a successful career in business. For many years, he served as Chief Financial Officer of the Siemon Company in Watertown, CT, from which he retired in 1995. He was also an active community volunteer, serving as a past President of the Watertown Rotary Club, a former board member of Thomaston Savings Bank, and a member of the Watertown/Oakville Chamber of Commerce.      Upon his retirement, George enjoyed spending time at his Florida home where he was known to be a fierce tennis player and a reluctant golfer. He will be remembered for his enormous generosity, sharp wit, and hearty laugh. A devoted husband, father, and grandfather, his family will be forever grateful for the constant love and support he so graciously offered them throughout his life.      In addition to his wife, George leaves behind his three loving sons and their spouses: Kevin Green of Farmington; Jeffrey Green and John Ridge of Silver Spring, MD; and Douglas Green and Donna Riccardi of Ipswich, MA.

o The increase in business corporation tax cash collections is primarily attributable to a jump in estimated payments of $35.3 million in year-to-date FY 2020. This increase includes $37.3 million of income tax payments received from pass-through entities on behalf of their shareholders. In the FY 2020 enacted budget, a provision was included that allowed pass-through entities to make income tax payments on behalf of their shareholders at a rate of 5.99% with the shareholders receiving a credit on their personal income tax returns in the amount of the income taxes paid by the pass-through entity on their behalf. It is expected that any increase in estimated payments received from pass-through entities for this purpose will be offset by reduced final payments or increased refunds paid to the shareholders on their personal income tax returns.

It's hard to find any prosumer cameras that take higher-than-4K footage, much less a 360 degree action cam. Two GoPro video technologies also help the MAX stand out: Max HyperSmooth, a highly sophisticated type of image stabilization to compensate for very jerky motions (think biking on a bumpy road), and Max TimeWarp, which allows you to take ultra smooth time lapse footage.

 “While Lassen County had no COVID-19 confirmed cases for the past three months, we were fully aware of the risk that the virus could come to our community” by way of county visitors or residents who traveled outside the county, Korver said. “Unfortunately, this did happen, and we now have a serious problem. We need to contain the spread of the virus in Lassen County now.”
 Overall, there have been five confirmed COVID-19 cases in the county, but the results of 222 tests were still pending Thursday morning.
 Lassen is the first county to officially roll back its reopening rules since California has started allowing local governments to further relax coronavirus-related restrictions provided they meet certain metrics.

“The season was a little tough getting started, we had to shake some things up early to make it more competitive as a whole,” he said. “I made a decision to do some things different on how we qualify for the team and make us better as a group and really separate the kids that really wanted to fish and really wanted to be competitive. But after we had a few bumps in the road — we got past those very quickly, things just started to go really good with our best event as a group trying to qualify for the top six positions right before the COVID-19 shut downs started to happen.”
 Stewart said that based on what he’d seen in practices and at tournaments so far, this was going to be the best six duos his team would have had enter into the regional tournament in a long time.
 Unfortunately, though, Stewart and the North Laurel bass fishing team won’t get a chance to see what could have been of this season and what the Jaguars could have accomplished at the regional tournament this year.
 “Things happen that are out of your control; you set your self up for success as well as you can and sometimes outside forces come into play that you have no control over and that’s just a tough life lesson for these kids, but it will make them strong in the long run,” Stewart said.
 Though the Jaguars didn’t get a season, Stewart said that those student- athletes on his team that took fishing seriously haven’t let the cancellation stop them from getting in some practice, something that Stewart said is due to the fact that his team is one of the most dedicated around.
 “Throughout the lockdown I would see kids on the lake here and there fishing,” he said. “So they where fishing and competing against the opponent in fishing that beats you the most — the fish.”

HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) — Connecticut's policy allowing transgender girls to compete as girls in high school sports violates the civil rights of athletes who have always identified as female, the U.S. Education Department has determined in a decision that could force the state to change course to keep federal funding and influence others to do the same.A letter from the department's civil rights office, a copy of which was obtained Thursday by The Associated Press, came in response to a complaint filed last year by several cisgender female track athletes who argued that two transgender female runners had an unfair physical advantage.The office said in the 45-page letter that it may seek to withhold federal funding over the policy, which allows athletes to participate under the gender with which they identify. The policy is a violation of Title IX, the federal civil rights law that guarantees equal education opportunities for women, including in athletics, the office said.It has “denied female student-athletes athletic benefits and opportunities, including advancing to the finals in events, higher level competitions, awards, medals, recognition, and the possibility of greater visibility to colleges and other benefits,” according to the letter, which is dated May 15.The Connecticut Interscholastic Athletic Conference says its policy complies with a state law barring schools from discriminating against transgender students.“Connecticut law is clear and students who identify as female are to be recognized as female for all purposes — including high school sports," the athletic conference said in a statement. “To do otherwise would not only be discriminatory but would deprive high school students of the meaningful opportunity to participate in educational activities, including inter-scholastic sports, based on sex-stereotyping and prejudice sought to be prevented by Title IX and Connecticut state law.”The federal decision carries implications beyond Connecticut, said Roger Brooks, an attorney for the Alliance Defending Freedom, which represents the girls who brought the complaint.“Around the nation, districts are going to want to be reading this, because it does have legal implications,” he said. “It is a first decision from the agency charged with enforcing Title IX addressing the question of whether males on the playing field or on the track are depriving girls of opportunities consistent with Title IX.”The decision by the civil rights office names the conference, along with the school districts for which the transgender runners and those filing the complaint competed — Glastonbury, Bloomfield, Hartford, Cromwell, Canton and Danbury.The office said it will “either initiate administrative proceedings to suspend, terminate, or refuse to grant or continue and defer financial assistance” to the conference and those districts or refer the cases to the U.S. Department of Justice.In its letter, the civil rights office said that it notified the athletic conference and the school districts of its pending decision in February, but that later negotiations failed to result in an agreement.“All that today’s finding represents is yet another attack from the Trump administration on transgender students,” said Chase Strangio, deputy director of the funding initiative Trans Justice.“Trans students belong in our schools, including on sports teams, and we aren’t backing down from this fight,” Strangio said.The dispute, already the subject of a federal lawsuit, centers on two transgender sprinters, Terry Miller and Andraya Yearwood, who have frequently outperformed their competitors, winning a combined 15 girls state indoor or outdoor championship races since 2017, according to the lawsuit.The American Civil Liberties Union's lawyers for the transgender athletes have argued both are undergoing hormone treatments that have put them on an equal footing with the girls they are competing against.Brooks said he hopes the judge in the lawsuit will take the Education Department decision into consideration.One of the plaintiffs, Chelsea Mitchell, won two state indoor title races over Miller this year.Mitchell, a senior, said Thursday that she is both happy and relieved by the Department of Education's decision.“It feels like we are finally headed in the right direction, and that we will be able to get justice for the countless girls along with myself that have faced discrimination for years," she said. “It is liberating to know that my voice, my story, my loss, has been heard; that those championships I lost mean something.”The plaintiffs sought to block the participation of Miller and Yearwood, both seniors, from spring track meets, which were later canceled because of the COVID-19 pandemic. They were also seeking to erase all records set by the transgender athletes.Connecticut is one of 18 states, along with Washington, D.C., that allow transgender high school athletes to compete without restrictions, according to Transathlete.com.Several other states have polices barring the participation of transgender athletes, and Idaho recently became the first to pass a law banning transgender women from competing in women’s sports.The ACLU and Legal Voice filed a federal lawsuit contending that law violates the U.S. Constitution because it is discriminatory and an invasion of privacy.Copyright 2020 Associated Press.

Busch would go on to say this week he felt Burkes was an eventual first-round draft pick, as he was a part of the "Phoenix Five" in Nebraska's 2007 recruiting class. Future NFL draft picks Prince Amukamara, Marcel Jones and Eric Hagg would all go on to join Burkes in Lincoln from Phoenix in 2007.
 Amukamara was a first-round draft pick in 2011 - the last one in program history. Burkes was destined for that same path, has he held 63 different scholarship offers in high school.
 He joined Slauson, Tyler Moore, Jacob Hickman and Brenden Jaimes as the only true freshmen to have started a game on the offensive line in school history.
 What's unique about Burkes from the others is Slauson played a year of Prep School before college, Hickman was a grayshirt that had a full-year on campus, and Moore was an early enrollee. Both Jaimes and Burkes were the only two linemen in that group of five that started as true freshmen without being on campus for the spring.
