The Uthrittathi boat race at Pampa in Aranmula will be staged in line with the COVID-19 protocol here on Friday. The event will be mostly symbolic in nature.
 The most notable absentee this year will be the festive atmosphere as the participation of Palliyodams has been limited to just one. As per the event schedule, the Llaka-Idayaranmula Palliyodam, carrying only 24 persons on board, will be accorded a reception by the Palliyoda Seva Sanghom at the temple ghats. The low water level in the river too has cast a shadow over the smooth conduct of the event.
 According to the organisers, 25 snake-boats had participated in the annual regatta even during the floods two years ago. Plans to organise the event by lining up 52 boats this time had to be scrapped due to the COVID-19 restrictions.

For the full year, Assurant estimates net operating income per diluted share, excluding catastrophe losses, to rise in the band of 12-16% from the figure reported in 2019 ($9.21). The improvement can primarily be attributed to continuous expense discipline and profitable growth across all business segments. The company anticipates double-digit growth in net operating income, excluding catastrophes. The upside is likely to come on the back of earnings growth within Global Lifestyle and Global Housing. However, net operating income is estimated to remain lower for the second half of 2020 compared with the first half. For 2020, net operating loss in Corporate and Other are expected between $86 million and $90 million, mainly due to reduced investment income partly offset by decline in general expenses. Interest expense and preferred dividends are anticipated to be around $81 million and $19 million, respectively.

They do what they can to take precautions. Sheriff Bill Puett said his staff ensure deputies know if they are responding to a COVID-19-positive location.
 "Protocols are ... we're still going to respond to service if it’s a COVID- positive address. The deputies know, they put on their personal protective equipment and they’re aware of that. They try to be cautious but at the end of the day we still have calls for service and still have to serve the community," Puett said.
 Angle said arrests must be made in close proximity, but additional steps now are taken.
 "Obviously there are times when we do have to make an arrest and be in close proximity and that’s when we utilize our PPE and use good practices, utilize our training that we received for the pandemic and things have gone relatively smoothly,” Angle said.

He was requested by a former employer to assist in Vietnam. His family was not allowed in the country, so they lived in the Philippines. While in Vietnam, Swiderski worked closely with the military on civil operations and rural development. He said he built his own port because the military kept kicking him off theirs when he was expecting deliveries.
 Swiderski was forced to flee the country when his life was threatened.
 "They killed his chief officer, left a bullet on his desk, and said the next one was for him. He went to Taiwan, still trying to get his people out of Vietnam," said Uribe. "He always told me he was a blessed man. He should have been dead three times."
 Swiderski retired after 17 years with USAID.
 "He met a lot of famous military people and powerful people. He was an avid hunter and fisher; he hunted with the mayor of Paris," said Uribe. "He's led an interesting life."
 After retirement, the Swiderskis lived in Napa, California.
 "He was still pretty young, so he worked. Then, they traveled and had a 'summer home' in Florida," said Uribe. "They loved the beach."
 In 2003, the Swiderskis moved to Tahlequah.
 "He never dreamed he would be living back in Oklahoma. It's my fault because I moved here," said Uribe. "He loved Oklahoma when he first moved here. He said the people were so nice."
 Uribe has two sons, and Swiderski used to take them fishing, and taught them how to shoot a bow and BB guns.
 "He encouraged them to be physically active," sad Uribe. "It must have stayed with them because they are both still active."
 After 73 years, Swiderski and his bride are still married. Gilda, 93, is bedridden most days.
 "He is so attentive to my mom. He's always checking on her," said Uribe. "They hold hands still."
 Off and on for the past few years, Swiderski has been on hospice.
 "Being on hospice doesn't mean you're dying. It's a great service. He does physical therapy and loves it. He does some things we didn't even know he could do anymore," said Uribe. "He just stopped driving last year."
 He and Gilda currently receive 24-hour, in-home assistance. Their home health services were cut back when the coronavirus hit the area.
 "He is one of the most thankful men. He's so appreciative of everything," said Lori Dyer, caregiver. "He's a proud soldier."
 Swiderski used to enjoy watching TV, but he now has hearing issues. Reading and opening mail are also pastimes. He especially enjoys receiving letters from his grandsons and other family.
