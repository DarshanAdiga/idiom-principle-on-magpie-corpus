Bruce has had his fair share of stick since Friday but if you put a teamsheet out that contains Allan Saint-Maximin, Miguel Almiron, Callum Wilson and a defence that kept Everton at bay, surely he's entitled to more than a limp display like the trip to Southampton.
 Bruce stated that he was concerned about how quickly Newcastle go "up and down" between some games but something didn't seem right about the clash at Southampton.
 In previous years, journalists were able to get a better feel for what was going on behind the scenes via chats with players before they boarded the team bus after putting the world to rights after a defeat.
 That communication has been taken away since lockdown due to players being in a Covid-19 bubble, but even then Fabian Schar's post-game interview after the 2-0 loss at Southampton would have left any neutral fan believing there were potential issues.

             New listings by Chinese companies reached a record high at the US stock market this year despite some turbulence. Observers said that more listings might follow in the coming year as the market becomes increasingly optimistic that the incoming Joe Biden administration might work to improve economic relations with China.      So far this year, 26 Chinese IPOs have been held in the US, with a total worth of $29 billion, the highest since 2014, according to statistics from Refinitiv, a market data provider.      "Most investors in China see Biden as a fresh impetus, one that will be more predictable and less arbitrary," Dong Dengxin, director of the Finance and Securities Institute at the Wuhan University of Science and Technology, told the Global Times on Wednesday.      "It means it is likely that more companies will go public in the US under his administration," Dong said.      Stock markets on the Chinese mainland responded warmly to Biden's election victory, with all three stock market indexes rising on Monday.      While it is unlikely that a Biden administration, expected to take office on January 20, will reverse Trump's hard stance against China in terms of trade and finance, the new administration is expected to be more "consistent" and "more respectful of market principles", Dong said.      Chinese companies have been under the threat of delisting from the Trump administration, which is trying to impose stronger US accounting standards on them. According to the US Treasury in August, Chinese companies that do not manage to comply with those standards will be delisted from US exchanges by the end of 2021, Reuters reported earlier.      Several big Chinese companies listed in the US, including technology giants JD.com, Alibaba and NetEase, launched secondary listings at Shanghai or Hong Kong exchanges against this backdrop. Since February last year, 16 Chinese companies have delisted from the US market, including Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp, which became the biggest listing on the Chinese mainland in a decade when it was relisted in Shanghai in July.      However, uncertainties could persist over the relationship between China and the US, and for smaller Chinese companies, especially those valued at less than $100 million, the appeal of Chinese markets, especially the Hong Kong stock exchange, might dwarf those of US exchanges, Dong said.      "The Hong Kong market has grown more diverse and inclusive after reforms starting from 2018, and usually a Hong Kong listing is less costly," Dong added.

60 Mn eHealth ready households are expected to reach 140 Mn by FY 25. This growth is going to be driven on the back of growing the online shopper base, and increase in willingness to try eHealth. As per the 3 growth scenarios as discussed above, this translates to a penetration of ~30 to 50% of eHealth ready household base, by FY 25. eHealth Ready Addressable Market is derived through multiplying average order value (AOV) of outpatient medical purchase and yearly medical purchase frequency with eHealth ready addressable households. After applying the calculations, it is found that eHealth currently has a $11 Bn ready addressable market, out of which only ~11% has been tapped at $1.2 Bn eHealth GMV.

Trace amine-associated receptors (TAARs) are a class of receptors that detect biogenic amines, which are the products of decarboxylation of amino acids. In other words, each amino acid has its amine,’ says Professor Gainetdinov. ‘As a rule, the acid part is removed by the enzymes (decarboxylases) that catalyze decarboxylation. They are found in our body or in certain bacteria that metabolize amino acids, for example, when bacteria break down tissues. Little wonder, the trace amines are abundant in fermented foods, such as cheese, wine, beer, and cured meats.’

Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger said at a news conference Wednesday that his office wants the process to begin by the end of the week and he expects it to take until Nov. 20.President-elect Joe Biden leads President Donald Trump by about 14,000 votes out of nearly 5 million votes counted in the state. Nearly all ballots have been counted, though counties have until Friday to certify their results.After results from the hand recount are certified, the losing campaign can then request another recount, which will be performed by machine, Raffensperger said.There is no mandatory recount law in Georgia, but state law provides that option to a trailing candidate if the margin is less than 0.5 percentage points.

FORT BELVOIR, Va. (AP) — A sword from the defense of Fort McHenry in the War of 1812. A stopped wristwatch recovered from the wrecked E-Ring of the Pentagon on the Sept. 11 attacks. The Sherman tank that first broke through enemy lines at the Battle of the Bulge in World War II. Those are just a few of the artifacts that tell the 245-year story of the nation's largest and oldest military branch at the new National Museum of the United States Army. Planning for the museum has been in the works for more than a decade, and construction began in 2017. Early plans called for an opening in late 2019, but delays pushed it back to 2020, and then the pandemic hit. Those delays, though, provided an opportunity for a debut that coincides with Veterans Day. Paul Morando, chief of exhibits at the museum, said the goal is to tell the stories of soldiers who served, and tell some of the stories that may not be as well known to the general public. “We didn't want to make a hallway of heroes,” he said. Morando said the museum does not shy away from discussing painful aspects of Army history. “We don't shy away from the more sensitive subjects the Army's been involved in,\" he said. ”We mention My Lai. We mention Abu Ghraib. We mention Wounded Knee. These events are put out in a factual way for the public to interpret or learn more about, but we do not ignore those subjects,” he said. One issue explored in detail is the Army's use of Japanese-American soldiers in a segregated combat units during World War II. The 442nd Regimental Combat Team was formed in 1943 after more than 12,000 second-generation Japanese Americans known as Nisei responded to a call for volunteers.

Trump did meet with his political and White House advisers on Tuesday to discuss the next steps in his legal strategy, a person familiar with the matter said, and offered no signs he plans to concede the election. Behind the scenes, Trump's refusal to concede has prompted senior officials across the government to spread word that any cooperation with Biden's team is forbidden, officials at agencies and the White House said.
 But he remains absent when it comes to doing the work of the federal government.
 President-elect Joe Biden, meanwhile, is keeping a presidential schedule, holding a news conference on Tuesday, fielding calls from world leaders and meeting with his newly appointed coronavirus advisory board.
 A review of Trump's daily public schedule since October 2, when he was diagnosed with Covid-19, shows a paucity of official White House events in the lead-up to the November 3 election and in the subsequent days.
 Of course, the daily schedule does not include all of a President's meetings and activities. But nearly 50 campaign rallies, the lack of official meetings over more than a month -- the work of being President of the United States -- particularly amid a global pandemic, is notable. Trump's last intelligence briefing on the schedule was for October 2, the morning after he tested positive.

According to a _CNN_ report, police suspected that the October 30 accident took place after Marston fell asleep at the wheel, resulting in his pickup truck careening off the road and flipping several times. The actor, who was not wearing his seatbelt, was thrown from the vehicle through the windshield. Several vertebrae in his neck and back were crushed. After he underwent surgery, fans were kept updated by the Facebook posts his mother gave regarding his condition. Eventually, his injuries proved impossible to overcome.


--DocBreak--
But trouble was brewing just beneath the surface. According to a report from _The Sun Chronicle,_ it was in 2007 that the actor landed in trouble following a brawl in New York City. Marston was accused of attacking three men and kicking at police officers during an incident at a Manhattan gas station. He was arrested and charged with four counts of second-degree assault, menacing, reckless endangerment, and resisting arrest. Shortly after the arrest his role on _One Life to Live_ was recast with Chris Stack. Ultimately, Marston struck a plea deal which allowed him to take part in anger-management sessions rather than spend time behind bars or on probation.

Of course, the real indication that Remembrance Day is upon us was the annual poppy-related dust-up. This year’s incarnation involved Whole Foods preventing employees from wearing poppies — and then changing course after a public outcry. Trudeau called it a “silly mistake,” and said something similar happens “every year almost.” Corridors fact-checked and can confirm this to be (more or less) true. Back in 2016, Air Canada made the exact same blunder — and the exact same hasty course correction. The following year, a Tim Hortons franchise found itself in hot water for selling poppy-shaped doughnuts with no plans to donate proceeds to veterans. And then there are the semi-regular stories about well-intentioned folks making hand-made poppies and the Royal Canadian Legion politely asking them to — ahem — stop.

HUNTSVILLE, Ala. (WAFF) - Over the past couple of weeks, WAFF has been spotlighting local businesses that opened their doors for the first time during a pandemic.This week, we spotlighted the owner of Southern Grace Medical Care, Mr. Jim Winn.After serving in the Marines and in the Huntsville Police Department for 25 years, Winn still had a dream to open his own family practice. The pandemic made things tough, but even with very few patients in the books, Winn officially made it happen on June 1.“It’s hard to start a family practice in the best of situations,” Winn said. "They say if you can survive the first two years you are going to be okay. Well surviving the first two years is tough when you are starting a business and you have no patients.From getting credentials, paying insurance, hiring staff and covering rent, Winn says there is not as much profit as you might think.“So I had to think of a different way to do things because there was no way in the world that I was going to be able to pay out all these things and still be able to keep things going with no patients coming in," Winn said.After months of planning, he found a way to make it work with Trinity Medical Center.“They needed another nurse practitioner, I needed a place to start my business," Winn said. "So we worked out an incubator deal where I use their staff and their facility and then I see a certain number of patients of theirs for free in exchange for that.”That partnership has been a success. Winn says he’s still able to control the number of patients he sees per day with the ultimate goal of avoiding conveyor belt medicine.“Like I said, I am retired, this is a second career so I was like, ‘If I want to do something right, I can do it myself.’ So I created Southern Grace so that I could see a limited amount of patients and make sure that I get plenty of time with each one of my patients."Winn’s practice also has a Direct Primary Care Program for people who don’t have healthcare insurance.“It’s a great payment plan where they basically pay Southern Grace 65$ per month and they get pretty much unlimited medical care here including basic labs,” Winn said. “It’s very beneficial to the patient but it’s also beneficial to me in keeping the business alive because it gave me another source of income to keep things going.”Despite all of the uncertainty, Winn has no regrets.“When I was in law enforcement it was very rewarding to me and I always told the people who worked for me that it was a privilege to be considered somebody who was a protector or somebody who takes care of other people,” Winn said. “So when I got out I just had this thing eating at me that I wanted to go into medicine because I love the rewarding aspect of having a career where you go home at the end of the day and you feel like maybe you made a positive difference in someone’s life.”Winn has one final piece of advice for anyone wanting to start a business right now, whether it be in the medical field or restaurant industry.He says you have to consider every possible expense and be 100 percent positive you’ll be able to meet those now and in the long run.Copyright 2020 WAFF.

Once whooping cranes arrive on their wintering grounds, many stay in the same general area. Younger birds, however, often haven’t paired yet and may wander a little off their usual flight path, using areas quite distant from the Aransas NWR area.
 Harrell says that due to the La Nina weather pattern forecast for this winter, the Southwest is in for a drier, warmer season, on top of the drought much of Texas is already experiencing. As such, freshwater wells on the Aransas NWR and surrounding areas will be very important for the whooping cranes upon their arrival. The USFWS is encouraging landowners to consider providing fresh water on their properties as well to aid the birds during their migration and wintering period.
 With sandhill crane and waterfowl hunting seasons opening and whooper migration in full swing, TPWD urges hunters to be extra vigilant. Whooping cranes are sometimes found in mixed flocks with sandhill cranes, which are gray and slightly smaller. With their all-white body plumage and black wingtips, whooping cranes may also resemble snow geese, which are much smaller and have faster wing beats. A video detailing the differences between snow geese and whooping cranes can be found on the TPWD YouTube Channel.
 There are several other non-game species that are similar in appearance such as wood storks, American white pelicans, great egrets and others, but a close look will reveal obvious differences. More information on look-alike species is available online.
 The public can help track whooping cranes by reporting sightings to TPWD’s Whooper Watch, a citizen-science based reporting system to track whooping crane migration and wintering locations throughout Texas. More information about Whooper Watch, including instructions for reporting sightings, can be found online and by downloading the iNaturalist mobile app. These observations help biologists identify new migration and wintering locations and their associated habitats.

The experience sparked his interest on the managerial side of things while developing his leadership skills - something that'll go on to define his career dream.

At the young age of 16, he started a modest printing company - printing bill books, visiting cards, college magazines, he even went door to door, making sales calls and bootstrapping. At the same time, he also co-founded the Leo Club of Malad East, Mumbai and went on to become its President 2 years later.

Il percorso che porta attivisti, deputati, senatori, consiglieri comunali e regionali del Movimento 5 Stelle a riunirsi il prossimo fine settimana di novembre in una assemblea pubblica, secondo le nuove regole di distanziamento sociale dovuto alla SARS-COV-2 prevedeva delle riunioni locali degli attivisti per la definizione, a livello provinciale, dei temi e delle proposte da dover poi sottoporre all'attenzione degli Stati Generali.
 A Latina e provincia i grillini hanno iniziato a discutere sui temi già da qualche mese. Nelle riunioni tenutesi tramite la rete, si sono approntati vari documenti ed idee che sono state portate a loro volta nelle riunioni regionali dove, si sono integrate con quelle di altri territori della regione per sintetizzare una posizione che tenesse conto delle proposte a maggioranza delle singole realtà provinciali.
 In quell'occasione, e per la prima volta nella pur breve storia del M5S, si è votato con altri metodi, senza l'ausilio della piattaforma Rousseau, per la selezione dei rappresentanti della società civile, e portavoce, che dovranno interagire in questo fine settimana nell'assemblea pubblica. Il protocollo prevede ancora da selezionare 30 iscritti al Movimento tramite votazione degli aventi diritto sulla piattaforma Rousseau. La votazione sarà attiva oggi dalle 12 e per 24 ore successive. La selezione di quest'ultimi candidati concluderà l' iter della schiera di attivisti che parteciperanno al dibattito.
 Il gruppo Latina M5S parteciperà agli incontri nazionali degli Stati Generali grazie alla presenza di Pasquale Palmisano, eletto rappresentante della provincia di Latina.
 "Mi preme evidenziare il carattere non verticistico della selezione che, osservando lo schema delle persone nei fogli diramati ieri, pone sulla sinistra gli attivisti senza nessun incarico politico e a seguire al centro deputati senatori e consiglieri comunali – afferma Palmisano - Questo sta proprio a indicare che ognuno è posto in una posizione paritetica rispetto a tutti gli altri e dove la società civile ha un posto fondamentale come è sempre stato all'interno del Movimento.Come si vede oggi Rousseau dà il suo contributo come strumento di selezione e aiuto alla parte politica del Movimento. La piattaforma è sempre più integrata nella vita politica e decisionale del M5S e si arricchisce di nuovi strumenti come ausilio alla formazione dei nuovi candidati".
 Il documento che é stato sintetizzato sabato scorso 7 novembre e formato da 3 macro sezioni:
 REGOLE E PRINCIPI, ORGANIZZAZIONE e AGENDA POLITICA.
 Non posso riportare tutte le idee/proposte che sono state valutate positivamente dagli attivisti che hanno voluto dare il loro contributo per il futuro del MoVimento. Ma posso fare qualche considerazione sulle proposte che più hanno trovato d'accordo i partecipanti.
 Mi riferisco principalmente all'organizzazione territoriale che trova tutti d'accordo nella certificazione del gruppo territoriale. Imprescindibile per una corretta azione politica sul territorio. Questo probabilmente sarà il tema maggiormente discusso.
 Molti vogliono regole certe e legittimazione dei gruppi territoriali, tante persone vogliono avere un punto di riferimento sul territorio a cui rivolgersi per qualsiasi informazione, scambi e servizi al cittadino.
 Per la certificazione delle liste si vorrebbe che fossero certificate non in concomitanza di elezioni amministrative, ma almeno con un adeguato lasso di tempo prima delle elezioni, con candidati selezionati dai territori e/o votati dagli aventi diritto sulla piattaforma digitale. Piattaforma che dovrà supportare i vari candidati con attività di supporto e formazione per le varie tipologie di candidature".

AUSTIN, Texas -- Texas has become the first U.S. state with more than 1 million confirmed coronavirus cases.
 The nation’s second-most populous state has recorded 1.01 million coronavirus cases and 19,337 deaths since the pandemic began in early March, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University.
 Texas registered 10,865 confirmed cases on Tuesday, setting a new daily record in a state led by Republican Gov. Greg Abbott. There are 6,170 people hospitalized with the coronavirus and 94 new deaths on Tuesday, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services.
 Texas had recently surpassed California, the most populous state, with the most cases. The true number of infections is likely higher because many people haven’t been tested, and studies suggest people can be infected and not feel sick.
 Another 1,292 cases and nine deaths were reported in El Paso County on Tuesday, bringing the death total to 682.
 Nationwide, there were 1 million coronavirus cases in the first 10 days of November.

Pepper noticed some opportunities where DeChambeau's distance will serve him well. "I walked the golf course with Bryson in mind today. And I looked at different places somebody who could carry the ball that far would hit it and places that they would cut corners. There is a gap in 13 that he could take it up high and left and take it into an area that's beyond the trees and pushing the 14th fairway. It can be done. The same thing at eight. He's going to have to shoot that ball in there a little bit. And at five. If he misses left in the bunkers -- they're pretty much pitch-out bunkers. But if he can carry it up there, in these conditions, there are definitely advantages. We need to be reminded that it's still getting the ball in the hole. And while he did it at Winged Foot, I think this is a little bit different animal we're looking at here at Augusta National."

People of Praise is a covenant community. Our covenant is not an oath or a vow, but is a commitment we make to one another to be there for each other in the long run, throughout life's seasons, its ups and downs. One can make that commitment only after several years of living community life and discerning over time if this is what God is calling you to do. Of course, it is possible that God later calls someone to a new work, in which case one is released from the covenant. But that is the exception.
