The guinea fowls which supposedly flew to Burkina Faso or Guinea the Guinea fowls’ hometown, is without gainsay, far better than the sudden disappearance of billions of cedis borrowed in the name of every Ghanaian into the bottomless pockets of political Mafias of Akufo Addo’s presidency. Such unprecedented daylight robbery of Ghanaians must certainly never be forgiven!

“It’s an unprecedented time, I think, in most of our lifetimes, and I would say the same about this position as being the director and trying to navigate the pandemic,” Anderson told The News-Gazette last week. “It’s been incredibly challenging.”
 As it presently stands, Anderson is overseeing golf, cross-country, girls’ tennis and girls’ swimming and diving seasons this fall.
 Among his next tasks is figuring out whether Gov. J.B. Pritzker and the Illinois Department of Public Health would be OK with the IHSA running its winter sports seasons of basketball, wrestling and boys’ swimming and diving.
 Another topic of concern is the IHSA trying to regain control of its “Return To Play” guidelines, a request Anderson made to Pritzker and Deputy Gov. Jesse Ruiz last month. The IHSA began deferring to Pritzker and the IDPH on all changes to those rules in July.
 And, of course, there’s also ongoing discussion surrounding traditional fall sports of football, volleyball and boys’ soccer, whose seasons are set to run from Feb. 15 through May 1 this school year. Not to mention any concerns regarding the new summer sports slate, which includes traditional spring events, set to go from April 19 through June 26.
 “We’ve tried to listen and to absorb the direction of leaders that we should — the governor’s office and the medical experts — and adhere to their guidance while still trying to navigate and do what’s best for our students that we serve,” Anderson said. “And, at the end of the day, that’s really our top priority.”
 Anderson admitted the 2020 fall sports schedule hasn’t played out exactly as he hoped. He believes football, volleyball and boys’ soccer could have transpired under certain restrictions, and the IHSA also wound up canceling all state tournaments for the fall sports that are currently competing.
 “We did get some fall sports back underway, though not to the level I think that we would’ve liked to see,” Anderson said. “In the foreseeable future, it looks like it’s going to continue to be (a challenge).”

Fellow Ghanaians, the jet-speed with which our cash has been devoured by this gargantuan government under the watch of President Akufo Addo is an eloquent testimony that, these boat-load of ministers and their ringleader, have not good intentions but most appalling sinister under their sleeves. Let them go with the money, their second agenda for which they are sharing their loot, from us to us must not see the light of the day in God’s name!

"The flu is a serious matter, and it can be prevented. Getting the flu can lead to complications with bad consequences, including intensive care and death, especially for people with cardiovascular disease. In fact, several studies have found that individuals with heart disease are 6 to 10 times more likely to have a heart attack following a bout of the flu," said Eduardo Sanchez, M.D., MPH, FAAFP, American Heart Association chief medical officer of prevention. "Flu vaccination should be part of routine medical care for all individuals but especially so for those with heart disease."
