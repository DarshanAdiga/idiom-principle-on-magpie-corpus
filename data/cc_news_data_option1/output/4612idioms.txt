It was a “unspeakably painful” act to accept defeat. Nationalists plundered government offices and harmed many senior politicians, including the prime minister who has been under strong pressure of almost all political parties to step down since the liberation of Susha on Nov. 8 by Azerbaijani forces. Apparently for many Armenians, Pashinyan – accused by Azerbaijan’s Aliyev of signing the cessation of hostilities protocol like “a mouse, hidden in a basement” – is public enemy number one for the time being. Things might change soon drastically. Change? How?

"Every weekend after workouts, you know it was offseason, after workouts I wanted to come home every weekend, but you know because it was a big jump for me because I was supposed to stay for the rest of my senior year in high school, but I transferred early.

And I started working on my football technique and everything else just came second nature so I'm not really sad about that nowadays I'm just chilling."

Thanksgiving is right around the corner, and for anyone wondering if it's safe to gather with friends and family amid the pandemic, there may be some good news. Emphasis on "some."By and large, health experts say it's best to stay home this year, especially with coronavirus cases surging nationwide.Updated safety guidelines published by the CDC on Monday note that small gatherings are "an important contributor" to the spike in infection rates. The agency recommends that older adults and others at heightened risk of severe illness avoid being around people outside their households.That said, if it is necessary to travel for the holiday, experts suggest gathering outdoors. They also advise planning ahead to reduce the risks associated with the virus. This includes quarantining for two weeks starting Thursday and getting tested for the disease with enough time to receive the results.A recent survey by the travel site Tripadvisor found that around 56% of people in the U.S. are planning to travel for Thanksgiving.

Trump’s policy towards China, to a certain extent was correct in holding China to international scrutiny in the South China Sea and in China’s sometimes unscrupulous trade and economic policies to foreign countries including the United States whose liberal trade policies the Chinese had been exploiting for several decades. His policy towards North Korea has been exploited by Kim Jong UN to become a nuclear power state. It will be realistic for Biden to follow Trump’s policy by accepting this reality. Whether this makes for world peace is another issue. This may lead to nuclear proliferation in Northeast Asia with Japan and South Korea feeling the need to become nuclear powers too. Perhaps with this eventuality of proliferation, may in the long run, be possible to have a comprehensive nuclear ban or disarmament regionally and globally.

On a general note, supporters of the Democratic Party are the more educated whites and suburban white women and minorities who listened to admonition from experts that it was safer to vote by mail in order to protect themselves by limiting physical contact with others because of the coronavirus pandemic. On the other hand, Trump dismissed scientific advice on the coronavirus and advised his supporters to only vote physically on Election Day. When the elections were held on November 3, for the election of the president and also to some gubernatorial positions at state level as well as some seats in state assemblies and to some seats in the House of Representatives and the Senate, the votes cast physically were the first to be counted. The mailed in votes and votes before the election were by law those that were counted last. The result was that the Republican candidates across the board had head start and some of them including the president were overtaken when all the mailed in votes were counted. This is not rocket science. President Trump in a premeditated plan, ran to the press when he saw the first tallies of votes that he had won a reelection. But this was not so and up till now he has refused to see what is obvious to every reasonable person that all votes both cast by mail, and those cast before the election and those cast during the election have to be counted to get the final tally and decide who has won and who has lost.
