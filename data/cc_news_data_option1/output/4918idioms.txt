Before I talk about Netflix's _Selena: The Series_, I need to come clean about something. I am extremely biased when it comes to Selena Quintanilla Perez. I believe the Tejano music star was a literal angel person sent to us from Heaven to bring joy, lift hearts, and teach us about the power of love. Her death was more than a tragedy. It is a martyrdom, and I'm shocked she hasn't been at least canonized yet.

_Selena: The Series_ takes its time showing viewers the ignoble struggles of the band, which is compelling in an almost disturbing way. While the film version of Selena's life story cast Edward James Olmos as a strict, but loving version of patriarch Abe, Chavira's version borders on abusive. We see the grown man shamefully push the responsibility of buying groceries with food stamps onto his teen children and he forces his teen son go dumpster diving for peach cans so they can build their own lighting rig. He works his kids to the bone in pursuit of his dreams for his family. When the rising stars finally secure a tour bus, it's a gut job without heat, A/C, or seats. He only buys a heater because Selena, the golden goose, is losing her voice.

Sometimes, only one person is missing, and the whole world seems depopulated.
 Alphonse de Lamartine, author The Thanksgiving Table (November 2020)
 I did it. But I wish I didn't have to.      I made a full Thanksgiving meal on my own. I roasted a turkey. Peeled a mountain of potatoes. Use the drippings to make gravy. Baked a pan full of dressing, green beans, dinner rolls, an apple crumb pie, plus loads of turkey- themed cookies. I even opened a can of cranberry sauce (it's okay, you can laugh at me). In all my 45 years of life, I've never done this before…never attempted to, never wanted to, and never needed to"but these are strange times that we're living in and strange times apparently demand complete turkey dinners on Thanksgiving…especially when your Mom is gone.
 The duality of living in today's pandemic is evident everywhere you go. In one day you can see groups of friends hanging out and carrying on without a care in the world and turn the corner to see fully masked families heading into the local grocery store. Our elderly suffer from isolation in their golden years and our healthcare workers are overwhelmed and stressed while millions of others continue to call COVID-19 a hoax to their faces. Daily, Americans walk through temperature checkpoints to get to school, work, or to travel while others plan block parties and the like. There are rallies and protests. I even read about some well-meaning parents who hosted a homecoming dance and now dozens of kids have tested positive. I'm not judging. My own family walks in this duality. We occasionally see local friends, we work outside our home, my kids go to the gym, play sports, and try to maintain normalcy all while walking this line with masks in hand. I jokingly remind them "it's COVID out there" and ask them to stay socially distanced as they head out the door. When they come home, I greet them and immediately send them to the sink to wash their hands. We're not perfect. At this point in the pandemic, we've all had moments where we've let our guard down and subsequently prayed that we don't pay the penalty. Strange times, indeed.
 Nine months in and I can no longer count the number of family members who have contracted COVID-19 on my fingers. I don't want to attempt to count the number of people in my circle who have had it and my heart breaks when I think about how the Coronavirus has affected my hometown in western Kansas. I have prayed for a number of individuals who have battled, struggled, and won. Praise God! And I have cried for those who weren't so fortunate. As I write this the death toll in the United States is 267,000+
 My mother is one of them.
 It's bizarre to grieve in a pandemic. The normal grieving process is both individual and communal, but when you can't see family members for fear of contracting or spreading a virus, the grieving process becomes even more peculiar. And when your lost loved one is a victim of that same pandemic, you proceed cautiously and carefully. Honestly, there are days where it feels like you're barely proceeding at all"like you're standing still while the world has moved on.
 You know the saying, "once bitten, twice shy?" Those are the eggshells that I walk on daily. I know how devastating and life-changing this virus can be. There are hundreds of thousands of people who should have been at the Thanksgiving table with their families this year, but they're not. Empty chairs, not just in my home, but everywhere. Traditions not just broken, but shattered. Those of us who have lost family members and friends to COVID-19 are experiencing this heartbreak over and over as the narrative has gone from "we're all in this together" to "there's nothing to see here, folks." And yet the pandemic and the loss of life go on.
 There are hundreds of thousands of people who should have been at the Thanksgiving table with their families this year, but they're not. Empty chairs, not just in my home, but everywhere. Traditions not just broken, but shattered.
 a Life Interrupted
 As we move into this unusual holiday season I can feel myself picking up the pieces of my broken heart non-stop. Normal Thanksgiving meant a road trip across the state with my kids. Normal Thanksgiving meant consulting with my mom, sister and sister-in-laws about what we would each contribute to the meal. Normal Thanksgiving meant hugs and seeing my nieces and nephews. Normal Thanksgiving is game nights, snacks and cousin sleepovers. Normal Thanksgiving is coffee with my best friend. Normal Thanksgiving meant going to my mom's house instead of making a complete Thanksgiving meal on my own.
 I did it. But I wish I didn't have to. In fact, I would have traded anything for it not to be the way that it is.
 It was the First Thanksgiving without my Mom and at every turn, we paired our grief with gratitude. I miss my mother so much. Today, I am even more thankful and grateful for her love and influence on my life. Often times I feel like my mother's memory lives in the kitchen which was so appropriate as I prepared the meal. And while she has been on my mind constantly, I felt like while I was missing her this Thanksgiving that she was somehow still mothering me…urging me to make the most of the holiday, not just for me, but for my kids. That's the kind of mother she was. Give, give, and give some more. Grieve, but be grateful. In the back of my mind, I kept hearing "keep the traditions." In my heart, her memory confirmed the feeling that forward is the best option, the only option.
 If you know me, you know I take tons of photos and videos. I document everything. (It's the reporter in me). As Thanksgiving approached this year and the memories started popping up on social media, my daughter said to me, "Mom, I'm so glad you take all the photos and the videos so we can see and hear each other. It makes me sad, but it also makes me happy. We laugh a lot." Taking photos and videos to share this Thanksgiving seemed extra important. And Casey is right, we do laugh a lot. In many ways, sharing photos and videos are the only way to be together while we continue to grieve miles apart.
 In the mix of photos I took this year, is this one of me at our Thanksgiving table just before the meal was served"and guess what, Mom? I didn't break the oven like I did that time I tried making strudel! I know you're proud…and maybe even a little bit relieved.
 I miss my mother and I miss my family so much, but we ALL did it. I wish we didn't have to, but we did it.

FAYETTEVILLE Unlike some angry that their opposition cites too many COVID-19 related absences to play a football game, (review Clemson Coach Dabo Swinney's lingering outrage two Saturdays ago when Florida State withdrew from its Clemson game on game day morning in Tallahassee, Fla.,) the Missouri Tigers ought to be grateful to Arkansas.
   
 Because the Razorbacks on Nov. 24 announced their healthy numbers were below SEC protocol to play last Saturday's game against Mizzou, the Tigers were free to make up their earlier season postponed game with winless Vanderbilt.
   
 Vandy suddenly also had open date last Saturday because scheduled opponent Tennessee was too stricken with positive COVID-19 tests and contract tracing related quarantines.
   
 So while the 3-5 Razorbacks rested their ill, Mizzou, now 4-3, rose above .500 well vanquishing Vandy, 41-0 at Faurot Field in Columbia, Mo. where they'll host Arkansas this Saturday.
   
 Arkansas was to host No. 1, 8-0, Alabama on Saturday at Reynolds Razorback Stadium but presumably will play that game on Dec. 12 here provided both teams are sufficiently healthy.
   
 Alabama uses this Saturday to make up its earlier postponed game against LSU.
   
 With last week's unaccustomed open date during Thanksgiving and needing more to restore his team's health than work his threadbare roster with hard practices, Arkansas Coach Sam Pittman gave his Razorbacks off after Wednesday's walkthrough and meetings through returning Sunday to launch Monday's game-week preparations and resumption of UA classes.
   
 "We're certainly hoping that we can get our players back by injury, by COVID, by quarantine," Pittman told media before last Wednesday's walkthrough. "We're very positive that we'll be able to play next week."
   
 Since Pittman was impressed with Mizzou and first-year Mizzou Coach and Alma native Eliah Drinkwitz last week, he presumably is all the more impressed after the Tigers skunked Vandy.
   
 "Missouri is very physical on both sides of the ball," Pittman said last week. "I really like (Mizzou defensive end) Tre Williams. I like their D-line. Nick Bolton is probably as good of a linebacker as there is in the SEC, probably in the country.
   
 (cornerback Ennis) Rakestraw and (safety Tyree) Gillespie and those guys in the back end are playing very physical football.
   
 Defensively, they run to the football. (Middle linebacker Devin) Nicholson had one heck of an interception to seal the game against South Carolina."
   
 Mizzou offensively?
   
 "They're very big and very physical on the offensive line," Pittman said. "They like to run the ball. Coach Drinkwitz does a great job of keeping your off balance . But if he can run the ball, he's going to turn around and hand if off, a lot like Tennessee did."
   
 Senior running back Larry Rountree, who seems like he's been on Mizzou's campus longer than its fabled Columns, has more career rushing yards, 3,398, than any Mizzou running back ever.
   
 "Rountree is a very, very solid, tough and physical runner," Pittman said. "(Connor) Bazelak is getting better each week. A young freshman quarterback. They've done a nice job with their transfer portal outside with their wide outs, junior college wise and transfer portal, they've got some nice wide outs as well. Very, very well coached and very good in special teams. Just a really, really good football team."
   
 A team that first-year Arkansas defensive coordinator Barry Odom left well- stocked from his 2016-2019 Mizzou head coaching tenure.
   
 Pittman, the Georgia offensive line coach from 2016-2019 debuting as Arkansas' head coach vs. Georgia in the 37-10 loss Sept. 26 in Fayetteville, was asked about Odom's feeling as a Mizzou grad and former Mizzou linebacker, defensive coordinator and head coach, returning to Columbia against his old school.
   
 "He played there, he's an alumni there, was a head football coach there and probably recruited a majority of the players that they have there," Pittman said. "I think he has a lot of love for his former players. At the same time, the University of Arkansas is paying him. He wants to do a great job for Arkansas. I'm sure there's a little bit of mixed feelings, just as I had playing against Georgia. But the bottom line is that Barry's a competitor and he will certainly have our football team ready to play."

 # Nina Gilfert's From the Porch Steps: 'Just Awearyin' for You...'
 Daily Commercial
 I woke up this morning with the words to an old song going through my head. “Just Awearyin' for You” is the title of an old song we used to play on our old Victrola when I was a kid back in the 30s and 40s. That Victrola is still in the basement of the 93-year-old house I grew up in back in Pennsylvania. That old thick record is probably still there also.
 I hate to say it but that sounds like a theme song for our present holiday season. Many of us will not be seeing family this Thanksgiving and Christmas. I am sure some of us will get up on a holiday morning and feel sad instead of experiencing the high that this season usually brings.
 Remembering Christmases past makes one sad and cheery at the same time; sad that we will not be seeing our loved ones as usual but cheered by the memories of past Christmases. Many of you, like myself, will be making alternative plans with friends who live nearby and can't spend the holidays with family who may have been exposed to the virus.
 Perhaps this is a good time to remember that the first Christmas was not about a joyful time of giving gifts and sitting around a groaning table of goodies with families. Perhaps we can remember the first and most remarkable gift and that birthday we are celebrating. This is a time for thanking God for our many blessings and concentrating on making a Christmas miracle for those in need. Let's make this a time for giving.
 The Salvation Army has always worked hard at this season saving souls and feeding and housing the poor. This year's kettle drive has been thwarted by the pandemic so they are floundering trying to meet all their clients needs.
 We all have our favorite charities and the Salvation Army is mine. My limited discretionary cash goes to one charity, hoping to do the most good possible. I was interested to discover that one of my friends does the opposite. She gives a small portion of her charity money to many different charities hoping to help more causes. However it pleases you to give, just remember there are a lot of good folks in need right now, many more than usual because of the pandemic and because of the weather patterns.
 This is a time to realize that missing family is a small price to pay when you consider those who have lost homes and businesses because of hurricanes and tornadoes and fires and those who have lost loved ones because of the weather and because of the virus. Remember when you read the statistics of homes lost due to the weather and lives lost due to the pandemic that there are real people behind those headlines and stats.
 Concentrate on staying safe this holiday season. We have a long way to go to defeat this terrible enemy and the best defense is our common sense. The experts say that social distancing and face masks are very important. Please be careful. The life you save may be yours or the life of someone you love. Use common sense and treat this like a temporary nuisance that will go away sooner or later depending upon our taking it seriously and listening to the experts.
 Next week this column will begin the first chapter of our annual children's Christmas story told in three chapters, appearing in this column. This is a brand new story for you to read over the phone or on Skype or whatever is at your hand. Read it to your missing grandchildren, letting them know it will continue each week until Christmas. This year's story is about Ginnis, the littlest elf in Santa's workshop. Maybe Ginnis' adventures will put a smile on your face.

(AP) - Stocks pulled back slightly from their record levels Monday as Wall Street put a quiet coda on one of its most rocking months in decades.The S&amp;P 500 fell 0.5%, but the benchmark index still clocked a surge of 10.8% for the month, its biggest monthly gain since April. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which has far less impact on 401(k) accounts than the S&amp;P 500 does, had its best month since 1987.The market’s slide followed reports showing how the worsening pandemic is dragging down the economy in the near term. But most investors are looking beyond that. The market’s strong November gains reflect Wall Street latching on to hopes that the economy will get closer to normal next year and strengthen in the long term. That scenario hinges largely on&nbsp;promising coronavirus vaccines&nbsp;being rolled out in coming weeks and, eventually, leading to fewer new virus cases, which have been increasing.“Today’s pullback in equities is a sidestep in a market that seems poised to trend higher,” said Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management. “We still think the market trends higher into the new year.”The S&amp;P 500 lost 16.72 points to 3,621.63. The Dow fell 271.73 points, or 0.9%, to 29,638.64. The Nasdaq composite slipped 7.11 points, or 0.1%, to 12,198.74. The S&amp;P 500 and Dow are close to their record levels, and the Dow crested the 30,000 level last week for the first time.Several big forces are behind this month’s surge, beginning with the clearing of some of the uncertainty that had dogged markets leading into the U.S. elections. Now, Democrat Joe Biden is firmly in place as the president-elect in Wall Street’s eyes, and investors have avoided their worst-case scenario of weeks or months of limbo with an unknown winner.Investors also found encouragement in prospects that Washington will remain under divided political control. Republicans are on track to hold onto control of the Senate if they can win one of two upcoming runoff elections in Georgia. A split government would mean low tax rates and other pro-business policies could remain the status quo.But the turbocharger for the market’s move higher has been a huge dose of hope as pharmaceutical companies come closer to delivering vaccines to a world beaten down by the COVID-19 pandemic. Several have reported encouraging data recently suggesting their vaccine candidates are highly effective.Moderna said it would ask U.S. and European regulators Monday to&nbsp;allow emergency use&nbsp;of its COVID-19 vaccine. Its shares jumped 20.2% Monday.Moderna follows Pfizer and German partner BioNTech in seeking to begin vaccinations in the U.S. in December. British regulators also are assessing the Pfizer shot and another from AstraZeneca.That’s helped the stock market’s rally broaden out. Early in Wall Street’s recovery this spring, it was Big Tech that almost singlehandedly carried the market higher on expectations that work-from-home and other trends would mean bigger profits for them. But hopes for a more widespread economic recovery are now boosting stocks of companies whose profits are more closely tied to the economy’s strength.Energy stocks in the S&amp;P 500 ended November with a nearly 27% gain. It’s a sharp turnaround from earlier this year, when oil prices plunged as the pandemic kept airplanes, trucks and factories around the world idled or slowed.Financial stocks have also been big winners on expectations that a stronger economy will create a stronger job market and higher interest rates. That could mean more people paying back loans made at more profitable rates for banks.Many of those stocks, though, gave back some of their big gains Monday following discouraging economic reports and as investors locked in some profits from their big recent gains. Apache lost 7.4% and American Airlines fell 2.7%.Likewise, the Russell 2000 index of smaller stocks, which closed out November with an 18.3% surge, fell 35.45 points, or 1.9%, to 1,819.82 Monday.Many of the gains in November were justified by the good news from vaccine development, but markets will likely see more churning ahead, said Katie Nixon, chief investment officer at Northern Trust Wealth Management.“You’ll see a diminishing impact from vaccine-related news and much more focus on when the economic recovery will take hold in a more organic way,” she said.A report on Monday morning showed that growth in business activity in the Chicago area slowed more than economists expected. A separate report said that the pace of&nbsp;pending sales of homes&nbsp;was slower in October than expected. They’re the latest data to suggest the resurgent pandemic is dragging on the economy, including a pickup in layoffs.With coronavirus counts and hospitalizations surging across the United States, Europe and elsewhere, governments are bringing back varying degrees of restrictions on businesses. An additional worry for markets is that the worsening pandemic will keep customers hunkered at home regardless of what kind of stay-at-home orders arrive. Experts are warning of a potentially brutal winter.IHS Markit&nbsp;jumped 7.4% for Monday’s biggest gain in the S&amp;P 500 after S&amp;P Global said it would buy the data provider in a deal valued at $44 billion, including $4.8 billion of debt. S&amp;P Global rose 3%.European and Asian markets ended broadly lower. The yield on the 10-year Treasury ticked up to 0.84% from 0.83% late Friday.___AP Business Writer Yuri Kageyama contributed.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Third-down and red-zone efficiency. It's the running theme for the season. The Jets went 3 for 13 on third downs against the Dolphins and rank last in the NFL in that category -- as they have for most of the year. New York actually showed some improvement in the red zone the last two games with Flacco at quarterback, but regressed with Darnold. The Jets went 0 for 3 on scoring touchdowns inside the 20 on Sunday.

It’s alarming the NFL is continuing to push forward. Their chief medical officer had said that as long as there was no evidence of ongoing transmission, the games would continue. But there is clear evidence of it, so I can’t understand why they’re continuing to press forward and I can’t understand why they’re putting the health and safety of their players at risk as well as the local community.”                                                                  The NFL has held things together remarkably well to this point, not needing to make the kinds of adjustments to the schedule that would add a week to the regular season. Given how close they are to the finish line, with just five weeks remaining before the playoffs, it’s understandable that the NFL wants to push as hard as it can to get there on time and not have to create a Week 18.                                                                   But the Ravens situation is clearly dire, with 21 players on the COVID-19 reserve list and an outbreak that clearly hasn’t been contained. And even if the tests had come back clean on Monday, experts in this field say that doesn’t mean the team has the virus under control. In order to do that, you’d need to have a lot of people go into the CDC-recommended quarantine period of 14 days rather than just rely on one day of testing.                                                                  “You’d hope there would be an inclination to comply with public health recommendations and model good behavior because the rest of the country is watching,” said Jennifer Nuzzo, a Senior Scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security and associate professor of epidemiology. “My worry is they feel like using testing will guarantee safety of the players who test negative that day, but we’ve seen in other circumstances the folly of a test-only approach. They provide information but they don’t ensure safety and sometimes that information is wrong.”                                                                  Justin Lessler, also an associate professor of epidemiology at Johns Hopkins, said if an outbreak of the magnitude the Ravens are dealing with occurred at a different type of business — say, a restaurant or bar — the state would “almost certainly step in and shut it down.” But he also acknowledged that at this point, the health risk is mostly from team to team and not as much the general public health interest.                                                                   But that could be a problem for the NFL, too.                                                                   “Certainly from the perspective of avoiding transmission, it’s not the best idea (to play),” Lessler said. “I think that they have very close contact and are breathing very hard so if anyone is infected there’s ample opportunity for spread in this situation. I do think, though, it’s more a lot of this is driven by the virus being widespread in the community and the NFL isn’t doing any sort of bubble or anything like that to try to really protect the players, and as long as you do that it’s very hard to keep the virus out of that community.”                                                                  In all of his public comments when teams have positive tests, NFL chief medical officer Dr. Allen Sills has said that games will be played when there’s no longer evidence of ongoing transmission within a team. But what troubles Grabowski is that in the Ravens’ situation, one day of negative tests does not establish that evidence when you’ve had that many infections and nine straight days of at least one person testing positive.                                                                   “It just makes no sense," she said. "Even from a financial perspective I can’t see how ultimately having huge outbreaks among two of the NFL’s best teams is good for anybody in the long run. So I think it makes sense to contain outbreaks and the NFL needs to think about doing something different. What they’re doing to prevent transmission isn’t working, and they should probably re-evaluate their plans. I think they need to do a deep dive into where things are going wrong.”                                                                  And it’s only going to get harder given the nationwide trends and the light at the end of the tunnel coming into view for many players, particularly those on teams that aren’t going to make the playoffs, who have had to be extremely careful for months and months about where they go and who they are around.                                                                   But the Ravens situation is particularly problematic given the large number of people affected and the clear evidence that they haven’t broken the chain of transmission. We all know why the NFL wants them to play on Wednesday. It’s just as obvious, though, that they shouldn’t.                                                                   About Us Newsroom Staff Ethical Principles Corrections Press Releases Accessibility Sitemap Terms of Service Your California Privacy Rights/Privacy Policy Privacy PolicyDo Not Sell My Info/Cookie Policy                                                                  Contact Us Help Center My Account Give Feedback Get Home Delivery eNewspaper USA TODAY Shop Licensing & Reprints Advertise Careers Internships Support Local Business                                                                  News Tips Podcasts Newsletters Mobile Apps Facebook Twitter Instagram LinkedIn Pinterest YouTube Reddit Flipboard RSS                                                                  10Best Reviewed Jobs Moonlighting Sports Weekly Studio Gannett Classifieds                                                                  The City The Wall Storytellers                                                                  © 2020 USA TODAY, a division of Gannett Satellite Information Network, LLC.

Hello and welcome to the December edition of Pro Tips with Capt. Jonathan Moss. We have found what so many of us have been looking for: the end of 2020. It has been a crazy year for all of us with it’s fair share of ups and downs. Like most of you, I started the year very busy with work and was blessed to be guiding six days a week. By March, Covid-19 was in full swing and my charters began to slow down. For me and my family, slowing down a bit was much needed as we had a two-month-old baby boy at home and I was starving for some quality family time. What none of us knew at the time was how long things would be slow. With that being said, as we approach the holiday season, let me encourage you to buy local and buy from small businesses. Those who own and operate these companies are a part of our community. Consider hiring a guide or gifting a charter to a family member or friend. It will be an experience to remember and I’m sure you’ll walk away with some newly acquired fishing knowledge!

 Ver Hage said about 60% of the ship would likely need to be replaced to have it fully restored, including the flight deck, mast and many levels directly below the flight deck.
 The ship will likely be decommissioned in San Diego. Crew members will be notified of reassignment.
 The Bonhomme Richard was nearing the end of a two-year upgrade estimated to cost $250 million when the fire started.
 About 160 sailors and officers were on board when the flames sent up a huge plume of dark smoke from the 840-foot (256-meter) amphibious assault vessel, which had been docked at Naval Base San Diego while undergoing the upgrade.
 Firefighters attacked the flames inside the ship while firefighting vessels with water cannons directed streams of seawater into the ship and helicopters made water drops.
 More than 60 sailors and civilians were treated for minor injuries, heat exhaustion and smoke inhalation.

Thanksgiving has come and gone, and the Christmas season is in full swing. Parents with children in tow are searching for a Christmas tree, eager to bring holiday cheer into their homes. After finding the perfect tree comes the challenge of safely transporting it back home.
 In order to keep spirits high, and everyone on the roadway safe, AAA is reminding drivers this holiday season to properly secure and transport their real Christmas trees so everyone can safely enjoy the holidays.
 Previous research from AAA found road debris, which includes objects like improperly secured Christmas trees that fly off of cars, caused more than 200,000 crashes during a four-year period and resulted in approximately 39,000 injuries and 500 deaths across the United States. With the number of COVID-19 cases still on the rise, and hospitals already spread thin, it is important everyone take care to avoid needlessly adding to those numbers with preventable accidents and injuries.
