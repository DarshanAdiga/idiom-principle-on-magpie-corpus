At 34, David Price may not quite seem like a superstar trade, but the five- time All-Star is likely to slot into the Dodgers' starting rotation behind Walker Buehler and Clayton Kershaw. There is a consensus among Dodgers fans that the team have benefitted from the original three-team Mookie Betts trade deal falling apart. The revised two-team trade deal will see Brusdar Graterol serve as a back-end closer for the Dodgers. Graterol was earlier slated to head to the Boston Red Sox. His medical records over a Tommy John surgery, however, threw a spanner in the works.

To simplify everything, Belarus is furious that Russia is allegedly ripping it off and supposedly treating it as a "junior partner" instead of a full-fledged equal one. Hammering home the point, President Lukashenko can't believe that his partner wants to sell him resources at a higher price than the West pays. He's apparently afraid that the systemic shock caused by paying such higher prices could crush his economy, even endangering Belarus' stability, but he still thinks that a solution might be agreed to during the "moment of truth" slated for this Friday. All told, the words that came straight from President Lukashenko's own lips vindicate what the author has been warning about for nearly the past five years already concerning the underlying distrust in Russian-Belarusian relations, leading him to wonder why his writings weren't taken seriously.

With Steve Nash, the Mavericks also acquired their star player - Drik Nowitzki. Both of them together led the Mavericks to four straight NBA postseasons but were unable to secure a title due to untimely injuries. Nash then moved back to the Phoenix Suns, where he came close to the title for consecutive years, but once again could not even make the NBA finals. During this time, Nash won his first MVP award in 2005, as he led the team to the Western Conference finals against his former team - the Mavericks. However, even though the Suns were a great team comprising of Shawn Marion, Amar'e Stoudemire and coach Mike D'Antoni, Nash lost back-to-back playoffs due to injuries and also questionable decisions made by the NBA officials. According to _ESPN_ , during the 2007 playoffs, Boris Diaw and Stoudemire were suspended for a game after the Suns-Spurs scuffle which put a damper on them winning the NBA title. Nash also broke his nose during the 2010 Western Conference finals, which added to the Suns losing their shot at the title.

London [UK], Feb 10 (ANI): South Africa coach Mark Boucher is all praise for skipper Quinton de Kock as he said that the wicket-keeper batsman has got a 'very smart cricketing brain'.   "We always knew that Quinny has got a very smart cricketing brain. He had a couple of different field placings which I thought were good and he was thinking out of the box," ESPN Cricinfo quoted Boucher as saying.   Boucher also stated that De Kock enjoys being in the game and leads well.   "Quinny enjoys being in the game. Sometimes he sits in the dressing room during Test-match cricket and he gets really irritated because he wants to be doing something all the time," Boucher said.   "I think he really enjoys it. The off-the-field stuff is the stuff that might get to him a bit. We're going to have to help him in that regard. But certainly, on the field, he leads well," he added.   South Africa faced a two-wicket defeat in the third ODI against England on Sunday and with this victory, the visitors managed to end the three-match series at 1-1.   Although admitting that Faf du Plessis is 'still one of our best T20 players', Boucher stressed that the player needs a bit of a break away from the game.   "Faf is still one of our best T20 players. We feel at this point in time he needs a bit of a break away from the game. It's always good to have a bit of a rest. There is going to be a lot of cricket for them leading up to a World Cup so any opportunity we get to give guys a bit of rest and give other guys opportunities to see what they're all about," he said.   South Africa and England will now compete against each other in a three-match T20I series, starting from February 12. (ANI)

Considering all that's been covered in this analysis thus far, it's obvious enough that President Lukashenko was correct in describing his upcoming meeting with President Putin on Friday as "the moment of truth" in bilateral relations, one which will lead to a new era in their partnership one way or the other. It seems as though the Belarusian leader is giving his Russian counterpart a "final chance" to submit to his demands for what he considers to be "fair and equitable relations" across all spheres, especially concerning energy and commercial trade, thus carrying the optics of an "ultimatum". The most positive outcome would be if Presidents Lukashenko and Putin reach a "pragmatic" and all-encompassing "compromise" with one another to reboot their bilateral relations and put the past scandalous year behind them, maturely undertaking the necessary steps to allay their counterpart's suspicions and restore their partnership back to its previously "unshakeable" strategic level. For as mutually beneficial of an outcome as that would be, it's unclear exactly how likely it is to happen given that President Lukashenko might have already made his mind up to "balance" ("gradually pivot") away from Russia, seeking only to reiterate that he will not "flexibly compromise" on his "final demand" ("ultimatum") so as to then have the "publicly plausible" pretense for this new policy if President Putin refuses.

The officer in the driver's seat was hit in the neck and chin area, narrowly missing the carotid artery, Shea said. The officers were able to drive off, and the suspect fled the scene.
 After the first shooting, the official said Williams left and visited family members before going to the 41st precinct office and opening fire, a law enforcement official told CNN.
 A video posted on social media shows the incident and was also confirmed by a senior NYPD official.
 In Sunday morning's incident, the suspect walked into the precinct and immediately pulled out a gun and fired multiple rounds toward the desk area where several uniformed members were present, Shea said. The suspect then walked into an area beside the desk and fired several more rounds at uniformed service members and a civilian, but those shots hit no one, he said.
 Shea said the suspect was then taken into custody and the firearm, a 9 mm Sig Sauer, was secured by police. The incident was captured on video from within the precinct station house.
 Shea said this weekend's attacks reminded him of the 2014 murders of officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu as they sat in their patrol car. In both situations, he said, the attacks came not long after public protests against police practices in the city. Protests against the policing of subway fare evasion January 31 led to the arrests of 13 people, CNN affiliate WCBS reported.
 "Just remember these things are not unrelated," he said. "We have people marching in New York City last week and I condemned it and I condemn it right here again today -- using profanities against the Police Department.
 "Everyone should be speaking out against this, and you have to be careful about the words you use, whether it's on social media or on written papers or speaking, because words matter and words affect people's behavior."

Tauranga [New Zealand], Feb 10 (ANI): As New Zealand have already sealed the three-match ODI series against India, pacer Tim Southee expressed happiness over his team's performance and said their ODI games have been great.   "It is always great to play India. Obviously the T20 series did not go according to plan but the one-day games have been great. The one-day side played some great cricket for a while although we are missing a couple of guys," Southee said in the pre-match press conference here on Monday.   New Zealand secured a four-wicket win in the first ODI and defeated India by 22 runs in the second ODI to seal the series. However, India had white-washed New Zealand in the five-match T20I series before the ODI series.   Southee stressed that although they have won the series, it will be nice to win the third ODI as well.   "We will do what we do and results will take care of itself but winning is always nice. We want to keep playing the way we have been playing and it is nice to win the series already but to win another game, it is always nice," he said.   Ish Sodhi, who missed the second ODI, said it will be fantastic if he gets a chance to play in the third ODI.   "It is a fantastic opportunity if I get a chance to come and play. The series has already been won and it is fantastic," he said.   The third ODI between New Zealand and India will be played on Tuesday. (ANI)

Russia watchers are anxiously awaiting the outcome of Belarusian President Lukashenko's meeting on Friday with his Russian counterpart after the former dramatically declared earlier this week that "the moment of truth has come" for bilateral relations following his country's rapidly improving relations with the US simultaneously with its worsening ties with institutional "ally" Russia. The "fellow" CIS, CSTO, and Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) partners have generally enjoyed excellent relations since the dissolution of the USSR, driven to a large degree by Belarus' economic dependence on Russia's generous energy subsidies for most of this period and the West's disgust of the landlocked country for supposedly being "the last dictatorship in Europe" due to its form of "national democracy" centered almost entirely on President Lukashenko. This state of affairs, which was largely taken for granted by most observers, is quickly changing, however, as a result of two concurrent trends -- Belarus' "balancing" act with the West and Russia's relinquishment of its aforementioned subsidies, both of which are linked to one another in a "chicken and egg" way wherein it's difficult to tell which is responsible for which.
