An oceanographer and environmental engineer in Mauritius, Vassen Kauppaymuthoo, told the BBC that local residents were now "breathing heavy vapours of oil", and there was a "mixture of sadness and anger" over the spill. Police in Mauritius said they have been granted a search warrant, allowing them to board the vessel to take away items of interest such as the ship's log book in order to help with an investigation. The ship's captain will assist officers with their search.

 # Alex Okelo, a Pearl-Cohn three-star defensive end, commits to Michigan State
 Tom Kreager
 Nashville Tennessean
 It was a decision made in a virtual world.
 But it was one in which Pearl-Cohn three-star defensive end Alex Okelo felt confident. Okelo committed to Michigan State on Sunday, picking the Spartans over Indiana.
 "Even though I didn't get to take a visit up there physically, I did take a virtual visit," said Okelo, the No. 26 college football prospect in Tennessee in the 247Sports Composite for the Class of 2021. "Everything on the virtual visit was amazing.
 "Everyone showed a lot of interest. They kept great communication."
 Okelo said the only campuses he had been to before the coronavirus pandemic had been Kentucky and Tennessee, which also had made him an offer.
 Okelo said he has stayed in close communication with Michigan State defensive line coach Ron Burton during his recruitment.
 "We communicate almost every day or every other day," said Okelo, a 6-foot-5, 217-pound two-sport athlete who had 36 tackles and seven sacks in 2019. "I have great communication with him and a lot of the other coaches."
 Okelo is Michigan State's 12th commitment for the Class of 2021 and second defensive end in the class, joining Tyson Watson of Warren Mott in Michigan. He is the fourth-highest prospect of the current class.

 Okelo is the second member of the Firebirds to commit to an FBS school. Teammate Kyndrich Breedlove, a cornerback, has committed to Ole Miss. Teammate William Parker, an offensive tackle and No. 12 prospect in the state, will make his school choice on Sept. 4.
 Pearl-Cohn is one of several schools in the state that have postponed the start of their 2020 football seasons. While the state begins the season on Thursday, the Firebirds will not play their first game until Sept. 11 at the earliest after Nashville Metro schools' decision to push back the start of sports for the 2020-21 school year.
