Mainstream Democrats often invoke “loyalty” as the quality they hope to inspire in their voters. But “loyalty” is a two-way street: party leaders shouldn’t expect it if they can’t deliver for the voters who put them in office.

He spearheaded the 1994 crime bill, for instance, which expanded mass incarceration and hurt Black communities across the country.

"And when your time is up then it is your job to put the country first and think beyond your own ego, and your own interests, and your own disappointments," Obama said. "My advice to President Trump is, if you want at this late stage in the game to be remembered as somebody who put country first, it's time for you to do the same thing."
 Obama also criticized those Republicans going along with Trump's false claims of widespread voter fraud.
 "I'm more troubled by the fact that other Republican officials who clearly know better are going along with this, are humoring him in this fashion. It is one more step in delegitimizing not just the incoming Biden administration, but democracy generally. And that's a dangerous path," he said.
 In recent days, Trump appeared to be inching closer to acknowledging the reality of his loss. In comments Friday in the Rose Garden about a coronavirus vaccine, Trump said his administration would "not be going to a lockdown" to slow the spread of COVID-19, and added that "whatever happens in the future, who knows which administration it will be? I guess time will tell."
 Trump on Sunday renewed his groundless attacks on an election technology firm, Dominion Voting Systems, without evidence of any serious irregularities. Dominion has said it "denies claims about any vote switching or alleged software issues with our voting systems."
 The Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency, a federal agency that oversees U.S. election security, said in a statement last week that the "November 3rd election was the most secure in American history." The agency said, "There is no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes, or was in any way compromised."
 John Bolton, a former Trump national security adviser, said it was important for Republican Party leaders to explain to voters that Trump did lose and that his claims of election fraud are baseless. Bolton left the administration last year. He says he resigned; Trump says he fired Bolton.
 "I think as every day goes by, it's clearer and clearer there isn't any evidence. But if the Republican voters are only hearing Donald Trump's misrepresentations, it's not surprising that they believe it," Bolton said on ABC's "This Week." "It's critical for other Republican leaders to stand up and explain what actually happened. Donald Trump lost what by any evidence we have so far was a free and fair election."
 Having none of that was Rudy Giuliani, the president's personal attorney who is helping lead Trump's national legal front on the election challenge. In a television appearance that Trump previewed on Twitter after his morning tweets, Giuliani denied Trump was conceding -- "No, no, no, far from it."
 "I guess,'' Giuliani told Fox News Channel's "Sunday Morning Futures," "you would call it sarcastic."

Can we trust election results?
 Mark Levin and Sydney Powell, both noted constitutional lawyers, stated on TV that changes to election rules, not approved by state legislatures, are probably unconstitutional. Some opined GOP state legislatures were somehow responsible for the voting travesty. State election boards are run by the executive branch, not legislatures, whose role is to pass laws. Governors and mayors administer laws, not make them – including election laws.
 Swing states have Republican-controlled legislatures, which choose the Electoral College. Could those legislatures refute tainted election results and instruct electors to vote for Trump? Would it be legal?

Colleges and higher education institutes in Karnataka, which are set to reopen from Tuesday, have been scrambling to ensure that they meet all the coronavirus disease (Covid-19)-related safety protocols prescribed by the government. The colleges, which have been closed for the last eight months, have been instructed that beside an extensive sanitisation drive across the board, students, staff and teachers should compulsorily carry Covid-19 negative reports, which are less than 72 hours old before reopening these institutions. The attendees need to compulsorily wear masks, use hand sanitisers and take other precautions in a bid to contain the spread of SARS- CoV-2, which causes Covid-19.Students have been given the option of attending classes online or in person. All students seeking to attend classes in person need to get a letter of consent from their parents or guardians. Also read | No lockdown in Delhi even as Covid-19 cases go up, says Delhi health minister Satyendar JainThe laboratories have been forced to pool swab samples because a large number of students, staff and lecturers want Covid-19 negative reports, which are less than 72 hours old. "A sudden spike in demand for Covid-19 tests of those wanting to attend colleges and higher education institutes coupled with the ongoing Diwali holidays has put an enormous pressure on the system because of an acute staff crunch," said a state health department official requesting anonymitySome of the private laboratories have expressed their dissatisfaction because of an inordinate delay in receiving pending payments for tests. "I don't want to jeopardise our chances of receiving pending payments. However, we won't process swab samples sent by the state government unless our dues are cleared," said the manager of a private laboratory, who did not want to be identified. However, the official claimed that the "sums involved are small and will be paid in due course and no laboratory can refuse to conduct tests as the government can take legal action".The government will also reopen hostels for higher secondary students that are run by the social welfare department for backward classes and minorities. All undergraduate, engineering and diploma colleges will reopen in the state from Tuesday. Similarly, all medical, nursing and Ayush (Ayurveda, yoga & naturopathy, unani, siddha and homoeopathy) colleges will reopen from December 1.Dr CN Ashwath Narayan, deputy chief minister, Karnataka, who is also in charge of higher education, had announced on Friday that pending dues of guest lecturers for the last five months would be paid at the earliest.

Planting a church, let alone hosting services, is no easy task during the novel coronavirus pandemic.
 Since the virus hit Cape Ann and the North Shore in March, all churches and synagogues have had to rethink the way that they connect with their congregantions and the community at large.
 Union Congregational Church in Magnolia has been alternating between online and outside — socially distant — services. North Shore Bible Church of Cape Ann went in-person back in May when Gov. Charlie Baker lift his order closing places of worship. Others — such as First Congregational Church of Rockport and Temple Avahat Achim in Gloucester — have chosen to stay remote for the immediate future.
 While what church looks like differs from place to place, one thing is for certain: it is not the same as it once was.
 With all the uncertainty, Aten has no intention of going against the grain.
 “We really want to be respectful of the COVID regulations,” Aten said, explaining that Freedom Church will not launch its services until a year out of living in the city.
 “Unless there is a vaccine, it becomes a little difficult to launch something new,” he added. “We are going to try, but we are also not going to do anything crazy right now.”
 While he waits for the rate of COVID-19 cases to go down, Aten’s focus is getting a pulse of what is happening seaside. “We are going to start by connecting with the community and leveraging technology,” Aten explained. “If COVID settles down and we have an opportunity to do something then obviously we will do something. But we want to be responsible with COVID, that is our biggest thing right now."
 "The last thing the city needs is a new church trying to get a hundred people in a small space," he said.
 Aten sees the temporary hold on services as a blessing as it provides him and his team more time to get to know local people and where their skills might be best used to serve.
 “As soon as we get here we want to start serving the community, whatever that looks like for us” Aten said, who plans to move his family to Cape Ann in December or January. “I am not going to act like I am an expert on Gloucester right now and know all the needs. I am still learning.”
 “We are just so excited to move back,” Aten said. “We will see what happens.”

I am both proud and humbled by the efforts Muslim communities have shown in light of this pandemic, and what they have been able to achieve in the face of uncertainty. We have truly showcased our capabilities to support one another during something that has been isolating for so many people and have offered hope when it has often been hard to find. “While our communities have delivered great acts of service the past few months, there is still much work to be done, and I look forward to witnessing what we can achieve looking ahead with more collaborative and coordinated efforts.”

The US surpassed 11 million coronavirus infections over the weekend, and states are rushing to set up restrictions as hospitalizations grow. Just six days ago, there were 10 million cases nationwide. Health experts are calling the pandemic a "humanitarian" crisis and pleading with President Trump to allow transition talks between his health officials and aides of President- elect Joe Biden. The incoming White House chief of staff said their team has not talked to current top health officials about the pandemic because of Trump's refusal to trigger ascertainment — the formal process of opening a transition to a new administration. Instead, Biden's team is getting up to speed on the pandemic response by back-channeling with governors, members of the private sector and the medical community.

A sonobuoy deploys upon impacting the water surface, though, special purpose sonobuoys may operate on task-specific programming. An inflatable component floats on the surface of the water transmitting radio signal for communication with ships and aircrafts, while a stabilizing and hydrophone sensing device descends beneath the surface to a measured depth depending on variables such as search patterns and environmental conditions. The instrument imparts acoustic signals using its hydrophone component via VHF/UHF wireless technology to operators on board ships and aircrafts. The hydrophones also known as transducers converts the sound waves into electrical signals in order to send them to nearby patrolling warships. There are three types of sonobuoy systems used for warfare and non-ware operation — special purpose sonobuoy, passive sonobuoy, and active sonobuoy. It has been noticed that the demand for passive sonobuoy is relatively higher than the other two.

From what we've seen so far, you'll save the most money by going directly to your cellular carrier — retailers like Walmart and Best Buy are running some just-OK deals, but Verizon, AT&T, and T-Mobile easily one-up them with their own stellar offers for trade-ins and/or new line activations. Also, note that unlocked iPhones are few and far between — we couldn't find any on sale aside from the iPhone 8, which came out all the way back in 2017.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President-elect Joe Biden’s scientific advisers plan to meet with vaccine makers in coming days even as a stalled presidential transition keeps them out of the loop on government plans to inoculate all Americans against COVID-19. Biden chief of staff Ron Klain says President Donald Trump’s refusal to accept that he lost the election means that the Biden team lacks a clear picture of the groundwork within the government for a mass vaccination campaign that will last the better part of next year. The nation's preeminent infectious disease expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci, says it would be better if government scientists could start working with the Biden team.
