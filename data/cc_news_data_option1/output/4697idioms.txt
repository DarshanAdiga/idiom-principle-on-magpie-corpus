Soon after launch, the production became plagued by  problems. Several crew members dropped out within a few days. Los Angeles-based cameraman Pedro Gonzalez said he was looking forward to what was supposed to be a three-month trip across the country but  couldn’t stay with the project in light of the disorganization.                            Fellow cameraman Phillip Darlington lasted about a week, though he calls that time — during which he witnessed a Thai restaurant owner in L.A. feed a desperate contestant — a “spiritual experience.” His final straw came during a run-in with a California Highway Patrol officer who stopped  contestants and crew along a highway in Newhall, Calif. According to Darlington, the patrol officer told him that with trucks speeding around the blind curve where the racers were plodding along, “we’ll be picking up your bodies for weeks.”                            “And that got under my skin because … he’s right,” Darlington said, adding that there was  no medic — a resource he was accustomed to on a professional set. The run-in is depicted in the second episode. In it, contestant Tiffany Gil, a college student from Huntington Beach, looks at the camera and says they’re being shut down because the production “is inhumane.”

Saints will play a weaker Catalans team without Mcllorum and Tomkins in it. Leeds played against a full 13 players for 80 minutes when in hindsight that should have been just 12 or maybe even 11.
 So for me it’s bravery with a referee and help via a video referee who sees replays after quick on-field actions that sometimes can and do go missed.
 Saints are the beneficiaries on this occasion, as the semi-final against Catalans is on paper at least a little easier with the loss of a couple of big and influential players for the Dragons.

Driving day in and day out, with plans constantly changing, isn’t for the faint of heart, he said: “They want to keep their pride. They’re supposed to be experienced, so ... they played that card.”                             A contract signed by contestants and obtained by The Times includes a nondisclosure agreement. A first violation of the agreement results in a $20,000 penalty, a second $50,000 and a third $100,000. The contract states that contestants who leave the show before crossing the finish line owe the producers $100,000, with limited exceptions. It also  limits the producers’  liability for injuries. __                            “People shouldn’t be allowed to sign these kinds of contracts,” Los Angeles-based entertainment attorney Bryan Freedman said after looking it over. “It’s kind of like signing a contract that says I can kill myself. It doesn’t comply with the law. These reality TV stars and reality TV people, for the most part, need to be protected against themselves.”                             Oliver said that he felt the contract was fair and that contestants signed on with eyes wide open.                            “If you participate in such kind of TV shows, you have to accept the risk that goes with it,” Oliver said. “We take our responsibility, and we make sure everyone is safe, but when someone has a day off and decides to do something on his own, you cannot be responsible for it. We cannot sleep with them, and be on their back constantly, to see what they do.”

FAYETTEVILLE, N.C. (AP) — Authorities in North Carolina say that a man has been arrested on charges of attempted murder and rape nearly 30 years after police say the crimes were committed. The Raleigh News & Observer reported Monday that two other suspects are still at large. Fayetteville police said they've arrested Roy Junior Proctor, 46, after its cold case unit linked him to the crime using DNA. Police said they matched a sample taken from him in September to the DNA from the victim’s 1992 rape kit. Proctor is in Cumberland County Detention Center with bail set at $1 million. It's unclear if he's hired an attorney. “This case stands as a reminder... the law enforcement community will not rest until we get justice,” said Cumberland County District Attorney Billy West. Lt. Michael Petty said at the news conference that investigators have looked into the attack, “time and time again, trying to find something that we missed.” The victim was walking to her car after cleaning some offices when she was knocked unconscious, thrown into a trunk, driven out to a wooded area, Petty said. She was then raped, beaten, and left to die. Petty said that connecting Proctor to the crime “is the highlight of my career.\"

BOONE — The coronavirus pandemic is making everything look a lot different this year and that includes the High Country Turkey Trot 5K. The annual Thanksgiving Day event, benefitting Hospitality House of Northwest N.C., has been taking place on the Boone Greenway Trail since 2011. This year, its 10th anniversary, the High Country Turkey Trot will take place virtually, for an entire week, with contests across multiple social media platforms.                                    Hospitality House has dubbed Nov. 19-26, High Country Turkey Trot Week with contests, sponsored by Mast General Store and The Winkler Organization, taking place on Facebook, Instagram and TikTok with prize packages totaling $1,000.                                    “The most magical thing about the Turkey Trot is the feeling of community and camaraderie among people from all across the United States gathered at the Boone Greenway each Thanksgiving morning,” said Hospitality House director of development Todd Carter. “While that’s not possible this year, our hope is that people will connect and compete in our contests and still have some fun. We all need as much fun as possible this year.”                                    The highest dollar value prizes to be won during Turkey Trot Week will be in the Peer-2-Peer Fundraising Contest. The top three people who raise the most money greater than $250 by Nov. 27 will win gift cards and prizes from Mast General Store, Pepper’s Restaurant and Bar, Footsloggers Outdoor and Mountain Running Company. The first place fundraiser will win $250, second place $175 and third place $100 in gift cards and prizes.                                    For the avid runner, there is a 5K race on Facebook. Runners wishing to compete can run the race anytime during Turkey Trot Week and post a photo with their timed result via Garmin, Connect, FitBit, Apple Watch or other timing device, to the Facebook event page by midnight on Nov. 26. Winners will be announced on Saturday, Nov. 28. Winner certificates, $20 Stick Boy Bread Company gift cards and $25 Mast General Store gift cards will be sent to the top three overall men's and women's finishers, with additional winner certificates being awarded in 10-year age divisions.                                    For those looking to cut loose, there is a TikTok Turkey Dance Challenge to the song Banana (feat. Shaggy) by Reggae artist Conkarah, and an Instagram Costume Contest with the top two participants receiving the most likes and shares on each platform winning a $25 Mountain Running Company gift card and $25 Amazon gift card.                                    Registration and contest information can be found online at _HCTurkeyTrot.org_.                                    General registration is available for $25. Bib registration is available for $30 and includes a 10th anniversary souvenir race-bib. T-shirt registration is available for $40 and includes a long-sleeve 10th anniversary souvenir t-shirt. Deluxe registration is available for $45 and includes both the souvenir race-bib and t-shirt. All registration levels are for both adults and children with t-shirt sizes available in youth medium and adult small, medium, large, extra-large and xx-large.                                    Everyone who registers will receive a 15 percent discount coupon from Mast General Store. T-shirts and race bibs are available to local residents for drive-thru pickup on Nov. 18 from 10 a.m.-noon, and Nov 19 from 3 p.m.-5 p.m. in the Publix at Three Creeks parking lot, 1620 Blowing Rock Road, Boone.                                    Registrations for souvenir t-shirts and souvenir race bibs will continue throughout the month or until sold out. Registrants from out of the area will continue to have their t-shirts and race bibs shipped in a timely manner.                                    Since 2011, the High Country Turkey Trot has raised more than $230,000 and close to 10,000 pounds of food to support the mission of Hospitality House of Northwest North Carolina, a regional homeless services agency providing housing, hunger relief and crisis assistance in seven counties.                                    Those not wanting to walk, jog, roll, run or race are encouraged to visit _HCTurkeyTrot.org_ and make a general donation to help Hospitality House meet the increased demand brought on by COVID-19.                                    “I want to make it clear that running is not required,” said Carter. “The funds from this event are critical to supporting our Winter Seasonal Shelter, which began on November first. This year looks like no year ever before and we need extra support, from runners and non-runners alike, to meet the challenges that lie ahead.”                                    The High Country Turkey Trot hopes to be back on the Greenway Trail for Thanksgiving 2021 with a ten-plus-one celebration and proper 5K race.                                    This year’s event is sponsored by Stallings & Co. Designs, Molecular Toxicology Inc., Skyline/Skybest, The Winkler Organization, Knights of Columbus Council #11966, OP Smiles, Wren’s Nest Landscaping & Garden Center, Bridgeman Dentistry, David Patrick Moses Architect, Valle Crucis Conference Center, Mast General Store, Omega Tees & Screen Printing, Stick Boy Bread Company and Ray’s Weather Center.

Slot machines have become popular long before the emergence of online casinos. There were times when the player just had to go to the slot machine, throw a coin into it, and pull the lever. This triggered a mechanism that spun the drum and produced some combination. More often than not, it certainly didn't bring anything to the player. Nevertheless, there were exceptions when players could win a decent amount of money almost out of the blue.

Democrats Claim They Want ‘Unity’ But Keep Calling Me A Nazi
 _After spending 20 years claiming that Al Gore won in 2000, four years claiming that Hillary Clinton won in 2016, and two years claiming that Stacey Abrams is the actual governor of Georgia, leftist media continued to reject basic reality when they unanimously declared that Joe Biden, on his third attempt, is now president-elect of the United States.
 The facts that the Trump campaign is actively challenging some results, and that recounts are scheduled to occur, or that the media are not endowed with the ultimate authority to erase electoral procedure with their enthusiastic projections, to them are irrelevant details.
 On the back of this media-endorsed “victory,” Biden took to the stage and delivered what the left are describing as a “call for unity.”_

Though apparently dozens of women have recently gone missing along the Montana highway, good college-bound girls Danielle and Grace break the pattern of anonymous prostitutes as victims, and are therefore the ones to trigger any real alarm. (This differentiation, unfortunately, is one of the most realistic aspects of "Big Sky" by a long shot.) In the first two episodes, the series mostly splits its time between the detectives piecing together various evidence and Danielle, Grace and fellow kidnapping victim Jerrie (Jesse James Keitel) trying desperately to understand what's going on before it's too late.

                                    There are over 1,000 volunteer fire departments across the state of Illinois, and many of them dot the rural towns across Central Illinois, including in the Canton area. Within each of those departments are brave hometown heroes, who regularly drop everything to help a neighbor in crisis.                                    However, if my 20-plus years in the fire service have taught me anything, it's that sometimes firefighters don't feel there is room for that image of a courageous firefighter to co-exist with someone reaching out for mental health help.                                    Sadly, this misperception has led to far too many firefighters to take their own lives after bottling up all of the stress from the job inside for too long. In fact, firefighters are more likely to die by suicide than in the line of duty.                                    Responding to a cardiac arrest, fatal fire or car wreck can be traumatic, but answering those calls can be particularly difficult for volunteer firefighters in small towns because they likely know someone involved. To make matters worse, many times these firefighters don't go back to the firehouse and debrief after a tough call. Instead, they return home to their families where they refrain from discussing the difficult things they've witnessed, and instead, suppress their emotions in unhealthy ways.                                    Many first responders also have a fixer mentality - since they focus on fixing problems and helping people in their communities, it might seem burdensome to admit they have problems of their own. It might be difficult for them to explain to friends or family what they are going through out of fear that others might not understand.                                    It's time to turn the tide when it comes to the mental health crisis among volunteer firefighters in Central Illinois. How do we begin? By ending the stigma connected to mental health in our volunteer firehouses, taking the time to debrief tough calls together and making firefighters aware of the mental health resources available to them.                                    One of those mental health resources is Illinois Firefighter Peer Support, which I have been involved with for three years as the Central Illinois Coordinator. Illinois Firefighter Peer Support is a 450-firefighter-strong network of trained, peer supporters providing career and volunteer first responders with a safe, non-judgmental and confidential environment where they can engage in a healing conversation. It's a trusted place for first responders to get help from someone who has likely been on traumatic calls themselves and really understands the unique pressures of the job.                                    In addition to matching first responders to peer supporters, ILFFPS helps fire departments conduct debriefing sessions after tough calls and can connect those suffering from emotional trauma with mental health professionals specialized in the needs of first responders.                                    Protecting our communities begins with first protecting ourselves, and that includes mental health and well-being. I urge all firefighters in our region, including volunteers, who need help to contact the ILFFPS Peer Support Hotline at 855-90-SUPPORT or email ILFFPS at Ilffps1@gmail.com.

As a former life-long Republican I am sad to say that today's Republican politicians, and Senate Leader McConnell in particular, have been short- sighted dinosaurs who will doom the party to minority status if they do not soon come to terms with some obvious realities.
 I recently heard this prophetic phrase "Demographics is Destiny." Admittedly this is a hard concept for us to grasp here in mostly white Montana, but we need to realize that America's racial and ethnic mix is changing rapidly. The Republican base of older white voters will soon die off, and those remaining will be outnumbered by younger, more progressive white and non-white voters. So, the handwriting is on the wall for our country. Will Republicans see it? Will they react to it in constructive ways? Here are some of the realities they will face:

The acromion is part of the shoulder blade and forms a roof over the top of the shoulder under which the rotator cuff tendons course. The rotator cuff tendons when pinched between the ball and roof become painful and further perpetuate the condition. Impingement syndrome can also be caused by repetitive motion such as throwing. Repetitive overhead throwing such as in baseball is a common cause of impingement syndrome and results from the repetitive scuffing of the tendons underneath the acromion bone of the shoulder blade. The tendon sheath and tendon are very susceptible to compression and with repetitive throwing, the tendon can become inflamed, thickened and more likely to become impinged.

In one incident that eerily parallels “The Straight Story,” contestant Stephen Zampieri in mid-August found himself hurtling down a steep embankment on a lawnmower after it suddenly kicked into gear outside his hotel in Dodge City, Kan.                             Without a means to steer or stop, and a truck looming in the too-near future, Zampieri, a 41-year-old ex-Marine living in Arvada, Colo., leaped off and rolled away from the vehicle, which soon crashed into a car. A good Samaritan rushed to his aid and drove him to the lone hospital in Dodge City. And unlike Straight, who lands just fine, Zampieri fractured his left wrist and was rushed into surgery.

“Are you celebrating?” The Uber driver’s question took me a little off-guard. And then he may have gotten an earful from me. He was talking about the election. And my answer was “no.” There is nothing to celebrate when New York City was boarded up for election night, with the threat of violence looming on the chance that Donald Trump would win reelection.                                     There were literal fires election week around Washington Square Park. I watched one viral video of a woman spitting in the face of a police officer simply trying to keep the peace. I’m grateful for when police are around, because people are being crazy. I’ve never gotten so yelled at in my life as I have in recent weeks in Manhattan. People are on edge. Election week included helicopters hovering overhead late into the night, a buzzing sound that wouldn’t quit. Of course, then there is all the noise we willingly subject ourselves to. What if we all just turned off the endless angry rhetoric of cable news for a while, for the sakes of our hearts and minds?                                    And so now we will have the second Catholic president. That’s a tragedy and a scandal. The second Catholic president, representing a party that has the most radical abortion agenda, with the one legit pro-life Democrat, Rep. Dan Lipinski, leaving, having been primaried out of his seat by the abortion lobby. And let’s not get into the vice president-elect’s views on Catholicism.                                    And I don’t even know if I blame Joe Biden for this mess. He’s certainly had more than his fair share of suffering in his life. He wouldn’t be the only Catholic who has not read the catechism of the Catholic church. We have a long tradition here in the United States of, as Harvard professor and former ambassador to the Holy See Mary Ann Glendon has put it, Catholics being either chameleons or turtles. We blend in with the culture or we hide, hoping no one notices us. That’s not the Christian call, however. We need to be showing people that we are Christian by our love. The measure of our lives is love. By the way we are living our lives today, would anyone know it?

COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — A former chairman of the Ohio Republican Party who is charged in a $60 million federal bribery scheme has denied wrongdoing in an interview and is asking for dismissal of a lawsuit to stop collection of money to pay for related subsidies. “I did not break the law,” lobbyist Matt Borges, who served as party chair from 2013 to 2017, told The Cincinnati Enquirer for a story Monday. “I did not conspire to break the law. I did not intend to break the law. I was not aware of anyone else breaking the law if it was happening.” Borges pleaded not guilty in August to a charge of racketeering following a July indictment. The government accused Borges and four others of shepherding $60 million in energy company money for personal and political use in exchange for passing the bailout of two aging nuclear plants and then derailing an attempt to place a rejection of the bailout on the ballot. Borges' attorney asked a Franklin County judge Monday to dismiss a lawsuit filed by Republican Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost that seeks to stop money from being collected from nearly all Ohio electric ratepayers beginning in January to pay for the nuclear plant subsidies. Yost's lawsuit also wants the criminal defendants banned from lobbying or participating in campaigns. Two of the five defendants, Juan Cespedes and Jeffrey Longstreth, pleaded guilty last month.
