As temporary shutdowns at meatpacking plants across the nation rise and large chain grocery stores limit meat purchases, small-town meat processing plants and markets gain new customers.
   
 At the beginning of this year, a two-month wait to have a cow or hog slaughtered would have been the norm. Now, many small processing plants in Kansas are booked through the beginning of 2021.
   
 "It's insane," said Cassey Shupe, one of the owners of Holton Meat Processing in Holton. "It's brought out the best in people. It's brought out the worst in people."
   
 More and more ranchers are bringing their animals in for slaughter -- some for the first time. As the nation's large processing plants are slowing down production lines because of protective processes for workers, they are in need of fewer animals. Some ranchers are turning to small operations for help.
   
 In addition, the large uptick in locally raised beef and hog sales direct from the ranch to their consumers has also increased, causing the longer wait for slaughter.
   
 "It's nuts," said Jeff Krehbiels, the owner of Krehbiels Specialty Meats in McPherson. "Our sales (in the retail store) are up by 200%."
   
 Krehbiels, like Holton Meat, is booked through 2021, but like Holton Meat, its shelves remain full. Although Holton Meat is not limiting meat, pork or poultry, Krehbiels and Jackson Meat in Hutchinson have placed a few restrictions on specialty cuts.
   
 "We're setting a small restriction so everybody has a fair chance at getting the product," said Drew Bryan, the owner of Jackson Meat, which does not butcher, but sells beef, pork, chicken and bison cuts. "We've definitely seen an increase in retail customer sales."
   
 Ranchers are also feeling the crunch. If they can't get their animals to slaughter quickly enough, they can't sell their meat directly to the consumer and they will have to keep feeding the animals, creating an extra expense.
   
 Julia Strnad, of Strnad Land & Cattle in Wellington, has had increased calls for her Charolais beef. She hopes she can get enough slots at the processing plant she uses, Stroot Lockers in Mulvane.
   
 As of Thursday, White's Foodliner, a Kansas grocery chain, which has stores in Kingman, Medicine Lodge, Phillipsburg, Scott City and St. John, is not yet feeling the pinch. But the grocery chain is taking precautions.
   
 "We've limited sales to three chicken, three beef and three pork products," said Steve Witty, manager of the Kingman Foodliner. "We don't want it to get like the toilet paper thing where people from Hutchinson and Wichita drive out to get our products."
   
 Witty feels confident that taking these precautions will help his customers continue to have the meat products they need.
   
 Hy-Vee, Dillons Food Stores and Costco Wholesale have all temporarily limited the amount of meat customers may purchase.
   
 "There is plenty of protein in the supply chain; however, some processors are experiencing challenges," said Sheila Lowrie, a spokesperson for Dillons Food Stores. "At this time, we've added temporary purchase limits on fresh ground beef, poultry and pork to ensure all customers continue to have access to these products."
   
 Holton's Meat, Krehbiel's Specialty Meat and Jackson Meat are seeing all their products -- from briskets to bacon to chopped meat -- get purchased at the same rate.
   
 "It's an eye opener to the public to know where everything (meat and poultry) comes from," Shupe said. "It's not made in the grocery store."

The helicopter’s blade will be highly advanced as it will be able to rotate ten times more than the blade of the helicopters on the Earth, to be precise about 3000 rpm. This is very much necessary to remain aloft within the Red Plant’s thin atmosphere. The altitude at which the helicopters on Earth fly is around 40,000 feet above the ground level. However since the atmospheric layer of Mars is merely one percent of that of the Earth, so when the helicopter is hovering around Mars atmosphere, it is equivalent to 100,000. The scientists have told that they had to study a lot of parameters before building up such a helicopter. Keeping in mind the thin atmosphere of the Red Planet, the aircraft was built as light as possible. At the same time, the strength of the helicopter was also taken care of to sustain the harsh weather of the Red Planet.

China is open to an independent investigation to determine the origins of the coronavirus now sweeping the world, its ambassador to Berlin told a German magazine on Friday, amid U.S. allegations that it came from a laboratory.
 China has dismissed as groundless U.S. and Australian questioning of how it had handled the coronavirus pandemic, saying it had been open and transparent, despite growing scepticism about the accuracy of its official death toll.
 "We are open to an international investigation," Wu Ken told Der Spiegel magazine in an interview. "We support the exchange of research among scientists.
 "...But we reject putting China in the dock without evidence, assuming its guilt and then trying to search for evidence through a so-called international investigation."
   
   
 Australia has called for an international investigation into the origins and spread of the virus that emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year.
 U.S. President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo say there is evidence it originated in a Wuhan laboratory, without saying what the evidence is. A German intelligence report cast doubts on their accusation.
 Some 3.86 million people have been reported to be infected around the world and 268,620 have died, according to Reuters tally.
 Responding to Australia's efforts to establish support for an international inquiry, France and Britain have said their focus is fighting the virus, not apportioning blame.
 Trump has been fiercely critical of China and the World Health Organization and has announced the United States will withdraw funding from the U.N. agency.
 Many scientists and politicians say now is the time to increase, not cut, funding to the WHO so that it can help find a vaccine.

Britain's Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden warned on Friday that the Premier League does not yet have the "green light" to resume but restated the government's hope that the season can be completed. Premier League clubs are due to meet on Monday to discuss the latest plans for "Project Restart" \-- a day after an expected minor easing of coronavirus lockdown measures. Clubs are understood to have been told that the use of a limited number of neutral venues is the only way to complete the campaign, to limit the strain on essential services and discourage gatherings of supporters near stadiums. But those at risk of relegation argue that the integrity of the competition would be compromised by the neutral-venue plan. Brighton chief executive Paul Barber is opposed to the idea, with the Seagulls hovering two points above the drop zone. Brighton were scheduled to play five of their remaining nine games at home. Despite extensive contingency planning, Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Oliver Dowden warned the Premier League was yet to get the go-ahead, with testing and player welfare major hurdles. "They've not been given the green light," Dowden told BBC Radio on Friday. "If we can get a plan that works then I'd like us to be able to go ahead with it because I think it would be good for the nation, it would be good for football as a whole. "I'm really hopeful we can get this up and running but public safety must come first so it's only if we're confident of that, we'll be able to proceed." In Germany, the Bundesliga announced this week that it would resume matches on May 16, behind closed doors and subject to extensive coronavirus testing. Dowden's comments came as The Times newspaper reported that Football Association chiefs would block any attempt to declare the Premier League season null and void and abandon relegation.Relegation scrapped?At least one club reportedly wants relegation to be scrapped if neutral grounds are used. But The Times said it was understood that the FA board supported the Premier League board's position that the league table should be decided on sporting merit even if it were cut short. Former Manchester United and England defender Rio Ferdinand said there was no viable resolution that would satisfy all 20 clubs. "People are going to feel at a disadvantage if certain decisions are made but I don't think the Premier League can have a wholehearted 100 percent win on this no matter what decision they make, which is unfortunate," he told the Press Association. Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero and Brighton's Glenn Murray have raised objections from a safety point of view but Ferdinand said they should put their faith in the authorities. "The Premier League, the FA and the government, if all of those three bodies give it the green light then I'm sure the players' protection, health and well-being will be at the top of their agenda to make sure they remain healthy and not at risk," he said.

In a time when so many places are closed, and we can't get to our favorite places for vacation or a day out, many parks remain open, giving us an opportunity to get outdoors.      One of those parks that offers a great spring experience is Letchworth State Park in Castile, New York. Known as the Grand Canyon of the East, this park offers plenty of room to distance yourself from others, get exercise and fresh air -- it's an area to escape and relax.      Letchworth offers magnificent views of the Genesee River, which flows through a canyon surrounded by the towering walls. Three waterfalls add to the beautiful scenery. Forests surround the park, and visitors will find 66 miles of hiking trails. The park also offers trails for horseback riding and biking.      Winding park roads follow along the canyon and offer plenty of places to pull off to take in the scenic views. If you want to see the view from a higher vantage point, a hot air balloon ride is the way to do so.      Dozens of waterfalls are in the park. Three of the larger falls are easily accessible and are named Lower Falls, Middle Falls and Upper Falls. Middle and Upper Falls are the most accessible, close to the parking lot and a short walk along wide trails. Lower Falls is worth the short hike to view it.      Lower Falls is located right below Glen Iris Inn, the former home of businessman William Pryor Letchworth, who gifted the property to the state.      The park was established in 1907. Glen Iris sat on 1,000 acres. Over the years, Letchworth opened much of the property to visitors, including a museum. The museum continues to follow the history of Letchworth today.      Fishing, hunting, swimming and picnicking opportunities are abundant. Or just sit in a comfy chair enjoying the outdoors and watching nature go by.      If you are seeking spectacular views of fall foliage, the first two weeks of October is the prime time to visit. If winter is your thing, there is plenty to do -- snow tubing, ice skating, snowmobiling, cross-country skiing or enjoying a horse-drawn carriage ride.      Camp or rent a cabin and explore the park, or venture out to see what the surrounding area has to offer -- first making sure to confirm what's open. Spend a day at Niagara Falls or wander the shop-lined streets of nearby Ellicottville, a small town that is home to Holiday Valley Ski Resort. The resort offers many summer fun things to do as well. Do a little "wineing" in New York's Finger Lakes wine region, and don't miss the Grape Discovery Center in Westfield (grapediscoverycenter.com), reopening once New York's state of emergency has lifted.      Niagara Falls and the city of Salamanca offer casino resorts -- Seneca Niagara and Seneca Allegany. The beautiful city of Buffalo is about 60 miles from the park and offers many things to do, from extensive gardens and sailboat rides to touring Navy ships, world-class restaurants, arts, sports and Seneca Buffalo Creek Casino.      Whatever your definition of fun is, you might just find it at Letchworth State Park and the surrounding areas. Fun and beauty are right on your doorstep when camping or lodging at the Glen Iris Inn in the park.      For more information on the specifics for hunting, fishing, rafting, balloon rides, cabin rental, camping and park rules, visit parks.ny.gov/parks/letchworth or call 585-493-3600.      At this time visit the website to make sure the park continues to remain open and what activities are available. Whether you go now to enjoy time outdoors, take a beautiful drive or wait until a later time when everything is open again, the park won't disappoint.      Letchworth is a "carry in, carry out" park. Whatever you bring into the park, including your picnic trash, you take out of the park. There are no garbage containers.

Berlin. Die Anzahl der Auswechslungen im Fußball wird durch die Corona-Krise vorübergehend von drei auf fünf erhöht. Der International Football Association Board (Ifab) hat den Antrag des Weltverbandes FIFA bewilligt.
 "Diese sofortige vorübergehende Änderung wurde eingeführt, da ein dicht gedrängter Kalender und Spiele bei mitunter großer Hitze drohen, was sich beides auf das Wohl der Spieler auswirken könnte", hieß es in Mitteilungen der FIFA und des Ifab, das über grundlegende Regeländerungen im Weltfußball zu entscheiden hat.
 Das neue Wechselkontingent gilt zunächst nur für Wettbewerbe, die zum 31. Dezember 2020 abgeschlossen sein werden, unabhängig davon, ob sie bereits begonnen haben. Die Deutsche Fußball Liga kann die neue Regelung für die erste und zweite Bundesliga auch übernehmen, wenn die aktuelle Saison am 16. Mai fortgesetzt wird. Darüber solle kurzfristig entschieden werden, hatte DFL- Geschäftsführer Christian Seifert am Donnerstag bereits gesagt.
 Ifab und FIFA wollen zu einem späteren Zeitpunkt entscheiden, ob die veränderte Fassung von Regel 3 auch auf Wettbewerbe ausgeweitet werden sollte, die erst 2021 abgeschlossen werden. Das hieße, dass auch in der nächsten Saison noch fünfmal gewechselt werden dürfte. Durchgeführt werden dürfen die Wechsel in der Pause und bei weiteren drei Gelegenheiten.

Measuring the Impact: Demand for Semi-hard & Hard Cheese Product Augmented by Global Outbreak of COVID-266


--DocBreak--
Globalization as a process has led to abuses typically associated with unfettered capitalism. To be sustainable, capitalism has always needed a minimum set of rules, with the emphasis on "minimum." America, arguably the most capitalist country in the world, has antitrust laws, antidumping laws, laws protecting labor, even minimum wages. Within the US, everybody is expected to play by those rules.
 However, problems arise in an open global system, when different countries with different rules and different goals try to operate together. Less scrupulous capitalists and governments have indeed been able to get around pesky regulations, even using them to their advantage. The World Trade Organization, the supposed referee, has unfortunately utterly failed to keep harmony.
 Take outsourcing, for example. Western companies moved production to China _en masse_ to take advantage of very flexible and cheap labor. Three hundred of the world’s top five hundred companies have facilities in Wuhan alone*. By producing in China, the virtuous Europeans, for example, avoided their own burdensome social laws. In contrast to their home markets, overseas production bases have no high wages, no social taxes and no restrictions on lay-offs. This workaround is reminiscent of the old system of indulgences where one could sin, but pay a priest money and still go to heaven. In its modern version, one can exploit workers (in China) and still be virtuous.
 It is not just European companies, of course. All nationalities’ manufacturers occasionally look the other way when convenient. Too often, Western companies do not want to know what the suppliers of the suppliers are doing.
 Consumers in the West loved globalization too. Cheap goods imported from low- cost countries kept feeding our addiction to consumption. It is astonishing how we let this play out to such an extreme. Our dependency on imports, especially from China, is now so deep-rooted that it is becoming a threat to our survival as a free society.

DHAKA,Bangladesh (AP) — More than 250 Rohingya Muslim refugees who had been floating for weeks on a fishing boat in the Bay of Bengal arrived Friday on an island in southern Bangladesh, officials said. The refugees were brought to Bhasan Char island after they reached elsewhere on Bangladesh’s coast, said Mohammed Alamgir Hossain, police superintendent in Noakhali district where the island is located. He did not say who brought them there. Louise Donovan, a spokeswoman for the UN refugee agency, told The Associated Press that they received reports that approximately 280 Rohingya were being brought to the island by Bangladesh's Navy. “We are seeking further information from the Bangladesh authorities,” she said. Another group of 29 Rohingya refugees reached the island on Sunday after weeks of floating at sea and failing to reach Malaysia. Rights groups said recently that hundreds of Rohingya are stranded on at least two fishing trawlers between Bangladesh and Malaysia. The refugees reportedly attempted to reach Malaysia, but failed because of strict patrols to keep out the coronavirus. Currently more than 1 million Rohingya refugees living in Bangladesh in crowded camps in Cox’s Bazar district. Most of those Rohingya their homes in neighboring Myanmar after the military launched a counterinsurgency campaign in response to an attack by a Rohingya insurgent group. Security forces were accused of committing mass rapes, killings and burning thousands of homes.

 Life goes on.
 You have probably heard that dozens of times as friends, family members and maybe even complete strangers try to encourage you in times of sadness.
 In the moment, no one wants to hear that.
 I know I didn't in August 2010 when my mom, Sandy, died.
 It is hard to believe this coming August marks a decade of life that has gone on since she went to be with her Lord in heaven. This year also marks the 10th Mother's Day holiday that I and my siblings have not been able to express our appreciation face to face with the woman who gave us birth and committed decades of her life raising up three children she prayed (I heard her doing this daily) would be followers of Jesus and did what was right.
 I could tell you stories in the lives of my brother and sister when they did not live up to mom's goals, and I know there were times when I would have tattled on them, but the reality is while I was pointing one finger at each of them, the rest of them would be pointing right back at me.
 I sure wish Mom was still around for Mother's Day. I really miss her a lot.
 I know I am not alone in that, either.
 My mom taught me so many lessons, not only with her words but through the way she lived her life. Mom was committed to her faith and her family. Those were always her priorities.
 Mom taught me the importance of respecting life and to respect those who are older than me. To this day I have a hard time calling people who are older than me by their first name. (Just typing her name above was something hard for me to do, because there was no way I would have ever called her that.)
 My mom helped develop my love for reading. I saw her reading all of the time, and so I knew that it was something to not only do as a way to learn but it could be something to enjoy. (The unhealthy collecting of books is something I developed all on my own.)
 Reading and studying the Bible was her priority. Mom loved to hold what were known as Friendship Bible Coffee studies. The irony in that is I don't ever remember my mom drinking coffee.
 During my growing up years I always knew Mom would be there for me. When I got home from school she was always there. I frankly do not remember an afternoon when I would walk into our house when she was not waiting for us. I also recall that she seemed glad to see me when I got home - even if my room still needed to be cleaned.
 I learned from my mom that liver, kidney beans and squash are gross. My mom was a great cook and made plenty of great meals in my life. Yet, there are times when even the most creative of people face uphill battles when working with inferior products.
 Most importantly, she, and my dad, taught me to love Jesus. I always knew where they stood on this - not only in what they said but also how they lived their lives.
 If I were to list all of the things I learned from my mom you would still be reading it when another decade of Mother's Day holidays would have passed.
 I know I did not tell her enough how much I appreciated her and what she did for me. She was sacrificial, loving, caring, faithful and so many more things.
 This Sunday is Mother's Day. Even though this year might mean you can't be with your mom because of current health circumstances, know that there have not been any instances where coronavirus has been spread by phone.
 Also, dads, remember because the kids are not in school this year, there won't be any gifts coming home. You are on your own. The good news is there is still time to get something done.
 To all of you who are called Mom by someone (even at times when it seems you have heard it a million times in the past hour) I want to offer a heartfelt thanks.
 Thank you for being a great example for your children and for helping to develop generations of successful people who will carry the baton into the future.
 Happy Mother's Day.

Two former Democratic presidential hopefuls and a Senate colleague have an aggressive new proposal to expand direct financial assistance to Americans during the coronavirus pandemic.
 Sens. Kamala Harris, Bernie Sanders and Edward J. Markey are joining in draft legislation that was reviewed ahead of official release by CQ Roll Call that would provide $2,000 per month to all Americans, including children and others of those claimed as dependents.
 Sanders, a Vermont independent and two-time presidential candidate who caucuses with the Democrats, said in an advance statement that the economic crisis brought on by coronavirus-related closures will require far more than the one-time $1,200 checks provided to many Americans already.
 “During this unprecedented crisis, Congress has a responsibility to make sure that every working-class household in America receives a $2,000 emergency payment a month for each family member. I am proud to be introducing legislation with Senator Harris to do exactly that,” Sanders said. “If we can bail out large corporations, we can make sure that everyone in this country has enough income to pay for the basic necessities of life.”
 “Bills will continue to come in every single month during the pandemic and so should help from government. The Monthly Economic Crisis Support Act will ensure families have the resources they need to make ends meet. I am eager to continue working with Sens. Sanders and Markey as we push to pass this bill immediately,” added Harris, a onetime rival to Sanders for the Democratic nomination for president.
 Markey also highlighted the significance of recurring payments for workers in the gig economy. Many of those workers may be attempting to access the expanded unemployment insurance provided in a recent coronavirus response law.
 Proposals similar to the one being announced Friday by Harris, Markey and Sanders are circulating.
 In the House, Democratic Reps. Madeleine Dean of Pennsylvania and Don Beyer of Virginia have written to Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy on the same topic. In a letter dated Tuesday, they sought a $2,000 payment in the next round of assistance, with provisions for additional payments to be made at least once a quarter if circumstances warrant.
 “So many Americans need help right now, and Congress must not fail them. This is not a time to hold back — leaving people at the mercy of this crisis would be immoral and would hurt, not help, the broader economy,” Beyer said in a statement. “We saw quickly that the first round of direct payments needed improvements and we should make them rapidly and get assistance to those who need it, especially the millions worried about making their rent payments or buying food."
 The House members were following on an earlier letter along the same lines from 18 Senate Democratic Caucus members to Senate leaders seeking more robust payments.

Twelve students from the class of 2020 at Minuteman Regional Vocational Technical High School were recently recognized as Outstanding Seniors including Nicholas Moy and Benjamin Tangora, of Concord.
 The seniors were treated to a luncheon with Minuteman administrators in the school's student-run restaurant, The District Cafe, shortly before the coronavirus emergency closed schools in March.
 "Minuteman is a place where we foster students' strengths so they can excel in their education and as leaders for those around them," said Edward A. Bouquillon, superintendent director of Minuteman. "The coronavirus has put a damper on the events we typically hold to honor our seniors at the end of the year. But we want all our students, especially our Outstanding Seniors, to know that we are very proud of them."
 Each year, teachers and staff nominate seniors for separate, annual statewide awards for seniors from the Massachusetts Association of Vocational Administrators and the Massachusetts Vocational Association.
 Nominated students must have a minimum 3.5 GPA, display technical competence in their career major, exhibit leadership qualities, vocational-related work experience, excellent class attendance, extra-curricular activities and community service involvement.
 "All of these students demonstrated a determination to learn, leadership and a desire to improve their school and communities," said Principal George Clement. "They are all wonderful role models and deserve to be recognized more than ever."
 Moy, a robotics major, is described as an eager problem-solver whose contributions help the students and teachers around him. For his senior project, Moy upgraded the hardware of the technology used in Minuteman's robotics program to help students compete in the national SkillsUSA competition. He is in the school's game club and is an avid biker and outdoors person. He completed a three-week camping and biking trip along the West Coast in 2018 and a four-week trip from Amsterdam to Spain in 2019.
 Benjamin Tangora, a robotics major, earned silver medals in the SkillsUSA competition for humanoid robotics. He also competed in Savage Soccer, an engineering, robotics and design competition sponsored by Worcester Polytechnic Institute, for the past four years. Tangora is a violinist, archer, fencer and hiker. He completed a three-week hike along the Appalachian Train in 2017. He is a member of Minuteman's game club.

WASHINGTON - The US economy lost a staggering 20.5 million jobs in April, the steepest plunge in payrolls since the Great Depression and the starkest sign yet of how the novel coronavirus pandemic is battering the world's biggest economy.
 The Labor Department's closely watched monthly employment report on Friday also showed the unemployment rate surging to 14.7% last month, shattering the post-World War II record of 10.8% touched in November 1982.
 The bleak numbers strengthen analysts' expectations of a slow recovery from the recession caused by the pandemic, adding to a pile of dismal data on consumer spending, business investment, trade, productivity and the housing market. The report underscores the devastation unleashed by lockdowns imposed by states and local governments in mid-March to slow the spread of COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the virus.
 The economic crisis spells trouble for President Donald Trump's bid for a second term in the White House in November's election. After the Trump administration was criticized for its initial reaction to the pandemic, Trump is eager to reopen the economy, despite a continued rise in COVID-19 infections and dire projections of deaths.
 "Our economy is on life support now," said Erica Groshen, a former commissioner of the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics. "We will be testing the waters in the next few months to see if it can emerge safely from our policy-induced coma," added Groshen, who is now a senior extension faculty member at the Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations.
 Economists polled by Reuters had forecast nonfarm payrolls diving by 22 million. Data for March was revised to show 870,000 jobs lost instead of 701,000 as previously reported. A record streak of job growth dating to October 2010 ended in March. The unemployment was forecast rising to 16% from 4.4% in April.
 Though millions of Americans continue to file claims for unemployment benefits, April could mark the trough in job losses. More small businesses are accessing their portion of an almost $3 trillion fiscal package, which made provisions for them to get loans that could be partially forgiven if they were used for employee salaries.
 The Federal Reserve has also thrown businesses credit lifelines and many states are also partially reopening.
 Companies like Walmart and Amazon are hiring workers to meet huge demand in online shopping. Truck drivers are also in demand, while supermarkets, pharmacies and courier companies need workers. Still, economists do not expected a quick rebound in the labor market.
 "Given the expected shift in consumer behavior reflecting insecurities regarding health, wealth, income, and employment, many of these firms will not reopen or, if they do reopen, hire fewer people," said Steve Blitz, chief economist at TS Lombard in New York. "This is one reason why we see the underlying recession extending through the third quarter."
 Economists say the economy entered recession in late March, when nearly the whole country went into COVID-19 lockdowns.
 The National Bureau of Economic Research, the private research institute regarded as the arbiter of US recessions, does not define a recession as two consecutive quarters of decline in real gross domestic product, as is the rule of thumb in many countries. Instead, it looks for a drop in activity, spread across the economy and lasting more than a few months.

What will Darlow offer to the players?
 “The goal is to teach athletes how to build personal brands that set them up for success in life, regardless of what happens in sports,” Darlow said. “Too often athletes are defined entirely by their athletic careers without developing influence in other areas of passion. My goal is to change that.”
 “This is going to be a great educational tool for our student-athletes,” Brown said. “Jeremy has created a game plan that will teach athletes how to manage, market and build their personal brands. “I look forward to incorporating his ideas into our player development program.”
 That fits in perfectly with what Brown already had begun developing throughout his first season as WVU coach and into his second.
 Brown has implemented a “5th-Quarter Program” for the team to assist in the development of the total player. In that program, branding is a component under “Real Life.” The other pillars of the program are character development, leadership development, social responsibility and career development.
 Darlow’s program is simple and fits easily into the players’ schedules.
 The WVU release summed it up this way:
 “Each week, student-athletes will watch a short video lesson covering one of his philosophies on brand development. At the end of each video, student- athletes are then given the option to complete an assignment found in their copy of his book, The DARLOW Rules. Those homework assignments make up portions of the student-athlete’s personal brand marketing plan.”
 This is a leap into the future for WVU football.
 “Today, more than at any other point in history, athletes have the opportunity to build personal brands that transcend the sports they play,” Darlow said. “Thanks to the exposure and influence offered by social media, these young men and women can now control their own brand destiny.”
 Rest assured that some universities will not welcome the NCAA’s new ruling which, in some ways, puts their own players in competition with their own brand.
 As a fan, do you purchase an officially licensed WVU football jersey or do you go for a T-shirt carrying the players likeness and number and name with no mention ot WVU made by a company that is paying him for his likeness?
 But WVU has jumped on board and expects to get a recruiting boost from exerting the effort to help their players understand the new system, the opportunities it presents and ways to approach it, lessons they will be able to take with them beyond the college years.

They also have an amazing emergency fund that they had allocated for situations like this. So, over a year ago, Your Mom Cares funded this incredible program at a hospital in Pittsburgh to create technology for at-risk youth to be able to go to therapy online. It's this app that is paired to a therapist and they can do all of these mental health exercises from their phones but have real-time connection to therapists. It's all documented and filtered through their medical records so it's all cohesive, and they funded this technology before we knew anything like this would happen. Now, it's really important that they have all of this data and that they've been pioneering it because it's what we need at this time. It's been incredible to see the impact that something that they'd already been working on is having -- so many other organizations and other hospitals are reaching out to them for the technology.

PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) — Some ski resorts in Oregon are preparing to reopen, but exactly when is still up in the air. Gov. Kate Brown announced earlier this week that some outdoor recreation activities can resume as the coronavirus pandemic continues. Brown is expected to issue an executive order to officially allow ski resorts to resume operations in the coming days, Oregon Public Broadcasting reported. John Burton, spokesman for Timberline Lodge and Ski Area on Mount Hood, said the resort, which touts year-round skiing, has been getting ready to reopen and plans to hire back workers it laid off in April. He said they also plan to hire additional full-time cleaning crews. Depending on when the governor’s executive order comes out, Burton said Timberline could reopen at a limited capacity as early as the end of next week. Operations at other ski resorts in the state are less clear. Dave Tragethon, vice president at Mount Hood Meadows, said it plans to reopen later this year, but the skiing and snowboarding season there has already ended. “We’re working through plans for lodging and culinary services and possibly for some summer operations.” In Bend, Mount Bachelor spokeswoman Leigh Capozzi said their crews are waiting for more guidance from the governor before making any decisions.

ELKINS — In an effort to understand declining firefly populations, the West Virginia Division of Natural Resources has launched a citizen science project to track lightning bug sightings in the Mountain State.

 “This is a chance for parents to take their family out to catch fireflies in a glass jar or watch these incredible insects light up the neighborhood at night,” said Mack Frantz, state zoologist. “Many people have fond memories of chasing lightning bugs when they were a kid and we want to make sure these insects thrive so future generations can enjoy this magical experience.”

If you wish to vote by mail you must submit an application for an absentee ballot by May 21. If approved, you’ll receive a ballot by mail to be filled out and returned to your county election board by noon on primary day.
 Early voting could be simplified. Specifically, the process for receiving and submitting both the absentee ballot application and the ballot is clunky.
 Some county clerks’ websites do not include an application form for a mail-in ballot. The secretary of state’s site has at least three different versions of the form and fails to provide clear instructions about the differences.
 One version must be printed out, filled out by hand and mailed, emailed or faxed to the county clerk. But this form and the variations of it do not include email addresses and fax numbers for county clerk’s offices; you have to call your clerk’s office for that information.
 Another version of the application form can be filled out electronically but must be printed to sign by hand.
 Most Hoosiers will find the third version of the application form easiest to use. You can fill it out, authorize it and submit it electronically by following these steps.

OKLAHOMA CITY -- Mere days after the Oklahoma Supreme Court struck down a requirement that absentee ballots be notarized, House Republicans moved to reverse the ruling.
   
 Despite fierce opposition from House Democrats, Republicans passed an amended bill Wednesday that seeks to reinstate the notary requirement.
   
 The amendment's author, Rep. Chris Kannady, R-Oklahoma City, said the legislation was born out of recommendations from State Election Board Secretary Paul Ziriax, Oklahoma's top elections official.
   
 Senate Bill 210, which passed the House on a near-party-line vote, would require absentee ballots to be notarized, which was the procedure in place until the Oklahoma Supreme Court ordered otherwise on Monday.
   
 In light of the COVID-19 crisis, Senate Bill 210 makes exceptions that would be in place for the June 30 primary election.
   
 If an emergency declaration is in effect within 45 days of a scheduled election, absentee voters would not have to get their ballot notarized. Instead, a person could sign the ballot and mail it back with a photocopy of their driver's license.
   
 Democrats argued the ability to make a photocopy presents a barrier to voting because it is not something easily accessible to everyone.
   
 "By passing this legislation, we're adding an unnecessary barrier for people to exercise their voting rights," said Rep. Kelly Allbright, D-Oklahoma City.
   
 The legislation also allows for some people who may have contracted COVID-19, those who may be susceptible to the virus or those are medically fragile to be considered "physically incapacitated" and able to request an absentee ballot be delivered to their home.
   
 The Supreme Court's ruling was an indicator state law on absentee voting needs to be updated, Kannady said. The court did not strike down Oklahoma's voting practices, it simply indicated state law needs clarity, he said.
   
 Kannady also suggested voter fraud would increase without the legislation, citing the sheer number of people who have requested absentee ballots since the court's ruling as an example of voter fraud. He did not make a clear link between why more requests for absentee ballots indicates voter fraud is occurring.
   
 Republicans repeatedly argued the notary requirement works to help prevent voter fraud. Asked specific questions about how often voter fraud occurs in Oklahoma, they said it was hard to quantify, but many offered anecdotal examples from their own political campaigns.
   
 Democratic lawmakers spent over an hour questioning Kannady on the bill, pointing to technical issues and giving examples of how the bill would create barriers to voting. They also criticized the fast-track treatment the bill received.
   
 With the June 30 election rapidly approaching, Kannady argued the Legislature had to act fast to give state election officials direction.
   
 House Majority Floor Leader Emily Virgin said the legislation was politically motivated, in part, because Republicans want State Question 802, which seeks to expand Medicaid, to fail on June 30.
   
 "I find it pretty ironic that we found a way to let representatives vote by proxy when we're not at the Capitol, but we're not willing to trust the public to have sort of the same process in place," she said.
   
 SB 210 is part of a larger Republican Party strategy to make it harder for people across the country to vote, she said, dismissing arguments about voter fraud.
   
 Oklahoma doesn't have widespread voter fraud and neither do the states that don't require absentee ballots to be notarized, she said.
   
 The legislation passed on a vote of 74-26. The bill now heads to the Senate for approval.

It’s also great to preserve stories about them that can be shared for generations to come. Those stories paint a clearer picture of who they were and how they lived.
 I have many stories about my mother and of other relatives as well. I cherish those stories.
 Anyone who knew her saw a very sweet-natured, kind and caring woman. Her public persona was who she was at home.
 She was also a bit on the timid side and no better example of that was her first attempts to learn how to drive, the prospect of which frightened her to her core.
 My mother was 19 and my father was 17 when they married. Keep in mind that 17 years old back then didn’t mean he was still in high school with parents supporting him and his biggest concern was finding a date for the prom.
 He had already quit school by necessity to survive and had been working full time in a saw mill for two years.
 He was a responsible, independent man, with a wife and a car.
 And, of course, he decided to teach my mother how to drive it.
 He took her somewhere up Pigeon Creek on a dirt road where the only living things around were cows, and put her behind the wheel.
 Of course, back then all vehicles, I think, were manual, so he took her through the gears and showed her how to use the clutch.
 When he was confident she had the hang of it, he asked her to start the engine, put it in first gear, slowly release the clutch as she nudged the gas pedal, and move down the road. Great instructions.
 She did start it up, but straightaway things went wrong. A lot of anxiety probably caused her to ram the shifter into reverse rather than first, and immediately release the clutch with a foot apparently stomping the gas.

Then the quality is top notch! Tom is a French cooking school graduate and Michele – not to be out done – learned the methods of her mother, grandmother and also grabbed some special recipes of Tom’s long deceased mother. She practiced all until she got the nod of approval from each of us, including Tom, that she had mastered the techniques of each of those three masters. Now you know all that but please wait a day or so before casually dropping in for lunch. We are already challenged to the max just getting it on the table for the two of us in some sort of timely manner!

Man arrested with stolen gun
   
 SALINA -- A MAN was arrested Wednesday after authorities determined he was a convicted felon in possession of a stolen gun.
   
 Salina Police said Wednesday an officer was sent to Wilson Security Solutions, 527 S. Broadway Blvd., for a man, Kristoffer Augustine, 29, of Salina, in possession of a handgun. Augustine was seeking assistance with the weapon malfunctioning and the store called police because of his behavior.
   
 According to police, Augustine left the store before the officer arrived, but it was discovered that Augustine is a convicted felon who was not to be in possession of a firearm.
   
 An officer located Augustine walking in the 1500 block of East Crawford Street. He was in possession of the gun, a Taurus PT111 9 mm. A methamphetamine pipe was also found on Augustine.
   
 Police said the weapon was registered to a 34-year-old Salina man who lives in the 700 block of North Front Street. Police made contact with the man, who said the gun was stolen sometime between 11 p.m. Tuesday and 12:05 a.m. Wednesday. The man suspected Augustine stole the gun, which was lying on a desk in the man's living room.
   
 Augustine was arrested in connection to criminal possession of a firearm, possession of a firearm while under the influence, possession of methamphetamine, possession of drug paraphernalia and theft of a firearm.

The USD weakened against a number of its counterparts, ahead of the release of the US employment report for April during the American session today. The release is expected to show the grim picture of the US employment market, with the effect of a full month of lockdown measures imposed on the US economy in order to slow the spreading of COVID 19. Unemployment rate is expected to rise reaching 16% and the NFP figure to reach a record low of -22 million, while the predicted acceleration of the average earnings growth rate is not expected to provide comfort for investors. The market sentiment seems to be fuelled by the gradual reopening of various economies around the world over the past few days, as well as some sort of economic normalization. Also, analysts tend to note that the USD may also have weakened as U.S. short-term bond yields hit record low levels, with markets starting to price in negative U.S. interest rates for the first time. At this point it should be mentioned that the Fed has steadily resisted the idea of negative rates over the past two meetings, yet the price action may suggest that part of the markets may expect a much worse downturn for the US economy. Should the market sentiment continue we could see the USD weakening further and such a sentiment could be further enhanced should there be a negative surprise in the US employment release later today, unless the safe haven qualities of the green back come to the rescue. AUD/USD moved higher and breaking the 0.6490 (S1) resistance line now turned to support. We maintain our bullish bias for the pair and for it to change we would require a clear breaking of the upward trendline incepted since the 7th of the month. It should be noted that the pair seems to be in a make or break position as it is about to test the prementioned upward trendline. Should the bulls maintain control over the pair, we could see it breaking he 0.6615 (R1) resistance line and aim for the 0.6700 (R2) resistance level. Should the bears take over, we could see the pair breaking the prementioned upward trendline, the 0.6490 (S1) support line and aim for the 0.6385 (S2) support level.

La International Board autorizó, tras una propuesta de la FIFA y de forma excepcional, que puedan realizarse 5 cambios por partido y otro en en el tiempo suplementario en esta recta final de temporada, ante la grave crisis del coronavirus.
 El organismo rector que se encarga de actualizar y modernizar el reglamento del fútbol advirtió, no obstante, que las modificaciones sólo se podrán hacer en tres tandas para no generar mayores interrupciones durante el juego.
 Por otro lado, la International Board dejó en manos de las federaciones la potestad de usar o no el VAR, dado que las cabinas donde se realizan los videoarbitrajes podrían ir a contramano de las recomendaciones sanitarias de distanciamiento para evitar probables contagios de Covid_19.
 "En relación con las competiciones en las que se aplica el sistema de vídeo árbitro asistente (VAR), se permite que estas competiciones dejen de utilizarse al reiniciarse a discreción de cada organizador de la competición. Sin embargo, cuando se utilice el VAR, todos los aspectos de las Reglas de Juego y, por extensión, el protocolo del VAR seguirán vigentes", finaliza el comunicado.
 ## El comunicado oficial
   
  _Cuando el fútbol comienza a considerar la reanudación de las competiciones en todo el mundo tras la pandemia de COVID-19, el International Football Association Board (IFAB) ha acordado hacer una enmienda temporal a las Reglas de Juego basada en una propuesta recibida de la FIFA que busca proteger el bienestar de los jugadores._
 _En el caso de las competiciones que ya han comenzado o que se prevé que comiencen, pero cuya finalización está prevista para el 31 de diciembre de 2020, el IFAB ha aprobado la propuesta de la FIFA de introducir una enmienda temporal en la Regla 3 - Los jugadores, que permitirá realizar un máximo de cinco sustitutos por equipo. Sin embargo, para evitar la interrupción del juego, cada equipo sólo tendrá tres oportunidades de hacer sustituciones; las sustituciones también podrán hacerse en el descanso._
 _La enmienda temporal entra en vigor con efecto inmediato y se ha hecho porque los partidos pueden jugarse en un período condensado en condiciones climáticas diferentes, lo que podría tener repercusiones en el bienestar de los jugadores. La decisión de aplicar o no esta enmienda temporal quedará a discreción de cada organizador de competición, mientras que el IFAB y la FIFA determinarán en una fase posterior si esta enmienda temporal tendría que prorrogarse más (por ejemplo, para las competiciones que deben concluirse en 2021)._
 _La enmienda a la Regla 3 afecta tanto a las Reglas de Juego de 2019/20 como a las de 2020/21, entrando estas últimas en vigor a partir del 1 de junio de 2020._
  _En relación con las competiciones en las que se aplica el sistema de vídeo árbitro asistente (VAR), se permite que estas competiciones dejen de utilizarse al reiniciarse a discreción de cada organizador de la competición. Sin embargo, cuando se utilice el VAR, todos los aspectos de las Reglas de Juego y, por extensión, el protocolo del VAR seguirán vigentes._

Otherwise, you might be in for a nasty bill shock! The other downside to oil column heaters is that you’ll probably be waiting a while for it to heat up too.

There are so many ways we have altered the patterns of communications and socializing in our daily lives. We can longer “bump into” people, have group hugs or cocktail parties.
 Everything we hold sacred in developing relationships, sharing thoughts and being close to people are not permitted and social distancing is antithetical to what most of us do as we strive for recognition and individual identity in our lives. In short, social distancing is setting all of us back.
 We all strive day-to-day to beat the system. We defeat boredom by making lots of phone calls. The cell phone industry says that calling time is up 30% and many people are working from home stressing out the capacity of the internet. In fact, the emergence of computer and cell phone use has been an unintended rehearsal for living with this tragic pandemic. The good news is that computer communications…email use and the development of Facebook, Tweeter and the many other APPS along with cellphones, have offered up, on a silver platter, the ability for keeping in touch with business colleagues and social friends. The bad news is that these devices are remote and cold substitutes for face-to- face meetings.
 However, millions of Americans as well as television networks have been using Zoom, Webex, Skype, Facetime and other means of appearing on camera face-to- face, individually or in groups. There are now very few interviews taking place in taking place in television studios. It is the hope that people have attempted to become more effusive and intimate in these communications. This may be their only opportunity for socializing for a while.
 When the world does come back to normal…well the new normal…we’ll have a number of challenges in the way we adjust back to continued restrictions like social distancing.
 The main principal to be thinking about is not letting the current experience cast a pall over all that makes people good, our ability to relate to one another and create a sense of community.
 Let us make the emergence of the new electronic means of communications…the internet and cellphones…work to enhance our connection to others. It would be a pretty day if everyone made these tools more of a sharing of sentiments, the recollection of great past times and the hope for the future.

With millions quarantining, much of the real estate industry was able to shift to digital services, such as virtual open houses, online paperwork and electronic signing. And Ducey’s “Stay Home, Stay Healthy, Stay Connected” executive order clarified real estate as an essential service, which barred cities and counties from issuing regulations to restrict their business, but encouraged the use of telecommuting.
 According to Kaplan, these two aspects combined allowed the real estate industry to be “well ahead of the curve” with regards to closures and quarantines.
 Tucson’s housing market is faring a bit better than the national market on multiple fronts. According to the National Association of Realtors’ Weekly Housing Market Monitor, national pending home sales decreased by 20.8 percent in March. But in the Tucson Metro Area, pending home sales are down 13.5 percent from before COVID closures began.
 Data from NAR’s Weekly Housing Market Monitor indicated that individual housing prices are holding up compared to the decline in transaction activity; the average listing price on pending contracts in the four weeks through April 26 is up 2.6 percent from last year. Nationally as of April 18, the listing prices are still slightly higher in 65 out of the largest 100 metro areas than they were last year. The same can be said for the Tucson area, with average housing prices remaining more or less consistent. However, it remains to be seen whether Tucson’s housing prices will suffer a delayed reduction from COVID-19.
 “There’s a lot of pent-up demand right now, and when things start to get back to normal over the coming months, I think we’ll see a bounce-back from that 15 percent down,” Kaplan said.
 Of course, it’s impossible to say exactly when industry will bounce back, or if recent upticks will continue. It is also worth noting that March through May is usually busy buying season in Tucson’s real estate market, which may have momentarily lessened the quarantine’s impacts.
 “If you need to buy or sell, you can still proceed with that, you don’t have to wait,” Kaplan said. “And one of the things that’s happened is the institutional buyers – the corporations that are buying and flipping – have pulled out because of the volatility of the stock market… so if you’ve been house hunting, this may have created a window to find something that you couldn’t find before.”

The race to develop a vaccine that would end the coronavirus pandemic is accelerating as several firms move to clinical trials – but the World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that it is unlikely we will have a vaccine before the end of 2021.
 The development and mass distribution of a vaccine is widely seen as the most likely way to bring the coronavirus pandemic under control. Governments across the world have pumped money into vaccine research as pharmaceutical companies, startup businesses, universities, and research institutes work night and day to develop a vaccine.
 Three of the US’ biggest pharmaceutical companies – Inovio, Moderna, and Pfizer – have already started clinical trials, seen as the first stage of developing a vaccine. In the UK, researchers at Oxford University supported by the government have said they are aiming to produce a vaccine by the autumn.
 While some may find hope in the fact that vaccines have reached the trial stage, which means they are being tested on humans to see if they work, senior WHO official Dale Fisher warned this week that a vaccine is unlikely to be available until the end of 2021.
 “I think end of next year is a very reasonable expectation,” said Fisher, who is the chair of the WHO’s Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network, during an interview with CNBC on Monday.   “People need to have their expectations checked, I think, rather than blindly, hopefully doing what you want because you want it,” he added.
 This is because the vaccines currently under clinical trials are in Phase 1 of the development process, but must go through Phase 2 and 3 of trials to ensure they are safe and reliable.
 Even once a vaccine is found to be suitable, it will then need to be mass produced and mass distributed – a potentially lengthy process in itself.

Of course, all else is rarely equal with a company like this. As noted in the highlights, Suncor saw its production decline year-over-year. This was mostly due to the company's MacKay River facility being offline for repairs. In the prior year quarter, this facility was fully operational and so was able to contribute to the company's production, but obviously this was not the case in the current quarter. This also had a negative impact on the company's revenues. It should also be obvious why this would be the case. After all, if the company produced fewer products, then it would have had less oil and gas to sell and thus to generate revenues off of.
 As was the case with many other oil and gas companies, Suncor has responded to the decline in resource prices by reducing its capital expenses. In its report, the company has stated that it now plans to have total capital expenditures of C$3.6 to C$4.0 billion in 2020, which is about a C$400 million reduction from its previous plans. Admittedly, I have not been a particular fan of these capital reductions at other companies because the companies have been slashing their planned spending on their exploration programs, which will reduce their ability to maintain their reserves. However, Suncor Energy does not have this problem. This is because Suncor Energy has a substantial quantity of resources in the Canadian oil sands. I explained this in a past article on the company. The size of its reserves in this area should allow the company to produce for many years even if it does not discover any more resources. Thus, Suncor can effectively slash its exploration spending in a way that no other company can.
 Suncor fortunately did explain how this reduction in capital expenditures will change its strategy going forward. The company stated that it will be focusing on projects that deliver the maximum amount of value as opposed to simply focusing on production growth at all costs. The company did not provide any specific growth projects that it will be continuing to work on, although it did provide some hints. The company did, for example, state that it will continue to find the pipelines between the Syncrude facility and the Oil Sands Base. This project will not necessarily deliver any growth per se, but it will help to improve the takeaway capacity from the oil sands region, which is something that the region urgently needs. The company also stated that it will be deferring the construction of some of its power generation facilities. This decrease in capital spending will likely slow down the company's forward growth trajectory but this may not be a bad thing given the current low oil price environment.

 Currently, we know how valuable stellar coverage linebackers are, as the NFL leans more toward the pass every year. However, it's intriguing that the defensive coordinators for Murray and Brooks decided to use their extraordinary athletic gifts for QB spy and blitzing roles instead of asking them to drop in coverage.
 And the Big 12 has had a major impact on the NFL offensively of late. Maybe adapting a few Big 12 defensive principles is the logical next step for NFL defenses? If so, Murray and Brooks could very well usher in the new era of what a star linebacker will look like in the pros. But in "normal" linebacker roles as rookies on passing plays, they're likely to look completely out of sorts often.

In a special Lakeway City Council meeting held virtually Monday evening, members considered various proposals to its charter, ranging from declaring a place system for dais candidates to changing the date of its elections from May to November, holding a vote every two years with two- or four-year term limits.
   
 Following almost three hours of discussion, the council agreed that more data is needed regarding a change to an at-large place system with three year terms and two term limits for council members as well as a comparison of election dates--November or May--before a final decision could be made on all of the proposed charter amendments.The dais plans to resume its debate on these two remaining items at its scheduled June 1 special session.
   
 Dave DeOme, Charter Review Committee chair and former Lakeway mayor, presented the group's 10 proposed charter changes after culling a list of 18 proposals.
   
 The city's ninth charter review is being conducted to correct an error in its election terms that contradicts the state constitution, DeOme said. Its charter was first adopted in 1990.
   
 Mayor Sandy Cox voiced concern that once the charter review changes are complete, the city wouldn't ultimately fix the document to comply with state law.
   
 In addition to adopting a place system with three-year terms for council elections, the committee recommended conducting run-off elections by a majority vote; filling council vacancies by a special election called within four months; deleting an election requirement for certificates of obligation; deleting the requirement that the city manager be a city resident; and designating the mayor's appointee as the chair of the Charter Review Committees. At the meeting, the council agreed to add a stipulation that the appointee to the Charter Review Committee also be approved by council members.
   
 November versus May elections
   
 With the exception of the election date consideration, DeOme said the committee vote on the proposals was unanimous. The item brought up a rigorous debate between council members on May 4.
   
 "In the interest of saving money and getting the highest turnout, (November) just makes sense to me," Council Member Laurie Higginbotham said of the measure. She also said voters get fatigued by returning to the polls in May for a city election in addition to November's general vote.
   
 The item was not prioritized as part of the group's ten top proposals but instead pulled by council members for discussion.
   
 DeOme said Secretary of State statistics showed turnout in November elections is high in even-numbered years when the president is elected, posting a tally of 48% of registered voters. However, in odd-numbered years, he said the turnout is only 9.5% and suggested that being a candidate in a month when there are many elections pending makes it more difficult for him or her to get their message out.
   
 Council Member Gretchen Vance countered DeOme's statement and said Travis County reflects a much higher turnout in November than May in non-national year elections. Council Member Steve Smith said a November election allows the winning candidates to get accustomed to being on the dais before reviewing the city budget in the summer, and Higginbotham offered that a November election poses a lower expense for the city by combining with other elections. She also said the fall month would be an easier date for residents to get engaged about the candidates since more races are being run.
   
 Place system versus at-large positions
   
 City Attorney Cobby Caputo said a shift to three-year terms requires a place system and a change to how vacancies on the dais are filled.
   
 Council Members Sanjeev Kumar and Smith said the proposed place system wasn't contemplated by the 2014 voters when they approved three-year council terms with two consecutive term limits. Smith said he feared one vote-getter may gain a seat with far fewer votes than a candidate in another place who garners more votes.
   
 DeOme said those issues were discussed by the committee but "at the end of the day we felt that it was important that we go to the three year term." He said the city doesn't have as much turnover in a given election with the longer term and a three-year term allows the council members to come up to speed with the position, "a benefit to the people of Lakeway."
   
 Council Member Laurie Higginbotham suggested retaining the city's current two- year term limits, putting the three-year term limits to the voters at a future election.
   
 City manager's residence
   
 Some council members pushed to drop the residency requirement for the city manager, with the majority of the dais agreeing to leave the proposal as addressed.
   
 Smith said he felt the city manager shouldn't be restricted to live within the city limits but should reside close enough to the city -- within 30 minutes -- to be able to get to the jurisdiction quickly.
   
 Higginbotham said she prefers to review what neighboring cities do regarding their city managers since those positions would be in competition with Lakeway. West Lake Hills doesn't have a residency requirement and the past six weeks of COVID-19 restrictions has shown the viability of staff being able to work remotely, she said.
   
 Council Member Doug Howell said retaining a residency requirement may force the city to pay more for the candidate since the area has a high cost of housing.
   
 The final charter amendments are slated to be approved by voters on Nov. 2.

NICEVILLE - Around her junior year, Erica Scarborough's collegiate dream of cheerleading - much like her tumbler sensibilities - took flight.
   
 A year later, minus the pomp and circumstance of a traditional signing ceremony, the Niceville state champion will be continuing her high-flying talents at the University of South Florida.
   
 Last week the 18-year-old etched her future in a home ceremony alongside family, Niceville coaches Tanya Herndon and Brittany Reegans, Niceville principal Charlie Marello and Niceville athletic director Grant Thompson.
   
 "It was really fun," Scarborough said of the memorable day. "Mr. Marello, my coach, my family … under the circumstances they made me feel real special even though I wasn't able to have everyone there."
   
 Special is just how USF made Scarborough feel. As for when the courtship began, that'd be November during a cheer camp.
   
 "When I first went there, it just felt family oriented and I enjoyed everything about it all," she said. "We walked around the campus and it was beautiful - there was lots of greenery. Then I went to cheerleading clinic where they assessed your skills and they just had super helpful critiques and were so welcoming.
   
 "I wanted to continue that feeling."
   
 All she needed was an offer. Come March, right at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, social distancing and following her swan song efforts to help lead the Eagles to a 2A FHSAA state championship, USF called and wanted Scarborough as part of its rebuilding program.
   
 Scarborough didn't think twice. And a plan was hatched to celebrate her big day.
   
 "Erica emailed me during the school closures with an attached picture of her scholarship offer and letter of intent from USF," Marello said. "She said she wanted to share the good news with me and hoped it would lift my spirits. Although she didn't say it, I know she was disappointed to not be able to have our normal athletic signing ceremony in the auditorium in front of the media, with her teammates, friends and family there.
   
 "So I decided if we couldn't host her signing ceremony here at NHS, we could bring the signing ceremony to her."
   
 Scarborough will head to USF on Aug. 12. In Orlando she has family and her twin sister, Erin, is within a couple of hours at UCF.
   
 Once there she hopes to make an immediate impact, first just simply cheering at football, basketball and volleyball games. Then eventually in competition.
   
 "It's really a great environment for me all-around," she said. "I'm looking forward to starting the next chapter in my cheerleading career."

PLYMOUTH - As the cranberry industry in Massachusetts continues to get hammered by dwindling profits and overproduction, Gov. Charlie Baker announced that his administration has secured $10 million in federal funds to help approved growers transition out of the industry.
 The Baker-Polito Administration announced that $10 million in federal funding can be used for ecological restoration of former bogs.
 Cape Cod Cranberry Growers Association Executive Director Brian Wick explained what that means.
 Under this funding program, he said, some growers can sell U.S. Department of Agriculture easements to bogs, receiving funding to take the bog out of cranberry production. The cranberry grower would still retain ownership of the land, and sell it to a town, land trust or other group.
 As such, these former boglands could be used for future well sites for towns or for passive recreation such as walking trails.
 "It's a competitive process," Wick said. "Any grower in the state can submit an application. The applications go into the pool and are ranked based on environmental criteria. Our goal at the Association is to get as many growers into the program as possible who are interested. Not only does the funding go toward the grower retiring the bog, it also goes toward restoring the bog to a natural wetland."
 Baker praised the program, which is coming at a crucial moment.
 "The cranberry industry has been a part of the state's history and landscape for over 200 years, and this grant builds on the recommendations of the Cranberry Revitalization Task Force by supporting growers while also restoring important habitat for fish and wildlife and increasing resilience to climate change," Baker said in a statement.
 According to Baker's office, The Massachusetts Department of Fish and Game's Division of Ecological Restoration (DER) and 17 partner organizations will use the funding to work with landowners to protect and restore historic wetlands on retiring cranberry bogs. The hope is to restore 900 acres of wetlands and permanently protect 1,800 acres of open space.
 The funding will support seven projects that are already part of DER's Priority Project Program in Plymouth, Falmouth, Freetown, Mattapoisett, Rochester, Wareham, and Harwich. An additional 13 projects will be selected in southern Massachusetts through a competitive process. Restoration and land protection project sites may be owned by cranberry farmers, towns, land trusts, or other public or private organizations.
 Meanwhile, legislators have urged more funding for the beleaguered cranberry industry from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act, which is funding relief in the billions of dollars.
 In April, U.S. Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Edward Markey, and U.S. Rep. William Keating signed a letter penned to the United States Department of Agriculture to use some of the $9.5 billion in CARES funding for farmers to provide pandemic funding to the cranberry industry, among those hard hit by the crisis.
 The missive references reports that cranberry farms could experience sales declines as high as $688 million, and notes that the CARES Act includes $9.5 billion for farmers. It is up to the USDA to distribute the funds, and legislators and others are hoping more relief is on the way to an industry that has helped shape the historic and economic profile of the state.

Former Pakistan captain and chairman of selectors Inzamam-ul-Haq is one of the finest batsmen to have come out of the country. He was a pillar of strength for his team in the middle order through the 90s and the first decade of 2000s.
 A stalwart in both Tests and ODIs, Inzamam registered his highest international score in the summer of 2002. Batting against New Zealand on a deadpan surface at Lahore's Gaddafi Stadium, Inzamam extracted a massive toll from the Kiwi attack, hitting them for 329 runs with the help of 38 boundaries and 9 maximums.
 It was a match to forget for the Kiwis who were destroyed by Shoaib Akhtar in the first innings as they succumbed to an innings defeat. The second match of the series was slated to take place in Karachi but the series was abandoned mid-way after a bomb blast near the team hotel.
 Inzamam, recently spoke about the incident on his youtube channel while speaking about his knock of 329 against Kiwis.
 "None of the players got injured but that was a scary day. My room was on the side where the impact of the blast took place. Thankfully I wasn't in the room as teh glass on the windows pander broke and hit the wall on the opposite side.
 "We were just about to leave for the ground when the incident took place. Players were mostly leaving for breakfast. I heard something but couldn't understand what had happened. All the curtains and window panes had broken. I asked a guard and he told me there was a bomb blast.
 "I was asked to go to the basement and there I saw all the New Zealand players in the swimming pool and they were all crying. These players had never experienced something like this back home," Inzamam said while recounting the horrific incident.

 He further added that the Kiwis went back home but the Pakistani players had to deal with the trauma of the blast.
 "The players of our team were troubled for at least a week if not more," he said.
 The blast had taken place in front of the neighbouring Sheraton Hotel where a sucide bomber had detonated a bomb inside a car. 11 French engineers who were in a bus died along with two Pakistanis and the bomber himself.

Before my father could say “Henry Ford!” she backed the car into a fence, almost knocking down a fence post.
 After he straightened the post and assessed the damage, which was minor, he was a bit relieved and had the courage to continue the lesson. My mother was in tears and didn’t want to continue, but he insisted.
 The next time, she pulled out okay and was coasting down the road, but then while attempting to shift into second gear lost control of the car and ran over a log.
 I can’t remember how many lessons she had, but none ended well, and they both eventually gave up.
 Now we get to my part of this saga.
 When she was in her 50s she decided she finally wanted to learn how to drive and get a car.
 I actually tried to talk her out of it, fearing for her, and everyone else’s, safety. But she talked Aunt Ebb into teaching her, and I did not think that would go well since they fussed all the time anyway.
 In fact, the whole family was on pins and needles. Not only was my mother never adept at operating any kind of machinery, she also tended to be easily distracted. And her sense of direction was almost non-existence (a trait both my daughters apparently inherited).
 But, by gosh, she learned and purchased her own car for the first time in her live. Certainly, I was pleased she finally had the freedom she always wanted, rather than depending on others for transportation. But the worry was still steady and strong.
 When I visited her after she had been driving for a couple of weeks, she wanted to take me for a ride. She was excited and proud, anxious to show me that she could actually do it.
 Sadly, I just could not bring myself to ride with her. I know, it was cowardly of me. I should have forced myself to get in that car and allow her that moment.
 But all I could see was that darn fence and log, which I had heard about countless times growing up.
 Well, the very next day, I backed into a tree.
 Justice was served.
