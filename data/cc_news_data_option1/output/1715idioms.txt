Tras anunciar sus planes de matrimonio en Estados Unidos, Vania Bludau y su pareja Frank Dello Russo habrían terminado su relación, según indica el programa “Magaly TV, la firme”. El reportaje señala que la ruptura amorosa se originó porque el abogado sigue pagando facturas por tener una cuenta en Tinder, aplicación para buscar pareja. Medina presentó el informe dice que “los finales felices solo suceden en la fantasía” y que en la vida real no pasa eso. “Ella le habría descubierto las facturas electrónicas que Frank Dello Russo pagaba por estar suscrito a Tinder”, menciona Magaly. Fuentes cercanas a la pareja contaron al programa de espectáculos que Vania Bludau ya no pasa la cuarentena con su exnovio. “Ella ha borrado todas las fotos que tenía junto a Frank Dello Russo. Ya no existe una foto del abogado americano con el que se habría comprometido en diciembre en Finlandia”, dijo la conductora del programa. “Vaina se habría sentido traicionada al encontrarle que él seguía con sus ‘aventurillas’ en Tinder. Incluso ya no se siguen en sus redes sociales”, añadió. Cabe señalar que la modelo peruana aún no ha confirmado la separación con Frank Dello Russo. Medina cerró el tema diciendo que no se descarta que la pareja se vuelva a dar una “segunda oportunidad”.

Trump has repeatedly clashed with the Democratic-controlled House over its moves to investigate his actions or those of his administration.
 In recent days, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer have urged wide-ranging investigations into Trump's handling of the coronavirus outbreak, which has killed tens of thousands of Americans.
 Democrats have criticized Trump, saying he has failed to develop a comprehensive and effective plan for testing Americans for the coronavirus and tracing contacts of those who are infected by the virus that causes the sometimes fatal COVID-19 respiratory disease.
 Fauci, 79, has had a respectful but sometimes complicated relationship with Trump.
 The well-regarded doctor has at times corrected or contradicted the president at White House briefings or in press interviews on issues such as the time required to develop a vaccine and the likelihood that the coronavirus will return in the fall.
 Trump has occasionally shown exasperation with Fauci but ultimately has followed, largely, the advice that he and Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House’s coronavirus task force coordinator, have provided on responding to the pandemic.
 Last month, the White House said Trump was not firing Fauci despite his retweet of a supporter’s #FireFauci message.
 At the time, White House spokesman Hogan Gidley said: "Dr. Fauci has been and remains a trusted adviser to President Trump."
 Aides to Fauci were not immediately available to comment on the House committee's desire to have him testify.

 “Before all this hit, I remember praying lord, heal these people bless these people. Then he asked me to go. It’s funny how the lord would rather do something through you than for you.”

 “This is basically going to be a way of life, OK? There are no ifs, no ands, no buts, no doubts, OK? And I certainly think, for the most part, if you can't distance inside or outside, you're going to be expected to wear a face covering or a mask.”
 Holyoke Mayor Alex Morse had previously called out the governor to make face coverings a state order.
 He thinks Baker is on the right track.
 “We’ve called on the state to continue taking as drastic actions as possible to protect as many people as possible,” Morse said. “I think it’s a step in the right direction. I mean, they’re more effective if more communities have them.”
 Morse said this order will only work if everyone is on board with it.
 “We wear masks not to protect ourselves, but to protest others, and others are wearing masks to protect us. So it only is effective if everyone is actually participating in that protection,” Morse said.
 Face coverings can be homemade or purchased.
 This order is in effect starting next Wednesday until further notice.

Solving the puzzle will inform a broad range of challenges, from the development of an effective vaccine to how soon governments may be able to safely end lockdowns and allow normal life to resume.

Lisa Taylor couldn't believe what was happening as she woke up in a hospital bed to nurses in hazmat suits and protective face gear.
   
 "I thought I was dreaming, or in a sci-fi movie," she said. "I didn't know what was happening."
   
 Taylor, 49, had been suffering from severe headaches, pressure in her face and sensitivity to light.
   
 "I've never had chronic headaches like the ones I was suffering from," said Taylor, who runs the Loving Hands Daycare and Preschool in her home, "but I knew it was more than a headache when I couldn't walk up the stairs in our home. I just had to stop, and gain enough strength to get back up the stairs.
   
 "It wasn't like I was totally out of breath; it was more like I was just exhausted, like I had run a marathon."
   
 A video chat with a doctor came up with a diagnosis of some kind of flu, and she says COVID-19 was never mentioned.
   
 "We decided that it would be best to ride out the illness, which we believed was the flu, at our lake home," Lisa said.
   
 "I don't know why I thought I would feel better at our lake house, I guess just because I always look so forward to going there and just getting away from everything," she said. "That's when it happened."
   
 Within one day "it" was a total breakdown of her body.
   
 "Anyone who knows me know how much I like to exercise, and then I'll put on my makeup and do my hair - I've always been full of energy - but while we were at the lake, I felt literally like I was going not going to be able to make it to the car to go to the hospital," she said.
   
 "I was still thinking I had the flu or something because I had had a video visit with my doctor and he gave me medicine for a sinus infection - because I had the severe headache. At this point I thought maybe they had misdiagnosed a sinus infection. It felt more like the flu."
   
 "While at the lake I began to deteriorate rapidly," she said. "I was washing my hair and I couldn't finish. Nothing was working; I had to lie down in the bathtub just to get the soap out of my hair. I couldn't stand up, I couldn't do anything."
   
 But she and her husband were still wondering what was wrong because she did not have the classic COVID-19 symptoms, a dry cough and shortness of breath or fever.
   
 Wade took his wife to the hospital, where she was rushed to the emergency room.
   
 "That was on Sunday, March 29th," she said. "They did a chest X-ray and tested me for COVID-19 - and here's the strange part. I didn't find out that I actually had the coronavirus until the following Tuesday - when my husband told me."
   
 Wade had received a call from the Jackson County Health Department and was told his wife had COVID-19. Before he could even digest the diagnosis, he was asked all sorts of questions about who we had been in contact with and how she had felt before arriving at the hospital - questions that were difficult to answer because he was still trying to wrap his head around the fact that his wife had tested positive for coronavirus.
   
 "It felt like I had the flu times 50 and I was going to die," Lisa said, "No one ever told me what was wrong with me. Now, I was so sick, uninformed, isolated and scared. I really got scared when Wade told me that I had COVID-19."
   
 When it was determined that Lisa had COVID-19 she was rushed from her hospital room to a makeshift COVID-19 ward with two other patients.
   
 "It was like a scene from the movie 'ET,'" she said. "Everyone was in haz-mat suits with masks. There was tape over the door, and I was terrified. They had on gloves, face shield, and I could tell they didn't want to come in contact with me, and that made it even scarier."
   
 She was now dealing with the fact that she had the COVID-19 virus, along with battling the severe headaches.
   
 "I just cried a lot," she said. "I know they must have thought I was difficult, but I really do not think they were aware of the physical and cognizant battle that was taking place in the four walls of my room."
   
 "It was so frightening - especially when I heard another patient coughing and gasping for air, that made it even more frightening. I laid in bed wondering if that was going to eventually be me. The one question I kept asking was, 'Am I getting better?'"
   
 "No one had answers for me as they were navigating uncharted territories. As we gain experience it is my hope that there are better systems and practices in place now.
   
 "And I still had that headache. I'll never forget that intense pain as long as I live - well, I'll never forget any of this. But I also want the nurses to know how much I appreciate that they put their lives on the line every day for someone like me, and I want to thank them for that."
   
 After four days in the hospital, Taylor and her husband felt like it was best for her to return home.
   
 "I got home, and Wade was amazing - anything I needed, he was right there for me," she said. "I know the nurses were instructed to get in and get out as quickly as possible, but I needed some TLC, and I got it at home."
   
 Lisa says it's important to tell her story to let those know who contact the virus that there is hope for a full recovery.
   
 "It's the worst thing I've ever been through, but I'm back home with my family," she said. "After being quarantined for 14 days I was allowed to resume my daily routine, and my kids were able to come back to preschool. I will never again take for granted being able to be with the ones I love. Because of this experience I value the small things more than ever before."
   
 "If I could offer any advice, it would be to seek medical attention as quickly as possible," she said. "There was talk that I might have had the COVID-19 eight-ten days before I went to the ER."
   
 She added, "It's better to err on the side of caution, get tested and find out what's happening."

One of the theories making the rounds in the NFL is that the teams that have the most stability in their coaching ranks, who in turn have the most familiarity with their returning players, will be best-positioned to hit the ground running if and when the COVID-19 restrictions are lifted.
 Count Buffalo Bills coach Sean McDermott as a firm believer.
 "We felt like the teams that come out of this the most prepared, the most unified, would potentially have created a competitive advantage," McDermott said Thursday during a 45-minute Zoom video conference call with reporters. "That remains to be seen, but we felt like when (virtual meetings) kicked off a week ago that we were ready to go. I give our staff a lot of credit for that."
 McDermott is entering his fourth season with the Bills, which ties him for 10th in the NFL in terms of coaches' tenure with their current teams. Further, defensive coordinator Leslie Frazier has been with him the whole time, and offensive coordinator Brian Daboll is now in his third year.
 Factor in general manager Brandon Beane and his top lieutenants on the personnel side and few teams can boast of that much continuity at the top.
 In this unique time in the history of the NFL and the world, that could prove to be critical in the development of the 2020 Bills, assuming training camp and the regular season eventually get going.
 McDermott covered a wide variety of topics during his first full media session since the NFL Scouting Combine in late February. Here are some of the highlights:
 Developing passing game is hindered
 One of the integral parts of organized team activities at this time of year is forging timing and chemistry between the quarterbacks and the pass catchers. That can't be done via Zoom.
 "We usually spend about 70% of our spring trying to shape our passing game," said McDermott. "There's no pads on so not a lot of sense spending a whole lot of time on the run game in spring ball. In training camp it flips a little bit, starts to even out, maybe 60-40, 50-50, because you have pads on and you can work the 9-on-7 drills. That's the biggest thing we're missing, time on task in developing the passing game."
 Diggs can thrive in Buffalo
 McDermott is big on culture, as we all know. And he's also confident in his abilities as a coach and a leader to extract every ounce of effort and accountability from his players. That's why he thinks Stefon Diggs, the biggest offseason acquisition, could have a major impact on the Buffalo offense.
 "When you look at the production Stefon has experienced through his career, that speaks for itself," said McDermott. "He's played in big games, he's had big roles in those games. We believe that it's been shone and proven that people are able to come to Buffalo and become the best version of themselves and he's certainly been awfully good to this point.
 "It's an opportunity for him to continue to grow and an opportunity for us to get a good football player who can help us win. The communication to this point has been top notch and he's been a nice addition."
 McDermott acknowledged that it is problematic that Diggs and Josh Allen are losing all this time to get acquainted on the field, but that's the hand that has been dealt to every other team.
 "I am concerned about it, but I'm not worried at this point," he said. "We'll have to do a really good job with practice plans so we can get those two on the same page. There's challenges for everyone but you try to find ways to adjust and adapt. Our theme this offseason has been 'Find a Way' and that really fits the time and situation and circumstances we're in."
 Rebound can be expected from Josh Norman
 The cornerback became a star during his four seasons in Carolina when McDermott was his defensive coordinator, then saw his star fall during his last four seasons with the Redskins after he signed a massive free agent contract.
 He signed a one-year deal with the Bills, reuniting with McDermott, and that might be just what he needs to resuscitate his career.
 "Watching Josh's film after he got released by the Redskins, there's been a lot of talk about how he played and maybe his chapter in Washington didn't unfold the way a lot of people had hoped," said McDermott.
 "Here's what I would tell you about Josh. He's a highly-competitive individual and sometimes the grass isn't always greener from a system or scheme standpoint, and culture as well. That's another example of people coming to Buffalo and regaining in this case a better version of one's self. He experienced great success in Carolina with our culture and system, and hopefully coming to a similar culture and system, he'll be able to regain his form. I know he's working hard."
 Offensive line in a good place
 The Bills overhauled their line last year with four new starters joining holdover Dion Dawkins, and the level of play was considerably better -- though it pretty much had to be -- after the rock-bottom performance in 2018.
 All five starters return, a couple veteran free agents have been added for depth, and McDermott feels good about the overall collection of talent.
 "There is added value in continuity," he said. "When you have a group like we had last year who for the most part had not played a snap, or many snaps, together going into the season, I thought they did some really good things and took some significant strides. Now to have that group back and to add a piece or two in there, is valuable to us. It's a veteran group, there's a lot of work to do, and we recognize that, but we're very comfortable with the group that we have."
 Virtual meetings are underway
 The team began doing Zoom calls last week among the veterans, and starting May 11 the newly-added draft picks will be able to participate.
 Just as if the team was able to be together in Orchard Park, McDermott has continued his tradition of combining football with real life, so a portion of every meeting is devoted to players stepping up and talking about themselves.
 "What we've tried to do is keep things as normal as we can at this time of year," he said. "Our players are used to sharing their stories in some way, shape or form, in order to help bring our team together.
 "We've continued doing that in our meetings, players are sharing, coaches are sharing, maybe where they live, tell their story, talk about their family. We have not gotten away from that because at the end of the day, these are human beings that we're trying to develop into a family, (building) a sense of camaraderie and the results and culture that come with that."
 Rookies have been assigned numbers
 The new players who joined the team last weekend now have jerseys to call their own.
 Second-round pick A.J. Epenesa will wear No. 57, and the former owner of that number, retired Lorenzo Alexander, wholeheartedly endorsed it. "Well I'm glad it's (Epenesa). Love the way he plays the game," Alexander tweeted.
 Third-round running back Zack Moss is taking over Frank Gore's role in the offense and is getting his No. 20, too.
 The two wide receivers, fourth-rounder Gabriel Davis and sixth-rounder Isaiah Hodgins will wear Nos. 3 and 87, respectively, while sixth-round kicker Tyler Bass gets No. 2, and seventh-round cornerback Dane Jackson gets No. 30.
 As for fifth-round quarterback Jake Fromm, he won't get to wear the No. 11 he wore at Georgia and will get No. 10. That's because wide receiver Cole Beasley has claimed the No. 11 jersey, the number he had during his time with the Cowboys. That number was held by Zay Jones when Beasley arrived last year.

NEW DELHI: Two days before the scheduled end of the national lockdown, the Centre on Friday extended it by another two weeks, but with significant easing of curbs intended to reopen the country and restart economic activity even in the red zones, leaving only containment areas under strict restrictions.   The movement of individuals for "non-essential" activities has been prohibited between 7pm and 7am, and senior citizens, persons with co-morbidities (health conditions) and children below 10 years are to stay at home except for health purposes. This can allow domestic help and other local workers to work during the day though states are expected to further clarify the rules in this regard. Private offices (at 33% staff strength) will be able to function even in red zones.   The norms set the framework for states, which can increase restrictions but cannot dilute them. The norms allow near-normalcy in green zones, now designated as areas with no fresh Covid-19 cases for 21 days, with the movement of taxis, autos and rickshaws. The same applies to orange zones where no cases have been detected for a fortnight but such movement is prohibited in red zones. Buses will also be allowed to operate at 50% capacity in green zones. In red zones, private four-wheelers with maximum two passengers in the back are permitted but for two-wheelers, no pillion riders are allowed.

The Grim Reaper, or at least a lawyer dressed up as death, made an appearance during a Florida TV station’s news report as the man was protesting the reopening of beaches near Panama City Beach.
 Daniel Uhlfelder said he was protesting in the Grim Reaper costume to show his displeasure of the beach opening during the spread of COVID-19.
 “I think it is premature that we open our beaches,” Uhlfelder told WMBB-TV. “I am a huge proponent of public beaches, and I have been fighting for that for years, but the danger of bringing all the people here to our area and spreading the virus, I think it will prolong the recovery.”
 Video of Uhlfelder’s appearance on WMBB has been seen by millions on social media on Friday.
 “Wow. Never thought I’d ever have a ‘viral’ moment like this,” WMBB reporter Faith Graham said. “For everyone asking, I am alive! The Grim Reaper did not hurt me by any means. I hope you all enjoyed! Covering a story like this was definitely interesting to say the least.”
 Two weeks ago, Gov. Ron DeSantis allowed municipalities and counties to decide to open public beaches. DeSantis was widely criticized in March for not closing the beaches during some of the busy Spring Break period, as many Florida beaches were crowded with tourists during the spread of the virus.
 “Do it in a good way. Do it in a safe way,” DeSantis said about opening the beaches on April 17.
 Uhlfelder’s protest stands in contrast with those happening at state capitols across the country, as a number of demonstrators, some of whom armed, have objected to governors ordering some non-essential businesses to remain closed.

LAWTON, Okla. (TNN) - "Because of your efforts to combat COVID-19, we are able to accomplish our mission to defend this nation,” said Col. Russell Driggers, the 80th FTW Commander. “To all the health care professionals and essential personnel thank you for your long hours, hard days and commitment to the fight.” If you live in Texoma, it’s likely you saw or at least heard the Sheppard Air Force Base aircrafts fly over hospitals from Lawton to Wichita Falls."Its a great opportunity for us to say thank you to everyone across the Texoma region. We are looking at all the medical professionals, first responders,” said Col. Clayton Bartels, the 80th FTW Vice Commander. "These are truly the warriors who have been putting the fight since this pandemic kicked off. So from the sky, we have the opportunity to say thanks,” said Col. Kenyon Bell, Escalation Commander at Sheppard AFB. Col. Bell said during this pandemic a lot has changed operations wise on base, and being able to adapt can be credited to these essential workers. "We can not do our mission at Sheppard if our health care professionals, essential to mission personnel who work out in the community don’t do theirs,” said Col. Bell. During the flyover, doctors, nurses and staff at CCMH, SWMC and United Regional were able to take a well-deserved break and watch these planes soar in their honor. "Having those individuals recognize our team, it’s just incredibly special,” said United Health Care President and CEO Phyllis Cowling. "They thanked us from the pilot down to the ground here so we could here it...That was really special,” said Chris Ward, the CCMH Chief Nursing Officer. That message before the flyover was relayed from the lead pilot Col. Russell Driggers, and he thanked these workers for their dedication, and bravery. "Thank you for your continued efforts. We know this fight wont be over for along time so keep your head, and keep doing what you do best,” said Col. Driggers. And even though this was an opportunity for the health care workers to be thanked, Cowling said more than that it showed true Texoma unity. "Health care workers, Sheppard, and the entire Texoma region, we are all in this together and together we’ve got this,” said Cowling.Friday morning, Altus Air Force Base’s Mighty 97th wowed the state with a massive flyover above the Oklahoma City Metro before heading to southwest Oklahoma. As it worked out, they flew right over our 7News studio before making their way through Lawton to salute health care workers... eventually doing the same for their neighbors in Altus.Copyright 2020 Texoma News Network.

Beside this, increasing concerns pertaining to the air quality, on the back of the rising levels of VOCs, especially in the developing countries is predicted to bode well for the growth of the VOC sensors and monitors market in the forthcoming years.
