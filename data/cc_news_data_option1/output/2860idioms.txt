Missing Otis Gardner's column
   
 Every Sunday we look forward to reading at least one conservative article that truly represents the majority of eastern NC values. So disappointed and disgruntled that Otis was omitted.
   
 Your newspaper repeatedly fails to recognize and cater to its readers and continually tries, unsuccessfully, to bend our minds toward liberalism. I have always despised attempts at brainwashing and propaganda pushed continually in my face. Please acknowledge that your ENC readers are mostly conservative and at least attempt to not appear to be so completely liberally biased. Even a balanced newspaper would be a welcome change and you would retain your customers.

 Maybe it's time for term limits
   
 According to a posting on FaceBook, Dianne Feinstein has been in government service for 60 years, I was able to verify 28 years in congress. Chuck Schumer has been in government service for 45 years, able to verify 22 years in congress. Maxine Waters for 47 years, 29 years in congress. Patrick Leahy 54 years, 26 in congress. Joe Biden 52 years, 44 in congress and eight as vice president. Nancy Pelosi 33 years, 30 in congress. President Trump has three years and all the problems in the world are his fault! The spin doctors are working overtime. Maybe it's time for term limits on congress. Think before you vote.

 Health and economic emergencies require that political partisanship be put aside
   
 Onslow County will likely lose $111,315,527 in COVID-19 federal emergency relief because of partisan politics.
   
 On May 15, the U.S. House passed H.R. 6800 -- The Heroes Act -- to provide federal stimulus money to state and local governments to offset emergency expenditures and income deficiencies due to COVID-19 illness and restrictions. The House vote was 208 to 199, along party lines. Nine (9) of North Carolina's Representatives (all Republicans) voted "Nay," with three (3) "Ayes," (all from Democratic Representatives.)
   
 Onslow County's emergency aid would be an estimated $74,210,351 for 2020 and $37,105,176 in 2021, based on population numbers from the most recent census figures as determined by the CRS, Census Bureau, and HUD. North Carolina's local governments would have received an estimated $8.9 billion overall. H.R. 6800 was received in the Senate on May 20 and has been read twice. It is unlikely, however, that the U.S. Senate, under Republican Mitch McConnell's leadership, will seriously consider a vote on the measure -- although he seems to be fine with sending millions of dollars to Russia for the same purpose.
   
 It is rare that we are able to hear our elected officials tell their individual deliberations for votes they cast for our constituent interests. I have received "party talking points" in response to every request for their individual reasoning -- and I do ask often. I recall when Senator Jesse Helms spoke of being "sick and tired" of political punditry and poor reasoning on the issues.
   
 Onslow's people are sick with the virus, and tired out by working to "try to make ends meet." We need relief for our county budgets. I feel sure our county commissioners and the county manager are doing their best in the current economic and health emergencies. Medicaid expansion might provide some relief, but an immediate infusion of over 74 million dollars in federal aid could be a benefit for our current ills. I hope that our citizen-constituents consider the partisanship problem when they hear their service requests denied due to "budget constraints."
   
 I hope to be wrong about the partisan-fractured Congress; that "The Heroes Act" will pass in the U.S. Senate and signed into law. Onslow County could use a break on the budget.

The blockbuster that Hollywood was counting on to jump-start a COVID-19 delayed summer movie season won't be busting blocks anytime soon. Christopher Nolan's sci-fi thriller _Tenet_, originally announced for a July 17 opening, and pushed back twice, has now been removed from the Warner Bros release calendar, in a major blow to film exhibitors.      "We will share a new 2020 release date imminently for _Tenet_ , Christopher Nolan's wholly original and mind-blowing feature," said Warner Bros. chairman Toby Emmerich in a statement.      Director Nolan — whose blockbusters _Inception, Dunkirk_ and the Batman _Dark Knight Trilogy_ have made billions on the big screen — has been adamant that his $200-million thriller would be the tent-pole that would hold up the summer movie-going tent.      When theater chains got open, he said, _Tenet_ would bring the crowds. But as it became clear that theater chains would not be fully open by this past weekend, the opening date started slipping, first to July 31, then to Aug. 12, and now to an as-yet-unspecified date later this year.      The Warner Bros. statement went on to say the studio would not be giving _Tenet_ a "traditional global day-and-date release" — industry-speak for opening all over the planet at once — though it didn't specify what a non- traditional release might look like      Speculation in the film industry has been that the studio might try premiering _Tenet_ overseas. Nolan's blockbusters have tended to do two-thirds of their business in foreign territories, and some major foreign markets are reopening as governments get the coronavirus under control, including South Korea, Japan, China, and some areas of Europe.      What box-office grosses might look like in a fragmented, here-and-there release is anyone's guess. In China and South Korea, cinemas have reopened with stringent social distancing protocols, and fewer screenings daily to allow for additional cleaning of theaters. An industry operating at, say, 30% of capacity, will not be turning out a lot of box-office records.      That will also be true at theaters in the U.S., where not quite one-fifth of the nation's multiplexes are currently open for business, and very few of those in urban areas. It would be unprecedented to premiere a major movie and not play in New York and Los Angeles on opening weekend, but...a lot of things are unprecedented right now.

Stone's pardon shows irony, corruption
   
 I turned on the TV [on July 11] to see breaking news that Trump had pardoned Roger Stone. In an interview, Stone thanked Trump for saving his life because he could have died in prison with Covid -19 going around. It is ironic that Covid-19 would probably not be so rampant if Trump had not been elected, and Stone would not be going to jail if he had not broken the law to help his buddy Trump get elected. During the broadcast, the so-called "liberal" media chose not to pursue the fact of the quid-pro-quo between Trump and Stone, i.e. that Trump is the first and only president in history ever to pardon a criminal who tampered with the election that put him in office. An American jury found this guy guilty in a fair trial and he should serve his time. Even Attorney General Barr agreed, although he did reduce the sentence from seven years down to 40 months. However, Trump still feared that Stone might talk, and that would be bad in an election year. Stone has done Trump a big favor by keeping his mouth shut so far, and Trump had to return the favor with a pardon. If this isn't corruption, then I don't know what is.

 Shocked by people, even police, not wearing masks
   
 In this day and age of mask wearing, I was shocked and dismayed to go to a local pharmacy in New Bern and within a half hour of waiting for a shot, I witnessed at least five customers come to the pharmacy not wearing masks. Most disheartening was seeing that two of those not wearing masks were uniformed police officers (whom I was told later were probably not local but from another county). While the rest of us were obeying the state's guidelines, these two officers were flaunting their disregard; talking up close to the masked workers at the pharmacy, sitting and yakking with each other, and paying absolutely no attention to social distancing. Several children also saw them; what kind of leadership example does that set? I chose not to call them out, but in hindsight, I almost wished I had. Leading by example, these days, seems to be a thing of the past.

The coronavirus pandemic has already given the Erie School District the resources to get a computer in the hands of every student, and now the crisis is also changing how the district buses its students, another area that has long been a target of reform.
   
 The Erie School District in 2020-21 will transport hundreds of its eligible elementary school students on the district's own fleet of 31 yellow buses rather than on Erie Metropolitan Transit Authority buses, as has long been the case.
   
 Instead of having it youngest students use district-provided passes to ride EMTA buses, the district will put those students on yellow buses, whose passengers are all students and whose pickup and drop-off points are more under district control.
   
 The shift in transportation is believed to be one of the most significant of its kind for the 11,000-student Erie School District in more than three decades and achieves a goal Erie schools Superintendent Brian Polito has pursued since he took over at the district three years ago.
   
 The district is reworking the locations of some of its special education classrooms to increase the capacity of the yellow buses and to make the change for Aug. 31, the first day of classes for district students. Special education students have been the primary passengers on the yellow buses.
   
 "I think this is one of the silver linings to the pandemic," Polito said of modifying the transportation plan. "It has us thinking about how we operate as a district."
   
 He said the shift to the yellow buses will allow the district to provide transportation, either on its own or through EMTA buses, to all students who need it during the pandemic. The district is putting 48 students on a yellow bus, rather than the maximum of 72, to abide by social distancing.
   
 ""Every student who wants to get to school can do so," Polito said.
   
 He said middle school students and high school students will continue to use EMTA buses, but that having all eligible elementary school students ride yellow buses represents a major development in addressing concerns about student safety and convenience. Yellow buses will pick up and drop off students in stops close to their homes.
   
 Polito included the updated busing arrangements in the state-required health and safety plan for reopening that he presented to the Erie School Board on July 7. The board on Tuesday will hold a special session to adopt the plan, which the district, like all the state's 500 school districts, must submit to the state Department of Education.
   
 The Erie School District's plan centers on a hybrid approach to instruction. Families can choose remote learning or in-person classes. The district switched to remote learning solely in March, when the state shut down schools due to the outbreak of COVID-19.
   
 The district is providing computers to all its students, or going "one-to- one," by using $2.6 million of the $6.8 million in federal aid it received through the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act. The district is buying Chromebook laptops for students in second through 12th grades and iPads for students in pre-kindergarten through first grade.
   
 Budget woes had prevented the school district from providing computers for its students, about 77% of whom are economically disadvantaged, according to state data, with many families lacking computers or internet access at home. The pandemic highlighted the disparity for technology resources, essential to remote learning, between the Erie School District and more affluent districts.
   
 The Erie School District is shifting to yellow buses without using coronavirus relief money. A rethinking of of the district's resources is driving the change.
   
 "We have the capacity to transport all these students," Polito said. "We just needed to get creative in how we do it."
   
 The shift could save the district money in its contract with EMTA but will also require the district to fill all it 31 bus driver positions -- 20 full- time drivers and 11 part-time drivers. The district has not filled all those posts in the past.
   
 Overall, moving all eligible elementary school students on to yellow buses "is the biggest plus to come out of the pandemic after the one-to-one," said Neal Brokman, the Erie School District's director of operations. "We won't be putting a kindergartner on an EMTA bus. It is a very big plus."
   
 The district in 2019-20 used its yellow buses to transport 827 students, mainly its special education students and parochial students whose transportation is also the district's responsibility, according to district records.
   
 The rest of the elementary students eligible for transportation -- those who live 1.5 miles or more from school, the maximum radius under state law -- have taken EMTA buses since around the mid-1980s, with EMTA creating customized "tripper" routes for those students.
   
 In 2019-20, a total of 3,264 Erie School District students, including 591 elementary school students, used EMTA buses to get to and from school. Using the EMTA buses and the yellow buses, the district in 2019-20 transported a total of 4,091 students. The rest walked to school or used their own transportation.
   
 Parents and others have continually asked the district to use yellow buses for all eligible elementary school students, a refrain the district particularly heard during the focus groups the district convened before and after consolidating schools for 2017-18.
   
 Potential costs and other factors complicated a switch to yellow buses until the district studied its busing operations anew in light of the pandemic. With social distancing precautions reducing the capacity of buses, the district examined how it could make its yellow buses available for more routes, allowing the buses to make more runs and carry more students.
   
 The district found a solution, Polito said, by restructuring the locations of its classrooms for special needs students, such as classrooms for autism support.
   
 The district in 2020-21 will move to more of a consortium model, Polito said, in which the resources for special needs students will be spread across three clusters of elementary schools that are close to one another, rather than just one school.
   
 The change, Polito said, will reduce the amount of time special education students must be on buses, which frees the yellow buses for more runs in the mornings and afternoons. He said the special education students will also ride the buses with students in traditional school district classes. And the special education students will ride with parochial school students, which the district said had been the case under the old system.
   
 The Erie School District has been contacting families of special education students about the revised busing arrangements. The district's intention is to change instruction as little as possible for those students, Brokman, said.
   
 "We do want to keep the education the same for the kids," he said.

Former Democratic gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum emerged Monday from self-imposed political exile with a social media post addressing depression and alcoholism after a March incident involving a man who reportedly overdosed in a South Beach hotel room.
 According to a police report, Gillum, who was in the room where suspected crystal meth was found, was “unable to communicate with officers due to his inebriated state.” After the March 12 episode, Gillum announced that he was going to a rehabilitation facility to deal with alcohol abuse.
 In an 11-minute video posted Monday on Instagram, Gillum --- once viewed as a rising star on the national political scene --- spoke about the impact of losing the 2018 governor’s race to Republican Ron DeSantis.
 “I had totally underestimated the impact that losing the race for governor had had on my life, and on the way that those impacts started to show up in every aspect of my life,” Gillum, the father of three children, said. “It was a constant reminder of failure and my own personal failures. … It was a reminder that I had let so many people down.”
 After narrowly losing the race, Gillum went on to work as a political analyst for CNN. But he said in Monday’s video that depression “became far too much for me to keep down.”
 Gillum noted that his father also suffered from alcoholism and died of complications related to “that deadly addiction.”
 State campaign finance records show that the political committee associated with Gillum’s gubernatorial run has spent about $1 million on legal services since the November 2018 election.
 In Monday’s video, Gillum urged other people struggling with alcoholism or depression to seek help. Gillum, who will turn 41 on Saturday, did not elaborate on his plans for the future. But he told his Instagram followers to stay tuned.
 “I hope that I’ll be able to share more layers that I’m developing and enveloping. I’m doing a lot of writing these days. I’m trying to put on paper a lot of what I’m experiencing right now,” Gillum said, adding that he hoped his writing would not just be cathartic for him but would also “help to serve as healing for others.”
 The former Tallahassee mayor also praised his wife, R. Jai, calling her “a woman who knows everything that I am, and everything that I am not, and she chooses to love me.”

Labour shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds said the pay rise was "good news" but claimed it would not make up for a "decade of real-terms pay cuts" for frontline workers.
 TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady called for social care workers to join the ranks of those being offered a pay rise.
 "These rises are welcome, but there's still a long way to go to restore pay after a decade of real terms cuts," she said.
 "Many public sector workers, like job centre staff and local government workers, aren't getting these rises. They deserve a decent pay settlement too.
 "And the government should urgently announce a pay rise for social care workers, who put their lives on the line to care for others during this pandemic."
 Unison assistant general secretary Christina McAnea called for "more resources for local authorities" so council staff and social care workers could also be entitled to a "decent wage increase".

In other business, the commission will go over the most recent plans for two roundabouts, one at the intersection of Canal Road and Glynco Parkway and another at Kings Way and Frederica Road on St. Simons Island.
 Its positioning close to the McKinnon St. Simons Island Airport and input from the Sea Island Co., which owns part of the land the roundabout would sit on, delayed the project. Most recent plans include elements of another design done by Sea Island, Brunson said.
 “They’re a partner in this thing,” he explained. “We want to be in business with them in putting this thing together.”
 Part of the deal, detailed at a past commission meeting, is that Sea Island will handle landscaping at the intersection, which directly serves the Lodge at Sea Island.
 At the mainland intersection, commission Chairman Mike Browning said the entrance to Notting Hill subdivision stood in the way. It is very close to the intersection of Glynco and Canal and posed a challenge to any designs they came up with.
 “The question is, can we move (the road closer to Notting Hill) and work something out, or do we need to come up with something else?” Browning said.
 The meeting will be held virtually at 2 p.m. and broadcast to the county’s YouTube and Facebook pages.

Gaston Christian School recently introduced its plan to resume in-person learning on Aug. 13 despite recent spikes in COVID-19 cases locally.
   
 Students and staff must follow a number of health and safety measures, including temperature checks, social distancing, frequent hand washing and thorough disinfecting. However, parents with students in fourth through 12th grade can opt in to stay-at-home learning through live and recorded videos.
   
 Students in the third grade and below don't have that option because children are less likely to transmit the virus and children rely heavily on adults to learn, according to Gaston Christian School administrators.
   
 "There is a bond they make with their teachers and they make with their classmates that you just can't do from a live [stream] session," said Gaston Christian Middle School Principal Jon Huitt, whose three kids are in the first, third and fifth grade.
   
 "The lower you go in age, the less independent the learner is. Anything virtual or online requires more and more independence in that student," Gaston Christian Middle School Principal Joel Uecker added.
   
 Gaston Christian School administrators are also requiring students - except for students in the fifth grade or below and those with respiratory and alike issues - to wear cloth face coverings "as feasible," especially where social distancing is most difficult. Teachers will wear either a face covering or face shields.
   
 Students are allowed to take off their masks while sitting at their desk during class or while they're eating lunch. A pre-packaged lunch will be delivered to students, who will eat in their classrooms, outside or in the cafeteria while social distancing.
   
 Chapel services at Gaston Christian School will continue, but live singing will cease. Instead, chapel leaders will use pre-recorded music.
   
 "That's because when you're singing, that's the most susceptibility of putting particles in the air," said Head of Gaston Christian School Marc Stout. "We just want to eliminate that variable from the scenario."
   
 The administration is still working through details for operating special classes, like band, chorus and physical education, following discussions with those teachers, according to Uecker.
   
 Since Gov. Roy Cooper announced his decision to let public schools continue remote instruction or reopen under strict guidelines, classes at Gaston Christian School have been filling up fast. Stout believes parents spreading the word about Gaston Christian School's plan has kindled the interest of families not satisfied with Cooper's decision.
   
 "Our phones have been ringing off the hook," he said. "We -- being a private school -- will be a great opportunity for those families."
   
 Stout expects between 825 and 850 students will enroll at Gaston Christian School. The school's current capacity -- with all COVID-19 measures in place -- is 950, Stout said.
   
 Gaston Christian School plans to address questions from parents and issue clarifications during a Zoom meeting on Aug. 4 at 6:30 p.m.

“I have lived with Neuropathy for many years and it has been gradually getting worse. I continued having no results with the treatment I had been doing but felt like I had no other options,” he said.
 That was until he heard about a local chiropractor offering cutting edge treatments for Neuropathy that he decided to seek help once more.
 “My wife read about Wellman Family Healthcare and kept encouraging me to make an appointment. I reluctantly called and made the appointment because I felt I had nothing to lose at this point,” he said.
 The Wellmans, Dr. Amber Wellman and Dr. Jason Wellman, have received countless hours of training and are proficient in treating Neuropathy. They have developed programs that offer relief to so many of their patients.
 To do this, the practice offers the latest in procedures and techniques, including low level light therapy (LLLT), which was discovered by NASA and used for treating wounds in space.
 “The low level light therapy creates a process called angiogenesis,” Dr. Amber Wellman explained. “Angiogenesis means ‘new blood vessels.’ It’s like watering a plant. The more LLLT a nerve gets, the more it repairs itself, just like a plant would by getting more water, sunlight and nutrients.”
 It’s this knowledge and access to high tech capabilities that have benefited patients. When Tate arrived for his first appointment, he knew he had made the right decision.
 “I was shocked at the in-depth exam Dr. Wellman performed on my first visit. I immediately felt like I was in good hands.” he added. “It was very disappointing to find out I have 70 percent sensory loss in my legs and feet. It had become ‘normal’ to me and I didn’t realize it had progressed so much.”
 Dr. Amber Wellman accessed his condition and created customized treatment plan aimed at increasing blood flow, decreasing pain signals and repairing previous damage.

Disha Patani and Tiger Shroff are amongst the top stars in the industry. Disha Patani has been giving her fans a treat as she is super active on social media and has been uploading the best videos ever! It's no surprise that both Disha and Tiger are fitness enthusiasts but they did often give their diet a miss and step out for a fun meal before lockdown! The couple has been tight-lipped about their relationship. However, their constant lunch and dinner dates, social media banter and off-screen chemistry give it away! Disha also shares a great bond with Tiger's sister Krishna and their camaraderie is adorable on Instagram! When Tiger Shroff graced the couch on Karan Johar's chat show, the star was quizzed about dating Disha and he said that they are just good friends, likeminded people and enjoy each other's company. The 'Heropanti' actor was quizzed in an interview regarding the same. The actor reportedly said that they are seen together at restaurants for dinner and coffee. She is a dear friend and they do go out together. Beyond that, let people speculate. Tiger said that some amount of speculation is good. While Tiger Shroff, in an interview, revealed that he is taking it slow with Disha, the Bharat actress said that she is trying hard to impress Tiger and make things go beyond the zone of friendship. When Disha Patani was asked about it, the actress said in an interview, "He's too slow motion, man. I've been trying to impress him and I keep telling him that. I have learnt gymnastics and I've done a film where I'm taking a flip through a fire ring. He's still not impressed. What more can I do?" She added that she wants to be more than just great friends with Tiger Shroff, but her Baaghi 2 co-star is hard to impress. "He's too slow. Someone has to break the ice and speak up. He is a great friend but I want things to get a little more than being just great friends. I'm trying my best to impress him but he's just not agreeing," added Disha Patani. However, they have often been spotted together on various occasions at their stylish best. Here's a throwback to the time the lovebirds stepped out in twinning white outfits!
