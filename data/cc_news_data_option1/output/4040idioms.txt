 MOSCOW, Oct 8 (Reuters) - Russian pharmaceutical company R-Pharm is working to retool rheumatoid arthritis drug, olokizumab, to treat COVID-19 patients with moderate to severe infections, its Chief Medical Officer Mikhail Samsonov told Reuters in an interview.
 Final results of a 372-person placebo-controlled, randomised clinical trial, are due to be published in late October or early November, Samsonov said, but the drug has been included in national guidelines for treating patients with moderate COVID-19 infections and early signs are encouraging.
 Other drugmakers' attempts to re-purpose rheumatoid arthritis drugs for COVID-19 have had mixed results. Sanofi´s Kevzara has failed in a trial while Roche´s Actemra was shown to reduce the need for ventilation in patients.
 Belgium's UCB, the initial developer of olokizumab, sold a development and marketing license for the drug to R-Pharm in 2013.
 R-Pharm's move is another sign Russia is pushing hard to take a global lead in the race to fight the COVID-19 pandemic that has claimed more than a million lives.
 It is already exporting its COVID-19 tests and has clinched several international deals for supplies of its Sputnik-V vaccine.
 Last month, Russia approved R-Pharm's Coronavair drug to treat mild and moderate COVID-19 cases. The approval of the prescription drug followed the green light for another Russian COVID-19 drug, Avifavir, in May.
 'CYTOKINE STORM'
 R-Pharm started work on retooling olokizumab in February, when reports of growing cases and deaths worldwide began to appear, and completed recruitment for the trial in June, Samsonov said.
 Olokizumab belongs to a class of drugs called interleukin-6 inhibitors that are being tried to help regulate a dangerous over-reacting to the virus by the body's immune system called "cytokine storm."
 "What we saw in the clinical trial and in clinical practice is that when we inject the monoclonal antibody, olokizumab, within a few hours the temperature is going down, oxygenation is growing," Samsonov said.
 The benefit of R-Pharm's drug is that a single 64mg dose, administered by injection, binds directly to circulating cytokines and helps to suppress hyperinflammation and prevent the development of serious lung damage, he added.
 The speed of Russia's vaccine rollout, which the Russian government approved for use before completing large-scale human trials, has elicited concern from scientists about its safety and efficacy.
 Samsonov said that although olokizumab is being used in some clinics across Russia already, it was still far from widespread use and that safety was a primary concern.
 "COVID is not universal, patients react differently. For some patients certain combinations work and are more effective and safe, for others it may be different," he said.

 LONDON, Oct 8 (Reuters) - European government bond yields fell on Thursday, as rising coronavirus cases in Europe and longer-term uncertainty kept sentiment subdued, even as equity markets were lifted by renewed hopes for U.S. fiscal stimulus.
 Germany's benchmark Bund yield was down 2 basis points at -0.513%, while Portugal's 10-year yield hit its lowest since March at 0.203%. Italy's 10-year yield fell 3 bps, hitting its lowest since September 2019 at 0.761%.
 Euorpean Central Bank (ECB) vice-president Luis de Guindos, commenting on "subdued" inflation expectations in the euro zone, said that the central bank has to use all the tools at its disposal.
 Minutes from the ECB's September meeting showed that policymakers argued for a "free hand" to fight the economic damage caused by the coronavirus pandemic.
 Daniel Lenz, rates strategist at DZ Bank, said underlying uncertainty in markets was keeping core yields down.
 "ECB impact is so big that in general the spreads have a continuous downward trend and yields remain on a very low level," he said.
 "I don´t see much movement for the German yield going higher than -0.50%," he said, citing the U.S. presidential elections, Brexit uncertainty and rising COVID-19 infections in Europe, which have surged in countries including France, Germany and Poland.
 This followed renewed hopes on Wednesday for a U.S. fiscal stimulus package which had driven euro zone yields higher, while in the United States, Treasury prices fell and the yield curve steepened.
 The spread between German and U.S. 10-year yields was 129 bps, close to its widest since March.
 "It is still closer to crisis levels than to more normal levels, but the path that the spread is on is an auspicious one. What we want to see here is a classic U.S. recovery that helps to lift the likes of Europe in the same direction," ING rates strategists said in a note to clients.
 "The bond market is in the early phase of pricing in that exact likelihood. But we still have some way to go." (Reporting by Elizabeth Howcroft; Editing by Larry King and Alexander Smith)

Modena, a city referred to as "the breadbasket" in Italy's Emilia-Romagna region, is where Parmigiano-Reggiano hails from, as does mortadella in its capital city of Bologna. But, specifically in Modena, what is universally recognized is its production of balsamic vinegar.      On a visit to Modena, I entered a room filled with rows of barrels that dated back to the 16th and 17th centuries, and where the aroma of balsamic vinegar permeated the air in a most welcoming way. I was here for a tour through Giuseppe Giusti's museum and barrel room. The Giusti family began producing balsamic vinegar in 1605.      "We've been paying taxes here for more than 400 years," Claudio Stefani Giusti, CEO, says with a laugh.      Giusti is a 17th-generation producer in Modena, the undisputed epicenter of Lamborghini, Maserati and Alfa Romeo. As Modena's oldest producers, the Giusti family has created an on-site, 10-room Museum of Balsamic Vinegar, full of artifacts and memorabilia. It is here that Giusti explains balsamic vinegar's humble beginnings.      "Balsamic vinegar is an old product -- typical and traditional but not naturally occurring. It's the result of the fruit of the region combined with the people of the region.      "Just imagine picking the grapes and extracting their juice. In Modena, wine made from local lambrusca grapes is not particularly good, and wine made from trebbiano grapes is simply 'not bad.' So, the grape juice we extract is concentrated by being cooked down. The result is saba, or mosto, a sweet-ish condiment to enhance the taste of food."      As there was no refrigeration in those early days, the leftover mosto slowly oxidized in a process called acetobacter, which removes the liquid's natural alcohol. The resulting syrupy, sweet/sour vinegar -- known as balsamic since the 1800s -- tastes better and better as it ages.      The word balsamic is based on the Latin word balsam, or "to feel better." One legend has it that a duke hoping for favor from Rome sent a barrel of balsamic to the Pope, who claimed to prefer this gift to the 100 horses presented to him by another area duke.      In Modena today, tradition dictates that when a girl is born, a row of vinegar barrels is set up. When the girl gets married, those well-aged barrels become her dowry.      In 1863, one of Giuseppe Giusti's forebears presented a paper during a trade show in Modena, defining balsamic vinegar and how to make it. He specified which types of grapes to use, and even what type of wood to make the aging barrels. At that time, the correct barrels had to be 20 years old, and the vinegar needed to live in the barrels a minimum of two years.      Paraphrased through generations, his instructions were to use juniper wood or a non-aromatic wood such as mulberry in the beginning, and oak at the end. In the middle, use cherry or chestnut. It's important that the vinegar tastes of all the different woods that house it. Giusti explains that after 15 years the vinegar begins to get good, and after 30 years much better. After 50 years, it deserves the name balsamic.      This 150-year-old trade show speech is still known and widely quoted today as The Giusti Recipe. Today, balsamic vinegar can be made in just 60 days. Of course, the longer the product sits in the barrels, the more special it becomes.      In the Giusti family barrel rooms in Modena, no barrel is less than 100 years old. In fact, some of the barrels occasionally require renovation.      "If a barrel falls apart," says Giusti, "you have to build a new barrel around it, so as not to disturb the product."      The price of good balsamic vinegar begins at $20 and can range upward to $300, but much like fine wine, there is often no real way to determine if the liquid inside the bottle is superior or not.      "In the final analysis, balsamic is a condiment," says Giusti. "You can classify it one way or the other, but you just never know its quality until you taste it."

Now from the senator Joseph Biden Biden opposed that decision. Whatever the vice president claiming the administration has done clearly it hasn't worked. When you're looking at over 2101000. Dead bodies and our country. The moderator pressing the vice president to head of the corona virus task force about what appears to have been a super spreader event at the White House many of the people who were at that advances and actually were tested for corona virus. Then it was an outdoor event which all of our scientists regularly and routinely advised. The topic later turning to abortion the Supreme Court nominee Amy coney Baird's confirmation hearing only days away. I'm pro life. I'm apologize for. And this is another one of those cases were there such a dramatic contrast. I will always fight for a woman's right to make a decision about her own body it should be her decision and not that Donald Trump it. And the vice president Michael pence. With 26 days until the election new polls show the president losing ground in several key states. ABC's Tom Thomas breaks down the numbers chill Biden still leading according to these polls. In Pennsylvania though North Carolina and Arizona Joseph Biden has increased its lead. By one percentage point. You may be at home sane one percentage point who cares it's incredibly important we look at states like Michigan Wisconsin Pennsylvania the president won by less than a percentage point. So what happened in Florida. Joseph Biden since the last debate has increased his lead by two percentage points in fact a poll just out today shows independence. Breaking for Joseph Biden by twenty points that's pretty big news that sticks for the election back at the debate pence argued a Biden administration would be a disaster for the economy while Harris claimed the trumpet administration's policies are more harmful to most American families. Joseph Biden says democracies on the ballot make no mistake about it Susan. And the American economy the American comeback is on the ballot Joseph Biden believes you measure the health and the strength of America's economy. Based on the health and the strength of the American worker. And the American family. And other big moment was when Mike Pence attacked Joseph Biden for his handling of the Swine Flu. Back in 2009. That was during the Obama administration went sixty million Americans were infected. Compared to seven point five million for the corona virus now and while fact checkers were quick to point out that those numbers from pens may be correctly note that the corona virus has been far deadlier.

But Whelan's success spoke for itself. When she became CEO in 2015, SoulCycle had just 11 studios. By May 2020 it had 99 in three countries. SoulCycle revenue, reported as $36 million in 2012, climbed during Whelan's tenure as COO and CEO to an estimated $250 million last year, according to two insiders with knowledge of the company's finances. The cycling company also hired 2,000 people during Whelan's tenure. SoulCycle declined to comment on its revenue.
 Whelan said it was "unfair" to suggest she was "scared" of Spevak.
 "My role was to deliver against an aggressive growth mandate while maintaining the culture and magic of our brand and community. These two goals were at times in real conflict with one another, especially in light of the speed with which we were expected to grow," she said. "I did my job, which is why the early summer of 2019 was an all-time high for the brand."
 A 2018 study published in the Journal of Management found that CEOs who are women are more likely to be dismissed from their roles than men -- even when their company is performing well.
 Which might explain Whelan's work ethic.
 Whelan stated publicly that "the idea of work-life balance is not really something I believe in" -- and she expected her employees to adhere to the same philosophy, several former staffers said.
 "It was the norm to be available at any and all hours of the day, weekends very much included," the former staffer who worked closely with the C-suite said. "The hours were extremely intense, and everyone was expected to answer emails within two hours at the most."
 In August 2019, Whelan told Gary Gaines, SoulCycle's former senior vice president of global operations and studio experience, that "paternity leave is for pussies," according to allegations in a lawsuit filed against SoulCycle by Jordan Kafenbaum, a former executive who had managed talent.

 This year, the event will be a drive-thru style.
 “This is certainly a different year and as much as we love the closeness and energy that comes from filling up the Civic Center with food, music, and people, we are unable to do so this year for obvious reasons in light of the pandemic,” read a post on the event’s Facebook page.
 The event will take place Nov. 10 at the Civic Center on Jackson Hill. Ticket holders will receive a handmade bowl and a dry soup packet to prepare at home. Tickets will go on sale mid-October and be limited to 200 tickets total. Tickets will be $25 and proceeds benefit Rome Action Ministries.
 Tickets are on sale now at the Last Stop Gift Shop on Jackson Hill.

ISLAMABAD (AP) — The Afghan Taliban on Thursday welcomed a tweet from President Donald Trump in which he promised to have the last of U.S. troops out of Afghanistan by Christmas.
 If that withdrawal happens, it would be months ahead of schedule and the tweet made no reference to a Taliban promise to fight terrorist groups — a previous pre-requisite for an American withdrawal.
 America's exit from Afghanistan after 19 years was laid out in an agreement Washington reached with the Taliban in February. However, that agreement said U.S. troops would be out of Afghanistan in 18 months, provided the Taliban honored a commitment to fight terrorist groups, with most attention seemingly focused on the Islamic State group's affiliate in the country.
 Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahed said Trump's statement was welcome and he considered it a positive step for the implementation of the peace agreement between the U.S. and the Taliban.
 The Taliban are “committed to the contents of the agreement and hope for good and positive relations with all countries, including the U.S, in the future,” he said.
 Trump’s surprise tweet late Wednesday came as the Taliban and the Afghan government-appointed negotiating team are holding historic peace talks in Doha, Qatar.

Three types of joy
 In my book, "The Gravity of Joy," I identify multiple kinds of joy that can be expressed even in today's troubled times.
 Retrospective joy comes in vividly recalling a previous experience of unspeakable joy. For example, we can imagine in our minds an occasion when we helped someone else, or someone unexpectedly helped us, a time we felt deeply loved … the moment we saw our child for the first time. We can close our eyes and meditate on the memory, even walk through the details with someone else or in a journal and, often, experience that joy again, sometimes even more acutely.
 There is a kind of joy, too, that is redemptive, restorative -- resurrection joy. It is the feeling that follows things that are broken getting repaired, things that we thought were dead coming back to life. This kind of joy can be found in apologizing to someone we have hurt, or the feeling that follows recommitting ourselves to sobriety, a marriage, or a dream we feel called to.
 Futuristic joy comes from rejoicing that we will again glimpse meaning, beauty, or goodness, and seemingly against all odds feel that they are connected to our very life. This type of joy can be found, for example, through singing in a religious service, gathering at a protest demanding change or imagining a hope we have being realized.

By preventing contact between the citizens and the young police officers we indubitably prevented clashes and casualties. During the radio show I received information on the goings-on in Belgrade. What I feared the most was bloodshed and street clashes.

Russian pharmaceutical company R-Pharm is working to retool rheumatoid arthritis drug, olokizumab, to treat COVID-19 patients with moderate to severe infections, its Chief Medical Officer Mikhail Samsonov told Reuters in an interview.
 Final results of a 372-person placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial, are due to be published in late October or early November, Samsonov said, but the drug has been included in national guidelines for treating patients with moderate COVID-19 infections and early signs are encouraging.
 Other drugmakers' attempts to re-purpose rheumatoid arthritis drugs for COVID-19 have had mixed results. Sanofi's Kevzara has failed in a trial while Roche's Actemra was shown to reduce the need for ventilation in patients.
 Belgium's UCB, the initial developer of olokizumab, sold a development and marketing license for the drug to R-Pharm in 2013.
 R-Pharm's move is another sign Russia is pushing hard to take a global lead in the race to fight the COVID-19 pandemic that has claimed more than a million lives.
 It is already exporting its COVID-19 tests and has clinched several international deals for supplies of its Sputnik-V vaccine.
 Last month, Russia approved R-Pharm's Coronavair drug to treat mild and moderate COVID-19 cases. The approval of the prescription drug followed the green light for another Russian COVID-19 drug, Avifavir, in May.
 'CYTOKINE STORM'
 R-Pharm started work on retooling olokizumab in February, when reports of growing cases and deaths worldwide began to appear, and completed recruitment for the trial in June, Samsonov said.
 Olokizumab belongs to a class of drugs called interleukin-6 inhibitors that are being tried to help regulate a dangerous over-reacting to the virus by the body's immune system called "cytokine storm."
 "What we saw in the clinical trial and in clinical practice is that when we inject the monoclonal antibody, olokizumab, within a few hours the temperature is going down, oxygenation is growing," Samsonov said.
 The benefit of R-Pharm's drug is that a single 64mg dose, administered by injection, binds directly to circulating cytokines and helps to suppress hyperinflammation and prevent the development of serious lung damage, he added.
 The speed of Russia's vaccine rollout, which the Russian government approved for use before completing large-scale human trials, has elicited concern from scientists about its safety and efficacy.
 Samsonov said that although olokizumab is being used in some clinics across Russia already, it was still far from widespread use and that safety was a primary concern.
 "COVID is not universal, patients react differently. For some patients certain combinations work and are more effective and safe, for others it may be different," he said.

SoulCycle has been refusing to accept its own gift cards for weeks and has taken to selling idle bikes from its studios online. "They need cash," the SoulCycle insider said.
 Meanwhile, the fear of bankruptcy is ever present for some, especially after a spin-studio competitor, FlyWheel, filed for Chapter 11 last month. The former corporate employee said that "could never happen" at SoulCycle because Equinox would swoop in and save the company. But other insiders interviewed are less confident, citing SoulCycle's mounting debts and idle studios, which a bankruptcy could allow a big company to restructure.
 The SoulCycle spokesperson dismissed any speculation about a bankruptcy filing.
 Despite the bumpy road ahead, many riders remain faithful, eagerly awaiting the arrival of their home bikes, which began shipping in May, and signing up for distanced cycling classes at the reopened studios.
 But with some top employees on the run and others questioning SoulCycle's leadership and values, many current and former employees say the Equinox-led company has lost its identity.
 "Decisions at SoulCycle are driven by the Equinox and Related teams," the former member of SoulCycle's leadership team said. "The notion that SoulCycle is an independent company is completely false. It is now just part of a corporate machine."
 Ruth Zukerman, the first SoulCycle instructor and cofounder, said: "SoulCycle came from a place of passion and vulnerability and authenticity. This is 1,000% about the big corporate success of spin getting away from those grass roots."

Amazon's ascension into a retail behemoth has long prompted competitors to adopt new e-commerce and fulfillment strategies. But in 2020, during a pandemic that has upended both brick-and-mortar and online shopping, the Seattle-based giant's sway over the retail calendar itself is more apparent than ever.
 Amazon has moved its Prime Day sales event this year to October 13 and 14 because of the coronavirus. Prime Day is normally held annually around July 15. However, earlier in the summer, leaked emails from Amazon employees revealed that the sales event would be delayed until at least October 5 as a result of the pandemic.
 Target has so far followed in its competitor's lead, moving its Deal Days to the same dates, with Best Buy also committing to offering deals over the two- day period. Meanwhile, Walmart will host its Big Save event between October 11 and October 15. More retailers are likely to follow suit in scheduling sales events on or around Prime Day's mid-October kickoff.
 Even as retailers double down on e-commerce in 2020 in the face of logistical tangles and fears over in-store crowds during the holiday season, it's long been clear that Amazon's gravitational pull has altered the tides of the retail sphere. Last year's Target Deal Days, as an example, also took place on July 15 and 16, the same dates as Amazon's Prime Day. Walmart, not to be outdone, offered thousands of deals between July 14 and July 16.

Basseterre, St. Kitts, October 07, 2020 (SKNIS): As St. Kitts and Nevis prepares to reopen its borders to international commercial flights and travelers from October 31, 2020, the general public is strongly encouraged to continue to adhere to all COVID-19 health and safety protocols that were implemented to keep citizens and residents safe from the spread of the Coronavirus. “In preparation for the imminent opening of our borders, we have insisted that our citizens and residents comply with all health protocols especially the wearing of masks in public, frequent hand washing, physical and social distancing and we encourage our citizens and residents to avoid crowds and areas of heavy congestion,” said Prime Minister Dr. the Honourable Timothy Harris on October 06 edition of ‘Leadership Matters’, a virtual forum on ZIZ TV.Prime Minister Harris said that the Federation has come “a long way in its successful management of COVID-19 cases” and as a nation designated by the US- based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as a very low-risk destination, citizens and residents should continue to ensure that all protocols are followed as such practices will redound to the benefit of everyone. “These practices have to become second nature to us as we work to protect ourselves, our families, our friends and loved ones. Given that all our cases of COVID-19 to date are travel-related or imported, strict compliance with the health protocols is the only way to contain the spread of the virus thereby minimizing any strain on our small health system and loss of employment and productivity due to quarantine, isolation or hospitalization,” Dr. Harris added.Practicing proper hygiene and caring for one’s health have always been emphasized by health officials and other key stakeholders. Citizens and residents have always been encouraged to follow several hygienic precautionary practices such as frequently washing hands, avoiding touching eyes, nose and mouth and practising respiratory hygiene such as covering one’s mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when one coughs or sneezes. The used tissue should then be disposed of immediately in a waste bin. Very early on the government implemented measures to ensure the safety of citizens and residents. On March 25, 2020, the government closed the borders to all commercial airline flights to continue protecting citizens and residents against COVID-19 (Novel Coronavirus). However, flights for medical emergencies and International Air cargo and cargo by seafaring vessels were exempted to maintain connectivity and enable the Federation to import much-needed commodities such as food, fuel, medical supplies and equipment. To this day, the government and key stakeholders continue to play their part to ensure that every citizen and resident is protected against the spread of the virus.

 MANILA, Oct 8 (Reuters) - Worried that remote schooling could become a struggle, a local authority in the Philippines has set up a makeshift call center staffed by dozens of teachers to make sure students don't fall behind in class.
 The temporary call center opened in the capital Manila on Monday staffed by 70 people who have been busy answering hundreds of daily queries by phone, email and instant messenger, as students get to grips with virtual learning.
 "Quality education must continue. Just because there is an ongoing pandemic the quality of learning shouldn't suffer," said Ferdinand Delgado, team leader of the support program.
 "This program was made to strengthen the government's efforts to help students with their education."
 Schools across the Philippines have been closed since March to contain the spread of the coronavirus, which has infected more than 330,000 people locally, with over 6,000 deaths.
 President Rodrigo Duterte has vowed not to reopen schools until a COVID-19 vaccine is available.
 Some 50 teachers and 20 substitute teachers at the support program have been trained by call center supervisors to handle student inquiries, most of which have so far been about maths or science.
 The Philippines itself has been dubbed the "call center of the world," employing more than a million people in its Business Process Outsourcing industry, serving international companies with customers worldwide.
 "This program is very important for the students because they cannot always easily reach out to their school teachers," said maths teacher, Ailene Almoite.
 "More often than not, parents are also unsure about the lessons given to the students and are unable to help them." (Writing by Martin Petty Editing by Gareth Jones)

Israeli technology company Cellebrite will stop selling its services to customers in Hong Kong and China, the company announced on Wednesday.
 The change comes after new US regulations restricting technology and other exports, meant to curb Beijing's acquisition of technology under civilian pretences that would then be used by its military and for surveillance purposes.
 Cellebrite CEO Yossi Carmil said the company "empowers law enforcement agencies and enterprises to make our communities safer by providing solutions that help lawfully acquire digital evidence in criminal investigations and civil proceedings."
 But Hong Kong pro-democracy activists said Cellebrite was used by the Hong Kong Police Forces to hack into their phones, and a document from the Hong Kong police backed up their account.
 Joshua Wong, a leading activist whose phone was hacked , joined a call from Israeli human rights lawyer Eitay Mack in July for the Israeli Defense Ministry and Economy Ministry to block Cellebrite from exporting to Hong Kong. Following the June 30, 2020 "National Security Law," in which Beijing essentially put Hong Kong under Chinese Communist Party law and outlawed all political activity, the activists argued that Cellebrite's system is a dual- use security product "used to inflict terror on the city residents."
 That call was cosigned by 37 Israeli human rights activists, who said the Cellebrite system was used to hack into 4,000 Hong Kong citizens' phones. An online petition calling on the company to stop working with Hong Kong Police gathered over 36,000 signatures.
 Mack said on Thursday that he was very happy to hear Cellebrite would stop selling its products to China and Hong Kong. The court date for his petition to block the company's sales to China and Hong Kong was meant to be in March 2021.
 "Better late than never," he said. "It's good that Cellebrite chose the morally and legally right thing to do, without the court's intervention."
 The attorney pointed out that US law requires Cellebrite not only to stop selling to China and Hong Kong, but to shut down the existing devices, as well.
 Mack and a group of activists filed a petition to the Tel Aviv District Court last month to block Cellebrite from selling its product to Russia, which they say is using it for political persecution.
 He has petitioned the courts to stop the company's sales to Venezuela and Belarus, as well.
 The Israeli data-extraction company also sold technology to US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and to the Saudi Arabian Justice Ministry, according to media reports.

 Oct 8 (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp said on Thursday it was launching a new low-cost loan product for checking customers who may be pressed for cash.
 Balance Assist, which will be available beginning in January, allows clients to borrow up to $500 for a flat $5 fee, and repay the amount over a three- month period. Customers need to have a checking account with the bank for at least one year to be eligible for the loan.
 Earlier this year U.S. regulators urged banks to strongly consider extending short-term, small-dollar loans to struggling people and businesses to help them make ends meet during the coronavirus pandemic. Banks largely abandoned the practice in recent years amid regulatory scrutiny.
 "Financial health has never been more challenging for the millions of consumers who experience short-term cash gaps due to income volatility or unexpected expenses," said Jennifer Tescher, CEO of Financial Health Network. "We need more institutions to offer small-dollar credit, and so it is encouraging that Bank of America has developed an alternative to overdraft and payday loans that is safe, transparent, and affordable, with the real potential to advance financial health."
