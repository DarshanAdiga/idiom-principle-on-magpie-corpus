Nothing reflects status and personality like a watch. Owning a classic timepiece is the epitome of sophistication and luxury. A great watch reflects the inspiration and character of its designer. While many watch companies offer run of the mill designs, few are willing to push the envelope and offer their customers the exclusivity they are looking for. Vincent Michael Tome, popularly known as Vince Tome, is the founder of Vincenzo Collection. He is famous for _designing_ opulent and stylish timepieces that have redefined luxury.


  V​ince's motivation is all about delivering exceptional quality timepieces for those who aren't afraid to chase the lifestyle of their dreams. "When you are designing a watch, you have to design it with the wearer in mind. Are they powerful? Do they hold influence? You want to reflect that?" says Vince. "That is what makes watch design such a rare art form. It's all about striking the perfect balance with each design."


  "​A watch is the final piece of a great look," explains Vince. "You should never compromise in this regard." Vince takes his designs very seriously. He knows that designing an exclusive watch is an art form that cannot be mass- produced. Maintaining the idea that watches are often the defining part of anyone's look, Vince focuses on styles that convey a simple intricacy lending to a powerful statement.


  Born in Royal Oak, MI, Vince now resides in Florida, where he runs his fashion and accessories company, Vincenzo Collection. "I have curated and created a collection specifically for entrepreneurs, influencers, athletes, and other power players," says Vince. "This pushes us to offer cutting edge designs with a modern and minimalist flair. It's about crafting an artistic masterpiece." While the collection includes items ranging from luxurious accessories to his world-famous smart wallet, Vince's watches are the most sought after best-sellers.


  Vincenzo Collection is not only turning heads, but it has become a household name. The company is crafting exclusive pieces that are built to last. With well-crafted bands, gold accents, and sleek designs, Vincenzo Collection presents watch design in its purest form.

LOS ANGELES -- George Springer put on another postseason show at Dodger Stadium on Tuesday, moving the Houston Astros one game away from their fourth consecutive American League Championship Series.


  Springer hit two home runs and the Houston Astros crushed their way to a 5-2 victory over the Oakland A's in a neutral-site game at the home of the Los Angeles Dodgers.


  Martin Maldonado also hit a home run as the Astros went deep three times, one day after hitting another three homers in Game 1 of the AL Division Series. Houston will look to sweep the best-of-three series on Wednesday.


  "Obviously it's big for us, but that's an outstanding team over there," Springer said. "It's about inning by inning, pitch by pitch. We understand what the A's can do offensively, and on the mound, so we'll see what happens."


  Astros starter Framber Valdez (2-0) gave up two runs on five hits over seven innings. He walked one and struck out four.


  Khris Davis and Chad Pinder hit home runs for the A's, who now need to win three consecutive games in order to advance to the ALCS, which starts Sunday at San Diego.


  "His performance was great," Astros manager Dusty Baker said about Valdez. "He only made one mistake. He hung a curveball to Khris Davis, that was it. The rest of the curveballs were down low and he back-doored them, front-doored them, and then he'll throw a fastball by you."


  The Astros and A's have combined for 11 home runs in two games of the series. By comparison, the Dodgers and Milwaukee Brewers played two National League wild-card games in the same venue last week and combined for two homers.


  Springer's two-homer day followed a multi-homer performance from teammate Carlos Correa on Monday. Springer has six hits in the series, and coupled with his show-stopping performance in the 2017 World Series, he is 13-for-26 (.500) with five home runs and nine RBIs in six career playoff games at Dodger Stadium.


  Springer also extended his Astros postseason-homer record to 17.


  "Honestly, it's about enjoying the moment," Springer said about his playoff success. "It's understanding that you may never get back to being here ever again. There are guys that go their whole careers without ever stepping foot in the playoffs, so it's being fortunate to be here. It's an honor."


  Davis put the A's on top 1-0 in the second inning with his second home run of the series, but Springer topped that with a two-run shot into left-center in the third. Springer's blast came two batters after a Josh Reddick single.


  The A's have taken the early lead in each of the first two games of the series but have failed to sustain offensive momentum.


  "It changed the energy when we put them on their heels and then they put us on our heels," Pinder said. "We really knew going into this (that) this would be a dogfight. This is (an Astros) team with experience in the postseason. They have great talent and they're not going to just roll over. We have to find a way to pull ourselves out of this."


  In the fourth inning, the Astros took a 3-1 lead on a one-out ground ball from Correa that the A's were unable to turn into an inning-ending double play because Houston's Kyle Tucker was breaking from first base on the pitch.


  The A's pulled to within a run in the fourth inning when Pinder hit a blast into the empty stands in right-center.


  The Astros moved ahead 4-2 in the fifth on Maldonado's home run that knocked Oakland starter Sean Manaea from the game. On the first pitch from A's reliever Yusmeiro Petit, Springer hit one over the wall in left.


  Manaea (0-1) gave up four runs on five hits over 4 1/3 innings with one walk and two strikeouts.


  "Our backs are against the wall and we have to come out fighting (Wednesday)," Manaea said. "I think we're ready for that."


  Houston's bullpen followed five hitless innings in Game 1 with two scoreless innings in Game 2. Right-hander Ryan Pressley finished off Oakland in the ninth inning for his second save of the postseason.

“They brought in tests from just any company,” said Victor Chu, head of Diagnostica Peruana, one of the older pharmaceutical companies in the country. “Anyone can buy the brand they want, the quantity they want, with hardly any control.”
 ___
 The FDA – which countries like Peru routinely turn to for guidance – was initially lax on what antibody tests were allowed on the market.
 The agency had been criticized for acting too slowly in making molecular tests available. When antibody exams entered the picture, it opted to move fast. U.S. regulators allowed the blood tests to hit the market without first providing proof that they worked. They were only required to notify the FDA of their plans and provide disclaimers.
 By May, the FDA announced it was rescinding that policy as part of a crackdown on the quality of products introduced on an emergency basis.
 “We, unfortunately, see unscrupulous actors marketing fraudulent kits and using the pandemic as an opportunity to take advantage of Americans,” FDA Deputy Commissioner Anan Shah said.
 But Americans weren’t the only ones who were sold on faulty products.

La respuesta ha llegado por boca del senador 'popular' Fernando de Rosa Torner, que ha avanzado que su grupo parlamentario votará en contra porque no se "fía" de Unidas Podemos, al que ha definido como un potencial "caballo de Troya de los dinamitadores del Poder Judicial para que comience la purga de jueces y magistrados como ha pasado en la Fiscalía", recalcando que la parte socialista del Gobierno tampoco se fiaría de sus socios 'podemitas' porque no les comunicó la fusión entre Bankia y Caixabank.
 Además, ha aprovechado para hacerse eco del auto que se ha conocido este mismo miércoles del juez de la Audiencia Nacional Manuel García Castellón por el cual pide al Tribunal Supremo que investigue al vicepresidente segundo del Gobierno y líder de Podemos, Pablo Iglesias, por los delitos de descubrimiento y revelación de secretos, con agravante de género, daños informáticos y acusación o denuncia falsa y/o simulación del delito en relación al caso 'Dina'.
 "Vemos que este Gobierno no tiene ninguna vergüenza manteniendo al vicepresidente, pero ahora entendemos las prisas que tienen ustedes para renovar (el CGPJ), para tapar las vergüenzas del caso 'Dina', este es el Gobierno del caso 'Dina'", ha espetado De Rosa Torner.
 Asimismo, ha aclarado que el PP tampoco apoyará la reforma de la Ley Orgánica del Poder Judicial (LOPJ) que sopesa hacer el Gobierno para desbloquear la renovación del CGPJ y el TC, por considerar que con ello intenta "coaccionar" al Partido Popular, ante lo cual ha subrayado que la formación política no responde a "amenazas". A este respecto, también ha confirmado que, de materializarse, el PP impugnará esta "reforma sectaria" en el TC.
 Jacobo González-Robatto, de Vox, ha rechazado igualmente la moción, aduciendo que es un intento del Gobierno para "meter la mano en la Justicia" y "tapar sus casos de corrupción". En cuanto a la posible reforma de la LOPJ, la ha descrito como "un ataque subversivo a la Constitución" cuyo fin sería "amedrentar" al PP para que se avenga a negociar la renovación de TC y CGPJ. "Les instamos a oponerse rotundamente y a empezar a ejercer como partido de la oposición", ha exhortado a los 'populares.
 UNA REFORMA HACIA LA "DESPOLITIZACIÓN"
 El resto de grupos parlamentarios, en cambio, han expresado su apoyo a la moción, por cuanto aboga por la renovación de los órganos constitucionales, que todos los intervinientes han considerado una obligación constitucional, si bien al mismo tiempo han planteado la necesidad de emprender una reforma de la LOPJ que realmente suponga una "despolitización" del Poder Judicial, criticando al PSOE que siempre ha participado del sistema de "reparto por cuotas".
 Así se ha manifestado Carles Mulet, de Compromís y representante del grupo de la izquierda confederal, que ha abogado por una reforma más ambiciosa y ha reprochado al PP, "el primer partido político condenado por corrupción y que acumula cientos de casos", que "se dedique a obstaculizar la renovación del órgano que decide los puestos clave de la justicia española".
 Imanol Landa Jáuregui, del PNV, ha anticipado asimismo un voto favorable ante lo que considera "una situación absolutamente insostenible". En su caso, ha estimado que, aunque "no faltan razones para modificar" el sistema de renovación de los órganos constitucionales, apuntando que "el problema está más en el uso y el abuso del sistema que en el propio sistema", "es lo que es y resulta, por tanto, de obligado cumplimiento".
 Por su parte, Laura Castel, de ERC y que ha hablado en nombre de la formación catalana y de Bildu, ha afeado al PP, "que se considera el campeón del constitucionalismo", que se haya "bunkerizado" en el Poder Judicial para que perviva "una caducada versión del CGPJ que no refleja la voluntad de las urnas" con el fin de "garantizarse el control de los nombramientos de la cúpula judicial". "Estas prácticas son anticonstitucionales", ha denunciado.
 En una posición intermedia se ha situado Miguel Sánchez López, de Ciudadanos, que ha justificado la abstención de su grupo parlamentario porque, según ha dicho, están a favor de "desbloquear pero también de despolitizar". Además, al igual que PP y Vox, ha aludido a los problemas judiciales de los morados. "Ahora se entienden las prisas de Podemos por colocar a vocales afines en el CGPJ", ha deslizado.
 Por último, Josep Maria Cervera, de JxCat y el grupo nacionalista, ha manifestado que no votan 'no' porque "resulta evidente que la actitud de los 'populares' de querer controlar el Poder Judicial por la puerta de atrás no es de recibo", pero que tampoco votan 'sí' porque la iniciativa socialista obedecería solo al hecho de que su "plan B" --intentar pactar la composición del CGPJ y del TC con el PP-- ha fracasado.

Adds comment by Valerie Bertinelli)


  By Dan Whitcomb


  LOS ANGELES, Oct 6 (Reuters) - Eddie Van Halen, the pioneering guitar player whose hard-rocking band emerged from the Sunset Strip music scene in Los Angeles in the early 1970s to stand at the top of rock 'n' roll for a decade, died of cancer on Tuesday. He was 65.


  Van Halen's death was announced by his 29-year-old son, Wolfgang, a bass player who joined the band, best known for songs like "Jump" and "Ain't Talkin 'Bout Love," in later years.


  "I can't believe I'm having to write this but my father, Edward Lodewijk Van Halen, has lost his long and arduous battle with cancer this morning," Wolfgang Van Halen said on Twitter.


  "He was the best father I could ever ask for," the younger Van Halen said in the tweet. "Every moment I've shared with him on and off stage was a gift."


  Representatives for Eddie Van Halen did not disclose details of his death. People magazine reported the rocker died at a Los Angeles-area hospital with his wife, Janie, son and other family members at his side.


  "Through all your challenging treatments for lung cancer you kept your gorgeous spirit and that impish grin," his former wife of 26 years, actress Valerie Bertinelli, said on Twitter. "I'm so grateful that Wolfie and I were able to hold you in your last moments. I will see you in our next life my love."


  Fans placed flowers and guitar picks on Van Halen's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. "My heart is broken. Eddie was not only a Guitar God, but a genuinely beautiful soul," Gene Simmons, lead singer of Kiss and an early champion of Van Halen with record companies, said on Twitter.


  Eddie Van Halen was born in Amsterdam on Jan. 26, 1955, and studied classical piano after moving to the Los Angeles suburb of Pasadena with his family in the 1960s.


  After switching to guitar, he and his older brother Alex, who took up the drums, formed bands that would eventually become Van Halen in the mid-1970s, with lead singer David Lee Roth and bassist Michael Anthony.


  The hard rock band, featuring Eddie Van Halen's explosive riffs and solos, quickly became a staple of Sunset Strip clubs such as Gazzari's and the Whisky a Go Go before releasing their eponymous debut album in 1978.


  That album shot to No. 19 on the Billboard charts, becoming one of the most successful debuts of the decade and the first in a string of top-selling albums that would make Van Halen one of the biggest rock acts of the late 1970s and early 1980s.


  Eddie Van Halen, known for his two handed tapping technique on the strings, earned a place along Jimi Hendrix, Eric Clapton and Jimmy Page as one of rock's most celebrated guitarists. In 2012 readers of Guitar World magazine voted him the greatest of all time.


  Roth, a flamboyant frontman who often clashed with the Van Halen brothers, split from the band in the mid-1980s and was replaced for a decade by Sammy Hagar. The original lineup reunited in 2007 for a tour and, four years later, an album.

PARIS, Oct 6 (Reuters) - Argentina's Diego Schwartzman outlasted Dominic Thiem in a brutal claycourt war of attrition to win 7-6(1) 5-7 6-7(6) 7-6(5) 6-2 and reach his first French Open semi-final on Tuesday.
 Schwartzman had never beaten a top-five player at a Grand Slam and had lost his three previous quarter-finals but he produced a relentless display to set that record straight.
 Both players appeared to be running on empty at times as they slugged out endless rallies from the baseline for more than five hours on a windy Court Phillipe Chatrier.
 Third seed Thiem, the U.S Open champion, saved a set point in the third before moving two sets to one ahead and when Schwartzman wasted three set points at 5-4 in the fourth it looked as though he was going to fall short.
 But the 12th seed showed incredible resilience to come back from 3-1 down in the tiebreak to drag it into a final set.
 Schwartzman looked the fresher player in the decider and Thiem, bidding to reach a fifth successive French Open semi-final, began to unravel.
 The Argentine sensed his moment and forged a break ahead before claiming victory as Thiem dumped a weary-looking drop shot into the net on match point.
 Schwartzman will face either 12-time champion Rafa Nadal, who he beat in the recent Rome tournament, or Italian teenager Jannick Sinner in the last four.
 Second seed Nadal's clash with Sinner was still to be played after a women's quarter-final on Tuesday. (Reporting by Martyn Herman; Editing by Ken Ferris)

LOS ANGELES -- George Springer hit two home runs and the Houston Astros crushed their way within one victory of their fourth consecutive American League Championship Series, beating the Oakland A's 5-2 Tuesday at Dodger Stadium.


  Martin Maldonado also hit a home run as the Astros went deep three times, one day after hitting another three homers in Game 1 of the AL Division Series. Houston will look to sweep the best-of-three series on Wednesday.


  Astros starter Framber Valdez (2-0) gave up two runs on five hits over seven innings. He walked one and struck out four.


  Khris Davis and Chad Pinder hit home runs for the A's, who now need to win three consecutive games in order to advance to the ALCS starting Sunday at San Diego.


  The Astros and A's have combined for 11 home runs in two games of the series. By comparison, the Los Angeles Dodgers and Milwaukee Brewers played two National League wild-card games in the same venue last week and combined for two homers.


  Springer's two-homer day followed a multi-homer performance from teammate Carlos Correa on Monday. Springer has six hits in the series, and coupled with his show-stopping performance in the 2017 World Series, he is 13-for-26 (.500) with five home runs and nine RBIs in six career playoff games at Dodger Stadium.


  Davis put the A's on top 1-0 in the second inning with his second home run of the series, but Springer topped that with a two-run shot into left-center in the fourth. Springer's blast came two batters after a Josh Reddick single.


  In the fourth inning, the Astros took a 3-1 lead on a one-out ground ball from Correa that the A's were unable to turn an inning-ending double play on because Houston's Kyle Tucker was breaking from first base on the pitch.


  The A's pulled to within a run in the fourth inning when Pinder hit a blast into the empty stands in right-center.


  The Astros moved ahead 4-2 in the fifth on Maldonado's home run that knocked Oakland starter Sean Manaea from the game. On the first pitch from A's reliever Yusmeiro Petit, Springer hit one over the wall in left.


  Manaea (0-1) gave up four runs on five hits over 4 1/3 innings with one walk and two strikeouts.


  Houston's bullpen followed five hitless innings in Game 1 with two scoreless innings in Game 2. Right-hander Ryan Pressley finished off Oakland in the ninth inning for his second save of the postseason.

The government announced team sports are among the activities being barred in Quebec’s COVID-19 “red zones,” which include the greater Montreal area and Quebec City. The Armada are based just under 22 miles (35 kilometers) northwest of Montreal.
 “Although our sanitary and medical protocol is very strict and rigorous, we knew that COVID-19 was highly infectious and could eventually hit certain players and team staff members,” QMJHL commissioner Gilles Courteau said in a statement as reported by the Canadian Press. "Nevertheless, we are extremely confident that the measures contained in our contingency plan, which is currently deployed, will prove to be very efficient.”
 The QMJHL’s schedule this season features only intra-divisional play. The six teams based in the Atlantic provinces do not enter Quebec.

Change is on the way! This morning we see the fog and stratus thanks to high pressure still over the area. There will not be as much clearing as yesterday so expect partly sunny afternoon skies, highs near 67. The marine clouds roll back in tonight, the low near 53.
 Tomorrow the high pressure ridge weakens and starts to shift eastward with the approach of a low pressure trough from the northwest. The onshore winds increase, thickening the marine layer which gives us a slight chance of drizzle, especially in the morning hours tomorrow. Tomorrow night we see a slight chance of some scattered showers but by Friday an approaching cold front brings an increasing chance of rain starting in the afternoon with rain likely later Friday then the front pushes through late Friday night into Saturday morning.
 We expect post frontal showers Saturday behind the front and the models have hinted, off and on, that there was a slight chance of thunderstorms Saturday also. For now, the chance is minimal. High temperatures Saturday around 60, lows, with the rain returning, around 50. We have a chance of rain still on Sunday then a chance of showers Monday.

Quante volte capita che il cibo ci cada a terra? Magari siamo appena svegli, e quindi più distratti, e vediamo la nostra colazione precipitare al suolo. E la giornata ci sembra già prendere una piega negativa. E quindi ci affrettiamo a piegarci e raccogliere tutto. Infatti, la regola dei 5 secondi ci dice che se prendiamo il cibo caduto a terra entro questo tempo, possiamo ancora mangiarlo. Ma si tratta di una leggenda metropolitana o di verità? Insomma, chi ci assicura che se il cibo cade a terra vale davvero la regola dei 5 secondi? Vediamo il parere di alcuni esperti in merito.

Nemesis is more often personified, and hence capitalized, than até. She’s a goddess of retribution, and she can follow acts of hubris with the certainty of a law of gravity – except that there may be a considerable time lag, as if one dropped a plate and it took a generation for it to break. That concept likewise appears in the Bible’s book of Ezekiel, which says “The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the teeth of the children shall be set on edge.”

WASHINGTON, D.C. — President Donald Trump announced he has authorized the declassification of documents related to the FBI's Russia investigation and the probe into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email account, part of his efforts to cast aspersions on his political enemies as he falls further behind in his bid for reelection.
 "I have fully authorized the total Declassification of any & all documents pertaining to the single greatest political CRIME in American History, the Russia Hoax," Trump tweeted Tuesday.
 "Likewise, the Hillary Clinton Email Scandal. No redactions!" Trump said.
 Former FBI Director James Comey told a Senate committee last week that the inquiry into whether people close to Trump conspired with Russia to interfere in the 2016 election was largely conducted "by the book" but that specific aspects of the inquiry fell short.

 La vicepresidente tercera del Gobierno ha explicado que esta transformación se articulará tanto a través de proyectos específicos, así como explotando las sinergias con otros proyectos del plan, especialmente las relacionadas con la transición verde. Por ejemplo, ha apuntado que la digitalización permitirá una reducción del 10% las emisiones de CO2.
 DESGLOSE DE INVERSIONES
 En concreto, el plan contempla la inversión de 4.000 millones de euros en conectividad digital, ciberseguridad y despliegue del 5G, así como destinar 3.500 millones de euros a la formación en competencia digitales y 2.600 millones de euros a la digitalización de las administración públicas.
 Por su parte, las inversiones destinadas a los seis macroproyectos tractores identificados ascenderán a 2.200 millones de euros, mientras que en la digitalización y el crecimiento de pymes y startups se emplearán 1.150 millones de euros.
 Otras inversiones contempladas en el plan van destinadas al impulso de la economía del dato y la Inteligencia Artificial (IA), con 500 millones de euros, y al desarrollo del 'Spain Audiovisual Hub', con 200 millones de euros. Por su parte, las sinergias con otros ejes del plan supondrán una inversión de 5.450 millones de euros.
 Calviño ha indicado que el camino para avanzar en los "ambiciosos" objetivos que se ha marcado el Gobierno está trazado en la Agenda Digital España 2025, que el Ejecutivo presentó a finales del mes de julio y que supone "la hora de ruta" de todo el proceso de digitalización del país.
 En este sentido, ha recordado que este plan se articula sobre diez ejes estratégicos y tiene un objetivo transversal, que es que la digitalización contribuya "de forma importante" a cerrar las brechas sociales, territoriales y de género que se han agrandado en los últimos años.

Waseca County authorities charged a Waterville man for burglary and drug possession following a report of stolen copper wire and scrap metal at a Janesville business.


  Alex Tanner Vincent, 27, is charged with possession of burglary or theft tools and fifth-degree drug possession, both felony charges.


  On Sept. 11, Janesville Police Chief David Ulmen briefed a Janesville officer on a theft that occurred on Sept. 10 at a local business. A business owner in Janesville reported copper wire and scrap metal stolen from their property and had video surveillance of the suspected vehicle and person.


  According to the complaint, the video showed a maroon Chevrolet Suburban at the business at 5 p.m. on Sept. 10 with one person loading copper wire and scrap metal into the vehicle. Then at 8 p.m. the same Suburban returned with two people loading an air conditioning unit and a furnace into the vehicle.


  On Sept. 15 the same Janesville officer observed the suspected Suburban driving through the alley between the Janesville Police Station and main street businesses.


  The officer followed the vehicle to a gravel lot of another local business and stopped the vehicle after informing a second officer of doing so. Once the vehicle stopped, the officer approached it and informed the male driver that the vehicle was seen on video surveillance taking copper and scrap metal, according to the complaint.


  The driver of the Suburban, who police identified as Vincent, allegedly acknowledged that he had been in the city the week prior and collected items from the business in Janesville with permission to do so from the owner.


  While the first officer spoke with Vincent the second officer observed from the passenger side of the Suburban.


  The first officer took the driver’s license of the male to run it in the squad car while the second officer continued to observe. The second officer noticed tin snips, bolt cutters, a reciprocating saw, a grinder and other tools in the vehicle often used in burglaries, according to the police report. The first officer also noticed gloves and a flashlight in the center console.


  The first officer stayed in the squad car and called the business owner asking if they knew the suspect, Vincent, while the second officer spoke with Vincent in his Suburban. The business owner said they didn’t know Vincent, according to the police report.


  After the phone call, video surveillance and observation, the two officers decided to search Vincent’s vehicle based on probable cause.


  The first officer asked Vincent to step out of the vehicle and when asked to step out of the vehicle Vincent asked if he could pay for the scrap metal and things that he took instead, according to the complaint.


  The first officer searched the vehicle and Vincent allegedly informed them of a pill bottle in the center console. He stated that the bottle label is a different prescription than what the bottle actually contained.


  While the first officer conducted the search, a Waseca County Sheriff’s Deputy arrived to assist and suggested that the business owner be called to come and identify Vincent and the Suburban, based on the video surveillance footage.


  The business owner allegedly identified the suspect, Vincent, based on photos from their surveillance system showing Vincent and the vehicle in question. Before the traffic stop Vincent allegedly stopped at the business again, according to the business owner.


  At this time the property owner of the gravel lot arrived and stated Vincent stopped at his business before as well. Vincent allegedly asked if he could collect scrap from the salvage pile and was told no and to leave by the owner.


  Through the search, the officers collected a total of $7,070 in cash, a reciprocating saw, drills, bag of tools, flashlight, heat lamp, miscellaneous tools, gloves and a prescription bottle with different prescription pills.


  The business owner, who called the police, identified color-coated wiring in the back of the Suburban that belonged to them, according to the police report and the owner gave a rough estimate of the stolen items at a value of about $250-300.


  The sheriff’s deputy brought Vincent into the county jail on Sept. 15.

 # Judge delays release of names of businesses linked to COVID-19 for at least seven weeks
 Daphne Chen
 Milwaukee Journal Sentinel
 View Comments
 The names of businesses linked to COVID-19 cases, originally set to be released last week, will be delayed until at least late November while a lawsuit brought by the state’s largest business lobby moves forward.
 Waukesha County Circuit Judge Lloyd Carter granted a request from Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce to extend a restraining order blocking the state health department from releasing the data at a hearing on Wednesday.
 The Wisconsin Department of Health Services was set to release the records last Friday in response to a public records request from the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel filed in June for data on facilities with COVID-19 outbreaks.
 During the hearing, Carter stated the data includes the names of approximately 1,000 businesses with 25 or more employees who have had at least two employees test positive. The records do not include data from the past 28 days.
 Ryan Walsh, attorney for Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce, said those businesses could suffer “irreparable harm” if their names are released. The trade association also argued that the public might be able to identify specific employees who tested positive for COVID-19 from the data.
 “Our phones are ringing off the hook from members around the state worried about this,” Walsh said.
 Andie Bensky, an assistant attorney general appearing on behalf of the state health department and Gov. Tony Evers, argued that the health department has the authority to use its discretion in determining whether disclosing the records is in the public interest.
 According to Bensky, the health department has around 20 outstanding open records requests seeking similar data.
 There is “tremendous public interest” in the outbreak data, she said, adding that there is “no evidence whatsoever beyond generalized speculation that any of the member employers are going to suffer any injury at all.”
 “A lot of that information is already in the public sphere,” she said.
 Tom Kamenick, an attorney with the Wisconsin Transparency Project, appeared on behalf of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel at the hearing Wednesday.
 Many workers at food processing plants told the Journal Sentinel they first learned about cases at their companies through co-workers. The newspaper has also reported on nursing home residents and their loved ones who said administrators did not inform them about outbreaks until residents started dying.
 Public health and open records experts have argued in favor of transparency.
 Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association, previously said the information can help the public be more aware about whether they may have been exposed.
 “Transparency enhances our ability to do effective disease containment,” Benjamin said. “The less transparent we are, the more difficult it is.”

So once I separated from active duty, I never again took a flu shot -- and that's been 40 years now. So do I get the flu during flu season now that I don't take the shot? Oh, maybe once every six or seven years. That's a whole lot better than every year.

 LOS ANGELES, Oct 6 (Reuters) - Eddie Van Halen, considered one of rock music's greatest guitar players and a founding member of the hugely successful rock band named after him and his drummer brother, died of cancer on Tuesday, his son said on Twitter. He was 65.
 "I can't believe I'm having to write this but my father, Edward Lodewijk Van Halen, has lost his long and arduous battle with cancer this morning," Wolfgang Van Halen, a bass player who played with his father in the band, said in the tweet.
 "He was the best father I could ever ask for," Wolfgang Van Halen said on Twitter. "Every moment I've shared with him on and off stage was a gift."
 Eddie and his brother Alex founded Van Halen in the early 1970s in Los Angeles and the hard rock band became a staple of the famed Sunset Strip before releasing their eponymous debut album in 1978.
 The album shot to number 19 on the Billboard charts, becoming one of the most successful debuts of the decade. (Reporting by Dan Whitcomb; Editing by Leslie Adler and Aurora Ellis)

  WASHINGTON, Oct 7 (Reuters) - A scathing report detailing abuses of market power by four top technology companies suggests a tough road ahead of new rules and stricter enforcement for Big Tech should Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden win the White House.


  Antitrust experts and congressional aides said the 449-page report from the antitrust panel of the House Judiciary Committee, released on Tuesday, lays out a road map for the Democratic Party to put the brakes on the dominance of Alphabet Inc's Google, Apple Inc, Amazon.com Inc and Facebook Inc.


  With the Nov. 3 election approaching fast and a new Congress scheduled to be sworn in in January, action on the report's recommendations this year is unlikely and no new legislative changes are imminent. However, the findings boost the chances for new laws in the future and will inform existing investigations against large technology companies by state attorneys general and agencies such as the Federal Trade Commission.


  The report reflects the views of Democrats on the antitrust subcommittee in the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives. Republicans on the panel released two separate reports on the investigation.


  "This basically lays out the Democratic Party's position on tech platforms and how antitrust laws need to be refined and strengthened," said Sarah Miller, executive director of the American Economic Liberties Project, a Washington-based group focused on monopoly power.


  "The report has done a lot of work to set up where and why a Biden administration should act and how it should prioritize the recommendations in the report," she said. Miller is one of hundreds of members of the Biden campaign's tech policy committee.


  William Kovacic, a former chair of the Federal Trade Commission, warned that the companies will "pull out all the stops" in lobbying against the changes.


  Earlier this month, Reuters reported how large tech companies including Amazon were cozying up to the Biden campaign with cash and connections.


  Biden has previously said antitrust enforcement has not been strong and that tech firms deserve a hard look from the federal agencies that oversee competition. He has stayed away from calling for the breakup of large technology companies, saying it would be premature to do so without a formal investigation.


  The House report on Tuesday broadly recommended that companies should not both control and compete in related businesses, but stopped short of naming a specific company. Anti-monopoly experts and congressional aides said the report, which details Big Tech's abuses, has the potential to influence the thinking of Biden on the issue.


  A spokesman for the Biden campaign did not immediately comment.


  The antitrust panel will take up the majority report after the October recess for formal adoption and will have a vote on it, counsels for the committee said. The next step will be coming up with legislation to put the report's recommendations into action.


  When asked about whether U.S. Representative David Cicilline, the chairman of the House Judiciary antitrust subcommittee, was considering legislation, a spokesman said the Rhode Island Democrat has said he wants all stakeholders to weigh in and that it was safe to say all options are being considered.

Effy continued speaking about Still Life's backstory and their history at CHIKARA. He noted how similar they are coming from promotions that featured eccentric characters, and he also noted that this first-time match-up should have happened at Hoodslam but didn't mind that the match will happen at his show.
 "And now I have someone like Still Life, who I've been able to follow their career for a while," Effy stated. "And seeing Chikara fall apart and seeing how much work all those kids were putting into Chikara and seeing that pulled out from them, I mean, this is where they were training, where they were doing shows, where they were trying things out, where they were learning so much about their characters.
 "To be able to kind of pull them aside and say, 'hey, you're good. Do your thing. Keep going, keep doing this and keep being weird' and to see that continue to pay off and have these new opportunities, it's a real east coast- west coast -- I don't want to say they're both kind of visionary in a way, but they definitely have a very different way of looking at wrestling than most people and what a lot of people don't know is Still Life is very very inspired by _Dark_ Sheik. They became good friends, and so this a first time match-up that probably should have happened at Hoodslam, but I got to steal the scoop on it."
 Hausman and Effy moved on to talk about CHIKARA and it's closure after #SpeakingOut allegations came to light regarding CHIKARA and owner Mike Quackenbush's alleged history of systemic abuses towards female staffers and trainers. Effy encouraged former CHIKARA talent to continue to use their gimmicks even if they do not own the copyright, noting he may even end up in court against Quackenbush.
 "I was upset more, and I don't want to dwell on this too long," Effy said. "I was upset more because finding out how creative was handled and finding out what Mike was kind of holding back from them being able to do and understanding that it was his flaws that were keeping them from going to the next level because if I was in charge of CHIKARA, day one, what am I doing?
 "I'm calling up every elementary and middle school and saying, 'can we host a positive wrestling thing in your gym to teach kids about bullying, to teach kids about being kind [and] to teach kids about standing up for themselves. I would work into that because you have a children's program, and now looking back on it, you go, maybe he was just trying to not get his handle any closer to families and children.
 "And maybe that's what the deal was. But I look at the CHIKARA kids and technically, Quackenbush owns all their rights. I told every single one of them, and I'll probably end up going to court for it, I go, 'f--k him'. Use every bit of what you have, use all of it and make him fight you on it because he has no place here."
 Effy, an openly gay wrestler, is not afraid to speak about LGBTQ issues in the wrestling industry especially regarding how LGBTQ talent are treated. He referred to a promo he cut at RISE Wrestling calling out all wrestling promotions for only booking LGBTQ wrestlers during Pride Month or as Effy said in his promo, "it only happens when the gays are allowed to be celebrated." Effy discussed on the podcast what creating a safe space for LGBTQ talent can do for the industry.
 "Beyond even the performers, it's really good to have that spot for the performers and it's been over a year now at that last RISE show in June last year. They had that Pride RISE show," Effy recalled. "I cut a promo that basically said, 'hey, you're booking these people for Pride Month, and I get it, but if you don't stop, we're going to take over and ruin your business financially. And I think a lot of people thought, 'oh, you must be doing a run-in. It must be a work,' but what I knew was, we're not going to participate in this anymore.
 "We're going to make sure people know that you're bad people. We're going to make sure people know your views, and we're going to take that money away from you if you can't at least act like decent human beings or at least give the opportunity to people. Some people misconstrue it and say, 'oh, well, he only wants LGBT people on cards,' and it's like, no, but I would like them looked at in the same regard that a cis-white male athlete is looked at to at least set the playing field even and give those chances.
 "And when we can't get those chances, we're now looking back at these other places and going, look what you missed out on. Look at how many people got behind this. When you create a safe space, financially, you can benefit. You're not losing fans by being more progressive or more liberal or whatever it may be. You're actually opening the door for these people that would have never stepped foot in wrestling."
 Hausman asked if LGBTQ talent have seen any momentum lately similar to how Women's Revolution and Black Lives Matter have created some change in the wrestling industry. Effy said that it would have to take a LGBTQ wrestler to succeed outside of the cable television space to show bigger companies that their platform is not the end all and be all for talent.
 "You know, I thought about it, and what it really needs to take is not necessarily just saying, 'OK, we have a gay person on our show,' but I think we need to go around what the expectations of companies are because I think if the company sees someone who is an LGBT wrestler, and I'm not talking about myself, I don't care if it's me, whoever it is, to kind of crossover without the necessity of a cable television show or without the necessity of a larger wrestling company behind it," Effy explained. "I think that would at least show these bigger companies that, 'oh, the thing we were afraid to do, which has pissed people off, is actually financially responsible,' and it might take that sort of punch in the face to see something they missed out on because they thought they couldn't handle something different or new.
 "Seeing that make money when they could have had that opportunity, I think will wake people up because it's the only thing that speaks anymore me. Why do you think WWE's in Saudi Arabia? It's not because they love the culture in the region. They're getting a f--k ton of money.
 "If we financially force them into a position to use us, we're going to have the leverage. I don't just want to be given permission. I want to leverage back on you and go, 'look you messed up'. It's not vengeful, but now the pricing has changed and you could have gotten in on the ground floor."
 Joey Janela has spoken with Wrestling Inc. in the past where he discussed how GCW is different from any other wrestling company. Effy discussed on the podcast what it means to him that GCW is supporting him and the causes that he promotes.
 "I think with GCW, the reason they stayed so ahead of the curve is at no moment is GCW afraid to change directions or move towards something different if it's picking up steam or if it's hot or if they think it can be something that people would be entertained by," Effy said. "There's a lot of death matches in GCW, but there's also a lot of comedy and there's a lot of work rate and there's a lot of high flyers.
 "When things are cool and over with people, it's easy to categorize them, but GCW doesn't necessarily do that, and they're sort of trying to say, 'hey, here's all these different weird things we all like about wrestling. Here's stuff we saw that we thought was cool, and we're going to now put it together.' It's very collaborative.
 "It's not one person going, 'we're going to have the gay show. You're the face of the gay show, and here's who you're going to use.' Its Bret going, 'how do we bring a show like this to the community? Who do we need to include? Who do I not know about?' And letting him learn and he's going, 'it's a financial risk for me as a promoter to put people I've never heard of on here, but I'm trusting you as talent because of what I've seen from you and because of what you brought for me to show me a world that I'm missing out on.' And having that trust in your talent, it's an incredible thing that you don't get everywhere you're working in wrestling."

BROCKTON -- As the number of new coronavirus cases spikes in the city, the future of in-person learning is in limbo.
 Brockton Public Schools opened the year fully remote on Sept. 16, but administrators and the school committee have been hoping to bring some students back as soon as it is deemed safe to do so.
 The school committee decided it would look for three straight weeks of good transmission numbers -- including possible weeks at moderate risk on the state's risk assessment map, as long as the city wasn't close to high risk -- to possibly bring back some students for in-person learning.

 The city has been in the yellow, or moderate risk, category on the state's weekly risk assessment map the past two weeks since that policy was created and was hoping for another week of positive data come Wednesday evening to proceed toward a hybrid model of learning.
 But Brockton has been experiencing a "massive spike" in COVID-19 cases, Mayor Robert Sullivan said Monday evening. As of Tuesday afternoon, the Brockton Board of Health has reported more than eight new COVID-19 among city residents eight of the last nine days.
 "I'm a little concerned that we need to have a heightened level of awareness in the coming days, maybe weeks, because the numbers of cases per day have definitely increased lately," Dr. Richard Herman, the city's pandemic consultant, told school committee members Tuesday evening.
 When the Massachusetts Department of Public Health releases its weekly community-by-community report around 6 p.m. Wednesday, Herman predicts Brockton will be back in the highest risk category, a red classification, with more than eight cases per day per 100,000 residents over a two-week period.
 As of Tuesday evening, when Herman presented the most recent data he had to the Brockton School Committee, he anticipated Brockton would be at about 8.7 cases per day per 100,000 residents over the last two weeks.
 But that number appears to be going up, he said.
 The weekly Department of Public Health report only includes cases up to the previous Saturday. Since then, Brockton has reported 10 new COVID-19 cases on Sunday, another 10 on Monday and 13 on Tuesday.
 Over the first 10 days of the 14-day period that will be used to calculate Brockton's daily incidence rate come next Wednesday, Oct. 14, Herman said Brockton is currently at about 10.3 cases per day per 100,000 residents.
 "I don't know what the numbers are going to be over the next four days, but if it's a trend and they are going up like they are going, there's no reason to think that they're not going to change," he said.
 Herman said 10 Brockton children between the ages of 1 and 16 tested positive for COVID-19 over the last two weeks, which was about 8 percent of all cases reported in the city from Sept. 20 to Oct. 3.
 "To safely open the schools, you need to have low amount of COVID in the community," Herman said. "We know that especially in the higher grades, middle school and high school, COVID is likely to spread a little faster than it is in the 10-year-old and younger age group."
 Superintendent of Schools Michael Thomas didn't make any recommendation regarding a return to school buildings to the committee on Tuesday evening.
 "I just think obviously we need to see the numbers (Wednesday)," Thomas said. "Then I think we should have a policy meeting next week ... so we can discuss this further."
 Thomas has said he would like to bring back special education students, students with disabilities and high-risk students as soon as possible.
 Jess Hodges, a spokesperson for Brockton Public Schools, said the district will discuss next steps next week.
 "The Brockton School Committee, in following recommendations put forth by the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, voted on September 15 to begin phasing students back into the classroom after three consecutive weeks in the 'yellow,'" Hodges wrote in an email. "The School Committee scheduled a Policy Subcommittee meeting for Tuesday, October 13, during which they will review the current metrics and make a determination."

Automation and digitalisation present a potential for higher productivity growth. Yet, reaping this potential depends to a large extent on the availability of complementary assets such as human or managerial capital. Key aspects will include avoiding the digital divide within members states and to make further progress notably in terms of education and training with a view to improving job quality. This requires both public investment and private initiatives so that the labour market can fully reap the benefits of new technologies.

LOS ANGELES -- George Springer hit two home runs and the Houston Astros crushed their way within one victory of their fourth consecutive American League Championship Series, beating the Oakland A's 5-2 Tuesday at Dodger Stadium.
 Martin Maldonado also hit a home run as the Astros went deep three times, one day after hitting another three homers in Game 1 of the AL Division Series. Houston will look to sweep the best-of-three series on Wednesday.
 Astros starter Framber Valdez (2-0) gave up two runs on five hits over seven innings. He walked one and struck out four.
 Khris Davis and Chad Pinder hit home runs for the A's, who now need to win three consecutive games in order to advance to the ALCS starting Sunday at San Diego.
 The Astros and A's have combined for 11 home runs in two games of the series. By comparison, the Los Angeles Dodgers and Milwaukee Brewers played two National League wild-card games in the same venue last week and combined for two homers.
 Springer's two-homer day followed a multi-homer performance from teammate Carlos Correa on Monday. Springer has six hits in the series, and coupled with his show-stopping performance in the 2017 World Series, he is 13-for-26 (.500) with five home runs and nine RBIs in six career playoff games at Dodger Stadium.
 Davis put the A's on top 1-0 in the second inning with his second home run of the series, but Springer topped that with a two-run shot into left-center in the third. Springer's blast came two batters after a Josh Reddick single.
 In the fourth inning, the Astros took a 3-1 lead on a one-out ground ball from Correa that the A's were unable to turn into an inning-ending double play because Houston's Kyle Tucker was breaking from first base on the pitch.
 The A's pulled to within a run in the fourth inning when Pinder hit a blast into the empty stands in right-center.
 The Astros moved ahead 4-2 in the fifth on Maldonado's home run that knocked Oakland starter Sean Manaea from the game. On the first pitch from A's reliever Yusmeiro Petit, Springer hit one over the wall in left.
 Manaea (0-1) gave up four runs on five hits over 4 1/3 innings with one walk and two strikeouts.
 Houston's bullpen followed five hitless innings in Game 1 with two scoreless innings in Game 2. Right-hander Ryan Pressley finished off Oakland in the ninth inning for his second save of the postseason.

  LOS ANGELES (Variety.com) - While the season 18 premiere of "Ellen," which saw the host publicly address reports of mistreatment and misconduct behind the scenes for the first time, was even on last year, the rest of her premiere week took a tumble.


  For the week of Sept. 21, "Ellen" averaged a 1.2 Live+Same Day household ratings according to Nielsen, which represents a 29% drop from last season's premiere week. In terms of total viewership, DeGeneres drew 1.7 million average viewers per episode, down roughly 37% from the equivalent week in 2019.


  Syndicated talk shows were down almost across the board for premiere week, even if "Ellen"'s decline was steeper than most. In fact, "Tamron Hall" and "Live With Kelly and Ryan" were the only two talk shows up fractionally on last year in total viewers (the former was up 2% and the latter 4%).


  So far this season, syndicated talk shows are down 19% on average year-over- year in terms of household rating, and down 21% in the key adults aged 25-54 demographic. Looking at total viewership, "Wendy Williams" saw the second largest premiere week decline at 24%, followed by "The Kelly Clarkson Show" at 19%, "Dr. Phil" at 18%, and "Dr. Oz" at 17%.


  In DeGeneres' seven-minute opener, she apologized and said she is "taking responsibility for what happens at my show," announcing a supposed "new chapter" of "Ellen."


  "As you may have heard, this summer there were allegations of a toxic work environment at our show and then there was an investigation. I learned that things happened here that never should have happened. I take that every seriously and I want to say I am so sorry to the people that were affected. I know that I am in a position of privilege and power and with that comes responsibility and I take responsibility for what happens at my show," DeGeneres said.

MOSCOW, Oct 6 (Reuters) - Russian rights groups on Tuesday called on the authorities to stop using home searches as a tactic to intimidate opponents after a journalist set herself on fire following a police raid of her apartment last week.
 Irina Slavina, editor-in-chief at a small news outlet in the city of Nizhny Novgorod, self-immolated in front of the local branch of the interior ministry in Nizhny Novgorod last Friday after blaming Russian authorities for her death in a Facebook post.
 A day before her death, investigators and police had searched her apartment for materials linked to the Open Russia opposition group, which is financed by Kremlin critic Mikhail Khodorkovsky.
 In a joint statement on Tuesday, the heads of Open Russia, the Memorial human rights group and the Public Verdict Foundation called on the authorities to refrain from carrying out unwarranted searches and to respect procedures - including the use of a warrant - when carrying out raids.
 "From a tool used to investigate a crime, searches have turned into a method of forceful and psychological pressure," the statement said.
 "As representatives of civic organisations, we demand that searches stop being used to intimidate citizens."
 The statement coincided with Slavina's funeral in Nizhny Novgorod, a city of 1.3 million about 400 km (250 miles) east of Moscow, where her supporters marched in a procession in her honour, with many clutching flowers.
 "Her death is a terrible tragedy, and we must ensure that no such tragedies happen again," said Andrei Pivovarov, executive director of Open Russia. "To do this, we need to stop all political repression and, first of all, do away with cynical and humiliating searches."
 The regional branch of the Investigative Committee, Russia's equivalent to the FBI, said last Friday that Slavina's self-immolation had nothing to do with the raid carried out at her apartment on the previous day.
 It said she had only been a witness in a criminal case and that the search was related to that. (Reporting by Gabrielle Tétrault-Farber; Editing by William Maclean)

BERLIN, Oct 7 (Reuters) - A Russian man charged with murdering a former Chechen rebel in Berlin on behalf of Moscow last year went on trial on Wednesday, heaping further pressure on diplomatic ties already strained by the poisoning of Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny.
 The shooting in August 2019 of Tornike K., a Georgian who had fought against Russia in Chechnya, led to the expulsion of Russian embassy employees in December.
 Prosecutors say 55-year-old Vadim K. approached the victim from behind on a bicycle in the Tiergarten park in central Berlin in broad daylight and shot him with a pistol equipped with a silencer.
 The suspect then shot the victim twice in the head while he lay on the ground, they say.
 Vadim K., also known as Vadim S., was arrested nearby soon after the attack and has been in custody ever since. He is charged with murder and the illegal possession of a weapon. If found guilty, he faces life in prison.
 "The defendant is alleged to have carried out a state mission, either for payment or because he shared the motives of his clients," the Berlin court said in a statement.
 Russia has denied any involvement in the killing.
 The trial begins as Chancellor Angela Merkel's government discusses with partners what action to take after the global chemicals watchdog confirmed Navalny was poisoned with a nerve agent from the banned Novichok family.
 Navalny was air-lifted to Berlin for treatment after collapsing on a flight in Siberia on Aug. 20. Germany and other Western governments have called on Russia to help with the investigation. Moscow denies it was involved in the poisoning. (Reporting by Madeline Chambers; editing by Barbara Lewis)

LONGUEUIL, Quebec (AP) - Eighteen members of a team in the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League have tested positive for the novel coronavirus.


  The Blainville-Boisbriand Armada announced the breakout Wednesday, two days after they suspended in-person activities. That move came after learning of one positive test following the first weekend of regular-season play in the QMJHL.


  Players and staff have been placed in isolation for 14 days. Team activities are suspended indefinitely.


  The Sherbrooke Phoenix also suspended in-person activities after playing the Armada twice last weekend.


  The QMJHL was the only one of three Canadian major-junior hockey leagues to open play around its traditional start date during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Ontario Hockey League and Western Hockey League have said they hope to start in December.


  The Armada´s problems started Monday with the positive test along with an announcement by the Quebec government affecting Blainville-Boisbriand and the Quebec Remparts.


  The government announced team sports are among the activities being barred in Quebec´s COVID-19 "red zones," which include the greater Montreal area and Quebec City. The Armada are based just under 22 miles (35 kilometers) northwest of Montreal.


  "Although our sanitary and medical protocol is very strict and rigorous, we knew that COVID-19 was highly infectious and could eventually hit certain players and team staff members," QMJHL commissioner Gilles Courteau said in a statement as reported by the Canadian Press. "Nevertheless, we are extremely confident that the measures contained in our contingency plan, which is currently deployed, will prove to be very efficient."


  The QMJHL´s schedule this season features only intra-divisional play. The six teams based in the Atlantic provinces do not enter Quebec.


  "As hockey players, you want to play games, and I didn´t play a lot last year, so I wanted to play as much as I could this year," said Chicoutimi Sagueneens center Hendrix Lapierre, who played two games with his team this past weekend before he was selected 22nd overall by the Washington Capitals in the NHL draft on Tuesday night. "I feel like it´s kind of an advantage for us to be able to play. ... I´m with my teammates. We´re playing games. Yes, we´re training, but we have games, we´re together, we´re bonding."

WORCESTER -- Dr. Anthony Fauci, the country's top infectious disease expert and a central figure in its fight against the coronavirus, paid a virtual visit to his alma mater Tuesday via an online question and answer session hosted by the College of the Holy Cross, where he told students to stay hopeful in the face of the "nightmare" pandemic.


  Fauci, who graduated from the college in 1962, took questions from students for about 40 minutes, delving into everything from current events to his personal history. The private event, which the school posted on YouTube Tuesday afternoon, was sponsored by Holy Cross's Rev. Michael C. McFarland, S.J. Center for Religion, Ethics and Culture.


  As head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Fauci has been a top adviser to presidential administrations for decades, and this year became one of the lead members of the White House Coronavirus Task Force.


  But as he acknowledged during Tuesday's event, his relationship with President Donald Trump has not always been harmonious.


  "That's something that I would say is a day-by-day challenge," he said. "But it's working."


  In response to a question from student Matthew Cedeno, who asked what level of confidence athletes like him should have in testing programs in light of the recent COVID-19 outbreak at the White House, Fauci said the situations were "apples and oranges."


  "I don't think you can extrapolate that (the White House outbreak) to other situations where people are really very careful," he said, going on to mostly praise collegiate and professional athletic leagues for their testing-based approach to restarting play this summer. "What went on in the White House … it was not done according to what I would have recommended."


  On the same day Trump, who tested positive for the virus last week, downplayed COVID-19 compared to the flu, Fauci reiterated his stance that the coronavirus represents the most challenging infectious disease threat in more than a century. When people used to ask him what kept him up at night, he said, a virus like COVID-19, which has so far killed more than 200,000 Americans, was his answer.


  "Unfortunately, I'm living now the so-called nightmare, the worst-case scenario," he said. "Because that's exactly what we have."


  But Fauci, who turns 80 on Christmas Eve, also imparted some more optimistic messages to students, including his belief that the world is still on track to see a vaccine for the coronavirus, "likely by the end of the year." He also pointed out that colleges like Holy Cross, which has yet to fully reopen its campus this fall, can take measures to suppress the spread of the virus in the meantime.


  "One of the things we have to be careful about is despair," he said. "Don't give up hope -- (this pandemic) is going to end."


  When it does, he said the country should also look back at who it failed this year, particularly the people of color who have been hit hardest by the coronavirus.


  "Social determinants are absolutely critical" to health outcomes, he said, noting that it's often people of color who, through circumstances out of their control, have poorer diets, worse access to medical care, and more limited economic opportunities that make them particularly susceptible to a disease like COVID-19.


  "We need to do something as a society to get rid of that enormous disparity," he said.


  Toward the end of Tuesday's event, Fauci also talked about his own background, including the sense of social responsibility his family taught him that led him to his current career.


  "I always felt I was more interested in human nature than human physiology," he said, adding that his experience at Holy Cross, where his pre-med track consisted of more philosophy courses than science courses, solidified that sense.


  His advice for today's students going into the scientific fields, meanwhile, is to always abide by science, to make decisions based on evidence, to be consistent, and to be transparent -- a philosophy he said has helped him while working with the Trump administration.


  It's also important to keep in mind, he said, that "you don't know everything at any given time -- there's more to learn."

The end of Bill O'Brien's tenure as head coach/general manager of the Houston Texans was curious in many different ways, and a recent report indicated that it might have been tumultuous behind closed doors. According to Aaron Wilson of the _Houston Chronicle_, O'Brien got into an argument with star defensive end J.J. Watt and defensive coordinator Anthony Weaver on the practice field along with verbal altercations with other staff members during his final weeks before being fired.
 This falls in line with what CBS Sports NFL Insider Jason La Canfora reported on Monday, as he said that O'Brien had been clashing with prominent players at practice, and taking over play-calling duties was his last attempt to salvage things within the organization. Another move that reportedly rubbed players the wrong way was O'Brien's push to bring in free agent safety Earl Thomas \-- a potential addition that was met with strong pushback by the Texans locker room.
 According to La Canfora, O'Brien's relationships with his players were long suffering, and the DeAndre Hopkins trade certainly did not help things. The Texans traded Hopkins and a 2020 fourth-round pick to the Arizona Cardinals this offseason for David Johnson and his huge contract, a 2020 second-round pick and a 2021 fourth-round pick. Many considered it very surprising that the Texans failed to acquire a first-round pick for one of the best receivers in the game.

Even if Kelly is elected, it's not a given that Democrats will have the votes to block Barrett's nomination but his vote could, in some scenarios, tip the scales.

 # Guarachi advances to French Open semifinals
 Seth Stringer
 Northwest Florida Daily News
 Wins aren’t supposed to be this easy at Roland-Garros.
 Certainly not in the quarterfinals. Certainly not for anyone not named Rafael Nadal.
 Yet here Miramar Beach native Alexa Guarachi and Desirae Krawczyk are, rolling into the French Open semifinals with Wednesday’s 6-0, 6-4 win over seventh- seeded Shuko Aoyama and Ena Shibahara.
 Just how dominant was it?
 Guarachi and Krawczyk, seeded 14th, won the opening eight games, converted on 5-of-9 break-point opportunities and were broken just once.
 But the clinic has been par for the course of their run at Roland-Garros, the duo dropping just a set in four wins. That includes a 6-4, 7-5 straight-sets victory over top-seeded Su-wei Hsieh and Barbora Strycova.
 Now Guarachi and Krawczyk advance to take on unseeded Iga Swiatek and Nicole Melichar on Friday at a time to be determined. It’ll be the first-ever semifinals appearance in a grand slam for Guarachi, who has two career WTA wins, and Krawczyk, who has four career WTA titles.
 Swiatek and Melichar have also dominated their foes, dropping just 21 games all tournament and not losing a set en route to knocking off the 12th- and sixth-seeded teams. Swiatek, just 19, is more of a singles specialist with a 54th world ranking and has no career WTA doubles crowns. Melichar is ranked 13th in the world in doubles with two WTA doubles titles this year and eight career crowns.

  # Give credit to pandemic truth-tellers


  The (Independence) Examiner


  Among the heroes of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic are the public health leaders who have tried to cut through sustained political interference and the fog of disinformation to give the public a clear picture of what the country is going through.


  It’s not a pretty picture, but it’s not the job of health officials to concern themselves with optics or with the next election.


  The nation has chosen a halting and half-hearted response, and we are paying a price. Washington has no coherent strategy beyond advice and — appropriately — throwing a lot of money at a handful of companies trying to develop, test and produce a vaccine. The state of Missouri also has chosen a non-policy other than its crossing fingers and saying people ought to do the right thing.


  Meanwhile, this remains a “red zone” state, and even the White House says Missouri needs a mask mandate. Eastern Jackson County has been in the “red zone” — a positivity rate of 10 percent or higher, meaning significant community spread of COVID-19 — for almost three months.


  The head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said repeatedly that the country could get this under control — drive it into the ground was his phrase — if people would simply embrace the use of masks and other simple, safe steps such as social distancing. It seems, now we’re in the fall and headed into the cold-and-flu season, that message might at last be getting through.


  One or more vaccines will come eventually, but it’s foolish to fall into silver-bullet thinking. It’s prudent and effective right now today to use the tools and protocols at hand: wash your hands, wear a mask, get a flu shot, stay socially distant, avoid large gatherings of any type.


  TV is full of ads and other messages implying that “back to normal” is here or at hand. Those ads are trying to sell you something — a new truck, a vacation, a candidate. But wishful thinking does not change the facts at hand.


  We’re a little more than half a year into this disease’s rapid spread across the United States, and chances are that we’re still nearer the beginning of this than the end. Milestones such as 200,000 deaths in the United States and 1 million worldwide were dismissed as hysterical in the spring but now come as just another headline.


  Those who try to explain this away say grievously unhelpful things such as, “It’s just the hospitalizations that matter” or “It’s just the deaths that matter.” Then one of those measures goes up, and the rhetoric shifts to another metric. All of which marginalizes the families left behind, those who are gravely sick for long periods and sometimes left with permanent health problems, and the steady damage to local businesses caught in this lingering struggle.


  The sooner we choose to get serious about the pandemic the sooner the economy — paychecks and profits — can get stable.

At the top of her game as she heads to the L-L individual tourney as the top seed, Palandjian defeated Kendal Winters in quick fashion.
 The combination of Henneman and Julia Briner looked just as good on the doubles court.
 John Briner said it’s rewarding as a coach of an individual sport to see his athletes embrace the team format.
 “Tennis can be a lonely sport when you are playing singles out there. Having an individual sport played in the team concept is a great thing,” he said. “They are all great friends. They are all going out for ice cream now. Having it as a team sport is phenomenal, and they really enjoy it.”
 Township’s Scotty Reynolds was only a game away from ending her match. The senior won the first set 6-0 and was ahead of Ryan Gerhardt 5-2 when play was halted.
 Just like the last time they met, Lampeter-Strasburg’s No. 2 doubles combo of Kati Platt and Cate Caldwell challenged Streaks Sophia Yost and Jade Miller.
 Platt and Caldwell won the first set, 6-3 when play retired for the day.

Remote and online courses are separated into two categories, according to the Office of the Registrar. Online, or synchronous, classes require students to virtually attend class at a specific day and time, while remote, or asynchronous, classes do not.
 Remote courses provide flexibility for non-traditional students who work, Bekdache said.
 “Generally for fully online, I do asynchronous, and I know students like it better this way because they can pace themselves throughout the week,” she said. “And a lot of people are sharing technology at home, so it’s very hard for them to be there for three hours.”
 Coloma also chose asynchronous because it works better for his graduate-level students who are often working teachers, he said.
 Bekdache finds she has more time for office hours or pop-up meetings now that she is in front of her computer so much, she said. There is no major difference in the number of students who attend her virtual office hours versus previous in person office hours.
 To stay in touch, Bekdache’s students form groups on WhatsApp, she said. Engaging students through discussion boards, in addition to WhatsApp groups, have been helpful as well, Coloma said.
 “For some students who might not be comfortable speaking in class get an opportunity to participate in meaningful ways through written work,” he said. “For those who are much more engaged in classrooms verbally, you give them an opportunity to pause and think.”
 Bekdache said she hopes the shift to virtual learning will help students become more comfortable with remote and online classes in the future.
 “I think that this will familiarize people with it, make them less intimidated, see that it can be the same—or as close as possible— and give them more choices in the future for completing their degree,” she said.

In 1973, he met Evonne Gianopulos, a first-grade teacher, in Chicago. They married the following year and moved to Forest Hills.


  The family remained close, said Jeffrey Spitzer.


  "We spent every holiday together; every Christmas, every Thanksgiving," he said. "My parents decided to not be selfish and to make sure that just because they got divorced, we shouldn't be affected."


  Roni and Evonne would call each other "wives-in-law," said Marty Spitzer. Evonne had a son named Peter Allas. No one used the term stepmother or stepbrother. There was just family.


  After working for Speidel until around 1973, Joel joined the Charles Rothman company and sold jewelry. He eventually decided to branch out on his own and started Joel Spitzer Associates, known as JSA Inc., where he continued to sell earrings and crosses in Florida and North Carolina. In 1985, Jeffrey joined the firm. They started as manufacturers' representatives for other companies and eventually carried their own lines.


  Spitzer loved his work and never retired.


  "My dad loved to work, he loved to travel and he loved seeing his customers," Jeffrey said. "He was always dressed to a T -- he would wear the Armani suits and the Boss suits, you know. Always a flamboyant tie."


  Jeffrey continues to operate the business.


  Spitzer loved his children and grandchildren -- Odin, Andrew, Rachael, Brandon, Tyler and Tristan. He carried pictures, often 8x10s, in his briefcase, showing them off to anyone who would take a look.


  By 1993, he had moved with Evonne to Crystal House, a Collins Avenue condo on Miami Beach. He opened an office in the 407 Lincoln Road building, which includes the famous digital clock on top. In 2000, the couple moved to an Aventura condo.


  Evonne fell ill. She suffered a brain aneurysm, colon cancer, melanoma and a broken hip. Joel, who developed lung disease, took care of everything for her. But both remained relatively healthy until her medical issues caught up with her. She broke her hip this past spring and then spent some time at an Aventura rehab facility before being sent home on April 7 without being tested for COVID-19. It turned out she had the disease.


  Soon, both were taken to Aventura Hospital, where they were given rooms just a few doors down from one another. They died just a few days later without being able to see each other.

WASHINGTON (AP) — A single House race in Montana could determine the presidential election.
 Or it could be one in Minnesota. Or Pennsylvania, Florida, Michigan or even Alaska — all districts where Speaker Nancy Pelosi has set out to not only expand the House majority but to tip party control of the states' congressional delegations in case a disputed presidential election needs to be decided by the House.
 It’s a stunning campaign strategy to match the extraordinary times. Under election law the House would intervene if the Electoral College gave no presidential candidate the majority Jan. 6. Preparing for that unthinkable reality, Pelosi is openly working to block President Donald Trump's advantage if, as he has suggested, he ties up the results of the Nov. 3 election.
 Pelosi has been issuing stark public warnings to the president not to go down down this path.
 “There ain't no light at the end of the tunnel in the House of Representatives,” Pelosi said at a recent press conference.
 “Just skip it,” she said again Tuesday in New York. “It is a train coming right down at him."

Recasts with debate, conclusion of WHO Executive Board)


  By Stephanie Nebehay


  GENEVA, Oct 6 (Reuters) - A vaccine against COVID-19 may be ready by year- end, the head of the World Health Organization said on Tuesday.


  WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus called for solidarity and political commitment by all leaders to ensure equal distribution of vaccines when they become available.


  "We will need vaccines and there is hope that by the end of this year we may have a vaccine. There is hope," Tedros said in final remarks to the WHO's Executive Board, without elaborating.


  Nine experimental vaccines are in the pipeline of the WHO's COVAX global vaccine facility that aims to distribute 2 billion doses by the end of 2021.


  The two-day board meeting, which examined the global response to the pandemic, heard calls from countries including Germany, Britain and Australia for reforms to strengthen the U.N. agency.


  U.S. President Donald Trump's administration has strongly criticised the WHO's role in the crisis, accusing it of being too close to China and not doing enough to question Beijing's actions late last year when the virus first emerged in Wuhan.


  Tedros has dismissed the suggestions and said his agency has kept the world informed.


  Three independent panels reviewing WHO performance including its 2005 International Health Regulations - which set guidelines on trade and travel restrictions imposed during health emergencies - gave updates on their work.


  The Independent Panel for Pandemic Preparedness and Response, led by former New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark and former Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, met for the first time last month.


  "We hope to get the real lessons that we can implement and prevent the same thing from happening," Tedros said. "But I would like to assure you that WHO is ready to learn from this and change this organisation.


  "During our transformation we promised this, we promised to keep change as a constant," he said, referring to his programme since taking the helm in 2017.

It is true that while employment growth has been strong before the COVID-19 pandemic, underlying inflation remained below its historical average in the euro area. Yet, that does not mean that the Phillips curve relationship is broken or that the effect of monetary policy on the real economy does not transmit to inflation. Empirical studies show that the slope of the Phillips curve is rather small in the euro area, which means that unemployment has to fall more to put pressure on inflation. We will go deeper into the subject in our monetary policy strategy review we just re-started. We will take stock of the drivers of inflation, also relating to structural developments, and assess to what extent they warrant a different approach to monetary policy decision- making.

This has been a year of challenges for those of us in the restaurant industry. The COVID-19 pandemic has contributed to an estimated $185 billion in losses in 2020, and most restaurants do not expect their business to fully recover for another six months. Many restaurant operators, perhaps as much as 30%, do not expect their businesses to survive that long.
   
 The business of restaurants is no joke. The industry can swallow an operator's soul whole and spit it back out and quickly bleed you out of cash. In a pre- pandemic world, the average operator squeezes just a 4% to 6% profit from revenue. So, when the revenue shrinks by even just a small amount, the restaurant goes into the red unless the operator pivots operations and dramatically cut costs.
   
 Even then, there is only so much one can do without the risk of shaving away the things that made the business successful. As operators, we are accustomed to quick thinking and change, but this pandemic has brought about a new level of change that none of us were expecting.
   
 Locally, we have already seen a few closures, and there are more to come. For those lucky enough to have received federal aid, that much needed support was a lifeline for the ongoing expenses during closure as well as the ability to support reopening. But what happens when those funds are depleted? We need the revenue to survive, and we need it quickly.
   
 In the downtown area of Savannah, March through June are the months where much of the money is made. We use those months to help sustain our operations and cash flow the rest of the year, but we missed those months altogether this year. It turned a little cooler this past weekend, and my first thought was not about how nice it felt but rather, how much more time do we have to capitalize on al-fresco dining? Everything is different, now.
   
 As a nation we are all hopeful that this pandemic will end. But restaurants, the heartbeat of our communities, are suffering the most.
   
 Ask any of my peers on the Georgia Restaurant Association Board of Directors what they love most about the business, and they will tell you it's the resilience, the toughness, the outright passion that we have for the industry.
   
 A glimpse of good news is that consumer comfort with eating at restaurants has hit a post-pandemic peak despite continued concerns about COVID-19. We need that support now more than ever.
   
 The consumer's ability to be patient and open-minded as we adapt and develop our businesses is critical. When dining out, follow the posted rules. If you have entered a restaurant that has a mask policy, abide by it. Many of us made promises to our staffs about the policies, procedures and rules of engagement that allowed for them to make the decision to return to work. We cannot do it without them.
   
 When you pay your bill and you see a 20% mandatory service charge instead of the ability to write in your own tip, remember that due to unemployment insurance filing guidelines, pay structure is different. While we don't want to force anything on you, we've had no choice but to adapt.
   
 Restaurants are not going away. So many Americans are connected to them -- as patrons, owners, employees, farmers or other supply chain vendors. Restaurants are more than just places to gather and eat; they are the backbone of our communities that, pre-pandemic, employed over 488,000 Georgians, equal to 11% of Georgia's population.
   
 Those who know me well have heard me say repeatedly in recent months, "This too shall pass." Indeed, it will.

NASHVILLE - Tennessee will not be returning to the team's facility Wednesday after two more players tested positive amid the NFL's first COVID-19 outbreak, and the New England Patriots have cancelled practice amid reports that a third player has tested positive for the coronavirus.
 Sports Illustrated reported that reigning NFL Defensive Player of the Year Stephon Gilmore tested positive for the virus on Wednesday and was added to the team’s reserve/COVID-19 list. The Patriots did not give a reason for Wednesday’s cancellation and did not immediately respond when asked if it was related to a third positive test.
 Quarterback Cam Newton tested positive Saturday and is on the reserve/COVID-19 list, and the Patriots placed a defensive tackle from the practice squad on that list Tuesday. The Patriots are scheduled to host Denver on Sunday.

As the NFL works not only to reduce the spread of COVID-19 between infected players but investigate potential team violations of COVID protocols, it's not out of the realm of possibility that the league could put a hold on the entire 2020 season. Asked Wednesday on NFL Network whether a temporary pause to the regular-season schedule is an option amid continued outbreak in Tennessee, as well as additional COVID cases in Las Vegas and New England, the NFL's chief medical officer confirmed as much.
 "We've said all along every option's on the table," Allen Sills told Judy Battista. "We've never taken any option off the table, which includes some type of pause or reset or any other type of alternative arrangements."
 Sills continued by saying that the NFL is currently focused on reviewing protocols and team-by-team situations while touting the research already compiled since the league instituted COVID standards during training camp.
 "Let's also keep in mind we've got nine to 10 weeks of data now, with over 400,000 tests, and we've had about 83 positive cases," Sills said. "And in the overwhelming majority of those cases, we've not seen transmissions. We've only seen it occur now in Tennessee, and possibly in New England ... We've said all along, we know this is going to be hard. This virus is a relentless opponent, it needs only a small crack. And even 90 or 95 percent compliance with our protocols is not enough. That's not a passing grade, because it still leaves a bit vulnerable."

Another, by South Korean company SD Biosensor, has been subject to scrutiny in the U.S.
 The group’s Standard Q antibody test was barred for use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The agency does not detail why tests are pulled from distribution; it can by for failing to provide sufficient data or if found not to meet the agency’s standards, among other reasons. An independent analysis of the test sponsored by the National Cancer Institute found that it had only a 76.7% total chance of correctly identifying a positive case.
 Peru’s government contends the Standard Q test it purchased is different, because it uses one test strip instead of two, though an FDA spokeswoman said that both are “very similar.”
 The state of Rhode Island purchased 20,000 SD Biosensor antibody tests in April but ended up returning them and getting a refund after the FDA barred their use.
 The SD Biosensor test – some 5 million of which have been imported to Peru, according to import records compiled by one of the nation’s leading diagnostic companies and shared with The Associated Press – is still being used there. Authorities used it both in the Cantagallo indigenous community and at least one food market in August.
 SD Biosensor and Core Technology did not respond to repeated requests for comment.

First, agreeing with the Democrats would give his enemies something they want. Pelosi wants billions for cities and states facing a double dilemma. They must spend to combat the new coronavirus but they are losing revenues doing so. Trump doesn’t want to help “blue states,” because that would make him look weak. (Bear in mind he probably believes, literally, that only Democrats live in “blue states.”) More important is the president’s need for someone to blame. This is his mess. He must clean it up, or get out of the way. He won’t get out of the way, of course, but to stay in power, he must manufacture at least a cartoon image of a scapegoat. Hence, all the talk about “badly run cities” looking for a government bailout, a talking point in keeping with the GOP’s traditional dog whistling in which “cities” is a byword for “Black.” The president is willing to hurt himself politically if it takes that to hurt the Democrats in kind.

Adds Pelosi pledge to have another stimulus bill)


  By Doina Chiacu and Richard Cowan


  WASHINGTON, Oct 6 (Reuters) - Prospects for more aid for Americans struggling through the COVID-19 pandemic and U.S. airlines seeking to avert a wave of layoffs crumbled on Tuesday when President Donald Trump ended negotiations with Congress over a large coronavirus bill.


  "I have instructed my representatives to stop negotiating until after the election when, immediately after I win, we will pass a major Stimulus Bill that focuses on hardworking Americans and Small Business," Trump wrote on Twitter a day after emerging from a hospital stay for COVID-19 treatment.


  Just days earlier, Trump had urged fast action on a fifth major coronavirus aid bill to augment the more than $3 trillion approved earlier this year.


  "OUR GREAT USA WANTS & NEEDS STIMULUS. WORK TOGETHER AND GET IT DONE," the Republican president tweeted on Saturday from the military hospital where he had been undergoing treatment.


  On Nov. 3, the United States will decide whether Trump wins a second four- year term. Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden leads Trump in national opinion polls.


  In abruptly ending negotiations on another bill to stimulate the economy, Trump insisted that the Senate instead focus exclusively on confirming Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court seat left vacant with last month's death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Barrett's confirmation would cement a 6-3 conservative majority on the court.


  The United States has an estimated 7.5 million coronavirus cases and more than 210,600 deaths, the highest in the world.


  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who had been cool to a large new aid package, told reporters he supported Trump's move. He said he thought the Republican president believed that a deal with Democrats was not in the offing and that "we need to concentrate on the achievable."


  But Republican Representative John Katko, who is from a New York district that Democrat Hillary Clinton won in the 2016 presidential election, urged Trump to reverse his decision.


  "With lives at stake, we cannot afford to stop negotiations on a relief package," Katko wrote in a tweet.


  Another Republican, Senator Susan Collins, who is in a tough re-election race in Maine, said Trump's move was a "huge mistake."


  Among the provisions that were being discussed by House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the Trump administration were a new round of direct payments to individuals like the $1,200 checks dispatched earlier this year amid huge job losses and a possible new $25 billion bailout of U.S. passenger airlines to keep tens of thousands of workers on the job for another six months.


  Following Trump's announcement breaking off negotiations, U.S. stocks reversed course to close lower. Shares of major airlines also fell.


  'COMPLETE DISARRAY'


  Pelosi, saying the White House was in "complete disarray," held a call with fellow House Democrats and raised the question of whether a steroid Trump is taking to battle his COVID-19 had clouded his judgment.


  "'Believe me, there are people ... who think that steroids have an impact on your thinking,'" Pelosi said, according to a source on the call.


  Pelosi said lawmakers would pass more aid, despite Trump's refusal to negotiate. "We will have a stimulus bill," she said in an online conversation Tuesday evening with journalist Jonathan Capehart. This could happen in the post-election "lame duck" session of Congress, or lawmakers could put coronavirus relief provisions in must-pass government spending bills, she said.


  Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin had been talking regularly over the past week as they tried to narrow the gap between a recent Democratic call for around $2.2 trillion in new spending to battle the pandemic and bolster the economy, versus about $1.6 trillion sought by the administration.


  Earlier on Tuesday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told a business conference that failure to provide further relief "would lead to a weak (economic) recovery, creating unnecessary hardship for households and businesses."


  Cleveland Federal Reserve Bank President Loretta Mester told CNBC that "the recovery will continue without it, I think, but it' s going to be a much slower recovery and it's disappointing that we didn't get a package done."


  Four weeks before the presidential and congressional elections, opinion polls show that dealing with the pandemic is a top priority of voters, many of whom think filling Ginsburg's Supreme Court seat should wait until after Election Day.


  In recent days, financial markets had been hopeful that progress toward a COVID-19 vaccine and another round of economic stimulus from Congress would boost the U.S. economy, which has been showing signs of renewed weakness.

“The school bond is important because the needs are not extravagant. They are necessities for safety and accessibility in a 100-year-old building,” Enterprise School Board President Kate Fent said. “Even more important, the district has been awarded a one-time, $4 million grant from the state that will match the bond, which translates to $8 million worth of work for a price tag of $4 million to the voters. If the bond does not pass, the district loses the grant.”
 The school bond is the most expensive, and perhaps most consequential of the measures on the ballot. If passed, the measure would fund $4 million in bonds — which would be matched by another $4 million from the state — to repair, reroof, and modernize the century-old middle school building as well as providing other improvements campus-wide. Those would include modernizing science classrooms, fixing stormwater runoff problems that are decreasing the foundational stability of some parts of the school buildings, improving and adding ADA accessibility to the buildings, and abate asbestos in the middle school.
 The 15-year bonds would be funded by an increase in property taxes of approximately $1.08 per $1,000 of assessed valuation for the first 10 years, and $0.54 per year for the last five years, according to the ballot measure text supplied by the district.
 The measure is the culmination of more than a year of study of the school’s condition and needs by consultants, the school board, and a citizen committee appointed by the board.
 “I believe it is important for the Enterprise school bond to pass to ensure the safety and security of our kids,” said Mandy Decker, a member of the school board.
 An effort to keep the measure off the ballot due to concerns about it being a tax measure rather than a school improvement bond was dismissed in Wallowa County Circuit Court last month.
 Ballot measure 32-004 would impose a Joseph city tax of 3% on the sale of marijuana items by retailers in Joseph. The tax is allowed by state law if the City Council adopts an ordinance to that effect, according to the ballot measure. The tax would be collected by the merchant at the point of sale and remitted to the city by the merchant.
 “The City Council was adamant about keeping the funds from the tax to benefit the citizens of Joseph,” Joseph Mayor Teresa Sajonia said. “The council passed resolution 201912 authoring the tax and designating that the money be used for infrastructure, parks, education, and the enhancement of the livability of the community.”
 Another ballot to be decided in November is Measure 32-003 that would require the Wallowa County commissioners to discuss interests in relocation of the Idaho border. The measure was placed on the ballot after more than 247 Wallowa County voters signed the ballot petition of Mike McCarter, president of Move Oregon’s Border.
 If passed, the measure would require the Wallowa County Board of Commissioners to meet three times annually, specifically on the second Monday of every February, June, and October, to “discuss how to promote the interests of Wallowa County in any negotiations regarding relocating the state borders of Idaho to include Wallowa County.” The measure would levy civil penalties and fines against anyone who “willfully prohibits, cancels, or hinders any of the proscribed (sic) meetings of the Board of Commissioners.”
 Wallowa County Commissioner Susan Roberts noted that the choice of required dates would mean that the commissioners would have to miss some important meetings.
 “I don’t know that folks signing that petition understood that this is what it would be,” she said. “It would force the commissioners to discuss the viability of petitioning (to join Idaho) three times a year in perpetuity.”

Pelosi said she had been working “sub-rosa” on her plan for some time but decided to go public once Trump did, too.
 “It’s sad we have to have to plan this way," she wrote in a letter to colleagues the day after his rally remarks, "but it’s what we must do to ensure the election is not stolen.”
 Under the 12th amendment to the Constitution, each of the nation’s 50 states gets one vote for president for their House delegation. The president can be selected by a House majority — 26 states — if the Electoral College deadlocks or is unable to agree on the winner. Jan. 6 is set by federal law as the date for the tabulation of the electors' votes.
 As it stands, 26 of the state congressional delegations in the House are controlled by Republicans, 22 by Democrats. Two — Pennsylvania and Michigan — are essentially tied.
 Since it’s the new Congress seated Jan. 3 that would be called on to resolve an Electoral College dispute, Democrats are eyeing states that are tied or where Republicans hold a slim majority to deny Trump’s hold on the delegations. Under Pelosi’s strategy, Democrats don't need to reach 26 states, they just need to knock Republicans down by one — to 25 — to prevent Trump from having the majority.
 Their map includes about a dozen races that dovetail with candidates in the Democrats' “Red-to-Blue” program that's trying to flip Republican-held seats, according to a Democratic strategist granted anonymity to discuss the planning.

"Our guys went diving and they came back to surface with tears on their eyes! The entire seabed was full of dead animals' corpses," a local tour guide Kristina Rozenberg wrote on her Instagram page. "All of our underwater beauty is of gray and yellow colors, the fish looks like they've been boiling in hot water... and this is all happening just 200 meters away from the house I live in."
 Initially, Kamchatka's Ministry of Natural Resources and Ecology insisted there was no such issue, saying the color of the water and the smell was normal in the area and that "nothing abnormal" had been recorded.
 That statement drew a social media backlash, which gained more traction after a post from a prominent YouTuber Yury Dud, featuring drone shots of a dark layer on the surface of the water and dozens of dead animals on the shore, went viral.
 It is still unclear what caused the contamination. Initial probes showed that levels of phenol, a substance often used as antiseptic or disinfectant, were 2.5 times higher than normal, and petroleum levels 3.6 times higher. Local media outlets have speculated about a possible oil tanker leak or military drills gone wrong, which the Defense Ministry denied.
 "The investigators are checking all possible sources of pollution, including the territories of landfills adjacent to the Avachinsky Bay and the coastal strip of Khalaktyr where toxic chemicals are stored," the Investigative Committee said in a statement.
 The Russian branch of Greenpeace pointed to a nearby toxic waste dump as a possible source of the leak. Kamchatka officials revealed Tuesday that the perimeter at Kozelsky site, which stores over 100 tons of toxic substances, including pesticides, had been breached.
 The Kamchatka governor insisted Wednesday that the area would be recultivated "no matter what."
 This is the latest in a string of ecological disasters Russia has seen in recent years, coming four months after 20,000 tons of fuel from a damaged tank poured into a nearby river in the Siberian city of Norilsk.

Local high school football players certainly felt the pain when their sport was postponed. And the promise of a season starting in March seems eerily familiar to a lot of those players.
   
 Portsmouth junior Tom McGraw thought he would be playing high school baseball last spring. The team practiced and prepped for the regular season, was told it would have to wait a while to see if the season could start a couple of weeks later than originally intended, then finally learned the season was canceled.
   
 McGraw knew everyone did their best to make spring sports happen and that COVID-19 was to blame. But it still hurt. And now for the second straight season a philosophical McGraw feels cheated again.
   
 "All athletes, regardless of level and sport, don't take anything for granted," McGraw said. "Play every play likes it's your last play because it can be taken away from you in an instant."
   
 All sports were canceled during the spring season, but football and girls volleyball are the lone fall casualties. Both sports have a chance to be played five months from now, but some of those who missed out on the chance to play their preferred fall sport opted to try another.
   
 Middletown senior Patrick Andrade, Islanders junior Jay Botelho, Rogers senior Will Farley and Portsmouth juniors Andrew Perry and McGraw -- all of whom played football last season -- are now members of their school's soccer team.
   
 "I miss football a lot. It's my senior year," Andrade said. "I also miss the kids I played with and the relationships I had with them.
   
 "I missed baseball in the spring and I haven't played soccer for four years. It was getting pretty boring just sitting around the house. I want to keep in shape for other sports and keep running as much as I can. Soccer was my only choice."
   
 Botelho, a linebacker and guard, lost his chance to play lacrosse in the spring and couldn't wait for football to start.
   
 "All summer I was doing football training at captain's practice," Botelho said. "Then I got word there would be no football this fall. The offseason has been way too long.
   
 "I knew I'd have some extra time and I've played soccer before. I like the chance to get out and kick the ball around again. But it was weird coming from the summer and going into soccer instead of football."
   
 Farley was a rare double-sport athlete in the fall. He played soccer and was the kicker on the football team his sophomore year. Last year he played just football and this year he was toying with going back to double duty.
   
 "I stepped away from soccer and focused on football last year and I don't regret my decision," Farley said. "I grew a lot more in football. This season I was thinking of doing both again.
   
 "I was really disappointed when football wasn't allowed to play, but I knew I would play soccer. If I couldn't do soccer I was going to do cross country. I knew I'd be able to play something."
   
 The change to soccer was a natural for Perry, the kicker for Portsmouth.
   
 "I've played soccer my whole life," Perry said. "I played on the middle school team and with town teams and club soccer. I just chose football when I got to high school because my brother [Connor] played. It's not very hard to get back into playing soccer."
   
 All of the athletes played soccer at some time in their young lives. Some took it more seriously than others and competed at higher levels. They're all familiar with the sport, but switching from the gridiron to the pitch still brings change.
   
 McGraw, who has been put in the striker and goalie positions, has never played soccer in high school.
   
 "Soccer is definitely a lot more conditioning," McGraw said. "Not being able to use your hands is definitely a big difference. I have a lot of things to work on. I think they put me at the positions they did because they're the two positions that you use the least amount of foot skills."
   
 "There's more running in soccer, but it's much different," Andrade said. "There's no wearing pads. And sometimes you're standing around and other times you sprint. In football, it's go on every single play."
   
 Botelho has seen some familiar faces on the Middletown soccer team as he played with and against his friends up until the eighth grade. He chose to play football instead of soccer when he entered high school and continued in the sport last season. Now he's playing catch-up on the pitch.
   
 "Soccer has been a lot of running and a lot more scrimmaging. I'm definitely rusty but just running feels good," Botelho said.
   
 Perry is falling into a familiar groove on the soccer field as he quickly gets reacquainted with the sport. He said he would definitely play football in March if that actually happens, but doesn't know what he'll do next fall if given the choice to play football or soccer.
   
 "[COVID-19] made this decision pretty easy," Perry said. "I enjoy playing soccer. It's always been in the back of my mind to switch. I have to see if I want to do it again next year or play football. I have to see how this season plays out. It's good to keep your options open."
   
 McGraw left no doubt about his allegiance.
   
 "I've always liked to stay active, I crave competition and I wanted to do something," McGraw said. "I'm still doing some team lifting with football when I'm not doing any soccer. I'm working out as much as I can. I'm playing soccer, but still focusing on football.
   
 "I miss it a lot. We made it to the championship last year. We prepared a lot for this year. We thought we could make some noise. It was really disappointing to have it taken away. It stings a little but I'll make the best of a bad opportunity."
   
 Football players around the state would love to get the chance to play a 10-week season starting in March, but know they'll have to wait and see how much of a grip coronavirus still has on Rhode Island.
   
 Farley, now a senior, is one of them.
   
 He didn't step onto a football field until he was a sophomore in high school. The chance to play again is iffy at best. Kicking a game-winning field goal for the Vikings would be a great way to finish his short career.
   
 "I don't think of myself as a football player. I fell in love with kicking," Farley said. "I'd love to play one more football game -- just one more game at Toppa. Nothing beats those Friday night lights."

Campaign signs are springing up in yards around the area as the 2020 election draws near while others are going missing.
   
 Thomas Greene reported two campaign signs stolen from his front yard on Belvedere Avenue. He went to bed Friday night, and Saturday morning his signs supporting President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence were gone, along with a sign reading, "Never Biden/Harris."
   
 "I had $45 worth of signs stolen and had to replace it with $33 more of signs," Greene said.
   
 Greene had signs supporting other conservative candidates in his front lawn, but those were left undisturbed.
   
 Just down the road on Marion Street supporters of former Vice-President Joe Biden are reporting similar incidents of signs being taken.
   
 "What's the point," said Michelle Roberts.
   
 Just a week earlier, signs at her father's home in Patterson Springs were taken off his lawn. The taking of his signs prompted the family to take precautions with their own, so Robert's positioned the signs to be firmly on their property and up a small incline.
   
 It still didn't stop them from being taken.
   
 "Somebody stopped their car or walked all the way onto our property just to take them," she said.
   
 Roberts was a bit dumbfounded that someone would trespass on a person's property and take something just because of a political sign.
   
 And missing signs are happening in other areas of the county.
   
 Angela Woods, a candidate for district court judge in Cleveland County, has also noticed that several of her signs have gone missing in Kings Mountain and Boiling Springs.
   
 "I had a friend over in Boiling Springs call me and say her sign, that was on private property, was taken on Friday or Saturday," the Democratic candidate said.
   
 Woods found out last week that several campaign signs displayed at rights-of- way in Kings Mountain were taken and some were thrown several dozen feet away on top of a hill, she said.
   
 Director of the Cleveland County Board of Elections Clifton Philbeck said those seem to be isolated incidents.
   
 "I really have not heard anything about signs being taken," he said.
   
 Signs being removed and outright taken is a class three misdemeanor, according to North Carolina state law.
   
 Sometimes signs could be removed from areas because they are not allowed to be there according to North Carolina and county ordinances on signs being displayed. In Cleveland County, signs cannot be displayed on public property like in city parks, municipal buildings and telephone poles. Campaign signs can be displayed on private property and some rights-of-way along stretches of roads, according to
   
 Philbeck has compiled a 26-page document that outlines the state and county ordinances.
   
 "People running each get a packet on where signs can and cannot be displayed," Philbeck said.
   
 Woods, Greene and Roberts said they are all disappointed that these thefts have occurred.
   
 "I respect other people's opinion, and I wouldn't take the signs from them," Green said.
   
 Green has replaced his signs and relocated them into a sun room on his property. Woods is debating replacing them.
   
 She will be getting her friend a new one, but with each sign costing $5-$6 apiece, Woods is looking where she will place her signs for early voting and will see if she has enough to replace the others.
   
 "I'm just hoping no more will go missing," she said.

LOS ANGELES -- George Springer hit two home runs and the Houston Astros crushed their way to within one victory of their fourth consecutive American League Championship Series, beating the Oakland A's 5-2 Tuesday at Dodger Stadium.


  Martin Maldonado also hit a home run as the Astros went deep three times, one day after hitting another three homers in Game 1 of the AL Division Series. Houston will look to sweep the best-of-three series on Wednesday.


  Astros starter Framber Valdez (2-0) gave up two runs on five hits over seven innings. He walked one and struck out four.


  Khris Davis and Chad Pinder hit home runs for the A's, who now need to win three consecutive games in order to advance to the ALCS starting Sunday at San Diego.


  The Astros and A's have combined for 11 home runs in two games of the series. By comparison, the Los Angeles Dodgers and Milwaukee Brewers played two National League wild-card games in the same venue last week and combined for two homers.


  Springer's two-homer day followed a multi-homer performance from teammate Carlos Correa on Monday. Springer has six hits in the series, and coupled with his show-stopping performance in the 2017 World Series, he is 13-for-26 (.500) with five home runs and nine RBIs in six career playoff games at Dodger Stadium.


  Davis put the A's on top 1-0 in the second inning with his second home run of the series, but Springer topped that with a two-run shot into left-center in the third. Springer's blast came two batters after a Josh Reddick single.


  In the fourth inning, the Astros took a 3-1 lead on a one-out ground ball from Correa that the A's were unable to turn into an inning-ending double play because Houston's Kyle Tucker was breaking from first base on the pitch.


  The A's pulled to within a run in the fourth inning when Pinder hit a blast into the empty stands in right-center.


  The Astros moved ahead 4-2 in the fifth on Maldonado's home run that knocked Oakland starter Sean Manaea from the game. On the first pitch from A's reliever Yusmeiro Petit, Springer hit one over the wall in left.


  Manaea (0-1) gave up four runs on five hits over 4 1/3 innings with one walk and two strikeouts.


  Houston's bullpen followed five hitless innings in Game 1 with two scoreless innings in Game 2. Right-hander Ryan Pressley finished off Oakland in the ninth inning for his second save of the postseason.

Dividend investing is also considered a good investment strategy because it allows you to take advantage of compounding. In a nutshell, compounding refers to a method in which you can increase your income by using your earnings to get more of them later on. When you invest in dividend stocks, you can use your dividend earnings to buy additional stocks of the company. And the more you purchase stocks, the more you can increase your regular dividend payout.

Adds Democratic reaction, stock market reaction, other details)
 By Doina Chiacu and Richard Cowan
 WASHINGTON, Oct 6 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday called off negotiations with Democratic lawmakers on coronavirus relief legislation until after the election, even as cases of the virus are on the rise across much of the country before flu season.
 "I have instructed my representatives to stop negotiating until after the election when, immediately after I win, we will pass a major Stimulus Bill that focuses on hardworking Americans and Small Business," Trump wrote on Twitter a day after emerging from a hospital stay for COVID-19 treatment.
 U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Trump's decision to pull the plug on negotiations showed that the White House was in "complete disarray."
 Trump's surprise move came after Pelosi on Sunday said during an interview with NBC's "Face the Nation" that progress was being made in her negotiations with the Trump administration on a bill to build on the more than $3 trillion in coronavirus aid enacted into law earlier this year.
 Earlier on Tuesday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told a business conference the U.S. economic expansion was "far from complete" following the deep contraction stemming from the pandemic.
 A failure by the United States to provide further relief, Powell warned, "would lead to a weak recovery, creating unnecessary hardship for households and businesses."
 Among the provisions that were being discussed by Pelosi and the Trump administration was a new round of direct payments to individuals like the $1,200 checks dispatched earlier this year amid huge job losses.
 Following Trump's announcement breaking off negotiations, U.S. stocks reversed course to close lower on Tuesday.
 Trump's move, less than one month before the Nov. 3 presidential and congressional elections, was met with a fierce backlash from Democrats, especially since he instructed Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to instead focus full efforts on Senate confirmation of Amy Coney Barrett to fill a vacant Supreme Court seat.
 Public opinion polls indicate that dealing with the pandemic is a top priority of voters, many of whom think filling the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's Supreme Court seat should wait until after Nov. 3.
 "He would rather let jobless people go hungry just so he can steal a Supreme Court seat," said Democratic Representative Ilhan Omar in a Twitter posting.
 In recent days, financial markets were hopeful progress toward a COVID-19 vaccine and another round of economic stimulus from Congress would boost the U.S. economy, which has been showing signs of renewed weakness.
 Following Trump's hospitalization for treatment of his COVID-19 infection, there also was speculation that that could provide impetus within the Trump administration to cut a quick deal with Democrats on another pandemic aid bill.
 Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin had been talking regularly over the past week or so as they attempted to narrow the gap between a recent Democratic call for around $2.2 trillion in new spending to battle the pandemic and bolster the economy, versus around $1.6 trillion sought by the administration.
 It was not clear whether enough Senate Republicans would have gotten behind any deal, however.
 The White House said it had no further comment.
 There are an estimated 7.5 million coronavirus cases diagnosed in the United States and more than 210,600 deaths, the highest in the world.

A day after three members of Sube Gujjar's gang were arrested after a brief exchange of gunfire in Sohna, police said probe has revealed that the main sharpshooter of Gujjar's gang, Rajesh Kumar alias Fauji had recently formed a 'sleeper cell' of shooters and recruited the two arrested suspects, Kamal alias Kamli, 32, and Aman alias Sardar. Two policemen and both the arrested suspects were injured in the shootout.


  Police said on the directions of Sube Gujjar, Fauji had formed the cell and their target was to commit a series of crimes, starting with the murder of a property dealer in Dhunela on Tuesday, to establish supremacy. Investigators said that other gang members in Gujjar's gang were unaware of the recruitment of these 'silent' sharp shooters.


  The trio had conducted a recce for two days and assembled a cache of weapons for the murder, but they were arrested after the crime branch sector 39 received a tip-off. Two pistols, two revolvers, a country-made gun, 110 live cartridges, a backpack, and a motorcycle were allegedly recovered from the possession of the suspects.


  Police said after the arrests of most of his associates, Sube Gujjar, a former sharpshooter of gangster Kaushal, has assumed leadership of the Kaushal gang in the last one year. Gujjar has a reward of Rs 5 lakh for information leading to his arrest. Fauji was Gujjar's right hand man and most trusted aide, who kept him informed of the gang's activities, said police.


   


   


  Fauji has been deemed as a bad character -- a person with a history of crime -- at Sadar police station and is accused in 18 criminal cases, including several murders, extortions and loots in a career that spans over two decades. A resident of Naharpur Rupa, Fauji took to crime in 1998 and was arrested for the first time in 2001 for a conspiracy to loot. Over the next five years, he rose through the ranks and along with Kaushal and Sube, was involved in several gang wars, including murder of gangster Shailu in 2006.


  From 2006 to 2008, a period when Gurugram witnessed several inter-gang shootings, he was accused in at least four murders and attempt to murder cases, before he was arrested by Delhi Police's special cell from Bhiwadi. He continued to operate his activities from jail later. More recently in 2019, he was accused in the murder of a nambardar (an official who maintains and verifies land records) in Manesar and murder of a cleric in Hathin.


  The second suspect, Kamal alias Kamli, a resident of village Badha in Kherki Daula, was a school bus driver till three years ago. He is a cousin of Fauji and was allegedly recruited by him. Police said he had allegedly committed two murders on the direction of Gujjar and his involvement in the gang was always kept under the wraps. He only reported to Gujjar and Fauji. The third aide, Aman alias Sardar, a native of Ludhiana, used to be an auto rickshaw driver and later started smuggling liquor for Fauji. He too was recruited on Gujjar's directions for the purpose of carrying out a spate of murders.


  Preet Pal, assistant commissioner of police (ACP), crime, said, "The entire gang and their aides are on the radar of the police and we are hopeful of getting them all behind bars. The three arrested persons are undergoing treatment at a hospital in Sohna and shall be taken into custody after they are discharged."

Overall, the state had 1,309 new cases Wednesday, the most since May 8 on the downside of the spring peak while the state remained in the red level.
 Each day's report is a snapshot of the previous day.
 The red, yellow, green coding was deemed unnecessary by Gov. Tom Wolf after contact tracing and other precautions were initiated by the state in late June. At that time, the new case load was half of the current level.
 The seven- and 14-day averages for Berks were again on the rise at 43 and 39, respectively, heading toward a second fall peak. Both peaked Sept. 17 at 47 and 41, respectively, mainly due to the Kutztown University outbreak.
 However, the KU outbreak has been reduced to a trickle and the latest surge is showing up on all ZIP codes in Berks.
 Those same averages were in the 20s in August. The averages smooth the uneven reporting of test results.
 The state seven-day average is nearing 1,100 for the first time since early May and the red level. Much of the recent statewide surge is fueled by the Penn State University Park outbreak, which has reached 2,964 cases with 2,461 recoveries, and still 156 students in isolation, the college reported Wednesday.
 No deaths have been reported at University Park.

  LOS ANGELES, Oct 6 (Reuters) - Eddie Van Halen, one of rock music's greatest guitar players and a founding member of the hard-rocking, top-selling band named after him and his drummer brother, died of cancer on Tuesday. He was 65.


  Van Halen's death was announced on Twitter by his 29-year-old son, Wolfgang, himself a bass player who joined the band in later years. Representatives for Eddie Van Halen directed Reuters to his son's statement.


  "I can't believe I'm having to write this but my father, Edward Lodewijk Van Halen, has lost his long and arduous battle with cancer this morning," Wolfgang Van Halen said in the tweet.


  "He was the best father I could ever ask for," the younger Van Halen said. "Every moment I've shared with him on and off stage was a gift."


  Actress Valerie Bertinelli, Eddie Van Halen's former wife of 26 years and Wolfgang's mother, retweeted the Twitter statement by her son.


  "My heart is broken. Eddie was not only a Guitar God, but a genuinely beautiful soul," Gene Simmons, lead singer of the band Kiss, said on Twitter.


  Eddie Van Halen was born in Amsterdam in 1955 and studied classical piano after moving with his family to the Los Angeles suburb of Pasadena in the early 1960s.


  After switching to guitar, he and his older brother Alex, who had taken up the drums, formed the early bands that would eventually become Van Halen in the 1970s, with lead singer David Lee Roth and bass player Michael Anthony.


  The hard rock band, featuring Eddie Van Halen's explosive guitar solos, quickly became a staple of the famed Sunset Strip music scene in Los Angeles before releasing their eponymous debut album in 1978.


  That album shot to No. 19 on the Billboard charts, becoming one of the most successful debuts of the decade.


  It was the first in a string of top-selling albums that would make Van Halen one of the biggest rock acts of the late 1970s and early 1980s with hits like "Ain't Talkin' 'Bout Love," "Jump," "Panama" and "Hot for Teacher."


  Eddie Van Halen's pioneering, virtuoso technique earned him a place along the likes of Jimi Hendrix, Eric Clapton and Jimmy Page of Led Zeppelin as one of rock's top guitarists. In 2012 a Guitar World magazine poll of readers voted him the greatest guitar player of all time.


  Roth split from the band in 1984 and was replaced for a decade by Sammy Hagar.


  "Heartbroken and speechless. My love to the family," Hagar said in a tweet.
