The Isle of Wight's Green Party - which has nine locally-elected councillors - has also expressed its doubts.
 "The Isle of Wight has a significantly older and more vulnerable population [and] the island's one hospital could be overwhelmed if... people feel they do no need to stick to lockdown measures due to the rolling out of this app," it said.
 But the government's coordinator for testing said the island was "well- equipped" to cope.
 "It's quite a large population and there is a benefit in the fact that travel on and off the island is relatively restricted - the ferries are there, but they're running relatively infrequently," added Public Health England's Prof John Newton.
 "So it is an ideal place to look at the epidemiology and see the impact."

CHARLESTON — U.S. Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Susan Collins, R-Maine, have urged U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue, to halt a proposal that would put food assistance benefits at risk for 3.1 million individuals, including 25,000 in West Virginia.
 Manchin and Collins urged USDA, in light of the deepening public health and economic crisis, to immediately suspend rule-making on the proposal, which was originally published last July.
 “As millions of Americans face increased food insecurity as a result of COVID-19, we write today to highlight the importance of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program as a vital safety net for families who are struggling to navigate these challenging times. We believe it would be an irresponsible step backwards for the Administration to proceed with any proposal to dramatically limit eligibility or decrease benefits during this pandemic or the economic recovery,” the Senators said in part.

Joan Shankin stopped by her small preschool Friday morning to feed the fish and disinfect the play mats.
 Typically, Children’s Garden Montessori School enrolls about 50 kids ages 18 months to 5 years. Shankin, who started the nonprofit early childhood center 14 years ago and serves as its director, said in all of April, it cared for just one child for three days.
 Starting Monday, however, five or six children of workers in industries considered essential during the COVID-19 pandemic will be attending the school.
 “Some parents who are essential workers called and said the situation is more than they can manage, so they need support,” Shankin said.
 Parents were told their children must stay home if they are showing any symptoms of sickness, and Shankin will take the temperature of each child on arrival, at lunchtime and when they leave for the day. Fever is one of the first signs of COVID-19, a viral respiratory illness.
 “We’re going to take temperatures and clean everything and hope for the best,” Shankin said. “I just hope none of these kids come to school with the virus.”
 Since cases of the novel coronavirus, which causes COVID-19, began emerging in New Mexico in mid-March, child care centers and preschools across the state have seen a massive drop in demand. The governor’s public health order requiring schools and many businesses to close and urging residents to remain at home as much as possible put tens of thousands of workers out of jobs and led to thousands more working remotely from their homes.
 Even parents who continue working in essential services have kept their kids at home to help keep them safe from the virus.
 Elizabeth Groginsky, secretary of the state’s new Early Childhood Education and Care Department, said around 400 child care centers in New Mexico have closed their doors in recent weeks. Some 500 that have stayed open are serving only 15 percent to 30 percent of the children they normally would enroll.
 United Way of Santa Fe County, which provides prekindergarten programs for about 100 3- and 4-year-olds, is one of many organizations that have closed their child care campuses in Santa Fe. In late March, United Way saw a surge in demand as other pre-Ks shut down. It announced it was opening additional slots for the children of health care workers and first responders under a state initiative expanding tuition-free pre-K during the pandemic.
 But demand then plummeted until there were too few children attending United Way’s Early Learning Center at Kaune to keep it open, Executive Director Katherine Freeman said.
 “When we first opened up these slots, there was lots of demand. We had a waiting list,” Freeman said. “Then people starting losing their jobs and getting laid off. We helped some parents pursue other options, and that demand diminished.”
 Jennifer Salinas, director of early learning at United Way, said just under half the Kaune center’s students have continued learning from home through online platforms.
 Other pre-K centers in the city, such as Santa Fe Community College’s Kids Campus, also have been reaching children through distance-learning programs.
 It hasn’t been easy, Salinas said.
 “The biggest struggle is just families having time and energy to do it,” she said, “especially those with older children in the public schools who are required to keep up with online learning. “Our stuff gets put on the back burner.”
 Despite the recent struggles for day care and pre-K providers, many have been able to keep workers on the payroll even while centers are shut down.
 Some providers have received forgivable loans from the federal Paycheck Protection Program, an economic stimulus initiative to aid businesses and workers during the pandemic.
 The state government also has continued reimbursing providers that serve low- income families who receive government-funded child care assistance, even if those kids are not on campus.
 “We have continued to pay contracts for children regardless if a center is closed,” Groginsky said. “We’re paying based on enrollment, not attendance.”
 On Friday, the state announced it also would use some of its federal pandemic- related stimulus funding to begin offering hazard pay to child care workers who are serving children of essential employees — many of whom are on the front lines of the pandemic and at high risk of contracting the novel coronavirus. Full-time early childhood workers will be eligible for $700 per month for each month they have worked between April and June, the state said, while part-time workers will be eligible for $350 per month.
 An additional $12 million in grants will be available for licensed child care providers who have been affected by the public health crisis, the state said.
 Shankin said Children’s Garden Montessori, which receives half its revenue from privately paid tuition and half from state reimbursements, has been able to continue paying all six of its full-time teachers.
 State Rep. Rebecca Dow, a Truth or Consequences Republican who founded the preschool AppleTree Educational Center more than 20 years ago, said child care workers, some of the lowest-paid employees in the state, deserve a boost.
 “It’s clearly an essential service,” Dow said. “Right now, we’re serving truckers, grocery store employees, Walmart and gas station workers, and, of course, health care workers from our veterans center and nursing home.”
 She noted the average child care worker in New Mexico earns $11.80 per hour, less than the city of Santa Fe’s minimum wage of $12.10.
 “We need to raise pay for the long-term sustainability of our child care system,” Dow said.
 Groginsky said raising pay for the early childhood workforce is one of her primary goals for the new department.

Every time someone mentioned Gallup, I first thought of the brave one — Hiroshi “Hershey” Miyamura.
 Nothing has changed.
 The coronavirus pandemic that has forced a lockdown of the city of 22,000 is still secondary to the story and spirit of Miyamura.
 A resident of Gallup for most of his 94 years, Miyamura would disagree with me. He never considered himself the central character in any story. Miyamura would say he did his duty, no more and no less.
 Like most recipients of the Medal of Honor, America’s highest award for valor in combat, Miyamura is as humble as he is courageous.
 And never did he show a trace of bitterness, even though he grew up in a segregated society that could be both dangerous and cruel. The U.S. Army refused to accept Miyamura when he first tried to serve his country, classifying him as “an enemy alien.”
 Gallup was different, a safe haven that didn’t treat him or his family as outsiders.
 Miyamura’s parents settled in Gallup in 1923. They started a small business that served lunches from a stand. Hershey was born two years later. Gallup was his kind of town, a place teeming with immigrants.
 After the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor in 1941, about 120,000 Japanese- Americans on the Pacific Coast were forced from their homes and businesses and herded into relocation camps. Some of these camps were in New Mexico.
 Fear and prejudice were rampant, but Gallup residents kept a cool head and defied convention. They didn’t round up or harass the two dozen Japanese families that lived in town.
 Miyamura was 16 when the attack on Pearl Harbor occurred. Weeks afterward, he saw a train crammed with Japanese Americans rumble through Gallup. The people on board were headed for the camps, stripped of everything but their dignity and the clothes they wore.
 Like so many who were determined to prove their loyalty to America, Miyamura wanted to serve in the military. After his initial rejection, he was accepted into the U.S. Army and as part of the Nisei 442nd Regimental Combat Team. The United States won World War II soon after.
 Back home in Gallup, Miyamura reenlisted in the Army Reserve Corps. His generation had its second war soon after, this one in Korea.
 By then, President Harry Truman had desegregated the military. Miyamura shipped out for combat duty.
 On the night of April 24, 1951, Cpl. Miyamura was a machine gun squad leader of an infantry unit that came under attack in Taejon-ni, Korea.
 What happened next has awed generations of soldiers. Miyamura’s Medal of Honor citation chronicles his movements:
 “Aware of the imminent danger to his men, [Miyamura] unhesitatingly jumped from his shelter wielding his bayonet in close hand-to-hand combat, killing approximately 10 of the enemy. Returning to his position, he administered first aid to the wounded and directed their evacuation.
 “As another savage assault hit the line, he manned his machine gun and delivered withering fire until his ammunition was expended. He ordered the squad to withdraw while he stayed behind to render the gun inoperative. He then bayoneted his way through infiltrated enemy soldiers to a second gun emplacement and assisted in its operation.”
 Fierce and heavy fighting continued. Miyamura ordered his men to fall back as he provided cover for them.
 “He killed more than 50 of the enemy before his ammunition was depleted and he was severely wounded,” his citation states.
 Miyamura spent 28 months in a North Korean prisoner-of-war camp. Because of the coronavirus, New Mexico has been under emergency health restrictions for about eight weeks.
 Miyamura worried about his men while he was imprisoned. He wondered how many had died. His weight dropped below 100 pounds, and the idea of ever seeing Gallup again seemed far-fetched.
 Released from the prison camp on Aug. 20, 1953, Miyamura learned from a brigadier general that he had been awarded the Medal of Honor. The Army had not made this public until Miyamura was freed, fearing the North Koreans would seek revenge on him if they learned of his combat record.
 President Dwight Eisenhower presented Miyamura with the Medal of Honor, and Gallup welcomed him home.
 Miyamura ran a gas station in the town for many years. A pillar in Gallup stands in tribute to his service in the Korean War, and a high school is named in his honor. The teams at Miyamura High School are called the Patriots.
 This lockdown is tough on everyone in Gallup. Yet there’s still opportunity to go to the store for supplies, watch television, use the internet and step outside for fresh air.
 Hershey lived through worse and never forgot about his buddies. That’s why his story matters as much as ever.

Germany's football league insisted Monday the mass testing of players and backroom staff was "providing protection" after 10 cases of coronavirus across the top two divisions raised questions about whether it will get the green light to resume matches this month.
 On Monday, the German Football League (DFL) reported that out of 1,724 tests, 10 had returned a positive result, three of which are already known to involve Bundesliga side Cologne.
 "The tests carried out over the past few days have fulfilled their purpose of providing additional safety and thus protecting players as best as possible from infection during team training or matches," the DFL said in a statement.
 The positive results, around 0.5 percent of the total, all came from the first batch of tests as the German league prepares to resume from the weekend of May 16 in empty stadiums and with strict hygiene measures.
 The league's plans to become the first major European football competition to restart since the season was halted in mid-March hinge on the regular testing of players.
 The DFL did not specify which clubs the positive tests came from, but the individuals concerned have immediately been quarantined and the local health authorities informed.
 \- Decision due Wednesday -
 The news of the positive tests comes as the league is hoping to get the green light to resume from Chancellor Angela Merkel's federal government on Wednesday.
 According to the regulations in force in Germany, anyone who has been in contact with a positive case of coronavirus must observe a 14-day isolation period.
 Horst Seehofer, Germany's interior minister who has responsibility for sport, has said he supports the plans for Bundesliga teams to finish its interrupted season.
 However, on Monday Seehofer's ministry football would not be allowed to deviate from the rules for the wider population.
 "Horst Seehofer stands by what he said -- anyone who has been in direct contact with a person who has tested positive must be quarantined for 14 days," interior ministry spokesman Steve Alter said.
 "This is a principle that applies to the whole population and there is no reason why it should be any different for professional footballers."
 The league's plans to resume state that clubs are able to continue training even if a squad member or coach tests positive for the coronavirus and is quarantined.
 Germany's top clubs are desperate for the season to be completed by June 30 in order to claim a 300 million euros ($325 million) instalment of money due from the league's television contract.
 Thirteen of the 36 clubs in the top two leagues are reportedly under severe financial pressure due to the pandemic.
 Some politicians also want league games switched from pay-per-view broadcaster Sky to state channels to encourage fans to stay at home and not gather to watch matches in public places which have a subscription.
 RB Leipzig, who were third in the table behind leaders Bayern Munich when the league halted, are planning to keep their squad in semi-quarantine on their training grounds should games resume.
 They will "possibly spend the night here as well. This is still being discussed," Leipzig's German international defender Marcel Halstenberg told broadcaster MDR.
 \- Kalou criticised -
 Not all players are following the strict hygiene measures.
 In a video he posted to Facebook on Monday, former Chelsea striker Salomon Kalou greeted Hertha Berlin team-mates and staff with handshakes, breaking guidelines to avoid contact and earning the league's wrath.
 "The pictures of Salomon Kalou from the Hertha dressing room are absolutely unacceptable," the DFL said.
 The German league is aware that its plans are under scrutiny.
 Anja Stahmann, chairwoman of German's state ministers for sport, called for "the greatest possible transparency" from the DFL.
 She also added fuel to the debate about whether the league should resume.
 "In public, people are rightly saying - 'why should football resume behind locked doors yet religious services are still banned?'," the Bremen-based politician told Deutschlandfunk radio.
 "Why are the playgrounds closed, but millionaires are allowed to play football?"

Taylor Gantt feels like a first-time graduation organizer all over again.
 He’s not alone.
 Gantt, president of St. Michael’s High School, said he has helped coordinate graduation ceremonies “about 15 to 20 times,” but that experience is being put to the test when it comes to this year’s event.
 Graduation is the latest tradition affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. High school administrators across the state are forced to rethink how to carry out this time-honored rite of passage for the class of 2020 while following state restrictions imposed to slow the spread of the illness.
 Some graduations have been pushed to June or even later. And school administrators acknowledge the delays don’t guarantee they will be able to hold traditional gatherings for commencement ceremonies.
 Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham has said large gatherings will be prohibited for the foreseeable future.
 So, out with the cap-tossing.
 For most members of the class of 2020, there will be “virtual graduations” or drive-thru diploma ceremonies.
 “We’re thinking and talking about things that we would have never thought about otherwise,” Gantt said. “It’s kind of fun; it’s kind of exciting because innovation is the name of the game.”
 Just don’t tell that to parents and students, who already are clamoring for their traditional moment in the sun.
 While most schools have not yet finalized their plans, Santa Fe Public Schools announced Friday it will hold “virtual ceremonies” in June for the graduates of its five high schools — Santa Fe High, Capital High, Early College Opportunities, Mandela International Magnet School and the Academy at Larragoite. Officials said they will feature speeches by dignitaries, valedictorians and salutatorians, as well as class songs and a picture gallery of all seniors as they are acknowledged.
 Also, graduates and their family members will partake in a “grab-and-go” ceremony the following day, in which they will drive by their respective schools to receive their diploma and be photographed.
 Santa Fe High Principal Carl Marano said his school also is trying to do other things to honor graduates, such as creating T-shirts and hanging banners along Siringo Road and Llano Street congratulating seniors. Marano said administrators and faculty members want students to know this is still a special time for them.
 “We know they are going through so much,” Marano said. “This high school experience is such a memorable one, from prom to graduation to homecoming to everything you get to experience. Not having some of these opportunities is devastating for our students.”
 The response to the school district’s decision was ice-cold. District Superintendent Veronica García said she received roughly 500 complaints about the graduation plan, so she amended it to add an in-person graduation and a prom along with the current plan.
 The caveat, though, was the in-person events could only happen when Lujan Grisham allows for such a large gathering, which would likely have around 1,000 people in attendance at Santa Fe High and Capital.
 “It’s their graduation; it’s about them,” García said. “It’s not about the school district. Yeah, it might cost us a little bit, but it’s not exorbitant. We just want to do right by the kids.”
 She is not alone in those efforts.
 Jim Leonard, head of school for Santa Fe Preparatory School, said he still is working with faculty and seniors on finding the best way to honor them.
 One thing that won’t happen at Prep, Leonard said, is a virtual ceremony.
 The private school’s sense of community among students, parents, faculty and staff is important to maintain and honor, he said.
 Leonard also wanted to provide some sense of normalcy for the 47 students who are on track to graduate. He considered holding a commencement ceremony in the campus’s upper quad while adhering to social-distancing measures. He even enlisted a math teacher to help him come up with an outline of how to pull it off, but to no avail.
 “It looks like we’re 15 percent short of that,” Leonard said of the space.
 The school will send a form to students seeking their input on a proper ceremony, he said.
 Santa Fe Prep might hold commencements in early June on Brennand Field, with families of graduates standing at a safe distance. Leonard also proposed the idea of pushing the ceremony to August, when it might be safer to hold an event.
 He feels a ceremony could be held safely and with a limited amount of people — probably no more than 150 people if it were on the field.
 Regardless of the plan Prep settles on, Leonard said this graduation will not be like any other he’s witnessed. This will be his final commencement ceremony; Leonard is stepping down from his post at the conclusion of the school year.
 “We recognize that the typical Prep graduation is not going to happen,” Leonard said. “That’s Grandma and Grandpa flying in from Topeka [Kan.]. It’s just not going to happen this summer.”
 That tradition is one of many that will fall by the wayside. Gantt said many St. Michael’s seniors are disappointed the school won’t hold its graduation at the Cathedral Basilica of St. Francis of Assisi. He hoped their feedback during a Friday session would give him and the administration some ideas on how to make this year’s event special in its own way.
 “For a lot of them, their older brothers and sisters did it, their parents did it and so it’s a big deal,” Gantt said. “A lot of them are having a hard time seeing anything other than that because that part of [being at] St. Mike’s is so special.”
 Interim Superintendent Debra Sena Holton at Pecos Independent Schools said the district’s practice of walking Pecos High School graduates in cap and gown past the elementary school students toward the end of the school year probably will not happen, which she finds heartbreaking because the younger students look up to them.
 Sena Holton said she hopes the school can hold a ceremony on its track and field complex May 30, but the more likely scenario is that it will happen in June. What it will look like is still to be determined.
 In the meantime, Sena Holton said she and the rest of the faculty and staff at Pecos are trying to keep seniors’ spirits up even as those valued rituals fall by the wayside.
 “A parent talked to me earlier this week, and somebody spoke to her son,” Sena Holton said. “He came up to her and said, ‘Mom, they called me “one of those seniors.” And it hit him really hard, like, ‘You know what? This isn’t going away. We’re going to miss our big day.’ ”

Gulp fiction
   
 HH
   
 How much you enjoy "Frank Miller's Sin City," an ultraviolent fanboy freak show, may depend on how many piercings you have.
   
 The film, an adaptation of Miller's 1991 cult comics, is stylish and visually daring. Miller is, after all, the artist who revived Batman with his epochal "Dark Knight" series.
   
 But this "Sin City" movie is also a half-hour too long, brutal, crude and relentlessly juvenile, a work designed to appeal to the antisocial 13-year-old inside all of us.
   
 Co-directed by Robert Rodriquez of "Spy Kids" fame and Miller and "guest directed," whatever that means, by Quentin Tarantino, the film recalls Stanley Kubrick's 1971 classic "A Clockwork Orange" in terms of transgressive content and Warren Beatty's "Dick Tracy" (1990) in its outre visual stylings.
   
 The three-part action takes place in a noirish, black-and-white universe. But it's black-and-white with shockingly lush splashes of color, a style Rodriguez ("Once Upon a Time in Mexico," "From Dusk 'til Dawn") derives from his source.
   
 In opening scenes reminiscent of a Calvin Klein ad, Josh Hartnett appears as a handsome hitman. The dialogue is self-consciously hard-boiled, and everything is black and white, except a beautiful babe's iconic red dress and blood-red lips.
   
 Like Tarantino's "Pulp Fiction" and "Kill Bill," films Rodriguez obviously admires, "Sin City" veers back and forth between different, overlapping story lines, all set in Miller's crime-ridden, film-noir hellhole Basin City.
   
 In the first, Bruce Willis is John Hartigan, a cop with a "bum ticker" and a jagged, cross-shaped scar on his forehead. John risks his life to save an 11-year-old damsel from a rapist/killer (Nick Stahl) who is the son of a U.S. senator.
   
 Willis, whose boxer persona is the linchpin of "Pulp Fiction," does not serve a similar steadying role here in large part because the character is so implausible. Hartigan is supposed to be "pushing 60" when he stops the serial killer, castrating him with a shot from his cannon-sized revolver.
   
 When the action resumes eight years later, Hartigan must be pushing 70, and yet the now 19-year-old girl, now a stripper (affectless Jessica Alba), longs to go to bed with him. At the same time, the hideously deformed killer known as Yellow Bastard has regrown his naughty bits and is still after her.
   
 The second section features Mickey Rourke with a prosthetic nose and chin in which he resembles the unforgettable actor Rondo Hatton of "The Creeper" film series of the 1940s.
   
 Rourke is Marv, a brutish street fighter with the ability to dish out and take tremendous punishment and leap off tall buildings. When Marv's latest bedmate Goldie (Jaime King) is killed, he goes on a rampage to avenge her. The rampage involves beatings, shootings, a hospital stay and a visit to his naked parole officer (Carla Gugino, the mother in "Spy Kids").
   
 In a thin, third tale, which includes a sequence directed by Tarantino, Clive Owen is Dwight, a surly yet suave private investigator trying to protect Old Town's S & M-costumed hookers, including statuesque ex-girlfriend Gail (eye- poppingly Amazonian Rosario Dawson), after they mistakenly kill a cop (Benicio del Toro). This segment also features Miho (Devon Aoki), a "Kill Bill"-like warrior woman armed with a samurai sword.
   
 In addition to ugly costumes and hairstyles, Rodriguez, who served as cinematographer and visual effects supervisor, has assembled an all-star team of heavyweight screen bruisers: Willis, Rourke, del Toro, Powers Boothe, Michael Madsen and Rutger Hauer as the loathesome prelate Cardinal Roark.
   
 However weak their material, these guys leave big footprints on the screen. Rodriguez also wittily casts the world's favorite hobbit (Elijah Wood) as a murderous cannibal who eats one victim's surgically removed hand in front of her and mounts his other female victims' heads on his wall (only one of the film's flagrantly misogynistic "touches"). Many of the automobiles in this noir universe are vintage Ferraris - works of art on wheels. In the film's most memorably lyrical scene, Marv drives his car off a pier and claws his way to the surface as the automobile, its lights still on, sinks into the abyss.
   
 Tarantino and Rodriguez may be on the same wavelength. But Tarantino is much smarter. He understands how Pam Grier movies trade in both T & A and feminist allegory. Rodriguez can't see past the T & A, and his actors here give wildly divergent performances. In the Gloria Graham-like, tough-cookie waitress role Brittany Murphy is just grating, and a turn by Michael Clarke Duncan ("The Green Mile") is entirely superfluous.
   
 "Sin City" made me ask if my life would have been complete without seeing Bruce Willis rip a guy's genitals off (yes).
   
 There's nothing wrong with pandering to that feral child crouching inside us all. Much of pop culture does. But after a while, that little creep really gets on my nerves.

Arsenal could lose Alexandre Lacazette in the summer as the Frenchman has been getting information on Atletico Madrid from his international teammate, Antoine Griezmann reveals Spanish outlet Mundo Deportivo.
 Lacazette has fallen down the pecking order at the Emirates because of the emergence of Eddie Nketiah, who seems to have what Mikel Arteta needs.
 He has claimed that he is happy to remain at the Emirates, but if he continues to be behind the England teenager, he might push for a move away.
 One team that has been interested in signing him has been Atletico Madrid and the Spaniards have maintained their interest in the former Lyon man.
 This latest report claims that Lacazette has been asking Antoine Griezmann for information about Atletico Madrid.
 Although Griezmann has left the Spanish side, he enjoyed a stellar spell with them and he remains in contact with most of his former teammates.
 It is unclear what he has been telling the Arsenal striker, however, for Lacazette to be asking for information about another team, it seems that he is preparing to leave Arteta’s side.
 Arteta faces a tough summer as he looks to keep his best players and to also acquire some new quality talent.
 Lacazette isn’t the only player whose future is unclear, the club is also struggling to tie Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang down to a new deal.

Janis Claire (Rogers) Drescher
 Orondo, WA
 Janis Claire (Rogers) Drescher, 63, of Orondo, WA, passed away on April 27, 2020, at her home. She was born on June 18, 1956, to Dorothy and Maury Rogers of Cashmere, WA. She graduated from Cashmere High School in 1974. She grew up playing piano, taking ballet lessons, and singing in the church choir. Janis received her degree in Business Management from Central Washington University in 1978. She became the Sales & Catering Manager at the Thunderbird/Red Lion Hotel in Wenatchee, WA.
 On July 18, 1981, Janis married Brett Drescher at Cashmere United Methodist Church, her childhood church. They lived on the orchards of Auvil Fruit Company in Orondo, where they raised their daughters: Kathryn “Kacey” Roberts and Allison Drescher. Janis and Brett owned and operated D&D Orchards, LLC, for which Janis meticulously kept the books. She was her daughters’ biggest cheerleader, and was involved in their many activities, including school, dance, softball, and theater. Janis was the first to have her camera ready for a “photo-op,” which paired well with her part-time job at Parsons Photography, as a Photographer’s Assistant. She was a lifelong fan of high school athletics in the valley and enjoyed supporting community theater. Janis was also a passionate sports fan and a proud Coug and Zag mom.
 Janis is survived by her husband, Brett Drescher of Orondo, WA; mother, Dorothy Rogers of Cashmere, WA; brother, Tom Rogers, and wife, Kate of Wenatchee, WA; daughter, Kacey Roberts, and husband, Zach of Lompoc, CA; and daughter, Allison Drescher and fiancé, Isaac Cooper of East Wenatchee, WA. She was preceded in death by her father, Maury Rogers; and brother, James Rogers.
 A Memorial Service celebrating the life of Janis Drescher will be held at a later date due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Memorial contributions may be made to Central Washington University or Music Theater of Wenatchee. Arrangements by Jones & Jones/Betts Funeral Home, Wenatchee, WA.

Sheltering in place may sound like a more pleasant experience when your home is on wheels, especially with gasoline prices at rock bottom. But with a patchwork of travel restrictions in place, national and most state campgrounds closed indefinitely, not to mention locals feeling less than welcoming of out-of-towners for fear of contagion, RV drivers are increasingly trapped in the vehicles meant to liberate them.
 “Most RVs are not set up to be disconnected from utilities for extended periods of time, so as a result, when a shelter-in-place order is issued, it creates a nationwide game of musical chairs for people trying to find a spot to hunker down in,” said Shawn Loring, chief executive of the Escapees RV Club, one of the country’s oldest and largest groups for RVers.

Still, they share grocery shopping and occasionally use the house for other amenities. Recently, they all hunkered down in the house during a tornado warning. “After all,” Robert Meinhofer said, “we are family.”
 For other RV families, enduring the crisis has remained a communal activity. Lauren and Aaron Grijalva, who traded their home in Atlanta for a 42-foot Coachman “fifth wheel” trailer 18 months ago, were parked at a campsite in Hardee County, Florida, preparing to join a crew of mobile friends in the Florida Keys when the state shut down its southern archipelago in March. They stayed in the park with their two children and two other families and awaited their friends’ return.
 The reunited group, totaling five families, is now set up in an isolated spot along a river, creating a self-contained community away from other campers. Together they number 21 adults and children, including Michelle and Justin Russell, who have two children in a 35-foot motor home.
 Michelle Russell said they have made rules about congregating in small groups. Designated people make trips to the grocery store or a local egg farm so that most of the group stays put. “We’re used to having a big campfire and our kids in and out of each other’s rigs, and we love that,” she said. “But it’s just a different time right now. We feel safe, and we know that each one of us is respecting the other’s space, and we’re all on the same page.”
 Grijalva, 39, and her husband, who blog as the Wanderpreneurs, have an aggregate following of 42,000 on their social media platforms. “We are concerned how it will go over that we didn’t distance ourselves from our neighbors during this time,” she said. “Everyone knows that we ‘river people’ are hanging out together, and it’s even raised some eyebrows in the campground. Some people don’t like it and have said we should be kicked out.”
 The manager at their park did not respond to calls seeking comment, but other camping veterans acknowledged that groups are continuing to convene. Loring, whose club owns eight RV parks in seven states, has tried to find a balance between campers’ needs and pandemic protocol.

Rebalancing is designed to get your asset allocation back to its target after it's been thrown out of whack by the stock downturn. So if your target asset allocation is 60 per cent stocks and 40 per cent investment grade bonds, and stocks have declined by 20 per cent while your investment grade bonds are unchanged in value, the resulting asset allocation for now would be 55 per cent stocks and 45 per cent bonds. To rebalance, you would sell bonds and buy stocks until the asset allocation again reached 60 per cent stocks/40 per cent bonds.

BERLIN (AP) — Hertha Berlin player Salomon Kalou is being criticized for broadcasting a livestream showing social distancing measures being flouted.
 The Ivory Coast striker took his phone with him on Monday as he fist-bumped teammates in greeting, clapped hands with fellow forward Vedad Ibisevic, complained about a pay cut, and burst in on a teammate apparently being tested for the new coronavirus.
 The footage, which has since been deleted, was broadcast on the same day the German soccer league (DFL) reported 10 positive cases of COVID-19 among the country’s 36 clubs in the top two divisions, and it appeared to contradict the league’s assertion that everything was being done to prevent the spread of the virus.
 It showed Hertha’s Jordan Torunarigha being tested by a physiotherapist who was wearing only a simple face mask as protection. The physiotherapist, David de Mel, repeatedly asked Kalou to “delete” the video, before the player walked away laughing, saying he was “only joking.”
 The DFL sharply criticized the footage on Twitter.
 “The pictures from Salomon Kalou from the changing room of Hertha BSC are completely unacceptable. There cannot be any tolerance for it – also with regard to the players and clubs who are adhering to the guidelines, because they have grasped the seriousness of the situation,” the DFL said.
 Kicker magazine said the video would damage efforts to restart the Bundesliga as it was “grist to the mill for critics who want to see professional soccer remain on hold.”

A general rule of thumb with meteor showers: You are never watching the Earth cross into remnants from a comet’s most recent orbit. Instead, the burning bits come from the previous passes. For example, during the Perseid meteor shower you are seeing meteors ejected from when its parent comet, Comet Swift- Tuttle, visited in 1862 or earlier, not from its most recent pass in 1992.
 That’s because it takes time for debris from a comet’s orbit to drift into a position where it intersects with Earth’s orbit, according to Bill Cooke, an astronomer with NASA’s Meteoroid Environment Office.
