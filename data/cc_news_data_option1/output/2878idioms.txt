I got my hands on the cleanser thanks to my apartment building which partnered with Glossier to give residents _full-size_ samples of some of its hero products when the brand opened a store in Atlanta. The first thing I noticed about the Milky Jelly was that it lived up to its description of being "gentle yet effective." The creamy gel, which doesn't foam or tingle when you apply it, may not feel like it's doing much, but the results speak for themselves. Because the formula is made up of five skin conditioners, your skin feels soft and hydrated after washing as opposed to squeaky clean and in need of moisture ASAP. And thanks to its gentle, pH-balanced, non-comedogenic properties it also doesn't irritate skin.

Arnesen has since devoted herself to protecting those fishermen from that big bad world. She now runs her own fishing business, bringing amberjack, mullet, pompano, sheepshead and shrimp to distributors that service restaurants in New Orleans and ship up the East Coast. Most days, when not at sea, she drives between Venice, the last town before the Mississippi emptied into the gulf, and New Orleans, about 90 minutes north, buying parts for her fleet, signing paperwork and unloading thousands of pounds of fish from the back of her Chevrolet Silverado 3500 pickup. She has nevertheless found the time to become one of the most prominent national advocates for gulf fishermen. Since the BP oil spill, she has attended just about every public meeting or legislative session concerning the future of the Louisiana fishing industry, which provides about a third of all seafood caught in the continental United States.

To win a majority, the pro-democracy camp is pursuing a two-pronged strategy. First, they are hoping to pick up an additional four seats in the geographical constituencies. The primary elections were in large part intended to make sure that less popular candidates don’t split the pro-democracy vote, as has happened in past elections. One factor benefiting the pro-democracy camp is that many of their supporters are extremely mobilized in the wake of the protest movement and the national security legislation. In light of the unexpectedly high primary turnout, Benny Tai even suggested that the pro- democracy camp could win as many as 45 seats by tapping into popular anger and fear over the national security legislation, including among parts of the city’s commercial elite, which has historically supported the government but is growing increasingly alarmed.

A Long Island criminal defendant tried faking his death to avoid a jail sentence, but the phony death certificate his lawyer submitted had a glaring spelling error that made it a dead giveaway for a fraud, prosecutors said.
 Robert Berger, 25, of Huntington, N.Y., now faces additional time behind bars — up to four years — if convicted in the alleged scheme. That’s on top of pending sentences for his earlier guilty pleas to possession of a stolen Lexus and attempted grand larceny of a truck, punishment that prosecutors say he was looking to avoid.
 “It will never cease to amaze me the lengths some people will go to to avoid being held accountable on criminal charges,” Nassau County Dist. Atty. Madeline Singas said in a telephone interview Tuesday.
 Scheduled to be sentenced to a year in jail last October on the theft-related charges, Berger fled New York, while taking steps to convince his then-lawyer, prosecutors and the judge that he had killed himself — including allegedly using his fiance to pass along a bogus death certificate, prosecutors said.

My two pennies worth on Bigdish (LON:DISH)


  Due to Pauls involvement in this share I did take a look under the hood in recent weeks with some research of my own. I had considered a small punt knowing fully well that could result in a 100% loss.


  Two things dissuaded me. The RNS of last week "re-inventing" its strategy with zero revenue. On the one hand I can see the long term logic of offering the service for free and generating interest but it's more about recognising the previous business model wasn't working which makes you question management generally. The second was the involvement of Zak Mir. Now I don't want to turn this into a mud slinging match or descend it into a typical bulletin board but his involvement to me is a massive red flag having seen his calamitous history. I have no doubt that as "digital communications officer" he is the architect of all of the ramping. It may be an effective strategy and the share price has gone from 1.5p a few days ago to 2.5p now but while I wish Paul all the success with this investment I can't get involved.


  As an aside, I took a look on the LSE bulletin board yesterday for the first time in years to gauge the interest in the share. I shan't be re-visting any time soon. Apparently for every 100 branches of Pizza Hut that sign up you should be adding 1.5p to the share price. Good old Zak

  If you are a news junkie, you probably have a few news aggregators you go to to get your fix. I have a couple, two of them dedicated to Uganda news.


  They offer an interesting view of how the many people out there in the world get their news, and who are the key shapers of their view of the country. You know the old story how it is not an easy task to unseat an entrenched incumbent. In Uganda power politics, the incumbent is President Yoweri Museveni.


  In news, there are two incumbents – the _New Vision_ and The _Daily Monitor._ I counted the 100 stories on one of the aggregators a week to Monday, and 90 of them were shared nearly equally between the _New Vision_ and the _Daily Monitor._


  This tells you that, while in the noise of social media and the Internet, it might seem that those two are withering on the digital vine, they are still king. The significance of that is that if you want to be noticed “out there”, for now at least, be nice to the _New Vision_ and the _Daily Monitor_ Big Chiefs and Chiefesses.


  What were the other non _-New Vision_ and _Daily Monitor_ about, or rather what did they reveal? To list a few, one was about former South Africa Under-17 and University of Sports South Africa cricketer Mpho Selowa. The lack of opportunities in South Africa forced left-handed batsman and wicketkeeper to take up Ugandan citizenship to realise his childhood dream of playing international cricket. Didn’t know that.


  Another one spoke of how the Jane Goodall Institute and One Tree Planted (OTP) are restoring habitat for endangered chimpanzees by planting three million new trees in the Uganda part of the Albertine Rift Forests. The Albertine Rift Forecasts cover Uganda, Rwanda, Democratic Republic of Congo, and Burundi. Otherwise, what these too clever ecologists mean here is what ordinary folks like us know as Kibale National Park.

If ever we could use a balm from the ways of our messed up world, now is the time. One method I've found to escape from reality over the years is through the movies. And though trips to the cinema are on hold, our TV sets are where most current movies are finding homes.

It's a real charmer, a gentle and funny little film that would be a perfect half of a twin bill with ""The Full Monty." It's been kicking around for a couple of years, had a release in its native England in early 2019, and is finally seeing the light of day in the U.S.      Based on true events from 2009, but fictionalized left and right, it tells the unlikely story of a bunch of small-town men, most of them lobster fishermen, all close friends, in the village of Port Isaac, Cornwall, who, after a hard day out on the water, would retire to their local pub, The Golden Lion, for a few pints and a lengthy singalong of traditional sea shanties.      No, nothing all that unlikely there. That part comes in with the introduction of four city dwellers, visiting Port Isaac for a day of yachting, hearing the 10 men - known collectively as Fisherman's Friends - singing, and believing that they could be the next successful boy band or, as mentioned in a quick visual gag, buoy band.      These visitors work at a music management company in London and are always on the lookout for the next big thing. But their belief in Fisherman's Friends is a gag, one that three of the four don't let the fourth city boy in on, and coerce into getting the 10 a cappella singers to sign on.      OK, that's not quite the way the real story played out, but the film's version works just fine. The city boys think the villagers are rubes, and the villagers think the city boys are wankers. Truth is - at least the truth told in the film - they are wankers, though Danny (Daniel Mays), whose leg his pals are pulling, appears to be a decent fellow, and is only doing the job his fun- loving but uncaring boss Troy (Noel Clarke) has ordered him to do.      By the time Danny catches on, he's already convinced the initially uncooperative fisherman and group frontman Jim (James Purefoy) to take a chance with him, and has given his word that they'll be treated honorably. When his boss tells him to end the charade, he can't, because he's a man of his word.      That's about as dramatic as the film gets, and in its lengthy-feeling two-hour running time, there's a lot of filler for viewers to deal with. The tough, hearts-of-gold fishermen continually rag on good-natured Danny, but nothing develops from that. There's a two-minute segment of trouble from the Coastal Guard, but that fizzles out. Tempers flare during a trivia night at the pub, and are immediately quashed. There's a boating accident, a daring rescue and a concussion. But that's never mentioned again.      The script tosses in a love interest for Danny - Jim's divorced daughter, and single mom, Alwyn (Tuppence Middleton), and offers up back stories on Jim's sometimes negative attitude, Jim's father Jago's (David Hayman) history with the sea, and a fleeting mention of Danny once being in rehab. But it turns out to be a stream of small stories that keep starting, don't go anywhere, and are forgotten, and then there's another small story.      The only other bits of drama that do take root involve some money problems that could affect the fate of The Golden Lion AKA the heart of the village, and the plot point that reduces the number of singing fishermen from 10 to nine (With so much of the story being fictionalized, did the filmmakers really need to keep a death in there?)      But aside from those instances, the film is unrepentantly upbeat, even featuring some last-minute extremely happy storytelling to cap it off. It's not very believable, and kind of twee, but that part really did happen.      "Fisherman's Friends" will be available on digital and On Demand beginning July 24.      Ed Symkus can be reached at esymkus@rcn.com.      "Fisherman's Friends"   Written by Piers Ashworth, Meg Leonard, and Nick Moorcroft; directed by Chris Foggin   With James Purefoy, Daniel Mays, David Hayman, Tuppence Middleton   Rated PG-13

A year on, a group of young activists, many in their 20s who shot to prominence in last year’s protests, are campaigning to take control of Legco in a different way: through direct elections scheduled for September 6. Every four years, all 70 seats are up for grabs, with 36 needed for a majority. Right now, the pro-Beijing coalition has 42 seats, while the pan-democracy (a.k.a., “pro-democracy”) camp holds 24 (including one localist and one notionally unaffiliated legislator).

But then viewers start to see a change in Trip. During the regiment's ill- fated charge on Fort Wagner, a white regiment looks on. Trip catches the eye of a white soldier he had previously scuffled with. Trip looks away, and the white solider shouts, "Give 'em hell 54th!" Trip grins, and all the white soldiers cheer on the 54th. In the final sequence of the film, with the regiment hunkered down at the parapet, the white colonel decides to lead them onward and is shot down immediately. First to rise, hoisting the regimental flag, Trip shouts to his comrades, "Come on!" He, too, is shot down. "Glory" ends with the colonel's and Trip's bodies being tossed into a trench grave, side-by-side.

The Orca is headed back to the waters of New England, but this time, its mission isn't to hunt sharks. It's to help save them.
   
 A group of ocean advocates and movie buffs is turning an old lobster fishing vessel into a replica of the Orca, the boat captained by the grizzled shark hunter Quint in "Jaws." The work is taking place on Martha's Vineyard, where Steven Spielberg shot the blockbuster movie in the 1970s.
   
 The occasion doesn't call for a bigger boat so much as one with a different purpose, said Vineyard native David Bigelow, who acquired the craft and is heading up the project. When finished, he said, Orca III will be used as an educational tool to help the public understand sharks and as a research vessel for scientists.
   
 The project is dear to the heart of Bigelow, who appeared as an extra in "Jaws." His drama teacher Lee Fierro, who died in April, also played the mother of a shark attack victim in the film. Reports of shark sightings on some New England beaches in recent years moved Bigelow to take on the project.
   
 "The need to educate people about the new ecosystem we're living in, because of climate change and the seal population, is probably our only defense," Bigelow said, sighting two possible drivers of increased shark sightings. "We have basically taken on this role where the boat is going to be used for education."
   
 Bigelow said that he believes the retrofitting work can be completed by this fall and that the boat can start helping people study sharks by next spring. The boat will be called Orca III because there were actually two vessels in "Jaws" -- Orca and Orca II. Orca is seen in much of the film, and Orca II was a prop vessel.
   
 Others working on the mission to bring back the Orca have a connection to "Jaws," too. Joe Alves, production designer on the movie, is on board, as is Chris Crawford, who retrofitted a boat called Warlock into the original Orca in 1974.
   
 The conservation group Beneath The Waves has signed on to use the new Orca on expeditions. The group's board of directors includes Wendy Benchley, widow of Peter Benchley, who wrote the 1974 novel on which the movie is based.
   
 "The return of the Orca is a celebration for the fans of 'Jaws,' as well as an exciting new resource in the pursuit of a greater understanding about our oceans and the life teeming in it," she said.

We may all be screwed in the long term, but even central planners worried about the medium term. Engineers often planned in 50-year increments: The design life of most structures, whether buildings or bridges or levees, tended to be 50 years. That was why the master plan was a 50-year plan. By 2070, if Lopez’s calculations were right, and the sediment diversions worked as designed, we wouldn’t all be screwed. But a few of us would be. It was not written in any official document, but that was part of the plan, too.

Two months ago, Bowling Green’s Tom Morris had an idea of creating a Facebook page to keep Bowling Green residents informed on which businesses were using best practices, and which ones weren’t, in light of the coronavirus pandemic.


  That idea in May has evolved into “Safe Places to Patronize in Bowling Green,” a Facebook group page moderated by Morris and two other people that has grown to nearly 2,600 members.


  The group is open to anyone in the community “who are actively trying to do their part to limit the spread of Covid-19. The purpose is for members to give some positive publicity to the places that are safe to shop in” and also provides warnings of unsafe places to shop, Morris said.

“I’m just glad it has been useful,” Morris said. “The real credit goes to all the people that are contributing to it. There have been a few people that haven’t bought into the premise of the group.”


  Morris said he has received a lot of positive feedback from members of the group page, many who have shared the group with friends. He added he even had one follower who told him they don’t live in Bowling Green but joined the group so they can tell their parents where to go.


  Morris said he thinks the group’s success stems from its mission to try to remain positive, even when it points out businesses that fall short of creating a safe environment for its patrons.


  “We try to have a positive tone,” Morris said. “We’ve had to establish some ground rules recently because there are so many people coming on and some of them don’t understand the rules of the road so to speak. We try to give people freedom to post, but not go crazy.”


  Morris has had to ban a few people, but for the most part people have been respectful of the rules.


  As the group continues to grow, Morris said it will remain active to help keep people informed on safe places to patronize.


  “As long as there is a need for it I hope we can continue and keep it under control and keep giving people that go there information that is helpful to them,” Morris said.
