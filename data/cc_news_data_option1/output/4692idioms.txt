Who will be the first to get Covid-19 vaccines?


  No decision has been made, but the consensus among many experts in the US and globally is that health care workers should be first, said Sema Sgaier of the Surgo Foundation, a nonprofit group working on vaccine allocation issues.

  An expert panel advising the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is also considering giving high priority to workers in essential industries, people with certain medical conditions and people age 65 and older.


  Once a vaccine gets a green light from the Food and Drug Administration, the panel will look at clinical trial data on side effects and how people of various ages, ethnicities and health statuses responded. That will determine the panel's recommendations to the CDC on how to prioritize shots.


   


   


  State officials are expected to follow the CDC's guidance as they distribute the first vaccines.


  Vaccine supplies will be limited at first. There won't be enough to protect everyone, yet getting the shots to the right people could change the course of the pandemic.


  Many other questions about distribution remain unanswered, Sgaier noted, such as whether to distribute shots equally across the country, or to focus on areas that are hot spots.

The broad answer to that is that we can say and do things that hurt people that we love all the time. We do it without meaning to and that just comes from, again, having a different prism through which we see the world or operate, whether it's your significant other or friend. So in that moment, Mark is operating from his world view. He's just like, "Hey, what did you do?" He probably didn't think twice about it. Of course, that is a very weighted thing for Lola to then process, especially coming from her friend. That bore real weight and real significance. For me personally, I can see how that can easily spiral. Even for me and Simone as actors, I can totally see parallels that could exist in the real world where she and I could disagree about something, and our perspectives being what they are just don't offer us the insight into the other person's vantage point. So yeah, that feels very real and very personal for sure.

The idea that devices cause damage to our eyes often centres on their “blue light”. In fact, tech tends to emit less blue light than the sun – and there is no evidence to suggest it is harmful.

"These are often short-term solutions, particularly for those ... who haven't necessarily chosen to work in the gig economy," said Brail. "In a way, it's chosen them, because it's the last possible option."


  She pointed to women in the workforce who have shouldered the brunt of the economic fallout of the pandemic, particularly mothers who have been tasked with taking on extra caregiving duties.


  Statistics Canada reported last month that employment among mothers with school-aged children had nearly returned to pre-shutdown levels. But the agency said the number of mothers working less than half their usual hours in September was still 70 per cent higher than before the pandemic in February.


  Brail noted that many popular side hustles, such as mask-sewing and cooking, capitalize on what is traditionally treated as women's unpaid domestic labour.


  As Azure Johnson stitches together a sewing business from scratch, the mother of four has been thinking about what she's lost and what she's gained since March.


  Johnson, who is Plains Cree from the Samson Cree Nation in Maskwacis, Alta., said her identity was wrapped up in her work helping vulnerable people build life skills at an Edmonton non-profit.


  But when the shutdown left her without childcare, Johnson made the difficult call to take a leave of absence so she could look after her boys.


  "I didn't know how my bills were going to get paid, or the next time I could go get groceries," she said. "All I knew is that we were home, and we needed to be safe, and we needed to have a backup plan."


  Then, Johnson ran into a problem that would lead her toward a financial solution.


  Her right ear isn't fully developed as a result of a congenital condition, so she can't wear traditional masks. Instead, Johnson pulled out her sewing machine to create masks that tie at the back of the neck.


  At first, she sold the masks to family and friends, then word got around she was making face coverings for people who needed different styles and sizes.


  Customers started placing so many bulk orders that her sewing machine couldn't keep up, Johnson said, so she found a distributor. By late October, she estimates she'd sold a total of about 8,000 masks.


  But Johnson didn't stop there. She'd always had a flair for putting an "Indigenous twist" on familiar items. And her sons, who had dutifully helped her sew, trim and sweep, had some ideas of their own.


  Azure and Co. has grown into a family business offering products ranging from teddy bears clad in traditional prints to T-shirts encouraging Indigenous men to take pride in their braids.


  When she left her job, Johnson felt like she lost her "position in the community." But she's since found other ways to give back, including volunteering and making specialized masks for First Nations schools.


  It's not the same as what she had, but it is her own, and Johnson is looking forward to seeing where Azure and Co. can take her.


  "I've come to a point where I think it just may be a choice for me to actually not return to work nine-to-five," she said. "I'll just do my own thing and help in my own lane."

I've been a lifelong sports nut -- both playing and watching.


   


  But sadly, my playing days are over and my watching has been tempered by politics.


   


  I'm also a lifelong Detroit Tiger fan but -- minus future Hall of Famer Miguel Cabrera -- I probably couldn't name three other players.


   


  I did note that the ball club recently named A.J. Hinch, former manager of the disgraced Houston Astros, as their new manager just days after his Major League Baseball suspension for cheating was lifted.


   


  While I'm thrilled to have a manager of his skills and experience (and believe anyone deserves a second chance), I worry about the cheating stigmatism that will undoubtedly blemish him and the Tigers.


   


  However, taking a needed break from politics, today I'd like to talk about another former MLB manager that also happened to be a very special player in his day. This player could very well be considered the greatest player of all time, certainly the greatest hitter.


   


  I'm talking about former Cincinnati Reds baseball great Pete Rose, who played from 1963-1986 and managed the Reds from 1984-89.


   


  Nicknamed "Charlie Hustle," Rose was a complete player who earned the name by racing on and off the field (as if he couldn't wait to get to his position or to the plate to hit). He was also known for fearless, head-first dives into the bases or crashing full-speed into opposing catchers during close plays at home plate.


   


  When he didn't get "good wood" on the ball and it dribbled to the second baseman for an easy out, he didn't do what many current-day gazillionaires do in that situation by jogging to first base.


   


  He ran full speed.


   


  A regular third-baseman adept at playing infield or outfield, Rose was also a switch-hitter and is the all-time MLB leader in hits (4,256), games played (3,562), at-bats (14,053) and singles (3,215).


   


  He won three World Series rings, three batting titles, one MVP Award, two Gold Glove Awards, made 17 All-Star appearances and was named Rookie of the Year.


   


  Sadly, Rose had a vice that caused him great grief the rest of his life: he was a gambler who foolishly bet on his own games during his managerial career.


   


  Rose exacerbated his problem by denying for years he had done this before finally admitting the truth. MLB, citing his ability as manager "to control games," banned him for life, and subsequently MLB's Hall of Fame.


   


  Alternatively, Hinch (and Joey Cora, new Boston Red Sox manager) devised a cheating plan to steal catcher's signals to pitchers by using powerful centerfield cameras. Operators then signaled hitters as to what the next pitch would be, making it much easier to hit and ultimately win the big prize, the World Series, which they did in 2019.


   


  Hinch and Cora's slap-on-the-wrist, err, penalty? Banned from baseball one year.


   


  So, if the offense is the manager's ability to control games, how could anyone not see similarity in all three cheaters as well as the obvious disparity in their penalties?


   


  While I certainly don't condone his offenses, based on Hinch and Cora's penalties for virtually doing the same, Pete Rose deserves to be removed from MLB's "Permanently Ineligible" list and ultimately inducted into MLB's Hall of Fame ASAP.


   


  I would add, especially before he leaves this earth.


   


  But what do I know?

 # Brockton man, 18, indicted on attempted murder charge in city shooting of 17-year-old
 Cody Shepard
 The Enterprise
 BROCKTON — An 18-year-old Brockton man accused of shooting a teenager in the city has been indicted.
 A Plymouth County grand jury returned indictments charging Walter Gray Jr., 18, with armed assault with intent to murder, assault and battery with a dangerous weapon, carrying a firearm without a license, carrying a loaded firearm without a license, two counts of possession of ammunition without a firearms license and discharging a firearm within 500 feet of a building.
 The indictment stems from Gray's arrest on April 2 in connection with a March shooting in the city.
 On March 20, police responded to a call reporting a shooting in the area of 20 Johnson Court.
 On scene, police located a 17-year-old male victim suffering from a gunshot wound. The victim, who suffered a “significant injury,” according to police, was taken by Brewster Ambulance to Good Samaritan Medical Center in Brockton. He was later transferred to a Boston hospital and survived his injuries.
 Through an investigation, police say they identified the suspect in the shooting as Gray.
 On April 2, Brockton police's Special Reaction Team, a tactical group similar to a SWAT unit, executed a search warrant at a second-floor apartment at 123 Lawrence St.
 Gray was located at the home and arrested.
 “Although no firearm was located, .40-caliber ammunition and clothing was seized from the address,” Brockton police Detective Lt. Paul Bonanca said at the time.
 Gray was arraigned in Brockton District Court, where he pleaded not guilty to several charges. The case was still pending prior to the indictment.
 The recent indictment moves the case from Brockton District Court to Plymouth County Superior Court in Brockton, where more serious crimes are prosecuted and penalties are more severe if defendants are convicted.
 Gray is scheduled to be arraigned Nov. 25 in Brockton Superior Court.

LAMBOLEY, Gilbert Eugene 97, passed away November 13, 2020 in Clearwater, FL. A native of Paris, France, he was born November 12, 1923 and moved to the United States with his parents in 1935. He attended the Ringling School of Art in 1938 and served for a short time in the United States Navy and received an honorable discharge due to medical reasons. Shortly afterwards he entered the civil service during the war, graduating from the Anderson Airplane School of Nashville in 1942 and coming to Tampa, Florida to work at Drew Army Air Field, now Tampa International Airport. After the war, he decided to permanently settle in Tampa and became an architectural draftsman and renderer. His first job was with the Italian architect Ivo DeMinicis, working with him until his death in 1960 and then with Cesar P. Alfonso in 1964. He retired from drafting in 1986. Many of the churches built for the Diocese of St. Petersburg in the Tampa Bay area show his handiwork; his crowning achievements were Blessed Sacrament in Seminole, Florida and the Nativity Catholic Church in Brandon, Florida. He married Geraldine Schneider in February 1946 and together had four children, Diane, Geraldine, Louis, and Lyle. They were married for thirty-six years until her death in November 1982. Gilbert was an avid fisherman and caught many largemouth bass in the area. One fish caught in Lake Tarpon got him a photo in the newspaper in 1948. Another love was bicycling; he began riding his bicycle to work in 1969 and continued to ride until long after retirement, often putting in rides of over eighteen to twenty miles well into his eighties. He was a philosopher, an artist, a musician, and a Renaissance man by any definition, always tinkering and creating things on paper even up until his final illness. He gave selflessly of himself in every way to everyone. He was preceded in death by his parents, Louis Eugene and Therese Studer Lamboley; his wife, Geraldine Schneider Lamboley and his daughter, Diane Isabelle Gonzalez. He is survived by his daughter, Geraldine Eileen Walther (Thomas) of Longmont, Colorado, Louis Gilbert Lamboley of Tampa, Florida, Lyle Harry Lamboley (Virginia Ruth) of Clearwater, Florida, and numerous nieces, grandchildren, great-grandchildren, and great-great- grandchildren. Thanks go out to Traci and Suncoast Hospice/Empath Health for their selfless service in keeping him comfortable. Abbey Affordable Cremation and Funeral Services is in charge of final disposition.

Just as has been the case since season 1, oftentimes Lola, who she is and her style as a judge, gets herself into a position where she's having to do damage control. This is no different. In this case, there's a particular spin on it or a misrepresentation of what she said. But I think it's important to see those moments where Lola is not always dealing edicts from on high, but you see Lola back on her heels a bit in defensive mode, and you see the way that the politics of justice behind the scenes can work to where judges are certainly not impervious to the larger political moods of a time. I think all that's really cool and the way that it's dealt with over the course of these first two episodes is pretty cool.

Yeah. Honestly, this is something that I have really been advocating for their relationship is more tension that is derived from their different viewpoints and their different experiences in the world. You have this relationship where on the one hand, the foundation is very much a mutual respect, a mutual care or love and intelligence, an ability to bounce ideas off each other and take care of one another in all these different ways. And on the other hand, it's a relationship between a Black woman and a white man who had very different experiences in the world, partly because of who they are. My inclination is to say, "Look, we should explore that. We should explore how who they are sometimes means that they run up against their own blind spots and they hurt each other." To me, that feels very real to a relationship like this.      I think starting out the season like this and really putting that [out there], especially in the context of where our country has been over the last seven months, it seems totally right and appropriate that this would be a moment where their divergent sets of experiences and viewpoints would come to a head over something like this. I love that. I also think that it then offers an opportunity to say, "OK, how do you then address these things, address these differences and hurts? And can you while still maintaining the underlying relationship with love?" Because I don't think it's going to be too much of a spoiler alert to say, yeah, they're going to figure it out, but it's not without going through it a bit first. That's the kind of relationship I think we should all aspire to is a relationship that can endure difficulty, that pushes us to see things in new ways and probably hurts a bit, but that we get through because there's enough of a real love that underlies it.

I think we all collectively -- because it takes about 200 people to make one of these things -- felt a sense of relief that we were going back to work because we didn't work for a very long time. I think there was a sense of relief. At the same time, there was a sense of relief that we didn't lose anybody. There were people in the crew and certainly people on the cast who lost friends or family members. But we didn't lose anyone who's part of our [production]. And so, to me, the ending was sort of an acknowledgement of reaching outside the television show or the computer or however you watch the show and saying, "God, we're so happy that we're able to do this for you. This gives us such pleasure and there was a moment when we felt we might never be able to do it again." And that was very heartfelt. I felt it was necessary for us to acknowledge that, to say that. And when I introduced it as an idea with the cast, they were totally on board. Likewise, when I called Michael and said, "Listen, I think you're going to spend a lot of this episode lip- syncing," he completely got it, you know? It's not an easy conversation to call somebody who's an amazing a singer as Christopher Jackson and say, "Listen. Good news, you have a musical number. Bad news, you're lip-syncing somebody else's song." But he was great. He said, "No, I totally get it, man." The truth is everybody had a lot of fun with that. I'm very proud of it. I'm curious to see how the world reacts to it, but that was really what the ending was about. It was a way of us saying to our audience, "We love you, we miss you. That was a close one, but we're still here."

LAMBOLEY, Gilbert Eugene 97, passed away November 13, 2020 in Clearwater, FL. A native of Paris, France, he was born November 12, 1923 and moved to the United States with his parents in 1935. He attended the Ringling School of Art in 1938 and served for a short time in the United States Navy and received an honorable discharge due to medical reasons. Shortly afterwards he entered the civil service during the war, graduating from the Anderson Airplane School of Nashville in 1942 and coming to Tampa, Florida to work at Drew Army Air Field, now Tampa International Airport. After the war, he decided to permanently settle in Tampa and became an architectural draftsman and renderer. His first job was with the Italian architect Ivo DeMinicis, working with him until his death in 1960 and then with Cesar P. Alfonso in 1964. He retired from drafting in 1986. Many of the churches built for the Diocese of St. Petersburg in the Tampa Bay area show his handiwork; his crowning achievements were Blessed Sacrament in Seminole, Florida and the Nativity Catholic Church in Brandon, Florida. He married Geraldine Schneider in February 1946 and together had four children, Diane, Geraldine, Louis, and Lyle. They were married for thirty-six years until her death in November 1982. Gilbert was an avid fisherman and caught many largemouth bass in the area. One fish caught in Lake Tarpon got him a photo in the newspaper in 1948. Another love was bicycling; he began riding his bicycle to work in 1969 and continued to ride until long after retirement, often putting in rides of over eighteen to twenty miles well into his eighties. He was a philosopher, an artist, a musician, and a Renaissance man by any definition, always tinkering and creating things on paper even up until his final illness. He gave selflessly of himself in every way to everyone. He was preceded in death by his parents, Louis Eugene and Therese Studer Lamboley; his wife, Geraldine Schneider Lamboley and his daughter, Diane Isabelle Gonzalez. He is survived by his daughter, Geraldine Eileen Walther (Thomas) of Longmont, Colorado, Louis Gilbert Lamboley of Tampa, Florida, Lyle Harry Lamboley (Virginia Ruth) of Clearwater, Florida, and numerous nieces, grandchildren, great-grandchildren, and great-great-grandchildren. Thanks go out to Traci and Suncoast Hospice/Empath Health for their selfless service in keeping him comfortable. Abbey Affordable Cremation and Funeral Services is in charge of final disposition.

President Trump is expected to cut a significant number of U.S. troops in Afghanistan and a smaller number in Iraq by the final days of his presidency, U.S. officials say.


  The plan would run counter to military commanders’ advice over the past year, while still falling short of Trump’s much-touted goal to end America’s long wars.


  The decision comes just days after Trump installed a new slate of loyalists in top Pentagon positions who share his frustration with the continued troop presence in the war zones. The expected drawdown would still leave 2,500 troops in both Iraq and Afghanistan, meaning that President-elect Joe Biden would be the fourth president to grapple with the still-smoldering conflicts launched in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks.


  U.S. officials said Monday that military leaders were told over the weekend about the planned withdrawals and that an executive order is in the works but has not yet been delivered to commanders. Officials cautioned that there could always be changes, and Trump is known to make snap decisions based on media reports and online chatter. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.
