But it is the design of the station which, if you only have time to pause and admire it, can take the breath away. The whole station is built on a gentle curve.

South Dakota’s tourism industry has grown for the 10th straight year, reaching a record level of visitors, visitor spending and impact on the state’s economy.
 “(Tourism in South Dakota) also has a much larger impact beyond visitor- spending dollars,” said Governor Kristi Noem. “These visitors fall in love with our state, and many of them decide to move here, start a business here, or retire in our great state.”
 “Even with massive flooding and the adverse weather we faced in our state and the region, 2019 was a better year than we thought it was going to be,” said James Hagen, secretary of the Department of Tourism. “The spring snowstorms, flooding, and a struggling agriculture economy did result in fewer visitors to our national and state parks, lower hotel occupancy in the Black Hills, and less revenue in certain communities. However, that was balanced by the growth of other areas and businesses across the state.”

President Mnangagwa sees churches playing a pivotal role in helping create a "peaceful, prosperous, corruption-free united nation".      Speaking at the closing ceremony of the 49th International Pastors Deeper Life Leadership Conference at the Zimbabwe Assemblies of God Forward in Faith Ministries' Africa Multinational for Christ College in Harare yesterday, President Mnangagwa, who is enjoying his leave, stressed the positive role churches could play in building a better social fabric that unites people.      As early as 8am, gaiety was written all over the AMCC Centre as thousands of ZAOGA Forward in Faith pilgrims from across the globe joined in song and dance praising God and celebrating the successful end of a week-long leadership training conference.      While some were celebrating the end of the conference, some were showcasing their business acumen through selling wares to local and international dignitaries at an exhibition.      The workshop was attended by pastors from 150 countries.      ZAOGA commands a large following the world-over.      President Mnangagwa, who was invited by the church leader Archbishop Professor Ezekiel Guti, gave a sermon stressing the positive contribution churches could make to society.      The church went wild as the President started preaching while quoting scriptures.      Quoting Matthew 5 verse 9, the President said: "Let us be peacemakers. I expect all churches to be identified as transformers of people's lives, builders of dreams, places and bridges of hope.      "The voice of the church must continue to inspire, motivate, guide and to harness, men, women and the youth as we gird and strengthen ourselves to grow our economy, to rid ourselves of corruption and end poverty.      "We must uphold a culture of hard work, determined to plant and reap what we would have sown. For the scriptures say we shall eat the labour of our sweat."      He praised the church for partnering the Government in empowering citizens and responding to national needs.      This comes after some churches last year contributed towards helping victims of Cyclone Idai that hit parts of Manicaland, Masvingo and Mashonaland East provinces.

The sports world was shocked to its core on Sunday when the news broke about the passing of NBA legend Kobe Bryant and his daughter Gianna after a helicopter crash in Southern California.
 That shock was felt in South Dakota. Stanley County girls basketball coach Adam Dannenbring told the Capital Journal that he was floored when he heard the news.
 “It’s really startling to me because Kobe’s a year or two younger than I am,” Dannenbring said. “As a player, I was always impressed with how hard he worked. He worked tirelessly, and was such a special athlete. His work ethic and his drive was what really got me.”
 Mike Miller, retired NBA star from Mitchell, played with Bryant on Team USA during the 2007 FIBA Americas Championship (Federation International Basketball Association). On Sunday, Miller tweeted: “Don’t know where to begin. Thoughts and prayers to the Bryant family.”
 Miller played for several NBA teams from 200-2017, winning two championships with Miami and was rookie of the year in 2001. He’s an assistant coach at the University of Memphis.
 Bryant was 41 at the time of his death. His daughter, nicknamed Gigi, was 13, and was a budding basketball star in the California area. At the time of their death, the Bryants were on their way to a travel basketball game, sources told ESPN’s Adrian Wojnarowski. All nine people on board the helicopter were killed, according to the Los Angeles County’s Sheriff Department.
 Bryant’s list of accolades is vast. He was a five-time NBA champion, 18-time All-Star, NBA MVP in 2008, and fourth on the NBA’s All-Time Scoring List, having just been passed up by LeBron James on Saturday. Bryant also won an Oscar in 2018 for his animated short film Dear Basketball. He was the host of the ESPN+ web series Detail with Kobe Bryant. Bryant is survived by his wife Vanessa, who he married in 2001, and daughters Natalia (17), Bianka (3), and Kapri (seven months).

So, it's obvious to everybody in the world that the brutish and arrogant attitude of those slaughtering fellow Nigerians all over the place, in Kogi, in Benue, even in Katsina and Zamfara would have been put in check by a serious non partisan government.

Avastin is a prescription-only medicine that is a solution for intravenous infusion. It is a biologic antibody designed to specifically bind to a protein called VEGF that plays an important role throughout the lifecycle of the tumor to develop and maintain blood vessels, a process known as angiogenesis. Avastin is designed to interfere with the tumor blood supply by directly binding to the VEGF protein to prevent interactions with receptors on blood vessel cells. The tumor blood supply is thought to be critical to a tumor's ability to grow and spread in the body (metastasize).

Men's hockey
 Nor'Easters sweep Seahawks
 The University of New England, ranked No. 9 nationally, powered its way to a pair of 9-0 victories over reeling Salve Regina over the weekend.
 The Nor'Easters scored 11 power-play goals in the two-game series as Salve Regina's losing streak reached four. The Seahawks, who have lost five of their past six games, were ranked 12th nationally at the beginning of last week but most likely will be bounced from the top-15 when the new poll is released.
 Salve Regina's overall record slid to 10-6-1 while its Commonwealth Coast Conference mark went to 6-3-1 as the Seahawks dropped to fourth place. The Nor'Easters are in first (9-1) in the conference and 13-3-1 overall.
 The bad news started Friday, when the Nor' Easters blew open a close game by scoring seven goals -- including five consecutive power-play goals in a six- minute span -- in third period to send the hometown fans home happy with a 9-0 win in Biddeford, Maine.
 The Seahawks were whistled for six infractions in the final period, including a five-minute major penalty, and UNE took full advantage as it outshot the Seahawks 19-2 in the stanza. Salve goalie Tony Rehm made 38 saves.
 The Seahawks lost their composure again at Portsmouth Abbey School on Saturday as they were whistled for 52 minutes in penalties on 15 infractions compared to four penalties for eight minutes for UNE. The Seahawks had 34 penalty minutes in the last period, including two five-minute majors and two 10-minute game misconducts.
 Louis-Felix St. Jean and Rehm combined to make 38 saves as the Seahawks were outshot 47-14 in the game.
 Women's hockey
 Salve drops two
 Lexi Anderson scored a shorthanded goal in the second period, but it was the lone tally Salve Regina could muster as it bowed to Endicott 3-1 on Saturday in Beverly, Massachusetts.
 It was the fourth straight loss for the Seahawks, who dipped to 1-9 in the Colonial Hockey Conference and to 4-14 overall. Madison Jalbert made 42 saves to keep the Seahawks in the game against the unbeaten conference leaders.
 The previous night, the Seahawks pulled to within a goal at 3-2 in the third period before Endicott exploded for three goals in a 96-second span and downed Salve Regina 6-2 at St. George's School.
 Emma Gotthelf and Cassidy Lariviere each scored a goal for Salve Regina. Brynn Mendes had two assists, Amanda Fantasia and Michaela Carrera had an assist each and goalie Jalbert made 40 saves.
 Men's basketball
 University of New England 77, Salve Regina 70
 The University of New England rallied from a three-point halftime deficit and went ahead for good with six minutes left in the game, downing Salve Regina 77-70 in Commonwealth Coast Conference game on Saturday in Newport.
 The Nor'Easters outscored the Seahawks 39-15 from beyond the arc in a game that featured nine ties and 15 lead changes. The outcome left both teams with a 4-5 conference record and tied for fifth place.
 Mikey Spencer scored 17 points and had a team-best seven rebounds to pace the Seahawks. Chris Peasley came off the bench to score 13 points and grab five rebounds in13 minutes, while Cameron Collins and Kevin Kelly combined to score 24 points and snag a dozen rebounds.
 Women's basketball
 University of New England 60, Salve Regina 47
 The University of New England closed the second quarter with a 16-2 run and never looked back en route to a 60-47 win over Salve Regina on Saturday in Newport.
 The Commonwealth Coast Conference leaders (8-1) outscored the Seahawks 23-11 in the second quarter to build a 38-20 halftime lead. Torie Scorpio and Mary Rorke each scored 13 points on a combined 9-for-30 shooting night as the Seahawks made 28.8 percent of their field-goal tries.
 It was the fourth loss in the past five conference games for Salve Regina, which slipped to 2-7 and to 2-16 overall.

"We made this album in a bedroom in the house we grew up in, and it was mastered in someone's living room," Eilish said. "Anything is possible."
 Eilish seemed genuinely caught off guard by her victories, suggesting that Ariana Grande deserved the prize for album of the year. She offered no speech for record of the year beyond a thank you.
 The Grammys audience has declined over the years, but the awards can still deliver a sales bump to winning artists. It's also a valuable showcase for the stars who perform during the telecast. The songs featured on last year's Grammys saw a 480 percent increase in digital-download sales, according to Billboard.
 The music business's transition from physical albums to digital distribution was painful -- industrywide revenue is still only about half what it once was -- but it means fans can reward winning artists immediately. The Grammys are more influential than other award shows in terms of instantly swinging the fortunes of artists and their work.
 Oddsmakers favored Eilish headed into the ceremony. She was given the best chance of winning three of the four general categories, as well as a couple of pop prizes.
 The Los Angeles native began writing songs at the age of 11, collaborating with her brother. She released a handful of songs between 2015 and 2018, and in 2019 put out her debut album, "When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?" The album was the year's second-biggest hit, outselling established pop stars Taylor Swift and Ariana Grande, according to Nielsen. And five of its songs ended up ranking among the year's 100 biggest tracks.
 "We wrote an album about depression and suicidal thoughts and climate change," O'Connell said. "We stand up here confused and grateful."
 Eilish's strongest competitor was expected to be Lizzo, the 31-year-old who was also up for all four of the general prizes. Lizzo's music defies conventions of genre. Though initially labeled a rapper, her songs were nominated in three different genres: R&B, pop and urban contemporary.
 Lizzo earned three prizes, and edged out Eilish for the first award of Sunday's telecast -- best pop solo performance. Her rise to the top of the music industry was slow, and then very, very fast. A classically trained flautist, Lizzo toiled in the Minneapolis independent music scene for several years before signing to Atlantic Records in 2016. Her next few singles garnered some listeners, but she remained a darling of critics more than the mainstream.
 The dominance of young artists at the Grammys reflects how social media and streaming have affected stardom. It is easier than ever for musicians to get their music released and to communicate with fans. While the sheer volume of new music makes it harder for anyone to break out, the ubiquity of Spotify, Instagram, YouTube and TikTok means that an act can go from anonymity to global stardom in less than a year.
 Lil Nas X, who won two prizes Sunday, recorded his first song just a couple years ago. Lizzo's "Truth Hurts," first released in 2017, received a huge boost from TikTok and the film "Someone Great." It was added to the deluxe version of her album and became the No. 1 song in the U.S. two years after its release.
 Lizzo also performed the first songs of the night, which she dedicated to Bryant's memory.
 The specter of Bryant hung over the show. The Los Angeles Lakers star -- killed in a helicopter crash Sunday -- played in the same arena, Staples Center, where the Grammys were held. Grammy performers featured his jersey in their staging, while hundreds of fans in Laker jerseys congregated outside the arena.
 "We are literally standing here heartbroken in the house that Kobe Bryant built," said host Alicia Keys. The 15-time Grammy winner emceed the event for the second year in a row, replacing a long line of comedian hosts.
 She drew the unenviable task of balancing a celebration of the year's best music with the sadness of Bryant's death and a recent scandal involving the Recording Academy, the body that gives out the awards.
 The Academy's chief executive officer, Deborah Dugan, was ousted in January less than a year after taking over for allegedly mistreating a subordinate. She then sued the organization and accused it of fostering corruption and sexual harassment.
 Dugan was hired, at least in part, to clean house after her predecessor, Neil Portnow, told women to "step up" if they wanted to receive more nominations and more slots to perform during the Grammys. That comment was widely criticized by artists, including Pink.
 The Grammys have been criticized for not keeping up with the times, especially in terms of recognizing women or people of color. While hip-hop has displaced rock as the defining musical genre of culture in the U.S. and abroad, no hip- hop act has won album of the year since Outkast in 2003.
 In past years, the Recording Academy handed album of the year to aging rockers (Steely Dan and U2), jazz pianists (Herbie Hancock) and country (Alison Krauss) over a new guard of artists like Eminem, Amy Winehouse, Kanye West and Lil Wayne.
 But the organization has welcomed new members, aiming to inject more diversity and youth into its voting body. Even so, it still elects nominations through an opaque press involving committees.
 Winners made little mention of the controversy in their speeches, though pop star Dua Lipa did call on industry executives to hire and work with more women. Keys touched on it indirectly, urging a shift "to realness and inclusivity."But the musician summed up the sentiments of everyone in the building with an expression of exhaustion.
 "Let me be honest with y'all -- it's been a hell of a week," Keys said.

ZIMBABWE will use mobile devices for mapping and data collection during the 2022 census enumeration process, an exercise which is expected to cost $1,4 billion.      Addressing a press conference in Harare recently, Zimbabwe National Statistics Agency director general, Mr Taguma Mahonde said the Fifth Population and Housing Census will be conducted in August 2022.      "In order to successfully plan for economic and social development and carry out administrative activity or scientific research, it is necessary to have reliable and detailed data on the size, composition, distribution and other benchmark statistics on the population.      "The census provides this much needed information. However, the census is very costly to undertake and this is why it is conducted every 10 years. Thorough and careful planning is required to ensure that the programme is implemented in an effective and efficient manner. Prior to conducting the Population and Housing Census, it is a requirement that a cartographic census mapping exercise be carried out," said Mr Mahonde.      "We are already doing the mapping exercise where we divide every ward into enumeration areas. This is done physically by people on the ground."       Treasury was funding operations of the pre-enumeration phase while the United Nations Population Fund assisted with vehicles.      The Ministry of Finance and Economic Development would soon convene a conference for development partners for them to find areas where they could come on board and assist.

The economy is going down the drain. So much money have been allegedly lost by NNPC, the obvious cash cow of the country. We are talking about trillions being lost in the last two or three years. Government has continued to borrow, almost blindly and mindlessly to the chagrin of Nigerians and also the international community. Because when you borrow humongous amounts of money and nobody is seeing what you do with the money, there is cause for worry. On several occasions, huge amounts of money are alleged to be voted for what are otherwise private enterprises. For instance, cattle rearing, ranching and so on. These are private businesses that should not be the concern of any government. Cattle rearing is like fishing, like shoe making, like tailoring, like any other private business. And for a government, any government to assume responsibility of financial commitment and sometimes, even providing military and police cover for such private businesses, it is calamitous to the peace and cordial relations within the nationalities that constitute a country. What I'm saying in essence therefore, is that the new year doesn't hold much promise for Nigeria, and if care is not taken, the centre may not be able to hold any longer because there is a limit to which any power on earth can push anybody. And all the cultures of the world agree that once an individual, or even an animal is pushed to the wall, he will fight back. Nigeria is dangerously inching towards such desperation.

The Pierre T.F. Riggs Governors boys varsity basketball team faced the Douglas Patriots at Riggs Gymnasium in Pierre on Thursday night in a battle of teams fighting to get into the Class AA Playoffs.
 The Govs, who had a new starting line-up that included seniors Justin Houlette and Josh Rowe, started the game off well with a 12-5 lead after the first quarter. That would be the highlight for the Govs, as the rest of the game belonged to the Patriots. The Patriots stormed back to take a 21-19 lead at halftime. They extended that lead to 38-34. The Patriots pulled away in the fourth quarter by outscoring the Govs 24-21 to clinch a 62-55 victory.
 The Patriots were led by sophomore guard Darrell Knight, who had 12 points. Sophomore guard Conner Sauvage and senior center Ryan Tompkins each had 11 points. Sophomore guard Kolin Ray chipped in ten points.
 The Govs were led by freshman phenom Lincoln Kienholz, who had 29 points and ten rebounds. Senior center Grey Zabel had 11 points. Junior center James Mikkonen added ten points off the bench.
 The Patriots won the game from the free throw line and on the glass. They made 19 of 25 free throw shots for a percentage of 76 percent, while the Govs made 12 of 21 shots for a percentage of 57 percent. The Patriots had a 33-28 advantage on the boards, including a 23-19 advantage in defensive rebounding.
 Govs coach Terry Becker told the Capital Journal that the game was filled with ups and downs.
 “We couldn’t get our consistency going,” Becker said. “We missed a few too many free throws and a few shots around the basket. Defensively, we just weren’t that consistent. That’s something we’re struggling with right now.”
 Becker said he was pleased with how the team performed coming out of the gate.
 “I thought our defensive intensity in that first quarter was pretty good,” Becker said. “I thought we contested their shots very well. We were executing our offense really well. When things started to falter, we started to get stagnant offensively. When you’re not scoring, your defense can start to struggle, too. At the beginning of the game, we had a little juice and a lot of energy that really gave us the lead.”
 Douglas (3-7) has defeated the Govs twice this season. The Govs (1-11) will play a pair of games this week. They will host Andrew Bergan and the Aberdeen Central Golden Eagles (5-4) at Riggs Gymnasium in Pierre on Tuesday. Tip-off is scheduled for 7 p.m. CT. The Govs will head south to Yankton for a battle with Wisconsin commit Matthew Mors and the Yankton Bucks on Saturday. Tip-off for that game is scheduled for 7 p.m. CT. Becker said that his team needs to regroup for this week’s games.
 “We’re still trying to recover from a heavy stretch of games over the last three weeks,” Becker said. “It will be important for us to rest up over the weekend so that we can come back refreshed and ready for our opponents.”

State-owned mobile network operator, NetOne's franchise programme is bearing fruit and has racked in nearly $200 million dollars since launch of the programme just over a year ago.      The franchise programme is aimed at improving the telecoms operator's distribution channels as it creates convenience and efficiency, bringing products closer to the market.      Chief executive officer Lazarus Muchenje indicated this is also one way of empowering the communities under the firm's initiatives to boost entrepreneurship within communities which has seen thousands of jobs being created across the value chains throughout the country.      In an interview, he said the franchise programme contributed $40 million in 2018, following its launch in May that same year.      In 2019, its contribution increased to $131 million as the programme gained momentum as more local businesses at community level came on board.      "Now we have over 1 500 franchise shops that have been established across the country from only 34 shops two years ago," he said in an interview.      This comes as the mobile operator is working on its turnaround which should see it grow into a world class telecoms company.      Mr Muchenje said the company had adopted a back to basics approach, which is premised on four key strategic pillars encompassing quality network, quality distribution, quality contact centre and a quality balance sheet all intended to form an efficient business.

That's just one of an ongoing, never-ending series of homer records that have been shattered this season. The Yankees homering in 30 straight games? The Mariners having a home run in every single game this year (by themselves or an opponent), extending the old record by 26 games and counting? The most homers, MLB-wide, ever hit in April, followed in May by the most home runs ever hit in any calendar month in history, followed in June by the highest home-run rate in history?
 All that has happened this season, and too many other tater accolades to list here.
 When the Mariners hit 264 home runs in 1997, it was a major league record that stood for 21 years until the Yankees broke it last season with 267. Well, this season, four teams (including the Mariners) are on pace to shatter the Yankees' record from last season, and four other teams could get there with a bit of a surge. The Twins are on a 311-homer pace, which would mark a Bob Beamonesque escalation of the record.
 And so it goes. Fourteen teams -- nearly half -- are headed toward their ballclub's single-season home run record (and that total, too, could rise). More players are on pace to hit 30 and 40 home runs than ever before And the stat that ties it all together, courtesy of The Athletic's Jayson Stark: MLB is on a pace for 6,591 homers this year, which not surprisingly would be the most in history -- more than 1,000 ahead of last year (5,585), and roughly 2,400 more than were hit just five years ago (4,186).
 There still is an intrinsic thrill in seeing a player put together the perfect swing that results in the ball being sent on a majestic arc out of the ballpark. It has always been the ultimate achievement in baseball, and one of the signature events in the entire sporting world.
 But when they happen so frequently, and so universally, by the behemoths and the scrawny, by No. 4 hitters and No. 9 hitters, the accomplishment is greatly cheapened -- and ultimately devalued. And when every baseball game is dominated, as I've talked about before, by home runs, strikeouts and walks -- none of which result in the ball being put in play -- it's a huge, growing problem.
 The last time we had such aberrational results, of course, was during the steroids era that began in the 1980s. I'm not naive enough to say categorically that no players are juicing, but with stringent testing now in place, I don't think that's the core of the problem.
 No, virtually everyone agrees what is at the root of what Ken Rosenthal has dubbed "Bludgeon Ball." It's not the focus on "launch angle," and it's not the increased velocity of pitchers that are causing the ball to go farther in the other direction. Those are ancillary factors, but not the main one.
 The culprit, quite clearly, is the baseball itself. All the proof you need is that the Class AAA minor leagues this year are using MLB baseballs for the first time, and their homer totals have increased precipitously across the board. Homers are up by a staggering 50 percent in the Pacific Coast League. In the lower minor leagues, with no change in baseballs, there is no change in home-run rate.
 Justin Verlander caused a major stir at the All-Star Game last week when he accused MLB of intentionally doctoring the baseball in order to ramp up the power. He pointed out that MLB last year purchased Rawlings -- the company that produces the balls.
 "If any other $40 billion company bought out a $400 million company and the product changed dramatically," Verlander told ESPN, "it's not a guess as to what happened. We all know what happened. (Commissioner Rob) Manfred, the first time he came in, what'd he say? He said we want more offense. All of a sudden he comes in, the balls are juiced? It's not coincidence. We're not idiots."
 Verlander was essentially called into the principal's office the next day, given a stern talking to by Manfred's MLB lieutenants, Joe Torre and Jim Leyland. And Manfred, in his annual session with the Baseball Writers' Association of America on Tuesday, vehemently denied (not for the first time), any intentionally doctoring of the ball.
 I believe it's likely nothing conspiratorial and sinister is taking place. Not like what happened in 2013 in the Japanese League when commissioner Ryozo Kato resigned after it was revealed the league had secretly switched to a livelier baseball for the 2013 season. That was the year that former Mariner Wladimir Balentien hit 60 homers to break Sadaharu Oh's 49-year-old record of 55.
 But something is going on, whether intentional or not. The consensus seems to be that because of improvements in the production process at Rawlings, the ball is more aerodynamically sound, with less drag. Specifically, the "pill" that is the core of the baseball is being centered with more precision, and that makes the ball travel farther. The seams, shown to be lower and tighter than before, are believed to be a big factor as well (and also leading to more pitchers' blisters, but that's another story).
 Not being a physicist, I'm not qualified to address all that. But being a staunch lifetime baseball fan, I do feel qualified to say that MLB needs to fix it. Whatever it takes. Whenever the sport gets so out of proportion, the statistics threaten to become meaningless -- and numbers have always been the historical foundation of baseball, the way we link generations and provide a semblance of continuity.
 If and when the ball is returned to normalcy, you might even get a welcome bonus that goes beyond a return to home-run statistics that we can wrap our brain around. Namely, drives that have been clearing the fence would now stay in the yard, thus providing the much-needed bump in balls in play.
 Right now, we have way too many balls flying out of play. Seeing a home run used to be the biggest thrill in a baseball game. Now it has become the biggest yawn.

Well, the simple answer to that is to ask, 'is there anywhere in the world where a leader has emerged that every constituent of that community were party to the election? Did all Israelis gather to elect Moses to lead them out of Egypt? If they had waited for a consensus to get out of Egypt, they still would have been there till today. Is it all of them that agreed that they should move out of all the places they are scattered all over the world to go back to Israel in 1948? It's just a handful of people led by Ben Gurion. Did all Igbo agree that Ojukwu should lead them after he had been appointed by Aguiyi Ironsi? When the Igbo were deciding whether to go to war, did they call a plebiscite? The background to the emergence of Professor Akintoye is very clear. Some Yoruba organisations, about 78 of them, felt that the way the Yoruba land was being encircled, that the values of the Yoruba had seriously eroded, and they said, we need somebody we can go to; somebody who can be a rallying point. The way Akinjide stoop up at Ibadan in late 1966 and decided that Chief Obafemi Awolowo should be our leader. They didn't consult me in Ijebu or consult my grandfather in our village before deciding to chose him. So, if 70 organisations felt threatened in their land and say yes, one Akintoye has been taking, he has been making speeches. We have been hearing about him in the US where he has been for the past 35 years. He has been encouraging the Yoruba, he has been giving us confidence and so on, and therefore, let's have him as our leader. It doesn't disturb anybody. It doesn't disturb the position of PA Fasoranti or the position of our PA Adebanjo. Of course, it's expected that there would be people who will say no we don't want him, we don't know him. But the thing is that Prof Akintoye is not just the leader of Yoruba in Ibadan or Lagos. He is the leader of the Yoruba, even in the Diaspora. The Yoruba world congress has membership in Brazil, in Cuba, in Haiti, Barbados, Benin Republic, Togo, Sierra Leone, Ghana and he is the leader of these large worldwide assemblage of Yoruba people and people of Yoruba descent. We have 76 million people in Brazil, people who have confirmed that their ancestry is Yoruba. We have more Yoruba in Brazil than we have in Nigeria. And Yoruba has been adopted as one of the national languages of Brazil. We have Yoruba academies being set up in Brazil, Cuba, all over the place, under the leadership of Professor Akintoye. And he has been doing it for years. So, I'm sure that's what they saw; these are the values they saw in the man and said, look, let him be the rallying point for us. Akintoye is a member of Afenifere. He is the chairman of their political committee. He still attends their meetings. He still goes to PA Fasoranti. PA Fasoranti was his teacher. Akintoye is not a man who arrogates anything to himself. He is a very humble man. His residence is like a Mecca. All Yoruba from everywhere troop to his residence to see him, to seek his counsel. That's what it is.

A panel of Kansas attorneys recommended a former Jackson County special prosecutor face ethics charges for allegedly misleading the jury that found a Holton man guilty of a series of sex crimes that were subsequently thrown out on appeal.
 Attorney Jacqie Spradling, now working as Bourbon County attorney in Fort Scott, has fallen once again under the disciplinary spotlight because investigators believe she misstated evidence in a district court criminal trial.
 The latest incident led to convictions in 2017 against Jacob Ewing for rape, aggravated criminal sodomy, battery and other offenses. The Kansas Court of Appeals noted Spradling's conduct when it reversed his convictions in 2019.
 The panel of lawyers reviewing the Kansas Disciplinary Administrators Office's investigation of Spradling concluded there was sufficient evidence to believe she violated the state's code of conduct in the Ewing case. A public hearing before a separate committee will follow to develop a recommendation for the Kansas Supreme Court about whether or how Spradling would be sanctioned. Potential penalties include public censure, license suspension or disbarment.
 Wendy Ewing, who filed the complaint against Spradling and is the defendant's mother, received a letter dated Wednesday from Matthew Vogelsberg, deputy disciplinary administrator, notifying her of the preliminary finding.
 "The committee has determined that probable cause exists to believe that Ms. Spradling has violated the Kansas Rules of Professional Conduct," Vogelsberg said.
 Spradling hadn't responded to a telephone-message request for comment Sunday left at the Bourbon County attorney's office.
 A judge ordered Ewing to serve maximum sentences in excess of 27 years for raping and sodomizing one woman in 2016 and another in 2014, as well as other crimes. The Court of Appeals said Spradling's misstatement of evidence in closing argument of that trial inflamed "passions and prejudices of the jury." The appeals court said "cumulative effect of the errors committed by the district court and the prosecutor denied Ewing his constitutional right to a fair trial."
 Norbert Marek, the Jackson County District Court judge who handled that Ewing case, was admonished by the Kansas Commission on Judicial Qualifications to be diligent in word choice and respectful of public perceptions after making inferences Ewing could be viewed as an "asshole."
 Spradling also remains under scrutiny by the state disciplinary administrator's office for her role in the Shawnee County murder trial of Dana Chandler. In 2012, Spradling was deputy district attorney of Shawnee County and took the lead in prosecuting Chandler for a double homicide.
 In 2018, the Supreme Court unanimously reversed Chandler's convictions by concluding Spradling's improper claims about evidence during open and closing arguments to jurors in the prosecution of Chandler illustrated how a "desire to win can eclipse the state's responsibility to safeguard the fundamental constitutional right to a fair trial."
 A state panel of attorneys later in 2018 concluded probable cause existed to believe Spradling broke ethics rules in a bid to sway the Chandler jury, but the full disciplinary hearing on that case against her hasn't occurred and is expected to take place in March. Chandler is scheduled to be retried next year on two counts of first-degree murder in the 2002 shooting death of her former husband and his girlfriend.
 Spradling was selected Bourbon County attorney in 2018 after working as assistant county attorney in Allen County. She handled cold-case homicides for the Shawnee County district attorney's office from 2009 until 2017, was with the Kansas attorney general's office from 2007 to 2009 and worked in the Johnson County DA's office from 1999 to 2007.

America’s birth rate fell to a record low in 2018, and early indicators for 2019 show a continued slide downwards. This may be a problem for a whole host of reasons. Americans reliably say they want two or three kids, despite averaging just 1.7. In the long run, a smaller generational cohort may make it hard to pay for public obligations and debts. Plus, a growing body of economic research suggests that slower population growth reduces innovation, entrepreneurship and economic dynamism, making everyone worse off.

"It feels like a dream. I don't feel like myself. I feel I'm walking on clouds," he said.
 At the morning-after press conference on Monday, Tokushoryu got choked up trying to find the right words when reporters asked him how it all happened -- how he became co-leader by Day 11 and went on to beat ozeki Takekeisho for the first title of his 11-year career.
 Tokushoryu won with a 14-1 record and delivered the first makuuchi championship for his Kise stable, despite spending 12 of the last 13 grand tournaments in the second-tier juryo division.
 He also won two of the three post-tournament prizes -- the Outstanding Performance Prize and the Fighting Spirit Prize -- for the first time in his career.
 Tokushoryu said he never imagined this day would come, not thinking of himself as the champion type or deserving of the special prizes. But he showed how a weakness can be a strength at times, especially when there is nothing to lose and everything to gain.
 "I've always said this, but there were no wrestlers below me in rank and I had my own fight to fight every single day, so I tried not to worry about anything else," he said.
 "I didn't think about what it would take for me to win the championship. (During the 15-day tournament) I couldn't even remember how many bouts I won or what day it was. I was that focused."
 Tokushoryu said he had no problem sleeping during the year's first grand tournament, and it helped that his wife lightened things up with laughter in their house, but that last night he was so excited he couldn't sleep.
 The rank-and-filer was still on cloud nine after slamming down Takakeisho in the final bout on Sunday, right before the 1.81-meter, 188-kg wrestler broke down in tears of joy.
 "I might have cried too much, but at that moment I felt relieved from all the pressure," he said.
 Tokushoryu promised to learn from his failures, having finished 4-11 the last time he joined the makuuchi ranks in May 2019 after a long stint in the juryo division.
 "I lost my appetite for victory then because I was satisfied competing in the makuuchi division, and that led to a bad record. I learned that I should never stop and should keep aiming to get better," he said.
 "After that change of heart, things have been different. Now that I've won a championship, I have to keep winning from here or I'd get laughed at. The cheers are getting louder at the basho and that's what motivates me. I want to hear that cheering again."

With more than a dozen countries now reporting cases of the virus, along with almost every region of China, the ability to rein in the pathogen's spread may be somewhat out of the hands of the Chinese government.
 All eyes will be on the World Health Organization this week, to see if it reverses the decision to hold off on classifying the Wuhan virus as a "public health emergency of international concern." Doing so could enable a more concerted international response, though many affected countries have already independently begun putting in the types of screenings and quarantines that might be recommended.
 Inside China, since January 22 when Xi intervened the government response has been colossal, but this does not seem to be having the desired effect, perhaps because of how far the virus spread before a reaction was ordered.
 Two brand new hospitals are being constructed in Wuhan itself to aid its overstretched healthcare system, due to be completed by next week, while an additional 1,200 health workers -- along with 135 People's Liberation Army medical personnel -- will soon arrive in the city.
 But the hugely advanced infrastructure that China is relying on to contain the virus and transport aid and support to where it's needed, is also what helped spread the pathogen in the first place.
 A month ago, few outside China may have heard of Wuhan, yet the city -- and a small wildlife market within it -- has managed to impact countries the world over; a sign of just how connected we all are in a globalized world. Attempting to control this inter-connectivity, as China's and other governments must do to stop the virus, may be far harder than reaping the economic benefits.
 The stringent measures placed on Hubei have also attracted criticism. Prominent Chinese human rights lawyer Zhang Xuezhong denounced them as "savage" online, earning him the opprobrium of many panicked commentators. They may also carry major downsides in the long run, Xi Chen, a public health expert at Yale University, pointed out that lockdowns not only have negative economic repercussions but also break down the "social cohesion that binds people at this special moment."
 As Xi and the rest of the Standing Committee meet this week to discuss how to tackle the virus's continued spread, they may decide on more draconian tactics. Whether their response is successful remains to be seen, as perhaps the world's most powerful state apparatus grapples with what has bedeviled many of its predecessors -- the sheer size and scale of China itself.

As a private citizen of Nigeria, and as a leader of the G9, an organisation that I belong to in Ibadan, the cheapest way of averting the calamity that is starring Nigeria in the face is for leaders, I mean, elder statesmen, to come together and discuss. I have started the move by speaking to some retired generals, some retired business men, politicians, former governors, who are above 80 years of age. I have spoken to those that I know and whose voices matter in Nigeria, and who also have seen the world. I'm talking about the likes of Emeka Anyaoku, Prof Ango Abdullahi, Brig General Rotimi in Ibadan, the likes of the newly elected Yoruba leader, Professor Banji Akintoye, and even people senior to those, our irresistible PA Ayo Adebanjo who will be 92 in April. PA Akintola is 102 , PA Fasoranti, PA Onigbogi among others. We are calling on such group of people to quickly, before the end of January, summon themselves to a table, discuss Nigeria, devoid of any partisanship. This time we are not talking about being Yoruba or Igbo, Hausa, Izon, Kalahari, Ibibio, Jukun, Kanuri, Fulani or anybody. But for the fact that there is still a place called Nigeria, even though it's not working, under that umbrella, they should come together, and very quickly and march to Aso Rock and insist on having dialogue with Buhari and his inner circle because talking with Buhari alone will not change anything. They should speak truth to power, that Nigeria doesn't belong to any individual or a group of individuals, whatever their political, military and security positions may be. And drum it once and for all, into Buhari's mind and ears that he has no legal authority to pronounce that anybody can come to Nigeria without visa. No president anywhere in the world has the authority, not Donald Trump, not Macron of France, not Vladimir Putin of Russia, to make that pronouncement that all Europeans can come to Russia and live without Visa.
