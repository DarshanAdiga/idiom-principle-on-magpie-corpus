A Democratic majority in the Senate, the party that also controls the House would give the party a firm grasp on power in Washington. Biden would have latitude over nominees, including for his Cabinet, and a chance to push major portions of his legislative agenda through Congress. If Democrats fall short, McConnell could wield the power to check Biden's ambitions.

 The roar of an angry river rushing down a mountain in the middle of the night outside your window is a sound that remains with you for some time. And if it happens every night at an altitude of 11,000 feet, the sound is, well, frozen in one's memory!
 In the summer of 1988, I was awaiting the UPSC results while posted as the officer in charge of the State Bank extension counter in Badrinath. The Bank had an unwritten policy of exiling its youngest officers to the remotest branches where banking took a backseat to surviving. Taking the posting order in my stride, I rode the bus to Badrinath via Joshimath all the way from Delhi and arrived in the temple town on a cold April morning with a single suitcase, a two in one radio, assorted cassettes and no real address to go to. Bisht, the junior clerk, was already in town and he easily spotted me amongst the hordes spilling out of the 100 odd buses that seemed to have arrived simultaneously and with the ease of a veteran, guided me through the gangs of middlemen pouncing on unsuspecting pilgrims.
 The branch was located at the foot of the steps leading up to the main temple gate. It had two rooms. One served as the office where all transactions took place and the other as my residence. My room housed a bed and a safe — the former for me and the latter for all the bank valuables. Each night I would place the account ledger and challan copies along with currency in the safe and lock it with a silent prayer. Needless to say, I felt a lot less safe in my bed with just the terrifying sound of the Alaknanda roaring past my window for company!
 One of the first problems I encountered in the abode of the gods was a very human one. The bathroom attached to the bank premise was locked out by the landlord as his demand for extra payment had not been met. So I was in this rather unenviable situation where the bathroom next to my sleeping quarters was regularly used by the landlord and his acquaintances but for my own ablutions, I had to trek a kilometre away to the GMVN Hotel where for an unofficial charge, I was allowed to use the bathroom of one of the unoccupied guestrooms. Every morning, a keen eye would have spotted the unseemly sight of a young bank manager making his way rather sheepishly if not sleepily from the steps of the temple and across the old bridge holding on to a toothbrush, toothpaste, towel, soap dish, set of fresh clothes, shaving kit and a mug. A discerning few may even have been tempted to mistake me for one of the many vendors who crowded around the early morning buses with similar wares to peddle!
 But God provided the solution in His own way. On learning that I had given the UPSC exam and was a veteran of two previous attempts, the CEO of the Temple Board, a senior PCS officer named Pant, introduced me to the head priest, a young Malayali Namboodiripad. Familiarity may breed contempt but in my case, it emboldened me to ask him if I could by any chance use the VIP bathroom and, with a little bit of help from Mr Pant, soon enough I was given access to the sanctum sanctorum. The mere fact of having sat for the UPSC exam had propelled me to some kind of celebrity status, it seems. A dip in the holy and warm community waters of the temple 'kund' each morning resolved the bathroom problem in a neat combo package which I dare say few pilgrims could aspire to!
 A favourite pastime in Badrinath was sitting on the top of the main steps and watching the pilgrims float by. They came in all shapes and sizes and from all over the country. One could identify the Bengalis from the ubiquitous monkey caps and incessant chatter, the North Indians by their mufflers and the South Indians would be the ones looking lost in a world where neither Tamil nor English was much spoken! Men, women, old, young, the fit and the invalid (the last mentioned in chairs carried on the shoulders of local porters) — all swarmed the temple and made a beeline for the morning dip in the 'kund' before lining up for the darshan. Some would eventually wander into the Bank with travellers' cheques to encash. A lady from Bombay walked in one day with a familiar problem. She had the TC but the Bombay manager had forgotten to append his signature on it without which it was not worth the paper it was printed on. Her desperate pleas were however of no avail as the Bank had trained me well to turn blind and deaf in such situations. As expected, the banker in me prevailed over any humane considerations and finally, she left tearfully clutching the invalid TC.
 The following day, I happened to see her near the bridge and she accosted me before I could take cover. She folded her hands and said, 'Thank you so much! I am so grateful and don't worry, I will send the money order as soon as I return to Bombay!' The mystery was solved late in the evening when Bisht confessed that he was so moved by her plight that he gave her Rs 2,000 which she promised to return by money order. Bisht himself always complained...",

BUFFALO, N.Y.
 Bills fans have rallied to support quarterback Josh Allen following his grandmother's death by donating more than $200,000 to a Buffalo children's hospital in her honor.
 The Oishei Children's Hospital announced the latest total on its Twitter account Tuesday, two days after coach Sean McDermott revealed the news of Patricia Allen's death following Buffalo's 44-34 win over Seattle. The donations come as the hospital celebrates its third anniversary at its downtown home.
 A number of the donations have come in at $17 each in honor of the quarterback's jersey number. Allen acknowledged the outpouring of support on Twitter, writing: "At a loss for words. Buffalo, I love you."
 Allen has been a big supporter of the hospital and has made regular trips to visit patients during his three seasons in Buffalo.
 McDermott revealed that Allen elected to play Sunday after learning of his 80-year-old grandmother's death the night before. Putting aside his grief, Allen finished 31 of 38 for 415 yards passing, matching a career high set earlier this season, and four touchdowns including one rushing to improve the AFC East-leading Bills' record to 7-2.

Pressed if there was any evidence of voter fraud, GOP Sen. John Cornyn, who just won reelection in Texas, demurred.
 “That’s really not my, my role,” Cornyn told reporters on Capitol Hill. “There is a process that is available, and I don’t begrudge the president for availing himself of that process — but in the end, they’re going to have to come up with some facts and evidence.”
 Privately, Republicans on Capitol Hill have said they are trying to give Trump the time and space he needs to come to grips with the election results.
 “Well, I think he’s got a right, a constitutional right, if there are legal challenges they want to make,” said Sen. John Thune, the No. 2 Republican. “Let those play out.”
 Republican lawmakers are hesitant to push Trump to concede to Biden, knowing it would anger their base of Trump’s most devoted supporters. But the Republican lawmakers are not overtly encouraging the president’s claims of fraud, even as they allow questions to linger.
 Only a handful of Republicans, including Sens. Susan Collins, Mitt Romney and Lisa Murkowski, have congratulated Biden on the election.

"There was a process there, but once I became 'The Drifter' in _NXT_ and I started singing songs before my matches, that's when, all of the sudden, the crowds got louder, the crowds got bigger. All of a sudden, Elias is in the main events of _NXT_ and traveling a lot more. I can remember Triple H calling me aside and saying, 'Okay, now the hard work begins.' I was there for a couple of years for sure."
 Elias' Drifter gimmick developed a cult following before exploding in popularity. It's the type of gimmick which works best in front of a live audience that reacts with every word or musical note that comes from him.
 Elias has received some polarizing reactions over the years, and he was asked what was the biggest fan reaction he ever received.
 "Seattle is absolutely up there because they booed for such a long time and so powerfully. In fact, I couldn't even do anything at one point. I remember just setting my wrist and my hand across my guitar and going, 'Okay, I'm just going to let them let it out because they are upset with me,'" recalled Elias.
 "I'm so blessed to be able to do what I do and be able to play with the crowd when we had a live crowd. There was a time in Buenos Aires where I started singing a song that was very special to this country, that I actually had no idea how special it was. The entire arena sang it with every ounce of energy they had. They sang that song at the top of their lungs with me in the middle of the crowd.
 "It had to be one or the other for sure. As a bad guy, the Seattle, and as a good guy, Buenos Aires."
 D-Von Dudley is more than just a podcast host these days, as he's also a WWE producer. He's produced several of Elias' matches over the years, and he asked Elias what his favorite D-Von-produced match is.
 "I want to say the Six-Pack Challenge on _Monday Night RAW_ with Jason Jordan, Bo Dallas, Curtis Axel, possibly Jeff Hardy, [and Matt Hardy]. I remember having so much fun in that match, and D-Von can produce any genre of matches but it seems like when multiple people start getting involved, he just got these ideas," stated Elias.
 "I just remember we did that match, we had D-Von on our side, we come back and the big guy [Vince McMahon] is very happy with it. He's very happy with me. I got D-Von to thank for his input there, so, that one kind of stands out to me."
 Elias wrestled on the indie circuit for a number of years before joining _NXT_ in 2014. He was asked about his wrestling training and who helped prepare him for WWE.
 "First off, I trained out of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. There was a school there called IWC [International Wrestling Cartel] Wrestling School and the main people that worked with me were a wrestler by the name of Shirley Doe Super Hentai and Shiima Xion was his name. He's currently in _NXT_ under Joaquin Wilde," stated Elias.
 "I was there to get started, and then actually, for a few months before I was with you, I would go down on the weekends. I wasn't booked to Louisville and I'd train with Rip Rogers."
 Earlier this year, Elias suffered a torn chest muscle that required surgery and sidelined him for five months. He just returned to action in October and was drafted to RAW after spending the last year-and-a-half on SmackDown. He talked about adjusting back to life in WWE and experiencing the Thunderdome for the first time.
 "I've been doing the in-ring performances I normally do, and it's just very interesting because I'm pretty much out there-- I'm a guy that almost exclusively works with a live crowd. In my entrance, in my opening shtick when I strum the guitar and I play off them, I react off them. So, you almost have to create your own reactions or the way you want to in the meantime. It's definitely an adjustment period, but I think there's an opportunity to have new moments occur because of this."

WASHINGTON (AP) — Republicans controlling the Senate unveiled a government-wide, $1.4 trillion spending bill on Tuesday, a mostly bipartisan measure that faces uncertain odds during this period of post-election tumult in Washington.The GOP-drafted measure contains funding for President Donald Trump’s border wall and other provisions opposed by Democrats, but top leaders in both parties want to try to mount a drive to enact the unfinished spending bills — which, along with a separate COVID-19 relief effort and annual defense policy bill, represent the bulk of Capitol Hill’s unfinished business for the year. Success depends on getting the signature of Trump, however, whose unpredictability and toxic relationships with Democrats threaten to doom the effort. The recent history of lame-duck sessions conducted as the White House is turning over has been that unfinished spending bills get kicked into the next year, with existing funding simply left on auto-pilot. “I’ve had this argument before and so far I’ve lost. I argued 12 years ago, the Obama transition, that the best thing you could do to help the new president was to get this year’s work done, and we didn’t get it done,” said Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo. “Four years ago I argued that ... and we didn’t get it done.”At issue is the roughly one-third of the federal budget that is written annually by Congress under a time-tested bipartisan process. The overall spending amount has been set in law by last year’s bipartisan budget mini-deal, so any delay into next year won’t likely result in more money for the Biden administration. Current funding expires Dec. 12.The 12 spending measures, released by Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Richard Shelby, R-Ala., have been stalled for months, trapped by fights over COVID relief and potential battles over police reform issues. But he has the backing of top panel Democrat Patrick Leahy of Vermont, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer of New York to at least pursue the effort. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., herself a long-ago veteran of the Appropriations Committee, also would like to wrap up the unfinished business.“By and large, these bills are the product of bipartisan cooperation among members of the committee,” Shelby said in a statement. “Time after time, we have demonstrated our willingness to work together and get the job done. We have before us the opportunity to deliver for the American people once again.” But Leahy carefully avoided endorsing the measure outright and instead criticized the legislation for ignoring COVID-19 relief, shortchanging safety net programs and the environment, and wasting money on unused detention beds for immigrants entering the country illegally.If the catchall bill is to advance it would have to contain COVID relief such as funding to help schools reopen, vaccinate the country, help the jobless, and boost the economy.“This country is headed for a deadly winter and it is long past time for us to provide the resources the country needs to get this virus under control and our economy back open,” Leahy said in a statement. “These bills do not provide any such relief. It is imperative that we do what is necessary to stop this pandemic from spreading.”Copyright 2020 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

If you want to start from scratch with seeds, make sure what you’re buying is high quality. The seeds should be free from harmful synthetic fertilizers and pesticides. Some veggies grow in the cold season, such as lettuce and spinach, while others grow in the warm season, such as tomatoes and peppers. Don’t plant all the seeds at the same time because the vegetables grow relatively fast and they need to be consumed right away. Use water extracted humic acid because it promotes rot development, supports enhanced nutrition uptake, not to mention healthy plant development.

Schumer said election lawsuits can be valid but they must be based in evidence and facts. He dismissed Trump’s challenges as “frivolous.”
 “Joe Biden won the election fair and square,” Schumer said.
 McConnell and Republicans said Monday they don’t want the “media” to declare the outcome of the election.
 But actually, the results in the presidential election are being determined much they way they are in all elections — including those for the House and Senate that are not being questioned — based on an analysis of vote tallies.
 McConnell touted the results Monday of the congressional races — GOP senators brushed back Democratic challengers and House Republicans expanded their ranks — even as he raised questions about the presidential contest.
 “Let’s not have any lectures, no lectures, about how the president should immediately, cheerfully accept preliminary election results,” McConnell said.

The novel felt like it had been written for me. I am dark-skinned and was called “fat, black, and ugly” nearly every day of my teenage years. Claudia MacTeer, one of the novel’s narrators, is also dark, but she has something I instantly realized I didn’t: an ability to question assessments of beauty and worth. When her peers have “a loving conversation about how cu-ute Shirley Temple was,” Claudia narrates, “I couldn’t join them in their adoration because I hated Shirley.” Likewise, other children love blue-eyed baby dolls, but Claudia relishes dismembering them. To my mind, these were unthinkable displays of strength. And this was a strength particularly valuable for African American _girls.  _

La defaite de Donald Trump expose le prince heritier saoudien, Mohammed ben Salmane, a un questionnement de l'allie americain sur l'aspect autoritaire de sa politique et l'intervention controversee de Ryad dans la guerre au Yemen, selon ces specialistes. Sous l'administration Trump, il n'a pas ete inquiete quand sa responsabilite a ete evoquee dans l'assassinat du journaliste saoudien Jamal Khashoggi, un scandale planetaire, ou encore dans la detention d'opposants au regime. Durant la campagne electorale americaine, Joe Biden a lui accuse Donald Trump, dont le gendre Jared Kushner a tisse des liens personnels avec le prince heritier, d'avoir accorde a Ryad un "cheque en blanc". Plus concretement, il a promis de demander des comptes pour l'assassinat de Khashoggi dans le consulat saoudien a Istanbul en 2018 et de cesser les ventes d'armes a l'Arabie en raison de la guerre au Yemen, ou Ryad intervient militairement a la tete d'une coalition depuis 2015. Joe Biden est meme alle jusqu'a menacer de faire de l'Arabie saoudite un Etat "paria". Pourtant, des analystes estiment peu probable une remise en cause des vieilles relations entre les deux pays en matiere de "lutte contre le terrorisme" et de stabilite du marche petrolier. Bien que les Etats-Unis aient reduit leur dependance au petrole saoudien, le royaume reste en outre un client cle pour l'industrie militaire americaine. Et les experts voient Joe Biden travailler avec Ryad sur des questions comme la lutte contre l'influence regionale de l'Iran ou la resurgence du groupe Etat islamique (EI). "Une administration Biden adoptera sans doute une ligne plus dure en matiere de droits humains, mais il est peu probable qu'elle abandonne completement le partenariat saoudo-americain", declare a l'AFP David Rundell, ancien diplomate americain qui a servi a Ryad et auteur du livre "Vision or Mirage, Saudi Arabia at the Crossroads". Politique ou rhetorique? Ryad semble se mefier de la promesse de Joe Biden de revenir a l'accord sur le nucleaire iranien de 2015, denonce unilateralement par Donald Trump en mai 2018. Le president elu chercherait a ce propos a obtenir un consensus parmi les États de la region, dont l'Arabie saoudite. "Personne ne s'attend a ce que M. Biden se rende a Ryad pour y executer une danse du sabre (comme l'avait fait M. Trump, NDLR), mais il a besoin de l'Arabie saoudite pour obtenir l'adhesion de la region a un nouvel accord avec l'Iran, a la lutte antiterroriste, a la stabilite du marche petrolier et aux relations israelo-palestiniennes", resume l'analyste saoudien Ali Shihabi. M. Biden a exprime son soutien aux accords de normalisation entre Israel et des pays arabes, y compris avec Bahrein, qui ne l'a probablement pas fait sans le feu vert de Ryad. Le prince Mohammed pourrait meme utiliser la possible normalisation avec Israel comme outil de negociation. "Beaucoup a Ryad pensent qu'un accord de normalisation avec Israel mettrait le prince Mohammed dans une bien meilleure position avec l'administration Biden", affirme a l'AFP Cinzia Bianco, analyste de l'European Council on Foreign Relations. "Tout depend de l'hostilite politique et non rhetorique de l'administration Biden a l'egard de l'Arabie saoudite", dit- elle. Des proches de detenus saoudiens placent tout de meme des espoirs en Joe Biden, a l'image de Walid Al-Hathloul, le frere de la militante Loujain Al- Hathloul, detenue depuis plus de deux ans et en greve de la faim depuis le 26 octobre. "Nous esperons que (Biden) fera des violations des droits humains en Arabie saoudite une priorite. Il est temps pour les Etats-Unis de retablir l'ordre international et de tenir (le prince Mohammed) responsable" de ses actes, a-t-il declare a l'AFP.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Despite President-elect Joe Biden’s victory, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said President Donald Trump is “100% within his rights” to question election results, as GOP lawmakers fall in line behind the White House.
 The Republican leader’s remarks on Monday, his first public comments since Biden was declared the winner of the presidential election, show how reluctant Trump’s allies on Capitol Hill have been to defy the president, even in his defeat.
 Most Republicans are refusing to congratulate Biden or declining to push Trump to accept the outcome, even though there is no evidence of widespread voter fraud.
 “Our institutions are actually built for this,” McConnell said as he opened the Senate. “We have the system in place to consider concerns and President Trump is 100% within his rights to look into allegations of irregularities and weigh his legal options.”
 McConnell said the process will play out and “reach its conclusion.”
 Republicans are closing the Trump era much the way they started it, by joining the president in shattering civic norms and sowing uncertainty in institutions, now in a way that threatens the nation’s normal transition of power.
