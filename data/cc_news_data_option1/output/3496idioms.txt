PUNTA GORDA, Belize (AP) — Hurricane Nana made landfall in Belize, pelting a relatively sparsely populated stretch of the country’s coast with heavy rain and wind before weakening to a tropical storm while pushing across Guatemala on Thursday.The U.S. National Hurricane Center reported that Nana hit land between the coastal towns of Dangriga and Placencia shortly after midnight at an area around 50 miles (80 kilometers) south of Belize City with maximum sustained winds of 75 mph (120 kph), making it barely a hurricane. The storm was moving west-southwest at 15 mph (24 kph).Later in the morning, Nana weakened to a tropical storm with maximum sustained winds near 60 mph (95 kph). It was centered about 150 miles (240 kilometers) north- northeast of Guatemala City and neared the border with Mexico.Belize authorities did not immediately report injuries when Nana when landfall shortly after midnight Thursday. More than 4,000 people, primarily in the south of the country moved to government shelters.Thousands of people stocked up on food, water and construction materials Wednesday ahead of the landfall. Long lines stretched through supermarkets and hardware store shelves were nearly bare as residents of Belize bought materials to board up windows and doors.Heavy rains were expected in Belize, as well as in northern Honduras. Forecasters said Nana would weaken rapidly as it moved inland.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

“We have lost almost half as many in the country with this pandemic as we did in World War II,” he said, adding that Wednesday was the 75th anniversary of the surrender of Japan, ending the war that took more than 405,000 U.S. soldiers’ live.


  Justice also said the 185,000 is three and half times the number killed in Vietnam and 60 times more than the number who died on 9-11, 2001.


  Anyone who says the COVID pandemic is not real or like the flu has “been wrong,” he said.


  Another record was set Wednesday as well: 2,146 active cases in the state, the most ever.


  The daily positivity rate (number of positive COVID tests as a percentage of the total number tested) has risen to 4.93 percent, he said.


  Not only that, the “RT” value, which indicates the rate of spread from one person to another, rose to 1.22, a number Justice said is the third worst in the country.


  “We are going in the wrong way,” he said.


  With the start of school coming on Sept. 8, Justice also said two school systems, in Mingo County and Mason County, have seen positive tests with school staff.


  Mason County’s positives are two teachers in a primary school and the opening of that school was postponed until Sept. 17. Five staff members tested positive in Mingo County schools.


  Clayton Burch, state superintendent of schools, praised local leaders and health officials in those two counties for handling the situation.


  “The local health department followed protocol and worked with the superintendents and administrators,” he said. “The local health department has done exactly what we asked them to do.”


  Justice also said Mercer County is on the verge of returning to the orange color code, and if that is the case Saturday night, based on a seven-day rolling average of new positive cases, no in-person instruction or sporting events will be allowed next week, the first week of school.


  Mercer County stood at 8.51 Wednesday (based on rate of cases per-100,000 population), and a 10 will move the county from yellow to orange.


  Monroe County remains in the red zone as a result of a long-term care facility outbreak there.


  If a red or orange designation is posted on the County Alert System at 9 pm. Saturday night, it will be virtual learning only in county schools and no sports or extracurricular events can be held.

La peste diezma Europa y el caballero se juega su vida en una partida de ajedrez con la muerte que viene a buscarlo. En una escena, entra en una iglesia e intenta confesarse ante un fraile cubierto con una capucha. Tarda en darse cuenta que debajo de ella se esconde la muerte. El caballero, desolado, le explica que su problema no es la fe, es el conocimiento y que la incapacidad de acceder a él es lo que no le da paz ni sosiego. No resolverá este problema el caballero. La muerte se lo llevará antes junto a todos los suyos.

AEW returns to pay-per-view with the 2020 edition of All Out this Labor Day weekend. One year ago, the event -- which helped set the tone for the promotion's cable television debut on TNT one month later -- featured a match to crown the inaugural AEW champion, with Chris Jericho scoring a victory over "Hangman" Adam Page. In the time since, Jericho has lost that title to Jon Moxley, who will now put his title on the line against rising superstar MJF. What's more, Moxley will have to defend the belt without being able to utilize his Paradigm Shift DDT finishing move, which has been banned for the match.


  Jericho, meanwhile, will face fan-favorite Orange Cassidy in a Mimosa Mayhem match, which can be won via pinfall, submission or by throwing your opponent into a tank of mimosa. That match comes after Jericho defeated Cassidy at Fyter Fest and Cassidy gaining a measure of revenge with a recent win on Dynamite.

Lone offenders and some small terrorist groups manage to sustain their campaigns on a shoestring budget. They have few members to train and equip, they rely on simple weapons such as knives, and they are not subject to the high and indirect costs of developing and maintaining a sizeable organisation. However, more sophisticated terrorist organisations require quite substantial amounts of money in order to survive and develop over longer periods of time. These groups tend to operate in a way that assumes some degree of social responsibility for their supporters by establishing a ‘humanitarian wing’ alongside the ‘military wing’, which complicates identifying funding for a terrorist group.

Last Friday, the PIAA declared that the season was a “go.” After a spring of cancellations and a summer where everything “Fall” was up in the air, our cross country season has started to take shape. I will resist the temptation to question whether or not the “shape” is made of a gelatin that will melt during some future COVID outbreak or whether it is a bit more solid… Our competition schedule has taken form: The original schedule has been replaced completely with dual meets, all composed of PHAC foes. The rule changes and recommendations have been ironed out. Our roster has started to take shape as “wait-and-see” athletes have either rushed to get their required sports physical or made the decision to step away from the field of competition. Team pictures are scheduled, the seniors have decided on a team apparel order, and the countdown to the first race has started.


  More than anything, the shape of who this team is and who this team could be is coming together as well. Today was the first time all season where we had five guys stick for the whole eight miles pushing each other and holding each other accountable in the group. As we recounted the ups and downs of the day’s run, I was struck by how moments come with a context and that in cross country, our “playing field” is Milton. With every step we take, the connection between our town and individual athletes increases. Today it was passing volunteers at the food bank behind Meadowbrook, debating which of us picked up the pace down Broadway, dodging the diners at Lisa’s Deli, grateful for water at Subway, discussing whether we should turn at Imperial Lanes or head down and turn at Spangler’s, jockeying for position as we ran on Cameron under the railroad bridge past “Chef’s,” and the pull of home as our feet hit King Street knowing that we have a quarter mile until the stadium. Where will tomorrow take us?

Four games into the restart and Tigers remain where they were in March before the season was suspended, second bottom of the Gallagher Premiership having suffered defeats to Exeter Chiefs, Bath and Gloucester - shipping 110 points in the process.      However, look within those matches and you will find some common themes. They have taken the lead in all four of their August games, including the 13-7 win over London Irish, and they have also displayed plenty of fight and resolve from desperate situations.      First up in round 14, the table-topping Chiefs piled on 26 unanswered points either side of half-time and a big score seemed on the cards at Sandy Park. But the final third belonged to Borthwick's men who scored the game's only points courtesy of a penalty try to lose 26-13.      Next, a fully-loaded Bath side arrived in Leicestershire and built a 38-6 with a third of the game remaining. Once more the Tigers rallied to score 10 unanswered points in the final 26 minutes to bring some respectability to the scoreline.

PC Sophie Davies of South Wales Police, who was involved in the investigation into Mr Holt's death, described the reason for the arrest during the inquest proceedings.


  She told the hearing that Mr Holt played an online game called Dungeons and Dragons and met another player on the game's Discord server who he was initially led to believe was an 18-year-old woman.


  The pair arranged to meet in Preston in September 2019 and Mr Holt booked an overnight stay at Preston International Hotel.


  In their conversations the pair would "role-play scenarios involving a zombie apocalypse" and made arrangements to meet in a cemetery on September 19.


  However the person who met Mr Holt was an 11-year-old girl and the pair "sat on a bench for about an hour talking," according to PC Davies.


  Despite her age, Mr Holt continued to message the child who "asked to be his girlfriend" and they arranged to meet again in Preston on February 14, Valentine's Day, this year.


  "The parents [of the girl] tried to stop the second visit when they became alarmed when they found out the child and Will had met.


  "On March 13 Will travelled to the hotel [in Preston] and was arrested on suspicion of grooming a child by Lancashire Police," said PC Davies.

Lionel Messi last week told Barcelona he was invoking a contract clause that allowed him to leave for free at the end of the season, but the club claimed that the clause had expired in June. Barcelona said it wanted Messi to stay until the end of his contract in June 2021. The contract has a buyout clause of 700 million euros ($837 million).


  Barcelona said it has offered the Argentine a two-year extension that would keep him with the club through the 2022-23 season. It also wanted to meet personally with the player to try to convince him to stay and finish his career with the club where he started playing nearly 20 years ago.


  Neither part made concessions in Wednesday’s meeting in Barcelona, with Jorge Messi confirming that his son wanted to leave and Barcelona reaffirming that it will not accept his transfer request. They have not scheduled another round of negotiations, but Barcelona said it still hoped Messi would change his mind about leaving.

A grant from the Federal Aviation Administration will help the East Texas Regional Airport complete plans for a major runway rehabilitation project in the next several years.
 The U.S. Department of Transportation announced the $865,543 grant this week as part of more than $1.2 billion going to airport safety and infrastructure projects across the country.
 “This is work in progress,” said East Texas Regional Airport Director Roy Miller.
 He explained that a study a few years ago of the pavement condition at the airport identified areas that needed rehabilitation. The grant, which the county must provide a match of 10%, will be used to plan and design what he described as a “fairly major project” on the airport’s primary, 10,000-foot runway.
 While some maintenance has been performed to that runway, it’s been more than 15 years since it’s had this type of rehabilitation project, Miller said.
 “Your average pavement life for asphalt is 10 or 12 years,” he said. “We’ve been lucky to extend ours as far as we have time wise.”
 The age, along with water damage and other factors, means it’s time for the entire runway to be overlaid and restriped. The intersection where the primary runway and the second runway meet also will be reconstructed, Miller said.
 He said the airport likely also will receive federal funding for the rehabilitation project, with the county already setting money aside for its match for that future expected grant. The recently adopted 2020-21 Gregg County budget includes $1 million toward the project. Miller said the runway rehabilitation could cost as much as $20 million, but that figure also will be estimated as part of the planning grant the county is receiving this year.
 Miller said the airport is in the process now of finalizing the engineering contract for this planning grant. Design will take six to nine months and must then be approved by the FFA. The actual work on the runway might not begin until 2022.

Prior research has shown that if you put a liquid into a tub, it will fill in the bottom of the tub—but if you pick up the tub and shake it vigorously up and down, the fluid will rise from the bottom of the tub and hover near the top. This is due to vibrations that compress the air below the fluid, preventing it from falling to the bottom. In this new effort, the researchers have found that there is something else that can be done using the same setup—float a boat on the underside of the levitating fluid.

La política sanitaria llevada a cabo en estos días da sentido a esta mirada. En El séptimo sello, el clásico de Ingmar Bergman, como es sabido, el caballero interpretado por Max Von Sidow, regresa a Suecia después de diez años de participar en las cruzadas. La peste diezma Europa y el caballero se juega su vida en una partida de ajedrez con la muerte que viene a buscarlo. En una escena, entra en una iglesia e intenta confesarse ante un fraile cubierto con una capucha. Tarda en darse cuenta que debajo de ella se esconde la muerte. El caballero, desolado, le explica que su problema no es la fe, es el conocimiento y que la incapacidad de acceder a él es lo que no le da paz ni sosiego. No resolverá este problema el caballero. La muerte se lo llevará antes junto a todos los suyos.

LIMA, Peru (AP) — A young woman caresses the grey marble urn containing her father's ashes. Other urns sit, like people, carefully placed on the seats of a bus delivering them to their loved ones. Burial was a tradition for both Peru’s indigenous Inca culture and the Spanish who colonized the country. But to prevent infection and save space in the capital’s overstretched cemeteries, people have begun to cremate the dead, fundamentally changing the rites and traditions that surround death. Associated Press photographer Rodrigo Abd visited the homes of the bereaved to document how they were creating spaces for the remains of their loved ones. Many of the grieving were still in shock, shaken by the death of their mother, father, sister, brother or child, and by the unexpected need to find a place for their ashes in the home where they had lived. Some created shrines for the dead, often in the places they most loved inside their homes. Others placed the ashes in a temporary space awaiting burial in a cemetery, sitting alongside everyday objects like bicycle parts, or on top of a shoe cabinet. Some say they are coming to like having the ashes close at hand, where they can place fresh flowers or place food and drink near their loved one's remains. For others, the urn becomes the center of an empty space, a reminder of their grief and inability to carry-out centuries-old traditions. The ashes of Alejandro Flores Rojas, 76, sit among wheel rims, gears and tools in his son's bicycle workshop. “For now my father will stay here in the workshop because these days I don’t have time to find a better place for him,'' said the son, 36-year-old Leonardo Neto Flores. The urn with the ashes of a 68-year-old woman sits in a tiny room where she lived with her husband. The walls...

With all of that said, we wish the Grand Wagoneer concept were a bit more retro-inspired. The upright rear end, contrast-painted roof, high hood, and swept-back windshield remind some of us of the Rivian R1S, while the illuminated and chrome-finished grille looks a bit like that of the forthcoming GMC Hummer EV. Your author, for example, thinks the concept is a fine-looking SUV, but a milquetoast Grand Wagoneer. A flat beltline that sits even with the hood and a triangular D-pillar would work wonders to connect this modern machine with its legendary forebear.

The lack of strikeouts may give you pause, but the more important development is that Tyler Mahle went beyond six innings for a second straight start. His overreliance on his fastball in past years made him a sitting duck the second and third time through the lineup, but now he has an effective slider/cutter to keep hitters honest. Given Anthony DeSclafani's recent struggles, Mahle has probably secured his spot in the rotation now, making that 3.90 ERA, 1.07 WHIP and 10.5 K/9 something to grab hold of.

Official communication with the BOP, even concerning local facilities, is through an Office of Public Affairs at the BOP in Washington.


  Emery Nelson, BOP Office of Public Affairs, replied that the bureau is abiding by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidance as well as that written by the BOP.


  An email message from Nelson said an action plan addressed operations, supply management, inmate movement and visitation and official staff travel with an objective of mitigating the spread of the virus.


  “We started limiting facility-to-facility transfers and other inmate movement, as well as implementing screening, quarantine and isolation procedures,” Nelson wrote. “In addition, we suspended social and legal visits, cancelled staff training and travel, limited access for contractors and volunteers, and established enhanced screening for staff and inmates, including temperature checks.”


  Nelson said all federal prisons were on “enhanced modified operations” in early April. Management also began inventorying or buying sanitation, cleaning and medical supplies.


  “Enhanced modified operations are not a lockdown, but rather a means to minimize inmate movement, to minimize congregate gathering, and maximize social distancing among the inmate population,” it was added. “Under enhanced modified operations inmates are limited in their movements within the institution. Inmate movement in small numbers (is) authorized for access to commissary, laundry, showers, telephone and electronic messaging access, medical and mental health care and some essential work details or work assignments.”


  Symptomatic inmates are not placed on work details or work assignments, which Nelson compared to communities required to shelter-in-place.

VENICE (AP) — Two stars at the Venice Film Festival, Cate Blanchett and Tilda Swinton, have praised the decision by the Berlin festival to award gender-neutral prizes, with Swinton predicting other award ceremonies will follow suit. Organizers of the Berlin International Film Festival announced last month that they would stop awarding separate acting prizes to men and women starting next year. The best actor and actress Silver Bear prizes will now be replaced by best leading performance and best supporting performance awards Swinton, who received a Golden Lion Lifetime Achievement award at the Venice festival’s opening ceremony, said divisions by gender were a “waste of life.” “And so I’m really happy to hear that about Berlin,” she told reporters Thursday. “And I think it’s pretty much inevitable that everybody will follow, because it’s just obvious to me.” Blanchett, president of the Venice jury this year, said she instinctively calls herself an “actor.” She said it's hard enough “to sit in judgment of other people’s work” and then even harder to break it down further along gender lines. “I’m of a generation where the word “actress” was used always in a pejorative sense. So I think I claim the other space,” she said. “I think good performances are good performances, no matter the sexual orientation of the performers who are making them.” The Venice festival has long been criticized for the lack of female directors in its in-competition films, with only four films made by women in the 62 films competing for the Golden Lion award between 2017 and 2019. This year, the gender parity has improved, with 44% of the in- competition films directed by women. Swinton was also in Venice to present a short film directed by Pedro...

On the principle of non-intervention, the statement recalls its status as a rule under customary international law and repeats the international consensus position that armed intervention or any attempt to subject a State in the exercise of its sovereign rights to the will of another State would constitute a breach of that rule. Regrettably, the statement uses imprecise language and does not directly refer to the two elements of a prohibited intervention – interference with matters falling into another State’s domaine réservé and the element of coercion – so it is not clear whether Iran regards all attempts to “threaten against the personality of state or political, economic, social, and cultural organs of it through cyber and any other tools” as a violation of the non-intervention principle, or only those which are of a coercive nature (which would conform to the established view). However, the statement offers some examples of actions which Iran would regard as illegal interventions:
