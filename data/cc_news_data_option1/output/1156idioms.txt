“Brought so close to finally felling Netanyahu, his anti-Netanyahu coalition may not be able to resist the win, and attempting to stop the legislation in mid-stream — it stops being a threat once it becomes law — may cost Gantz far more than a few MKs from his coalition. His prospect of serving first in a unity coalition will be gone, he won’t be able to build a stable coalition, and the advantage will pass to Netanyahu — who may then decide that a fourth election, and the likelihood of being able to overturn the legislation in the next Knesset, is the way to go. In fact, he may well find it preferable right now to negotiating with Gantz with that legislative sword of Damocles hanging over his head,” he writes.

"Images of America: Otsego and Plainwell" by Ryan Wieber and Sandy Stamm
 In 1831, Samuel Foster and his family built a log house near the rapids of the Kalamazoo River at what is now downtown Otsego.
 Soon others interested in utilizing the power afforded by the river set up sawmills and grain mills for newly arriving settlers, and the beginnings of a town quickly took shape. In the 1900s, Otsego became synonymous with the paper industry, and for a while, seven paper mills were in operation at the same time.
 Plainwell, originally called Plainfield and the Junction, situated itself at the crossroads of the old plank roads that led to Grand Rapids, Kalamazoo, and Allegan. Here too, the paper industry played an important part in the growth of Plainwell. Since the downtown area is completely surrounded by the Kalamazoo River and a millrace, it is now referred to as the Island City."
 Plainwell's historic heritage is evident today through its quaint downtown architecture and restored neighborhood homes. Otsego and Plainwell have grown up close to each other and share their stories, families, and traditions.
