Madhav, who is just recently married, is assigned to defend the accused, and he later brings in his former compadre, Nikhat. They soon realise that it isn't an open-and-shut case as it is perceived to be. For one, there is no clear motive as to why Anuradha would stab her husband. Secondly, she is in a daze after the crime and isn't willing to speak much on it. The daughter hates her mother for harming her father, but is holding something back. What was to be simple case of murder soon becomes a debate on domestic abuse and marital rape.

The Dull Middle Portions

There is one track about a cop couple (Ajeet Singh Palawat and Kalyanee Mulay) who have their own domestic problems which, while watchable for both the actors, don't make much of an impact. The need to make the husband cop so stubborn-minded about pinning the crime on the accused is never explored.

We also get to see Madhav having his own domestic strife with his new bride Ratna (Khusboo Atre). While that track is more light-hearted, we are oblivious as to why he behaves so coldly with her, so much that he never tells anyone that he is married. Or for the fact that this track also doesn't add much value to the narrative either. Similar is the case with Nikhat's family problems. We also get to hear her complain how her legal career will be ruined if she takes up the case, only for that discussion to never happen later.


--DocBreak--
What disappointed me the most, however, is that the subject of marital rape is only discussed on a superficial level, and is finally contained in a snarky quote of how justice is mostly about protecting men's rights. Deserves better!

Have to say, I loved the theme of the new season, as it delves on domestic abuse, both physical and emotional, in a marriage. The series points out that, through a mix of guilt-trips and gaslighting, how easy it is to convince a victim that she isn't being abused. The season works best when it explores the psychology of the victim in such scenarios.

It's like the show wanted to give some depth to these characters, and the only way it can think of doing that is adding some needless strife.

All well and good. The only trouble is we already get a whiff of that in the first couple of episodes, and then have to wait for the final episode for the series and the rest of the characters to get to that predictable conclusion.

No such luck here, though. Apart from the pregnancy matter, Anuradha's character doesn't see much growth in these sequences, and the track is soon made redundant by the time we reach the last couple of episodes. Even the addition of Ishani's character (Shilpa Shukla), a hotshot murder convict and a manipulative bully, don't bring much to the tale.

The first season of _Criminal Justice_ was inspired by BBC's British series by the same name (later adapted by HBO as _The Night Of_ ). It wasn't merely a legal drama, but also was a bitter prison drama and a murder mystery as well. While it may not have done complete justice to all aspects of the three-fold narrative, there are moments that stay with you in the season and performances by Vikrant Massey, Jackie Shroff and Tripathi bowl you over.


--DocBreak--
But again, the writing in the scenes goes for a more Bollywood treatment, taking convenience tropes to reach its conclusion, rather than meticulously deconstruct the path to justice. Even Anuradha dropping her silence to talk about her trauma felt strangely vacuous, because it was rushed by then.


--DocBreak--
The most irksome track is the one involving Anuradha's jailtime. Like with the first season, there is a subplot involving the protagonist's miserable experience in prison, trying to adjust with the harsh conditions there, while being pregnant. In the first season, this track offered plenty of gritty moments, and also a chance to further develop the character of the protagonist. Not to mention, seeing Shroff in one of his best roles in recent times.
