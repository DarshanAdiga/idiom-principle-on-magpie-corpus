Wipro has signed an agreement to repurpose one of its technology campuses in Pune into a 450-bed intermediary care Covid-19 hospital, with plans in place to hand over to the state government by 30 May.
 The four-week turnaround, confirmed following a memorandum of understanding with the Government of Maharashtra, will include 12 beds to stabilise critical patients before moving to a tertiary care facility. Designed to treat moderate cases, the “independent and isolated” Covid-19 complex also includes 24 rooms to accommodate doctors and medical staff.
 Wipro will provide the physical infrastructure, medical furniture and equipment besides appointing an administrator and skeletal support staff to help operationalise the hospital quickly with the required medical professionals. The hospital is expected to be converted back to an IT facility after 12 months.

SWANTON — Correlations between math, basketball, and coaching may not be the norm for everyone, but for Taylor Coppenrath, the three flow together naturally.
 “I’m trying to raise expectations for both and push and challenge students to get better at basketball and math,” explained Coppenrath.
 “I had a good high school experience with my teachers. Not everyone feels that way, so I’m asking myself, ‘how can I make it the best, but also raise expectations so that everyone is learning.’”
 Coppenrath, known for his successful basketball career at UVM, encourages students to employ the same concepts in the classroom that they use on the court.
 “We know what it takes to get better at things. If you’re going to get better at basketball, you have to practice, and the same applies to math,” said Coppenrath.
 “It’s human nature to avoid the things we don’t like to do. I’m trying to convince my students that they can still work hard at something even if they aren’t passionate about it.
 “If I see someone work hard to do something they don’t enjoy, I know they can do exceedingly well at something they really care about.”
 Coppenrath, whose UVM jersey was retired in October of 2019, used his competitive nature to help him excel in academics and athletics.
 “I’m very competitive, and I took math on as a competition. I was determined to understand the concepts, no matter what it took.
 “That competitive nature went hand in hand with math and basketball. When things get difficult, do you give up, or do you find a way to win?”
 During his years at UVM (2001-2005), Coppenrath led the Catamounts to three straight American East Conference titles. He was the second all-time scoring leader for the program with 2,442 points.
 He led UVM in field goals made (851), was fifth all-time in rebounding (839) and blocked shots (83). Along with Reggie Lewis, he’s one of two players to win three America East Conference Player of the Year awards.
 In his senior year, Coppenrath was a finalist for the John Wooden Award for National Player of the Year, the only finalist ever from the America East.
 That season was also the most successful in Vermont men’s basketball history. After capturing the Conference title, the team defeated Syracuse University for its first NCAA Tournament victory ever.
 “I’d like to think that our success at UVM stemmed from the fact that we had a bunch of guys that came together and found ways to be successful,” said Coppenrath.
 “Every player was so vital to our team’s success, just like every student is vital to the success of our classes.
 “You can take this idea of team sports and incorporate it into your classroom. We’re a community, a team. We’re here for everyone to gain confidence and be successful.”
 Sometimes, as an athlete or a student, you have to get creative.
 “In math and sports, there’s always structure, but there’s also the flexibility to get to an answer in different ways.
 “In basketball, I need to get the ball in the hoop, but if this big guy’s in my way, I may have to make a pass or a cut or a ball fake,” explained Coppenrath.
 “In math, being able to think about how to solve a problem and get around obstacles is equally valuable, and it may require asking a teacher.”
 Ultimately, getting out and ‘playing’ is the best way to learn and grow.
 “You need to participate. The best rebounders go after the rebound, and in math, just like basketball, the most successful students are looking to improve all aspects by trying and learning.”
 Coppenrath noted that a teacher’s response can play a vital role in a student’s education.
 “Providing feedback in a positive way is vital,” explained Coppenrath.
 “I learned more when I started teaching because I had to understand concepts well enough to explain them to others.”
 Coppenrath applied an adage to make another point.
 “Practice makes progress in basketball and math. When I was at UVM, I took one hundred free throws a day, and my teammate T.J. Sorrentine shot thousands of shots,” said Coppenrath.
 “If you want to get better at math, you need to practice and get it into your long term memory. You also need to make sure that you’re understanding what you’re doing.”
 Work ethic and attitude also played key roles in Coppenrath’s success.
 “A lot of people, including my AAU coach, gave me good advice. He encouraged me to work hard because coaches noticed the effort of a hard-working player even more than the talented players who weren’t working as hard.”
 Hard work paid big dividends for Coppenrath, and the retiring of his jersey was one more recognition for a career well played.
 “I had no idea that my jersey would be retired or that I’d be one of the leading scorers at UVM or one of the top athletes coming out of the state of Vermont for basketball,” said Coppenrath, candidly.
 “I just followed the passion I had for the sport and persisted in getting better and continuing to play as long as possible.”
 Sorrentine and Coppenrath’s UVM jerseys were retired together in October.
 “T.J. and I were a package deal the whole way. We went into the UVM Hall of Fame together along with Coach Brennan, we had our jerseys retired, and Coach had the court named after him. We’re always wondering if there’s anything left to do,” said Coppenrath with a chuckle.
 “T.J. was a great leader, and he was passionate about the game,” said Coppenrath.
 “We had fun working hard and getting better. The goal was to have fun by winning, and you don’t win unless you get better, and you get better by putting in the work.”
 Coppenrath thanked his family and his community for their incredible support.
 “My parents worked very hard, they made our childhood very special, and they made sacrifices for us, which was huge.
 “My wife continued to support me as I was playing, and it’s something we hope to pass on to our kids--to work hard, enjoy what you’re doing, but also to try to improve on the areas that you don’t feel as passionate about.
 “I feel so lucky and blessed that I grew up in a small town. At every step, from high school to UVM, I had a community behind me. It just got a little bit bigger each time.”

And on the Medicare Advantage discussion, there are people all over the place. I think this is the way we view it. It’s a rate negotiation. We are very comfortable with our capability and the outcomes that we are giving people and many of these payers have history with us and they know that we provide good outcomes and we can manage these patients in a tighter band than probably anyone else. So we’re just going to have to see how it plays out over time.

And you will be seeing something in the next few weeks from us that shows that we're not thinking in the same way as many of our competitors but we are going to do some very different things with products and applications that will allow growers to utilize our products at the right point in time for their applications, therefore, would be much more sustainable in terms of amount of product used and where it is used. So stay tuned. This will be the first move we're making, but we will be making more moves. We have some very, very novel and interesting ideas of where we can take technology, that's not core to our base, but will be enabled by the growers in distribution.

ONTARIO — Based on initial projections of funding reductions from the state, Treasure Valley Community College officials have begun to cut the college’s budget as they address the economic fallout of the novel coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic.
 In a letter shared last Friday on campus, President Dana Young said the projections — which fluctuate almost daily — as of Friday the college could expect at least a 17% decrease in funding from the state next year, which would mean a $1.34 million cut to the college’s General Fund.
 The 2020-21 budget meeting will be held May 19 via zoom or by telephone.
 To prepare for the probability of a loss in state revenue, administrators have begun a first-round of position and budget cuts for the remainder of this year and next year, Young wrote.
 Three people were immediately laid off. This included one person each in the testing center, the business office, and the institutional effectiveness office. Those reductions were the first steps taken to balance the college budget for next year, she said. Further cuts which are in the works include 5% and 10% reductions to staff.
 The novel coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic isn’t just impacting revenues; it is also impacting labor negotiations.
 The college has been in salary negations with the TVCC faculty and had offered a one-time 1% salary bonus, according to Young. However, in light of the early budget impacts, faculty volunteered to forego any increases next year, she wrote, saving the college $26,000.
 “We are appreciative of their collective willingness to help and to try and save jobs,” Young said.
 The plan was to give the classified staff a 2% increase next year, but the goal is now to try and preserve as many positions as possible. However, there are still additional budget cut considerations for professional and administrative staff, including possible layoffs, furlough days and temporary reductions.
 Final state revenue projections are set to come in on May 20, giving the college a better idea of whether projected cuts will hold at the 17% level, or if they will be higher. Speculations have predicted the decrease to be as much as 24%.
 “We are cautiously hopeful that community colleges might received some of the COVID-19 federal crisis funds or a portion of the rainy day funds from the state that might be help to mitigate the impact of this crisis.
 Young noted that the economic toll of the pandemic is being felt by every college and university across the state and the nation.

_Dividend_
 Saratoga Investment has raised its dividend for the past five years. In light of the dramatic uncertainties currently present in the economy, and to ensure we retain liquidity to not only support our current portfolio companies during these challenged times, but to also create new, important relationships through the provision of critically crucial liquidity in new situations, Saratoga Investment's Board of Directors (the "Board of Directors") believes it is in the best near- and long-term interests of our shareholders to maintain a conservative and cautious approach to our dividend policy.
 Furthermore, while many BDCs have spillover obligations from prior years, representing taxable income from past obligations yet to be distributed, Saratoga Investment has historically managed its distributions conservatively so it is current with all spillover obligations, other than those related to our Easy Ice and Censis long-term capital gains. This therefore means that Saratoga Investment is not obligated to pay current dividends related to historical earnings and enabling preservation of precious liquidity in this challenging market environment.
 The Board of Directors has therefore decided to defer our dividend for the quarter ended February 29, 2020. We will continue to reassess this decision on at least a quarterly basis as we gain more visibility on the economy and business activities.
 In fiscal year 2020, the Company declared a quarterly dividend of $0.56 per share for the quarter ended November 30, 2019, $0.56 per share for the quarter ended August 31, 2019, $0.55 per share for the quarter ended May 31, 2019 and $0.54 per share for the quarter ended February 28, 2019. Total dividends declared for the fiscal years ended February 28, 2019, and 2018, were $2.06 per share and $1.90 per share, respectively.
 Shareholders have the option to receive payment of dividends in cash or receive shares of common stock, pursuant to the Company's DRIP.
 _Share Repurchase Plan_
 In fiscal year 2015, the Company announced the approval of an open market share repurchase plan that allows it to repurchase up to 200,000 shares of its common stock at prices below its NAV as reported in its then most recently published financial statements. During fiscal year 2017, the share repurchase plan was increased to 600,000 shares of common stock, and during fiscal years 2018, 2019 and 2020, this share repurchase plan was extended for another year at the same level of approval, currently through January 15, 2021. On May 4, 2020, the Board of Directors increased the share repurchase plan to 1.3 million shares of common stock. As of February 29, 2020, the Company purchased 218,491 shares of common stock, at the average price of $16.87 for approximately $3.7 million pursuant to this repurchase plan.
 Saratoga Investment made no purchases of common stock in the open market during the three months ended February 29, 2020.

NEW YORK (AP) — While thousands of small businesses waited for coronavirus relief money to arrive, they were shutting down and laying off workers.Two reports issued this week shed light on the crisis that business owners have been struggling through since the coronavirus hit. On Wednesday, payroll provider ADP said its small business customers slashed more than 11 million jobs in April as they were forced to close or suffered steep revenue losses amid the virus outbreak.And nearly 30% of businesses questioned for a U.S. Chamber of Commerce-MetLife report said they had closed during April, a statistic that helps explain the big drop in payrolls last month. The survey was taken from April 21-27 and questioned 500 companies.Nearly a third of the businesses surveyed said they applied or tried to apply for loans under the government's Paycheck Protection Program, and just 9% had received loan money. Only 48% said they were comfortable with their cash flow — a critical factor in businesses being able to operate. That was down from 80% before the virus hit.The survey was taken largely during the period when loan approvals were on hold because the first $349 billion round of funding had been exhausted on April 16. Thousands of applications sat at banks while Congress debated and eventually approved a $310 billion extension, and approvals resumed on April 27.As of late Tuesday, the Small Business Administration had approved nearly 2.4 million loans totaling $181 billion in the second round of funding. In the first round, it approved 1.7 million loans. The higher number of loans indicates that smaller loans being sought by smaller companies are being approved.The numbers from both the ADP and Chamber/MetLife reports reflect the social distancing restrictions state and local governments began implementing in mid to late March, which forced the closure of many small businesses including stores, restaurants, gyms and sports and entertainment venues. But officials in many areas have begun relaxing those restrictions, which may lead to a reversal of some of the job losses.However, even companies that remained open have been losing business as customers stayed home or cut back their spending. While companies that cater to consumers have been hard hit, businesses that serve other businesses also have seen their revenue drop.The ADP report counts jobs lost at the payroll provider's business customers with under 500 workers. The smallest companies, those with fewer than 20 workers, cut nearly 3.4 million jobs and those with 20 to 49 employees cut 2.6 million.The Labor Department has reported that more than 30 million people have sought unemployment benefits since the virus hit.April’s losses reported by ADP surpassed the 170,000 jobs cut in March. By comparison, companies added more than 31,000 jobs on average each month during 2019.ADP also tallied more than 20 million jobs lost at all its business customers in April. The Labor Department’s April jobs report on Friday will also show the extent of the overall damage to the economy from the virus outbreak.Copyright 2020 Associated Press. All rights reserved.

That's a great question, Carly. And we need to look at it on over longer period of time. We still believe that the United States will need that oil. Our assumption is that export won't be as cheap anymore because the outside countries like Russia or OPEC won't allow United States to export as many barrels that it used to be, but at the same time all will be needed inside the United States. So we are going to look at that bit more in light of not only exports, but oil that is needed in other places of the country and how other people will modify their behavior.

“Things move around so much between now and at the end of the cycle,” he said. “That said, I do think that last year’s class, while very good, it did not have the top-end talent that this class has so far. … I think the top end of this class has a good chance to carry this class right up until signing day.”
 Minnesota's current collection will need to add offensive linemen, with only 6-foot-7, 245-pound Annandale tackle Logan Purcell committed so far. Last year the Gophers capitalized on seeing O-linemen at camps, something they likely won’t be able to do now as the coronavirus pandemic continues to sideline sports.
 The Gophers received nine commitments in April, an impressive haul considering the NCAA put a moratorium on in-person recruiting on and off campus due to COVID-19.
 “Whatever comes, we will adapt,” Fleck said of the Gophers' recruiting strategy last week. “We cannot let the result fade because of the circumstance. We actually have to be better. Our recruiting staff has done a great job of putting together virtual tours.”
 Trieu said Minnesota was “ahead of the game” on virtual visits for recruits to see the campus, stadium and practice facility without having to leave their homes.
 “You see other schools molding themselves after that,” Trieu said. “I do think there are some copycats. … (Minnesota’s) video department has done a great job. They are not just slapping together some videos. I think that at the end of this class, we are going to say, ‘Coach Fleck and some assistants are great recruiters.’ And I think their social media staff and their video staff are the unsung heroes.”
 Fleck repeatedly has said players commit more to a particular coach and a culture than a school, its facilities or other factors.
 “One great thing about Coach Fleck is he is very self-aware, so he knows that his style is going to suit certain types of players personality wise better than others,’ Trieu said. “He will not compromise on that just to recruit a guy. He is who he is, and if you vibe with that, then ‘C’mon and be a Gopher.’ If you don’t think it’s a good fit from your recruitment, then it probably wouldn’t have worked out for you as a player at Minnesota anyway.”
 Dickerson is lockdown cover corner at 5-foot-10 and 165 pounds. Since his freshman year in high school, he has given up just one one passing touchdown while also displaying playmaking ability as a running back and wide receiver.
 With those skills, Froendt said Dickerson wasn’t swayed by recruiting hype.
 “Conferences didn’t matter; traditions didn’t matter; geography didn’t matter,” Froendt said. “It was about, A., relationship with coaches. And B, who could develop him to possibly get to the next level as an athlete and as a man.”
 On Dickerson’s recruitment, Froendt said Fleck and the Cornhuskers’ Scott Frost were the only head coaches continually involved in the courtship. Gophers safeties coach Joe Harasymiak was one of the first assistants in the nation to visit Dickerson in Omaha; Iowa State was the first to offer a scholarship.
 “The Minnesota coaching staff did an amazing job, basically out-recruiting people,” Froendt said. “They formed great relationships. They were genuine. They were relentless.”

On to some of the metrics. In the first quarter, we added 1 new borrower to nonaccrual status. So total nonaccruals stood at 2.2% at fair value and 5.4% of cost. The weighted average internal risk rating remained 2.3. There's an inherent lag in when we'll see the impact of the pandemic flow through to our borrowers' financial results. Even when our borrowers report March quarterly results, we expect, in many cases, a somewhat muted impact of the current environment. So we're taking a closer look at our risk rating methods for the June quarter, with a view towards making it more forward-looking in effort to provide greater clarity and transparency.

PAYETTE — With students who need in-person help with assignments being allowed back into Payette High School on Wednesday, the newspaper reached out to Payette School District Board of Trustees regarding the move.
 In light of state criteria that were established, the board set up a re-entry plan for the high school.
 According to the school’s re-entry plan, they will be allowing students (and the occasional parent) can receive additional support from a teacher.
 For the reopening, plexiglass shields separate teachers and students, who meet in large common areas where workstations are 6 feet apart and are sanitized between meetings.
 The school is also planning “make-shift study halls” in the high school’s gymnasium and in the middle school commons during the month of May.
 The school will be prohibiting medically vulnerable staff members (or those who have direct care for medically vulnerable persons) from working directly with students. All staff members working with students will be expected to wear masks and gloves and will observe social distancing guidelines.
 Students will also be screened prior to entry of the building, including a questionnaire to see if they are at risk, and a temperature scan will be conducted.
 The decision to reopen the school was approved by the Payette School District Board of Trustees on Monday. Board Chairman Adam Rynearson said the decision was made as a way to make sure that the students are all able to succeed through distance learning.
 “We decided to re-open for students who need face-to-face help, because everyone’s home learning environment and learning needs are different,” Rynearson said. “In public education we have to consider every student. This won’t be what students are used to at first but it is an important first step to return to normal.”
 In order to help with social distancing, students are encouraged set up meetings with teachers ahead of time.

Depending on the price recovery trajectory, we could see lower shut-ins in June. For the time being, we don't see a visible rebound in shut-in production unless WTI recovers back above $30/bbl and holds above that level.
 By the end of this year, we expect a small recovery in US oil production. The current drop in production will force market participants to reprice oil prices by the end of Q3. We estimate that as supplies greatly underwhelm in the coming weeks, global inventories will start to top out and move lower throughout the summer months.
 By Q4, WTI should recover back to $40 to $50, if not higher, and in this scenario, producers will start completing wells to offset some of the declines in production. We see a scenario where US oil production finishes the year between 10.5 and 11 mb/d, assuming a restart in completion activity in Q4.

I would say yes to that. Ghana is an asset that we still consider to be up for sale. Whether Total buys it or not, it would still be up for sale. And there has been some interest in it. So that's something that we would still pursue divesting. I think I said earlier, but let me reiterate that. At the early beginning of the year, when we looked at Algeria and Ghana's divestiture targets, we wanted to have an alternative. And the alternative that we came up with would deliver similar proceeds with a similar reduction in cash flow. So we started marketing in early this year an alternative to the sale of Algeria and Ghana. We started that process. And as we got into the process, all the travel restrictions were applied. And this is one of those things where we need people to come in and we need to do management presentations. We need to dive into details with the technical team that's assessing the value of that asset. So it's one that requires a little more interaction. So we have put that on hold right now as we wait for travel restrictions to be lifted and for the environment to get better.
