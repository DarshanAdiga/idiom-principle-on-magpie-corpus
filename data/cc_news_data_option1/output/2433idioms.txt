The Legislature adjourned Friday - leaving black lawmakers convinced that their colleagues had failed to rise to the moment.


  “The entire world is speaking out, but are Tennessee legislators listening?” asked Rep. Antonio Parkinson, a Black Democrat from Memphis.


  A Democratic-backed police reform proposal was blocked on the House floor. A budget request to expand postpartum health insurance for low-income and uninsured women — to halt “preventable” deaths of new mothers, which historically have had a disproportionate impact on women of color — was shot down.


  Instead, white Republicans in charge of both the House and Senate pursued reforms of their own. A bill that would have increased penalties against protesters who violate certain laws gained more support among top GOP leadership, though it was eventually abandoned in the final hours of session. The proposal would have made it a felony to camp on or vandalize state property with graffiti — a violation that is currently a misdemeanor.

Sophie Turner and Joe Jonas are soon going to turn parents. While the couple has been tight-lipped about the pregnancy, Sophie confirmed she was going to embrace motherhood soon by flaunting her baby bump recently. The Game of Thrones actress has been quarantining with the Jonas Brothers singer since the lockdown was announced. They have stepped out a couple of times, to run errands, show their support towards the Black Lives Matter movement and just take walks. However, the couple was seen out and about on Sunday, which also marked Father's Day, to enjoy some ice cream.

We’re just a couple of days into summer, and we’ve been treated to very summer-like conditions the last couple of days. Temperatures and humidity have gone up and storms have been around each afternoon. We’ll have a very similar day today, as a disturbance arrives from the Ohio River Valley this afternoon. As temperatures climb into the upper 80’s and lower 90’s, storms are expected to fire up to the west over the mountains between 2-4 PM. These will push east into the evening, with a few having the potential to become strong enough to produce gusty winds and heavy rain. The one catch to the forecast is if storms develop to the east, closer to the Chesapeake Bay, as well this afternoon. If this does happen, the storms to the west could fizzle out as they head this direction during the evening.

To the letter writer who bemoans the parking spaces taken up by empty Jump bike racks. I for one loved the Jump bikes. I used them to get to stores that were farther than I wanted to ride. Then the COVID-19 prevented the use of shared bikes, and I powered myself from midtown to Swift Street. Guess what, turns out it wasn’t that far. Now I do that errand on my bike every Saturday.

Doctors treating Italian auto racing champion-turned-Paralympic gold medalist Alex Zanardi say he remains stable after a crash on his handbike but is at risk of unforeseen complications.                    In a new medical update Sunday, the Santa Maria alle Scotte hospital in Siena said the longer Zanardi’s vital signs remain stable, the better off he is. But the update warned that his neurological condition remained grave and that doctors cannot “exclude the possibility of adverse events.”                    Zanardi, who lost both of his legs in an auto racing crash nearly 20 years ago, has been in a medically induced coma and on a ventilator since he crashed his handbike into a truck near the Tuscan town of Pienza during a relay race Friday.                    Doctors say he suffered serious facial and cranial trauma and have warned of possible brain damage.

But U.S. officials all along have been suspicious of Sessions' activities in Venezuela. Sessions had no obvious links to the country besides writing a letter in 2004 to the country's banking regulators in support of financier Allen Stanford, a former Sessions donor who in 2012 was convicted in Texas and sentenced to 110 years in prison for running a $7 billion-plus Ponzi scheme.

Zoe continued: “Before Letting the Future In Nathan was very confused, he was in a constant state of anxiety, would lose his temper easily, very reactional, would avoid certain situations and was unable to articulate why he didn’t want to do certain things.


  “Letting the Future In has helped pick that apart and pinpoint it. It was really helpful to address the feelings, get him to identify what he was feeling, what was making him feel like that and slowly build his confidence, understanding and coping mechanisms around it.”


  The NSPCC has helped Nathan come to terms with what has happened and supported him to move forward with his life.


  Zoe says that the charity’s prevention programmes such as #TalkPANTS and ‘Speak out. Stay safe’ are crucial to ensuring other children are protected from sexual abuse.

"You're used to being in a classroom for the offseason stuff," Heath said. "Learning a new defense in a virtual sense is not ideal but I thin our coaches have done a great job preparing for the meetings and I feel we get a lot done. I've been able to pick it up pretty well. But it's one thing to know your job on paper and another to execute it."

Heath's tackling at the time was hit and miss, and it continued that way in 2018. Last season, Heath turned the weakness into a strength. According to Profootballfocus.com, Heath was the NFL's most efficient tackler, with one miss per 30 attempts. Tackling has for the most part been an issue for the Raiders for years.

Dynamo Moscow said Sunday that three of its players had tested positive for the coronavirus as its game on the Russian soccer league’s restart weekend was postponed.                    Dynamo said the team and staff were confined to its training base after the positive tests for forward Clinton N’Jie and midfielders Charles Kaboré and Sebastian Szymanski. All other players tested negative in samples taken Saturday, the club added.                    Dynamo was due to play third-place FC Krasnodar on Sunday but Krasnodar agreed to a postponement. The Russian Football Union set July 19 as the new date for the game.                    It’s the second game to be disrupted by the coronavirus since the Russian league restarted Friday after a three-month pause.
