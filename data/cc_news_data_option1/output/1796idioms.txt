Prices could fluctuate in the coming weeks as gasoline demand increases in the region as Texas and other states begin to reopen, an AAA analysis indicates. Since prices went up in other states, Texas regained a spot on the travel agency’s list of states with the top 10 cheapest gas prices. The Lone Star State sits at No. 6 currently.
 “Demand for gasoline is on the rise, and that could mean a price increase at the pump for drivers in the coming weeks,” AAA Texas spokesperson Daniel Armbruster said in the release. “However, gasoline demand levels remain far below last year’s figures, and that’s helping keep gas prices cheaper year- over-year.”
 Gasoline demand increased to around 6.7 million barrels per day, according to the latest report by the U.S. Energy Information Administration. That’s up from the nearly 5.9 million barrels per day the week prior. The EIA also reports refinery utilization remained flat at 75% in the Gulf Coast region last week. At the national level, refinery utilization is also flat week-over- week coming in at 70%.
 Prices were up to date at press time using market prices posted at 3:41 a.m. Thursday.
