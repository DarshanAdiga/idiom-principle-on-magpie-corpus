For Keegan Bradley, it was a battle. Staked to a two-shot lead going into the weekend, he had three bogeys on the front nine before he hit a hybrid from 255 yards to 15 feet for an egle on the 11th hole. He finished with seven pars for a 73, though he was very much in the picture.

BETHESDA, Maryland: President Donald Trump's hospitalisation stretched into a third day on Sunday (Oct 4) as he and his health team sought to clarify contradictory statements and confusion from the day before that raised questions about the seriousness of his fight with COVID-19.
 Doctors were set to provide a briefing on Trump's health late Sunday morning.

“Really, really pleased, it’s a good start for him - an assist last week and a goal this week.”
 Adelakun has struggled for minutes, having played just nine games while on loan at Rotherham last season, but once he gets up to full fitness, City can expect even more, according to the Tigers boss.
 “He’s not up to speed yet, he’s got a bit to do still. You can see the glimpses of his quality, you can see how calm he is on the ball, he’s just really, really good,” the City boss continued.

Right now, any understanding of half the country begins and ends with the fact they loathe and distrust the media. Perhaps not all of that anger at the media is justified, but it’s righteous enough, especially after last week. For once, the media were handed a Russian influence-peddling scandal on a silver platter and the vast majority of major outlets _declined to even mention it_. Such bad behavior makes the calculus for determining who’s a bigger threat pretty clear for a lot of Trump supporters. Even if the president does and says things that make them uncomfortable, he’ll be gone in four months or four years. A media that hides the truth this brazenly is going to be much harder to get rid of.

3\. Don't be worried about the Blades yet: So, they've lost seven games on the trot (dating back to the end of last season) but Sheffield United have been working hard, staying in most of those games and Chris Wilder won't be too worried. Yet. Defeats to Wolves, Aston Villa, Leeds and Arsenal all by one goal shouldn't be too alarming but just one goal across those four games shows why they bought Rhian Brewster from Liverpool earlier this week. The Blades remain tough to play against and they've been unlucky with injuries. They had so many one-goal victories last season but now they're on the wrong end of those. Sheffield United should have enough to stay out of a relegation battle but they have to start scoring.

1\. Arsenal grinding it out: This was hardly a vintage Arsenal display but it epitomized their new gritty spirit under Mikel Arteta as they have started the season with three wins from four games. This result took character and patience and Arsenal hardly put a foot wrong defensively as they stood firm. Again, not a classic Arsenal performance but they dug deep.

For Joe Biden to tell the American people this accusation is “totally discredited,” when the media hadn’t even touched the story, well, honest fact- checkers would tell it like it is: Joe Biden stood up in front of tens of millions of Americans on Tuesday night and told a self-serving lie – a lie that would have been called a four-alarm trouser conflagration if Trump had said it.

“He’s a top player and when he gets on the ball you see that quality he’s got,” Calvert-Lewin said of Rodríguez. “He draws people in and opens space up for other players and for me, as a center forward, he creates chances and that’s all I can hope for.”

In an evening health update, Conley said Trump had been up and moving around his medical suite without difficulty and conducting business. “While not yet out of the woods, the team remains cautiously optimistic,” he said.
 Meanwhile, Trump’s handling of the pandemic and his own health faced new scrutiny.
 Trump’s medical care is far superior to the average American’s, with around- the-clock attention and experimental treatments. In the hospital video, he defended his decision to continue campaigning and holding large events during a pandemic.
 “I had no choice,” said Trump, who refused to abide by basic public health recommendations, including mask-wearing. "I had to be out front. ... I can’t be locked up in a room upstairs and totally safe. ... As a leader, you have to confront problems.”  
 Trump is 74 years old and clinically obese, putting him at higher risk of serious complications from a virus that has infected more than 7 million people nationwide and killed more than 209,000 people in the US.
 First lady Melania Trump remained at the White House to recover from her own bout with the virus.
 Trump's administration has been less than transparent with the public throughout the pandemic, both about the president’s health and the virus's spread inside the White House.
 The first word that a close aide to Trump had been infected came from the media, not the White House. And aides have repeatedly declined to share basic health information, including a full accounting of the president’s symptoms, what tests he’s undertaken and the results.
