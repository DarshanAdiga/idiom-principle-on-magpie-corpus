WARSAW, Poland (AP) — Poland's government is divided and reportedly struggling for its survival over whether to hold a mail-in presidential election in May during the coronavirus pandemic. The parliament on Monday is expected to vote on a proposal put forward by ruling party leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski to hold the May 10 election by postal vote. But one faction in the governing coalition is opposed to a mail-in vote and wants the election postponed until after the epidemic. The parliament had been expected to vote Friday on the postal option but that got delayed by the disagreement. It was not yet clear if the sides would find a compromise on Monday. “At a time that the state is experiencing its biggest problems in 30 years due to the cororavirus, the power camp is caught up in an internal war,” an analysis in the online news portal Onet said. “Our sources in the governing camp are unanimous in stressing that this crisis could lead to the collapse of the government,” the authors, Andrzej Gajcy and Andrzej Stankiewicz, wrote. Conservative President Andrzej Duda has been leading in polls as he vies for a second five-year term. the ruling Law and Justice party — which supports Duda — has been seeking a way to go ahead with the voting, with polls showing Duda far ahead of his rivals. Law and Justice leaders want to hold the vote now to consolidate power at a time of crisis. Many feel if Duda were to face a vote in a few months, when the economic pain of the coronavirus lockdown is more painfully felt, he would be less likely to win. The main opposition party, Civic Platform, has been calling for the government to declare a state of emergency, a legal step that would trigger an automatic postponement of the election. Opposition lawmakers say holding an...

VIRUS OUTBREAK-SOUTH CAROLINAMandatory legislator quarantine sought after SC sessionCOLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — A South Carolina lawmaker is seeking a “mandatory quarantine at home” for all state legislators following this week’s special session amid the coronavirus outbreak. State Rep. Justin Bamberg wrote to House Speaker Jay Lucas on Sunday, noting that he supports the decision for lawmakers to hold the one-day House and Senate sessions Wednesday. But he also said that the legislators’ gatherings “run counter to the mandates and suggestions in place for our citizens.” A spokeswoman for Lucas did not immediately return an email message seeking comment Sunday afternoon.BUDGET PROJECTIONS-SOUTH CAROLINASouth Carolina to get new, lower budget predictionCOLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — The board that predicts how much money South Carolina will take in from taxes and fees to help set the budget is meeting Thursday. The Revenue and Fiscal Affairs Board postponed March’s meeting for three weeks after the coronavirus caused a massive economic downturn and some 100,000 people to report they lost their jobs in two weeks. Economists agree South Carolina won't have $1.8 billion extra to spend as earlier predicted and the House budget passed last month must be rewritten. It will be up to the board to decide the new revenue figures.PANTHERS-PRACTICE FACILITYCarolina Panthers buy land for new practice facility in SCROCK HILL, S.C. (AP) — Property records show the Carolina Panthers have spent more than $16 million to buy the land for its new practice facility in South Carolina. The York County property records obtained by The Herald of Rock Hill say the NFL team wrapped up the deal to buy 240 acres near Interstate 77 in Rock Hill on March 27. The site is not currently in Rock Hill, but the city plans to annex it soon. Local officials want to create an entertainment complex with hotels and restaurants. The team hopes to open the practice facility in 2022. The Panthers will continue to play their games in Charlotte, North Carolina.VIRUS OUTBREAK-SOUTH CAROLINAVirus deaths at 40 in South Carolina; infections pass 1,900COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — State officials say the coronavirus has killed 40 people in South Carolina and confirmed infections now exceed 1,900 statewide. The state Department of Health and Environmental Control reported its latest figured on the virus outbreak Saturday afternoon. Sheriff's departments in York and Lexington counties said each had one employee who has tested positive for COVID-19 and that both are under quarantine at home. Meanwhile, Charleston police said two businesses _ a salon and a gym _ have been cited for remaining open in violation of the city's shelter-at-home ordinance.STATE POLICE ACCREDITATIONSC state police receive accreditation and high honorCOLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — South Carolina’s state police agency has again been accredited by a major law enforcement organization. The State Law Enforcement Division said it was also given an extra award by the Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement Agencies Inc. CALEA gave the state agency its excellence award. SLED first sought and obtained accreditation from CALEA in 1994. This is the third time the agency has received the organization’s seal of approval. SLED Chief Mark Keel says it is critical his agents be held to the highest standards.LEGISLATURE RETURNSSome Democrats say SC Legislature meeting is unsafeCOLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — South Carolina lawmakers are coming back to the Statehouse Wednesday, but not everyone is happy the Republican dominated House and Senate will be in session as the coronavirus spreads. Democratic state Sen. Mia McLeod of Columbia says she won't risk her life. She has sickle cell anemia. McLeod says it sends the wrong message for 170 lawmakers and staff to meet in one place when everyone else is being asked to stay apart. Democratic Sen. Thomas McElveen says the state constitution allows the governor to move the session if disease makes it unsafe. He suggests a basketabll arena. Gov. Henry McMaster says he has not received any requests.

FIUMICINO, Italy (AP) — Italy’s fishermen still go out to sea at night, but not as frequently in recent weeks since demand is down amid the country's devastating coronavirus outbreak. As a result, they are barely covering their expenses. An elderly fisherman sits on the dock in the harbor at Fiumicino, a Rome suburb. He fixes a fishing net while waiting for trawlers to return from their night at sea. He and his assistant wear face masks to protect themselves against coronavirus, even though they are the only two people around. On sunny days, people would normally be strolling along the wharf of this town near Rome's Leonardo da Vinci airport. But since the Italian government ordered a nationwide lockdown to stop the spread of COVID-19, the area is practically deserted. For one night, an Associated Press photographer accompanied fisherman Pasquale Di Bartolomeo and his two-man crew on their trawler, the Marianna. Their catch goes to the Silver Fish cooperative in Fiumicino for auction. Di Bartolomeo has been a fisherman for 42 years. Before the lockdown, he’d go out to sea five nights a week. But that has decreased to three nights because the cooperative has suffered a 30%-40% drop in demand. While supermarkets and fish shops can participate in the auctions, restaurants are closed during the lockdown, diminishing the demand for their catch. Di Bartolomeo said going out three times a week isn't enough to make a profit and the earnings hardly cover boat maintenance costs and his employees' salaries. The three fishermen work constantly through the night and into the daylight, pulling up their nets every two hours. They are full of fish, including bluefish, octopus, calamari, shrimp and the occasional angler. They select the fish, clean them and neatly put them in...
