Technical chart claims that Orange S.A. (ORAN) would settle between $12.02/share to $12.1/share level. However, if the stock price goes below the $11.78 mark, then the market for Orange S.A. becomes much weaker.

Vice versa is the case if the MACD is below the zero line.

Westerns can be introspective, too, you know. _The Assassination of Jesse James By the Coward Robert Ford_ is mostly about a man who idolizes the legendary Jesse James and wants to be a part of his outfit of outlaws, but then resents that the legend is just a man, and kills him in cold blood. Brad Pitt plays Jesse James, and Robert Ford is deftly played by Casey Affleck.

Witchcraft, in Natalie Rousseau’s mind, is too non-dogmatic and non- hierarchical to submit to a single all-encompassing definition. “As a practice, it’s so highly individual,” she says, “but across the board, it is very place-based, land-based and body-based. For me, it’s about cultivating a relationship with your own body, your own mind, your emotions, and subtle sensing faculties. It’s learning how to trust your intuition. It’s about reclaiming your own instincts, but also being able to feel: this is what stress feels like in my body, this is what relaxation feels like, this is what it feels like to say yes to something out of a sense of obligation or pressure, this is what it feels like to have a boundary. This is what it feels like when I’m safe. These cues come to us from our bodies. It has to be, for it to work well, otherwise, you’re always reaching outside yourself for another authority.”

It has been brought to my attention that some of our friends and neighbors here in town have questioned why Ensign Corporation continues to open its doors every day for our employees to come and do their normal work, in light of so many local and national stores and businesses closing their doors temporarily to stem the tide of the Covid-19 virus sweeping across the country.
 It is an element of Ensign’s corporate policy and context statement to be responsible citizens, but to some it may seem that continuing business as usual in these troubled times contradicts that stance, and I feel our good neighbors are entitled to an explanation for our actions.
 First, rest assured that we are intensely aware of the risks and hazards associated with the spread of Covid-19 as is everyone else, and we constantly monitor what is happening around us. We clean and sanitize and practice ‘social distancing.’ The health and safety of our employees is uppermost in our minds and plans, and they may freely self-isolate at home without company retribution any time they choose.

 The Bock Family Foundation, Inc. is making donations totaling $20,000 to several local area food pantries and child care centers.
 Located in Perry, The Bock Family Foundation, Inc. was established in 2002 by the Larry Bock and Barbara Bock Estates, and is a nonprofit supporting organization for the benefit of organizations operated for religious, charitable, scientific, literary or educational purposes in Dallas County.
 The Foundation wanted to do something to help people impacted by COVID-19 beyond the community grants made twice each year. Recognizing that food pantries and child care centers are vital to the well-being of their communities and are likely finding their resources stretched as the pandemic continues, the Board felt that this was a way that they could make an impact and provide assistance to a number of local residents.
 Donations of $3,000 each are being sent to the Good Samaritan Food Pantry in Adel, Dallas Center Food Pantry, Granger Food Pantry, Perry Area Food Pantry, Waukee Area Food Pantry and Cottage Pantry in Stuart. Donations of $1,000 each will be given to Acorns and Oaks Daycare and PRESBY Child Care Center, both in Perry, who continue to operate and allow parents to keep working.
 The Bock Family Foundation is pleased to be able to make these donations to support the local individuals impacted in Perry and their neighboring communities.
