After The Athletic's report went live, the MLB launched an official investigation, and the league was _very_ diligent, to say the least. Over the course of the months-long investigation, the league dug through the 2017, 2018, 2019 seasons, interviewed 60 witnesses and gathered over 76,000 emails.

In response to the embassy attack, President Donald Trump ordered an airstrike that killed top Iranian military commander Gen. Qassem Soleimani, which provoked an ineffectual missile salvo on a couple of U.S.-occupied military bases in Iraq. Just hours after those missiles were fired, Iran also (purportedly unintentionally) shot down a Ukrainian airline passenger jet, killing all 176 passengers and crew on board.

Wyndmere-Lidgerwood boys looked to be in control of Friday night’s basketball game against Region 1 rivals Milnor-North Sargent.
 The Warbirds held an 11-point lead early in the third quarter, but watched the Bulldogs charge back to force overtime, then win 64-62.
 How this happened was simple.
 “They sped us up and we can’t handle the ball. That’s the story of our year. We beat ourselves in practice. We throw the ball off the wall. We dribble off our foot in practice. That is what’s going to happen in a game — you play like you practice,” said Warbird coach Todd Hosford.

Imagine the sudden panic in some homes near the Pickering station, where people have lived comfortably for decades, confident in the safety record of Ontario's nuclear fleet. How many packed the kids and pets in the car and hit the road at 7:30 Sunday morning, without waiting for more word on what actually had happened? How long should they have waited, with no more official information coming, before evacuating?

There were reportedly 63 Canadians on board the Ukrainian passenger jet that took off from Tehran and was shot down by an Iranian missile within minutes.

Complications also arose with an "SCTV" reunion directed by Martin Scorsese and co-produced by Netflix filmed a year and a half ago. The special event was put on the back burner as the U.S. streaming giant prioritized the acclaimed filmmaker's $160-million production "The Irishman."
 "Yeah, we're waiting on uncle Martin Scorsese," Lennox says with a smirk.
 With homegrown Crave originals there's a little more control over the process. "Letterkenny" didn't secure a stateside distribution deal until its fifth season, but its hoser cast became a cult hit in Canada, eventually leading Hulu to grab the U.S. rights. Crave hopes to duplicate that success with "New Eden," an eight-episode mockumentary on a feminist cult that debuted earlier this month.
 Brahm Eiley, president of Toronto's Convergence Research Group, says he's confident in how Crave has dealt with its U.S. rivals using a "block and tackle" strategy to buy the rights of Hollywood content while judiciously investing in a small number of new productions.
 "It's not as though Crave is lacking for original content at the end of the day," he says.
 "But on the original programming side they would have to up their spending tremendously," he adds. "Or they would have to get really lucky" with Canadian-made hits.
 Lennox says he's "very happy" with the level of content that Crave is buying and making at this point. They've signed a pact with Warner Bros. for a supply of TV shows that'll debut on incoming streaming platform HBO Max when it rolls out in May.
 "What you're doing is you're keeping it trim and in shape," he says.
 "Because there's just way too much."

_" It's positive to see 2020 begin with a surge in job applications, however we have seen an overall year-on-year decline in the number of job postings at the start of the year. The logistics and transport sector for example has seen a large decrease in postings possibly reflecting greater efficiencies in the sector from technological developments. Meanwhile, other sectors have seen increases, such as education where there was a 10% rise in postings in the first seven days of the new year." __" It remains to be seen whether stability provided by the election result, will seep into hiring decisions in businesses across the UK and whether we will see an overall uptick in job opportunities in the market in 2020."_ _" Regardless, a large number of workers are still re-evaluating their career paths after the Christmas break and may look to make the switch to a more fulfilling and rewarding job. But before looking at any new opportunities, jobseekers need to determine the working environment they desire, the sector they want to work in and the type of boss that will push them to succeed. This will help workers on the path to loving Mondays again in 2020."_
