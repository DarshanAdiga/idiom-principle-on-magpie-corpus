"That does not wash well in my book, I don't think it washes well with anyone and I do expect the public service to provide fearless and frank advice but accurate advice because I rely on that advice and the public relies on that advice."

OEMs and Captives must retain the innovative mindset and capabilities of the start-ups in their portfolio. Furthermore, the start-ups’ products and services need to generate enough value for the Captives and OEM to benefit from the partnership in the long term. However, significant differences in structure, size, pace of innovation, and organizational maturity can lead to inefficiencies in the collaboration and thus, it comes to impairments in scaling up the value and innovative strength of the start-up portfolio.

Certain skills and capabilities are crucial not only for a business to survive, but also for it to grow. As the company is becoming more mature, jobs often change from very broad-scaled jobs to more specialized ones. This change can also bring a shift in needed skillsets and capabilities. Knowing the capabilities, a company’s needs and getting the right people on board is a challenging task for smaller companies.

Another concession stand change is the ability for customers to use credit cards when paying for their food. While for this first Friday cash or check is still the way to go, the event soon will be able to take credit cards, Mundorf said.
 However, there’s another good reason for bringing some cash: the door prize drawings. Before the movie starts, tickets for the drawings can be purchased. Kids’ tickets cost 50 cents each and tickets for those ages 13 and older cost $1 each.
 The movie will be paused partway through, the lights will come on and drawings for door prizes will be held. While there aren’t as many door prizes as past years, there were many businesses that were generous despite the trying times and there is a good number of items to be won, Mundorf said.
 Along with bringing camp chairs for seating while watching the film — the outdoor event area covers 39,000 square feet, so there’s plenty of room to spread out — those who come will need to bring masks to wear while not eating and warm clothes and blankets to keep off the high-altitude cool that comes when the sun goes down, Mundorf said.
