"Of course, with 511 windows in the building, you can well imagine that there are substantial savings to be had by cutting corners in what you were installing," he said at the June 22 meeting.
 The board learned then that the windows have become brittle and are falling apart and the facilities committee recommended giving a four-phase, four-year project for $937,400 to Granite State Glass to do the replacement work, but the board balked at the request. Instead, members voted 6-1 (Joe Mosca in the minority) to send the proposal back, get draft specifications for the project and put it out to bid.
 The facilities committee had hoped to start the project last summer but after it was sent back to the drawing board, Mosca told the board in July that the project might cost $1.5 million by doing the work in installments.
 Since then, the committee has been working with Gale Associates Inc. of Bedford, a “building enclosure specialist,” according to its website, to come up with a new window replacement plan.
 The board got a report from the committee at their Dec. 14 meeting.
 According to facilities committee member Randy Davison, who also sits on the school board, Gale Associates offered a price cost of $1.3 million for the project, but urged the board to hire a professional estimator, who could supply a more concrete figure.
 According to fellow committee member Jim Hill, director of administrative services for the district, Gale said the cost of hiring an estimator would be around $2,000.
 Hill shared a recommendation from the committee — which also includes Superintendent Kevin Richard, Grigel and school board member Courtney Burke — to have the job done over a two-summer period.
 “By the time the bids come in and the windows are ordered, it's going to be late summer, early fall to do areas that could be cordoned off from students and staff," Hill said. "The following summer, the summer of 2022, would be July and August when no students or staff were in the building."
 He said Gale Associates had suggested "that if we wanted to get a better cost estimate on the cost of the windows ... they could provide us with a proposal from a professional estimating firm which they did."
 Davison said hiring the estimator would give the board a preliminary figure to put on the warrant, which could be replaced after bid requests are submitted later this winter. Hill agreed.

Bloomberg) -- The U.S. Navy’s plan to deliver the first vessel in its $128 billion next-generation submarine program on time is at risk by a dependence on inexperienced contractors with spotty quality control track records, according to a congressional watchdog.
 The Government Accountability Office, in a restricted Nov. 6 report to the Pentagon and congressional defense committees, said the design contract for the first vessel in the Columbia-class sub fleet being built by General Dynamics Corp. could have a cost overrun of as much as 14%, or $384 million.
 The initial vessel in the new class of nuclear-missile-carrying subs, the Navy’s highest-priority program, is due for delivery in 2027. The Navy wants the first submarine to launch on patrol in 2030.
 Yet that timeline “hinges on timely and quality materials from” an “atrophied supplier base” as General Dynamics and it top subcontractor, Huntington Ingalls Industries Inc., face “risk of delays from critical suppliers that are not yet ready to support construction,” according to the 73-page report obtained by Bloomberg News and marked “For Official Use Only.”
 The GAO report outlines in detail the myriad challenges facing contractors and the Navy in the design and construction of a 12-vessel program that advocates say is most survivable leg of the U.S. nuclear triad, comprising land, air and sea-based warheads.
 Trump’s 5-Year Budget Plan for Navy Would Add 82 New Vessels (2)
 As an example, the report says that General Dynamics “continues to identify problems with non-destructive testing and welding across the supplier base, including suppliers responsible for piping, valves and large mechanical equipment.”
 More broadly, the report signals the difficulties the Navy will face in trying to carry out the Trump administration’s vision for a 355-to-500 vessel fleet by 2045, up from 297 today.
 Those difficulties will be one of the first defense-procurement challenges confronting the Biden administration when it takes office next month amid a U.S. economy hobbled by the Covid-19 pandemic. The Columbia’s five-year plan envisions $30 billion being spent on the program through 2026, increasing from $4.7 billion planned for next year to $8.2 billion in 2026.
 But first, several quality-control issues have to be addressed.
 As the program enters formal construction and lead contractor General Dynamics prepares to award new subcontracts, “many suppliers have readiness and quality problems,” according to the GAO report. “Of their top 25 suppliers, the shipbuilders assessed 18 as not yet ready to support construction demand, not meeting quality expectations or both.”
 Pentagon $696B Agreement Boosts Lockheed F-35s, Boeing Chinooks
 Nevertheless, “the shipbuilders plan to spend $4.2 billion on materials from these 18 suppliers out of an estimated $5.5 billion” projected for all 25 firms. They will supply “complex machinery, raw materials and electrical components, among other things,” GAO said.
 Many of those contracts are sole-source for specific parts, GAO said.
 Both General Dynamics and Huntington face the supply and contractor issues laid out in the report, in part, because they are simultaneously building Virginia-class attack submarines “at a schedule and pace unmatched since” the Cold War ended, the GAO said.
 The Columbia class is designed to be the nation’s newest nuclear patrol submarine for deterrence efforts; the Virginia class is designed to attack land and sea targets and gather intelligence.
 General Dynamics spokeswoman Elizabeth Power said the GAO’s conclusions don’t reflect current progress and that “the vast majority of our critical suppliers are assessed as ready to support construction demand and to meet quality expectations.”
 The report’s findings may have influenced lawmakers on the House and Senate defense appropriations panels. A compromise report released Monday with the $696 billion fiscal 2021 spending package said that despite “significant” legislative support for the program, “challenges have occurred in certain design, prototyping, and advance construction efforts of the program.”
 The lawmakers also criticized the Navy for underfunding Columbia industrial base improvements.
 According to shipbuilder and Navy documents, the majority of skilled workers at the three primary submarine shipyards have less than five years experience and the majority of supervisors have less than five years experience. About 15% of the supervisors at General Dynamics’ Groton, Connecticut facility have five to nine years experience. That figure drops to about 5% at Quonset Point, Rhode Island, according to the GAO.
 Fragile Base
 Congress, the Navy and Columbia contractors recognize that a fragile industry base is among the program’s top challenges and made a concerted effort to bolster its capabilities, GAO said.
 Since 2017 “the Navy, with strong congressional support, has invested over $573 million in shoring up existing sources and development of new suppliers to help ensure the industrial base has the capability and capacity to meet the needs of the nuclear shipbuilding enterprise,” the Naval Sea Systems Command said in a statement.
 “The Navy will continue to work with the shipbuilder to reduce the risk with use of targeted investments, continued oversight, management processes, and metrics,” the command said.
 General Dynamics “has been actively engaged in supplier development and readiness throughout the last several years” and worked with suppliers this year “to build on earlier initiatives to optimize their readiness and performance to support Columbia construction,” Power said.
 Still, in spite of the companies’ efforts to improve subcontractor readiness, “the overall percentage of suppliers that are ready to meet demand has yet to improve,” GAO wrote.

Bloomberg Opinion) -- “Work from home” and lockdowns have carved up the real- estate sector into a handful of winners and many more losers. The resulting split into the good, the bad and the ugly presents a challenge for investors who expect diverging valuations to revert to historic averages in 2021.
 As the pandemic took hold, investors hoovered up shares in warehouses and logistics centers that facilitate the socially distanced economy. Mall owners were abandoned. Between the two extremes, offices suffered, but not as much as feared.
 Many workers in finance, law and professional services adapted to remote working. Their firms’ revenues proved surprisingly resilient. That’s meant haggling over the rent hasn’t been a top priority.
 Still, the Sunday atmosphere that persists in financial centers during the working week makes it hard to be overly optimistic for offices just yet. Real- estate stocks focused on London offices have fallen by about a third, and they trade close to a 25% discount to their most recent reported net asset value. A discount below 20% would be more usual, so the valuations anticipate office values will fall further, but not collapse.
 The new strain of Covid identified in the U.K. has reinstated tougher lockdowns and closed restaurants and non-essential stores again. That makes it harder for mall operators to vacate the ugly spot on the podium. The curbs will immediately turn off tenants’ income and hit rent collections.
 Even with the U.K. and Europe embarking on Covid-19 vaccine campaigns, mall owners such as Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield — owner of the popular Westfield sites — and Hammerson Plc trade at discounts of about 50%-80% of NAV. That too anticipates further asset writedowns — savage ones.
 How might these valuations revert back to real estates’ historic low double- digit (or smaller) discounts to NAV? Either share prices must adjust, or underlying values must move — or a mixture of both. It’s hard to assess what might happen because there are two big unknowns.
 One is whether people will simply head back to the office when the pandemic is under control. The longer governments have pushed a WFH-where-possible policy, the more expectations have risen that flexible arrangements will stick. Some corporate tenants are already seeking less space, to turn homeworking into a cost cut. Still, the savings aren’t huge as a percentage of total staff expenses, and some employers will probably see a drop in the person-per- square-foot ratio as good for morale. Frustratingly for investors, long leases mean the picture will remain fuzzy for a while.
 The other uncertainty is the sustainable level of rents in retail and leisure. The pandemic forced shoppers online, diners to takeaways and fitness fanatics to home gyms. Existing trends rapidly accelerated. The resumption of office working would support city centers, but malls have a harder job preventing the online journey becoming one way. Their owners face the cost of making locations more attractive while servicing high debts. But if vaccines truly bring back some semblance of normal life, an indication of where consumer habits are settling could emerge in 2021.
 It’s easier to see rents and values of offices and retail premises getting worse before they get better. But expectations for these sectors are low already. Indeed, “safe haven” logistics properties could lose some appeal if investors buy back into malls and offices, Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Susan Munden points out. Such a rotation could gain pace if investment strategists are right in predicting investors will shy from from chasing pricey growth stocks next year and buy equities that look cheap and are exposed to a recovery.
 The gap between share prices and actual property values will narrow eventually. But with the virus becoming more menacing, and vaccine distribution slow, equity investors’ pessimism is going to be hard to turn.

 Consistency is something Los Angeles Rams coach Sean McVay always emphasizes.
 They've found it, but not in the way McVay wants.
 The Rams head into a critical NFC West game at Seattle on Sunday having won their past four games against teams with winning records. They have also lost three straight against teams with losing records, including a defeat to the previously-winless New York Jets last week that leaves them with no margin for error if the Rams want to claim a division title.
 "To get to where we are trying to get to, you know, and get to the playoffs and play to win it all, we got to be more consistent as a team overall," defensive tackle Aaron Donald said Thursday. "That's on all of us from offense to defense to special teams."
 If they win their final two games against Seattle and Arizona, the Rams (9-5) would be assured their third division title in four seasons with McVay in charge because they would have swept the season series against the Seahawks (10-4). To get it, they will have to play much better than they did in the sleepy 23-20 loss to the Jets.

PALM BEACH
 After tossing a grenade that threatens to blow up a massive COVID relief and government funding bill and force a government shutdown in the midst of a pandemic, President Donald Trump spent his Christmas Eve golfing in Florida.
 Failure to agree on the bill could deny checks to millions of Americans on the brink.
 Trump had no events on his public schedule on the first day of his winter vacation Thursday, but traveled to his Palm Beach golf club, where he was spotted by CNN cameras on the links. Reporters were given no details of his schedule for the day, but told that, "As the Holiday season approaches, President Trump will continue to work tirelessly for the American People. His schedule includes many meetings and calls."
 Trump's departure came as Washington was still reeling over his surprise, eleventh-hour demand that an end-of-year spending bill that congressional leaders spent months negotiating give most Americans $2,000 COVID relief checks -- far more than the $600 members of his own party had agreed to. The idea was swiftly rejected by House Republicans during a rare Christmas Eve session, leaving the proposal in limbo.
 The bipartisan compromise had been considered a done deal and had won sweeping approval in the House and Senate this week after the White House assured GOP leaders that Trump supported it. If Trump refuses to sign the deal, which is attached to a $1.4 trillion government funding bill, it will force a federal government shutdown, in addition to delaying aid checks and halting unemployment benefits and eviction protections in the midst of the most dire stretch of the pandemic.
 It was a final raised middle finger to Republicans from a president who has been raging over his Nov. 3 loss to President-elect Joe Biden and trying to come up with new, increasingly outrageous schemes to try to overturn the results of a Democratic election. He has been egged on by allies like his lawyer, former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani, who accompanied the president to Florida aboard Air Force One.
 Trump's ire has been focused, in part, on Republicans in Congress whom he believes have been insufficiently supportive of his quest to delegitimize Biden's win by lobbing unfounded claims of mass voter fraud before Congress meets to tally the Electoral College votes on Jan. 6.
 In Florida, Trump continued to rail against the results, complaining to members that he had been robbed of the election and voicing frustrations about the year-end spending bill.
 "At a meeting in Florida today, everyone was asking why aren't the Republicans up in arms & fighting over the fact that the Democrats stole the rigged presidential election?" Trump tweeted after he'd returned to his private Mar- a-Lago club. "Especially in the Senate, they said, where you helped 8 Senators win their races."
 "I will NEVER FORGET!" he wrote in another,
 The statements underscored concerns that Trump is blowing up negotiations to punish lawmakers for what he sees as their insufficient support loyalty.
 Trump has provided no credible evidence to support his election claims, which have also been refuted by a long list of officials, from former Attorney General William Barr to Republican governors, judges and local election administrators.
 Meanwhile, the nation continues to reel as the coronavirus spreads, with record infections and hospitalizations and more than 327,000 now dead. And millions are now facing the prospect of spending the holidays alone or struggling to make ends meet without adequate income, food or shelter thanks to the pandemic's economic toll.
 To mark the holiday, the president and first lady Melania Trump tweeted out a pre-recorded video message in which they wished Americans a Merry Christmas and thanked first responders and members of the military.
 "As you know, this Christmas is different than years past," said Mrs. Trump, who focused on the acts of "kindness and courage" the pandemic had inspired .
 Trump hailed the vaccine doses now being delivered and thanked those responsible. "It is a truly a Christmas miracle," he said.
 Meanwhile, Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin have been trying to salvage the year-end legislation to try to prevent a shutdown. Democrats will recall House lawmakers to Washington for a vote Monday on Trump's $2,000 proposal, though it would likely die in the GOP- controlled Senate. They are also considering a Monday vote on a stop-gap measure to at least avert a federal shutdown and keep the government running until Biden is inaugurated Jan. 20.
 In addition to the relief checks, the COVID bill that passed would establish a temporary $300 per week supplemental jobless benefit, provide a new round of subsidies for hard-hit businesses, restaurants and theaters and money for schools, and provide money for health care providers and to help with COVID vaccine distribution.

The Portsmouth Daily Chronicle reported that the sleighing could not have been better on Christmas Day, with up to 8 inches of snow on a solid foundation of ice.
 By late morning, not a sleigh or a sled could be found for rent in that town, nor a horse to pull it. Even old ladies were out, noted the Chronicle, and "fast young men" with enough coin to hire a rig had no trouble finding the companionship of "young ladies of a corresponding rate of speed."
 Stable keepers made a tidy profit that day. So did purveyors of liquor, despite lingering restrictions from an early prohibition attempt. Numerous Portsmouth citizens imbibed a little too freely — to stave off the cold, of course — and some reportedly "disgraced themselves and their families."
 Outdoor winter frolic predominated on Dec. 25, except for Catholics and Episcopalians, who went to church Christmas morning; in the afternoon, they played, too.
 Skating was the favorite activity, especially among the young. One newspaper commentator found it heartwarming how solicitous older boys were about the safety of girls out skating for the first time that year, whose hands they persistently clasped, to keep them from falling
 So popular was Christmas Day skating that it led to occasional tragedy in warmer winters.
 December of 1862 turned mild, leaving the ice "neither smooth nor safe," but that failed to deter a population in dire need of some cheer nearly two years into the war. Imprudent exuberance drowned at least one skater that year and occasioned several close calls.
 Nineteenth-century holiday traditions included Christmas trees and the giving of gifts, but without the excess that became so common in the 20th century. For the laboring classes, the tree would usually not be found in the home but in the local church, where parishioners would gather on Christmas Eve.
 The gifts were almost always for the younger children, consisting usually of mere tokens or modest amusements light enough to hang from a branch of the tree — a pasteboard doll or a wooden whistle. An elder would pick each present from the tree and call the name of the child for whom it was meant.
 Families with greater resources carried that tradition home. Eastman Johnson, an artist who was born in Lovell, Maine, and grew up in Fryeburg, painted a wealthy New Yorker relaxing at home with his family just before Christmas in 1863, and a Christmas tree stands in one corner. The tree was not yet decorated or adorned with gifts, an activity that probably was reserved for Christmas Eve, even in posh homes such as this one.
 In some churches, the raising and trimming of the tree waited until Christmas night. In 1863, several Portland, Maine, churches and Sunday schools drew crowds with announcements that trees would be brought in and laden with gifts for general distribution at 7 p.m. on Dec. 25. Speakers on subjects spiritual, moral and military followed, and the evening closed with singing.
 Most children had come to expect little presents at home, too, for which they would hang a spare stocking from the fireplace mantle on the night before Christmas, as Clement Moore's poem had suggested. Elizabeth Blair Lee, the wife of an admiral and the sister of Abraham Lincoln's postmaster general, had a late-life child on whom she lavished so many presents that he began to measure the holiday by the loot. He was 6 years old on Christmas morning in 1862, when he arose before daylight, lighting a candle to inspect his haul. His many toys included a wind-up steam locomotive with tender and passenger cars, and a pair of ice skates that he couldn't really use in the Washington climate, but he voted that year "the best Christmas yet."
 Farther north, in his New York City home opposite Gramercy Park, Wall Street lawyer and investor George Templeton Strong restrained his children from "the beatific vision of their presents" until after breakfast on Christmas Day. Once released, however, they "made the middle parlor a bedlam for an hour." In families that considered themselves lucky to have one parlor, let alone three, one gift per child was more customary.
 By December of 1862, newspapers were beginning to notice that holiday "presentation," or gift-giving, was growing in popularity between adults, as well — at least among those of means. Some retail merchants were already promoting specific wares as Christmas gifts before the war began, generally for children but also with some ideas for adults. In the North, that expanded as the war progressed, but the trend quickly petered out in the South, with inventory and customers both in short supply.
 Granite State native Benjamin French, the commissioner of public buildings in Washington under Lincoln, received two silver decanter labels from his wife for Christmas in 1861. He doesn't appear to have reciprocated, but the next year he bought his wife a sewing machine and a diamond ring, as though to compensate, while she gave him some books.
 Government employees in the Confederacy could afford no such extravagance. John Beauchamp Jones, who worked in the War Department in Richmond, had to sell a silver watch in 1862 to buy his family Christmas dinner. They had a Christmas tree in 1863, but it was not "burdened" with gifts. Boys in both capitals — including Lincoln's sons, once — would usually explode "Chinese crackers" out on the street or fire off blank volleys from toy pistols.
 Army recruiting occasionally improved holiday sales. The draft deadline of Dec. 31, 1863, had inspired towns to vote hefty bounties for volunteers who enlisted against the town quota, and many men pocketed a windfall before going off to war. If they didn't spend some of it on Christmas gifts and groceries for their families, their wives might do so after they left.

Bloomberg) -- Billionaire Hui Ka Yan’s soccer club plans to delist from the nation’s over-the-counter market after Covid-19 hit revenue, dealing a further blow to the property mogul.
 Guangzhou Evergrande Taobao Football Club Co., majority owned by China Evergrande Group’s main property unit onshore, said in a filing that a delisting will help the company adopt a new strategy and focus on its main business, without further elaborating. The company recorded four straight years of losses since its 2015 listing, and business suffered another setback in the first half of this year following the pandemic.
 The soccer team, hailed for including China’s marquee players, is one of many non-property businesses backed by Evergrande, China’s second-largest residential developer. Once a highly sought after business, bolstered by President Xi Jinping’s interest in the sport, the team attracted the backing of billionaire Jack Ma’s Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.
 Hui spared no resources, hiring World Cup-champion coach Marcello Lippi. Guangzhou Evergrande became the first Chinese team to win the Asian Champions League, the local equivalent of Europe’s most prestigious tournament.

 The soccer operation joins a wave of companies delisting from the National Equities Exchange and Quotations, which is China’s biggest over-the-counter market but has little trading volume.
 Hengda Real Estate Group, which holds Evergrande’s main property assets in China, holds 57% stake in the club. Alibaba has a 38% stake.
 It’s unclear how much the delisting will cost. Guangzhou Evergrande offered to purchase shares for 40 yuan apiece, it said in a separate filing. The proposal is waiting for approval from its extraordinary shareholder meeting.

Greetings from the North Conway Community Center. We wrapped up a successful round of youth basketball mini sessions and are looking forward to starting a full season of basketball along with a new youth Nordic ski program after the holiday break.
 Starting the week of Jan. 11, we will host both basketball and Nordic ski programs after school. Our basketball programs will continue to take place once a week here at the North Conway Community Center. Athletes in grades kindergarten through second grade will continue to enjoy Saturday sessions for six weeks. Athletes in grades third to sixth will enjoy five weeks of fun skills and drills before the February break, followed by two weeks of scrimmages and other fun opportunities following the February break.
 Our indoor youth sports programs have a number of safety measures in place to keep our athletes, volunteers, and community safe. All athletes and coaches undergo a health screening before participating. Everyone is required to wear a mask throughout practice. We have increased our sanitation procedures and have made hand sanitizer available in multiple places. Go to northconwaycommunitycenter.org/youth-sports to register.
