TUI προσφέρει σε όσους έχουν κλείσει διακοπές στην Ισπανία τη δυνατότητα να αλλάξουν την κράτησή τους και να κάνουν διακοπές στα Κανάρια Νησιά, δηλαδή στη μόνη περιοχή της χώρας που δεν θεωρείται ζώνη υψηλού κινδύνου. Είναι και αυτό μία λύση; "Εδώ νομίζω ότι υπάρχει και ένα ζήτημα προσωπικής ευθύνης", τονίζει η Σαμπίνε Τσίμερμαν. "Όταν κάποιος κάνει διακοπές στο εξωτερικό, πρέπει να έχει ένα plan B και πρέπει να έχει σκεφτεί: Πώς θα επιστρέψω; Τι με περιμένει με τα τεστ και την ενδεχόμενη καραντίνα; Πώς μπορώ να προφυλάξω τον εαυτό μου;"

Burlingame officials admired plans to rebuild a defunct historic downtown site into a mixed-use development with housing proposed over space reserved for businesses.
 The Burlingame Planning Commission universally recommended the City Council approve plans to redevelop the former Gates House site at 1214 Donnelly Ave., during a meeting Monday, Aug. 10.
 The decision caps a yearslong process for planning officials who were initially critical of designs which have evolved to a point where the project will now go before councilmembers for final approval.
 “Overall, I think this is a great project,” said Commissioner Sandy Comaroto.
 Plans call for 14 units to be spread in the top two floors of the development over a ground floor, where 5,000 square feet will be reserved for businesses. Of the residential units, 12 will be two-bedroom units and two will be one- bedroom units. The development is slated to offer 23 parking spaces.
 During the conversation, some commissioners took some issue with minor details of the plans such as exterior features of the building or landscaping elements along the property boundaries.
 But the recommended, specific amendments are a far cry from the harsh critiques the project faced in 2018 when officials said the original designs looked like they belonged in an amusement park.
 “It looks like Disneyland to me, and Burlingame is decidedly not Disneyland,” said Commissioner Will Loftis during the meeting Tuesday, Oct. 9, 2018.
 But with the evolved designs, Commissioner Michael Gaul said he appreciated the new look.
 “I want to see it move forward. I like where it is,” he said, while suggesting it could perhaps use more architectural features in areas he considered a little too bland.
 Previously, the site was occupied by the home constructed in 1900 by the city’s first stationmaster G.W. Gates until it was demolished in 2018, following a 2013 four-alarm fire.
 The damaged building sat vacant after the blaze that was started by the floor heater in a neighboring building. The fire’s toll was clear from the charred exterior, visible behind a fence downtown.
 Estimates suggested the property sustained nearly $250,000 worth of damage in the fire. A city report claimed the demolition was necessary as the vacant structure was becoming a public safety threat and a harbor of illicit and illegal activity by trespassers.
 Gates, also the city’s third postmaster, commissioned to construct the building on Burlingame Avenue around 1900. He then had the house moved to its current location on Donnelly Avenue in 1917. It was deemed to be a historical building, eligible for listing on the local and national registers, around 2008.
 To recognize its place in the city’s history, some community members had asked that a plaque be placed at the new development.
 Looking ahead, Commission Chair Audrey Tse said she believed the new development will be an asset to the neighborhood.
 “I’m very excited to see this built,” she said.
 Councilmembers will make a final determination on approving the plans because it is part of the downtown corridor.
 In other business at the meeting, officials also blessed minor refinements to a three-story residential development proposed to feature seven condominiums at 21 Park Road.
 The project was previously approved by officials, who called for specific improvements to details around the windows and other minor elements. With the approval, the plans may move ahead to construction.

The U.S.-brokered diplomatic deal between the UAE and Israel has not gone down well with Muslim organisations, which have been espousing the Palestinian cause for years.
 Most of them, however, are guarded in their response about the peace accord, which they believe, will impact geopolitics in West Asia. “Already some Muslim nations have hailed the treaty. The deal was inked under the influence of the United States,” E. T. Mohammed Basheer, MP, national organising secretary of the Indian Union Muslim League, said.
 He said that the Palestinians had already slammed the decision of the UAE to normalise ties with Israel. “It must be noted that India was the first non- Arab country to recognise the Palestine authority,” he said.
 Shaikh Muhammad Karakunnu, secretary, Jamaat-e-Islami Hind, Kerala chapter, said that the UAE was forced to succumb to the interests of U.S. imperialism.
 “The decision to recognise Israel is dangerous for Palestine. More Arab countries may follow suit. However, the Palestine cause will be lost. The Palestinians who have been deprived of citizenship have become refugees in their own land, ” he said, adding that his organisation would hold discussions on the development in the coming days.
 Kerala Naduvathul Mujahideen ( KNM) president T.P. Abdulla Koya Madani felt that Palestine- Israel conflict had been an international issue for long. But now nations have started taking an individualistic stand for their own national interests. “No religious attribution can be attached to the deal. However, some undercurrents can be seen as its timing has come on the eve of the U.S. Presidential elections,” he said.
 Social critic Hameed Chendamangaloor said that Muslim organisations in the State would have to dilute their declared anti- Israeli stand.
 “Most organisations have been vociferously opposing the Israeli occupation of the West Bank since 1967. Now the Sunni majority nations appeared to be divided on the extraordinary deal. But they are opposed to Iran more than Israel. At the same time Turkey and Qatar are also supporting the Muslim Brotherhood. Even the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation is divided on the newly reached accord,” he said.
 Prof. Chendamangaloor also said that anti-Israeli stand of Muslim organisations in the State would not continue with their Palestine propaganda so as not to disturb their relationship with Arab nations especially Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Oman. Many organisations secure funds from these nations for their activities,” he said, adding that radical outfits also received funds from Iran, Qatar, and Turkey as well.

Lee was expected to play a key role as a reserve, but with his choice to sit out the season, the Patriots needed a bit more depth and experience at the position. That would have seemingly given Adeboyejo a better shot at sticking. However, with his injury, he has given way to a youth movement of sorts.
 Guys like N'Keal Harry and Jakobi Myers were locks to make the team as both could be the future at wideout for the Patriots. Veteran Julian Edelman is the most-known commodity, and Mohamed Sanu looks healthy and ready to perform well in a crucial contract year. The Patriots have a slew of rookie wide receivers brought in as undrafted free agents.
 Jeff Thomas, Will Hastings, and Isaiah Zuber will all compete for a spot on the 53-man roster or the practice squad during the 2020 training camp. Perhaps in a handful of weeks, Adeboyejo will get the call and opportunity to hop back on board with the Patriots.

Arizona may have won, but Game 3 was an assault by the Avalanche against the Coyotes. Colorado outshot Arizona, 51 to 23. The shot attempts were 73-30. Arizona did a good job at limiting the quality of the chances against them, but the ice was certainly tilted in this contest.
 The talent disparity between these teams is drastic: The Avalanche have arguably the best or second best first line in the league with Nathan MacKinnon, Mikko Rantanen and Gabriel Landeskog. They have the likely Calder Trophy winner on defense in Cale Makar. Their lineup is littered with solid depth players like Nazem Kadri and Andre Burakovsky.
 Arizona has some solid pieces but the depth throughout the lineup is something they can only dream of.
 Colorado has had the better of play throughout the series, dominating at times, but it still feels like the Avs haven’t reached their top level and their loss on Saturday could serve as a wake-up call.
 In addition, Darcy Kuemper cannot keep facing 40 shots every night. Eventually, he will lay an egg. Kuemper is a very good goalie, but he’s faced at least 40 shots in five of his last seven games. This is a recipe for a disaster.
 Colorado averaged 3.37 goals per game in the regular season which was good for fourth in the league. In this series, they’ve only scored eight goals in three games, well below their average.
 The sample size is obviously small, but they aren’t putting the puck in the net at their normal pace and it’s only a matter of time if they put up 40 shots a night.
 I think Colorado wins this game, but I’m not laying -195 on the moneyline. I think the Avalanche offense finally breaks through in this game and should be able to beat Kuemper a few times.

CHARLES TOWN — The Jefferson County Museum has conserved two rare 19th century documents: an 1882 marriage certificate for an African American couple, Alicis Hart and Philips Lucas, from Kearneysville and an 1800 first-edition printed copy of George Washington’s will.
 Cleveland Conservation of Art on Paper, Inc., repaired, cleaned and restored the two documents. The Calamara Fund of the Eastern West Virginia Community Foundation paid for the work.
 The beautifully restored marriage certificate is rare because of its embedded tintypes of the bride and groom and its decorative coloring. Few marriage certificates from the 1880s have tintypes; even fewer have tintypes of an African American couple. Dr. Shelley Murphy, a relative of the Hart family, donated the certificate to the museum.
 The copy of George Washington’s will is one of fewer than five thought to have survived from the first printing. Cornelia Helbold Haden Brewer, a sixth- generation descendant of Charles Washington, donated the will to the museum after it had been in the family for generations.

We noticed that the Polish teams facing Legia were pressing them high up the pitch and with Legia’s quality on the ball, they found it easy to work the ball quickly to expose the opposition and score goals at ease. Unfortunately for us, that is exactly what we did in our league and what made us so successful. We didn’t allow defenders to have time on the ball and more often than not, we won the ball back and kept possession comfortably. Could we do the same and go toe-to-toe with Legia Warsaw? The answer was no. So the decision was to drop deep and allow Legia to have the ball up until the halfway line and then we would press as a unit.

I hope you can forgive my not acknowledging last Monday, Aug. 10, as National Spoil Your Dog Day. My excuse, hopefully acceptable, is that my dog Lola, the world’s most perfect pup (my column, my rules) believes every day is National Spoil Your Dog Day, taking the wind out of the official pronouncement by the organization National Today. That group actually names a total of 78 animal- related holidays. Among those, we should note that today, Aug. 17, is National Black Cat Appreciation Day.
 Black cats’ association with witches and Satan dates back to the Middle Ages, a superstition which led to mass killings of these animals centuries ago and ignorant fears which sadly survive even to today (Animal shelter workers will tell you that black cats are among the hardest to adopt). Most people seem to be aware of the sad history of black cat’s association with bad luck and evil, but few know that these negative connotations are far from universal. Black cats carry many meanings in traditional belief systems, in fact, and none of this is (forgive me again!) simply “black and white.”
 Traditional beliefs about black cats also include that they attract suitors to women intent on marriage in parts of Japan and bring good luck to the newly married couple in the English Midlands. A black cat at your doorstep is a sign of prosperity coming your way in Scotland’s folklore. Eighteenth century pirates believed that a black cat walking toward you brings bad luck, while one walking away takes bad luck from you. Pirates reportedly also believed that that a black cat getting on board a ship meant it was surely destined to sink, while non-piratey sailors were convinced that a black cat on board was guarantee of a safe voyage. Ancient Egyptians held a special place for all cats, but black ones were held in the highest esteem since they resembled Bastet, the cat-headed god of home, health and fertility.
 Cats are great. Black cats are simply great animals with a recessive gene that suppresses the more typical tabby pattern. It’s a bit more common among males than females, and many also have quite amazing golden eyes. The rest is all our own nonsense.

“We live in a state that was designed to be a white utopia, and it is truly something remarkable for Portland currently to be at the center of the nation’s attention for Black Lives Matter,” said Cameron Whitten, founder of the Black Resilience Fund, which has raised $1.5 million this summer to invest in the Black community. “I could disagree with how they're doing it, but in the end, they’re putting their bodies on the line to protect me — and that is huge compared to what we’re used to.”

CHARLESTON — I shoehorned education issues and COVID-19 into the end of my column last week, but I’d be remiss in not diving into this contentious issue a bit more in light of recent union comments and last week’s West Virginia Board of Education meeting.
 I received some pushback last week, and by pushback, I mean one email saying “how dare you,” for comparing the work grocery and daycare employees have done in dealing with groups of people to teachers returning to the classroom next month.

Some of you might be thinking you love your crafts, and that’s OK, but is that catchall room organized enough you easily can sit down and start crafting? Or are you spending a lot of time looking for the items you need so you can craft? If that is the case, then a little organization will go a long way. My goal when I work with clients is to make their space organized enough they quickly can spend their time doing what they love and not spend it trying to find the supplies they need.
 First off, you need to decide what you want this room to be. So, my reader was motivated to make it into a guest room because she knew her mother-in-law would use it and enjoy it. Once you have determined what your goal is, next you need to attack it.
 Go through everything in the room and ask yourself these questions about the items, and be honest with your answers — do you need, use and love the item in question? If the answer is yes to all three parts of the question, then that’s a keeper, and you need to designate a pile for items you plan to keep and use in your catchall room.

Shashank Khaitan and Varun Dhawan had announced their third film together back in January this year. The duo, who have earlier collaborated on Humpty Sharma Ki Dulhania (2017) and Badrinth Ki Dulhania (2017), had made the decision to shelve the film even before the ongoing pandemic.\"As per our original plan, we were supposed to start filming on March 13. The delay was announced on March 15. So the stalling of our film was a blessing in disguise; otherwise, we would have ended up spending a lot more on the pre-production,\" Khaitan told Mid Day.Mr. Lele is the second movie the duo have decided to set aside due to the COVID-19 situation, the first being Ranbhoomi. Rumours suggested that the delay is due to Varun Dhawan’s busy work schedule. Janhvi Kapoor is also rumored to be a part of the film.Asked about the delay, Shashank said, “We were not able to form a flow for the shoot. It was a small film that is based in Mumbai, but things were not falling in place. I kept feeling that something is not right. Since Karan [Johar], Varun and I collectively felt it, we decided to hold off the project for the time being.”The poster was shared in January by Karan Johar. The film, which is being produced by Dharma Productions, was initially given a release date of January 1, 2021.

The net result of all these years of growth is that the App Store has become too big a part of Apple’s identity to give up now. Apple may fancy itself a Hollywood savant with Apple TV Plus or a creative haven with Apple Arcade, but the core business is much simpler. Apple sells iPhones, and then it makes App Store money from the free-to-play games and subscription services that run on those iPhones. And as iPhone growth has slowed, the importance of that second business has only grown. There may come a time when Apple’s other subscription offerings are able to carry the company forward, but it’s not today.

“It's a trucker love song,” Peck describes, with a laugh. The track, he explains, was written while on a national tour following the March 2019 release of his debut album, _Pony_. The somber, self-produced breakout collection featured the up-tempo “Turn to Hate” and the hypnotic “Dead of Night.” His lyrics wove decadent tales of outlaws and outsiders (smalltown drag performers, in the case of “Queen of the Rodeo”) while his spaghetti western-inspired visuals often incorporated arresting homoerotic imagery: His “Hope to Die” video referenced the sexually charged illustrations of Jim French and, in one still, Peck appears framed by another man’s bare calves as he purrs about two young bandits on the run. The collection felt at home amidst a greater cultural discourse that called into question the hallmarks of country music — who it’s for and who can make it — that emerged in response to the conflicted reception of Lil Nas X’s “Old Town Road,” which released around the same time. Its sleeper success propelled the singer from representation by the indie Sub Pop Records to a major label deal.
