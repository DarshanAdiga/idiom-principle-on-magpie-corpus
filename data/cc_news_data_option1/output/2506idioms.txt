Booth, the Ospreys’ new head coach, welcomed the new man to the region, saying: “Myself and Brock’s philosophy and how we want the Ospreys to play are very similar.
 “It’s about developing a homegrown team, playing an attractive brand of rugby and scoring tries.
 “We interviewed 10 candidates for the role and they were all highly qualified and impressive but we were really deliberate and methodical in the whole process to get the person we wanted.
 “And we appointed Brock because of his rugby CV and because of his vast experience of European competitions and northern hemisphere rugby. Why? Because that is where the Ospreys have to be competitive.
 “There is no doubt, in my mind, he will be an inspiration to the players he will be coaching because he has been a success as a player and will bring that same mindset as a coach.
 “His temperament and the position he played as a player very much go hand in hand and you can see him bringing those same qualities to his role as a coach. He is very calm, reads the game well and has an ability to think on his feet.
 “But the key factor for me in his appointment was that our approach to rugby is very much aligned and the vision and philosophy we have for the style of game we want to play was very similar.
 “We both want to play a positive, try-scoring brand of rugby and we both want to bring that to the Ospreys.”

Tennessee’s athletic budget for 2020-21 is based on the Volunteers having fans in the stands for the upcoming football season but still includes a $10.1 million cut in overall revenues. Randy Boyd, president of the University of Tennessee, said Friday reducing the number of fans further because of the coronavirus pandemic would have a “significant impact\" on the budget. “But we are financially prepared to withstand any significant problem,” Boyd said. The Tennessee Board of Trustees approved the athletics budget unanimously Friday along with the rest of the university's budget for the upcoming fiscal year. The Volunteers expect to collect and spend $129.5 million on athletics. That's down from the $139.6 million budgeted for the fiscal year ending Tuesday. Tennessee is projecting $29.8 million in revenue in ticket sales this upcoming season, which is a drop of 19.4%. That is $7.1 million less than the $37 million taken in during the 2019-20 season. John Compton, chairman of the UT Board of Trustees, said the university in position to handle the decrease, and then some — if needed. “If it were 30% or 40% or 50% lower, we would be able to handle it,” Compton said. Athletic director Phillip Fulmer has said Tennessee is planning on a full stadium this season and will adjust as needed. The Vols had been in line for a boost in attendance this season after averaging 74,870 fans per game in 2019. The Vols have the fifth-largest capacity in college football with Neyland Stadium holding 102,455 and are coming off a season where they won their last six games. They also are scheduled to host both Florida and Alabama — traditionally big draws — this season. Tennessee also hosts Charlotte, Furman and Troy. Tennessee plans to spend $10.5 million on travel in the...

MADISON, Wis. (WMTV) - The Madison Police Dept. launched a hate crime investigation after an 18-year-old reported being doused with lighter fluid and set alight while driving downtown Wednesday.The teen, Althea Bernstein, told investigators the attack occurred around 1 a.m. and she believes it happened when she stopped at an intersection. The victim said she heard some yell a racial epithet through her rolled-down driver’s side window.When Bernstein, who is biracial, looked over, she says she saw four white men, one of whom used a spray bottle to shoot liquid onto her face and neck. Someone then allegedly threw a flaming lighter at her setting the fluid ablaze.Bernstein told police she drove off, batting down the flames as she went. After getting home, her mother reportedly encouraged her to go to the hospital where she was treated for burns. A MPD spokesperson noted she will require follow-up treatment for the injuries.In a statement released following the attack, Bernstein’s family said they were “saddened by what happened to Althea and the unprovoked attack on her body.” They went on to ask for privacy as she recovers from the burns on her face and neck.Meanwhile, Madison Police Chief Vic Wahl told NBC15 News that no arrests have been made so far.“We have detectives assigned to the case, and are following up on it,” the chief said. “We have been in contact with the victim and we are going to do a thorough investigation and do everything we can to identify whoever was involved, and take the appropriate action when that time comes.”NBC15 News talked to two Madison residents about the incident.“I would say heartbreaking to see that. It could be anyone. My sister, my friend my mom,” said Dontae Vacklin.“We have to stop and think twice, like is someone going to attack me today?” said Daneia Gaddis.“You never know who’s next, That’s the scary part. We’re in America where they say everyone is equal but clearly we’re not treated as equal,” Gaddis said.Investigators have started reviewing surveillance cameras to see if the incident was captured on tape. Anyone with information about it is asked to contact Madison Area Crime Stoppers at 608-266-6014.Copyright 2020 WMTV via Gray Media Group, Inc. All rights reserved.

The pandemic may be the moment of truth. Genetic code vaccines — built with DNA or RNA — are strong front-runners in the global race to develop an immunization against the coronavirus that has claimed nearly half a million lives worldwide since it emerged in China seven months ago.

But in March, the company’s DNA vaccine for the coronavirus was featured on “60 Minutes.” And last week, the company snagged a $71 million government contract to manufacture the skin-zapping device that is part of its vaccine platform.
