E' quanto prevede l'ordinanza firmata dal presidente della Regione Lazio Nicola Zingaretti, relativamente alle misure di prevenzione per il Covid. La misura scatterà da domani a Roma alla stazione di arrivo dei pullman a Tiburtina.

 OTTAWA--Canada's chief public health officer says the federal government is in talks with the CFL about applying quarantine rules to returning American players that are similar to the cohort approach used by the NHL.
 Dr. Theresa Tam said Tuesday that protocols the NHL has in place, which includes the concept of teams entering quarantine together, is being discussed with the CFL, though she said she did not have an update on how far talks have progressed.
 The federal government approved a cohort quarantine approach for NHL teams entering Canada to resume the season in the hub cities of Edmonton and Toronto during the COVID-19 pandemic. The teams are isolated from the general public in "bubbles," and players can quarantine together instead of being subjected to the individual 14-day quarantine required of those crossing the international border.
 The CFL, which employs many American players who would need to cross the border, has approved Winnipeg as a hub city should a shortened 2020 season take place.
 Under the Manitoba government plan, CFL players and coaches would be in a bubble consisting of hotels, practice fields and a stadium. Players would have to isolate at home for 14 days prior to departing for Winnipeg, be tested for the novel coronavirus upon their arrival then go into quarantine for another seven days.
 A quarantine plan is not the only hurdle the CFL faces. The league needs to secure financial assistance from the federal government, and the CFL and CFL Players' Association need to come to terms on a new collective bargaining agreement, for a shortened season to get the green light.

The annual report card of Public Works Department (PWD) officials this year will rely heavily on how effectively they address waterlogging complaints under their jurisdiction during monsoon, said government sources.
 All executive engineers of the PWD have been directed to maintain a log book related to the resolution of waterlogging complaints, along with the image or video-based proof of their redressal, based on which entries will be made in their respective Annual Performance Appraisal Report (APAR), said government sources.
 A decision to this effect was issued following a meeting chaired by Chief Secretary Vijay Dev in regard to the PWD’s monsoon preparedness on July 20, the sources added.
 “In addition to coordinating with multiple agencies on the ground in regard to waterlogging complaints, the engineers have been directed to ensure the effective redressal of such complaints and non-performance will lead to the fixing of responsibility for them and contractual liabilities for private agencies engaged by the PWD,” said an official.
 “The supervising officials have been directed to maintain a proper log of identified points of stagnant water collection, steps taken for the redressal of such issues, the time taken to rectify the problem and the proof in the form of pictures or videos. These logs will be forwarded to the higher officers,” the official also said.
 According to the official, both good and bad measures taken by PWD officials in regard to waterlogging complaints will be part of their annual performance report, and it will be elevated to the department’s principal secretary.
 The PWD has jurisdiction over the largest length of drainage in the city at 2,064.08 km. This translates into a total of 1,037 drains under the jurisdiction of the PWD divided in separate zones of which the highest number, 466, fall under the North Zone followed by 314 under the East Zone and 257 under the South Zone.
 “Both, the appreciation of good work as well as lapses will be recorded in the APARs; responsibility will be fixed against the officials in either case. The objective is to ensure the most efficient redressal of waterlogging complaints,” the official said.

DETROIT – A body cam video of an officer-involved shooting that resulted in the death of a suspect in a drive-by shooting has been released to the public.
 The video released by Detroit Police Department on Monday, July 27, shows the suspect carrying a firearm and pointing it multiple times at the officer who then fired one shot. The suspect died from the wound. This officer-involved shooting occurred on Thursday, July 23.
 One of the victims of the drive-by shooting died of their wounds after the suspect was killed by police.
 The suspect was attempting to flee police on foot after a 10-minute, high- speed pursuit that ended when the suspect vehicle crashed into a tree. In his attempt to flee, the suspect ran toward officers. One officer was attempting to take the suspect to the ground while he continued to point the weapon at the officer who fired the shot, the video shows.
 “[The officers] did just what we asked them to do, as they always do,” said Detroit Police Chief James Craig during the Monday press briefing and video release. “They clearly were putting themselves in harm’s way to try to resolve this matter before anybody else got hurt.”
 The suspect who died is believed to have been involved in drive-by shooting that injured four teens, ages 15, 15, 17 and 18, on July 19, Craig said. The 18-year-old died over the weekend, succumbing to gunshot wounds.
 Around 6:40 p.m. on July 19, the four teens were sitting in a parked, red Ford Explorer on the 10000 block of Meuse Street, Craig said. They were celebrating the birthday of one of the victims. They were seated in the vehicle when a green Dodge Challenger pulled up alongside the Explorer and suspect fired multiple shots that struck all four teens. Crime scene investigators recovered 11 shell casings.
 All four teens were transported to local hospitals. The 18-year-old died about a week later. The victim’s names have not been released.
 Craig described the shooting as “unprovoked, senseless violence.”
 On Thursday, Detroit police received information about a suspect in the case, which led to surveillance. The suspect was observed by police getting into a Mercury Grand Marquis occupied by two males. At that point, officers exited their vehicle and made initial contact, issuing commands to the suspect that were not followed. The driver of the Mercury then fled the scene with the suspect, initiating a 10-minute, high-speed chase.
 Throughout the chase, the Mercury traveled on sidewalks, went the wrong way on streets, struck and nearly crashed into several police vehicles. The vehicle pursuit ended when the driver of the Mercury made a left turn, lost control and crashed into a tree.
 After the crash, all three males immediately exited the vehicle and attempted to flee on foot, all running in different directions. Two of them were taken into custody after foot chases.
 The suspect in the drive-by shooting was the only one of them to exit the vehicle with a firearm in hand. In his attempt to flee, he ran into officers. In the seconds-long encounter, the suspect pointed the weapon at an officer multiple times. That officer fired one shot, and the suspect later died from the wound.
 Watch the body cam video of the encounter 16 minutes into the video below.

Webb claims Town instigated a three-year plan to stabilise first rather than speculate to go straight back up.
 "The agreement when I came in was a three-year plan," said Webb.
 "It wasn't to attack the Championship and invest heavily on ready-made players who might give us a chance to get back up. The plan was three years.
 "Year One was to maintain Championship status; there was no set position saying we had to finish in the top 10 or top six, for example - so that was one tick box achieved.
 "To bring through homegrown players from the Academy, and I think three made their debuts and another four around the age of 19 were all given opportunities as well (so that was another box ticked), giving us something to build upon for the future.
 "Reduce the playing budget in January (was another task set) with some of the players that had different ambitions, not to be at Huddersfield but to be at other clubs ie in the Premier League or Europe.

 The England midfielder, 27, had assumed greater responsibility for his younger siblings after his mother fell ill earlier in the season.
 His performances for United waned as a result and, speaking to the Daily Mail in December, he said had been "down and glum".
 Lingard revealed he had been told he was on his "last chance" by Manchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, following an incident on social media last summer.
 "I wasn't performing and he [Solskjaer] was on me all the time. He wanted more from me," he added.
 The midfielder was also reportedly the victim of verbal abuse, including a racial slur, as he boarded the team coach after the club's FA Cup win at Derby County's Pride Park in March.
 In his latest social media post, Lingard acknowledges the fans "frustrations" but says his "love for this club and everyone connected to it has never left me".
 "This team, this club is my family and I will continue to keep working harder than ever to help this team achieve its goals," he added.
 Lingard's only league goal came in the eighth minute of stoppage time in his side's crucial 2-0 win over Leicester City, which sealed third place and a Champions League qualification spot on the final day.

During the run-up to the trading deadline last season, Buffalo Bills general manager Brandon Beane recognized that while he had upgraded the wide receiver position during the offseason, there was still more to do.
 In free agent signees John Brown and Cole Beasley, Beane gave quarterback Josh Allen two solid veterans, but he was still lacking the proverbial No. 1 target, a player who would command constant double teams, which in turn would open things up for Brown, Beasley and tight end Dawson Knox.
 Vikings standout Stefon Diggs was one of the players Beane thought would be an ideal fit, so he kicked the tires to gauge Minnesota's interest in making a deal.
 "I think it was pretty open that we were snooping around midseason to make a trade for another receiver and we just couldn't find a deal that worked for us," Beane said. "And you know, Stefon was one that we had looked into at that point, along with some other guys. Minnesota was not willing to part with him."
 Fast forward to March when the Bills' need for a big-play home run hitter remained; only this time, the Vikings were willing to negotiate. It took Beane giving up his first-round pick (No. 22 overall) plus sixth- and seventh-round picks in the 2020 draft, and a 2021 fourth-rounder, to get the Vikings to bite.
 Once they did, the Bills instantly zoomed to near the top of the NFL in terms of the best three-man receiving units in the league.
 "I said it at the end-of-season press conference (in January following the playoff loss to Houston), I blamed myself as much as anybody," Beane said. "It's my job and my personnel staff's job to add weapons to help run Brian Daboll's offense, help our quarterback, help Sean (McDermott). And so one of the things that I thought we still needed was finding somebody opposite John Brown to pair with Cole Beasley."
 The No. 22 overall pick that he gave up turned into Diggs. And when it was already clear at draft time that this was going to be an unprecedented season due to the coronavirus, Beane knew that even without the benefit of offseason practice, Diggs would be able to come to Buffalo and quickly transition to his new team as opposed to the certain struggles any rookie receiver they may have picked.
 "I just felt like it was going to be really hard, unless I traded up really high, to find a guy that I know could walk in, day one," he said. "I just felt a proven commodity was worth this."
 Diggs provides deep threat for Bills
 And Diggs is certainly a proven commodity. Last year he led the NFL in yards receiving (635) on passes that went for gains of 20 yards or more. What that indicates is that Diggs wasn't hitting singles and doubles, he was ripping triples and home runs.
 He was targeted 29 times on those 20 yards-plus plays and caught 16, a reception percentage of 55.2 that ranked second only to Amari Cooper of Dallas (62.5). On those 16 catches, he averaged a phenomenal 39.6 yards, and his six touchdowns measured 45, 62, 51, 54, 11 and 21 yards, an average of 40.6 yards.
 Those deep ball receptions were also aided by Diggs' ability to gain yards after the catch via his speed and elusiveness. He averaged 5.0 YAC last year, which ranked sixth in the NFL among receivers who were targeted at least 90 times. By comparison, Cooper's YAC was 2.9.
 Imagine how dangerous Diggs could be if Allen can fix his accuracy on deep throws, something that has plagued him during his first two seasons. Allen ranks last in the league over the past two seasons in completion percentage on throws targeted 20 or more yards downfield.
 "At the end of the day, I think when you look at the production that Stefon has experienced over the course of his career, that speaks for itself, right?" said McDermott.
 Sure does. The 26-year-old, who was a fifth-round pick in 2015, had 365 catches for 4,623 yards and 30 touchdowns with Minnesota, starting 63 of the 70 games he played. He made a career-high 102 catches in 2018, then set a new career-high for yards with 1,130 in 2019.
 "He's certainly been awfully good to this point," McDermott said. "It's an opportunity for him to continue to grow. It's an opportunity for us to get a good football player that will help us win."
 According to Pro Football Focus, since the start of the 2016 season, no NFL receiver has been better at making contested catches than Diggs, who has done so 60.6% of the time. Thus, his addition prompted PFF to rank the Bills' receiver unit the fifth-best in the league going into 2020 behind Dallas, Tampa Bay, Atlanta and New Orleans.
 Diggs' arrival should benefit Brown, Beasley
 Allen, who worked briefly down in Florida with Diggs, can't wait to see how the dynamics of the passing game will be impacted by his arrival, particularly for Brown and Beasley.
 "I think this is going to give them an opportunity to have more chances to catch the ball," Allen said during an appearance on Sirius XM NFL Radio. "They had career years and everybody's talking about how the addition of Stefon Diggs will hurt their value. I think it's the other way around. John was a 1,000-yard receiver last year. Man-to-man, he's extremely tough to cover. Cole, on the inside, if you put a nickel on him, he's a tough cover in man-to- man."
 During a Zoom call with reporters, Allen recognized he now has the weapons to succeed, and it's on him to utilize them to their fullest extent.
 "I appreciate what Brandon Beane has been doing by putting these guys around me," said Allen. "Now it's up to us to go out on the field and execute and put the plan together."
