More than six months after she spoke to the press, Denise Bonfilio is still experiencing repercussions. The 62-year-old was halfway into a ten-year sentence at Coleman Federal Correctional Complex, in Florida, when, just before Christmas, inmates started displaying symptoms of Legionnaires’ disease, a type of pneumonia caused by bacteria in water systems. Even as women around her were getting sick, prison authorities did not inform inmates of the outbreak, Bonfilio told the _Prospect_. “Their initial reaction was to hide it from us, and so for weeks they did nothing to treat us or fix it,” she said. In late January, prison officials finally announced that there was indeed a Legionnaires’ outbreak. (The case is currently the subject of a _class action lawsuit_.)

Las webs de anuncios en los que los usuarios buscan a personas que les presten servicios suelen estar llenos de mensajes insólitos y de sorpresas. Prueba de ello es el que una pareja de Reino Unido mandó a la web de mudanzas Shift.Querían que alguien los ayudara en un traslado, pero entre las condiciones había una que llamaba la atención. La pareja es naturista, por lo que les gustaría que la persona que les ayude con la mudanza lo haga desnuda.Cuando recibieron la propuesta, los responsables de Shift les indicaron que debido a las "políticas de la web", no podían publicar el anuncio pero sí podían explicar su caso en el blog de la plataforma."La semana pasada recibimos una petición muy especial de una pareja naturista, una relacionada con sus ideologías y tradiciones (nos imaginamos que ya pueden ver de qué se trata)" se lee en el blog.En el post hay publicados algunos pantallazos del intercambio de mensajes que hubo entre la pareja y la plataforma. En la conversación, la pareja explica que se quieren mover a mediados de septiembre y que buscan a alguien que tenga una furgoneta para que los ayude a llevar cosas en un viaje de 80 kilómetros de Reading a Londres."Sé que todo suena normal, pero mi marido y yo somos nudistas, y nos gustaría que la persona que viniera a nuestra casa lo hiciera sin su ropa. Normalmente no esperamos que la gente siga nuestras tradiciones, pero ya que esta persona entraría dentro de nuestro hogar y estaría en contacto con nuestras pertenencias, nos sentiríamos más cómodos si pudiera imitar nuestras prácticas", puede leerse en el mensaje.Aunque desde Shift no pudieron cumplir con la petición de la pareja, hicieron un llamamiento a todas aquellas personas que se puedan sentir cómodas con lo que piden la pareja y han recordado que el matrimonio está dispuesto a pagar U$S 2.500 a la persona que les preste sus servicios.La Vanguardia.GML

Chrsiyah was enjoying a...Posted by WNDU on&nbsp;Monday, August 31, 2020After finding out a short time later that it was a seven-year-old girl, Ruehle says she was devastated.She says she is also heartbroken knowing that a young girl just trying to enjoy herself at a birthday party was on the receiving end of bullet that ended her life.“Most of all, why the little girl? It hits close to home because he is five,” Ruehle said, pointing to her son.“I have an eight- year-old. It’s so close to home that it’s just heartbreaking. She doesn’t even know what life is. She hasn’t even begun to start life. And now she does not get to experience more birthday parties, going to school, if we ever get to go back to school, playing with friends, becoming a teenager, getting married in life. She doesn’t get to do any of those now because her life was senselessly lost by somebody driving by and shooting,” Ruehle says.Many neighbors who spoke to 16 News Now off camera say they are heartbroken, shocked, and asking everyone in the community to put the guns down and to stop the violence before yet another child is lost in South Bend.Copyright 2020 WNDU.

The officials briefed reporters on the condition that they not be identified.
 The regulator is also easing requirements on pension plans by lifting the temporary freeze on portability and annuity transfers implemented months ago when markets went into a tailspin.
 The transfers are payments made to pension members when they leave a plan, such as when a worker is laid off.
 OSFI had concerns about the solvency of pension plans over March and April, and implemented a freeze on those transfers.
 Officials say that uncertainty in markets and by extension on solvency levels has declined, meaning the restrictions are no longer required.
 This report by The Canadian Press was first published Aug. 31, 2020.

In many cases, prison authorities have responded to increased scrutiny by making it more difficult for the press to illuminate the conditions and policies that have made more than two million incarcerated people so susceptible to the virus’s spread. Inmates have faced harsh disciplinary action for speaking to the media. But as cellmates die around them, many feel it’s worth the risk to inform the public of what’s taking place behind bars.

While borrowers with private student loans, who still must pay regardless of their financial situation, have struggled, private lenders have taken advantage of federal subsidies. Private student lending companies like CommonBond, Ascent Funding, LendKey Technologies, Tuition Options, and Climb Credit have all taken Paycheck Protection Program loans, according to publicly available data from the Small Business Administration. PPP applications also came fast and furious in the income share agreement (a financial agreement where a borrower agrees to pay back the student loan with a fixed share of their future income) and the alternative credit spaces. Leif, Vemo, and Mertize all received PPP loans.

CINCINNATI (FOX19) - A new text messaging scam has emerged where hackers use the recipient’s real name and direct the recipient to a potentially dangerous link.The text says, “We found a parcel from March owed to you. Kindly assume ownership and confirm for delivery here.”“The bad news is we see these giant data breaches all over the place. That information is sold from one hacker to another,” said FOX19 Tech Expert Dave Hatter. “They buy this stuff off the dark web, and they build these giant dossiers on people.”If the recipient clicks on the link, hackers can then do more than collect the recipient’s information.“The bad guys collect this, they sell it, and then they use it in social engineering attacks through phishing, through smishing and these text-based messages,” said Hatter. “In some cases, they’ll even make phone calls, and they have a lot of information about you so they can make the call seem more legitimate.”Hatter advises to delete the messages or ignore them and do not click the link.Anyone expecting a package and is nervous someone forgot to deliver it should contact the shipping company.Copyright 2020 WXIX.

Prison and jail authorities often undermine incarcerated people’s access to outside news—or even to what’s taking place behind bars—by withholding information about outbreaks. Kiara Yarbrough, who was held at Dallas County Jail, wrote in _an op-ed_ that jail officials did not tell them there had been a coronavirus case in the jail until several days after that inmate had been removed. “Jails lock down information tighter than they lock down inmates,” she wrote. Nineteen women in a 24-person tank tested positive, and at least three people died.

“They’re trying to somehow connect open-water aquaculture with the need for domestic food. But it just doesn’t make sense,” said Marianne Cufone, executive director of the Recirculating Farms Coalition, one of several environmental groups that oppose the move. “Why we’re seeing it during a pandemic, I don’t know, I’m shaking my head.”
 The executive order gives the nation’s regional fishery management councils, which regulate fisheries, six months to recommend “actions to reduce burdens on domestic fishing.” One of the order’s stated goals is “more effective permitting related to offshore aquaculture and additional streamlining of fishery regulations,” with ”the potential to revolutionize American seafood production.”
 The order aims to bring seafood production to the U.S. instead of keeping the nation dependent on other countries, said Paul Doremus, deputy assistant administrator for operations at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s National Marine Fisheries Service.
 “We’re a major seafood consuming country and we could be producing more of that seafood internally,” Doremus said. “That’s the driving force behind the executive order as a whole.”

A broken down sailing yacht with 74 migrants and two smugglers on board has safely reached a western Greek port after issuing a distress signal off the resort island of Zakynthos, Greek authorities said Monday.
 A coast guard statement said two Turkish nationals were arrested on suspicion of belonging to a criminal ring smuggling migrants into Europe.
 The passengers, who lacked identity papers, told Greek authorities they were from Syria, Afghanistan, Iran and Turkey. There were 48 men and 26 women on board. The vessel was believed to have been heading for Italy, but it wasn’t clear where it had sailed from.
 The yacht was located late Saturday, following a search and rescue operation that involved two coast guard boats and private pleasure boats. It was brought to the port of Katakolo in the southern Peloponnese region Sunday, and confiscated.
