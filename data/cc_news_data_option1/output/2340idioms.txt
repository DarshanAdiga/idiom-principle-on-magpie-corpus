These maritime incidents are examples of Chinese gray operations conducted against the Philippines. Gray zone operations are “actions in the sea that often blur the between military and non-military platforms, actions, and attribution for events, and are often, but not always, undertaken to advance China’s territorial claims.” They are conducted to keep Chinese aggression at sea below the level of actual naval operation and are performed hidden behind the cloak of deniability. These complicate the littoral states’ ability to effectively respond to China’s expansion in the South China Sea.

Has anybody else out there noticed President Donald J. Trump likes to brag, embellish and lie a lot? He loves to belittle his enemies and he enjoys berating his allies. His fantasy of making America great again is in reality a series of steps toward economic isolationism.


   


  In an attempt to act empathetic, The Donald says he will work to eliminate racism by ensuring a healthy economy and employment for all. What? Does anybody out there really believe this is how free market economics operates? He and his crew have allocated trillions to bail out his buddies and tossed chump change to some of the rest of us.


   


  That 1,200 bucks us peons got will be eaten away by inflation down the road, so essentially we'll gradually give all that back. We'll probably get another $1,200 or some form of temporary relief before the election and then hang on. It should be obvious. Wall Street is currently not directly connected to the everyday economy. Once the election is out of the way and those freebie trillions dry up, the stock market will actually reflect reality.


   


  What we have is a failure to communicate. What we have here is technically called state capitalism. When the government has to steer and fund the direction this country moves, how do we differ from those commies in Russia and China? In Russia, the guys behind the scenes pulling strings are referred to as the Kremlin Mafioso. Here we just call our movers and shakers Wall Street executives.


   


  In regard to Washington word games, you may have seen The Donald criticize Mitt Romney for marching in a Black Lives Matter rally. Behind the scenes, Mitt and The Donald are working together to dip their fingers into Social Security. They gotta pay the bills sooner or later so if they shuffle cash out of our pockets into their hands, consider that a partial plan to fund the current bailout.


   


  I know plenty of people who should know better but they just don't want to believe The Donald is not really working for them. If this all sounds too far- fetched, I suggest you cut this article out and write the date on it and throw it in a drawer. One year from now it'll make sense.


   


  The people at the helm in Washington act like they are in control as they steer this vessel along within the current. Their vision is obscured by dollar sign blinders so they don't have to see the waterfall dead ahead. The Donald's trade tariffs put billions into his hands but us consumers feel the consequences.


   


  He didn't handle the COVID-19 crisis very well, so this should be an indication he may have a problem dealing with a future catastrophe. What could be worse than the last three months? Maybe a chunk of ice about the size of Ohio will break off from the Antarctic ice sheet raising the oceans a foot or two. There's a great BBC video on YouTube regarding undersea ice cavitation there. I recommend it especially if you have a winter home in Miami or Charleston, S.C., or a hundred other major cities on the coasts.


   


  There has not been an underground nuclear weapons test here in America for 28 years but The Donald now intends this pointless saber rattling act to intimidate China.


   


  He walks like a witless gunslinger but he isn't packing any heat. He admires brutal dictators and would like to emulate their tactics but his generals reject his strategy. He acts like the world is his golf course but his putter just isn't long enough.


   


  In my opinion the Russia-gate trial was a total waste of time and effort. The Donald should not be impeached for doing pretty much what the Democrats have already done. He should be impeached because he is simply a bad actor. If a strong economy is his solution for racism, we are back to square one.

Lawmakers continue to monitor the Small Business Administration’s Paycheck Protection Program, and the House Small Business Committee is expected to review PPP and some of the challenges borrowers face. That hearing is scheduled for Wednesday, and credit union and bank groups alike have called for Congress to pass legislation that forgives PPP loans valued at $150,000 or less. Recent Fed data shows 16 credit unions received roughly $410 million from the Fed's Paycheck Protection Liquidity Facility.


  The Supreme Court could also rule on multiple matters this week pertaining to credit unions. Much of the industry will be watching closely to see if the court finally makes a decision regarding the leadership structure of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. That case, Seila Law v. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, could have long lasting implications for how regulators — and the federal government at large — are structured. The decision is expected sometime by the end of summer and a timeline breaking down the case in detail can be found here.


  The court released a historic decision on Monday that protects LGBTQ workers from sex discrimination. The groundbreaking ruling is a step forward for progress given that many LGBTQ consumers still face lending discrimination. Last year, Superbia Credit Union was granted a charter in Michigan to become the first credit union specifically chartered to serve LGBTQ members.


  Finally, Monday is the last day for credit unions to file comments on the National Credit Union Administration’s proposed guidance on credit union-bank purchases. Those deals came at a fast and furious pace in 2019, and while some new transactions continue to be announced, state regulators have shut some of those deals down and the pace has generally slowed as a result of the pandemic.

Christopher Nolan's upcoming spy movie Tenet is one of the first major movies to release in theaters (or cinemas) around the world when it arrives on July 31. Last week, that date was pushed back from an initial target of July 17, which didn't change at the start of the pandemic even while a lot of movies did (Inception will be re-released instead). Now, we might have an idea why.


  According to a New York Times report, Warner Bros was keen to postpone Tenet, while director Nolan was keen to go ahead with its initial release date. The report characterizes the stand-off as a 'fraught moment' for Warner Bros, since his movies like Interstellar, Inception and the Dark Knight trilogy have all been enormously successful for the studio.


  Tenet is enormously passionate about the theatrical experience, and in March he wrote an op-ed for the Washington Post about how theaters are 'a vital part of American social life'. "The combination of that pent-up demand and the promise of new movies could boost local economies and contribute billions to our national economy," Nolan said, describing what'll happen after the crisis passes. We'd speculate it's likely, then, that Nolan sees Tenet as a key part of the recovery of this industry.


  Really, though, Warner Bros made a sensible move. While theaters from major chains like AMC (which owns Odeon in the UK) plan to start reopening in July, regional plans may vary. New York City, for example, might not reopen in time for the new Tenet release date, according to Variety. Movie theaters have started opening again in California, though.


  Our guess is that Warner and Nolan see Tenet as an ideal movie to kickstart the industry again, giving people a clear reason to go to theaters after almost three months without any movies on the big screen. Tenet looks like it's cultivating a similar 'mystery box' marketing tactic to Inception, where you're incentivized to see it because you want to know what the secret is behind all the strange imagery you're seeing in the trailers.  

  That could be a powerful draw to get people watching movies again.


  ## Tenet isn't first, though


  The situation around theaters reopening is likely to remain unpredictable for the time being, depending on where you are, and how badly hit your home is by the global pandemic.


  Tenet isn't the first movie to come to theaters post-lockdown. Instead, Disney's live-action version of Mulan will start to roll out on July 24.


  Russell Crowe effort Unhinged also rolls out a little earlier on July 10.

  “Our philosophy of putting members at the forefront, is why our members continue to entrust us with their savings,” he said. “We put our members first in everything we do and this results in the confidence of our membership. It is this loyalty that allows us to continue to grow and better serve the community.”


  Vibe CU serves 67,000 members across 16 branches. According to first-quarter call report data from the National Credit Union Administration, Vibe had more than $825,000 in net income during the first three months of the year, a stark drop from the $10.2 million it posted for the first three months of 2019. That drop is attributable in part to an uptick in charge-offs and a drop in recoveries, increased compensation and office expenses, and a substantial decline in noninterest income, though much of the gains in the first quarter of 2019 were one-time results due to the merger.

GENEVA (AP) — African nations have prepared a draft resolution at the U.N.’s top human rights body that singles out the United States and would launch intense international scrutiny of systemic racism against people of African descent in the wake of recent high-profile killings of blacks by American police.


  The draft text, a copy of which has been obtained by The Associated Press, could become the centerpiece for an urgent debate hastily scheduled for Wednesday for the Geneva-based Human Rights Council.


  It calls for a Commission of Inquiry — the rights body’s most powerful tool to inspect human rights violations — to look into “systemic racism” and alleged violations of international human rights law and abuses against “Africans and of people of African descent in the United States of America and other parts of the world recently affected by law enforcement agencies" especially encounters that resulted in deaths.


  Such work would be carried out “with a view to bringing perpetrators to justice,” said the text, circulated by the Africa Group in the council. The breadth of support for the measure was not immediately clear.


  The U.S. mission in Geneva declined immediate comment on the draft resolution.


  President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of the 47-member body two years ago, accusing it of an anti-Israel bias and of accepting members from some autocratic governments that are serial rights violators.


  On Monday, the council agreed unanimously to hold the urgent debate on “racially inspired human rights violations, systemic racism, police brutality and the violence against peaceful protests” in the wake of the George Floyd killing in the United States.

We'll probably get another $1,200 or some form of temporary relief before the election and then hang on. It should be obvious. Wall Street is currently not directly connected to the everyday economy. Once the election is out of the way and those freebie trillions dry up, the stock market will actually reflect reality.


  What we have is a failure to communicate. What we have here is technically called state capitalism. When the government has to steer and fund the direction this country moves, how do we differ from those commies in Russia and China? In Russia, the guys behind the scenes pulling strings are referred to as the Kremlin Mafioso. Here we just call our movers and shakers Wall Street executives.


  In regard to Washington word games, you may have seen The Donald criticize Mitt Romney for marching in a Black Lives Matter rally. Behind the scenes, Mitt and The Donald are working together to dip their fingers into Social Security. They gotta pay the bills sooner or later so if they shuffle cash out of our pockets into their hands, consider that a partial plan to fund the current bailout.


  I know plenty of people who should know better but they just don't want to believe The Donald is not really working for them. If this all sounds too far- fetched, I suggest you cut this article out and write the date on it and throw it in a drawer. One year from now it'll make sense.


  The people at the helm in Washington act like they are in control as they steer this vessel along within the current. Their vision is obscured by dollar sign blinders so they don't have to see the waterfall dead ahead. The Donald's trade tariffs put billions into his hands but us consumers feel the consequences.


  He didn't handle the COVID-19 crisis very well, so this should be an indication he may have a problem dealing with a future catastrophe. What could be worse than the last three months? Maybe a chunk of ice about the size of Ohio will break off from the Antarctic ice sheet raising the oceans a foot or two. There's a great BBC video on YouTube regarding undersea ice cavitation there. I recommend it especially if you have a winter home in Miami or Charleston, S.C., or a hundred other major cities on the coasts.


  There has not been an underground nuclear weapons test here in America for 28 years but The Donald now intends this pointless saber rattling act to intimidate China.


  He walks like a witless gunslinger but he isn't packing any heat. He admires brutal dictators and would like to emulate their tactics but his generals reject his strategy. He acts like the world is his golf course but his putter just isn't long enough.


  In my opinion the Russia-gate trial was a total waste of time and effort. The Donald should not be impeached for doing pretty much what the Democrats have already done. He should be impeached because he is simply a bad actor. If a strong economy is his solution for racism, we are back to square one.

The Confederate generals were not heroes, they were fighting to break apart our nation. In elementary and high school I learned the “Gone With the Wind” version of the Civil War, extolling the virtues of states’ rights. My teachers left out the fact that the “states’ right” being fought for was the institution of slavery.
 I did not allow my education to end at that level and have made an effort to begin to see the world through a different lens. I will never know what it is to be black in America, but I can acknowledge that we continue to struggle with the legacy of slavery and continuing discrimination based on the color of one’s skin. Removing symbols of the Confederacy from public places is a small step in the right direction. Working together to change discriminatory policies, laws and practices is the next big step.

Liverpool should get to work on a statue of Jurgen Klopp as soon as the Premier League title is secured, says club legend Steven Gerrard.


  The coronavirus pandemic forced the season to be suspended in March with Liverpool 25 points clear at the top and just two wins away from sealing top- flight success for the first time since 1990.


  The 2019-20 campaign will get back under way behind closed doors on Wednesday, with second-placed Manchester City taking on Arsenal in their game in hand.


  Defeat for Pep Guardiola's defending champions would offer Liverpool a chance to clinch the trophy against local rivals Everton at Goodison Park on Sunday.


  Bill Shankly won three league titles with the Reds, while Bob Paisley led the club to six top-flight triumphs and three European Cups. Both are immortalised in bronze outside Anfield.


  Former Liverpool captain Gerrard has no doubt the same honour awaits Klopp, who masterminded Champions League and Club World Cup triumphs last year.


  "Knowing Jurgen, he won't want to be put in that bracket. I know what he's like, he's humble and respectful," Gerrard told The Athletic. "When you look at the scale of the job he's done, for sure he deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as those iconic managers.


  "What you need to take into consideration is that when Jurgen took over Liverpool they weren't close to being the best team in the country, they weren't even in the top four.


  "To come to Liverpool when he did, get to the amount of finals that he has, deliver the sixth European Cup and then deliver the first league title after 30 years…


  "For me, someone like Jurgen should be rewarded now. It seems like in football we often wait until people get older before their achievements are fully recognised.


  "But I know the owners of Liverpool won't let that happen. When Jurgen delivers the league they should already be starting work on a statue of him."


  Gerrard describes Klopp as "the best manager in the world", and says his appreciation of the former Borussia Dortmund head coach has only deepened through personal experience of being a boss at Rangers.


  Gerrard won two FA Cups, three EFL Cups, a UEFA Cup and the Champions League during a 17-year career with Liverpool, but the Premier League title eluded him.


  However, seeing the team lift the trophy will make him "the proudest man on the planet".


  "You don't want to count your chickens until it's certain but I think we all know that it's inevitable," said Gerrard. "For me, there will be a lot of relief. Being a fan for a lot of those years and being a player and coming ever so close, you know that this is the one that people have craved."

Christopher Nolan's upcoming spy movie Tenet is one of the first major movies to release in theaters (or cinemas) around the world when it arrives on July 31. Last week, that date was pushed back from an initial target of July 17, which didn't change at the start of the pandemic even while a lot of movies did (Inception will be re-released instead). Now, we might have an idea why.


  According to a New York Times report, Warner Bros was keen to postpone Tenet, while director Nolan was keen to go ahead with its initial release date. The report characterizes the stand-off as a 'fraught moment' for Warner Bros, since his movies like Interstellar, Inception and the Dark Knight trilogy have all been enormously successful for the studio.


  Tenet is enormously passionate about the theatrical experience, and in March he wrote an op-ed for the Washington Post about how theaters are 'a vital part of American social life'. "The combination of that pent-up demand and the promise of new movies could boost local economies and contribute billions to our national economy," Nolan said, describing what'll happen after the crisis passes. We'd speculate it's likely, then, that Nolan sees Tenet as a key part of the recovery of this industry.


  Really, though, Warner Bros made a sensible move. While theaters from major chains like AMC (which owns Odeon in the UK) plan to start reopening in July, regional plans may vary. New York City, for example, might not reopen in time for the new Tenet release date, according to Variety. Movie theaters have started opening again in California, though.


  Our guess is that Warner and Nolan see Tenet as an ideal movie to kickstart the industry again, giving people a clear reason to go to theaters after almost three months without any movies on the big screen. Tenet looks like it's cultivating a similar 'mystery box' marketing tactic to Inception, where you're incentivized to see it because you want to know what the secret is behind all the strange imagery you're seeing in the trailers.  

  That could be a powerful draw to get people watching movies again.


  ## Tenet isn't first, though


  The situation around theaters reopening is likely to remain unpredictable for the time being, depending on where you are, and how badly hit your home is by the global pandemic.


  Tenet isn't the first movie to come to theaters post-lockdown. Instead, Disney's live-action version of Mulan will start to roll out on July 24.


  Russell Crowe effort Unhinged also rolls out a little earlier on July 10.
