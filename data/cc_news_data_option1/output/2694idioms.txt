Mr Grayling is among the MPs nominated for the ISC, but the committee's members will vote to decide who chairs it.
 Other MPs nominated to the body include Tories Sir John Hayes, Julian Lewis, Mark Pritchard and Theresa Villiers; Labour's Dame Diana Johnson and Kevan Jones, and the SNP's Stewart Hosie.
 MPs will be asked to approve a motion confirming the ISC's new membership on Monday, ahead of a similar procedure in the Lords on Tuesday.
 Ian Blackford, the SNP's Westminster leader said it was "shameful" that it had taken so long to re-form the committee.
 And he blasted the PM for trying to "parachute" an ally with a record of failure in a chair.
 He said: "The ISC is a Committee of Parliament established by statute and holds a pivotal role in scrutinising and overseeing the work of the UK’s security apparatus. Its impartiality from government is critical to its ability to function effectively.
 “It is then deeply concerning that the latest plan devised by Dominic Cummings and Boris Johnson will aim to parachute Chris Grayling as chair of the committee by putting forward favourable Tory members who will vote him through as chair.
 “The chair of the ISC has long been appointed by consensus and this move does nothing less than undermine the role of the ISC and breach its independence.
 “The likely nomination of Chris Grayling as chair - who has a distinct record in government as a jack of all trades and master of none - will deliver a blow to the effectiveness of the committee’s work.
 "The ISC must be able to hold the confidence of Parliament and get on with the job of properly overseeing key security matters and addressing the diverse threats facing the UK. This latest attack on government institutions from Cummings and Co. however marks yet another dangerous step."

As he ran, Killsalive felt like he was following in the footsteps of those who came before -- he just couldn't tell if it was his ancestors or his old man. His elders told him that he came from a defiant people, the Hunkpapa, one of the seven council fires of the Lakota. His great-great grandfather, Henry Kills Alive, whose last name he carries, was a scout for Sitting Bull. Henry rode with Sitting Bull during the Battle of the Little Bighorn, where the allied Lakota, Cheyenne and Arapaho annihilated George Armstrong Custer's Seventh Cavalry, sent by President Ulysses S. Grant to round up and confine the Indians to reservations. The Hunkpapa were among the last tribes to surrender and report to their reservation. On the run, Killsalive and the Standing Rock youth were told a Lakota prophecy that a Black Snake would slither across the land, desecrating sacred sites, poisoning water and destroying the earth itself. A new generation of Lakota would rise to stop the monster. In the Black Snake, Killsalive and the Standing Rock youth saw the Dakota Access Pipeline, and in the new generation of Lakota, they saw themselves. "I truly think everything we did was passed down," Killsalive told me. "All of us have a warrior spirit, a warrior heart. We don't know how to give up. We don't know how to bow down to nobody. That's why they called us the 'Great Sioux Nation.'" Soon they were calling themselves something else: "Black Snake Killaz."

Schools are crucial to communities in ways that go beyond basic learning. They also provide children with friends, food and other support systems. The American Academy of Pediatrics strongly supports children physically returning to classrooms.
 Schools are also a key part of getting the economy going, said David Rothschild, an economist at Microsoft Research.
 "It's what allows so many adults, especially people without much means, to get back to work," Rothschild said. "There's this huge downstream effect in the short run of getting people back into school, which you may not be able to say in the same sort of way for bars and restaurants."
 But if a community has a high level of infection, public health experts say reopening classrooms will be risky, even if schools try to require masks and follow social distancing guidelines.
 Hundreds of children and staff have been infected in COVID-19 outbreaks tied to graduation ceremonies and summer camps, including in Missouri, Texas, Louisiana, Georgia, North Carolina, Tennessee, New York and Florida. Organizers of at least one of the camps said they were following guidelines issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
 That's why it's so important, experts say, to consider the wider community and not think of schools as closed systems, unaffected by what the virus is doing outside their walls.
 Children are less likely to become seriously ill than adults, and there's not much evidence that children are driving transmission, said Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University's COVID-19 Testing Insights Initiative. Still, there is a risk they could transmit the virus to others, including teachers or vulnerable people they live with.
 "That is a reason to think about how to improve safety and to reduce the risk in school environments," Nuzzo said. "Those measures and the move to reopen schools should proceed before the higher risk environments" like bars, restaurants, gyms and other indoor spaces "where adults are packed together and they have a hard time social distancing."
 If transmission can be reduced in the wider community, she said, it will make it safer for schools to reconvene.
 "We should be prioritizing the reopening of those public spaces that have known benefits and low risks," Nuzzo said. "And we think that schools are one of those."
 Even before Trump's push this week, Democrats and public health experts were already talking about how important it is for children to return to classrooms.

LOS ANGELES (AP) — Authorities believe rising rapper Pop Smoke was shot and killed during a Los Angeles home-invasion robbery in February after his social media posts led five suspects to the house he was renting, police said after detectives arrested the group Thursday morning.Los Angeles police had initially discounted a robbery theory in the days after the 20-year-old rapper's death Feb. 19 at a home in the Hollywood Hills. Pop Smoke's legal name is Bashar Barakah Jackson.Capt. Jonathan Tippet, who oversees the Los Angeles Police Department's elite Robbery-Homicide Division, said three men and two teenage boys likely went to the home because they knew Pop Smoke was there from social media posts. They stole items from the home, though Tippet said he could not divulge what was taken. The teens were 15 and 17 years old."We believe that it was a robbery. Initially we didn't really have the evidence but then we discovered some other evidence that showed this was likely a home invasion gone bad," Tippet told The Associated Press on Thursday.The five suspects were arrested Thursday morning as detectives served several search warrants in Los Angeles. All are believed to be members of a South Los Angeles gang, which Tippet would not name, and at least some of them are believed to be linked to a 2019 homicide when a fight escalated into a shooting outside the Rose Bowl in Pasadena.Pop Smoke and his entourage staying at the home are not believed to be associated with the gang, Tippet said. No one else was shot during the incident. The Los Angeles Times reported in February that the rapper had posted pictures of him posing by an infinity pool in the home's backyard, as well as a picture of the Los Angeles skyline from what was likely the house's backyard. In another post, Pop Smoke or a member of his entourage put a picture of a gift bag tagged with the Hollywood Hills address and a different photo showed him posing by a Ranger Rover in a spot where the home's address was partly visible in the background. "It's our belief that (the home-invasion robbery) was based on some of the social media" posts, Tippet said. "It's based on the fact that he was posting his information may have contributed to him knowing where to find him."The home where the shooting occurred is owned by Edwin Arroyave and his wife Teddi Mellencamp, daughter of Rock &amp; Roll Hall-of-Famer John Mellencamp and a star of "The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills." Teddi Mellencamp previously said on Instagram that the couple had been notified of the shooting at their rental property but knew no more than what they had seen in media reports.Pop Smoke arrived on the rap scene in 2018 and broke out with "Welcome to the Party" a gangsta anthem with boasts about shootings, killings and drugs that became a huge sensation, and prompted Nicki Minaj to drop a verse on a remix.Earlier this year, Pop Smoke released the mixtape "Meet the Woo 2," which debuted at No. 7 on the Billboard Top 200 albums chart. It was the follow up to his first official release, "Meet the Woo." The rapper also had the popular hit "Gatti" with Travis Scott and Jackboys and "Dior."Last week, Pop Smoke released his posthumous debut album "Shoot for the Stars, Aim for the Moon," which was met with mostly positive reviews. The 19-track album featured several star-studded guests including 50 Cent, Roddy Rich, Future, Swae Lee, Quavo and others. ___Associated Press Writer Jonathan Landrum contributed.Copyright 2020 Associated Press.

 It joins Juneteenth, which showcases the talents of local African American artists, in the Main Gallery at the Bank of the Arts.
   
 The Director's Gallery show honors the late Martha Jenkins, a popular arts instructor at New Bern High School for 19 years, who died in 2005.
   
 Jon Burger, interim Arts Council director, said that the Martha Jenkins Scholarship Fund was later established and has been used to provide tuition assistance to art students from NBHS and currently ensures students access to gallery opportunities at Community Artist Gallery on Middle Street.
   
 Jenkins was a New Bern native who graduated from Meredith College in Raleigh. She returned to the area and became gallery coordinator for Craven Arts Council before becoming a teacher at her alma mater of New Bern High School in 1986.
   
 According to the arts council, "She believed the art program helped to teach students' self-esteem, discipline, creative thinking and gave them a solid basis to study art at the university level."
   
 After a five-year battle with cancer, Jenkins died on July 11, 2005. In her honor, the Twin Rivers Artists Association and her family organized the creation of the Martha Hall Jenkins Scholarship Fund, which was originally used to grant a $1,000 scholarship to a deserving New Bern High School senior who planned to study art.
   
 In 2019, Community Artists Gallery and Studios agreed to take over administration of the fund with the intent to provide gallery space for Craven County Art Students to exhibit their work in downtown New Bern.
   
 This Director's Gallery exhibition showcases pieces from Jenkins' 20-plus- years as an artist. It includes watercolors, ceramics and prints of her work.
   
 A concert by her son Stephen Jenkins had been planned to benefit the scholarship fund, but was canceled due to COVID-19 restrictions.
   
 These events were organized by her widower, Dan Jenkins.
   
 Creative Workforce and Juneteenth exhibitions were originally planned as separate shows, but due to the effects of COVID-19, they have been consolidated into one exhibition, according to Burger. A reception is planned, with safety precautions in place, including the statewide mask order.
   
 Juneteenth artists include Jarmon Fonville, Edna Stewart, Dion Burroughs, and Rakia Jackson.
   
 Creative Workforce expands on a 2018 exhibition that featured faculty from eight community colleges in Eastern North Carolina. It focuses on community college educators, their roles in teaching the next generation of artists and their own personal contributions to the field. It will also highlight the success and talent these instructors are able to achieve with limited resources, and importance of expanding those resources. Mediums include painting, textiles, sculpture, wood, and installation works. Colleges include Craven Community College, Rowan-Cabarrus Community College, Fayetteville Technical Community College and Pitt Community College.
   
 Admission to all galleries at Bank of the Arts is free and open to the public Tuesday through Saturday, from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.
   
 Also for ArtWalk, Community Artists Gallery, 309 Middle St., features "Wet and Wild" for its July theme, with featured artists Noreen Jekel, Sandy Bruno and Ann Marie Hodrick.
   
 Jekel is a painter, photographer and creates jewelry.
   
 Bruno is a painter using oil and watercolor. Her newest form of art is Pyrography - wood-burning art.
   
 Hodrick is a jewelry artist using high quality natural stones and organic elements.
   
 Visitors are also invited to tour the upstairs Studio Annex to see the latest works in progress. It is shared by local artists Joyce Straton, Susan Cheatham, Belinda Scheber, Brenda Gear and Heidi Lock.
   
 Community Artists Gallery is non-profit and cooperative, staffed by the participating artists. Call 633-3715 or go online at communityartistsgallery.org
   
 Also, Carolina Creations, 317A Pollock St., features Jean and Ann of Charlotte's Daughters Glass, along with Sweet Nanny Goat's Milk Soap.
   
 The Greater Good Gallery on Craven Street will not be open for ArtWalk, according to owner Lisa Bisbee-Lentz. She had a sale in June and is using the historic site for art classes during the summer. Those classes have also been postponed for two weeks.
   
 "No one is sick, I just want to be super careful," she said.

 Participants listed on the July ArtWalk card include Red Shoe Studio Gallery, Cow Cafe, Lee Hood Studio, Bella's Cafe, The Chelsea, The Brown Pelican, Living Well Down East, The Four C's, The Black Cat Shoppe, Hopeful Balance, Bear City Fudge Company, Balanced Hands & Bodywork, The Crystal Lady Gallery & Stained Glass Studio, Next Chapter Books & Art, Mitchell Hardware, Nautical Wheelers, The Accidental Artist, Blush Boutique, Morgan's Tavern & Grill, Prohibition Grill, Small Batch Graphics + Goods, Dirty Barn Vintage, Galley Stores & Marina and Weichert Realtors @ Rivers Edge.

“In 1984, I presided over a wedding ceremony in Eldama Ravine that Mzee Moi also attended. My sermon happened to have touched the President though he never mentioned it until two years later during the graduation ceremony of AIC Kenya pastors at Pwani Bible College,” he told a local daily.
 “After the ceremony, the president’s handlers came looking for me. I was shocked and I thought I must have said something that had offended him. I was taken to Mombasa State House where the President was waiting for me,” he was further quoted as having said.
 And with that Mr Yego’s was thrust into a new life and dined with the high and mighty. Although his reign at the helm of the AIC Church was not without controversy, Bishop Yego was a likeable man.
 In 2018, the High Court ended a decade-long battle with a breakaway group who had threatened to split the church into two factions.
 Then High Court judge Chacha Mwita ruled that a group led by an excommunicated member of the church, David Mbuvi, was illegal and Yego’s faction was then recognised by the Registrar of Societies.
 Even President Moi, who had immense influence in the church had failed in his quest to reconcile the warring members.
 According to court records, the leadership crisis began in 2007 when an election to appoint officials was conducted. Mr Mbuvi then claimed that he had won and went ahead to take over the leadership of the church.
 This led to the church conducting another election in 2008 where the its faithful confirmed Bishop Yego and the others as officials.
 But he made sure he had reconciled with the members before he handed over the reins to Abraham Mulwa.
 In interviews, Bishop Yego said Mr Moi would invite him to his Kabarak home for prayers after which they would tour his expansive farm. They were good friends and the former head of State would confide in him some of his plans, including his plan to name President Uhuru Kenyatta his successor in 2002.
 He said although former vice president Kalonzo Musyoka was his close friend, Mr Moi had told him not to pass the message (of naming Uhuru his successor) to Mr Kalonzo, who was then the Kanu national organising secretary.
 In February, while Kenyans mourned President Moi, Bishop Yego reminded them that Moi had publicly asked for forgiveness and, therefore, persons holding grudges against him were only hurting themselves.
 “President Moi personally apologised to those he had wronged and also forgave all those who had wronged him. He had no grudge. I am a witness and as a Christian, I believed him,” he said.
 All was well for the retired cleric until March this year when a loan he borrowed six years ago threatened to disrupt his retirement. He rushed to court, but failed to convince the judge to stop Transnational Bank from selling his property in Kileleshwa.
 According to Justice David Majanja, Bishop Yego admitted the indebtedness. And because of that, he cannot suffer loss that cannot be compensated by damages in case he succeeds in convincing the court that the bank was wrong.
 “According to the correspondence between the parties, the plaintiff has been in default since 2019. He has not met promise to settle the debt despite several offers by the bank to accept settlement,” Justice Majanja said when he dismissed his application seeking to restrain the bank from auctioning the property.
 Documents filed in court showed that Bishop Yego is a customer of the bank and in 2014, he borrowed a loan of Sh140 million from Transnational Bank.
 To secure the loan, he charged his property in Kileleshwa. His plan was to construct some 50 apartments on the parcel.
 However, he failed to service the loan forcing the lender to issue a warning. And when the warning was not heeded, the bank instructed Purple Royal Auctioneers to sell the property to recover the money, which stood at Sh143 million.
 But the retired Bishop challenged the planned auction saying the bank had undervalued the property and that the outstanding balance was Sh86 million not the Sh143 million as quoted by the lender.
 Bishop Yego also said the project he undertook fell into problems caused by third parties and arbitration proceedings commenced and was decided in his favour.
 However, he was yet to receive the arbitration award and had commenced the process of execution before the High Court through a separate suit.
 He said after falling into arrears, he approached the bank with a proposal on the repayments. Then, the bank had indicated that the amount owed was Sh116 million.
 Documents he filed in court showed that he made great effort and repaid Sh34 million, with the last instalment being made in January.
 The retired cleric also wanted the court to stop the planned sale arguing that a third party was willing to buy the property at Sh200 million but that the process was derailed in the wake of Covid-19, whose effects has sharply cut sales and reduced appetite for properties.
 Born at Lelmokwo, Nandi County, on January 1, 1950, Bishop Yego had, at his retirement, said he will dedicate his time to advocate for social justice and peaceful transition in various spheres in public life.

I am excited that Gaston County is taking a measured and thoughtful approach to the future of the statue in the front of the Gaston County courthouse.
   
 I value the opinions of all panel members and look forward to learning how Gaston County views its public buildings and what those buildings mean in the greater community.
   
 There are two verbs I will be looking for in the coming sessions, glorify and signify, and how these verbs reconcile with the permanence of our statue.
   
 The first verb is glorify, meaning to exalt or praise. Most people will recognize this word as the description on how we deliver praise or how we assign importance to someone or something.
   
 We glorify God or we glorify the act of charity, like donating to the Empty Stocking Fund.
   
 Statues can glorify someone or something. When a statue glorifies someone, it usually represents a larger than life figure who on the balance, deserves this honor.
   
 President Eisenhower may have had extramarital affairs, but his overwhelming contributions as a military leader and president should be glorified.
   
 The second verb is signify, meaning to represent or symbolize. Statues that signify something are often based on people or objects that hold special meaning.
   
 A statue of a dove might symbolize peace while a statue of an anonymous mill worker might symbolize the economic foundation of Gaston County. This is where the debate gets tricky because what a statue signifies can change greatly over time.
   
 While the Confederate statue in Gastonia may have originally intended to glorify courage and signify the southern spirit, anything associated with the confederacy is now problematic.
   
 The easy answer is to remove the statue. The harder answer is how one can reconcile the changes in our society.
   
 I propose that we leave the statue but add truthful language that explains the burden of southern history.
   
 In addition, rather than spending money to move or take down the statue, use those funds to construct new statues or monuments at the courthouse that better reflect civil rights.
   
 It's irresponsible to erase history but also irresponsible to do nothing about it.
   
 Jason R. Sanders is a resident of Gastonia.

 The killer refused to reveal where he was hiding but did give his date of birth to the call handler.
 "So at the end of the day, yous killed me and him before that trigger was ever pulled," claimed Moat as he continued to blame the police for his imprisonment.
 When the call handler said they were trying to help him, Moat snapped back that they were not.
 "You will get your chance to kill us, right, you will get your chance to kill us," he said, to which the call handler insisted they would not.
 "Yous wanted me to kill myself but I’m gonna give yous a chance cos I’m hunting for officers now."
 The worried caller on the other end pleaded with Moat that they did not want anymore killing, but he hung up the phone.

ASHEVILLE - As the state of North Carolina set a new record high for coronavirus hospitalizations July 7 so, too, did Mission Health.
   
 As of 7:30 a.m. that morning, there were 23 patients hospitalized with lab- confirmed COVID-19 in the system, and all of them were at Mission Health's flagship in Asheville, Mission Hospital.
   
 Through June, Mission Health -- which operates six hospitals in Western North Carolina as well as numerous clinics -- maintained an average of 15-20 hospitalizations due to the illness.
   
 "It's hard to know if this one point is going to signify an increase overall, a new average higher number," Mission Chief Medical Officer Dr. William Hathaway told the Citizen Times. "But we're obviously very concerned that it is, that it could represent that."
   
 Statewide, coronavirus hospitalizations were at 989, according to the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services. That's seven more than the previous day and the fifth straight day of record hospitalizations.
   
 Hathaway said neither Mission Health nor Mission Hospital are anywhere near capacity and that there are protocols in place for dealing with a surge in Western North Carolina, if one comes.
   
 But he stressed the importance of adhering to public health guidance, saying that, with a virus this contagious and with so many unknowns, "anything is possible."
   
 ICUs not at capacity, could be expanded
   
 In addition to the 23 lab-confirmed COVID-19 patients, there are 20 patients in-house in Mission Health hospitals who are awaiting test results for the virus. Of those, 15 are at Mission Hospital, three are at Blue Ridge Regional and two are at Transylvania Regional.
   
 An average of 3.6% of inpatient tests at Mission come back positive, according to system spokeswoman Nancy Lindell.
   
 At Mission Hospital, specifically, the majority of confirmed COVID-19 patients are isolated in a pulmonary unit. But an average of five to 10 patients with the illness have been in the intensive care unit over the past month, where they are also kept away from non-COVID-19 patients.
   
 On July 7, there were seven COVID-19 patients in the ICU. There are 91 designated ICU beds in Mission Hospital, but that number can increase significantly, if necessary.
   
 When the pandemic first hit, Buncombe moved quickly to implement social distancing restrictions ahead of the state and initially was able to flatten the curve of rising cases. Hathaway said this enabled Mission to learn from what other systems were experiencing nationwide.
   
 The system made plans to expand ICU capacity and create additional bed space ranging from 800 to 1,300, "depending on what the onslaught was," Hathaway said.
   
 Nonessential surgeries were halted and in-house hospital numbers plummeted, creating a wealth of open beds. The procedures have since been reinstated, but Hathaway said they could be stopped again, if necessary. Other restrictions could also be implemented.
   
 "We have never had to and we pray to God that we never will have to create new beds or expand beyond our normal capacity, but we're prepared to do that if we do have to," he said.
   
 Staffing an expanded bed capacity
   
 Bed availability is one thing and staffing is another, however.
   
 Hathaway said ICU nurses and others who tend to such patients are required to have a certain skill set, so "it's a blend of human capital and physical capital to be able to expand (capacity)."
   
 Asked if he thought there would be a need to increase staffing this month, Hathaway said he hopes not, but that there are protocols in place and that, in the case of a surge, they are prepared to employ traveling nurses, as well.
   
 He said he isn't worried, at this point. But he admitted that the unknown potential of coronavirus cases creates a wide range of possibilities. He stressed that people need to continue taking precautions seriously.
   
 "If we had an exponential rise like they have in other (states), where they've gone to Phase 3 or wide-opening the economy, opening bars, as an example, who knows what could happen?" he said. "That unknown gives me concern, but right now we're good, I think. We're OK where we are."
   
 Slow increase over several months
   
 Hathaway said Mission Health has been tracking COVID-19 cases on a daily basis since the first positive test at Mission Hospital was returned March 20.
   
 "I remember, early on, we were counting the cases," he said. "Every time there's a new case, I'd get a phone call. … They were so few and far between."
   
 For the first six to eight weeks, Hathaway said the inpatient numbers remained between two and six. A spike came in Buncombe when the virus began hitting nursing homes in May, and Mission Hospital saw an impact as infected staff members needed care.
   
 "At the very end of May, we saw a slight (uptick) in our in-house numbers, running between 15 and 20 on average," said Hathaway. "We were as low as 14 at the beginning of last week and then we had a bump up at the first of the week."
   
 Buncombe health officials have warned that, as the impact of COVID-19 continues to worsen in the nation and the state, "there remains the potential that cases will overwhelm our health care system in July."
   
 Hathaway said he doesn't think that's likely, "but it's possible." So far, he said, the numbers "look pretty good."
   
 'No one is completely invincible'
   
 Hathaway noted that, though Buncombe has seen an increase in overall cases, there has not been a significant spike in local hospitalizations.
   
 He suspects this is due, in part, to the fact that many new cases are occurring in young adults, who are at a lower risk of severe illness.
   
 He said this shouldn't "instill a false sense of security" that it's OK if those individuals get infected.
   
 "The more people who get it, the more likely it is that older folks and vulnerable folks would be affected and end up in the hospital," he said. "So, we have the responsibility to everybody to protect ourselves, even if our own risk is not that high from getting it. ... No one is completely invincible with respect to what can happen with this virus.
   
 "It distresses me personally to see the gatherings that we saw over the holiday weekend, the gatherings that we see in public places. ... We really need to be maximally attentive to trying not to get it and then not spreading."

In the Sunday Times, Robert Colvile argues that our Build Back Better campaign ‘conceals a back door to socialist revolution’. His piece kicks up as much dust as possible in an attempt to hide the fact that most people don’t want to go back to the old ‘normal’ of the pre-COVID era, the ‘normal’ that got us into this mess.
 So instead of tackling the ball Colvile goes for the player. The issue, as he valiantly unpicks how the Build Back Better campaign happened (next time just call Robert) is who did it, not why. The whole piece tries to reveal a ‘stitch up job’ of covert left-wing ops trying to sneakily bring down capitalism. Far from it.
 As one of the architects of the campaign let me quickly tell you how it happened before going on to the substance of what really matters and what Robert is trying to avoid.
 Back in April, a few people who knew each other from centre-left think tanks had a conversation about how we do indeed need to build back better. This probably isn’t a shock. The guiding thought was that this can’t be a left-wing conspiracy but had to be genuinely broad. That means compromise. We eventually found some words and asked people and organisations to sign up. There was no cloak and no dagger. Nothing was concealed. Everyone knew who was doing it and why.
 To try and infer that the heads of over 350 organisations were somehow duped into a left-wing plot is laughable. So laughable that Sky News ran the piece not as a cooked up conspiracy but as an important intervention about what happens after the crisis.
 The real subterfuge then comes not from Compass or the New Economics Foundation, but from Robert. Why go for the players? Because you don’t want to debate the issues, and the central issue is this; why when approached by two centre-left think tanks did 350 organisations, many of them household names, like the CBI and the Chambers of Commerce, agree to sign a statement that defined what ‘build back better’ means?
 And here is the nub of what they willingly and openly signed up to: how to ensure that the health, social care and other vital public services are properly resourced and able to meet our future needs; how to mend the inequalities in our society, so that everyone, no matter their background or race, can live a decent, fulfilling life; how to create secure, well-paid and rewarding jobs for all who want them, particularly for young people; and how not just to build our resilience to future pandemics, but to tackle the climate and environmental emergency already upon us.
 That’s it. A new common sense, not an anti-capitalist agenda – because we don’t have one.
 But it’s Robert who opts for smoke and mirrors as he tries to dodge the big issues. He knows this is a moment for the state to stand up and be counted. He knows it is a moment for collective action to come to the fore. He knows more than anything that this is a moment when even a Conservative government had to put the interests of people before the interests of profit.
 Robert knows all of this. And he is scared of it. So instead of making the case for rolling back the state, for free markets and for competition – all of which he knows are deeply unpopular because they are so deeply inappropriate in this moment of crisis and beyond – he invents a conspiracy.
 In all this, what he inadvertently does is shine a light on how we debate, learn and make big change happen.
 Conspiracies never work, at least not for long. There is no Leninist shortcut to force the march of history that ends up in a better society. But if you really want to change a society now, in the age of social media in which everyone is connected to everything, to every other person and idea, then your conspiracy is going to have to be an open one. The future will not be imposed, not by Robert, me or anyone, it will only be negotiated.
 And in this epochal moment of global pandemics, climate change, looming depression and the march of artificial intelligence – the change is going to have to be big and transformative. Nothing else will do.
 Build Back Better is an attempt to create alliances for change that mean we don’t simply slip back to the assumptions, ideas and policies that got us into this mess. Nothing more, nothing less.
 Robert should come out from behind his pay wall and debate the issues – tackle the ball – and tell us where he wants to kick it and why. This is an incredible moment to think big and differently. It is a moment to learn from different views and people you don’t necessarily agree with.
 Back in the early 1940s a young MP rose to his feet in the Commons and, against the backdrop of the Great Depression and the Second World War, coined the term and therefore the desire for ‘social security’. He was making the case to build back better. That MP was the Conservative Quentin Hogg, later Lord Hailsham. It helped pave the way for the social reforms that both Labour and Conservative administrations enshrined for decades to come.
 The creation of a better or good society is not the task of a couple of centre-left think tanks working in the shadows. It is the task of all of us. And that includes Robert Colvile.

The United States on Thursday took its first major action to stop "horrific" abuses against China's Uighurs and other Turkic Muslims, slapping sanctions on several senior officials.
 Three officials will be refused US visas and see any US-based assets frozen including Chen Quanguo, the Chinese Communist Party chief for the Xinjiang region and architect of Beijing's hardline policies against restive minorities.
 Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that the United States was acting against "horrific and systematic abuses" in the western region including forced labor, mass detention and involuntary population control.
 "The United States will not stand idly by as the CCP carries out human rights abuses targeting Uighurs, ethnic Kazakhs and members of other minority groups in Xinjiang," Pompeo said in a statement.
 The other two officials hit with the full sanctions were Wang Mingshan, the director of the Xinjiang Public Security Bureau, and Zhu Hailun, a former senior Communist leader in the region.
 The Treasury Department sanctions also make it a crime in the United States to conduct financial transactions with the three people as well as a fourth person, Huo Liujun, a former security official, who was not subjected to the separate visa restrictions.
 The Treasury Department also imposed sanctions on the security bureau as an institution, pointing to its sweeping digital surveillance of Uighurs and other minorities.
 Witnesses and human rights groups say that China has rounded up more than one million Uighurs and other Turkic Muslims in Xinjiang in a vast brainwashing campaign aimed at forcibly homogenizing minorities into the country's Han majority.
 Pompeo in a conference call with reporters Thursday called the situation "the stain of the century" and has previously drawn parallels with the Holocaust.
 China counters that it is providing education and vocational training in a bid to reduce the allure of Islamic radicalism, a threat it says it shares with the United States.
 The action comes amid soaring tension between the United States and China on a range of issues from trade to defense to the coronavirus pandemic.
 Pompeo in recent weeks has also announced visa restrictions on Chinese officials over the treatment of Tibet and Beijing's clampdown in Hong Kong -- but, in contrast, did not publicly name anyone affected.
 Activists say that visa restrictions can be effective by impacting officials' children, who will lose the prestige of heading across the Pacific for study or pleasure.
 \- 'At last, real consequences' -
 The Uighur Human Rights Project, an advocacy group, hailed the sanctions and urged other countries to follow suit.
 "At last, real consequences have begun. This comes at the 11th hour for Uighurs," said the group's executive director, Omer Kanat.
 Congress has led the push for a tougher response and in May passed an act that authorized sanctions, listing Chen by name, although Pompeo and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin took Thursday's actions under separate authorities.
 In a fresh effort, 78 members of Congress across party lines released a letter that urged President Donald Trump's administration to consider formally designating China's actions as genocide.
 They wrote the letter after a German researcher, Adrian Zenz, wrote that China has been forcibly sterilizing Uighur and other ethnic minority women.
 "Evidence of violence against Uighur women and coercive efforts to halt the growth of the Uighur population in (Xinjiang) require strong US leadership and international action," said the letter, whose signatories included Republican Senators Marco Rubio and Mitt Romney and the top Democrats on the foreign policy committees of the two chambers.
 Despite wide concern in Washington over treatment of the Uighurs, former national security advisor John Bolton in an explosive new book said he was shocked at Trump's attitude on the issue.
 Bolton wrote that Chinese President Xi Jinping explained the detention camps to Trump in a meeting and that the US leader replied that they were "exactly the right thing to do."

Leeds United moved to the brink of a return to the Premier League after 16 years as Marcelo Bielsa's men thrashed Stoke 5-0 on Thursday to plunge the Potters ever closer to the Championship relegation zone.
 At the top of the table, Leeds moved back one-point ahead of West Brom and opened up a six-point cushion over third-placed Brentford with just four games of the season remaining.
 Stoke's first half resistence at Elland Road was ended by Tommy Smith's rash challenge on Helder Costa and Mateusz Klich coolly converted from the penalty spot to open the floodgates.
 Leeds went 2-0 up early in the second half when Stuart Dallas picked out Costa in the box and the Portuguese converted from close range.
 Skipper Liam Cooper scored the third just before the hour mark and Pablo Hernandez smashed home in style 18 minutes from time.
 Patrick Bamford wrapped up a dominant display in stoppage time as Leeds showed no signs of the end-of-season nerves that have derailed previous promotion bids.
 Stoke on the other hand could find themselves in the third tier next season just two years on from their relegation from the Premier League.
 Michael O'Neill's men are just one point above the bottom three with just two points separating Hull in 22nd from Middlesbrough in 18th.
 Those at the bottom could be handed a lifeline, though, as a 12-point penalty for Wigan for going into administration would drop the Latics from 15th to second bottom.

 I am excited that Gaston County is taking a measured and thoughtful approach to the future of the statue in the front of the Gaston County courthouse.
 I value the opinions of all panel members and look forward to learning how Gaston County views its public buildings and what those buildings mean in the greater community.
 There are two verbs I will be looking for in the coming sessions, glorify and signify, and how these verbs reconcile with the permanence of our statue.
 The first verb is glorify, meaning to exalt or praise. Most people will recognize this word as the description on how we deliver praise or how we assign importance to someone or something.
 We glorify God or we glorify the act of charity, like donating to the Empty Stocking Fund.
 Statues can glorify someone or something. When a statue glorifies someone, it usually represents a larger than life figure who on the balance, deserves this honor.
 President Eisenhower may have had extramarital affairs, but his overwhelming contributions as a military leader and president should be glorified.
 The second verb is signify, meaning to represent or symbolize. Statues that signify something are often based on people or objects that hold special meaning.
 A statue of a dove might symbolize peace while a statue of an anonymous mill worker might symbolize the economic foundation of Gaston County. This is where the debate gets tricky because what a statue signifies can change greatly over time.
 While the Confederate statue in Gastonia may have originally intended to glorify courage and signify the southern spirit, anything associated with the confederacy is now problematic.
 The easy answer is to remove the statue. The harder answer is how one can reconcile the changes in our society.
 I propose that we leave the statue but add truthful language that explains the burden of southern history.
 In addition, rather than spending money to move or take down the statue, use those funds to construct new statues or monuments at the courthouse that better reflect civil rights.
 It's irresponsible to erase history but also irresponsible to do nothing about it.
  _Jason R. Sanders is a resident of Gastonia._

C&C’s strategy director Patrick McMahon will succeed Jonathan Solesbury as chief financial officer from the beginning of September.                                                                                                                                    Prior to heading Heineken’s British operations, Mr Forde spent four years – from 2009 – as head of Heineken Ireland.                                                                                                                                    Shares in Woodie’s DIY retail owner Grafton Group, meanwhile, jumped just over 4% on the back of it reporting strong demand across its retail and builders merchants businesses, with trading in June being more resilient than anticipated.                                                                                                                                    Due to the Covid-19 disruption, however, Grafton – which generates the vast bulk of its group revenues from its UK builders’ merchants division – said group revenue for the six months to the end of June was down by 19.4% at £1.06bn (€1.2bn).                                                                                                                                    In Ireland, Grafton reopened its Chadwicks merchants chain and its Woodie’s DIY retail chain on May 18. The group said Chadwicks saw average daily like-for-like revenue growth of over 7% in June, while the initial surge in demand at Woodie’s continued “at a moderating pace”, helping to establish a new monthly revenue record for the retailer.

As with Wainwright's best works, it's musical theater without the theater (remember, he once interpolated the theme from _Phantom of the Opera_ on _Release the Stars ' _"Between My Legs") and it comes with all of the good and bad that comes with stage drama. "You Ain't Big" would sound a bit like the Doobie Brothers' "Black Water" with its dixie-jazz-influenced folk, as he croons, "You ain't big unless you're big in Alabama, don't know who you are unless you made it in Wichita," if he didn't sing it with a smirk. And "Unfollow the Rules" loses itself in schmaltz. But of course, that's the point. It's a lush, grandiose place to be if you're looking to get lost.

PanchkulaWeddings are now simple affairs due to the Covid-19 outbreaks, without band-baja and limited baraat, leaving musical band owners in the tricity virtually penniless, with some of them taking to selling vegetables from their workspace to tide over the crisis. "Initially I waited for things to improve, but when we were on the verge of a breakdown and had nothing to eat, I decided to sell vegetables," says Surjit Singh, owner of Hira Band in Manimajra. Outside what used to be his workspace, where he would book clients for weddings and his team members would gather to practise musical numbers, Surjit Singh now keeps containers full of bottle gourd, tomatoes and potatoes.He has to now get up as early as 4 am to go to the mandi and buy vegetables. The family is surviving on whatever little he manages to earn, which he says is "enough for our meals."DEFAULTING ON RENTThe losses have been enormous. "We had received bookings worth ₹4 lakh to ₹5 lakh for March, April and May. But because of the Covid-19 outbreak, all events were cancelled and I have been left bankrupt. I have not paid rent of around ₹30,000 for stores where the band's musical instruments are kept," he adds.Walk into one of the rooms and you see scarlet uniforms of the band members piled up in one corner next to trumpets and drums, all gathering dust in a room that is under lock and key since March 22, the day lockdown begin in Chandigarh.Dharamvir Chihan, 47, owner of Durga Band, too, has had his finances drained because of a year's advance payment of ₹16 lakh to 20 men working for him. All of them have left for their homes."In this business, agreements are signed in advance and a huge percentage of payments are made at the beginning of the financial year. I had just paid my workers in advance when the lockdown was announced, because of which bookings of ₹6 lakh to ₹7 lakh were cancelled," he says.Every year Chihan's band signs contracts to perform at about a 100 weddings, with business peaking from October to February and then from March to May.Chihan has also defaulted on his monthly rent of ₹20,000 for storage space for musical equipment other items belonging to the band. "What is bothering me is the uncertainty. No one knows when things will normalise. I have a brother and only know how to work in a band. Where will we get the money to start another business?"Sustained by hopeAmit Kapoor, owner of Mohali Based Harish band has also started selling vegetables. About 25 of his bookings were cancelled due to the lockdown. His band members and other workers, too, have left for their hometowns and villages."We are hoping that work will restart from Janamashtami in August. Or else, we will have to change what we do. As of now I will continue to sell vegetables. I have to feed my children."His only concern is that if the pandemic continues he will not have any money left to care for his family and six horses they own and hire out for wedding processions.There is no hope in Sanjay Sihaan's voice when the owner of Krishna Band of Chandigarh says, "there is no business."

A case relating to two Canadian Sikhs being placed on a no-fly list in the country has now been linked to an alleged Pakistan-based plot to use pro- Khalistan elements to conduct terrorist acts in India, according to a new report.
 The details emerged as two men -- Bhagat Singh Brar and his business partner Parvkar Singh Dulai -- challenged being blocked from travelling by air. According to the report from Stewart Bell in the Canadian outlet Global News, Brar was "promoting extremism, including the radicalisation of youth, with the aim of achieving Khalistan independence; and attack planning and facilitation, including weapons procurement, to conduct attacks in India," as per supporting case documents filed by Canadian security agencies, including Public Safety Canada, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and Canadian Security Intelligence Service, the country's spy agency.
 Dulai was described as a "facilitator of terrorist-related activities and has shown an ongoing pattern of involvement within the Khalistani extremist milieu".
 The report said that Brar visited Pakistan in 2015 and collaborated with one Gurjeet Singh Cheema to plan an attack in India. These documents alleged that Brar collected donations for gurdwaras and "is suspected to have been diverting major part of the funds for anti-India activities". He was also linked to Pakistan's intelligence service, ISI. Dulai has been described as a very vocal supporter of Khalistan.
   
   
 Brar again visited Pakistan in 2018 to meet his father who happens to be Lakhbir Singh Rode, nephew of Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale and founder of the banned International Sikh Youth Federation.
 To be clear, none of these allegations have been proven in any court nor have either Brar or Dulai been charged with terrorism. Both have also denied the allegations contained in the Canadian security documents in filings made by their lawyers in this case.
 Shuvaloy Majumdar, a senior fellow with the Ottawa-based Macdonald-Laurier Institute, said that Bell's explosive article exposed the "depth" of how Pakistan's intelligence operations position themselves as community brokers. "This is a national security story impacting not one but two democracies, and has to be taken seriously as any other state sponsorship of terrorism."
 Officials at India's high commission in Ottawa refused to comment on these revelations. However, Indian officials said New Delhi believes this instance buttresses their belief that Pakistan is intricately involved in pro-Khalistan activities in Canada, including attempted terror attacks in India.

 Bhagat Singh Brar and Parvkar Singh Dulai are in the no-fly list Canada for facilitating terror; the former is the son of Lakhbir Singh Rode, nephew of slain militant preacher Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale

The incredibly ambitious and player-driven sci-fi MMO Dual Universe finally has a Beta launch date, which will allow anyone who purchases the subscription model to gain access. The official Beta release date is August 27th, and we got a brand new cinematic trailer to celebrate the announcement which provides a clearer picture to the actual story present.
 Dual Universe is a rather ambitious title as it allows players to pretty much do whatever the hell they want. In this MMO, every ship built, every house constructed, and battle waged over large-scale civilizations are all driven by the players. Create your own factions and nations, claim your own territory and buy, sell, or trade goods with other players. It’s a pretty crazy idea if you ask me, but nevertheless you can check out the new story trailer below:
 According to the developers Novaquark, the subscriptions for Dual Universe include either 3 months for $20.97, 6 months for $38.45, or 12 months for $69.90, averaging around $6.41 each month, more or less depending on the level.

Fue el turno de Joe Walsh, quien se fue a los inicios de Ringo como músico en el Cuarteto de Liverpool para dar una versión de Boys, la cual el exEagle mostró su poderío ritmico.

"I just kind of grew up around it," Walker says. "These girls were just doing their job and they'd smile and nod and act excited to be there. I felt like I was kind of in on the joke, because I was behind the scenes. They'd smile for the picture and then turn around and you'd catch an eye roll.
