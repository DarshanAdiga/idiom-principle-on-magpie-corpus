Concerns for Kanye West have grown after he went on an hour-long Twitter rant claiming his wife Kim Kardashian had called a doctor to "lock me up".
 The 43-year-old rapper has had a tumultuous 24 hours after he broke down in tears at his first presidential campaign rally in South Carolina.
 Seemingly tweeting form his ranch in Wyoming, Kanye has now alleged that Kim was looking to "bring a doctor" so that they can "lock me up."
 Kanye also took aim at Kim for her appearance in Playboy magazine as well as calling out to Kris Jenner to get in touch.
 Fans of the rapper are worried after Kanye taunted his family before suggesting that they were about to perform an intervention.
