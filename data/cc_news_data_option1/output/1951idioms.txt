Republicans have touted Garcia's victory as a sign that their political fortunes are improving. Rep. Tom Emmer, R-Minn., who leads the House GOP's campaign arm, has said it means his party can win the House.             But Democrats are still favored to retain House control and seem likely to keep most contested suburban seats this November. That's a reflection of how Trump's divisive rhetoric and erratic performance have alienated moderate suburban voters, especially women.             Garcia and Smith will face each other again in November for a full two-year House term. Democrats are expecting a far higher turnout by Democratic voters in November, drawn to polling places by having Trump's name on the ballot.             Tiffany will represent a rural, conservative-leaning district in Wisconsin. He replaces former GOP Rep. Sean Duffy, who said he left office to spend more time with his family.            With Garcia and Tiffany joining the House, Democrats control the chamber 233-198, with one independent and three vacancies.

The Portland Gale of 1898 is remembered as the deadliest weather event in New England maritime history. The Thanksgiving weekend storm claimed over 450 lives along the coast, including 192 aboard the doomed steamer S.S. Portland.            Forty other vessels were destroyed or damaged, including the 344-ton schooner Albert L. Butler near the Peaked Hill Lifesaving Station in Provincetown on the morning of November 27, 1898. Two of the crew and a passenger were lost.            "The sailors perished as a result of their own rashness and lack of self possession, when they might have certainly have been saved," according to the U.S. Lifesaving Service report of 1899.            "The passenger, from Jamaica, fell from the rigging while the schooner was plunging shoreward, and was beyond any help either from the vessel or the land. The sailors perished as a result of their own rashness and lack of self possession, when they might have certainly have been saved. The passenger, from Jamaica, fell from the rigging while the schooner was plunging shoreward, and was beyond any help either from the vessel or the land."            The Butler, with a crew of seven, was heading from Jamaica to Boston with a full cargo of logwood. Already having encountered rough seas, the storm intensified as the vessel was 40 miles off Highland Light in Truro. After more progress to the north, the ship was driven by northeast gales toward shore. Captain Frank Leland figured that his ship "made a dead drift of about 15 miles."            By 7 a.m. the next morning, the ship was approaching Peaked Hill Bars, considered to be one of the deadliest stretches along the Atlantic coast. Leland described the sea as "frightful, the biggest I ever saw, and the gale swept us at its mercy."            The vessel drifted for three hours until about 10 a.m., when "the shore breakers were under her forefoot, and she swung broadside high onto the beach."            While on patrol, Peaked Hill surfman B.F. Henderson and High Head surfman Benjamin Kelley spotted the Butler when she struck the sandbar, and quickly relayed the information to the Peaked Hill Station. Shortly after 11 a.m., the apparatus was ready at the wreck scene. Keeper Cook fired two shots from the Lyle gun from a high bank, and a sailor on board the Butler began to fasten the whip line. However, he failed to do so efficiently, and the man ended up being dragged through the breakers to shore.            Shortly after, the mizzen mast gave way and crashed, fouling the rigging and whip line. Two men panicked, and, despite warning from the surfmen, tried to go in as the man before them did. As the keeper said, "A big sea, I should say 20 feet high, rolled in and buried the vessel, men and everything. I had hold of the whip line, and could feel when the sailors lost their grasp. They were washed off, and that was the last we knew of them."            Leland washed ashore on a piece of wreckage. He and two other men were pulled up while trying to climb the bank.            "If they (the lost men) had worked the lifesaving lines properly, they would doubtless have been saved," said Leland. "They were all used up and badly scared, hardly in a condition to do things in an orderly and sensible way."            By day's end on November 27, debris, lifejackets and bodies from the S.S. Portland began washing ashore in the same location. The wreck remained on the beach for several weeks, with the masts and fittings stripped by Cape wreckers.

The airline industry has been one of the hardest hit by the COVID-19 pandemic. Air travel dropped by more than 95 percent as the coronavirus spread across the U.S., effectively grounding what had been for several years, a travel boom.            Delta, American and United Airlines reported major first-quarter losses, and expect even worse financial news for the second quarter. Delta CEO Ed Bastian said it could take two to three years for business to recover.            Now as states across the country begin to gradually lift stay-at-home orders and businesses begin to reopen, airlines are instituting major changes to get passengers back on board and show it's safe to travel by plane.            Some of these new safety measures include intensified aircraft cleanings using electrostatic sprayers, new boarding procedures, fewer passengers per flight and new seating plans to promote social distancing. All major airlines and many airports are now requiring passengers to wear face coverings and last week, McCarran International Airport became the first to introduce vending machines selling PPE such as masks, gloves, hand sanitizer and disinfecting wipes. Temperature checks for passengers before boarding and immunity passports are also being considered.

The features are in testing in the Canary version of Edge and Windows Insider preview versions.            The move is part of Microsoft's enthusiastic embrace of web technology over the past few years. The software giant's recent approach, which stands in stark contrast to the company's concerns in the 1990s that the web might encroach on Windows' turf, comes as the operating system competes with mobile OSes, like Google's Android and Apple's iOS and iPadOS. All of those operating systems employ web technology.            ## Chromium-based Edge moves to more PCs            Microsoft has begun a major push to overhaul its Edge web browser, which had been based on a stripped-down core of its older Internet Explorer browser. Microsoft ditched that approach, though, because it was spending too much time trying to keep up with Google's Chrome. Now Edge is built on Google's Chromium project, the open-source foundation of Google Chrome and several other browsers.            Microsoft is replacing its old Internet Explorer with a new version of its Edge browser based on Google's open-source Chromium project -- and giving it a new wave-like icon.

Hammock was in eighth grade when he hatched the idea of starting a bass fishing team at Flowery Branch. His cousin was a member of the Jefferson High School fishing team, and together, along with a few other friends, they put together the plans to start the Flowery Branch High School Anglers.            “We got information on how to start a team and how to get kids to be a part of a team,” Hammock said. “It was something me and my buddies really enjoyed to do. We really loved to fish, and we wanted to open it up to everybody in my school.”            At 14, Hammock secured sponsorships for the team, picking up financial support from local businesses like Nichols Bodyshop, Oakwood Bait and Tackle, AVC Marine, Marine Klean and Outdoor Depot, among others. He also had to contact and coordinate with boat captains, so each of the group’s 10 teams of two fishermen would have everything they needed to compete. Hammock said he connected with several boat owners on Facebook who were willing to take kids out fishing for free if the scheduling lined up.            “We had a ton of support behind us in the community, and they were able to make this happen,” he said.             Hammock’s love for fishing is even helping to pay for his higher education.             Following a first-place outing with partner Brooks Anderson at the SAF Early Bird Open this January, Hammock got a call from Erskine College head bass fishing coach Ryan Teems with a scholarship offer to join the team. Hammock said 75% of his college schooling is being paid for through the sport he has loved since his middle school days.

Sadly, our last line of defense is the strange real estate billionaire who happens to head the executive branch at the moment. Vetoes can be overridden, but Trump needs to send a signal that his answers to the crisis are the ones that are going to happen. He can manipulate the Mainstream Media to get what he wants, and his light being shone onto a topic can be game changing. Sadly, thus far Trump has been focused more on #Obamagate than either of the two issues presented in this piece, meaning that his ego issues could allow the 4th Amendment to die right in front of our faces. In contrast however, at some point he will probably fight the $3 trillion spending bill because Pelosi is involved in it and she is a bad lady so maybe there is some hope.

Congressman Jeff Van Drew, R-2nd, made national news in his freshman year in Congress, which he started as a Democrat and ended as a Republican.            Long known as a moderate in the state Assembly and Senate, many thought Van Drew would continue to be a solid Democrat who occasionally deviated from the party on issues like gun rights, after he was elected in 2018 to fill the seat of longtime Congressman Frank LoBiondo, a moderate Republican.            But right from the start, Van Drew set himself apart by voting "no" for Nancy Pelosi for Speaker -- fulfilling a campaign promise but confusing those on the House floor. He was supposed to call out a name of someone for speaker, so his "no" vote was recorded as "present."            Then he was one of the few Democrats calling for bipartisan compromise on a budget to end what became the longest federal government shutdown in history. Later, he visited the southern border and came back saying there was, indeed, a crisis there. He supported both some funding for a border wall, and increased funding for housing and services to undocumented migrants. Van Drew was also one of just two Demcorats to first vote against proceeding with an impeachment inquiry, and to vote against both articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump.            And on Dec. 19, 2019, he announced his party change to Republican while sitting next to Trump in the Oval Office.

He welcomed a European Union (EU) resolution, adopted by consensus by WHO's 194 member states, that calls for an independent evaluation of the international response, "including, but not limited to, WHO's performance."            "We want accountability more than anyone," Tedros said. "We will continue providing strategic leadership to coordinate the global response" to the pandemic.            He made no reference to a threat by U.S. President Donald Trump, contained in Trump's letter to WHO tweeted overnight, to permanently halt funding for the WHO if it did not commitment to improvements within 30 days and to reconsider U.S. membership.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump is heading to Capitol Hill for lunch Tuesday with Senate Republicans as Washington considers next steps in the coronavirus response.            That's according to a person unauthorized to discuss the president's schedule and granted anonymity.            The administration is launching a full day of appearances on Capitol Hill as the White House and Congress consider another pandemic aid package.             Vice President Mike Pence and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin huddled earlier with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy.            “Very helpful,” said Mnuchin as he exited the meeting on his way to testify before the Senate Banking Committee. “Good update.”            The Capitol remains partly closed with the House away due to health risks but the smaller Senate convening under new social distancing restrictions. Among the new rules, senators are limited to three to a table at the weekly GOP luncheons. One senator and dozens of Capitol Hill workers and staff have tested positive for the virus.

Baskin inherited a bundle when Lewis vanished, including the Tampa wildlife sanctuary they owned.            His family has long claimed that the documents were altered. Authorities say the five-year statute of limitations has expired but that doesn't mean the bogus documents can't be used in a criminal trial.            Cops never had enough evidence to arrest Baskin, although Lewis' disappearance is now categorized as a murder. And detectives say that Baskin remains the prime suspect.            Lewis was declared dead in 2002 and Baskin was suddenly very rich.            After the release of Tiger King, Baskin began to face new scrutiny, including from cops who are now doubling down on finding out what really happened to Lewis.            Baskin's nemesis in Tiger King, Joe Exotic, accused her of murdering her husband and feeding his remains to her tigers.            The forgeries could be the nail in Baskin's coffin if she is charged with the murder of Lewis.            "It ties a bow on what could be her scheme to get him (Lewis) out of the picture," Matt Steffey, a professor at the Mississippi College of Law, told the Clarion-Ledger            "She has motive anyway, but this ups the stakes."            bhunter@postmedia.com            @HunterTOSun

WASHINGTON (AP) — A former Navy pilot who captured a California congressional district from Democrats and a state legislator who retained a Republican-held Wisconsin seat joined the House on Tuesday, buoying a GOP seeking momentum for its uphill fight for the chamber's majority in this fall's elections.             California's Mike Garcia and Wisconsin's Tom Tîffany, who won special elections last week to fill vacancies, are conservatives backed by President Donald Trump. Both will serve until Jan. 3, filling unexpired terms of lawmakers who resigned last year.             The two men stood side by side on the House floor as they were sworn into office by Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. In this age of the coronavirus, they elbow-bumped afterward but did not wear face masks.             Garcia's victory was more noteworthy.            Garcia's win came in a Los Angeles-area district that was among dozens of suburban seats that Democrats won from the GOP in 2018, catapulting them to House control. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton had carried the district by 7 percentage points in 2016, and two years later Democrat Katie Hill won the seat by 9 points.             But Garcia was elected last week by 10 points over Democrat Christy Smith, casting himself as an outsider against the state assemblywoman. He also raised about the same $2.3 million as Smith's campaign, unusual in an election cycle in which most Democratic candidates in competitive races are collecting significantly more in contributions.             Hill resigned last year after allegations that she'd had an inappropriate relationship with an aide.

Have you ever put spicy mustard on a sandwich? If you inadvertently glob on too much of the good stuff, you’ll swear you just snorted wasabi. When it comes to spices that are in your face (literally and figuratively), a little bit can go a long way.            In the same way, hyphens and dashes—when sprinkled into sentences properly—add just the right punch. Not only will we learn how to use the hyphen (-) properly today, but we’ll also learn how to use both the en (–) and em (—) dashes.            Let’s start with hyphens. Hyphens are like glue for two words that are connected. Use hyphens in compound adjectives, which are adjectives that precede a noun they modify in order to connect them together. Examples of compound adjectives include well-known, blue-haired, one-eyed, and ill-conceived. Hyphens are also used to separate numbers (three hundred sixty-five) and to create a line break when syllables of the same word get separated. We still see this sometimes in books and newspapers, but we see it less often now that text is not set by hand.            En dashes (–) are all about range. Use an en dash in order to show a range of numbers. Barack Obama was president from 2008–2016. The Thunder beat the Jazz, 120–101. The store is open Monday–Friday, 9 a.m.–5 p.m. The en dash is named as such because it is about the width of the letter “n.” To type an en dash on a PC, press ctrl+minus. For PC laptops without numeric keyboards, you can type alt+0150 or insert-special characters in Word. On a Mac, press option+hyphen.

He was heavily involved in the mountain bike boom of the late 1980s as a racer, team manager and race promoter, and that led to writing for Mountain Biking UK magazine shortly after its inception. He got the gig by phoning up the editor and telling him the magazine was rubbish and he could do better. Rather than telling him to get lost, MBUK editor Tym Manley called John’s bluff and the rest is history.

Apple's been rumored to be working on a pair of smart glasses for years. On Tuesday, Front Page Tech host Jon Prosser shared alleged details about the augmented reality glasses, which he says will be called Apple Glass.             Apple Glass will pair with an iPhone and be controlled by gestures on and in front of the glasses, according to Prosser, who said he saw a video of a prototype pair. Both lenses will reportedly have displays and there will also be a lidar sensor in the frames. Prosser added that Apple Glass is meant to look similar to a typical pair of glasses and likely won't feature a camera.

The one-off special saw Glover reuniting with his castmates Danny Pudi, Alison Brie, Joel McHale, Gillian Jacobs, Yvette Nicole Brown, Jim Rash and Ken Jeong, as well as creator Dan Harmon to help Jose Andres' World Central Kitchen and Frontline Foods' COVID-19 relief efforts.            During the reunion, the Atlanta star pitched an idea for a film in which Abed Nadir, the character played by Pudi, would go out in search of his own character Troy Barnes - who is considered dead or lost at sea after being captured by pirates during season five.            "I like movies like that," Glover said, "What am I doing, writing the movie on the fly or something?"            Pudi agreed, adding: "I love the idea of Troy being lost and Abed's mission is to go find him, try to track someone down - that would be fun."            The rest of the cast also raised their hands in support of the idea of a new movie, although Glover said the start of production could be some way off due to the coronavirus pandemic.            The Mandalorian star Pedro Pascal also took part in the table read, filling in for Walton Goggins, who was not available to reprise his character, Mr. Stone.

ZURICH -- UBS wants to double the amount of assets under management at its business targeting wealthy clients in Russia and central and eastern Europe, a senior manager told Reuters.            The bank is particularly looking to high net worth clients with assets in the $5-$100 million range, including from the recent boom in technology entrepreneurs.            "Russia has had a very strong start to the year, which contributed very substantially to EMEA overall both in terms of revenues and net new money," UBS' wealth management head for Central and Eastern Europe, Caroline Kuhnert, told Reuters in an interview.            "We want to grow our business very strongly. We believe we can double it over the next few years," she said, adding they were looking to double revenues as well as assets under management over the next four-five years.            Western banks limited their activity in Russia after sanctions were imposed on Moscow in 2014, freezing the funds of some wealthy Russians, with further measures imposed by the United States in 2018.            Russian President Vladimir Putin, meanwhile, has tried to encourage businesses to return funds to the country by offering a capital amnesty and tax breaks.            Now UBS, the world's largest wealth manager, wants to expand the banking services it offers to Russian multi-millionaires both through its onshore Moscow office, where it made "significant hires" last year, and offshore through teams in London, Monaco, Singapore and Switzerland.            "We want to be not only a very well recognized franchise, but we want to be the most profitable franchise (in eastern Europe)," Kuhnert said.            A trained economist and former investment banker who worked in Moscow in the early 90's for the former International Moscow Bank, Kuhnert heads up a team of roughly 300 employees covering wealth management for Central and Eastern Europe, Greece and Israel. They manage assets estimated somewhere in the mid-to-high double-digit billion U.S. dollar range.            UBS overall employs roughly 70 staff in Russia and said last week it was promoting Ekaterina Lehmann to head of global wealth management in the country, a broader role intended to help roll out services offered by a tie up between the wealth management business and the investment bank to a wider group of clients.            Kuhnert said UBS had in recent months attracted a greater share of its Russian clients' wallets as it stepped in with loans to help business owners during the coronavirus pandemic.            "Clearly in some markets in my region, government support in light of COVID-19 is less pronounced and fast than in Switzerland, for example," Kuhnert said.            "So the owners and entrepreneurs are putting money back into their businesses. And then they also look for loans from international firms like us," she added, also saying that clients were seeing opportunities to invest equity.

You will also learn about issues in the drains that may develop into problems in the future. This information is invaluable to making an informed decision before taking on such a large purchase. After all, you wouldn't buy a house or other property with inspecting it in person, and getting a building inspector to check that it is structurally sound. The problem with drains is that they are under ground and therefore out of sight. They need specialists to check them thoroughly and properly, and that's where Drainage TV come in.
