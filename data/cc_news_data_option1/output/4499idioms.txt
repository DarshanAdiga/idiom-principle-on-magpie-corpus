Boyd Cordner's concerning history with concussion is growing, but NRL teammate Luke Keary insists players have to trust they're not being put at risk by head injury experts.
 The NSW and Sydney Roosters stars have battled concussion complications over the past two years, both spending time out of the game on club orders.
 But questions around Cordner's health and future were raised during the State of Origin opener on Wednesday night with the Blues skipper copping yet another head knock.
 The dazed 28-year-old was taken from the field for a head injury assessment after an innocuous knock but later returned to the field after passing protocols.
 Those protocols have now come under fire from a leading clinician in concussion and dementia services at Macquarie University, Dr Rowena Mobbs, who has called for a review into the HIA process.
 Clinical co-director of the Australian Sports Brain Bank, Mobbs assesses high- profile Australian sports people who have suffered years of head knocks and has authored a study on chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE).
 "Players are clearly concussed at the time of impact on the field," Dr Mobbs said.
 "The crowd and commentators can see that this is a brain injury.
 "There is video evidence of brain injury, and they should be off for the game, and the next, with all caution taken.
 "How many sub-concussion knocks as well as concussion knocks are players sustaining?
 "Australia has a long way to go in this field of research to understand the risk of CTE.
 "We are calling for a national repetitive head trauma initiative that will involve neurologists providing a proper assessment of this long-term risk."
 Concern for Cordner has grown in recent months after he admitted to suffering ongoing concussion symptoms, with some calling for the inspirational forward to retire.
 This season alone he suffered three rounds of concussion and was sidelined by the Roosters for six weeks as he dealt with persistent headaches.
 It was a cautious approach by the club who also managed Keary in a similar manner in 2019.
 "It's not good to see," Keary said of Cordner's head knock.
 "We all know what he's been through so I'm not sure what to do there.
 "It's hard because as players we're not experts in the field so we're just going off the professionals opinions.
 "We know the doctors here [NSWRL] and the doctors at the club [Roosters] and the doctors the NRL all know what they're doing and they wouldn't put us at risk.
 "You can only go off the experts' opinion and you've just got to trust they're not putting you at risk."
 NSW coach Brad Fittler said he would speak to medical staff and Boyd before naming his 21-man side to take on Queensland on Wednesday night.
 However, should the Blues skipper play Game II at ANZ Stadium and cop another head knock, it would cause significant concern for his playing future.

PLYMOUTH - It's been a season filled with lessons learned for the Plymouth North cross-country program. Head Coach Cliff Buckley hopes those lessons will be the base for better times for the Eagles down the road.
 The girls are done for the season with a record of 0-5. The boys are 1-3, with a win over Silver Lake, and have one race left to go at Hingham on Thursday.
 "For a number of reasons we were in re-building mode this season. We were really small on the girl's side with eight runners. We had more options in the boys program with about 25 runners, but in that entire group there was only a couple seniors," Buckley said. "The kids learned a lot this season and improved as we went along. Hopefully we all can do some recruiting in the off- season and start building those numbers back to where they've been in prior years."
 "Having such a short window to compete was tough on the team. I think we would have usually started around Aug. 23 and the first day of practice turned out to be closer to Sept. 18. That gave us around six weeks to get ready and have some meets. We all had to take things day-by-day and adjust expectations as needed," Buckley explained. "The kids are just starting to see the fruits of their hard work right now and hopefully they can take those gains into their off-season workouts. We were getting a lot of personal best times at the end of the season."
 Buckley is also the head coach of the winter track and the boys spring track and field programs at Plymouth North. He took over the cross-country program before the start of the season when former head coach John Laverty stepped down.
 The one senior Buckley had in the boys program is his own son, Will. He is co- captain of the boys team along with junior Jason McGettrick.
 "I've had Will on my other track teams before, but it was nice to spend some more time with him this season," Buckley said. "It was fun for me to have the chance to coach him in a different setting. Will was a top runner on the boys side and he had good year."
 Cole Guiliani also had a good season and sophomores Nick Rodden and Jaycob Carpenter improved their times with experience.
 The highlight of the girls season was the addition of sophomore Kelly Palmer who quickly became the lead runner for the Lady Eagles.
 "Kelly is a basketball player. She came out for the team to get in shape for the winter season and we found out she's a good runner," Buckley said. "She did an amazing job this season and made some real improvements in her times as the season went along. By the end of the season she was our clear #1 runner."
 Junior Celina Ohiwa is captain of the girls team. Senior Isabella Pearson ran well and sophomore Olivia Lennon as well as junior Grace McNeill will return with another year of running experience.
 There is still a chance that a final Patriot League championship meet could be scheduled for sometime next week. But if that meet is not organized the Eagles already have their homework assignment for the off-season.
 "There's some recruiting to be done to replenish our numbers and that's something we'll all be working on," Buckley said. One of his off-season goals was to triple the number of runners in the girls program for 2021.

CHAMPAIGN -- It has been a whirlwind last week for former Peoria High School football star Coran Taylor.
   
 Taylor, a sophomore reserve quarterback for Lovie Smith at the University of Illinois, was thrust into the spotlight when starting quarterback Brandon Peters tested positive or COVID-19 and reserve Isaiah Williams was sidelined due to contact tracing protocol.
   
 The Illini started backup Matt Robinson over Taylor, but Robinson went down with an ankle injury in the first quarter against Purdue.
   
 Taylor came in and threw for 273 yards, two touchdowns and two interceptions, completing 17 of 29 passes and nearly led the Illini back from a 21-point fourth quarter deficit.
   
 Illinois lost 31-24 and Taylor made some crucial mistakes along the way, including a fumble inside the 10-yard line that Purdue returned for a touchdown in the third quarter to go up 31-10.
   
 But the Peoria native buoyantly led the offense on a fourth-quarter surge that inspired confidence in the offense and completed four-straight passes for 69 yards, capped off by a 28-yard dime to tight end Daniel Imatorbhebhe for a touchdown.
   
 It didn't work out, but Taylor showed promise that excited Illinois. Players like tight end Luke Ford and longtime teammate Kendrick Green spoke out in praise and support of Taylor.
   
 Green recounted their days at Peoria High, when they'd walk to practice together each day. He said he saw Taylor's potential back then and never doubted he had what it takes to play at the Big Ten Conference level.
   
 "In high school during the summer, (Taylor) lived right around the corner from me," Green said. "I would walk to his house all summer and we would really walk to practice every day. We grew up in East Bluff, Peoria, Illinois -- tough area. We're tough kids, man."
   
 "Coran, he gets in the game, I knew what he was capable of doing. If he corrects turning the ball over and things like that, he's just as good as anybody we've got in our quarterback room. I really feel like that."
   
 Taylor knows he'll need to make improvements in his first week as the Illini's de facto starting quarterback. On Monday, Smith said Robinson's status was unclear for Saturday's game against Minnesota, though he said it wasn't a season-ending injury.
   
 "It means a lot," Taylor said of leading a Big Ten offense. "It means a lot for me and my family. I know they're proud. I'm proud of myself. I've got a lot to work on moving forward."
   
 The dual-threat quarterback knows that he can succeed in third-year offensive coordinator Rod Smith's offense, though he'll need to work on his ball security and his reads on throws.
   
 Taylor was calm under pressure when his team needed him, and he sees the positives and negatives from his first meaningful outing. He was joking with the media in the postgame presser, even as he acknowledged he had a long way to go.
   
 "I looked good," Taylor said of the moment he entered the game. "I put on my good clothes, you know -- nah, just playing," he said with a laugh.
   
 "It was a little bit rowdy. When Matt first went down, it was like, 'Coran, c'mon, c'mon!' So then I was a little anxious, but after I got the first couple of snaps I was good."
   
 Without hesitation, Taylor threw on the run, stood in the pocket and delivered and, of course, broke out for some chunks of yardage on his own. Rod Smith and Lovie Smith each praised his play and effort, and Rod is now game-planning around Taylor for a crucial game against the Golden Gophers on Saturday afternoon.
   
 "Sometimes what makes those guys really good football players is their ability to take chances and their ability to try plays or try certain things that maybe other guys wouldn't," Rod Smith said. "Sometimes it works for you and sometimes it doesn't. The key is how do you play within structure of the offense? That's the key. How do you play within structure and do what we kind of ask you to do through a certain period of time over the course of a play, but once that breaks down, then it's on him."
   
 Rod spoke at length on Monday about Taylor's ability to improvise, play on the move and pick up yardage with his ability to make defenders miss.
   
 "That's where him improvising or elongating plays and doing things like that is where he comes in," he said. "I think we just need to hone in on the decision-making, hone in and make sure his eyes are right, his eye discipline is correct, his eyes and his thoughts and his decisions are in the right area where it needs to be. From there, you got to be able to play fast and play loose. I think Coran will definitely do that."
   
 Taylor said that Tim Thornton's offense at Peoria High helped him prepare for the up-tempo, often run-heavy offense favored at Illinois. Minus the mistakes, Taylor said he felt at home while managing the Illini attack.
   
 "A lot of RPOs, tempo plays, QB runs and stuff," Taylor said. "It was all incorporated in (the) play-calling, so that's why I felt pretty comfortable."
   
 "Just staying the course, staying humble, staying focused and staying locked in," he continued. "That's what it looked like."
   
 Taylor brings badly-needed confidence and playmaking ability for an 0-2 Illini team that -- in Smith's fifth year -- is expected to put together a winning season.
   
 For the first time, he is getting the starting quarterback's share of reps in practice. Mostly up until now, Taylor was taking the fourth-string reps. Sometimes that only means four or five reps a day, and it always means taking mental reps and following along from the sideline as the offense works.
   
 Green loved what he saw out of his longtime teammate and friend, and he's confident Taylor can make the jump needed to beat a Minnesota team that defeated Illinois 40-17 in 2019.
   
 "He made plays," Green said. "He might've had a few dropped balls today as well. It is what it is though. Coran did what he had to do. I've known all my life what he's capable of."
   
 Taylor has never lacked the confidence needed to shine under pressure. On Saturday, he'll be tested again, but this time it will come after a full week of prep instead of late notice after the bulk of preparation had already been completed.
   
 His teammates and coaches have rallied around him, recognizing that Taylor is now going to be instrumental as Illinois looks to bounce back midseason.
   
 "The situation that we're in, he saw this as his opportunity to go and make his mark," Rod Smith said. "I think what it shows is it showed his real confidence, it showed his real personality."

The foundation funds scholarships and provides coaching and mentoring in remote Aboriginal communities, and support for education, travel, equipment and nutrition.
 "Their home life is very different to the ones in the city," Moriarty said. "That's why our program looks after them with their well-being, and using our football to bring them together and for them to have opportunities to pursue after their schooling."
 Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders comprise 2% of Australia's adult population, but are the most disadvantaged ethnic minority in the country and have higher-than-average rates of infant mortality and poorer overall health, as well as shorter life expectancy and lower levels of education and employment.
 TAKEN AWAY, GIVING BACK
 Moriarty didn't have any choice about leaving Borroloola and his Yanyuwa people. He was part of the so-called Stolen Generation, an era when bi-racial children were taken from their Aboriginal parents under government policies and sent to residential homes. Moriarty was 4 when he was first sent to a school near Sydney in the early 1940s and later to another school in Adelaide, where he had a first foray into football. The soccer club next door became a great distraction.
 "With the football, I think it was the opportunity to take on the game, but also the opportunities that come with the game," he said. "What it gave me was the opportunity to do things in so many other areas."
 Moriarty graduated from university and worked in government and industry before he and his wife, Ros, founded the Aboriginal-owned strategy and design agency Balarinji in 1983 -- Balarinji designs have been used on Qantas aircraft. They started the Moriarty Foundation as a non-for-profit in 2012 -- at the request of elders in Borroloola who wanted to see their grandchildren get a better education.
 Moriarty thinks for some kids involved with JMF, "the world is their oyster."
 "They can not only develop their soccer skills here, but also if they're good enough (can) represent their country and play overseas," Moriarty said. ""Football gave me such a great start, it was why we started our program to bring the kids together."
 Having a graduate break through to the elite foreign leagues would be "phenomenal for them as individuals, for their families and for Aboriginal people and for this nation," Moriarty said. "Those times are coming."
 FOOTBALL FAMILY
 Jada Whyman is also a JMF ambassador, although she took a different path to the W-League. She started playing in Wagga Wagga, a sports-mad town halfway between Sydney and Melbourne. After excelling at other sports, she started playing soccer with the encouragement of her grandfather who, like Moriarty, was part of the Stolen Generation.
 She tried out for goalkeeper in a local representative team because it was the only spot available -- a sliding doors moment. Her career progressed quickly. Her family moved to the national capital of Canberra, where they lived in a caravan park for several months, and then to Sydney in her early teens. It paid off when she earned selection for Australia's national youth teams and a contract for Western Sydney Wanderers.
 Along the way, a TV interview she saw featuring Lydia Williams, the Indigenous goalkeeper for the Australian women's team and now for Arsenal in England's Women's Super League, gave her some extra resolve.
 The 21-year-old Whyman said the JMF's financial support helped young Indigenous players overcome some of the biggest obstacles to progressing in the game.
 "But also, it's bringing community together. It's about indigenous football but also it's about showing us as people, we're strong," Whyman said. "It's a statement of community, that we want to move forward together. And the way we do that is by supporting one another."
 She said it's not just about skills and drills, recounting how she's ended some clinics doing TikToks with the kids.
 "They're not just kicking the ball around. They do mindful activities. They have a feed afterward -- food cooked by the coaches," she said. "That's more of a family kind of thing."
 WHAT NEXT?
 Indigenous athletes have excelled at Australian rules, the homegrown variety of football, and rugby and are well represented in the national AFL and NRL competitions.
 But soccer was slower to catch on, despite a more global platform.
 Craig Foster, a former Socceroo and a director of JMF, said Moriarty's foundation is helping soccer "fast become the de facto Indigenous game."
 Foster said it's crucial that an Indigenous organization is leading the way for Aboriginal people in soccer, but also thinks it's essential for football's national governing body to be making longer-term financial and social commitments.
 "The mistake we've always made as a game is seeing indigenous football as a program," Foster told the AP. "It's not a program. It's an underlying commitment to our First Nations. That's my message for Indigenous Football Week 2020."
 He said having "an Indigenous legendary Socceroos squad member" at the helm and coaches who are predominantly Indigenous in communities ensured JMF took a holistic approach rather than "a fly-in, fly-out talent ID program."
 "This is about uplifting Indigenous Australian children through football, this is not about finding the next Matilda," Foster said. "That's a happy corollary of the fact you've got thousands of indigenous kids playing football. Of course there's going to be talent, and you can identify them, but that's not the essence of the program."
 Still, having JMF graduates in top teams is a positive spin-off from any perspective.
 "Shay Evans is extraordinary. She's a model for John Moriarty Football in many respects, not just the fact she came from a remote community," Foster said. "She's a future star because she's driven, she's smart, she's committed, she's disciplined.
 "She's a brilliant Aboriginal young woman in every respect, not just the fact she can kick a ball."

BILLINGS, Mont. - The Yellowstone County Elections Office stopped counting ballots at midnight and resumed early Wednesday morning.
 Yellowstone County Elections Administrator Bret Rutherford says the last person to vote out of MetraPark finished around 1 a.m. Wednesday.
 The elections office has tabulators in the courthouse which are being used to count in-person Election Day ballots. The latest voter turnout percentage was sitting around 75% and they are expecting it to push up to 80%. Rutherford says the county broke its record in sheer volume of ballots, but most likely won't break its record in percentage voter turnout.
 "Right now, there is nothing in recount range in Yellowstone County, but there are some fairly close legislative seats, and as far as statewide goes, there are still some other counties that are actually counting too," Rutherford said. "It sounds like everything has been called for the most part, so it would take some drastic movement to shift back into recount range, which is a half a percent or less, down to a tie vote."
 Rutherford says results aren't completely final until they get canvassed by the counties and state which takes a couple weeks.
