One of the biggest reveals at Thursday night's Game Awards was The Callisto Protocol, a new sci-fi survival horror game from a team of veterans who worked on EA's Dead Space series. It's still a long way off, scheduled for 2022, and the cinematic trailer is more of a mood piece than anything. We can glean that it's set in a dingy futuristic prison, and there's a very nasty monster (alien? mutant?) on the premises. I couldn't get much more concrete detail out of chief development officer Steve Papoutsis when we chatted after the reveal, but I did at least confirm one suspicion: Dead Space's beloved holographic HUD is coming back in some form.
 In one of the first shots in the trailer, an unnamed prisoner sits up in bed. On his neck is a glowing green implant--what I'd guess is some kind of restraining implant, green to symbolize he's currently healthy. It's a pretty blatant nod to the spinal cord health indicator on the back of Dead Space's suits, a cleverly "in-universe" way to communicate without plastering a HUD over the action. Dead Space famously did that for everything, projecting its menus as holograms instead of breaking immersion.
 I'm not exactly doing Sherlock-level detective work noticing the callback here, and Papoutsis played a little coy outright confirming it, but I think it's safe to say The Callisto Protocol is going to have a similar system.
 "Interesting observation you made there," he said with a grin. "I can't really go into detail on that one, but you've got a keen eye."
 My guess is we're going to see plenty of action, but for Papoutsis, horror definitely seems to be the priority. "What we're really hoping to do is genuinely scare our players, and hopefully have them have memorable experiences while playing the game," he says.
 Most of the other things I asked about Papoutsis wants to keep secret; he wouldn't even say what kinds of weapons we should expect from The Callisto Protocol or who we'll be playing as. But I did at least get a few tidbits about the setting. It's set in the year 2320 at a prison colony called Black Iron, unsurprisingly on Jupiter's moon Callisto. But are we a prisoner? The warden? Will there be a gun as cool as Dead Space's rotating pistol?
 "We want people's minds to explore all the potential things that _might_ be, and then we'll talk about that in the future," he says. I imagine we'll learn more next year.

US tech giants such as Facebook and Google face unprecedented regulation in Europe, as the EU prepares to unveil landmark proposals that could change the face of life online.
 The EU wants the Digital Services Act and its accompanying Digital Markets Act to set strict conditions for internet giants to do business in the bloc's 27 countries.
 The biggest tech firms will be designated internet "gatekeepers", subject to specific regulation, in a proposal that will be unveiled by EU vice president Margrethe Vestager and commissioner Thierry Breton on Tuesday.
 Google, Facebook, Apple and Amazon and maybe a few others will almost certainly be slapped with the designation, which could be compared to big banks that are deemed "too big to fail" and subject to special oversight.
 "We've come to a point where the power of digital businesses -- especially the biggest gatekeepers -- threaten our freedoms, our opportunities, even our democracy," said Vestager.
 "So for the world's biggest gatekeepers, things are going to have to change. They are going to have to take more responsibility."
 The proposals will go through a long and complex ratification process, with the EU's 27 member states, the European Parliament, and a lobbying frenzy of companies and trade associations, influencing the final law.
 France and the Netherlands have already come out in favour of Europe having all the tools it needs to rein in the gatekeepers, including the power to break them up.
 \- 'Blunt and rigid' -
 Big Tech, unsurprisingly, is asking for moderation and wants companies to be judged not simply by their size.
 "What we could end up having would be blunt and rigid rules targeting size instead of problematic conduct," said Kayvan Hazemi-Jebelli, an expert at the Computer and Communications Industry Association, a big tech lobby group.
 For the past decade the EU has taken the lead worldwide in trying to grapple with the insurmountable power of big tech, slapping billions in antitrust fines against Google, but critics believe the method has done little to change its behaviour.
 The EU has also ordered Apple to pay billions of euros in back taxes to Ireland, but that decision was quashed by the EU's highest court.
 In the meantime, US authorities have taken up the call and are themselves reassessing the role of big tech, with several major antitrust cases putting Google under the gun in addition to a legal bid to strip Facebook of its Instagram and Whatsapp products.
 The details of the proposal have been carefully guarded by the European Commission, the EU's executive arm, even though a few details have leaked.
 What is certain is that gatekeepers will face built-for-purpose dos and don'ts that may include a ban on companies prioritising their own services on their platforms or chasing away rivals by exploiting data inaccessible to others.
 \- 'Control their power' -
 The Digital Services Act is expected to give the commission sharper teeth in pursuing social media platforms when they allow illegal content online, with the power to inflict fines, possibly through a newly created EU authority, instead of the voluntary system that exists now.
 Tech giants will be especially vigilant to maintain their exemption from liability when it comes to illegal content on their platforms, a status they say preserves free speech since it prevents over-enforcement and creates fertile ground for the innovation that triggered the internet revolution.
 The proposal may not go as far as reversing that exemption, but it will clearly increase the platform's responsibility by setting out clear rules and incentives for ad transparency and online information.
 Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon and Microsoft fear measures that would set a precedent in the rest of the world, calling into question their way of working, says Alexandre de Streel, co-director of the think-tank Center on Regulation in Europe (Cerre).
 "For the first time, we would have asymmetric regulation which would focus only on the big players," he told AFP. "We're going to put rules in place to control their power."

Gov. Doug Ducey will not order any businesses closed in three Arizona counties that, by his own standards, now have a substantial transmission of COVID-19, with a press aide saying there’s no reason for that.
 New data Thursday from the Department of Health Services shows that Yavapai, Apache and Navajo counties all have two consecutive weeks where all three indicators of viral spread have gone into the “red zone.” Under Ducey’s own orders, that should require shuttering all movie theaters, fitness centers, gyms and bars, even those that agree to operate like restaurants.
 In fact, none of these were permitted to operate at all earlier this year until the risk of spread in all three categories was reduced to the “moderate” level. That includes the rate of cases per 100,000 residents, the percent of residents testing positive for the virus, and the number of patients showing up at hospitals with COVID-like symptoms.
 Ducey press aide C.J. Karamargin does not dispute the sharp hike in COVID infections. And even Cara Christ, the state’s health chief, said Thursday that the rate of infection in the entire state for the past week has reached 500 per 100,000.
 “This far exceeds the benchmark for substantial transmission, which is far above the 100 per 100,000 people,” she said
 But Karamargin said that the evidence shows the spike is coming not from businesses that the state can control but instead from things the state cannot, like family gatherings. And he said Ducey believes it makes no sense to close businesses because of rising infections, even if that is what is called for in his own standards.
 It isn’t just the benchmarks set by Ducey and the health department that show a substantial risk of spread in Arizona.
 A separate state-by-state analysis looks at what researchers call the “R-naught” number, essentially an indicator of how fast the virus is growing. Anything above 1.0 shows spread.
 On Thursday, Arizona hit 1.22. That’s not only the highest in the nation but the highest for Arizona since the middle of May, before Ducey ordered many businesses to close their doors.
 In some ways, the governor’s decision not to shut businesses as the standards require is no surprise. Ducey has publicly taken the position that, even in the face of rising cases, his focus is on economic health.
 “Arizona’s open,” the governor said as recently as September when there were the first indications of a rise in infections.
 “Arizona’s economy is open, Arizona’s education institutions are open, Arizona’s tourism institutions are open,” he said. “The expectation is they are going to remain open.”
 While there are just three counties now officially at risk of substantial spread, others are at risk — and potentially just a week away from hitting the same levels.
 The benchmarks established by the governor and his health chief set up a system designed to show the risk level based on two weeks’ worth of data. That is designed to keep an unusual spike from throwing a county into a different category.
 But even using that standard, Yavapai, Apache and Navajo counties have more than 100 cases per 100,000 residents for at least two weeks.
 In fact, the rate in Yavapai County is now 423 people per 100,000. It is 667 in Apache County and 418 in Navajo County.
 And all the numbers are at least a week old, with Christ warning Thursday that things are getting worse even as Arizona waits for the rollout of a vaccine.
 The second test for substantial spread is when more than 10% of people tested show positive for the virus.
 Here, too, all three counties have been in that range for two weeks, with the current figure of 20.7% for Yavapai and 16.5% for both Apache and Navajo counties.
 The third standard is based on more than 10% of the people seeking medical care have a COVID-like illness. All three counties logged in at 13.8%.
 “There’s no question about it, Arizona’s numbers are headed in the wrong direction,” said Karamargin. “And what we’re seeing in increased cases certainly are having an impact on communities across the state.”
 But he said it’s not a simple matter of saying that having counties categorized as having substantial spread should automatically trigger business closures.
 “Most of the spread we’re seeing cannot be traced to restaurants or small businesses,” Karamargin said.
 “Most of this traces to small gatherings of family and friends like the Thanksgiving holiday which was just two weeks ago,” he continued. And that, said Karamargin, is not a surprise.
 “People have been dealing with this the past nine months and are starting to let their guard down,” he said.
 “This is completely understandable,” Karamargin said. “Nine months is a very long time.”
 He also said rules that govern how businesses operate during the pandemic remain in place, including requirements for masks and social distancing. And Karamargin said the state has a “two-strike” rule: Businesses found to have violated those standards twice are shut down automatically and cannot reopen without permission of the health department.
 The issue of rising COVID cases and areas being classified as having substantial risk of spread is not confined to just those three counties.
 Pima County, for example, currently has all three categories in the substantial range. But only the case rate and percent positivity have been above the threshold for two weeks; a second week of COVID-19 hospital visits will put it in the same category.
 The situation is the same in Cochise County with two weeks of high cases and positive test results but just one week in the substantial range of that touchstone for hospital visits.
 Other counties are a bit farther away from the designation, with just two out of three measurements — cases per 100,000 and test positivity — in the red zone in Maricopa and Pinal counties but hospital visits still in the moderate range.

By June this year, public debt was standing at Rs35.107 trillion, while it was recorded at Rs32.197 trillion at the end of October 2019.
 The domestic debt rose 2.8 percent to Rs23.934 trillion; however, foreign debt
 fell 2.15 percent to Rs11.569 trillion, according to figures released by State Bank of Pakistan.
 The major increase in the public debt in the period under review came from the government’s domestic borrowing for deficit financing.
 However, the share of the government’s external debt continued to decrease.
 Zero fresh borrowing from the central bank compelled the government to rely on commercial banks for its financing needs. So, their contribution in the domestic debt remained higher.
 Budget deficit continued to rise despite a squeeze on defence and development spending. A sluggish growth in the tax and non-tax revenues led the increase in the budget deficit.
 The budget deficit in the first quarter of this fiscal year stood at 1.1 percent of gross domestic product or Rs484 billion, compared with 0.7 percent of GDP or Rs286 billion in the same period last year.
 The government has set a budget deficit target for FY2021 at Rs3.43 trillion or 7.5 percent of GDP.
 By and large, the pace of public debt accumulation showed a slowdown as utilisation of accumulated government deposits,
 lower revaluation losses, and higher debt servicing helped control the speed of debt buildup.
 The implementation of the G-20 Debt Service Suspension Initiative is likely to ease pressures on debt servicing and provide fiscal space to spend on social and health sectors.

The government and the opposition are at loggerheads with each other. It seems as if the political environment has reached the point of no return. The 11-party opposition alliance, the PDM, is reluctant to sit with the government for dialogue and demands for the resignation of the prime minister and seeks re-election. The government blames the opposition alliance for pursuing a foreign agenda to create political turmoil and instability in the country. The PDM is of opinion that the PTI-led incumbent government is a product of the highly controversial 2018 general elections. The government has replied to these allegations by saying that the PDM is conspiring to drag the country to a political crisis in order to weaken it economically and in other spheres. The PM has also asked the PDM to not hold public rallies due to a current surge in the spread of the deadly coronavirus across the country. On other hand, in Lahore, FIRs were registered against Maryam Nawaz and other PML-N leaders and workers over the violation of Covid-19 SOPs.

One of the facilitations offered by the government of Pakistan to the exporters is DTRE. The simple concept of this scheme is to allow the exporters to import inputs consumed in their exported goods at zero duty.
 The concept is attractive, but at the implementation stage the procedures are very cumbersome. The bureaucracy somehow managed to over-regulate the consumption of the imported inputs.
 It is worth noting that DTRE license or permission is granted for one year. All imports made under this scheme have to be consumed within a year.
 The inputs that are not consumed are then subjected to normal import levies plus some penalty.
 It is not as simple as it looks. The DTRE license is granted on the basis of last years' export performance (there is no concept of permission for additional growth in export).
 The exporter has to notify the revenue department about the order it has received from the buyer.
 The permission for inputs is granted on the basis of inputs to be used in each article as ordered by the buyer in the invoice.
 For instance, if there is an order for 100,000 men’s shirts and 100,000 trousers, both need the same inputs. The inputs are calculated separately.
 If the buyer, in the middle of the order asks to reduce the number of shirts to 50,000, and increase the quantity of trousers to 150,000, the exporter is not allowed to consume inputs imported for the shirts for producing trousers. This is because he has to put the inputs separately under DTRE.
 Another option is to seek permission to do so, which takes a long time. After the export order is executed and the inputs have to be accounted for to the regulator, the exporter is asked to pay the import duty for the 50,000 shirts that were not exported.
 The argument that the same were used in the trousers is not acceptable (as it is against the rules formulated by the bureaucrats).
 That is not all, the one-year license to import duty free inputs is not granted without hassle. The rent seeking cost is unaffordable for small exporters.
 Every change in invoice order needs permission that again has cost. The entire system is so cumbersome that only a few avail this facility.
 Similar facilities in India and Bangladesh are availed by almost all exporters (large or small). Before the introduction of DTRE the exporters were allowed to import inputs for export goods in bonded warehouses owned by them (usually in the manufacturing facility).
 That facility has not been withdrawn and is still available.
 Under the bonded warehouse scheme, the exporter has to apply for license to import inputs. It indicates the value of inputs for which the license is applied.
 The license is valid for two years. The exporter has to consume the inputs within that period and pay normal duties for unused inputs.
 There is no other restriction of using input for a specific order. The only expense of the exporter is the unofficial fee (over and above official fee) to expedite issuance of license.
 Interaction with exporters revealed that they shifted to DTRE in haste believing that it was a better facilitation, but the bureaucratic hurdles created in the scheme have made its use cumbersome.
 The old, bonded warehouse scheme is simple and the duration of license period is also longer (two years). Now most of the exporters are reverting back to this scheme.
 One wonders why the same facilities cannot be offered in DTRE. The exporter should be required to give documentary evidence of the use of imported inputs in the export order instead of allocating inputs for specific articles based on the export order received by the buyers.
 The undue ted tape has marginalised the small exporters that until now were the main export source. Now the export share of larger exporters is increasing and that of small exporters declining.
 Small exporters need hand holding by the government. They cannot afford to pay the ‘out of pocket expenses’ needed to secure a license for the bonded warehouse.
 It should be ensured that they are provided hassle free services by the government departments. Large exporters are operating at their full capacities, still the exports are not increasing at the desired pace (only two percent increase in the last five months of this fiscal).

PITTSBURGH (AP) — Six months working inside the confines that came with playing college football in the middle of a pandemic was enough for the Pittsburgh Panthers. Pitt removed itself from bowl consideration Friday, a day after finishing off the regular season at 6-5 following a 34-20 victory over Georgia Tech. The school became the second member of the Atlantic Coast Conference to opt out of the postseason, joining Boston College, which announced its decision Thursday. The Panthers voted to decline a bowl invitation if offered, a move that drew the full support of head coach Pat Narduzzi and athletic director Heather Lyke. Pitt players arrived on campus in early June and spent months getting tested three times a week while trying to abide by strict COVID-19 protocols, which included isolating themselves from their families. “Our football student-athletes’ sacrifice and commitment have been extraordinary,” Lyke said. “This season has been an especially taxing experience, physically and mentally, on and off the field.

The team voted to end its season instead, a decision athletic director Heather Lyke and head coach Pat Narduzzi said they fully supported.
 Boston College announced on Thursday it would not play in a bowl. The Panthers joined the Golden Eagles on Friday, citing the extraordinary efforts by the players over the last six months to play amid a pandemic.
 "Our football student-athletes' sacrifice and commitment have been extraordinary," Lyke said. "This season has been an especially taxing experience, physically and mentally, on and off the field. ... We are thankful and proud of how they handled the past six months and want them to have a well-deserved restful holiday season with their families and loved ones."
 Pitt's season was disrupted last month when the team's initial visit to Georgia Tech, scheduled for Nov. 14, was pushed back to Thursday due to a COVID-19 outbreak among the Panthers.

 Washington's NFL team says it is reversing course and banning fans from attending its last two regular-season home games because of the coronavirus pandemic.
 The club tweeted Friday that its games against the Seattle Seahawks on Dec. 20 and against the Carolina Panthers on Dec. 27 would be played without spectators.
 Washington's stadium, which is in Landover, Maryland, had been open to limited friends and family for games, then allowing up to 3,000 fans per game starting last month.
 But now the club says it "must remain diligent in protecting our staff, players, fans, and the community as the region continues its fight against COVID-19."
 Washington is 5-7 and in contention for the division title in the NFC East.

Programs aiming to nudge mini-grids to commercial viability must focus on identifying sites that can support higher load factors, work in tandem with programs targeting increased productivity at sites, and attract experienced developers who can procure equipment at global spot prices and deliver projects at lowest cost. However, there is a huge swath of communities where load factors are unlikely to increase, where incomes and commercial opportunities are too limited to yield much from demand stimulation efforts, and where local companies may deliver potential cost savings over international suppliers. Mini-grids could still be attractive, and a potentially least-cost solution for many communities.

A pilot who died in a military plane crash in Michigan's Upper Peninsula has been identified as Air Force Capt. Durwood "Hawk" Jones.
 The aircraft, a F-16 Fighting Falcon, crashed around 8 p.m. Tuesday. It was on a routine training mission with just a pilot on board, said the 115th Fighter Wing, a unit of the Wisconsin Air National Guard. It was assigned to the Truax Field Air National Guard Base in Madison, Wisconsin.
 The cause of the crash is still unknown and is under investigation. The 115th Fighter Wing had been conducting training flights throughout the week, which were set to run until 10 p.m. nightly.

Most mini-grid incentive programs in Africa are still in their early years, so it’s premature to draw final conclusions about their efficacy. That said, we thought it would be fruitful to take stock of where things stand. We studied 20 mini-grid programs in sub-Saharan Africa, 17 of which are currently being implemented. The findings of the full report are summarized below. The graphics include only those programs where data was available.

Our protocol for the past four months has become fairly standard, which includes remdesivir, steroids, low molecular weight heparin to prevent thrombosis, and oxygen--these are the four cardinal things. And this [should] remain more or less the same for the next two-three months. There is nothing else in the offing: Convalescent plasma has gone off [the protocol], and similarly, tocilizumab has gone off it. One of the reasons why tocilizumab has gone off is because of the serious infections we started seeing when we were using tocilizumab. So, after the trial said that tocilizumab doesn't help, we stopped using it.

After asking what he was being cited for, McGarry said he needed to call his friend and started walking away. He didn’t stop when ordered by the officer, according to the report.
 When an officer stepped in front of him, he made a quick “juke move” as if to take off running past her. At that time, the two officers each grabbed an arm to secure him in handcuffs so he wouldn’t try to walk or run away.
 As an officer reached for his handcuffs, McGarry pulled his right arm away breaking the grip on his wrist. He then tried to run north towards Court Street but the second officer still had ahold of his left arm.
 After grabbing him around his torso, the officer walked McGarry to the grass, took him to the ground, and both officers handcuffed him.
 While walking to the cruiser, McGarry attempted to dig his heels into the ground to stop his forward momentum, the report said.
 He was arrested for underage/under the influence, criminal trespass and resisting arrest. During the transport to jail, he banged his head on the plastic partition several times.

In reality, however, each wave of the pandemic within the United States has been a regional one. The first wave, in March and April, was centered largely in Greater New York and New England, among the locations where the virus first hit U.S. shores. The second wave, which peaked in July, most affected metro areas in the South and West, after many relaxed their social distancing measures just as the virus began to take root in their communities.

The two were actively involved in Brisa's life -- most notably through her swim team at Chandler High School in Chandler, Arizona. Tony served as president of the team's booster club, and Lisa helped out behind-the-scenes, said Rachel Tribby, vice president of the booster club.
 "(Tony) worked harder than everybody," Tribby told CNN. "(If) the event started at 5 p.m., he would be there at 5 a.m."
 She gave an example of how he'd always go the extra mile.
 Last year, the swim team hosted a huge invitational, with lots of officials and coaches. As the host team, Chandler High had to take care of them. And though they were trying to keep costs down, Tony still went all out.
 He brought a smoker, and he and the team's coach spent all night smoking a pork butt for the team and their guests. If that wasn't enough, he also brought mac and cheese and seven types of horchata, Tribby said.
