Health authorities are using a saliva test while working against a coronavirus outbreak in Australia’s second-largest city. The test appears to be less accurate than the nasal swab but is a more comfortable option. Victoria state Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton said the situation in Melbourne was “a genuine challenge now,” in part because the better situation elsewhere in Australia made it harder to tell people to stay vigilant. Victorian Health Minister Jenny Mikakos said on Monday that 75 people had tested positive in the state in the latest 24 hours. She said the saliva test was first used in a Melbourne suburban hot spot on Sunday. The saliva tests in research were only 87% as accurate as the nasal swab because saliva contained less virus than the throat, said Sharon Lewin, director of the Doherty Institute in Melbourne, which developed the saliva test being used.

The real winners of this collection are the women or men with small enough feet. Those who fit the bill will have the ability to purchase a pair of 1s that are reminiscent of 2019's Satin Black Toes remixed with a genuine leather snakeskin pattern. But the pair that most people will wish came in bigger sizes is the white and cement grey 3s with yellow detailing that Jordan has dubbed laser orange. To round out the woman collection is a heavily remixed pair of 6s with more materials then we can name and positive messages on the sock liner that read “Be Kind,” “Embrace Uniqueness” and “Spread Love.”

The Trump administration has lobbied for an expanded mission for the CIA- backed NDS and other militia forces to serve as a counterterrorism force that would keep Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS) and Al-Qaeda from gaining a foothold in Afghanistan once US and foreign troops completed their planned withdrawal in 2021. But the CIA has raised objections to such a plan, noting that the NDS and other CIA-controlled assets were completely dependent upon US military air power and other combat service support resources, and that any attempt to expand the CIA's covert army in Afghanistan following a US military withdrawal would end in disaster. Having the NDS fabricate or exaggerate detainee reports to keep the US engaged in Afghanistan is not beyond the pale.

Her cell-phone chat with garrulous BFF Dini (Marissa Anita) is interrupted when a previously noticed "creepy car" returns to give Maya the willies. Worse, its driver appears to know who she is, and things go downhill really fast when he exits his vehicle with machete in hand. By then the police have arrived, but before he's permanently halted, the stranger mentions the village Maya came from, and cryptically says "We don't want what your family left behind."

With both frameworks, I truly believe businesses can embrace the reset strategy and push their business forward. Execution is important, but not everything – it shouldn’t replace strategic thinking. The moment execution trumps all it will inevitably lead to a toxic environment and a culture that will forever be sitting on a shaky foundation. As the workforce leans towards autonomy, leaders need to change their style. When we tell people to do their jobs, we get workers. When we trust people to get the job done, we get leaders.

This year has thus far been quite challenging as we have been advised to stay home and social distance for many months now.


   


  Through it all, many developed a newfound or expanded interest in gardening, whether it involves beautifying with flowers and shrubs or growing vegetables for a healthy lifestyle.


   


  Gardening is a creative activity as much as it is practical. The practice of gardening may be indoors or outdoors, depending on one's inclination, resources, and space. Many find gardening relaxing and stimulating at the same time. Even those who have been gardeners for years find there is so much yet to learn and so many new plants to try. Maybe part of that manicured lawn can be transitioned to a butterfly garden, or some herbs and veggies can fit into the flower bed.


   


  If any of the above clicks with you, and you are interested in sharing your gardening interest with others, you may well be a candidate for Master Gardener certification.


   


  Penn State Master Gardeners are members of the community who not only have a passion for gardening, but also a desire to help others. What sets them apart from other gardeners is the intensive training in horticulture they receive from Penn State Extension. In exchange for their training, Penn State Master Gardeners serve as volunteers for Extension horticulture programs.


   


  In Beaver County, Master Gardeners create and maintain demonstration gardens; assist the public with gardening questions through a Garden Hotline; educate youth and adults about plants, insects, and the environment; teach pesticide education to first-graders; and, continue to learn and grow with evidence- based knowledge on sustainable horticulture.


   


  Certification as a Penn State Master Gardener requires a minimum of 40 hours of basic training and completion of 50 hours of volunteer service in the first year. Trainees must also do a small research project for presentation and pass a final exam with a score of 80 percent. Maintaining Penn State Master Gardener status after the first year requires at least 20 hours of volunteering on approved projects and a minimum of 10 hours of continuing education annually.


   


  Basic training for 2020-2021 will begin the last Thursday in September and continue through early March. Most classes are offered by statewide horticulture educators who deliver content through live Zoom webinars from offsite locations. If possible, some classes will be face to face when local experts are available and there will be hands-on activities to facilitate learning and interaction.


   


  Because we don't yet know what is in store for us this fall, we are planning to be ready with alternative modes of delivery. However, it will be important that prospective trainees have access to a computer for online webinars. A basic training fee of around $200 covers 18 weeks of classes; 700-page training manual; printing and program supplies; name badges; and IT support. Financial aid may be available.


   


  Class topics include communications; botany; plant propagation; soils; entomology; native plants; turf-grass management; vegetables; plant identification and nomenclature; small fruits; herbaceous plants; woody ornamentals; indoor plants; weeds and much more.


   


  For more information and an application, call 724-774-3020 or email vam5298@psu.edu. Join the Penn State Extension Master Gardeners of Beaver County Facebook page.

THE VILLAGES, Fla. (AP) — There has always been a low-boil tension between a much smaller cohort of Democrats and the Republican majority in The Villages retirement community in Florida. A veneer of good manners in the largest retirement community in the U.S. mostly prevailed on golf courses and at bridge tables. But residents said Monday those good manners have been put to a test over the past several months. Those tensions got international attention last weekend when President Donald Trump tweeted approvingly of a video showing one of his supporters at the retirement community chanting “white power,” a racist slogan associated with white supremacists.

Now something amazing has happened. Scotus has overturned the Louisiana restrictions on access to abortion once again, and justice Roberts voted with liberals. So people are going to think, oh. How is this possible? But I'm interested in your take on this, joy. Well, it's -- I'm thrilled for America. I mean, it's nice to see that Roberts is not a reactionary like some of the people on the court. He goes with precedent a lot. He sees that it's established law already and doesn't want to go crazy. It's just -- the interesting thing is, you know, you just don't know, you know, where they're going to go. Look at Gorsuch. People think -- thought he was going to be the biggest reactionary of all of them, and then he voted for gay rights in the workplace. It's kind of fantastic. You never know. I used to work with a guy who I thought was very cute and very hip, and then he started wearing French berets. You think you know somebody, and they start wearing a French beret. It reminds me of that. What do you think of this, sunny? Is this a -- is this a surprise or did you always know that, you know, most of the time the law is the law? Well, absolutely. I knew that, but Jeff toobin and I talk about this all the time, but I talk about this with my legal nerd friends. When judges get on the bench, especially the supreme court, they do surprise you. I think by and large many of them don't become these judicial activists the way people think that they do. They do respect precedent, and if you read this opinion, that is what justice Roberts said. He said he didn't think the Texas law that came before this should have been struck down, so that really is at his core, but because it had been struck down, he's going to abide by the precedent in that case. That's why he stuck with the majority of liberals in this not because he necessary believed that the abortion access shouldn't have been restricted, but because it was legal precedent. He stuck to the color of the law, but I think what's really interesting is, will this inure to the benefit of Donald Trump? Will conservatives now be very nervous and think, oh my gosh. I've got to vote for Donald Trump now because he's going to put more conservatives on the bench, and I think historically, you know, evangelical Christians were sort of that one-vote voter, single issue voters. They only were anti-abortion voters. I think times have changed. I think you'll see a lot of Democrats wanting to just defeat Donald Trump. They are those single- issue voters and I think you're going to find Republicans or those single issue voters that are thinking about racial equality. They're thinking about the coronavirus. They're thinking about the fact that there were bounties allegedly on our servicemen and women, and trump did nothing about that. So there are a lot of issues that people care about all wrapped up in defeating Donald Trump. So I don't know that this decision is necessarily going to inure to the benefit of Donald Trump anymore. Well, I just think that the idea of someone becoming chief justice turns -- turns them in a different way. They are to interpret the law and sometimes called upon to strengthen or weaken a law, and I think that their idea of what they are doing for the country, not how they feel personally, but what is right for the country. Now we have -- we have had several justices that, you know, just vote through party, but we're seeing maybe that those -- you can't depend on a person you think is conservative being a conservative in the midst of law, you know? They can personally be that, but not necessarily make the law work for them in that way, and,

Nelson has allowed just one hit in six innings. Spieker currently boasts a 1.05 ERA and 12 strikeouts while Holste, Kaufmann and Rich have also seen some time on the bump.


  In total, the Cougars have allowed only one earned run through the first six games.


  "We've got a deep pitching staff," Daugherty said. "Our pitching staff is probably the strongest part of our game so far. I've probably got four guys that could be our number one. If they can throw strikes, we are going to be a tough out."


  Daugherty feels his team will have to continue their strong pitching performances if they want to continue the success they have had.


  "In the long run, we're going to have to continue to throw strikes," he said.


  The Cougars have four games over the next four nights against Boyer Valley, Orient-Macksburg, Exira-EHK and Southwest Valley and will finish their regular season slate with contests against Woodward-Granger, Underwood and Audubon. Daugherty hopes his team can use their rigorous schedule at the end of the season as a primer for the postseason, where they have lofty goals.


  "We want to make a deep postseason run," he said. "We're going to be tested right before tournament time and I hope that does us some good. Hopefully that pays off for us."

Measures to cope with the surge and to plan for its peak were evident over the weekend at Methodist, which called nurses to work extra shifts, brought new laboratory instruments on line to test thousands more samples a day and placed extra hospital beds in an empty unit about to be reopened as patients filled new coronavirus wards.


  Gov. Greg Abbott, speaking in Dallas on Sunday, said the virus had taken a “very swift and a very dangerous turn” in Texas and the increase in the rate of positive coronavirus tests, to over 13% in the past month from less than 4%, was an “alarm bell.” He made the grim assessment after meeting with Vice President Mike Pence and Dr. Deborah L. Birx, the coordinator of the White House’s coronavirus task force, who joined the governor in urging all Texans to wear masks and avoid close contact in crowds.


  Pence, appearing at a Dallas rally celebrating religious freedoms, threw his support behind Abbott and his efforts to reopen the state’s economy — even as the governor made an about-face on Friday in his phased plan by ordering bars closed and capacity at restaurants cut. Many young people had socialized in them, standing close together, not wearing masks, some expressing skepticism that they could become infected.


  During the virus’ first peak in April, the majority of patients testing positive in the Methodist hospital system were older than 50. Now the majority are, like Estrada, relatively young. Nearly one-third of intensive care patients are now under 50, much higher than in the initial coronavirus surge.


  The stress on medical institutions burst into public view last week, when Texas Medical Center — a downtown cluster of Houston’s major public and private hospitals, including Methodist — announced that the baseline intensive care unit capacity across its hospitals was full, with 28% of beds occupied by virus patients. That was nearly twice a threshold established by the state, which called for ICUs to have a maximum 15% of virus patients for hospitals to resume elective services.


  The hospitals typically operate with nearly full ICUs, and had planned to increase the number of critically ill patients they could treat. But the next morning, the governor issued an executive order that again restricted elective surgeries in Harris County. The order, however, allows hospitals to continue performing surgeries and procedures that will not deplete their capacity to care for coronavirus patients; some hospital executives and doctors, including ones at Methodist, said they were able to continue providing those services, which they viewed as particularly needed after being halted during the initial shutdown. The Texas Medical Center hospitals are collectively treating about 1,500 coronavirus patients, according to figures released Saturday.


  During the previous surge in mid-April, Methodist’s system had at most just over 200 coronavirus patients. On Sunday, it had nearly 400 inpatients with the virus, and about 150 more were being tested for it. Some models predict a peak in two to three weeks.


  Roberta L. Schwartz, an executive vice president and chief innovation officer at Methodist, who is serving as the coronavirus incident commander, walked from unit to unit on Saturday “trolling for beds,” as she described it. She spoke with nurses and doctors, troubleshooting to solve problems that could delay sending patients home or transferring them to lower levels of care when they were ready. She informed nurses in an intermediate care unit that it would soon transition into an ICU for coronavirus patients.

Bahujan Samaj Party is not a toy in the hands of either Congress or BJP, BSP supremo Mayawati said on Monday even as she reiterated her support for BJP in the issue of border tension between India and China, at the same time alleging that blame game between Congress and BJP over Indo- China was sidelining other important issues like fuel price hike. Her statement in a press meet she held after many months in a bid to clear the air, came two days after Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra had made a veiled attack saying some opposition leaders had become BJP's undeclared spokesperson . She also said members of BSP should be wary of such statements and reports that may mislead them. She also said both central and state governments should monitor and not just publicise the many schemes they have announced for the welfare of the people as they are not reaching the intended beneficiaries. It is an old allegation that when Congress is at the centre, BJP says BSP has become a toy in its hands and similarly when BJP is at the centre, Congress says it has become a toy in BJP's hands. I want to tell both Congress and BJP that BSP is not a toy in the hands of either the BJP or the Congress. It is a national level independent party and also, it is foremost a movement, then a political party, Mayawati said. Whenever matters of national interest are raised, we have supported both the Congress and the BJP , rising above party lines and we will stand with the BJP in the India- China issue, she said. However, Mayawati did take the opportunities to take further digs at Congress saying the BSP was formed when the Congress was ruling at the centre and in most states and if they had worked for the welfare of the minorities and the downtrodden, there was no need for a party like BSP. She further said migrants who now came back in large numbers had moved out at the time of Congress' rule in many states because it could not give them employment. She said Congress was overthrown because they were unable to implement policies and BJP should learn from their failure and make sure its policies are implemented well. At the same time, she attacked both the BJP ruled central government as well as opposition Congress saying, it was because they were locked in a blame game over the Indo-China issue that other important issues like fuel price hike were being sidelined, which will ultimately make the public suffer. In a statement she also fleetingly touched upon the jobs scheme announced by UP CM Yogi Adityanath on Friday that claims to provide jobs to 1.25 crore people. She said that while a lot of schemes have been launched both by the centre and different states, the benefit.

Hi everyone! We look forward to the Fourth of July this weekend because it makes for a long weekend as well as fireworks, picnics, and family gatherings.  


  Through the hundreds of years since we declared our independence and became our own sovereign nation, much has changed. Even today, we are adapting to many situations and my prayer is we as a nation become stronger with them.  


  The following quotes by President Ronald Reagan have a lot of profound messages and I hope each of you will take the time to read them and think about what these statements really mean to you.  


  "I believe this blessed land was set apart in a very special way, a country created by men and women who came here not in the search of gold, but in search of God. They would be free people, living under the law with faith in their Maker and their future."  


  "Our liberty springs from and depends upon an abiding faith in God."  


  "The truth is, politics and morality are inseparable, and as morality's foundation is religion, religion and politics are necessarily related. We need religion as a guide."  


  "If we lived by the Golden Rule, there would be no need for other laws."  


  "I believe with all my heart that standing up for America means standing up for the God who has so blessed our land. We need God's help to guide our nation through stormy seas. But we can't expect Him to protect America in a crisis if we just leave Him over on the shelf in our day-to-day living."  


  "My fellow citizens, those of you here in this hall, and those of you at home. I want you to know that I have always had the highest respect for you, for your common sense and intelligence and for your decency. I have always believed in you and in what you could accomplish for yourselves and others.  


  And whatever else history may say about me when I'm gone, I hope it will record that I appealed to your best hopes, not your worst fears, to your confidence rather than your doubts. My dream is that you will travel the road ahead with liberty's lamp guiding your steps and opportunity's arm steadying your way.  


  My fondest hope for each one of you, and especially for the young people here, is that you will love your country, not for her power or wealth, but for her selflessness and her idealism. May each of you have the heart to conceive, the understanding to direct, and the hand to execute works that will make the world a little better for your having been here.  


  May all of you as Americans never forget your heroic origins, never fail to seek divine guidance, and never lose your natural God-given optimism.  


  And finally, my fellow Americans, may every dawn be a great new beginning for America and every evening bring us closer to that shining city upon a hill…My fellow Americans, on behalf of both of us, goodbye, and God bless each and every one of you and God bless this country we love."

  As we enter the month of July, my hope is everyone will stay vigilant concerning the pandemic we are now faced with and probably will be for some time. We have heard yea and nay on wearing face masks, social distancing, and washing our hands hundreds of times.  


  There is no quick fix for this situation and good old common sense needs to be applied for it. If you are unsure about your safety, take those extra precautions and if you feel sick, stay home.

"We've really limited our strikeouts," Daugherty said. "We're putting the ball in play and trying to get the barrel on the ball and hit it hard. We've got some guys swinging it well."


  Sophomore Joe Kaufman is currently hitting .647 in 17 at-bats this season and has driven in nine runs. Daugherty attributes Kaufman's early successes to the offseason work he put in.


  "He's been out with PEAK Performance in Council Bluffs, so he's had a few more cuts than everyone else," Daugherty said. "When the season took off, he was hitting line drives everywhere. He's been a pleasant surprise."


  Senior Kolby Nelson is currently hitting .471 with six RBI. Cade Ticknor has driven in a team-high 10 runs and is batting .438. Colby Rich, Lane Spieker, Jacob Holste, Connor McKee and Ben Tibken have also been key cogs in the Cougars' lineup.


  The pitching has been almost as impressive as the offense.


  Ticknor -- this week's Jim Hughes Real Estate KMAland Athlete of the Week -- has tossed 14 innings, allowing only six hits and zero earned runs while striking out 13.


  "He just throws strikes," Daugherty said. "He's got a good curveball. He can throw it no matter what the count is. He's throwing the ball hard."

  So Newton can look to the Tannehill saga as a best-case scenario after apparently folding in what otherwise was a fruitless free agency market and signing such a cheap contract with the Patriots.

A few days after buying a sweater at Macy's, Erin Chisman returned to get the same one in a different color, only to realize it was 50% off. Upon seeing the new price tag, the Wisconsin-based business owner was determined to save.


  So she turned to the cards in her wallet. "I looked at my terms and I noticed that it did have price protection," she says. "Within three days, I had a check in the mail" for the $30 difference.


  Price protection, a benefit that refunds the difference of a lower advertised price, has largely vanished from many credit cards in recent years -- but plenty of other side perks remain, and your card may even have added some new ones. Here's what to know about these benefits so you don't miss out.


  BENEFITS ARE NOT ALL CREATED EQUAL


  If you don't know all the perks your card offers, you're not alone. Only 36% of cardholders reported fully understanding their supplementary benefits, according to J.D. Power's 2019 Credit Card Satisfaction Study.


  It can be hard to keep track because offerings vary widely, depending on both the credit card's issuing bank (American Express, Chase, Citi, etc.) and, often, the payment network on which it runs ( Visa, Mastercard, AmEx or Discover).


  But if you spend some time with your card's terms and conditions -- or with a customer service rep online or by phone -- you can learn your card's benefits and how they can help. Consider some of these examples and the potential savings they offer.


  CELLPHONE PROTECTION


  A credit card's cellphone protection benefit can cover a stolen or damaged cell phone up to several hundred dollars per claim. To qualify, you'll have to pay the monthly phone bill with the eligible card, and an out-of-pocket deductible typically applies.


  Chisman relies on cellphone protection offered through her business credit card to avoid paying the cell phone company for coverage on four employee phones at her music school. "The savings there (are) between $20 and $40 per month," she says.


  If your card's coverage is primary, it means you don't have to involve your own insurer. If it's secondary, it may supplement what your insurer doesn't cover.


  EXTENDED WARRANTY PROTECTION


  A card's extended warranty protection may prolong an original manufacturer's warranty, sometimes a year or longer, depending on the terms. Regardless of your purchase, the savings can add up.


  According to a 2018 survey by Consumer Reports, the median price for an extended warranty on a major appliance was $131. For a small appliance, it was $19, but either way it's money that your credit card can save you.


  Some cards have stopped offering this benefit in recent years, but those that have it usually cover what's included in the original manufacturer's warranty. To qualify, the product must be purchased with the eligible card. Exclusions may apply for some products like cars and computer software.


  RETURN PROTECTION


  When a retailer's return policy fails, this credit card benefit may refund you the amount of the purchase. Only certain products qualify, and you'll have to act within a certain window to file a claim.


  Shipping the item to an assigned address and paying for the postage out of pocket may be required. Read the fine print to determine whether it's worth it for you.


  PURCHASE PROTECTION


  It's disappointing when a new item is damaged or stolen, but less so if you've paid for it with a credit card that offers purchase protection. This benefit has also been phased out by some issuers, but it's not extinct.


  Depending on the terms, the item will be replaced or repaired, or you'll be reimbursed up to several hundreds of dollars per claim if filed within the required time frame.


  The process generally requires documentation, which may include a credit card statement, a receipt and other information.


  EXCLUSIVE DISCOUNTS


  Depending on your credit card issuer, you might also qualify for exclusive cardholder discounts. Some Mastercard World Elite cardholders, for example, can get $5 off every Postmates purchase of $25 or more (not including delivery fees, tips and taxes).


  And eligible American Express credit cards provide a complimentary ShopRunner membership that offers free two-day shipping. Terms apply.

Infuriated by Taylor’s death and that of George Floyd in Minneapolis, thousands of Louisville residents have joined the national protest movement against police brutality and racial injustice.


  Anger spiked again in Louisville early this month after David McAtee, 53, a Black man, was shot to death by police officers enforcing a curfew.


  McAtee, reportedly, had shot a gun as officers fired pepper balls to disperse people gathered near his barbecue restaurant. According to family members, McAtee was defending his niece. Surveillance camera footage appears to show that she was nearly struck by a pepper ball just before McAtee fired.


  All of these events seemed almost far-fetched as my family and I enjoyed Louisville over the weekend. We spied some Black Lives Matter yard signs and references to Taylor in shop windows and on business marquees. And we saw boarded-up windows here and there.


  But few people were out and about, and the city seemed peaceful, almost sleepy. Many, we assumed, were still self-quarantining because of the pandemic. Some, we reasoned, were discouraged by the 90-degree heat.


  We enjoyed a late dinner Saturday night at Harvest Restaurant near downtown, blissfully unaware that a mile away, at Jefferson Square Park near downtown, violence had flared.


  A man standing on the perimeter of the park had fired more than a dozen shots into a crowd of people who had gathered to demand justice for Taylor.


  A 27-year-old white resident of Louisville, Tyler Gerth, was killed and another person was hospitalized. Details of what happened at Jefferson Square were still emerging Sunday.


  Saturday’s shooting happened about 3 miles from Muhammad Ali’s grave and just two blocks north of a Louisville thoroughfare named for him.


  Much has changed since Ali protested the war in Vietnam and helped lead the movement in the 1960s to empower Black people.


  As recent events in his hometown have illuminated again, there is much yet to be changed.

Fishermen around the world logged about 6.8 million hours at sea from March 11 to April 28, down about 700,000 hours from averages the previous two years, according to data compiled by Global Fishing Watch. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations said the pandemic has brought “changing consumer demands, market access or logistical problems” that could keep fishing difficult indefinitely.


  The time spent with boats docked was much more severe in countries such as Italy, Spain and France, which suffered large virus outbreaks, Kroodsma said. Fishing in those countries was down 50% to 75%, he said.


  Fishing dropped off because of concern about spreading the virus on boats and because of decreased demand for seafood. Two-thirds of the U.S. seafood spending is in restaurants, according to a study in the June 2020 journal Nutrients, and thousands of those remain shuttered by social distancing rules.


  As a result, some fishermen are bringing less catch to the docks so far this year. The American catch of Atlantic herring was down more than a fifth — almost 3 million pounds (1.4 million kilograms) — through the end of May, according to federal statistics. Herring is a key species because it's used as human food and as bait for more profitable fisheries, such as lobster.


  None of this necessarily means fish populations are rebuilding, said Gavin Gibbons, spokesman for the National Fisheries Institute trade group. American fisheries are managed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and the plans to help species recover can be highly technical and take years to implement, Gibbons said.


  “It's much more specific than just give fish a break and they'll rebuild,” he said.

Some lenders don't even offer a co-signer release. If that's the case, the student will have to refinance the loan to be able to remove you as a co- signer -- and that's no walk in the park, either. Refinancing a loan is basically taking out a new private loan to pay off your original loan, and so the primary borrower will have to meet the lender's credit requirements to get approved without needing a co-signer. Besides this, there's a chance that they'll end up paying more in the long run if they can't secure a lower interest rate.

  This year has thus far been quite challenging as we have been advised to stay home and social distance for many months now.


  Through it all, many developed a newfound or expanded interest in gardening, whether it involves beautifying with flowers and shrubs or growing vegetables for a healthy lifestyle.


  Gardening is a creative activity as much as it is practical. The practice of gardening may be indoors or outdoors, depending on one's inclination, resources, and space. Many find gardening relaxing and stimulating at the same time. Even those who have been gardeners for years find there is so much yet to learn and so many new plants to try. Maybe part of that manicured lawn can be transitioned to a butterfly garden, or some herbs and veggies can fit into the flower bed.


  If any of the above clicks with you, and you are interested in sharing your gardening interest with others, you may well be a candidate for Master Gardener certification.


  Penn State Master Gardeners are members of the community who not only have a passion for gardening, but also a desire to help others. What sets them apart from other gardeners is the intensive training in horticulture they receive from Penn State Extension. In exchange for their training, Penn State Master Gardeners serve as volunteers for Extension horticulture programs.


  In Beaver County, Master Gardeners create and maintain demonstration gardens; assist the public with gardening questions through a Garden Hotline; educate youth and adults about plants, insects, and the environment; teach pesticide education to first-graders; and, continue to learn and grow with evidence- based knowledge on sustainable horticulture.


  Certification as a Penn State Master Gardener requires a minimum of 40 hours of basic training and completion of 50 hours of volunteer service in the first year. Trainees must also do a small research project for presentation and pass a final exam with a score of 80 percent. Maintaining Penn State Master Gardener status after the first year requires at least 20 hours of volunteering on approved projects and a minimum of 10 hours of continuing education annually.


  Basic training for 2020-2021 will begin the last Thursday in September and continue through early March. Most classes are offered by statewide horticulture educators who deliver content through live Zoom webinars from offsite locations. If possible, some classes will be face to face when local experts are available and there will be hands-on activities to facilitate learning and interaction.


  Because we don't yet know what is in store for us this fall, we are planning to be ready with alternative modes of delivery. However, it will be important that prospective trainees have access to a computer for online webinars. A basic training fee of around $200 covers 18 weeks of classes; 700-page training manual; printing and program supplies; name badges; and IT support. Financial aid may be available.


  Class topics include communications; botany; plant propagation; soils; entomology; native plants; turf-grass management; vegetables; plant identification and nomenclature; small fruits; herbaceous plants; woody ornamentals; indoor plants; weeds and much more.


  For more information and an application, call 724-774-3020 or email vam5298@psu.edu. Join the Penn State Extension Master Gardeners of Beaver County Facebook page.

Just when winter was finally slipping into the rearview mirror, Les Harrison of Olney was about to enjoy a fishing trip to Florida. Then, the world turned upside down.


   


  Suddenly, medical facilities built to handle heart attacks and strokes were face to face with a mysterious pandemic, the likes of which hadn't been seen for a century in the United States. As the director of Plant Services at Carle Richland Memorial Hospital (CRMH), it was his job to help keep everyone safe.


   


  Over the next six weeks, he and his dedicated team raced to create several negative pressure environments throughout the hospital to help prevent the transmission of COVID-19. Negative pressure is an isolation technique that prevents cross contamination between rooms by using special filters and fans to draw air into one location and vent it safely outside. It was an ambitious undertaking, but with the help of generous philanthropic support from local residents, Harrison soon had everything needed in place.


   


  Since the pandemic started in February, Carle Center for Philanthropy has received nearly $7,000 to assist CRMH with preparedness, containment and response efforts at the local hospital.


   


  "We're so grateful for the generosity of these donors and their desire to keep our Olney team members, patients and community safe during this pandemic," said Beth Katsinas, vice president of Carle Center for Philanthropy. "Covering the costs of this important project is just one way our donors are making a difference at Carle Richland."


   


  "One of the first things we needed to do was set up an area to receive patients in our emergency room," Harrison said.


   


  Working together with the ER nurse manager, they quickly found a location and installed a portable high-efficiency filtration unit strong enough to create negative pressure to the corridor.


   


  Next it was on to the Family Maternal Services department (FMS) to ensure that any mothers with COVID-19 could give birth in a safe environment.


   


  "The last thing we wanted to do was move things into our FMS unit where we may have some cross contamination," Harrison.Fortunately, they were able to use the old unit and delivery room nearby to set up shop.


   


  "Those rooms are already equipped with the medical gasses and lights that are needed, so it made it the ideal place to do that," said Harrison. With the help of a contractor, they drilled through the masonry wall and installed another filtration unit, creating a safe space for new deliveries. The newly converted space also provided a place for gastrointestinal procedures, keeping the operating room available for other needs.


   


  With a few local supplies, several portable units and physical labor, they soon had the hospital in great shape.


   


  "The nice thing with the high-efficiency filtration units is that we'll be able to use those for whatever we may need in the future," Harrison said.


   


  In total, the hospital purchased four new filtration units and four shutter- type exhaust fans with donations. Currently, these units and fans are being deployed to the hospital's intensive care, medical surgery and the medical surgery overflow units, as well as the long-term care unit on the third floor.


   


  "This pandemic has reminded us why it's so important to have world-class healthcare close to home," Katsinas said. "If you've never made a financial donation to support your local Carle hospital, now is the time." Visit carle.org/give to make a secure, online donation to Carle Center for Philanthropy. Donors may choose to direct their gift to Carle Richland Greatest Need or Carle Hospice - Richland.

CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. (WVIR) - Without an extension on Governor Northam’s eviction moratorium, Virginia may soon be facing a homeless crisis.“I think if you put it in context with the 2008 mortgage crisis, you’re talking about something much bigger than that,” Public Housing Association of Residents (PHAR) Organizer Brandon Collins said.Rent relief programs are crucial to being able to prevent an eviction crisis. Collins said that such programs are in the works, but organizations like PHAR need more time to put them in place.“The city is rolling out a program, hopefully that will be ready next week and then the state is providing funding for rent relief through the Thomas Jefferson planning District Commission,” Collins said. ”Hopefully that’s enough funding to get a start on things.”Collins also says there are resources available for people who may be facing eviction soon The city of Charlottesville has a hotline people can call for help with rent. He also urges people to know their rights and to never go into court without a lawyer.In the Charlottesville area, if the moratorium isn’t continued the fallout could be drastic.“The impact in Charlottesville is going to be huge,” said Collins. “Housing is already unaffordable for most people in the community and for them to find new housing will just be impossible and we’ll be faced with a massive homeless crisis.”Collins also asks for landlords to be good community partners and to not send residents to the streets immediately.“The bad landlords should not move forward with evictions,” said Collins. “I’m sorry, they need their money, we’ll make sure they get it somehow but it’s not being a good community partner putting anyone in the streets right now.”Earlier this week, Governor Ralph Northam announced that he would leave it to localities courts to extend the moratorium if they choose.Copyright 2020 WVIR.

The Canadian province of Alberta, home to the world's third-largest oil reserves, said on Monday it will cut its general business tax rate to 8 per cent from 10 per cent and invest $10 billion in infrastructure projects as it seeks to jump start an economy badly damaged by the coronavirus pandemic.


  Premier Jason Kenney, who said the tax cut would take effect July 1, described the program as the largest infrastructure investment in Alberta's history.


  Economic shutdowns due the virus outbreak added to challenges in the oil-rich province from lower crude prices and pipeline congestion, pushing the unemployment rate as high as 25 per cent, Kenney said.


  "Given the severity of the economic crisis, we must act now," he said during a press conference.

The Supreme Court’s decision to strike down a Louisiana law restricting access to abortion provides the strongest indication in years that Roe vs. Wade __ may survive, and that women will continue to have access to safe, legal abortions. The court, in a 5 to 4 decision, declared unconstitutional a Louisiana statute that required doctors performing abortions to have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles.


  By itself, this decision is unremarkable. Four years ago, in 2016, the court declared a nearly identical Texas statute unconstitutional in Whole Women’s Health vs. Hellerstedt. The larger significance of this case is to be found in Chief Justice John Roberts casting the fifth vote to invalidate the law based on the importance of following precedent.


  In the last decade, many states have adopted hundreds of laws — often targeting providers and clinics — seeking to restrict abortion. Some, like Alabama’s, would prohibit all abortions. Others, like laws prohibiting abortions after a fetal heartbeat is detected, such as in Iowa and Ohio, would forbid abortions after the sixth week of pregnancy and effectively prohibit most abortions.


  The question up to now had been how the court would deal with these laws, and even whether it might overrule Roe vs. Wade, in light of its newest justices. In 1992, when the court reaffirmed Roe vs. Wade in Planned Parenthood vs. Casey, Justice Anthony Kennedy was the fifth vote for the majority to continue constitutional protection for abortion rights. Likewise, in 2016, Kennedy was the fifth vote to strike down the Texas law in Whole Women’s Health v. Hellerstedt. Now Kennedy is gone, replaced by Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch.

The survey also showed that the main reason why Indians loved PUBG was that it was better than other available games while some respondents admitted that they decided to give the game a try because everyone was talking about it.

In 2014, Louisiana enacted a law that requires abortion providers to maintain admitting privileges at local hospitals. Had the Supreme Court not struck down this law today, Louisiana would be left with, at most, two physicians at only two clinics across the state who could provide abortion services, despite the fact that roughly 10,000 women obtain abortions in Louisiana each year. Louisiana’s admitting-privileges requirement was identical to a Texas statute that was invalidated and found to be unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in _Whole Woman’s Health v. Hellerstedt_. Earlier in the case, the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Louisiana granted a permanent injunction against implementation of the Louisiana law, but, in 2018, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed that decision. June Medical Services and two physicians appealed the decision to the Supreme Court, which granted an emergency application to stay the law from taking effect, pending the outcome of the appeal.

Summer Under the Stars is the work of Bourbon Cowboy Owner Susan Brinkman.
 “We were visiting with folks from the VFW earlier during lockdown, as other fundraisers were being canceled, and decided that when restrictions were lifted we would hold something outside,” Brinkman said.
 The idea to show an outdoor movie was popular but it took some time to figure out the logistics. After some research and discussion, Brinkman reached out to the Emporia Masons about setting up in their parking lot.
 “It’s the darkest lot in town,” Brinkman said. “And it’s 12,000 square feet, so we had plenty of room to spread out and observe social distancing. The Masons are very philanthropic; they came on board as a co-sponsor and we put the rest together from there.”
 Gates opened at 8 p.m. with limited admittance to ensure people had enough room to stay six feet apart. A DJ kept the music pumping before the movie, Bourbon Cowboy set up a beer tent and Brian Mosiman set up his Grab-n-Go hot dog stand with made to order hot dogs available for purchase.
 Post Commander Mike White said he appreciated Brinkman and the event’s other sponsors choosing to support the local organization as leadership works to revive VFW Post 1980. The VFW set a $75,000 campaign goal, which would cover the amount of debt owed and allow the post to work on some updates and restorations. Several planned events and fundraisers were canceled earlier this year, slowing progress on the post’s goals.
 “We’re working hard to keep everything running and the bills paid,” White said. “We’ve been slow to make headway because of COVID-19 [shutdowns] but people have stepped up to help.”

BUDAPEST, Hungary - Two Dutch men have been sentenced to five years in prison for selling drugs at a popular Budapest music festival last summer, a Hungarian court ruled Monday


  Prosecutors had recommended prison sentences of up to 10 years and appealed the court’s decision, seeking longer prison terms. The court ruling also included four-year bans from Hungary for both men once they complete their prison terms.


  According to a statement from the Budapest chief prosecutor's office, the men, both 23, admitted their guilt at Monday's preparatory court hearing and renounced their right to a trial.


  They were arrested in August, when police found 20 kilograms of pre-rolled marijuana cigarettes and ecstasy pills with a street value of around 100 million forints ($315,000), most of them in a small van the men were using which was parked outside the festival grounds

Perhaps because Roberts’s key vote was so clearly compelled by the nearly identical nature of the laws in question in the two SCOTUS cases, this decision could theoretically keep open the feasibility of some other kind of TRAP laws in the future. But it’s unlikely that Republican state legislatures can get another, stronger case before SCOTUS quickly enough to mitigate the impact of two consecutive decisions blocking TRAP laws. And if Roberts is unwilling to reverse _Hellerstedt_ , he certainly cannot be expected to go further down the road to the reversal of _Casey_ and _Roe_ that the anti- abortion movement wants, and that nearly all Republican politicians in Washington and around the country support.

Henry County (Tennessee) Sheriff's deputies found a toddler locked inside a 4-by-4 foot cage and surrounded by animals, bugs and filth when they responded to an animal-cruelty call on Thursday, Sheriff Monte Belew said.


   


  Among the animals in the room with the child was a non-poisonous snake that was about 10 feet long and a foot in diameter, Belew said.


   


  "It could've easily suffocated that child if it got a chance," he said.


   


  The child, who is thought to be about 18 months old, appeared uninjured but was obviously hungry, Belew said. A deputy at the scene cared for the toddler until the Department of Children's Services took custody of the child.


   


  Adults at the home, including some of the toddler's relatives, were accused of a variety of crimes including aggravated child abuse and animal cruelty along with drugs and weapons violations.


   


  "It was heartbreaking to see the conditions this child was living in," Belew said. "There was nothing for that baby in the entire house outside of the cage he was in. All his toys were in there with him.


   


  "There were no other toys, no crib, no blankets for him. It appeared he spent most if not all his time in the cage, and the ammonia smell that came up when we lifted the cage and the bugs that were under it makes it appear as if he stayed in there a lot."


   


  Deputies were called to a trailer in Buchanan on Thursday after an anonymous tip alerted authorities to possible animal cruelty on the property, Belew said.


   


  Investigators found chickens roaming the yard that weren't being cared for when they first entered the property, Belew said, and they went on to find snakes, dogs locked in cages and more than 500 mice, rats and hamsters.


   


  "We don't know what purpose mice, rats and hamsters were serving - they could've been food for the snakes or they could've been for sale purposes - but this was definitely an unusual situation," Belew said.


   


  He added that the occupants of the home reacted in a way that they couldn't believe law enforcement would be in their home mandating how they live.


   


  "I'm all for you living your life how you see fit, because we're free to do that," Belew said. "But the conditions of this home were definitely out of the norm, and the child and the animals needed to be removed from the area."


   


  The animals were taken to different veterinarian clinics for checkups before being taken to rescues.


   


  Belew said the rest of the place was in a state of disarray with garbage and old food scattered all over the place.


   


  "There was trash and food on top of the cage (where the child was held)," Belew said. "And you can tell when a child is starving and hungry, and he was starving.


   


  "He needed to be out of there, and the animals did, too."


   


  Henry County sheriff's deputies arrested three adults living in the home - 42-year-old Heather Scarbough, 46-year-old Thomas Jefferson Brown and 82-year- old Charles Brown - on allegations of aggravated child abuse, aggravated cruelty to animals, possession of firearm in felony, manufacturing marijuana, possession of drug paraphernalia and cruelty to animals.


   


  Thomas Brown is also charged with a count of felon with possession of a firearm from a past conviction in Florida.


   


  Belew said more charges and more counts of each charge could be possible pending the continuing investigation.

Health authorities are using a saliva test while working against a coronavirus outbreak in Australia’s second-largest city. The test appears to be less accurate than the nasal swab but is a more comfortable option. Victoria state Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton said the situation in Melbourne was “a genuine challenge now,” in part because the better situation elsewhere in Australia made it harder to tell people to stay vigilant. Victorian Health Minister Jenny Mikakos said on Monday that 75 people had tested positive in the state in the latest 24 hours. She said the saliva test was first used in a Melbourne suburban hot spot on Sunday. The saliva tests in research were only 87% as accurate as the nasal swab because saliva contained less virus than the throat, said Sharon Lewin, director of the Doherty Institute in Melbourne, which developed the saliva test being used.

_June Medical Services_ v. _Russo_ was universally regarded as the best opportunity anti-abortion advocates had to give a green light to states that sought to shut down clinics via Targeted Regulation of Abortion Providers (TRAP) laws purported (disingenuously) to protect the health of women seeking abortions. What stood directly in the way, however, was the Supreme Court’s 2016 decision in _Whole Woman’s Health_ v. _Hellerstedt_ _,_ in which it struck down a virtually identical Texas law. But the Court was configured differently four years ago. Since that 5-3 decision — the vacancy created by Justice Antonin Scalia’s death had not yet been filled — one of the majority in the case, Justice Anthony Kennedy, retired, and two new justices, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, were nominated by Donald Trump, who has vowed to use his appointments to end abortion rights. So by simple arithmetic, it seemed like the Court would reverse or somehow distinguish _Hellerstedt_ , so long as it could overcome the embarrassment of changing directions so quickly on the hottest constitutional issue of all.

The Lady Jaguars will more than likely enter the 2020-21 season as the team to beat in the 13th Region but a later start to any type of workouts, combined with no summer basketball games being played, could play a role in how things pan out in the long run for Mahan's young but talented squad.


  "I know expectations are high for our program but we may very well have the youngest team in the region," Mahan said. "Missing summer ball for many years would not have been as big of an issue as it is this year. The valuable experience these kids were going to be able to get in a much less pressure- filled environment was going to be very important for this year's team.


  "With the youth of our team, and losing two important players like Isabel Gray and Gracie Jervis, we have a lot of questions about our lineups and roster for this upcoming season," he added. "I typically answer many questions about our team during summer ball and it gives me a clearer picture for the season and now we will be having to figure those things out on the go this year. It may very well change how smooth the start of our season will be."


  With his team just recently being allowed to work out, Mahan admitted it's great for everyone involved.


  "Just being able to be together and focus on improving is important," he said. "It had to be a tough decision to make eliminating this year's dead period but I believe the KHSAA made the right one after our kids have been stuck at home for over three months. I just hope all coaches are truly understanding with kids who have plans during this time. Family time and vacations are vital to kids as well."


  The COVID-19 pandemic also forced high school basketball coaches to either cancel or postpone their youth camps. The pandemic could also play a role in the basketball program's ability to fundraise compared to past years.


  "I will always figure out a way to fund the things we need, so missing camp isn't about the money we missed out on," Mahan said. "Youth camp, after some down years previously, was huge last year and we heard so many positive things that came out of it. Youth camps help improve your future players' skill level while also exciting them about the sport and our program. To me, it is a huge building block to our program that we missed out on. I hope to have some minicamps in the fall on Saturdays to help make up for the missed experience this summer.

That new world centres around COVID-19, which is forcing the Canadian screen industry to rethink operations both in front of and behind the camera. Instead of tight huddles, productions will now have fewer face-to-face interactions, reduced crowd scenes, and more outdoor locations. That's on top of the usual pandemic measures of extra handwashing, sanitization, physical distancing and personal protective equipment.


  "I really hope that the past philosophy of 'There are no sick days in show business' is something that everyone really thinks long and hard about," says Winnipeg producer Kyle Irving, who plans to roll cameras on the feature film "Esther" in August.


  "Because as far as I'm concerned, we can't live by that philosophy anymore. If someone's not feeling well, they need to stay home for their own good, and for the good of those people they work with. So that's going to be a change in how we do things in this business. But we must make that change."


  As some provinces start to ease pandemic restrictions on productions, producers are now working with government, guilds and unions to create proper health and safety guidelines for reach region.


  Irving co-authored COVID-19 film and TV protocols for the province of Manitoba. They include certified training programs for crew; staggered meal times and a ban on buffet-style eating; limited interactions with the general public; an online platform for all paperwork; and suggested limited filming days of 11 shooting hours plus setup and wrap time.


  Employers are encouraged to have a zero tolerance policy, where employees and contractors who do not abide by all of the safety and health guidelines at all times can be terminated.


  "We're doing it carefully and cautiously," says Irving, a partner at Eagle Vision whose other producing credits include the series "Burden of Truth."


  "We're just not going to be able to move as fast as we used to, and we're certainly not going to be able to be on top of each other the way that we used to in this business. It's going to be a different way of thinking."


  Producer Tom Cox — whose series include the Alberta-shot "Wynonna Earp" and "Heartland," and the upcoming Vancouver-shot "Family Law" — says they're also "going to be extremely conservative and careful."


  "I think everyone realizes that there's a level of responsibility that has not existed before — individual responsibility, group responsibility," says Cox, who is based in Calgary.


  "We're going to have to really live responsibly on and off set to ensure that not only production can resume, but production can be completed."


  The COVID-19 film and TV protocols for Manitoba and Ontario have various protocols for dealing with someone who is showing symptoms, but don't state that the production needs to shut down entirely.


  Other suggestions in Ontario's health and safety guidelines, which were just published last week, include avoiding open casting calls, limiting in-person auditions, and doing remote casting.

Both the flaps and the landing gear were retracted. One propeller blade was bent slightly aft; neither blade exhibited leading edge damage or chordwise scratches. Both the left and right fuel filler caps were secure and intact. Both fuel tanks were undamaged, and each contained about three ounces of fuel.

As Oliver points out, while evictions have been placed on hold, that measure only covers physically removing tenants from their homes. The federal moratorium on evictions—which only applies to about 25 percent of cases to begin with—allows the legal process of eviction proceedings to move forward as normal. The fact that those proceedings are sometimes conducted over Zoom because it’s not considered safe for people to leave their homes only underscores the possible consequences of people being turned out onto the streets en masse. The state and federal protections put in place at the onset of the pandemic are beginning to expire, and without them, Oliver warns, the coronavirus crisis could evolve into a terrible new phase. (Warning: He illustrates this point with a graphic of the Pokémon Mr. Mime topped with Kevin Spacey’s head.)

PORTLAND, Maine (AP) — Commercial fishing taking place worldwide has dipped since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, but scientists and conservation experts say it's unclear if the slowdown will help endangered species of marine life recover.


  Hours logged by fishermen at sea fell by nearly 10% around the world after the March 11 declaration of a pandemic, and in some hard-hit countries such as China, fishing completely stopped. The fishing decline has spurred questions about food security, ocean management and global trade.


  As countries begin to resume fishing, new questions are emerging about whether an extended fishing slowdown could help rare ocean animals, such as the North Atlantic right whale. The whale numbers only about 400 and is vulnerable to fatal entanglement in fishing gear.


  Less fishing could also help jeopardized fish stocks of the Mediterranean Sea, which is home to the overfished Atlantic bluefin tuna. And many rare species are vulnerable to accidental catch, called bycatch, in fishing gear.


  But it's too early to hail the respite from fishing lines and nets, said David Kroodsma, director of research and innovation for the nonprofit Global Fishing Watch. And since millions of people rely on fishing for their livelihoods and sustenance, any benefit to sea life has come at a cost, he said.


  “I don’t think we should be celebrating anything here. Not by making people suffer incredibly,” Kroodsma said. “I bet what we’ll find is, it is not sufficient for rebuilding stocks in places they have to rebuild.”

There are plenty of good reasons to house your retirement savings in a Roth IRA, but if you're hoping for immediate tax savings, a traditional IRA is the way to go. What sort of savings might you be looking at? Say you're under 50, and so the maximum amount you can contribute toward last year's IRA is $6,000. If you put in that full amount and you fall into the 22% tax bracket, you'll shave $1,320 off your 2019 tax bill. And that way, you get the best of both worlds -- money earmarked for retirement that you can invest and grow, and immediate tax savings that will either cause you to owe the IRS less, or put a bigger refund in your pocket.

Vedanta Ltd. has sought permission from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) to take up maintenance work at the Sterlite Copper plant in Thoothukudi, which has been shut down for two years now.


  In a letter written to the Board, the company’s Chief Executive Officer Pankaj Kumar said due to the lack of maintenance, there was a risk to the factory. Load bearing structures, acid tanks, pipelines and ducts, molten metal handling equipment, cooling towers, boiler panels and conveyor systems required regular maintenance to prevent corrosion, he said.


  “We spend almost ₹200 crore annually on plant maintenance. A Local Monitoring Committee appointed by District Collector, Thoothukudi, earlier only permitted us to remove stored copper concentrate, rock phosphate, furnace oil, phospho gypsum and other such materials from the factory. However, our requests for care and maintenance of the facility have been continuously denied,” he pointed out.


  Moreover, due to the sudden shutdown of factories in light of the lockdown, there were multiple reports of industrial accidents across the country. They emphasized the point that chemical and metallurgical plants required regular maintenance. The absence of regular maintenance may lead to serious incidents affecting employees, the community and ecosystem, Mr. Kumar added.


  The company said the CPCB could first ascertain the plant’s condition by way of an inspection before issuing any orders.


  The plant had been shut down and sealed by the TNPCB in May 2018, which had been challenged by the company before the National Green Tribunal, which subsequently was heard by the Supreme Court by way of an SLP and civil appeal. The matter was brought back to the Madras High Court, which in turn heard it and reserved orders in January.

According to the memo, SEPTA would run the program, which is designed to “promote traffic safety and accessibility and reduce congestion.” If enacted into law, the measure would also allow SEPTA to be compensated for running the program. Money from the program would go toward small-business grants in the city.


  White could not immediately be reached for comment, but officials from the city’s Office of Transportation, Infrastructure, and Sustainability (oTIS) are on board with the plan, though it would require City Council approval once it passed in the state legislature. Transportation officials are eyeing Chestnut and Market Streets and Roosevelt Boulevard in the future as places for the enforcement.


  The city recently launched an automated camera enforcement program on Roosevelt Boulevard using speed cameras at select intersections to improve safety.


  City transportation officials say such a program for bus lanes can help improve transit equity.


  “Automated enforcement reduces the interaction of police and communities while also assuring that people who ride buses, including people of color and low-income customers, have better access to jobs and other destinations,” said Michael Carroll, oTIS deputy managing director and a SEPTA board member.


  Recently, the city launched a pilot program that provided designated loading zones on Chestnut Street to increase bus speeds and reduce traffic congestion.


  The city released a report on its findings from the pilot and found median midday travel times dropped by 19% between 22nd and Broad streets, and illegal parking and loading that blocked lanes was reduced. Still, city officials suggest automated camera enforcement “will improve bus service on Chestnut Street by providing consistent enforcement when needed most — when a vehicle is blocking the bus.”


  “We see buses stuck in traffic, and when we try to make it better, like on Chestnut and Market … there’s some engineering things we can’t do,” said Chris Puchalsky, director of policy and strategic initiatives for oTIS.


  SEPTA and the city also conducted two enforcement blitz programs between 2018 and 2019. Andrew Busch, spokesperson for the transportation authority, could not provide numbers for the second, but the first iteration of the blitz improved bus travel times by 6% on Chestnut Street river to river during midday hours.


  Busch said the enforcement would continue improvements and complement the authority’s upcoming comprehensive bus network redesign. Officials are currently evaluating proposals for a three-year contract to redesign the bus system.


  “We certainly think it’s something that, moving forward, would benefit SEPTA and our riders looking to get through some congested areas in Center City in a more efficient way,” Busch said.


  New York City’s Metropolitan Transportation Authority implemented bus-mounted cameras on 123 buses across three routes. Last October, transportation officials kicked off the program on the M15 bus route, which runs on First and Second avenues in Manhattan.


  The MTA reported two months later that bus travel times increased up to 34% on some segments. Wait times also improved, with about 77% of buses showing up within three minutes of their scheduled times during peak hours and five minutes during non-peak.


  Fines, issued after a 60-day warning period, range from $50 to $250 within a 12-month period.


  The MTA’s system uses both pole-mounted and bus-mounted cameras, a system Puchalsky said would be ideal for a robust system. But Busch said there is no determination yet what SEPTA will use.

This year Valley ATV, a Polaris and Can-Am Dealer located in the rural hill country between Loudonville and Danville, is celebrating its 26th year in business.  


  From its beginnings as a one-man operation in a pole barn on his family farm, Paul and Mary Lou Staats have overseen the growth of the dealership into the largest in Ohio and among the top 10% nationwide.  


  Valley ATV started selling Polaris equipment in 1994, and added Can-am in 2003. Polaris, based in Minnesota, and Can-am, in Quebec, Canada, are both manufacturers of all-terrain vehicles and side-by-sides.  


  "The industry has changed a great deal over the past 16 years," Mrs. Staats explained. "Polaris came out with their Rangers in 1999, giving the customer easier on and off capabilities and a dump bed to haul things, assisting owners in doing their jobs. Rangers can also easily haul up to six people.  


  "Then in 2008 Polaris added the Razor, a unit that provides a fun new ride and the ability to carry up to four people comfortably.  


  "In 2013 Polaris introduced the Brutus, a Ranger type side by side with a diesel engine designed primarily for commercial use--but also sold to homeowners. Owners have the option of a Brutus with PTO equipment. Also hot off the assembly line is the new Polaris Ace,  


  introduced in 2014, a single-passenger vehicle with a bucket seat, steering wheel, and roll cage."  


  Cam-am followed the side-by-side market in 2011 with the Commander," Mrs. Staats continued. "The Commander can carry two persons comfortably, and they followed it with release, in 2012, with the Maverick, a high-performance side- by-side.  


  "Both companies offer vehicles with 1,000cc engines and Turbo available. New for Can-am, in 2016, is the Defender, a UTV vehicle with bench seat, giving customers four models to choose from.  


  "The ATV market is still strong for both companies for trail riding as well as light utility work and plowing," Mrs. Staats said.  


  Valley ATV now has 15 employees and a two-story showroom, with most employees family and committed to providing a friendly, courteous shopping experience.  


  The staff includes six full time mechanics, three salesmen, two parts clerks and an office staff of four.  


  Mechanics are certified and can provide service for all makes and models of ATVs. The service area is being expanded, and the firm offers the commitment to provide parts to customers, both what they want and when they need it. Online orders of parts and accessories can be made at www.valleyatv.com  


  Valley ATV is open 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. Monday and Wednesday; 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Tuesday, Thursday and Friday and 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. Saturdays. It is closed Sunday, and will be closed on all major holidays, and take long weekends for Memorial Day, Fourth of July and Labor Day, and will be closed the entire week between Christmas and New Year's.  


  Valley ATV is located on Jelloway Road in Scenic northern Knox County, north of Danville and south of Loudonville.

Did Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu just resurrect the issue of Palestinian statehood?


  This after months of carefully assuaging those on his Right by assuring them that this Palestinian statehood was not under consideration now as Israel moves forward with US President Donald Trump's peace plan.


  Yet those who know English and who happened to be awake at about 3 a.m. Israel time Monday, would have heard Netanyahu make his most clear link to date, between Palestinian statehood and the Trump peace plan.


  In a prerecorded English statement to the annual Christians United for Israel conference, Netanyahu stated: "The President's vision finally puts to rest the two-state illusion, it calls for a realistic two-state solution."


  One could almost hear his settler and right-wing opponents jumping up out of their beds and collectively shouting; "Gotcha!"


  From the moment the Trump peace plan was unveiled in Washington, the most startling element for the right-wing and the settlers has been the sudden inclusion of a two-state solution, precisely at the moment when they were certain that Trump and his administration had put the entire idea to bed.


  For three years the words "Palestinian state," barely passed the lips of US officials, who used creative linguists gymnastics just to avoid those two words.


  Then in January the Trump administration published a peace plan, which according to a count by Binyamin Regional Council head Israel Ganz, mentioned a Palestinian state 159 times.


  Netanyahu, US officials and the Israeli supporters of the Trump initiative have done their best since to focus on the plan's unique sovereignty offer, but to no avail.


  In each and every juncture, the plan's opponents have heard only two words, "Palestinian state."


  In a video Ganz published this month against the plan the settler leader noted that for a document which is purportedly about sovereignty, it barely speaks of it, mentioning the word only seven times.


  That kind of linguist omission has played to the fears of the right-wing and settler opponents of the plan, who have learned the hard way, that peace processes often go down in flames, but still leave an indestructible mark on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict when it comes to Palestinian statehood.


  The 1993 and 1995 Oslo Accords never lead to a peace agreement. But it did create a Palestinian government, the Palestinian Authority, with its own security forces. The Oslo Accords also carved up the West Bank into three distinct sections of which 40% of the territory now known as Areas A and B, were placed under the auspices of the Palestinian Authority. Effectively it created a de-facto Palestinian state, without ever offering peace.


  The unilateral 2005 Israeli civilian and military withdrawal from Gaza, also never brought about the desired peace, but did enable a Hamas takeover of the Strip, effectively splitting the Palestinian territories into two de-facto states.


  So when the Trump plans speaks of Israeli sovereignty over 30% of the West Bank within a process for a two-state solution, many on the Right see a map for Palestinian statehood over 70% of the West Bank.


  It's a map that in their minds could only lead to a terror state in their heartland.


  Almost every day in the countdown to annexation, the Right has published videos and campaign ads with one clear message; "no" to a Palestinian state.


  True they have concerns that the sovereignty plan has hidden settlement freezes and evacuations built into it, but their leading concern, has most assuredly been fear of Palestinian statehood.


  So much so, that it became clear early on that Netanyahu could not possibly pass the Trump plan in it's entirety neither in the government nor in the Knesset.


  Netanyahu has already clarified that should the matter come to a vote, he would only put forward a sovereignty plan. Likud politicians, such as coalition chairman Miki Zohar have attempted to do damage control and sworn that Netanyahu would not support a Palestinian state.


  Netanyahu himself has spoken prior to his Sunday night address US time, mostly of his commitment to negotiations with the Palestinians on the basis of the Trump plan; but has been quiet on statehood.


  He has allowed his support for a Palestinian state to be presumed, or he has relied on his 2009 Bar-Ilan address when he said that he supported a demilitarized Palestinian state.


  On Sunday night, however, Netanyahu pushed back at his opponents on the Right by challenging their understanding of Palestinian statehood.


  He carved out a position on the matter, that hit at both the international opponents of the Trump plan and the right-wing ones.   Since the publication of the Trump plan, the international community and much of the Israeli left, have opposed the "Deal of the Century" primarily on territorial grounds; its failure to set the borders of a two-state solution at the pre-1967 lines.


  The international argument is that there is common agreement that these lines are the boundaries of the two-state solution and that anything which deviates from that, is a departure from a common understanding of the conflict held by all parties, including by Israel.   But with the exception of a brief period under former Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, no Israeli leaders has ever agreed to that principle. If anything, they have been concerned that such a boundary would pose an existential threat.


  The Oslo Accords did not hold Israel to that geographic boundary and former US president George Bush promised Israel that inclusion of Israeli settlement blocs could be considered in any resolution to the two-state solution.


  True the United Nations has long spoken of the pre-1967 lines as the boundaries of the conflict, but the Israeli Right has increasingly made the argument that such a UN designation does not take into account international agreements on Jewish rights to the West Bank territory, which predate the UN.


  This one simple argument over the territory - whether the two-state resolution should be at the pre-1967 line or not - has so overwhelmed the conflict that scant attention has been paid to the multi-faceted issues that would need to be resolved for a two-state solution to be successful.


  The sanctity of the pre-1967 lines, based on arbitrary 1949 armistice lines, has been so ensconced in the dialogue around the resolution to the conflict in the last two decades, that scant attention has been paid to the complex multi- faceted factors that would determine the success or failure of any agreement.


  Less talked about are the other conditions for the success of a two-state solution, which is heavily dependent on the ability of a Palestinian state to be democratic and desire to live in peace with Israel.


  From the Clinton administration to the Obama one, the importance of this aspect of Palestinian statehood has been spoken of, but none of the plans have emphasized it as heavily as Trump.


  It is almost as if, according to the international community all Israel has to do is to withdraw to the pre-1967 lines and peace would suddenly descend, like some Biblical prophecy where the lion lies down with the sheep, while doves flutter above.


  It is this "illusion" which Netanyahu referenced in his Sunday night speech. Israel Ambassador to the US Ron Dermer simply outlined this difference between an illusionary two-state resolution and a realistic one in an opinion piece he published in The Washington Post earlier this month.


  When the Trump plan speaks of a Palestinian state, it lays out conditions such as democracy, an end to incitement against Israel as well as a cessation of its diplomatic warfare against the Jewish state. It also calls for the Palestinian state to respect religious freedom, end corruption and ensure judicial independence among other things.


  Most significantly it allows for Israel to maintain security control over all the territory in the West Bank and the Jordan Valley.   For the Right opponent, the choice is clear, a terror state or no Palestinian state. But supporters of the Trump plan, including Netanyahu and a more moderate Right, including some settler leaders, the equation is different.


  They see the choice as one between a western style Palestinian state and the continuation of a Palestinian entity that financially supports those who engage in terror activities against Israel. It is an entity which they fear could at any time be taken over, by more radical forces.


  For the Palestinians the notion of anything less than the pre-1967 lines has been a non-starter, because they fear it is territorially unviable. For both the Palestinians and the international community, it is Netanyahu's words that are illusionary.


  But the dialogue to date on Palestinian statehood, has been an argument between the moderate and less moderate Right both in Israel and in the United States.


  It is in a debate between those two camps, that Netanyahu has now tried to paint a vision of an illusionary and a realistic Palestinian statehood.

A US congressional committee investigating police actions in a park near the White House has been told the "attack" on an Australian TV news crew was unlawful.


  Seven Network correspondent Amelia Brace and cameraman Tim Myers were in Washington DC's Lafayette Square on June 1 covering protests when Park Police began aggressively clearing the area.


  The protests followed the Minneapolis police arrest death of George Floyd.


  Brace and Jonathan Turley, a law professor at George Washington University Law School, testified before the US House Committee on Natural Resources on Monday.


  Brace told the committee she was shot in the legs and backside with non- lethal rounds from a police automatic weapon and hit with a truncheon.


  She said Myers was shot, punched and struck with a police riot shield.


  "I think that attack was unlawful," Turley told the hearing.


  "From the video it seems clear to me that any officer could have seen that the Australian journalists were in fact journalists.


  "They identified themselves correctly as journalists.


  "I thought I saw media credentials on them, but also they knew there were journalists in the area.


  "This one doesn't strike me as a very close call."


  The police clearing operation came ahead of the arrival of US President Donald Trump in Lafayette Square for a photo opportunity outside St John's Episcopal Church holding a bible.


  Brace and Myers were broadcasting live back to Australia when riot police began forming a line in front of them, before they charged at protesters and media members.


  "When you were attacked by this police officer, were you resisting?" Democrat congressman Ruben Gallego asked Brace.


  "No," she replied.


  "Was your cameraman resisting?" Gallego asked.


  "No," Brace replied.


  "You had your back to them, as I remember, and you were fleeing?" he asked.


  "That's correct," she replied.


  Brace told the committee it was imperative for democracy that journalists were allowed to safely report from the scenes of protests.


  "As a reporter I have no interest in becoming the story, but over recent weeks many of us have been left with no choice," she said.


  "I've been shocked to see how many journalists have been attacked, beaten and detained, just for doing their jobs.


  "Covering protests does carry unavoidable risks, but the media's role is essential.


  "We don't just have a right to be there, we have an obligation.


  "As Australian journalists we are the eyes and the ears of our people.


  "In this case witnessing civil unrest in the capital of our most powerful and closest ally.


  "It is crucial to democracy that journalists be allowed to do their job freely and safely and that is certainly something we should expect in the world's greatest democracy."

Ronald Kuhn   June 12, 2020   After 81 gratifying years of life, Ronald Henry Kuhn passed peacefully from our embrace on June 12, 2020. Ron was a lover of life, travel, fine wine, animals, and, of course his lovely wife of 50 years, Deanna. His early roots were in both Germany and California. Much of his education was acquired in Germany leaving him with a lifelong appreciation for travel and exploration. His 4 years in the Air Force and his career as a federal contract administrator provided additional opportunities to fulfill his dreams not only professionally but also personally in his marriage and friendships.   Upon his retirement, the beauties of the Willamette valley called him and Deanna to settle in Eugene. Here they hiked many trails, planted grapes, made wine and many friends who shared their love of this life in the beautiful northwest. His retirement also allowed Ron to indulge his lifelong love of oil painting and nature in all it's forms, especially his ready smile for all animals.   Ron is survived by his sisters-in-law, brothers-in-law, his nephew, and many nieces who will always cherish their memories of him. For Deanna and Ron, their's was a love story from beginning to end, and she will love him forever.   In light of Ron's sensibilities please make any memorial donations to Greenhill Humane Society or the ACLU.   Please sign the guest book at www.registerguard.com/legacy
