Kanoute then came up trumps both tournaments’ deciders, scoring in the all- Spanish affair against Espanyol (ended 2-2 after extra time) and just about tucked away his penalty in the shootout success.


  In the domestic cup final against Getafe, he kept his composure to score early on for Sevilla to win the club the trophy for the first time since the late 1940s.


  Meanwhile, Drogba was also enjoying his first prolific campaign at Chelsea helping the Blues to domestic cup success against Arsenal in the League Cup and Manchester United in the FA Cup.


  The latter was particularly predictive of a love story with the New Wembley, as he scored in two other deciders in 2010 and 2012 at the Home of Football.


  The Ivorian scored 33 times in 60 games, a goal every 1.8 matches, while the Mali star’s tally of 28 came in 45 fixtures at a slightly better ratio of 1.6 while being equally decisive in the big games like his counterpart.

The 27-year-old star is on loan at Reading from Beijing Renhe until the end of the season.


  “Following Saturday's announcement by the government to allow elite sporting events to return behind closed doors, the EFL has this weekend agreed to a provisional restart date of the weekend of 20 June 2020 for matches in the Sky Bet Championship,” an EFL statement read.


  “After discussing various approaches and the importance of completing the season in a similar timeline to that of the Premier League to avoid any potential issues with promoted and relegated clubs, the Sky Bet Championship season is set to conclude with the Championship play-off final on or around 30 July 2020.”


  EFL Chair Rick Parry said the matches will perhaps resume behind closed doors. Reading players had started their training from May 25 at Bearwood Park.


  “With Sky Bet Championship Clubs set to return to full-contact training later this week and following Saturday’s Government announcement, we are edging closer towards resuming the 2019/20 EFL season. We have therefore today consulted with the Board’s Championship Directors and agreed to fixtures restarting behind closed doors on 20 June,” Parry said.


  “Whilst matches will, unfortunately, have to take place without supporters, we are working with our broadcast partners, EFL Championship Clubs and all relevant stakeholders to broadcast the remaining 108 games plus Sky Bet Championship Play-Offs.


  Parry hinted the date mentioned is subject to further amendments based on recommendations from health institutions.

The shootings happened as people were protesting the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis but it wasn't clear whether the shootings occurred at actual protest scenes.
 Demonstrators have been rallying for days across the country over the death of George Floyd, who was seen on video pleading that he couldn't breathe with a white police officer pressing his knee into his neck for several minutes before he stopped moving.
 Police in Vegas said Monday that 338 people were arrested during three nights of demonstrations. Officers used tear gas and pepper balls to disperse crowds late Saturday downtown and Sunday on the Las Vegas Strip.
 Police said suspects were jailed despite a local court policy calling for most people accused of misdemeanor crimes to receive court summonses instead of time behind bars to help prevent the spread of the new coronavirus.

It all segues easily into his next transatlantic crossing in the _Small World_ which just happened to be a hydrogen balloon. A trip he made with my mother and two others. Again, they left from the Canaries but eventually had to ditch after 94 ½ hours aloft. He describes landing in the sea at 30 ft/s vertically and the same speed longitudinally as ‘like a fairground ride’. But since he had designed the gondola they happily sailed the rest of the way (1500 nm) to Barbados. It was ‘not a catamaran but a W shaped hull made from polystyrene foam with a terylene skin’. I push him on this – this is terylene the same as sails are made from and polystyrene the same as packing foam. The terylene was specially coated to take adhesive to hold it onto the foam. The mast was made by Jack Holt (the dinghy man) and carried a Ljungstrom double sail. He mentions sail trials in the Solent, after a launching in the Lymington River where onlookers thought it might be a prototype dustcart for the river. It had a leeboard, a rudder – but to keep her balanced at sea, they had to place two people on either side of the centreline so no there was no ‘rafting’ (he uses his hands to show what happens when a raft tips over too far). Patrick Ellam asked to join but there was, unfortunately, no space.

Iowa State football has landed one of its top remaining 2021 recruiting targets.
   
 Jaylin Noel, a 5-foot-11 slot receiver out of Park Hill High in Kansas City, Missouri, announced his commitment to the Cyclones via Twitter on Sunday. He had narrowed his choices to a final two of Iowa State and Nebraska, but he also held offers from programs such as Iowa, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Kansas and Kansas State.
   
 The 247Sports Composite gives Noel three stars and ranks him the No. 136 receiver in 2021. Rivals also gives him three stars.
   
 Noel is another recruiting victory for Iowa State receivers coach Nate Scheelhaase, who attended high school at Rockhurst in Kansas City, Missouri.
   
 According to his 247Sports profile, Noel logged 42 catches for 769 yards and nine receiving touchdowns, as well as 45 rushes for 251 yards and three scores.
   
 Iowa State was his first Power Five offer last June. He then unofficially visited for the Cy-Hawk game on Sept. 15, and he took another visit this past February. In late April, he announced a final two of Iowa State and Nebraska.
   
 Noel is Iowa State's 14th recruit in the 2021 class. He is the second receiver, joining Canada product Tristan Michaud.

The islands of La Gomera, El Hierro and La Graciosa have received official clearance to move to Phase Three of Spain's lockdown de-escalation measures, and it is reported the larger islands that make up the chain – including Gran Canaria – could move out of Phase Two next week.


  Ramirez believes such easing in social distancing measures will make it possible for fans to attend Las Palmas' first match of the resumed 2019-20 Segunda Division season.


  "The Las Palmas fans will be able to attend the stadium to cheer on their team from June 13 against Girona," he told the club's official radio station.


  "The Canary Islands is a safe destination. Gran Canaria is a safe destination. We can become the only stadium in the major leagues to play again with fans in the stands."


  Spain was one of the worst-hit countries in Europe by the pandemic, but strict lockdown measures and a staggered release of those restrictions across autonomous regions has helped to keep infection and death rates under control in recent weeks.


  La Liga is due to resume with the derby match between Sevilla and Real Betis on June 13, although all games in the top flight are expected to be behind closed doors for the foreseeable future.


  On Sunday, La Liga confirmed the schedule for the rest of the league season, with Barcelona playing Atletico Madrid on July 1 in one of the standout fixtures.


  A number of top players from the division have outlined their excitement about the action getting back underway, including Real Madrid's Marcelo.

At a news conference earlier Monday, Brown said she would send in 100 state police from across Oregon to assist the city, and activate 50 Guard soldiers to work behind the scenes.
 “You don’t defuse violence by putting soldiers on the streets,” the Democrat said.
 In Minneapolis, meanwhile, Floyd’s brother Terrence made an emotional plea for peace at the site where Floyd was arrested.
 “Let’s switch it up, y’all. Let’s switch it up. Do this peacefully, please," Terrence Floyd said as he urged people to stop the violence and use their power at the ballot box.
 Also Monday, an autopsy commissioned for Floyd’s family found that he died of asphyxiation from neck and back compression, the family’s attorneys said.
 That distinguishes it from the official autopsy, which said he died from the effects of being restrained along with underlying health problems and potential intoxicants in his system. The official autopsy found nothing “to support a diagnosis of traumatic asphyxia or strangulation.”
 The second autopsy was done by a doctor who also examined the body of Eric Garner, a New York man who died in an officer’s chokehold six years ago.
 The family has accepted an offer from former boxing champion Floyd Mayweather to pay for Floyd’s funeral and memorial services, according to the CEO of Mayweather Promotions.
 Authorities in many cities have blamed the violence on outside agitators, though have provided little evidence to back that up.
 But on Monday, federal authorities arrested a 28-year-old Illinois man, Matthew Lee Rupert, saying he had posted self-recorded video on his Facebook page last week that showed him in Minneapolis handing out explosive devices and encouraging people to throw them at law enforcement officers. The video also showed him attempting to light a business on fire, and looting, according to an FBI affidivit. Early Sunday, he posted more videos of himself in and around Chicago, saying “let’s start a riot.”
 He was arrested in Chicago for violating the city's curfew.
 More than 5,600 people nationwide have been arrested over the past week for such offenses as stealing, blocking highways and breaking curfew, according to a count by The Associated Press.
 Police officers and National Guard soldiers enforcing a curfew in Louisville, Kentucky, killed a man early Monday when they returned fire after someone in a large group shot at them, police said. In Indianapolis, two people were reported dead in bursts of downtown violence over the weekend, adding to deaths recorded in Detroit and Minneapolis.
 While police in places tried to ease tensions by kneeling or marching in solidarity with the demonstrators, officers around the country were accused of treating protesters with the same kind of heavy-handed tactics that contributed to the unrest in the first place.
 Cities struggled to keep police in line.
 In Fort Lauderdale, Florida, an officer was suspended for pushing a kneeling woman to the ground during a protest. In Atlanta, two officers were fired after bashing in the window of a car and using a stun gun on the occupants. In Los Angeles, a police SUV accelerated into several protesters, knocking two people to the ground.
 In New York, the police commissioner said about six incidents were being investigated by the department’s internal affairs bureau, including a weekend confrontation in Brooklyn in which two police vehicles appeared to plow through a group of protesters. In another incident, an officer pointed a gun at protesters, drawing condemnation from the mayor.
