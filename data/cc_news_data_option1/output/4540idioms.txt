“I think we’ve seen a lot of changes in the city,” he continued. “If you poll the council, they’ll all tell you that housing is our number one issue. Housing stock in Austin is not up to par; we have too many rental houses and we have too many low-value houses that people don’t take care of. We’ve built a lot of apartments; that’s been our number one priority. I think the biggest criticism I’ve received from people is high taxes for the last four years. They have been a little bit high, but most of it goes into trying to improve our housing stock and trying to get people here and stores here. That’s what people want. I don’t think people elect you and say, ‘I want low taxes and nothing else.’ They put you in there to take care of the city to the best of your ability. I’m a moderate income person; I make no more than most people, and I think that’s important because I feel the pain just as much as everybody else when things go up. But we’ve done a good job. The Hormel Institute has had two expansions and the city has had a big part in that.”

The State government has provided administrative sanction to release ₹15 crore for shore protection measures for the coastal area between Fort Kochi and Chellanam.
 Repair works on seawalls along the coast in South Chellanam, Gunduparambu, Malakhappadi, Bazaar, Velankanni, Chalakkadavu, Kandakkadavu, Reethalayam, Puthenthode, Kannamaly, Cheriakadavu, Kattiparambu, Manassery and Saudi that have been damaged over the years will be taken up immediately.
 The government nod for the sea protection measures came in the wake of a blueprint for action submitted by the Kerala Region Latin Catholic Council to the government, said Shaji George, convenor of the council, here on Saturday.
 He said both Care Chellanam, a voluntary organisation working for the uplift of people in Chellanam, and Coastal Area Development Agency for Liberation (CADAL) under the KRLCC had submitted a memorandum to the government on various issues related to shore protection in Chellanam. CADAL had stated that sea erosion experienced in Chellanam was a fallout of the constant dredging for maintaining the shipping channel for the Kochi port and suggested that materials dredged from the area should be deposited along the coast to help reduce the effect of erosion.
 The other suggestions included use of man-made structures such as tripods to protect the coast as granite boulders were no longer an option due to their scarcity. Restrictions on granite quarrying had resulted in paucity of the material in the recent past.

But perhaps the most depressing artistic cul-de-sac of the past four years was the yearning turn back toward a vanished present amid the ascendance of white, neoliberal feminist leadership: Meg Wolitzer’s “The Female Persuasion,” and still more on the nose, Curtis Sittenfeld’s “Rodham,” a novel written as the memoirs of President Hillary Rodham in the present day. After a passionate courtship with Bill Clinton, Hillary becomes fed up with his infidelity (and the whispers of graver misconduct) and leaves him before they even get married. She goes on to have a sober, serious career as a law professor, becomes a senator for Illinois, and then runs for president in 2016 — against tech billionaire Bill Clinton, whose political career exploded before he could become president in the ’90s. Trump appears as a minor character, a possible spoiler in the race who instead chooses to publicly back Hillary Rodham.

A questo punto a Trump non restano molte alternative, sempre se si rimane nel campo della legalita.

Dichiarazioni, comunque, da irresponsabile, tenuto conto della situazione. Il dire, infatti, che «ogni voto legale deve essere contato e ogni voto illegale non deve essere contato» e una banalita, visto che c'e una procedura  molto rigida per garantire l'integrita del processo elettorale e finora non c'e alcuna prova che sia stata manomessa. In ogni caso non e il presidente che decide quali voti sono legali e quali no, anche se Trump vorrebbe dichiarare legali i suoi consensi e illegali quelli di Biden.

 Ikhimnwin, Robinson and Williams were unable to help the Lions to a historic win on their recent European adventure.

My grandfather, who made a good living as an independent milkman, buying wholesale from a local dairy, then delivering to scores of commercial and residential customers, maintained a house on Coolidge Avenue in Syracuse and also a homestead in the nearby hamlet of Fabius, that had been awarded to Hugh’s great-grandfather, as a bounty land grant for his service in the American Revolution.
 For a boy, it was a kind of paradise. My father spent his summers ranging through the hills and fields of rural Onondaga County and fished for trout in Butternut creek. During the school year, he played in the rough and tumble streets of Depression-era Syracuse and attended Most Holy Rosary (not just Holy Rosary, Jack, but Most Holy Rosary) from kindergarten through his senior year in high school.
 The area was so overwhelmingly Irish that in the traffic light at the bottom of Brinkerhoff Hill, the green lens was at the top. As far as I know, this is the only one in the world.
 In 1927, my grandfather bought the very first motorized milk truck in the state of New York. Hugh’s product line included milk, cream, butter, orange juice and eggs. He was a one-man breakfast cart. In those days, every large city boasted perhaps half a dozen home-grown department stores each one with its own cafeteria, as did iconic chains like Woolworth’s and Kresge’s Five & Dime (which would eventually transmogrify into K-Mart). Hugh counted among his commercial customers, every cafeteria, hotel, restaurant and diner of note in the Syracuse area.
