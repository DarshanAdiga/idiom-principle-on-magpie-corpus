In addition to the new Netflix series, Peg’s story played a role in the music video for the 2017 Lana Del Rey song Lust For Life, which featured Lana climbing the Hollywood sign before falling from it.
 In the song, Lana sings, “Climb up the H of the Hollywood sign, yeah. In these stolen moments the world is mine”.
 When I ask James whether he thinks Peg’s ghost haunting the Hollywood sign is just fanciful marketing by Hollywood tour guides or if he believes there is any truth in it, he laughs before answering: “Both! There’s been enough of them [sightings] reported by otherwise respected people, so something seems strange up there.
 “I sometimes get asked to go to the sign with ghost hunters and psychics on the anniversaries of Peg’s death. I won’t ever do that, as I don’t want to turn her life into a sideshow.
 “Of course, the tour guides have to keep them coming back, so I know they used to jazz up the ghost story angle. But not so much any more. Since the book came out there seems to be a more respectful, thoughtful version of Peg being presented to the tourists. That was my hope all along. Less fantasy, more Peg.”

Peg’s biographer believes that the ultimate reason for Peg taking her own life was rejection by Broadway, the place she cherished above all else, that conspired to throw her into a state of mental anguish.
 “More than anything, it was not being able to return to Broadway,” he says. “Peg could have remained in Hollywood to be a bit player or an extra until something broke either at the studios or the circle of Broadway producers forgave her for disrespecting them, as a whole. But that wasn’t her style. Peg was not designed to be ‘girl at table’ in a film or stage drama and she would never think of getting a job in a diner slinging hash for $5 a day when she could play a waitress on screen or on Broadway for $5,000 per week.
 “But film wasn’t her goal. Never was. Remember, if Peg Entwistle had wanted to be a movie star she would have stayed in Hollywood. She lived up the street from most of the studios, had connections and talent and looks. But the stage was her calling and the biggest stage for a thespian was Broadway, and that was her first true love.
 “Everything else was a factor, but being blacklisted from Broadway was the reason when you peel back all the other curtains of her life.
 “She was just overwhelmed by all the pitfalls that came so close together. We will never know all that happened in her final days and hours – conversations, encounters and the like. But we know enough to be sure that this young girl’s dreams fell down around her like a house of cards.
 “Some of it was her own doing. Her ego helped fuel a number of bad decisions, which got her blacklisted at the same time that her film career crashed before it could really get off the ground.”

Heather J. Barnett, Branch Manager of Barnett Financial Partners, Inc. associated with Wells Fargo Advisors Financial Network, LLC, in Keokuk, has been recognized as one of "America's Top Women Advisors" by Forbes.
   
 This accolade represents a list of professionals who come to work with one goal on their mind -- helping their clients succeed.
   
 "It's an honor to be named among America's top women advisors, as determined by Forbes," said Barnett. "It seems a common misperception that to get 'expert' advice, one needs to go to a 'big city'. I hope this accolade is a testament to the fact that one doesn't have to go out of their way to receive the financial guidance and advice that you want and deserve."
   
 Barnett has been a financial advisor with Wells Fargo Advisors Financial Network and its predecessor firms for 24 years and she has 26 years of experience in the brokerage industry. She has been a certified financial planner since 2006. She holds a master of science in business administration with a concentration in finance from University of Wisconsin-Madison
   
 Barnett lives in Hamilton, Illinois, with her husband, Ryan, and their two sons, Tanner and Brayden.

St. Charles County has slowly begun to reopen several businesses that had been closed due to COVID-19      By Brett Auten      It was a return, but it was far from normal.      The St. Charles County area reopened several business doors last week that had been closed due to COVID-19. Beginning last week, the statewide restrictions on social gatherings were gone and every business was free to reopen, according to Missouri Gov. Mike Parson.      Main Street Salon has been a fixture in Old St. Charles for 15 years. Owner Billy Woodson and staff are usually booking clients every 90-minutes. Now, they are spaced out two-to-two-and-a-half hours so that extra cleaning and sanitizing can be performed. Stylists are also donning personal protective equipment.      “The girls are all taking their time with this and wiping everything down like crazy,” Woodson said. “Everybody was ready to get back to work and all the clients felt great about us opening up.”      Main Street Salon's phone was ringing off the hook all week. But appointments were scheduled for existing clients only.      “A lot of clients, especially those who are older, waited patiently and they were pretty much at the top of the list to get in first,” Main Street Salon's Molly Sczepanski said. “It has been working out quite well,”      Woodson is feeling a bit trepidatious about how long this will last.      “I am kind of scared that there will be another hiatus,” he said. “I hope I'm wrong, but I think we will have another closure somewhere down the line.”      You would be challenged to find a more anxious group to get back after than those in the fitness industry and its customers who are craving a shot of exercise dopamine.      O'Fallon's Powerbody USA Fitness Center was one of the few – if only – gyms to open its doors last week. Powerbody USA is a literal 'Mom and Pop' organization, so it had a little more flexibility to open than the more commercial, box gyms.      “We are thrilled to be back open and so are our members,” Chuck Trosper, who along with his wife Carla, owns Powerbody USA. “They were going crazy.”      Powerbody USA caters both to serious powerlifting competitors and regular folks just looking to get a pump on. Trosper said he didn't lose any members during the time away but did have some personal trainers jump ship.      “(The quarantine) definitely put a hurt on us,” Trosper said. “For the people who are into fitness and couldn't get access to equipment for home gyms because people were jacking up the prices on Craigslist, they were ready for us to return.”      Craig Uttendorf is one of the co-owners of St. Charles' Gingham's Homestyle Restaurant, a staple for both early birds and night owls. Gingham's started taking dine-in service on May 6.      “It has been a little mixed,” Uttendorf said of attendance. “On the first day, there were a lot of regulars who wanted to see the staff. We had a lot of older folks come in. Some were in wheelchairs, another was on oxygen. For them to get out to see us during all that is going on is pretty special.”      Uttendorf had to make several adjustments to ready for dine-in customers again. Among them, he pulled out furniture and tables to allow for proper social distancing, constructed Plexiglas walls, restructured the entrances and exits, and eliminated the guest seating area. Patrons can wait either in their car or outside, and a text will inform them when their table is ready. Not only are all employees wearing masks and gloves, but the waitresses are not allowed to touch the food. A professional sanitation crew is also scheduled to come in three times a week. Uttendorf leaned on information from the Center for Disease Control and other officials within his industry.      “There is so much information and guidance out there for restaurants when they decide to come back,” Uttendorf said. “I feel like we have done everything we needed and maybe more.”      Gingham's has always been a 24-hour-a-day establishment but Uttendorf has curbed the closing time.      “We have always done a ton of business on the later shifts,” Uttendorf said. “But right now with no Lindenwood, no casinos, no concerts and no baseball; we are just going to play it by ear for the next couple of weeks.”

On April 2, 1921, Peg’s stepmother Lauretta died, aged 35, after contracting meningitis. Teenage Peg had grown extremely close to Lauretta during their eight years together – to all intents and purposes the woman was her mother.
 There was more tragedy to befall the young girl. The following year, when she was 14, her father was knocked down by a limousine in a hit-and-run in November 1922. Although he survived, he died of a brain haemorrhage a month later, the week before Christmas. He was 48.
 “In his will, Robert stated that he did not want Peg’s mother to regain parental rights,” says James. “The will indicates that her birth mother Emily was still alive but not where she was living when Robert died.
 “Peg was devastated by the loss of her stepmother, Lauretta. They had become inseparable. Peg had been studying hard to be an actor and in her mind her dream died with Lauretta because now she would have to be a mum to her baby brothers, Milton and Bobby.
 “When her father died so soon after, Peg was distraught for the obvious reasons, but even more so again as she adored New York and was not sure what would happen to her and her brothers. She didn’t want to return to the UK.
 “When Robert drafted his will on his dying bed in New York, he specifically gave instructions to the attorneys present that Peg is not to be given over to Emily, but to the custody of his brother Charles and his wife, Jane.”
 After the deaths of her father and stepmother, Peg and her two half-brothers went to live with their Uncles Charles and Aunty Jane in Los Angeles.

 “In the beginning, we look like we’re sad, we’re kind of down on our luck, and that’s kinda how everybody felt when this whole thing started. Then there was obviously the toilet paper crisis, so we were kinda playing on that,” the sergeant said. “And then toward the end we do kicks and punches, like ‘We’re gonna beat this.’”
 Other moves play homage to Gaynor’s original music video — minus the roller skates.
 He hopes the fun won’t end with that video.
 “I personally hope (the sheriff’s department does) respond, I think it’d be kind of funny,” the sergeant said. “I hope other agencies jump on board as well.”

Arsenal are being linked with a move to sign Unai Nunez this summer, but who is he?
 The 23 year-old is currently plying his trade as a defender for Athletic Bilbao in La Liga, and has already broken into the Spanish squad, earning one cap thus far.
 Nunez joined his current club at the age of 10, and worked his way up through the ranks before joining up with the first-team in 2017, making his debut in August, helping his side to a clean sheet.
 He played out most of his breakthrough season as a first-team regular, but has since been used sparingly in the two most recent seasons, and has now supposedly turned down two contract offers by the club.
 The defender is believed to be available for £25 Million due to a clause in his contract, and is believed to be looking to consider his options in the coming window.
 Check out some of his best bits below and let us know if you think he could be a good addition to our squad.

It's not clear when the project to build the new theater will begin. Initially, a local construction company was going to build and fund it in exchange for the government giving the firm a nearby land plot to build towers on it. But the government abandoned that plan because of protests, and the construction of the new theater will now be funded by Tirana's city hall.

 Don't expect too much from the song itself - it's sung more with enthusiasm than operatic levels of technical vocal ability - and Claudia shares the tongue-in-cheek reviews on the Grape-o-Gram Facebook page, where she also takes bookings.

 A view of the east of Hanoi by the Red River. (Photo cafef.vn) According to experts, Hanoi's eastern area has grown strongly over the past 10 years. Transport projects, including the extended Highway No 5, the intersection of the Ring Road 3 with the Hanoi- Hai Phong and Co Linh motorway, and phase 2 of Vinh Tuy Bridge, will be built from 2020-24. Phase 2 of Vinh Tuy Bridge will cost a total of 2.5 trillion VND (106.5 million USD). There are also plans for Tran Hung Dao Bridge, Giang Bien Bridge and Tu Lien Bridge in the area. At the same time, as one of the largest realty developers in Vietnam, Vingroup has recently asked for investment policies to build two overpasses at the crossroads between Dong Du and Duong Xa streets and a highway adjacent to Vinhomes Ocean Park. When the two overpasses are finished, they will form a modern traffic axis, creating flexible traffic flow from all directions connecting the entire city with the east of Hanoi. Along with transport infrastructure, social infrastructure is also an advantage in the area. Facilities such as Aeon Mall, BigC Long Bien, Savico Megamall, Tokyo Medical Hospital and the upcoming Vincom… Read full this story

But after Friday's ceremony, during which he drove through in his family's red four-door pickup truck decorated with a huge banner noting his athletic and scholastic achievements, Avery's tune had changed. He was now acting like, well, someone who had just graduated high school.
 "I feel great, it was bigger than I thought it would be, more people came out," he said. "It was just amazing."
 For Webster County and its roughly 13,000 people, graduation is a big deal. There's only one high school, fed by the quintessential small, rural towns that dot the county nestled in the rolling hills of Western Kentucky. Once the drive-through ceremony ended, graduates returned to those towns to parade. They were greeted by friends, neighbors and family who, despite the rainy evening, lined the main thoroughfares to cheer them on.
 Principal Jarrod Hankins said that because Webster County High School is a "multigenerational school," the community had to be involved in the altered graduation ceremony plans.
 "Most of the grandparents went to school here, the parents went to school here, so the kids are going to school here," he told NPR.
 Furthermore, it's typical for nearly 50% of a graduating class not to go to college, Hankins said, instead going straight into a trade or, until recently, the coal mines.
 "This is the highest level of education that some students are going to have," he said. "So that's a special moment for that family."
 A.J. Avery, who is headed to college in the fall, said, in the end, his graduation was actually very special. (And he did get to make the commencement address, it was just prerecorded.)
