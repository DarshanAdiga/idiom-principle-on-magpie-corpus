Citizens, business operators and churches in unincorporated Christian County have a new set of COVID-19 guidelines to follow until May 31.
 The guidelines were adopted by a 2-1 vote of the Christian County Commission conducted after about 30 minutes of debate on May 1. Eastern District Commissioner Mike Robertson and Presiding Commissioner Ralph Phillips cast the two votes in favor of the COVID-19 prevention orders, while Western District Commissioner Hosea Bilyeu put out the dissenting vote.
 Christian County set a limit on gatherings to 20 or fewer people. Daily operations of a business are not considered public gatherings as part of the order.
 Despite his dissent, Bilyeu said he agreed with most of the provisions in the order that the commission adopted.
 “I will probably vote ‘No,’ but after I vote ‘No,’ I will give 100 percent of my support,” Bilyeu said.
 Rural church services were the sticking point for Bilyeu, who wanted to remove language that would limit churches to house no more than 50 percent of their maximum fire code occupancy at any given moment.
 “I’m thinking of the rural churches in Christian County. I’m thinking of Chestnutridge Baptist Church that seats about 75 people,” Bilyeu said. “Honestly, I think many of them would be delighted if they had 50 percent of their building space filled up.”
 Bilyeu also asked to consider dropping occupancy limitations on funeral homes. Such a policy would have only applied to one funeral home in Christian County that sits outside of Ozark and Nixa’s limits.
 The geographic impact of the order is important to Phillips, the presiding commissioner, who stressed that orders in place for Ozark and Nixa will supersede the county commission’s order.
 “Our order does not have any authority over the state’s order or the orders issued by our municipalities,” Phillips said. “If you are in the city limits of any municipality, their orders will be enforced, not the county’s.”
 There are some minor differences between Christian County’s order and the orders of Ozark and Nixa, just as there are differences between Christian County’s order and an order in Springfield that limits gatherings to no more than 15 persons.
 “I think it’s critical to minimize the confusion,” Phillips said. “I’ve not had anybody call me in dispute of what we’re doing with this order right here. I’ve probably spent 12-15 hours a day for the last five days working on this.”
 The spirit of the law, Phillips said, is the same. He emphasized the need for continued physical distancing practices in public places. At the Friday morning hearing, he also stressed that businesses work to keep their establishments clean and limit the size of gatherings in accordance with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines.
 “I can’t emphasize enough the importance of social distancing and the groups of smaller numbers. We can hope that this will not cause us to have a spike in (COVID-19 cases), but there are still a lot of unknowns,” Philips said.
 Businesses providing personal care of any kind are limited to 25 percent or less of their fire code capacity under the Christian County order.
 Any businesses engaged in retail sales to the public are limited to 25 percent of the building’s maximum fire code occupancy. If the businesses is 10,000 square feet in size or larger, it is limited to no more than 10 percent of its maximum fire code occupancy.
 Restaurants and all other non-retail businesses are limited to 50 percent fire code capacity.
 Bilyeu, who works as a pastor in addition to holding office on the county commission, feels like the order treats rural churches scattered through the countryside in the same way it treats larger churches in the middle of Ozark or Nixa. Smaller churches should be treated differently, he said.
 “My personal opinion is that I would prefer that we follow the language of the governor’s recommendation,” Bilyeu said. “I think Chestnutridge Baptist Church ought to be different than First Baptist Church in Nixa, and I’m only using those as illustrations, because they’re in different settings and different people and so forth.”
 There are still some uncertainties for churches that want to attempt to hold non-traditional services while under the occupancy limits, Bilyeu said.
 “We have one church that I know of that would like to be an outdoor service, but not a drive-in service. In other words, they would come and they would sit at certain distances from each other,” Bilyeu said. “I don’t know what they would do if it rains.”
 Phillips said that he understood Bilyeu’s stance, but asked that he consider the top priority behind the COVID-19 spread prevention order, which is to protect public health and minimize confusion.
 “I think our obligation is to the health of the community as a whole,” Phillips said. “My thinking on this is to be consistent with the municipalities that are mostly impacted.”
 About 12 hours before the commission issued its new order, the Christian County Health Department announced the 21st documented case of COVID-19 for Christian County.
 According to a statement from the health department, the infected person went into self-quarantine after realizing their possibility for exposure to the virus. “Several days later,” the person began to experience symptoms of COVID-19, and sought help and testing from medical professionals.
 As of April 7, the person would have been considered “recovered” by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines. However, the results of the test for the COVID-19 patient were not reported to the Christian County Health Department until April 30, “long after a chance to have done the contact tracing.” The health department statement said that there have not been any associated cases of COVID-19 linked to this case that have been documented.
 The health department reports that it contacts anyone who has been in contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19. Health department officials interview the infected person and makes contact with “anyone who needs to be aware.”
 The health department and the Christian County Emergency Management Agency have moved away from identifying the cities in which the patients reside, unless they deem it necessary to inform the general public of possible exposures.
 At least 14 of Christian County’s 21 coronavirus patients are classified as “recovered” under CDC guidelines.

The badminton world championship slated for August next year in Spain will now take place from November 29 to December 5, the sport's apex body said on Friday, postponing its showpiece to avoid a clash with the Olympics. "The Badminton World Federation (BWF) and Spanish Badminton Federation (FESBA) can confirm the BWF World Championships traditionally scheduled for August 2021 will now take place at the end of 2021 from Monday 29 November to Sunday 5 December," the BWF said in a statement. The world championship has traditionally been an annual event, which is however not held in an Olympic year.
 But, with the 2020 Tokyo Games postponed to next year owing to the COVID-19 pandemic, it will be the first time that the prestigious event will be conducted in the Olympic year. The decision to postpone the Tokyo 2020 Olympic and Paralympic Games to 23 July to 8 August and 24 August until 5 September 2021 only confirmed this move, the BWF said.
 BWF president Poul-Erik Hoyer said changing the BWF World Championships to late November was in the best interests of the sport.
 "BWF and Spanish Badminton Federation are confident that the rescheduled championships will be a success. The move allows both the Olympic badminton competition and the World Championships to be conducted with equal fairness for everyone," Hoyer said.
 The decision means reigning champion PV Sindhu will get a chance to defend her title when the tournament is held at the Carolina Marin Stadium, the arena named after the three-time world champion in her native city of Huelva in Spain.
 FESBA president David Cabello said: "We hope the World Championships in Huelva will be a special occasion for badminton in Spain and the world.
 "We are satisfied that moving the championships to the end of the year will allow us to deliver the best tournament possible." The BWF had suspended all tournaments till end of July in light of the escalating cases of the novel coronavirus, which has infected over 30 lakh people worldwide.
 The governing body had also frozen the world rankings, saying standings as on March 17 will be the basis for entry and seedings when it restarts the international calendar.
 The BWF added, "the remainder of the 2021 BWF Tournament Calendar is yet to be finalised" and "a further announcement will be made on the qualifying process for next year's Olympic Games, Paralympic Games and World Championships."
 Sindhu had claimed the crown last year at Switzerland, while B Sai Praneeth had won a bronze in the tournament, becoming the first Indian male shuttler in 36 years to achieve the feat.

“My items are not expensive - but if someone orders a lot, it definitely adds up quickly. I think the key is to start small. I see a lot of shop owners get over-excited and spend too much on overhead to start with. Creating items is hit and miss. A full-time shop is a commitment for sure. Some weeks I probably work a lot more than 40 hours, but I really love what I do and so it doesn’t feel like work to me. I have the freedom of working from my own office, but I also face the stress of fluctuating market.”
 “My items are cheap. I sell cards for $5 a piece. This month I have 74 orders. It doesn’t take long for me to fulfill one order. So even if it’s not a full- time job, I still pay myself $20 an hour. With more expensive items, you just spend more on supplies and production time.”

The country’s second largest carmaker, Hyundai Motor India on Friday said it also sold zero units in April during the lockdown following suspension of manufacturing activities. Domestic sales stood nil last month amid nationwide lockdown due to COVID-19 pandemic, Hyundai Motor India said in a statement.
 However, the company managed to export 1,341 units last month.
 Automobile manufacturer Mahindra & Mahindra on Friday reported a massive decline of 98% in its total vehicle sales in April 2020 to 733 units due to the national lockdown imposed to curb the COVID-19 outbreak.
 The company had sold a total of 43,721 units in April 2019.
 Industry analysts have cited the COVID-19 crisis as the main reason for such downfall in sales numbers.
 Furthermore, the company reported nil domestic sales last month. It had sold 41,603 units in April 2019.
 Only exports' segment showed some life. M&M exported 733 units in the month under review, which is a decline of 65% on a YoY basis from 2,118 vehicles which were shipped out in April 2019.
 Commenting on the situation, Veejay Nakra, Chief Executive Officer, Automotive Division, Mahindra & Mahindra said: "At Mahindra, we are working hand in hand with all stakeholders, especially our dealer and supplier partners, to get our ecosystem started, once the lockdown is lifted. The safety of all our employees will be of paramount importance to us while resuming our operations. We are hopeful that our dealerships will open soon and have stocks to cover the first few weeks of sale.”
 Toyota India also reported zero sales for the month of April amid the lockdown.
 "We were aware that there would be no wholesales in April due to lockdown enforced to contain COVID-19 spread in the country," said the Indo-Japanese joint venture vice-president for sales and services, Naveen Soni in a statement.
 The city-based auto major sold 7,023 cars and exported 999 units of Etios model in March before the first phase of the 21-day lockdown was enforced on March 25.
 In contrast, the company sold 12,818 units in the domestic market and exported 844 Etios cars the same month a year ago (2019).
 "COVID-19 crisis exacerbated the pressures on the automobile industry. Though the lockdown was necessary for the safety of the people, adverse impact of it on the economic activity has been its side-effect," asserted Soni.
 MG Motor India on Friday also reported nil retail sales for April as its showrooms were closed due to nationwide lockdown.
 Calling it the new normal, the company said that it began operations and manufacturing on a small scale at its facility in Halol, Gujarat in the last week of April 2020.
 It hopes that the production will ramp up in the month of May and is working on the local supply-chain support.
 "MG Motor India is gearing up for working as per new norms including sanitisation and social distancing," the company said in a statement.
 "In the current scenario, its prime focus remains on health, well-being and training of its entire workforce including dealer employees, on new SOP. The company continues to serve the communities around where it operates, in every possible way it can,” the company said in a statement.
 The lockdown which has been deemed necessary to curb the spread of COVID-19, has dealt a heavy blow to commerce, leading to a temporary closure of shopping malls, grounding of aircraft, shutting down of factories and deserted market places.

Brianne Dlugosch is preparing for what she considers a second grand opening on Friday.
 Only a few weeks after her restaurant, 5D Steakhouse, opened on North Navarro Street in February, she was forced to close her dining room to customers because of restrictions put in place to stop the spread of COVID-19.
 “I want to get my staff back working,” Dlugosch said Thursday, as her employees disinfected the restaurant, set up sanitizer stations and marked off tables to adhere with Gov. Greg Abbott’s rule that businesses only allow a maximum of 25% occupancy. “If I can get some of them back to work, that’s my main goal.”
 Dlugosch’s dining room is one of many that will open across the state Friday after the expiration of Abbott’s statewide stay-at-home order at midnight Thursday.
 Abbott announced Monday that all restaurants, retail outlets, movie theaters and malls can reopen Friday at 25% capacity. If the next two weeks of data show the virus is contained, Abbott said phase 2 of reopening could begin as early as May 18. In phase 2, more types of businesses would be allowed to reopen and maximum capacity would be bumped to 50%.
 The openings occur the day after the U.S. Department of Labor announced another 3.8 million people filed for unemployment in the week ending on April 25. A total 30.3 million people, about 18.6% of the U.S. labor force, have filed for unemployment in the past six weeks.
 With a maximum 25% occupancy, Dlugosch can only afford to bring back about 60 of the restaurant’s original 106 employees. She hopes as occupancy percentages increase, she’ll be able to rehire more of her staff.
 “Restaurants work on a very low margin as it is,” Dlugosch said. “That’s just the nature of the restaurant business.”
 Under the 25% occupancy restriction, opening isn’t financially feasible for many business owners.
 Dennis Patillo, who owns The PumpHouse Riverside Restaurant and Bar in Riverside Park, said he would only consider opening his restaurant at 50% occupancy.
 “It’s very, very difficult to do that and have it make any sort of economic sense,” he said.
 He’s also worried about the health and safety of his staff. For this reason, and unlike many local restaurants, The PumpHouse hasn’t offered pickup or delivery dining options.
 “In a commercial kitchen, it’s almost impossible to be able to adhere to a 6-foot social distance,” he said. “Cooking lines are close together. It’s a hive of activity.”
 Tammy Steinmann, owner of The Grand Theater in Yoakum, said she’ll delay opening the theater until at least phase 2 of the reopening plan because she doesn’t think the minimal income is worth the possibility of her staff getting sick.
 Cinemark issued a statement announcing it also won’t be reopening its Texas theaters, in large part because the next new movie, Christopher Nolan’s “Tenet,” won’t be released until July.
 Dr. John McNeill, Victoria County’s health authority, said his Mexican food restaurant, Frances Marie’s Restaurant and Cantina, will open Friday while adhering to the governor’s restrictions. For the restaurant, which has a 220-person capacity, that will mean only 55 people are allowed in the restaurant at a given time.
 In a news conference Wednesday, Victoria City Fire Marshal Tom Legler said his office will lead efforts to educate and enforce business owners about how to safely and legally reopen.
 Those efforts first will concentrate on educating rather than enforcing the state order, although failing to comply could result in fines of up to $1,000 and up to 180 days in jail.
 “We will probably at least visit and drive by locations to see what type of response the community has because we really don’t know if people are going to be lining up at the doors or ... take the time and wait a couple of weeks,” Legler said in the Wednesday news meeting. “We monitor it and see where we are because it’s such an unknown.”
 The fire marshal also encouraged residents to report businesses that fail to adhere to the 25% occupancy requirement and other stipulations included in the state order.
 Legler and McNeill said they have no idea as to what traffic will be like over the weekend.
 “It’s hard to judge,” McNeill said. “I’m not sure how many people are going to enjoy going to a restaurant at the beginning of this.”
 Before reopening, McNeill said his staff prepared by removing many tables at the restaurant, which opened almost four years ago.
 “May 23 is going to be our fourth anniversary,” he said. “This is certainly not how we planned to spend it.”

"I think I write the way I do because of a vitamin deficiency. I don't eat any vegetables. I just eat meat and potatoes. I think I'm trying to make up in my songwriting what I lack in vitamins." - John Prine      If he didn't already know what a spring tonic is, John Prine was the kind of person who would have been disappointed to learn it isn't an alcoholic drink. But I bet he knew. With roots in western Kentucky, he was country to the bone.      A spring tonic is a mix of wild plant parts traditionally gathered at the end of winter in many rural parts of America. Back in the day, folk survived winter on a Prine-style diet of rations that had dwindled to the likes of flour, bacon, potatoes and sugar. After months indoors on a white, greasy diet, the first hunt of the year for green, vitamin-rich plants was an awakening for the mind, body and belly.      I don't know that Prine went foraging for wild plants in his spare time, but even if he didn't long for chlorophyll, he acknowledged vegetables as a path to salvation. His advice to "plant a little garden, eat a lot of peaches, and try to find Jesus on your own" remains a three-line anthem to generations of back-to-the-landers.      Here in our first post-Prine spring we are largely stuck at home, or close to it, and there may not be a better time to forage the neighborhood for your own local spring tonic. I'm going to tell you how to serve it in the form of a gathered plant pesto. If you told him it was Weed Pesto, as I call it, the man with the twinkle in his songs might have used it.      Wild & edible   Every region will have its own list of edible, nutritious, ideally palatable spring greens. And there are some plants that are available nearly everywhere, like dandelion, lambsquarters, chickweed, purslane, dock, sorrel, cattails, nettles, watercress, asparagus and fiddlehead ferns. Even Johnny jump ups, also called violas, are edible, with a fresh, minty taste.      Each of these plants will have its own specifics for harvesting and cooking. Nettles, which have a fragrant, almost fishy taste, require scissors and a bag, and perhaps gloves, and should always be eaten cooked or blended unless you have the tongue of a bear. Dandelions, which are bitter as a good IPA beer, can be eaten raw or cooked; every single inch, from root to flower. Ditto for chickweed, which tastes a bit like parsley and licorice.      Many of the same principles for collecting wild plants also apply in your backyard. Every would-be forager must assess the grounds at their disposal and strategize accordingly.      The mentality involved in foraging is one to which any food shopper can relate. We go to the supermarket in search of one grocery item, but it's sold out and we have to improvise, and come home with another.      But the wild food we gather has not been vetted for edibility like grocery store food. Before you put anything in your mouth, find a trusted reference on the edible plants of your area. Search any piece of land that is legally available and clean of pesticides and other chemical and yellow animal fluids. Always do your harvesting away from any trail, and don't ever wipe out a location, so the patch can recover. And if you are lucky enough to have a backyard, explore every square inch.      How to enjoy   The easiest way to enjoy these plants might be in a saute pan, a handful of spring greens at a time, with salt, onions and olive oil. If you have a decent blender, this pesto recipe is thick with flavor, fat and chlorophyll. Toss it onto hot noodles. Scramble it into eggs or migas. Or just eat it off the spoon.      Pesto is one of the tastier ways to consume any green plant, especially those with strong flavors. It can incorporate essentially anything green, though some leaves, and combinations of leaves, will taste better than others. If not good enough, add more nuts, garlic, oil and cheese.      Our pesto will have a base of dandelion, since they are literally everywhere. In today's version I add nettles, as they are prolific right now where I live, and make a thick, aromatic pesto. But you could substitute any number of wild greens or weeds, like lambsquarter, watercress or chickweed, or a mixture of whatever you think will go well together. If these flavors are too strong, you could also substitute parsley or basil in place of some of the wild stuff.      Weed Pesto   8 servings   • 2 tablespoons chopped garlic   • 1 teaspoon salt   • 1 cup olive oil   • 1/2 cup almonds or pine nuts   • ½ cup grated parmesan or romano cheese   • Zest of a lemon, and 2 tablespoons of juice   • 4 cups chopped dandelion greens, loosely packed, spotlessly clean   • 5 three-inch nettle tips (or other greens)      Add the garlic, salt, oil, nuts, cheese, lemon juice and zest to the blender and turn them into a thin, homogenous solution. Carefully add the greens to the pesto, a few at a time, until they too are part of the smooth paste.   Serve tossed on piping hot noodles, which will cook the garlic just a tad. I like to stir in some sauteed greens, too.      Refrigerate the leftovers.

The uncommon application gives Mid Suffolk District Councillors a choice between the two projects, with both sets of plans set for land to the south on Union Road in Onehouse, near Stowmarket.
 The first scheme would see 146 homes built on the 19 acre plot alongside public open space, play space and associated highways and landscaping.
 Meanwhile, the other set of plans, would see 17 fewer homes built, but in their place would be a residential care home with up to 66 beds.
 Both schemes have very similar designs with 90% of the homes located in the same place.
 However in the north east corner of the plot a care home would be built in place of a number of homes if the second scheme is the preferred option.
 The plans will go in front of Mid Suffolk District Council’s planning committee in the coming months and a decision will be made on which option is best.
 The committee with be able to either permit one of the schemes, give both the schemes the green light and let development company Endurance Estates decide which to build, or reject them both.
 In a planning statement written on behalf of the developers it is said that the homes would help the district meet its housing needs.
 Within the statement it says it is thought that Mid-Suffolk’s population will rise by 9,300 people by 2036 and that 10,008 new dwellings are required in the same time period in order to meet local housing needs.
 A thorough public consultation took place before the plans were submitted .

When most people think of France a few settings likely spring to mind: Paris cafes, the Left Bank, vineyards in Provence, Riviera beaches -- France as the embodiment of culture with a capital C. Fans of extreme cinema, on the other hand, know that the country's artists have produced some of the twenty-first century's most ferocious horror films, many set in rural backwaters that don't make it into the tourist brochures. In that spirit, award-winning author Serge Joncour drops a cultured Parisian couple into a remote rental property in the sparsely populated Lot region and proceeds to unleash all manner of wild chaos upon them. The contemporary storyline of "Wild Dog" is paralleled, in alternating chapters, with an even more violent saga set on the same property in the first years of World War One. A smart, scathing and bleakly funny cross of folk horror, satire, and historical fiction.

Arkansas Colleges of Health Education (ACHE) announced this week that graduates of the Master of Science in Biomedicine (MSB) program will have their degrees conferred through a virtual video commencement.
   
 These 40 students represent the first students to graduate from the Arkansas Colleges of Health Education. The first class from the Arkansas College of Osteopathic Medicine (ARCOM) will graduate on May 15, 2021.
   
 "We are going to celebrate these students," Kyle D. Parker, CEO of ACHE, said of the biomedicine master's degree graduates. "In light of COVID-19, we will proceed with the celebration in a ceremony that falls under the safety guidelines as required by this national pandemic."
   
 Parker went on to say although he was disappointed the medical college we will not be able to recognize their achievements in a traditional face-to-face ceremony, the safety and well-being of students, faculty, and staff are at the forefront of every decision.
   
 "It is an honor to have Mayor George McGill as the keynote speaker," ACHE President Brian Kim added. "Mayor McGill has a long history of public service and volunteer work and the way he has led our community with both resilience and passion makes him the perfect person to address our first graduates. We are honored that he was willing to present his address to the students through our virtual ceremony."
   
 The commencement ceremony, originally planned for May 16, at Stubblefield Arena on the University of Arkansas - Fort Smith campus, will now be available on YouTube at 10 a.m. May 16. Students will receive the link via email and the link will also be made available for family and friends on the Arkansas Colleges of Health Education Facebook page.
   
 The keynote address given by Fort Smith Mayor McGill, along with speeches from Parker, Kim, Board of Trustees Chair John Taylor, and MSB Program Director Kenneth Hensley, Ph.D., were recorded in advance. Each graduate will be recognized with a slide displaying their photo and future plans and the official reading of their name. The ceremony will conclude with a photo montage to highlight their year-long work as MSB students.
   
 Following the May 16 ceremony, ACHE students will receive a graduation box that will contain the commemorative program, diploma cover, and a gift from the ACHE Alumni Association.
   
 ACHE is a private, nonprofit institution located on 430 acres in Fort Smith. ACHE's first college, the Arkansas College of Osteopathic Medicine (ARCOM) welcomed its inaugural class of 150 osteopathic medical students in August 2017. Construction is now complete on the new 66,000-square-foot facility that will be the home to Physical Therapy, Occupational Therapy, and Physician Assistant degree programs. ACHE is the first and only private institution in Arkansas that is dedicated solely to healthcare and wellness.

The first is that seeing them tell their story helped drive it home for me, the whole concept of change and growth. It’s not just the music, although it is very much the music, too. (It’s wild to think that the same group that made, like, “Girls” also made “I Don’t Know.”). It's more that the snotty kids who snarled and sprayed beer on the audience grew into thoughtful dudes with regrets about their childish behavior. I can relate to that. I think a lot of us can. There’s this tendency we have, collectively, as a society, to hold up something someone said five, ten, or twenty years ago and refuse to let them off the hook for it today, as though people can’t course correct in the time between then and now. If we’re always holding people to their words and behavior from the past, then what’s the point of trying to improve, to become better? There’s a good line in the movie that’s taken from an old interview with Adam Horovitz: “I’d rather be a hypocrite than the same person forever.” Yup, that about sums it up.

United officials didn’t say what their current load factor – percentage of filled seats – is, but other carriers have reported load factors currently in the 5% to 7% range. Airlines had been running load factors above 80% in the last few years. And had been need to fill more than 70% just to break even on their daily flight operations. Thus, United and its competitors now have a long, long way to go in terms of generating enough demand to once again simply cover their operating costs, let alone earn profits.

The uncommon application gives Mid Suffolk District Councillors a choice between the two projects, with both sets of plans set for land to the south on Union Road in Onehouse, near Stowmarket. The first scheme would see 146 homes built on the 19 acre plot alongside public open space, play space and associated highways and landscaping. Meanwhile, the other set of plans, would see 17 fewer homes built, but in their place would be a residential care home with up to 66 beds. Both schemes have very similar designs with 90% of the homes located in the same place. However in the north east corner of the plot a care home would be built in place of a number of homes if the second scheme is the preferred option. The plans will go in front of Mid Suffolk District Council's planning committee in the coming months and a decision will be made on which option is best. The committee with be able to either permit one of the schemes, give both the schemes the green light and let development company Endurance Estates decide which to build, or reject them both. In a planning statement written on behalf of the developers it is said that the homes would help the district meet its housing needs. Within the statement it says it is thought that Mid-Suffolk's population will rise by 9,300 people by 2036 and that 10,008 new dwellings are required in the same time period in order to meet local housing needs. A thorough public consultation took place before the plans were submitted . Over the course of a four-hour exhibition in near-by Stowmarket, 90 people were shown the designs by representatives from Endurance Estates. The developer received 90 responses from residents who raised a number of issues, mostly in relation to the village's highways networks and insufficient local services including medical care and schooling. Endurance Estates said they 'carefully considered' all of the responses and attempted to address the majority of them before submitting the application.

 The Saints are still the obvious gatekeeper of the NFC South after a great season last year. When Drew Brees went down early it looked like the Saints’ chances for the season would be called into question. Instead, Teddy Bridgewater held it down until Brees returned to cap off another great season in a historic career that's been full of playoff failures.

To housing market watchers, the rise is reminiscent of the Great Recession — but it doesn't yet spell a similar foreclosure boom.
 Washington state, and Seattle in particular, actually have some of the lowest rates of mortgage delinquency in the country, the data show. Just 1.62% of Washington households are delinquent on their home loans or in foreclosure, compared to 3.39% nationally. And overall, mortgage delinquencies remain near record lows. But the number grew more rapidly here than in the nation as a whole.
 Delinquencies don't tell the full tale of who's behind on their mortgage payments.
 The number of mortgage-holders who have negotiated forbearance agreements with their lenders to postpone mortgage payments also is on the rise, according to Black Knight. As of April 30, 3.85 million homeowners were in forbearance, representing a combined $841 billion in unpaid principal and 7.3% of all active mortgages — a threefold increase from a month ago.
 "It feels like we've compressed the 2008 financial crisis into the last seven weeks," said Tom Schwab, the owner of Westwood Mortgage in Northgate.
 More number-crunching is needed to determine whether cities and states that responded quickly to the pandemic by closing businesses and asking residents to stay home saw a greater rise in delinquencies, said Black Knight director of market research Andy Walden.
 California was the first state to institute a lockdown, on March 19. Delinquencies there rose 10.7%, month-over-month. In New York, which enacted a stay-at-home order March 22, delinquencies rose 9.8%.
 But Michigan and Ohio, which told residents to stay home around the same time, saw much smaller shifts. In Ohio, which instituted a stay-at-home order March 23, delinquencies actually fell by 1.7%.
 Amid economic turmoil and tighter lending standards, fewer people are applying for mortgages. In Washington, mortgage applications were down 36.9% for the week ending April 24, compared to the same week last year.
 That's a major improvement over the week prior, though, when mortgage applications were down 45.8% from 2019.
 Other indicators, too, are that home sales activity is on the rebound from a major slide in March.
 Home shoppers, though, are finding difficulty securing financing.
 Mortgage availability has contracted significantly in recent weeks as underwriting criteria tighten and pricing — particularly at the low- and high- end extremes of the market — rises.
 Wells Fargo and US Bank both adjusted their minimum credit score requirements to 680, including for FHA and VA loans, which typically finance borrowers with credit scores as low as 580, including plenty of first-time homebuyers with low down payments. Navy Federal Credit Union stopped offering FHA loans altogether.
 Purchasers of higher-end homes have also seen their options restricted. And home buyers everywhere may be expected to put more down than they would have before the crisis if they want to take advantage of historically low interest rates.
 "We're not seeing a decrease in traffic," Schwab said. "We're seeing a decrease in the number of solutions we can offer right now."

New Delhi, May 1 (PTI) The government's decision to allow e-commerce companies to sell all items, including non-essential items like laptops and refrigerators, in orange and green zones will provide relief to people, while helping millions of small and medium businesses and traders to jump-start their businesses amid the lockdown, industry executives said on Friday.
 The government has now extended the lockdown till May 17 with a ban on air travel, trains and inter-state road transport. It, however, gave some relaxations for various business activities and people's movement within areas with limited or no COVID-19 cases.
 Under the latest rules, e-commerce activities in red zones are permitted only for essential goods, while delivery of both essential and non-essential items will be allowed in green and orange zones during the third phase of lockdown. All major urban centres, including Delhi and Mumbai, have been identified as 'red zones' or areas with large numbers of cases and, therefore, not much relaxations would be applicable to them beyond already permitted ones for those involved in essential services.
 "We welcome the government's decision to allow e-commerce in orange and green zones to serve people safely with products that they need and have not been able to access due to the lockdown. Millions of small and medium businesses and traders will now be able to jump-start their businesses and livelihoods across their workforce," an Amazon India spokesperson said.
 The spokesperson said the company will focus on maintaining the "sanctity of the new guidelines around the red zones".
 The company urged the government to consider the positive role e-commerce can play to get customers all priority products they need in the red zones as well, enabling a stronger economic support for the small businesses while prioritising safety.
 Under the lockdown that started March 24, the government has only allowed delivery of essential goods, including food, pharmaceuticals and medical equipment through e-commerce platforms. E-commerce companies as well as industry bodies like Nasscom and IAMAI had been requesting the government to expand the list of essential items.
 The latest rules also allow all standalone shops, neighbourhood shops and shops in residential complexes to remain open in urban areas, without any distinction of essential and non-essential.
 "The government has taken an insightful decision by opening e-commerce deliveries of non-essential items in green and orange zones," Paytm Mall Senior Vice-President Srinivas Mothey said.
 He said customers have been eagerly waiting for some relief in lockdown guidelines to buy products like air conditioners, refrigerators and even summer clothing. People are also keen on purchasing items like laptops, mobile phones, computer hardware and stationery to continue work and study from home.
 "This move will give a major relief to citizens... Paytm Mall's offline merchant and shopkeeper base will now be able to get back to running their businesses and safely sell to their customers maintaining all lockdown and social distancing norms," Mothey said.
 A Snapdeal spokesperson said the announcement by the home ministry paves the way for a "calibrated" resumption of various economic activities, including e-commerce, in various parts of the country.
 "This will help start a gradual process of economic recovery by enabling lakhs of sellers and MSMEs to cater to the demand of users through online and offline channels. At Snapdeal, we are ready and committed to play our role in enabling India to exit this lockdown safely and efficiently," the spokesperson said.
 Earlier in the day, the Union health ministry listed 130 districts in the country in red zone, 284 in orange zone and 319 in green zone.
 This classification of districts is to be followed by states and union territories till May 10 and then will be revised on a weekly basis or earlier if required. Major cities like Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata, Hyderabad, Pune, Bengaluru and Ahmedabad have been designated as red zones in the new classification.
 A district will be considered under green zone if there has been no confirmed cases of COVID-19 so far or there is no reported case since last 21 days in the district. Red zone districts are those considered to be infection 'hotspots', decided on the basis of number of active cases, doubling rate of confirmed cases and extent of testing and surveillance feedback.
 Districts that are neither defined as a red or green zone, would be considered as an orange zone.

(AP) - The U.S. Education Department has continued to garnish wages from workers who are behind on their student loan payments even after Congress ordered the agency to suspend the practice during the coronavirus pandemic, a new lawsuit charges.In this March 27, 2020, file photo, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos speaks about the coronavirus in the James Brady Press Briefing Room in Washington. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos previously told federal student loan borrowers that garnishments would be halted through Sept. 30, with no action needed on their part. The complaint, filed Thursday in federal court in Washington, alleges that thousands of workers are getting up to 15% of their paychecks held back because the Education Department has failed to notify employers that they must stop withholding pay. It was filed by consumer and student advocacy groups on behalf of Elizabeth Barber, a home health aide in New York, and any others who have lost wages during the crisis.Barber, 59, said the department has docked her pay multiple times since Congress approved its March 27 rescue package calling for immediate suspension of involuntary collections. Barber makes less than $13 per hour, according to the complaint, and has had 12% of her pay withheld in recent weeks. Barber says she's being forced to leave electricity and water bills unpaid so she can cover basic needs."I have no money in the bank. I need every dollar I earn at work to survive each day, but my hours have been cut because of the virus," said Barber, of Penfield, New York. "I don't understand why the government keeps taking my money away after it passed a law that says they will stop."The department declined to comment on the lawsuit but said it has taken immediate action to halt garnishments. It says employers have been contacted by phone, email and letters instructing them to stop docking pay."Payments we receive via garnished wages will be immediately processed for refund, and the employer will be contacted again to ensure the guidance to stop garnishing wages is understood," spokeswoman Angela Morabito said in a statement.Education Secretary Betsy DeVos previously told federal student loan borrowers that garnishments would be halted through Sept. 30, with no action needed on their part. She was applauded by advocates for announcing the change even before Congress required it. On March 25, DeVos said collections were being paused and workers would be refunded $1.8 billion that had been taken since March 13."These are difficult times for many Americans, and we don't want to do anything that will make it harder for them to make ends meet or create additional stress," DeVos said in announcing the change.But the suit says DeVos has failed to deliver on her promise. "The department still has not ensured that all affected employers have received instructions to stop garnishing the pay of their employees with defaulted federal student loans," according to the complaint. It alleges that the department attempted to send emails to employers, but that most were never opened.Federal law authorizes the Education Department to garnish up to 15% of workers' paychecks without a court order if they go into default on federal student loan payments. The agency can issue garnishment orders to employers and contracts with private agencies to enforce collection. Last year, the department garnished $842 million from workers, according to federal data.On April 1, the department issued new guidance for borrowers whose pay was still getting docked. It said their employers' human resource departments would be getting letters instructing them to stop, and it promised refunds for the garnishments. But advocacy groups say wages are still being withheld, and borrowers are still waiting on refunds.A group of 42 Democrats in Congress raised concern over the issue in an April 16 letter to DeVos and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin. The letter, led by Rep. Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts and Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, said borrowers and advocates were reporting that employers and private collection agencies had failed to implement the suspension weeks after it had been ordered."This is simply unconscionable," the Democrats wrote. "This administration's actions and disregard for these new protections under federal law will place workers and families in further economic jeopardy."The lawsuits asks the court to order that DeVos halt wage garnishment immediately and notify borrowers when it has actually been stopped. It also demands immediate refunds for any pay that has been withheld since March 13, the day President Donald Trump declared a national emergency."With the president at her side, Secretary DeVos promised in March that she had stopped federal wage garnishments altogether," said Alex Elson, senior counsel at Student Defense, one of the advocacy groups that filed the suit. "The truth is, she keeps on taking wages from the paychecks of Americans struggling to make ends meet. We are suing to make her stop."The suit was also filed by the National Consumer Law Center.The complaint says more than $900 has been withheld from Barber since March 13, with garnishments continuing as recently as April 24. Barber went into default on her student loans in 2019 and owes about $10,000. She borrowed the money to attend Nazareth College in 2010, where she studied psychology.Copyright 2020 Associated Press.
