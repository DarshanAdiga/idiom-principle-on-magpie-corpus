I am active duty in the U.S. Marine Corps. This letter is to express my opinion about Alamance County commissioner candidate Pamela Tyler Thompson. My views do not serve as an endorsement from the Marine Corps and are solely my opinion.
   
 From July 2014 to July 2017 I was a recruiter in Burlington. My goal was to serve as a counselor to young men and women and to display the opportunities of the military. I was also a representative for the Marine Corps in the community to help influential people understand what serving in the Marines is about. In my opinion, Alamance County is military friendly. However, being new in the community can pose challenges for military recruiters in an unfamiliar area. Getting support in the mission is vital.
   
 One way to expose young men and women to career opportunities in the military is to visit area schools. One friendly face in all the schools was Pamela Tyler Thompson, who was serving on the Alamance-Burlington Board of Education. Pam expressed the most genuine support of the military, veterans and my mission. This was evident when I introduced her to the Marine Corps Educators Workshop, which is a one-week visit to Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island to immerse educators in the rigors of recruit training, which includes physical training, discipline from drill instructors and one-on-one time with recruits. Pam not only jumped at the opportunity, but she also reached out to additional educators to join her. She set up conferences with me and school board members to discuss ways to get information about military opportunities to students, parents and educators.
   
 Pam supported my family by helping my son feel more comfortable in a new school. She and her husband, Craig, became friends to my family and helped Burlington become home while I was stationed there. That's why I am excited to hear she is running for county commissioner. If elected, she will bring positive energy and give everything she has to Alamance County.

The bushfires in Australia are so severe they have already scorched an area almost the size of Ireland and twice as much as the fires in the Amazon. Authorities, meanwhile, are struggling to keep pace with the severity of the crisis Stunned Australians are counting the cost from days of catastrophic bushfires that have caused 'extensive damage' across swathes of the country and took the death toll from the long-running crisis to 24. Seaside towns have been plunged into darkness, ash raining down on rural communities and major cities again cloaked in smoke. Neighboring New Zealand has also been blanketed by these fires, with skies turning shades of bright orange like a scene out of an apocalyptic movie. In the state of New South Wales alone, almost 150 fires continued to burn, many out of control, with light rains offering little relief and blazes again touching the suburbs of Sydney. Everywhere, people struggled to come to grips with a catastrophe that has taken place on a near-continental scale, unfurled over months and altered daily life for millions. 'We're in uncharted territory,' New South Wales Premier Gladys Berejiklian said. 'We can't pretend that this is something that we have experienced before. It's not.' Experts say Australia's unprecedented wildfires are supercharged thanks to climate change and the weather. And these fires are so extreme that they are triggering their own thunderstorms. Here are a few questions and answers about the science behind these wildfires. 'They are basically just in a horrific convergence of events,' said Stanford University Environmental Studies Director Chris Field, who chaired an international scientific report on climate change and extreme events. He said this is one of the worst, if not the worst, climate change extreme events he's seen. 'There is something just intrinsically terrifying about these big wildfires. They go on for so long, the sense of hopelessness that they instill,' Field said. 'The wildfires are kind of the iconic representation of climate change impacts.' Is climate change really a factor? Scientists, both those who study fire and those who study climate, say there's no doubt man- made global warming has been a big part, but not the only part, of the fires. Last year in Australia was the hottest and driest on record, with the average annual temperature 1.5 degrees Celsius above the 1960 to 1990 average, according to Australia's Bureau of Meteorology. Temperatures in Australia last month hit 49.9 degrees Celsius. 'What would have been a bad fire season was made worse by the background drying/warming trend,'' Andrew Watkins, head of long-range forecasts at Australia's Bureau of Meteorology, said in an email. Mike Flannigan, a fire scientist at the University of Alberta in Canada, said Australia's fires are 'an example of climate change.' A 2019 Australian government brief report on wildfires and climate change said, 'Human-caused climate change has resulted in more dangerous weather conditions for bushfires in recent decades for many regions of Australia.' How does climate change make these fires worse? The drier the fuel - trees and plants - the easier it is for fires to start and the hotter and nastier they get, Flannigan said. 'It means more fuel is available to burn, which means higher intensity fires, which makes it more difficult - or impossible - to put out,' Flannigan said. The heat makes the fuel drier, so they combine for something called fire weather. And that determines 'fuel moisture,' which is crucial for fire spread. The lower the moisture, the more likely Australian fires start and spread from lightning and human-caused ignition, a 2016 study found. There's been a 10% long-term drying trend in Australia's southeast and 15% long-term drying trend in the country's southwest, Watkins said. When added to a degree of warming and a generally southward shift of weather systems, that means a generally drier landscape. Australia's drought since late 2017 'has been at least the equal of our worst drought in 1902,' Australia's Watkins said. 'It has probably been driven by ocean temperature patterns in the Indian Ocean and the long term drying trend.' Is weather, not just long-term climate, a factor? Yes. In September, Antarctica's sudden stratospheric warming - sort of the southern equivalent of the polar vortex - changed weather conditions so that Australia's normal weather systems are farther north than usual, Watkins said. That means since mid-October persistent strong westerly winds were bringing hot and dry air from the interior to the coast, making the fire weather even riskier for the coasts. 'With such a dry environment, many fires were started by dry lightning events [storms that brought lightning but limited rainfall],' Watkins said. Are people starting these fires? Is it arson? It's too early to tell the precise cause of ignition because the fires are so recent and officials are spending time fighting them, Flannigan said. While people are a big factor in causing fires in Australia, it's usually accidental, from cars and trucks and power lines, Flannigan said. Usually, discarded cigarettes don't trigger big fires, but when conditions are so dry, they can, he said. Are these fires triggering thunderstorms? Yes. It's an explosive storm called pyrocumulonimbus and it can inject particles as high as 10 miles into the air. During a fire, heat and moisture from the plants are released, even when the fuel is relatively dry. Warm air is less dense than cold air so it rises, releasing the moisture and forming a cloud that lifts and ends up a thunderstorm started by fire. It happens from time to time in Australia and other parts of the world, including Canada, Flannigan said. 'These can be deadly, dangerous, erratic and unpredictable,' he said. How can you fight these huge fires? You don't. They're just going to burn in many places until they hit the beach, Flannigan said. 'This level of intensity, direct attack is useless,' Flannigan said. 'You just have to get out of the way ... It really is spitting on a campfire. It's not doing any good.' What does the long-term fire future look like for Australia? 'The extreme fire season in Australia in 2019 was predicted,' said Australian National University climate scientist Nerilie Abram. 'The question that we need to ask is how much worse are we willing to let this get? This is what global warming of just over 1 degree Celsius looks like. Do we really want to see the impacts of 3 degree Celsius or more is like because that is the trajectory we are on.' FACT BOX Size More than 6 million hectares (60,000 square kilometers) - about twice the size of Belgium - have been burned across the country. In comparison, close to 2.5 million hectares of land was burned in August in the Amazon, the world's biggest rainforest. Almost 800,000 hectares were burnt in California in 2018 in one of the U.S. state's worst-ever wildfire seasons. Deaths Some 24 people have died as a result of the bushfires, 17 from the most populous state New South Wales. The death toll for Australia's wildlife is estimated to have hit 480 million in just New South Wales alone, according to a University of Sydney study. Experts fear the loss of animal life could be much higher than the estimates. Homes destroyed More than 1,500 homes have been destroyed so far, but authorities have warned the number is expected to rise. Entire towns in New South Wales and the neighboring state of Victoria were destroyed on New Year's Eve.

Good as the Lamborghini Huracan Evo is, I'll bet every single one of you $10 that I'll like this new, rear-wheel-drive version more. Why? Every time Lamborghini converts one of its all-wheel-drive supercars to a rear-wheel- drive layout, it gets incrementally better -- lighter, a lot more playful and a whole lot less expensive, too. That's the story with the new, unimaginatively named Huracan Evo Rear-Wheel Drive, which Lamborghini debuted on Saturday.
 The Lamborghini Huracan is still, to my eyes, the poster child for what a modern supercar should look like. As stunning now as it was when it first debuted several years ago, the Huracan is aggressive, angular and awesome. With the Evo model, Lamborghini for some reason found it necessary to add extra body bits around the lower front fascia, which kind of kill the original car's clean lines (even if they help with aerodynamics). Happily, Lamborghini took a more restrained approach to the Evo RWD, which adopts a much cleaner schnoz without losing any of that angry curb appeal.
 Power comes from the same, 5.2-liter, naturally aspirated V10 engine as other Huracans, though in the Evo RWD, it's detuned to produce 602 horsepower and 413 pound-feet of torque -- decreases of 29 hp and 29 lb-ft compared to the all-wheel-drive Evo. Complain all you want about the reduction of power, this is still a two-door sports car that makes _more than 600 horsepower_. Trust me, you won't notice the 29-hp discrepancy -- especially considering the Evo RWD is about 75 pounds lighter than its AWD sibling, too.
 Lamborghini retuned the Huracan Evo's Performance Traction Control System for this rear-wheel-drive application, saying the tech will deliver torque to the back wheels "even during the phase where the car is realigning following drifting or side-slipping." The company proudly says the Evo's Sport drive mode makes it so "the rear wheels can slide and skate during acceleration, for easy drifting fun without compromising safety."
 Elsewhere, the Evo RWD is the same as any other Huracan. The interior can be covered in leather or suede, and there's a new, 8.4-inch touchscreen infotainment system in the center console, with Apple CarPlay compatibility.
 The icing on the cake, however, is the price. At $208,571 before destination, the Huracan Evo RWD is some $50,000 less expensive than its all-wheel-drive counterpart. Yeah, that's still a ton of money, but it's not a _ton_ of money. And you're getting more car for the money, anyway. When you look at it that way, it's basically a bargain.

Spending on U.S. health care is out of control, expanding steadily from 5% of GDP in 1960 to 18% in 2018. There are, however, ways to curb the explosion in costs from both the demand and the supply side.
   
 Health care costs per capita in the U.S. are almost double those of other developed countries, but life expectancy is lower than many, even South Korea, according to the CIA and Eurostat. Without restraint, costs will accelerate as more and more postwar babies age. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projects Medicare spending alone will leap from 3% of GDP to 8% by 2090.
   
 Medical costs are understandably high since the system is designed to be the most expensive possible for four distinct reasons. First, with the constantly improving but increasingly expensive modern technology, the best is none too good when your life or mine is at stake. Also, few patients have the knowledge to decide whether a recommended procedure will be medically much-less cost- effective. The medical delivery system encourages a gulf between the providers who supposedly know what's needed and their patients who don't.
   
 Second, patients are quite insensitive to costs since their employers or governments pay most health care bills. And those who are privately insured want to get their money's worth from their premiums, especially since Obamacare does not allow insurers to set premiums on a health risk basis.
   
 Third, the pay-for-service system encourages medical providers to over- service. After my dermatologist burned off the pre-cancerous growths on my face, he wanted me back in two weeks to be sure, but also to bill another office visit.
   
 Finally, domestic training programs and facilities for medical personnel are inadequate. As a result, many MD residents and nurses come from abroad, while medical schools of dubious quality in the Caribbean train U.S.-born physicians.
   
 To control costs on the demand side, use the appeal of money. The importance of their health to most Americans means they will spend proportionally more on medical services than other goods and services, but they'll think twice if it's money they otherwise can keep. Increasing deductibles and co-payments are moving in that direction. In 1999, employees on average paid $1,500, or 22%, of $6,700 in family health coverage premiums, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. The total rose to $26,600 in 2019, but employees' share has climbed to $6,000, or 29%.
   
 Medical savings accounts also make patients more aware of costs. Companies give employees a set amount of money and they can keep what they don't spend on health care.
   
 Accountable Care Organizations, now authorized by Medicare, attack the fee- for-service problem. The medical providers who participate are encouraged to be efficient since they can retain part of any savings due to cost controls as long as they provide excellent care.
   
 To increase the supply of medical personnel, American medical and nursing schools can be expanded with government help. Also, shortening the whole training process would save time and get huge student debts under control. Does a physician need a four-year bachelor's degree before beginning medical school?
   
 Cartels among hospital medical specialties can be attacked. Now, physicians in, say, the general surgery department limit competition by controlling who has the privileges to use their institution's facilities.
   
 In another development, the entrepreneurial model of a small group of MDs operating a practice is fading in the face of high costs of medical record- keeping and other regulatory requirements. Over half of physicians now work for hospitals, either on their main campuses or in satellite facilities. This may shift the emphasis of many from money to medicine.
   
 Medical costs can also be cut by limiting malpractice insurance premiums, a major outlay for medical providers. Texas placed a $250,000 cap on non- economic damages, i.e., pain and suffering, in 2003. Texas Department of Insurance data reveals that medical malpractice claims, including lawsuits, fell by two-thirds between 2003 and 2011, and the average payout declined 22% to $199,000.
   
 Also, average malpractice insurance premiums plunged 46%, according to the Texas Alliance for Patient Access, a coalition of health care providers and physician liability insurers. And physicians were then attracted to Texas. The Texas Medical Association reports that in the decade since malpractice awards were capped, 3,135 physicians came to the Lone Star State annually, 770 more than the average in the prior nine years.
   
 At present, Americans basically pay the development costs of new drugs while other countries with centralized pharmaceutical-buying skip the expenses of R&D;, field trials, etc., and only pay the much-lower marginal cost of production. Allowing Medicare to join Medicaid to negotiate drug prices could reduce costs if foreigners can be convinced to share development costs. Otherwise, new drug development would be curtailed. The Trump administration's new rules that force health insurers and hospitals to publish their negotiated prices may force costs to the lowest level.
   
 One approach that doesn't work in easing the burden on consumers of medical costs is increasing overall government subsidies. They tend to be offset by higher costs, much as more scholarship aid is often dissipated by higher college tuition and fees. Ever notice that the most modern, prosperous institutions in town tend to be hospitals, hugely subsidized by governments?
   
 Health care is critical, but that doesn't mean its costs aren't subjected to supply and demand.

There is a widespread assumption among North Carolina politicos that state policymakers will do little of consequence in 2020. Instead, they will position themselves for the pivotal 2020 elections.
   
 Here's hoping that the Cooper administration and the General Assembly rise above such limited expectations. While the governor and legislative leaders have profound disagreements, and will undeniably choose to take their case to the voters on such issues as tax reform and Medicaid expansion, there are other opportunities for cooperation. For the good of the state, they should act on them.
   
 In no particular order, here are 10 such opportunities for reforming North Carolina government. None seeks to cross an unbridgeable ideological divide. All will require creative legislating and prudent accommodations on details.
   
 First, let's make it easier for North Carolinians to try out a new form of medical practice called direct primary care. Instead of paying or filing claims when you visit your doctor, you pay a membership fee. This reduces the "back office" cost that doctors end up passing along to patients. For direct primary care to fulfill its promise, we need a law clarifying that such membership fees aren't insurance premiums.
   
 Second, let's expand apprenticeship programs. Some schools are rediscovering and expanding on the promise of career and technical education. Let's involve employers more in formal apprenticeships.
   
 Third, in the wake of court-ordered redrawing of legislative and congressional districts for the 2020 cycle, let's make the improvements in our redistricting process permanent by enacting the Fair Act, House Bill 140, which includes a public vote on a constitutional amendment to combat abusive gerrymandering.
   
 Fourth, let's curtail the participation of North Carolina's law-enforcement agencies with the federal government's "equitable sharing" program, which allows governments to confiscate the property of people who have been accused but not convicted of an offense. Being tough on crime does not require being soft on property rights.
   
 Fifth, also on the subject of criminal justice, let's make it a default rule in North Carolina that if you violate the law without knowing it, you lack criminal intent and should not receive criminal penalties.
   
 Sixth, let's make it easier for nurse practitioners to provide critical services, especially in rural areas, by modifying the rule requiring that they work under the (often only theoretical) supervision of physicians, who take a cut of the nurses' revenue.
   
 Seventh, let's submit a constitutional amendment to voters to limit the abuse of eminent domain in North Carolina. Governments should be able to condemn and take property only for a public use, not to convey to another private party for the purposes of "economic development." Both Virginia and Florida have enacted such amendments.
   
 Eighth, let's begin the process of switching the accountability system for North Carolina's public schools to a truly independent, nationally normed test for all relevant grades (the state already administers a national test, the ACT, to high-schoolers). An appropriate step in 2020 would be to authorize the Department of Public Instruction to study suitable tests and make a recommendation by the end of the year.
   
 Ninth, let's make North Carolina's budget more transparent by providing transaction-level detail on state expenditures and revenues on state websites, updated daily.
   
 Finally, let's make it easier for North Carolinians to change careers, and more enticing for people with special skills to move to our state, by reforming occupational licensing. That means both fewer licensing boards and lower costs to acquire professional licenses.
   
 I think some version of each of these ideas could attract bipartisan support. Never know until you try.

Turkish defense exports last year surged by 36.4% compared to 2018 and surpassed $2.7 billion, recording an impressive improvement from $247 million in 2002 Carrying out successful and custom-made projects to diminish the dependency on imported products and platforms, the Turkish defense industry has maintained its significant momentum in exports for the last couple of years. As a result of expedited research and development activities and a range of products, the Turkish defense and aerospace industry carried its export performance to the top in 2019. According to the data obtained from the Turkish Exporters Assembly (Tƒ∞M), the sector's exports soared 34.6% and hit $2.7 billion last year from $2.03 billion in 2018 - the first time defense exports surpassed $2 billion. The defense sales abroad, which totaled $360.3 million, observed the best monthly performance last year. With the goal to decrease dependency on imported products, huge support from the public authorities and the dedication of private companies have led the industry to make significant headway in the post-2006 period. The defense and aerospace sector market had been valued at $1.3 billion in 2002 while exports were recorded at $247 million and R&D expenditures only received $49 million. Turkish defense companies have reached significant economic achievements, a success that is being reflected on international comparison lists. Four domestic defense firms were listed among the world's leading firms, according to a list published by Defense News Top 100 - a U.S.-based magazine that tracks the global defense industry. Turkey's largest defense electronics company ASELSAN ranked 52nd on the list with $1.8 billion in defense revenue, while TAI ($1.05 billion) was listed in the 69th spot. Turkey's Defense Technologies Engineering and Trade Inc. (STM) was 85th on the list with $564.8 million, and Roketsan ($522.8 million) ranked 89th. EXPORTS TO MIDDLE EAST, CIS COUNTRISE SEE SIGNIFICANT RISE The highest proportional increase in defense and aerospace industry exports was seen in free zones with 1,174% followed by the Middle East with a 128% surge and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) with a 104% rise. Exports to countries in the Middle East and CIS nearly doubled, with $710.1 million and $241 million, respectively. The highest export figure of $841.3 million was seen in the North American Free Trade Zone, including the U.S. The Turkish capital Ankara, home to the leading companies in the Turkish defense and aerospace industry, accounted for about half of the exports in this area. Defense and aerospace companies in Ankara carried out exports worth $969.3 million in 2018 and $1.3 billion in 2019, up by 38.9%. Turkey also saw the first export of its domestically developed unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) Bayraktar TB2 to Ukraine. Turkey's drone maker Baykar Makina sold 12 Bayraktar TB2 UAVs to Ukraine. IMPORTANT DEFENSE DEVELOPMENTS IN 2019 The Turkish defense industry carried out intensive work in 2019 to meet the operational needs of the security forces. The Bayraktar Akƒ±ncƒ± Unmanned Combat Aerial Vehicle (Tƒ∞HA), developed by Turkey's leading drone maker Baykar Makina, made its first flight. With the Akƒ±ncƒ± combat drone, Turkey has become one of the four countries in the world in the high-altitude platform sector used for surveillance and security. TAI's Aksungur, a medium-altitude long-flight unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) capable of performing long-term operations at up to 40,000 feet, made its first flight and will be delivered to the Turkish military this month. The first Anka-Ss, which can be controlled via national satellites and mission range reaches thousands of kilometers, were also delivered. The S√ºr√º UAV project was also initiated. The KERKES-Global Positioning System Independent Autonomous Navigation System Development Project, in which UAVs will function in a non- GPS environment, was implemented. The Phase-2 version of the T129 Tactical Reconnaissance and Attack Helicopter (ATAK) helicopter, equipped with a laser warning receiver and other electronic warfare systems, made its first flight successfully. The heavy-class ATAK helicopter project was initiated in 2019 and has already garnered a lot of success. The Turkish military currently has 56 ATAK helicopters in its inventory. The first certification flight of the G√∂kbey helicopter was also conducted last year. Under the General-Purpose Helicopter Program, the first of 109 T70 helicopters to be produced was rolled from the hangar. Under the A400M project, the delivery of the eighth and ninth aircraft was completed. The first T700-TEI-701D engine produced for the T70 helicopter was delivered last year. The Turkish defense industry has achieved great success in 2019 as part of the responsibilities it shouldered in the field of naval platforms. TCG Kƒ±nalƒ±ada, the fourth ship built as part of the national naval ship project (Mƒ∞LGEM), went into service last year and the construction of a fifth ship also started. The multi-purpose amphibious assault ship TCG Anadolu, which will be Turkey's largest warship once complete, was launched. The test and training ship, TCG Ufuk, has also begun operating. Pirireis, the first submarine to be built in the New Type Submarine Project, was towed into a test pool, and workers have begun welding the fifth submarine, Seydialireis. Furthermore, eight speed patrol boats were handed over to security forces. The Preveze Class Submarine Half-Life Modernization Contract was signed between the Turkish Presidency of Defense Industries (SSB), STM, ASELSAN, HAVELSAN and the ASFAT Business Partnership. Final tests of Hisar-A were completed and the air defense system is ready for mass production. The Korkut Air Defense System was added to the military's inventory and 13 systems were delivered. Additionally, G√∂kdeniz was made ready for the system's use on marine platforms. Turkey's first national naval missile, Atmaca, was launched from the TCG Kƒ±nalƒ±ada. The guided firing tests of Bozdoƒüan and G√∂kdoƒüan missiles, developed by TUBITAK SAGE, were successfully carried out within the scope of the G√∂ktuƒü project, which aimed to produce the first domestic and national air-to-air missiles. The development, ground and flight tests of the SOM-B2 missile, which is capable of carrying successive piercing warheads, were also completed in 2019.
