However, experts were confident that Africa is well-positioned to take advantage of lessons learned from other countries and can leverage its strengths. “Given our young population, we have the chance to jump [ahead], skip many trial-and-error phases, and use technologies that are already known to work for social good.” Smart partnerships between governments and private sectors could play an essential role in that regard. “Scientists in the field of AI, for instance, use game theory models to help governments find contextual policies for dealing with emerging technologies.” Participants also reported on attempts to localize or regionalize data collection. “At SMART Africa, an initiative from African heads of state and governments to accelerate sustainable socioeconomic development, we look at two options to tackle this challenge of collecting data. First, a clearly defined roadmap should be set up to arrive at a joint understanding of data as a public asset on a regional level, and second, guidelines and policies need to be developed to open up public data sets.” Others agreed on the vital need for African data ownership, which could be achieved by “share-alike” arrangements that require all actors to give back to society when using open data.

Pakistan is entering a pandemic-induced recession that puts the country’s gross domestic product (GDP) growth at negative 0.2 percent for the financial year that ended in June. When Khan lifted the lockdown on May 9, millions of informal sector workers were unemployed. According to the International Labour Organization (ILO), the battered informal sector normally generates more than 70 percent of the country’s employment outside agriculture. In alarming new projections released by the World Bank, of the 176 million people worldwide expected to be pushed into poverty—making less than $3.20 a day—two-thirds are in South Asia. Meanwhile, Pakistan’s ambitious targets of 2.1 percent GDP growth on the heels of another lockdown set the stage for the compounding disconnect the Khan administration has from the realities on the ground given the most immediate economic disruptions caused by the pandemic. Contrary to Khan’s anti-poverty rhetoric, his recently released 2020-21 budget provided little relief with clear setbacks for programs like the Ehsaas program with further expenditure cuts as revenues will fall short of the ambitious targets. Pakistan’s economy went from experiencing one shock to the next; without a clear and effective response from the government moving forward, the country will need assistance from the IMF, World Bank, and strategic allies like China to resuscitate the country’s economy. The prime minister campaigned as a reformer of the welfare state, the cost of which has led to large budget deficits and a weakened social safety net just when Pakistan needs it most.

Effective July 1, organic food scraps were banned from landfills, as part of Vermont’s Universal Recycling Law. Although many recycling centers and trash haulers still accept food waste, part of the push was to get more Vermonters to compost.
 Overall, it is expected to boost Vermont’s recycling and composting rate from 30% to 60%, which would make it one of the greenest states in the country.
 We’ve all heard the benefits of composting. It improves garden soil by increasing its organic matter. This, in turn, improves soil drainage. Organic matter is especially beneficial in heavy clay or light, sandy soils as it reduces soil crusting and helps soil hold water and nutrients.
 According to literature on the subject, microorganisms decompose materials to make compost.
 There are other benefits. By banning foods scraps, yard debris and clean wood from landfills, far less methane will be released into the air. And the new law is expected to create quite a few new “green” jobs in the state.
 Many trash haulers have had to scramble to become equipped to haul food scraps. And several private companies have started in anticipation of Act 148 going into effect.
 Anyone who wants to compost but who doesn’t have the space will be able to drop off food scraps at various locations. For more information, call the Rutland County Solid Waste District at 802-775-7209 or the Central Vermont Solid Waste Management District at 802-229-9383. (The offices could be closed in observance of the Fourth of July holiday, but their websites are loaded with information.)
 In general, to find out about composting options in your area, contact www.802recycles.com to find your solid waste district, alliance or town.
 While these laws are a win-win for Vermont, they will take some getting used to. Changes in habits and behavior can be challenging. These steps deserve our effort — and patience.
 They will make a big difference in the long run.

So, is Boon actually teasing anything here? Probably not. That's not to say Mileena isn't coming to the game. I think she will, probably as the final DLC character. However, suggesting Boon is teasing this with these tweets is probably looking too deep into things. In fact, just in May Boon suggested we won't be seeing the character in this installment of the series.


  0comments


  "I think over the years, we have about 80 _Mortal Kombat characters_ in some capacity," said Boon while speaking to Game Informer. "The reason we added Fujin was because he hasn't been seen in a game in so long. Quite frankly, I think a decent number of players will be like, "Who's Fujin?" If we just did Mileena, Kitana, Jade, Scorpion, Sub-Zero, Rain, you know, all these characters, I think it would get stale after a while. We do need to give characters a rest every once in a while. Then, when they do return, it's a big deal."

Former Liberty Union High School District students Devon Willis and Nick Sullivan may appear to have few similarities.


  But their recent unexpected deaths in separate incidents show that they both possessed unique qualities that blazed trails into the hearts of many.


  Sullivan, a 2012 Heritage graduate, drowned in mid-June in New Hogan Lake in Calaveras County, while Willis, a 2019 Liberty graduate, was killed on June 21 in a head-on car crash caused by a suspected drunk driver on State Route 4 east of Whiskey Slough Road heading toward Stockton.


  California Highway Patrol officials were unable to provide details on the suspect in Willis’s case this week, other than to say he was transported from the scene to the hospital with major injuries. The investigation is continuing.


  Willis, 20, is remembered as a passionate football player, avid outdoorsman and loyal friend, with an infectious smile, sparkle for life and love of family.


  The Texas native moved to Discovery Bay with his mom in 2016 and made an immediate impact on the Liberty community, his friends and girlfriend said this week.


  He played two seasons for the Lions, helping the team win its first North Coast Section title in 2017.


  His indelible effect on and off the field resounds in the program today, evidenced by a host of current and former teammates and coaches who turned to social media to remember the player nicknamed “Texas.”


  “He was always loyal, always there whenever you needed him,” Trey Hawkins, Willis’s former teammate, said. “That smile, just him alone, would always keep you going.”


  The game aside, Willis lived life to the fullest, said his girlfriend Analiese Almgren.


  The man she described as being “different than anyone she ever met” inspired in her a love of the outdoors and never failed to cook the pair a good meal.


  “He was so different; very gentleman-like,” she recalled. “That is what made me fall in love with him. It was so different from how we were raised out here.”


  Melissa Almgren, Analiese’s mother, remembered Willis as an initially quiet man who quickly opened up to the family, exhibiting polite Southern charm mixed with a fun-loving free spirit.


  Brandie Coleman, Willis’s mom, knew those traits well.


  “Devin presented himself with a tough exterior but really had a tender heart,” she said.


  Willis’s funeral was scheduled for July 2 in his native Texas. Coleman said it’s expected that an East County vigil will be held on July 10, possibly at the Liberty football stadium or City Park.


  Sullivan, 26, was a courageous person with a welcoming soul, laid-back attitude and funny chuckle, his family remembered.


  Meningitis stole his hearing and forced him to relearn to walk as an infant, but he charged forward, leading a normal, rich and fulfilling life, his family said.


  He knew sign language but mostly opted to read lips; attended conventional school; played sports growing up, including basketball and varsity football; and graduated from Sonoma State.


  “A lot of people might see (his challenges) as this huge devastation, where they kind of give up or play the victim,” said Megan Sullivan, Nick’s sister. “Nick never played the victim, never gave up. He lived a normal life.”


  Sullivan, who moved with his family from Camarillo to Brentwood in fourth grade, was an avid outdoorsman but also flourished indoors, especially in social crowds, where his innate ability to make everyone feel welcomed shined, his family said.


  While he was always the life of the party, nothing could compare to the bond he had with his fiance. The pair met on a blind date in Nick’s junior year at Heritage and were inseparable ever since, his family said.


  Luckily, his heart was big enough to include everyone he met.


  “He made everyone feel special,” Megan said. “I don’t know a single person who said Nick didn’t like them.”

Michael Vincent Carbone Sr. passed away in his home on May 26, 2020. Michael was born on Christmas Eve, 1957 in New York City.


  His family – mother, Evelyn “Smitty”; father; Vincent “Vinnie”; and younger brother, Steven – moved to Southern California in his early years where they grew up. His father played in the Glenn Miller Band in the Air Force during WWII and was a personal manager to celebrities like Tommy Dorsey, Bobby Vinton and Frank Sinatra Jr. His mother was an airline stewardess and the sweetest woman you had ever met.


  Michael was a terrific hobby mechanic on bicycles and anything that went fast. Before he was old enough to drive, he was learning gasoline mechanics and had a job at the local garage. He was the shop manager before he finished high school. Back then, with a swarm of local friends, Michael enjoyed all sports and motorsports including local cruising.


  Anyone would agree that Michael had a huge heart and would go to the end of the earth for anyone whose intentions were true. In his younger adult years, Michael built and raced cars or was out fishing the deep waters with his buddy, Mike. He moved up to the Bay Area to raise a family, working for an (and later owning his own) underground construction company. Michael returned to automotive work in the last 10 years. He was proud to work at Monkey Wrenches with Ted and his team. Thank you for everything, Ted.


  Michael loved going RC car racing with his son and they even restored a Stingray Corvette together. They shared a passion for football, and Michael Jr. went on to play college ball and get his bachelor’s degree in business administration and minor in marketing. He was blessed with two wonderful grandsons, Mason and Vinnie, whom he spent many years loving and watching grow. Michael also loved fishing and would take his daughter out to school the boys in how to fish like a real woman. He was proud each time she not only brought home fish, but the jackpot after a day on the ocean. Nicole went on to get a master’s degree in environmental education and teaches on a farm.


  Michael and his wife, Marie, met a little later in their lives and were married for 34 loving years. Their relationship built on trust, understanding and passion was like no other!


  Michael had aggressive bladder cancer and fought it hard for a year. Michael lives on through his beautiful wife, Marie; daughter, Nicole; son, Michael Jr; grandsons, Mason and Vinnie; brother and family, Steven, Michelle, Marco; god- son Teddy and family; and many, many other friends and family members.

 The police suspect that he may have taken his own life somewhere remote, though no body has been found. However, it's also possible that he escaped France--and that possibility has fueled many other potential sightings.

It was his tour of duty in Vietnam that made Bob DeBoever appreciate the American flag and the freedom it represents. It is that pride in his homeland that makes DeBoever known as one of the most patriotic men in Henry County.


   


  When DeBoever was drafted into the military in January of 1966, he didn't know he was going to be a Marine.


   


  The Vietnam Veteran said when he received his draft notice, his orders were to report to Chicago…"It was an open draft," he said. They lined everybody up and every other one of us went to the Marine Corps. It wasn't what I expected."


   


  The 1963 graduate of Geneseo High School was farming on the family farm in Osco when he received the draft notice.


   


  He and his high school sweetheart, the late Judy (Olson) DeBoever, had planned to be married in January of 1966, and DeBoever said, "The lady at the Henry County Courthouse said to me, 'you won't be here in January,' so Judy and I were married in December of 1965."


   


  After completing basic training with the Marine Corps at Camp Pendleton near Oceanside, Calif., DeBoever left for Vietnam in July of 1966.


   


  He said, "We were all told from the beginning that we would be going to Vietnam. The drill instructors were tough on us because the whole idea was to train us to be 'good Marines'."


   


  His first assignment was as a truck driver, but he ended up doing very little of that, he said, and explained, "We were based out of Danang to begin with and then our unit moved to Hoi An. That's where the Marines were based and there was fighting all over the country of Vietnam at that time."


   


  DeBoever said the troops were "in constant danger and I, like everyone else who was there serving their country, was in constant danger.. I went on frequent patrols and was shot at. I lived in fear for the 13 months I was there."


   


  Those experiences made him appreciate home, he said…"After you see how the people live over there and you don't know who can trust because the enemy and good Vietnamese all look alike."


   


  "I got a letter from another member of the Marine Corps who was stationed elsewhere in Vietnam, and someone I met in basic training and he wrote, 'how does it feel to know that you can die any minute over here'. That pretty much sums it up and after seeing how people in that country lived and survived, it made me realize how fortunate we are to live in the United States of America."


   


  "To me, the flag means freedom, national pride and it reminds me to respect our country, our individual rights and our independence," he said.


   


  When he and his wife moved to his present home just west of Geneseo 53 years ago, DeBoever said the couple put up a flag pole and added, "the American flag has flown on that pole ever since."


   


  "I fought for our freedom and when you see how other people live in other countries, some under Communist rule, and who don't have the freedom we do, it makes me realize just how lucky we are to have the freedom we have and we need to appreciate that."


   


  In regard to the current protests, DeBoever said, 'People have the right to protest as long as it is peaceful, not rioting and looting."


   


  He continues to be involved in all aspects of honoring the United States and the American Flag including his devotion to Geneseo's Aisle of Flags when American Flags in memory and in honor of local veterans are placed in Geneseo City Park and North Park. DeBoever is president of the Aisle of Flags, a position he assumed when his wife died in 2018, as she had been president from 2011 until her death.


   


  He recalled the project was started in 1981 by three ladies from the Geneseo VFW Auxiliary who had lost their husbands…"Their husbands' memorial flags that had been on their caskets were put away on shelves in their homes and they wanted to get a program going to show the flags and fly them on Memorial Day, July 4 and Veterans Day, weather permitting.


   


  The Aisle of Flags has grown to include 818 flags and represents 835 veterans because some of the individual flags represent more than one person's name, DeBoever said. The flags in the Aisle of Flags represent veterans who have some connection to the Geneseo area and for more information, contact DeBoever at 309-944-6343.


   


  In addition to his dedication to the Aisle of Flags, DeBoever has been a life member of the Geneseo VFW Post since 1982 and served as commander four times and each of those times he was named All-State Commander. He also is in charge of the Memorial Day program held in Geneseo City Park, is in charge of the registry of all deceased veterans and where they are buried. He also is the person who orders the small cemetery flags for grave markers that are put in place on each veteran's grave on Memorial Day and left there until after Veterans Day.


   


  "I also am in charge of the firing squad for military funerals and I do the flag folding at the funeral and present the flag to the veteran's family," he said.


   


  "I am proud of the American Flag and the freedom it represents, and I am proud to be a Marine," DeBoever said.

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on the entertainment industry, as film and TV productions try to get creative while adhering to social distancing guidelines. One of the projects that has risen out of the pandemic is _Songbird_ , an upcoming low-budget thriller produced by Michael Bay that is expected to film in Los Angeles -- but has apparently been hit with a major setback. According to a new report from Variety, the performers union SAG-AFTRA has issued a "do not work" order for _Songbird_ , while telling its members to refuse work on the film.


  The order reportedly was sent to On A Lark Productions LLC, saying that the company has failed to complete the signatory process and is therefore not signed to any applicable SAG-AFTRA agreement. The organization warned its members that they could potentially be disciplined if they work on the film.


  "As such, SAG-AFTRA members are hereby instructed to withhold any acting services or perform any covered work for this production until further notice from the union," SAG-AFTRA said in the report. "Please note, accepting employment or rendering services on _Songbird_ ; may be considered a violation of Global Rule One. Violating this order may result in disciplinary action in accordance with the SAG-AFTRA Constitution."


   _Songbird_ is described as being "in the spirit of _Paranormal Activity_ and _Cloverfield,_ " and takes place two years into a potential future where the coronavirus pandemic "has not gone away". As lockdowns are reinstated and the virus continues to mutate, the characters of the film bein to focus on a government conspiracy and widespread paranoia. A previous report indicated that although the project is a found-footage movie, its cast of actors would never be in the room together during filming. The production would adhere to strict social distancing measures with the scenes shot after the crew has prepared the shot and left the room. In addition, they say there would be no scenes with actors "face to face," noting that they don't intend for this to be like the "all on a computer screen" thriller, _Searching_.


  0comments


  The film is directed by Adam Mason (Hulu's _Into the Dark_ ), who co-wrote the script with Simon Boyes.


  It's unclear how SAG-AFTRA's order against _Songbird_ will ultimately affect the movie, especially as no actors have officially been cast for the film. This hurdle is just the latest logistical problem that has impacted film and TV sets amid the pandemic, even as some productions are getting ready to restart filming in places like Vancouver, the UK, and New Zealand.

Most participants saw Africa as a blank slate for innovation, meaning that AI applications are not yet constrained by extant legal systems. “The continent has the advantage of just letting innovators do what they need to do before regulators adapt and get on board.” Of course, these circumstances are a double-edged sword, as others were quick to mention. “Africa does indeed provide a really good testing bed for AI applications, but this is exactly the reason why governments need to be careful. If there’s no framework, no digital infrastructure, no laws and regulations, it’s like an open playing field without security measures and consumer protection.” Another expert went one step further and warned of potential bad investors bringing dangerous technologies into the African market. “By the time governments catch on, it might be too late. Ultimately, there’s a need for strengthened, more robust legal systems, and until these get set up, consumers are at risk of abuse.” The expert continued by encouraging knowledgeable technologists to speak truth to power, to be a voice for people who don’t have many insights into the subject matter, and to educate them. Following that strain of thought, another speaker added that, regarding policies and regulations, the private sector is already light years ahead of the public sector anyway, which creates very different playing fields. “It’s not a question of _if_ AI is coming, but _when_ it is going to transform societies significantly. Be it increasing automation or new privacy concerns, governments really need to fully understand the extent of the changes, so that they can act, counter, and mitigate negative externalities.”

OELWEIN — “Knee high by the Fourth of July” is an old adage farmers across the country use to measure the success of a corn crop. It’s exact origin isn’t clear, but it has been repeated each July for decades.
 Back in the day, the phrase meant the corn was doing well and a good harvest was in sight. But by today’s standards, if corn is only knee high by July 4, there might be something significantly wrong with the crop.
 Les and Bettie Fox live about three miles west and a mile and a half north of Oelwein. Their stand of corn is well over their heads, far beyond the rhyming measurement.
 The couple has farmed his grandmother’s farm all their 40-plus years of married life, and for Les, since before he served his country in the U.S. Army during the Vietnam War.
 “We used to rent more ground and also raised beef, but now we just focus on the home farm, which is 94 acres,” Les said.
 In addition to farming, Les also worked 10 years for DeKalb and 17 years at Transco before retiring. He still maintains a job as seed salesman for AgVenture, which he has done for many years.
 Les says every farmer has his own way or “spring planting routine.” Some farmers stick by a certain date before they will begin planting. He knew one area farmer who would never put a seed in the ground before his May 10th birthday. Some go by the Farmer’s Almanac, and others use a combination of superstition and family tradition.
 “The ground tells me when it’s time to plant,” Les said. “When the ground temperature gets to 50° I can plant corn.”
 Bettie referenced her crop journal and noted, “We planted corn this year on April 22 and beans on April 26.” She was quick to point out that genetics and breeding in corn these days makes the seed much different than it used to be, which means pretty much every farmer should have at least knee high corn by the first week in July.
 Les takes a more matter-of-fact approach to getting a good corn crop. He said that although Mother Nature can throw a curve, getting a good crop means working for it, and he is “old school” when it comes to that.
 He still cultivates one pass through on all of his crop fields and has never made the switch to no-till, as many others have done.
 “This soil is so dense through here that I don’t feel I have to worry about erosion,” Les said, explaining his practices. “I also plow every fall after the harvest, to turn the soil over and let it breathe before winter.”
 “Cultivating corn helps improve its growth,” Bettie said. “We’ve had a pretty good start to the growing season so far, although there was a little hail damage recently.”
 Les said the area has seen plenty of rain and it’s time for a dry spell.
 “We need about two weeks of dry weather. The corn plants are getting tall, but the roots don’t have to stretch down into the soil to get moisture. To support the tall plants, the roots need to grow down for a strong hold, otherwise, a strong wind will topple them over,” he said.
 “No one is ever a bigger gambler than a farmer. The whole year is always a gamble,” Bettie said.
 Les looked out over their well-kept yard and adjoining cornfields, with the neatly trimmed grass lines and ditches, a picturesque reflection of a proud Iowa farmer. Knowing well, the hazardous that too much optimism can have in his years of farming experiences, he ventures a calculated response to how he thinks this crop year compares to other years.
 “Looks promising,” he said with a grin.

While much of Blooming Prairie’s annual Independence Day celebration has been cancelled, fireworks will still take place as usual Saturday night at Victory Field.
 A “No Button ‘Button Sale’” will also be up and running through the weekend, with collection jars set up at a number of area businesses to help fund next year’s Old Fashioned Fourth of July. According to organizers, roughly 10% of festival expenses are typically covered by button sales.
 “We will also be doing some fundraising next year, but proceeds like the money from the parade units, our button and beer sales are all used to start up the next year’s festival,” said Becky Noble, executive director of the Blooming Prairie Area Chamber of Commerce.
 Noble said she also sent out a mailing to people in and around town asking for help fundraising for next year’s festival. Overall, she added that the pandemic has caused a slowdown in sponsorships as businesses and individuals try to weather the economic impact.
 The chamber announced the decision to forego this year’s festival in early May, with Noble citing the cancellation of the Austin Fourth of July parade as one of the final things to tip the balance. She added at the time that both Blooming Prairie and Austin share a lot of the same parade units, and that many of these groups were already making the decision to not do summer parades as they were unable to meet and practice this spring.
 “They need to practice,” added Noble. “One big reason that it was called off is that the parade units weren’t going to come, because they have bands that weren’t able to get together to practice.”
 Still, fireworks are able to happen and will take place as usual the night of the Fourth. Noble said residents will be able to watch from Victory Field, just across Main Street from the high school, or from the First Lutheran Church parking lot across the street. While she said many should be able to see the display from their cars or driveways, those that do get out are encouraged to keep a safe distance between households.
 “It always starts on time,” Noble added, “and it’s usually done in 20 to 25 minutes.”
 Other fireworks displays in the area include the Early Edition Rotary show at the Steele County Fairgrounds in Owatonna and the Faribault Fireworks at the Rice County Fairgrounds in Faribault. All three displays will start at 10 p.m.

NEW YORK (AP) — A Manhattan federal lockup failed to implement common-sense measures to protect prisoners after a COVID-19 outbreak infected dozens of inmates at the facility, a judge said Thursday.


  U.S. District Judge Edgardo Ramos said four inmates who sued over conditions at the Metropolitan Correctional Center on behalf of themselves and others were unlikely to prove deliberate indifference to their plight. Still, the Manhattan jurist allowed their lawsuit to proceed in their quest to improve conditions at the jail and win release for vulnerable inmates.


  Arlo Devlin-Brown, a lawyer for inmates, said in an email that it was notable that the judge cited the fact that the facility's warden has promised to address shortcomings as he observed that “the MCC may fall short in its efforts to improve its pandemic response.”


  “Time will tell whether the MCC practices what it preaches," Devlin-Brown said. “The lawsuit is not over, and we'll continue our efforts to hold the MCC accountable should it fail to take necessary measures to minimize the spread of this deadly virus within its walls and treat with proper care those who are sickened by it."


  A spokesperson for government lawyers declined to comment.


  “The inmates are likely to show that the MCC’s response to the pandemic was ad hoc and overlooked many gaps in its scheme to identify and isolate infected inmates — creating conditions that posed a substantial risk to the health of all inmates," Ramos said.


  He noted that at least 5% of the MCC's more than 700 inmates contracted the coronavirus in March and April.

The driver of the other boat, Damion Bruno, 41, was sentenced in February to 30 years in prison. He pleaded guilty to two counts of reckless murder. Court records show Bruno had been drinking. During his sentencing, he tearfully apologized to the families involved.“When we went to court, we forgave him,” said Fuller. Meanwhile, she says, a civil suit that was filed in the case is now in the process of being settled.In her garage, Fuller has a corner dedicated to the memory of her son.

Por isso, qualquer proposta democrática encampada por FHC perde completamente o sentido. Bolsonaro e FHC são parte do mesmo processo. Um é a consequência do outro", diz Attuch.

The global pandemic response and subsequent uncertainty regarding supplies of medicine, personal protective equipment, and commercial goods have prompted governments worldwide to increasingly view global supply chains as a matter of national security. The government of India has reacted to these pressures with varying levels of protectionist responses intended to secure supplies of medicine and reduce reliance on imports. Throughout its tenure, the Modi government has exhibited a combination of protectionist and industry-oriented tendencies intended to develop domestic firms while attracting foreign direct investment in manufacturing. In light of Modi’s remarks on May 12—in which he stated, “the corona crisis has taught us the value of local manufacturing, local markets, and local supply chains”—and the escalating political rhetoric of strategic independence from China, economic policy discussions in New Delhi appear to increasingly be turning inward. Faced with its first economic contraction in nearly four decades and extreme economic disruption from the COVID-19 pandemic, the Modi government appears inclined to increasingly turn to industrial policy reminiscent of import-substitution to promote domestic industry and discourage foreign firms. As the world’s fifth-largest economy and largest single market, any move to further disentangle India from existing global supply chains will have significant implications for international business and the global economy for decades to come.

A 60-year-old Wayne man chiseled his way into a township fertilizer store before dawn Thursday as an employee watched on surveillance video, said police who then caught the burglar inside.


  Officers were responding to a burglar alarm shortly before 3 a.m. when the employee of Wayne Wholesale Fertilizer in the township’s Mountain View section called police headquarters and said he’d seen an intruder on video.

“At this point of mid-June, I personally am still without guidance about details,” Cover said.


  “More than a few details of implementation are unclear to me, but none of these currently strike me as insurmountable.”


  He acknowledged that no one can assure his absolute safety, but said he feels assured that for the most part, the students he teaches are good kids and will respect their professors.


  He said that by asking students to follow demanding regulations, the University is giving students a chance to demonstrate their “greatness.”


  “Maybe Purdue is special. If it isn’t, why not do our best to make it so, by asking much rather than little,” Cover said. “I say, let’s trust them to be as good as we tend to think we ourselves are.”


  He feels face-to-face learning, if done responsibly, is the best-case scenario.


  “In my view, being on the other end of some remote learning platform is distant enough to be absent,” Cover said. In his view, students and teachers need to meet in person for a successful learning experience.


  “I love my time in class with students,” he said, “and can only dread the idea of losing it by halves or more.


  “I still don’t see clearly how our classroom populations are to get thinned down. It’s starting to sound like professors will be asked to teach face to face and also, thank you, remotely as well, at twice the labor for half the effect.”


  Along with uncertainty about how fall schedules will be altered for professors, Cover said he also worries about the technological aspects of switching to a hybrid, or fully online, option for teaching.


  “For an old technically challenged Luddite like myself, who has spent 35 years in the direction of seeing the face-to-face classroom experience as an optimal one for real learning,” he said, “the six weeks of Spring 2020 nearly ruined me.


  “I have taught at Purdue over 30 years — and briefly in New York before that — and cannot recall any past health scares that precipitated responses comparable to those we are witnessing and experiencing now with COVID-19.


  “I am a somewhat animated, chalk-throwing professor, and I also distribute good old helpful handouts, and return good old covered-in-red-ink assignments back to students, and ask students to hand in good old-fashioned written work, and so on,” Cover said.


  “What concerns me most is that for some reason we shall, as an institution of higher learning, be forced to give up on the really good idea of having live students in front of us in our classrooms, to genuinely teach in the way we know works best,” he said.


  “More selfishly, I am concerned that some fairly last-minute expectations shall descend upon us, as instructors, to adjust in non-face-to-face directions, and be left largely to fend for ourselves in trying to accomplish it — largely in technical matters that are well beyond our skill set.


  “It does astonish me that as yet, I see no moves in the direction of greatly increasing video capabilities in many rooms to capture classroom sessions. Doubtless this would be expensive, but even in the best of times, the direction in which things are trending makes it a fine investment, to capture more of course content happening up in front of the students.”


  “I still seriously doubt if every classroom, come August, will enjoy a Plexiglas shield between instructor and students,” he said, “I hope I’m wrong.”


  “Unless norms and expectations seriously change between now and August, I will wear a mask, even while teaching, because it is the right thing to do.


  “I hate the masks, and can’t project my voice nearly so well — never mind loss of the hugely important facial-communication dimension — and despise that claustrophobic sense it creates when I’m operating at full speed; but yes, of course, for sure, come hell or high water, I will do for others what I wish them to do for me.”


  Cover said that if students and faculty wish to be successful with the Protect Purdue Plan, people should take it upon themselves to make these changes the new “culture of behavior.”

The significant lack of data causes hardship for software developers. “As a continent, we have to do the necessary groundwork, given the increasing need for African data to manage and solve African problems. Substitutes with US or other foreign data are no longer sufficient, if we want local AI applications to work properly.” According to speakers, an additional obstacle is the politicization of data and AI, which has increased over the years. “Gathering information and collecting data always happen in a context, which makes things difficult, particularly if they occur in an authoritative regime. Can factors like location and proximity, for instance, indicate political leanings,” one participant asked. Experts further highlighted the fact that there is a fear, particularly in authoritative governments, that tech enables opposition forces, describing it as  “a situation that often leads to excessive regulation and the elimination of social media platforms — measures that ultimately hamper the drive for technological innovation.”

Despite temporary suspensions of some accessions of new recruits into boot camp, the armed forces have now restored their personnel pipelines. That is crucial because, even though a tough economy should ease the challenges of both recruiting and retention, today’s all-volunteer force needs to replace about 15 percent of its people every year. To date, there is no indication of any big problem in this area, though it will be important to see how springtime recruiting trends go, since the armed forces depend on signing up large numbers of recent high school grads in the warmer months.

Start with the simplest metric: Out of just over 2 million Americans in uniform today, counting 1.3 million active-duty as well as National Guard and Reserve personnel, less than 5,000 have tested positive for COVID-19 (as of May 4, in information provided by Secretary of Defense Mark Esper when I interviewed him that day). That incidence rate is about two-thirds the national average. But because the military is predominantly young, serious cases are much less prevalent than in American society. There have been fewer than 100 hospitalizations and just two deaths to date—less than 1 percent the per capita rate in the United States writ large. Also, while the Theodore Roosevelt did function as a sort of petri dish for the spread of the virus, most military units are somewhat isolated from those urban centers where the coronavirus has hit the hardest to date. As Secretary Esper told me, a deployed ship is actually a great place to avoid COVID-19 provided that no one on board has it!

In recent weeks Lake Eufaula has seen pressure from some of the best pros in the sport. The lake has produced huge weights time and time again. It was time for the best teams in Southeast to take their turn on the lake when the Alabama Bass Trail South Division converged on Lake Eufaula. Going against the norm, the team of Shane Powell and Tim Fox did things a little different to win with 26.22 pounds.


  Shane and Tim went against the grain and started out the morning deep. They went to work fishing a roadbed. Tim said, he “was really surprised they had the whole spot to themselves.” It is a well-known community area that stretches out for a couple miles, and they were able to locate a stretch that quickly produced 19 pounds. In practice they noticed “the fish were really feeding out deep early.” Making the decision to go deep early when a good majority of the field went shallow was unique. Timing proved to be a deciding factor because when they returned later in the morning to check the roadbed again, it didn’t produce a bite.


  Once the sun came out, the bite died down on the roadbed, so they moved to their second spot where they fished out a little deeper to the ledges. There they used a 10XD and upgraded a few times. Shane said there “were still large schools of fish there.” Shane also said they continued to notice “they had areas completely to themselves because guys were still up shallow”


  At the end of the day Shane and Tim switched up and moved shallow. Using a white ½ oz War Eagle spinnerbait they targeted shallow water brush piles. Shane said, “we could see shad busting the surface on the top of the brush piles.” He felt “with it being so hot the key was to use a smaller bait to get down in the brush pile and the fish would knock slack in their line. The fish didn’t really want a big bait, and those two fish in the last hour really catapulted us up to the top.”
