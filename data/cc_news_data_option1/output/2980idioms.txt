On July 17, the nation said goodbye to C.T. Vivian and John Lewis, giants of our time. Both men were born when opportunities for African-Americans were restricted by law. In the face of Black Codes, Jim Crow laws and indiscriminate lynching that kept racial segregation firmly in place, these men refused to be denied the promises articulated in the founding documents of this nation.
   
 At a young age they were on the frontlines of the modern Civil Rights Movement and sacrificed all to join history making battles for the constitutional right to vote for African-Americans.
   
 The Brown Foundation was honored to share the company of these two men. We hosted Congressman Lewis in Topeka on three occasions. I first met him in 1992 when I was working on the bill to establish Brown v. Board National Historic Site. He joined me in testifying before a Congressional Committee that oversees National Parks.
   
 Their passing calls on us to compare the pervasive indifference of the current administration with activism of past decades that demanded accountability of government leaders. Activism that swayed public opinion and positively influenced federal legislation. To honor the memory of C.T. Vivian and John Lewis we must vote Nov. 3. Voter suppression is about fear. Fear of the majority losing power. Fear of people of color freely voting for what is in our best interest.
   
 As we traverse the months leading to election day. The courage of C.T. Vivian and John Lewis must be our North Star.

The formation of brain proteins, amyloid and tau, into clumps of amyloid plaques and tau tangles are defining physical features of Alzheimer's disease, but they are hard to detect without expensive PET scans or invasive spinal taps, neither of which is routinely covered by insurance.
 Doctors are left with verbal and written tests of memory and cognitive impairment, combined with interviews with patients' family members and caregivers about their behavior. That approach makes it tough to accurately diagnosis Alzheimer's as distinct from other types of cognitive impairment.
 In addition, brain scans and spinal taps can only identify beta amyloid plaques, not the tau protein. A test for tau is important, experts say -- beta amyloid alone isn't enough to diagnose Alzheimer's because some people with high levels don't develop the neurological disease.
 The new blood test is able to detect both amyloid plaques and tau tangles and is very specific to Alzheimer's, experts said.
 A third abstract presented at the Alzheimer's conference found the test could differentiate between less common frontotemporal dementia, which affects younger people and leads to changes in behavior and personality rather than memory loss, and Alzheimer's, illustrating the test's diagnostic abilities. These include changes in personality, behavior and difficulties with language.
 "These studies (and others) show that blood based tau is a marker of amyloid pathology. Very interesting and not what would have been predicted 5 years ago," said John Hardy, the chair of Molecular Biology of Neurological Disease at University College London.
 These advances mean a day may come in the next few years when your health care provider can do a blood test for Alzheimer's while you are at the doctor's office, experts say.
 "It is very exciting, because we all know that blood tests are really important and they're necessary as a first pass in the clinic, in your general practitioner's office," said Maria Carrillo, chief medical officer of the Alzheimer's Association.
 And unlike current detection methods, blood tests could more easily be scaled up to test many people at much lower cost.
 Early detection and treatment before significant damage from Alzheimer's disease occurs to the brain would be a game changer for individuals, experts said. The test could also help to identify the right people for clinical drug trials.
 "We know that brain changes in Alzheimer's disease can occur decades before symptoms start to show and the early stages of disease are likely to be the time when future drugs are most effective," Sancho said.
 Carrillo and other experts caution that while promising, the blood test still needs to be tested among asymptomatic people and larger populations.
 "Now we need longer and larger studies to validate these results and find out if this test could accelerate our ability to develop new treatments for Alzheimer's disease in the future." said Fiona Carragher, director of policy and research at Alzheimer's Society in the UK.
 Ballard agrees: "Although this research looks extremely promising, further validation in people from more routine clinical settings are still needed, and a lot of work will be needed to achieve standardisation of the test across laboratories.
 "So it could still be at least five years before we see an accurate blood biomarker test for dementia it in the clinic."

It’s no secret that young teams play better at home where they are more familiar with their surroundings and are not subject to the conditions of a hostile crowd. Trae Young, Collins, De’andre Hunter, Kevin Huerter, and Cam Reddish led the Hawks in minutes per game this season. None of these five players have celebrated their 23rd birthday yet. Collins was in his third-year in the league, Young and Huerter were only in their second-year, and Hunter and Reddish were rookies. The youth of the Hawks’ core is reflected in the disparity between their performances at home and their performances on the road. The Hawks scored 114.6 points per game at home but just 108.8 points per game on the road. The Hawks surrendered 117.4 points per game at home compared to 122.2 points per game on the road. With a young nucleus Hawks fans should have something to look forward to in the future and may even be the consensus pick as the NBA team with the most potential moving forward.

 Kansas is fortunate to have the talented, highly trained Lee Norman leading the Kansas Department of Health and Environment during a public health crisis.
 When Gov. Laura Kelly met with the editorial board in the weeks prior to the general election in 2018, she impressed on board members that her commitment to hiring qualified people to run state agencies made her worthy of election to the state's highest office.
 Kelly stressed the importance of needing highly competent agency secretaries, not political appointees, and vowed she would leave politics out of the selection process.
 After leadership failures by many of former Gov. Sam Brownback's appointees, there was no question the state needed competent leadership in every agency. She's delivered on her promise in many ways, but Lee Norman has proved exceptionally capable.
 His life's work has essentially prepared him for this moment. Norman served in the U.S. Air Force as a family physician, flight surgeon and combat medicine instructor and later a family physician in Seattle. In addition to his training and education to become a physician, he has an executive MBA and a master's degree in health planning and systems analysis.
 Norman also has extensive military training that is undoubtedly helpful as the state adapts its response to the pandemic. He's a colonel in the Kansas Army National Guard and guides medical troop sustainment and training, health services support, force health protection, biosecurity and serves as adviser and liaison to the Kansas Department of Emergency Management and Homeland Security.
 It's hard to imagine a person better suited for the job during a global pandemic.
 We've come to rely on Norman for his frank advice and stern admonishments when Kansans aren't heeding best practices. Take for instance his tweet on July 21: \"Time for some plain talk. Schools can't be 'safe islands' in an unsafe community. Counties and cities who don't use the proven measures to reduce spread of Covid-19 ask schools and hospitals to fix their sloppiness and mistakes, which is wrong to do. The virus will find a way in.\"
 Since March, Secretary Norman and the folks at KDHE and the Department of Emergency Management have worked tirelessly to deploy resources, educate the public and scale up testing (in an outdated state lab). It's been a thankless job but one that deserves heaps of gratitude and recognition.
 If you're looking for more information about COVID-19 or you're feeling uncertain about what information you can trust, check out what Norman has to say. Thank you, Secretary Norman, for the commitment of you and your team to keep Kansans safe and healthy.

An invigorating blend of beer, gambling and... the police. What could go wrong?
 Well, thankfully nothing went too sideways last week on Beacon Hill. But if you were wondering whether legislative leaders could bring the two-year session in for a smooth landing before the end of the month, the evergreen answer became obvious.
 Don't bet on it. At least not yet.
 It turns out there's still time for a lawmaker to add betting on the Legislature to a sports wagering proposal that House leaders baked into a massive jobs bill released Friday. Could be fun, right?
 But seriously, the money-making sports wagering proposal hadn't been on the lips of too many legislators in recent months when it suddenly found its way into an end-of-session economic development bill.
 The sport betting proposal was released on Opening Day of the baseball season, when Gov. Charlie Baker was planning to be at Fenway Park on Friday night to help throw out the first pitch of the Red Sox opening tilt against the nine (but really 10) from Baltimore. Earlier in the week, Red Sox counsel and former Robert Travaglini top advisor David Friedman testified that sports betting was "low-hanging fruit" worth as much as $50 million a year to the state and advertising revenue for the team.
 And with the Department of Revenue reporting that June tax collections missed budgeted benchmarks by $761 million, some lawmakers are probably thinking the state could use a few million extra dollars right about now.
 That same bill released by House Ways and Means on Friday also included the governor's long-sought zoning reforms, which he says will make it more likely that needed housing development will occur in Massachusetts.
 But before there can be a vote on that bill, the House needs to finish with the deliberations over its sweeping version of police reform that would create a brand new commission to oversee the licensing of police officers and the enforcement of new standards that would ban chokeholds and limit the use of tear gas and no-knock warrants.
 The debate over policing was on its third day on Friday, and Rep. Paul Tucker, a former Salem police chief, had promised at the start a vote "with the sun shining."
 It was a not so subtle dig at the Senate, where legislators finished debate in one session, but that session ended after 4 o'clock in the morning. His snarky comment was also made Wednesday, when the sun set without a vote. It rose and set again on Thursday. Still no vote.
 House lawmakers, however, were using that time to work through some complex and emotional issues, none more so than the use of no-knock warrants. The no- knock execution of a warrant in Louisville, Kentucky, has been blamed, in part, for the shooting death by police of Breonna Taylor.
 And though House leaders had proposed to limit their use in Massachusetts, Rep. Liz Miranda strengthened that provision by making sure a no-knock warrant could not be issued if police had reason to believe minors or seniors were in the home.
 Rep. Timothy Whelan, a retired state trooper from Cape Cod, said a no-knock warrant had probably saved his life while on the job, but Miranda's amendment passed on a rare close vote of 83-76.
 The duration of the House's debate highlights just how sensitive the issue of police reform has become, and how challenging it could be to get a bill done by July 31 that Gov. Charlie Baker would be willing to sign - assuming Democrats don't move to extend formal sessions beyond Friday.
 It appears a virtual certainty that some accommodation outside the House and Senate's rules will need to be made to get a budget complete for fiscal 2021. But there's hope among leaders that other priorities can be tied up with a bow before Friday.
 The Senate made quick and unanimous work of a compromise struck over the previous weekend to end a 10-year feud between craft brewers and beer distributors over the rights of brewers to sever their ties to a distributor if they're unhappy with how their brand is being marketed.
 The House also released legislation to enshrine some of the gains made during the pandemic in promoting the use of telehealth in what could be that branch's response to the Senate's health care trilogy this session, that also included prescription drug cost controls and mental health reform.
 While there is still a bill pending, Baker extended the moratorium on evictions and foreclosures by two months, and filed another one-month budget bill to keep the lights of government on through August while he and legislative leaders wait for Congress to decide on another COVID-19 relief package. The budget relief sought by states to the tune of $500 billion was expected to come up when Baker met with Vice President Mike Pence on Nantucket Saturday.
 The two Republicans planned to sit down to discuss the pandemic, but Baker was to skip the high-dollar fundraiser at the home of Putnam Investments CEO Robert Reynolds in the afternoon.
 A full-year budget for Massachusetts won't be ready by the end of the month, but Baker said in the "coming weeks" he and the Democrats in control of the House and Senate should be ready to announce an agreement on local aid for the year that will enable City Halls and school districts to finally plan their spending for the rest of the fiscal year.
 Schools have until the end of next week to submit their reopening plans and many are struggling with the idea of returning students in-person to the classroom and questions about how to do that safely.
 Boston Mayor Marty Walsh said he favors a "blended" approach that would mix in-person teaching with remote learning, and that may be necessary after the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education released new busing guidelines that call for students to wear masks, keep windows open and sit one child per bench, which would greatly reduce the capacity of buses.
 On the topic of social distancing, Baker also said that if people couldn't behave themselves last weekend or in the future and stop crowding on beaches, the state would have to start enforcing capacity limits.
 "That's not something we want to do," Baker said, noting towel-to-towel crowds during last weekend's heat wave in places like M Street beach in South Boston. "We want people to simply use their heads and be responsible."
 Baker said Massachusetts residents, for the most part, continue to do well to control the spread of the coronavirus, but the same can not be said for other parts of the country. That was the reason Baker gave on Friday for reversing course and issuing a mandatory quarantine order for people traveling into Massachusetts from most other states, where infection and positive test rates are climbing.
 Unless you come from Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey or Hawaii, visitors must now quarantine for 14 days upon arrival or show proof of a negative COVID-19 test within the previous 72 hours. Failure to comply can result in fines of $500 a day.
 The travel restrictions would apply to college students due to begin arriving next month from around the country on campuses that are offering in-person instruction this fall.
 In light of and despite of the pandemic, the University of Massachusetts Board of Trustees went along with President Marty Meehan's recommendation this week to freeze tuition for not just the system's 48,000 in-state undergraduates spread across four campuses, but 9,500 graduate students as well.
 This step was taken even though the university said it is facing a $264 million budget gap blown wide open by the COVD-19 pandemic, and implementing cuts that the Massachusetts Teachers Association called "destructive" and vowed to fight.
 Needless to say, it was a long week, and this week could be longer, But at least Gov. Baker signed a cocktails to-go law last week enabling restaurants to put some spirit into their take-out.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Big gaps in federal oversight of long-term care facilities for aging veterans may have contributed to rampant coronavirus infections and more than 200 deaths at state-run homes, according to a congressional watchdog agency.
 The Government Accountability Office found the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs failed to require robust inspections at the 148 state-run veterans homes nationwide and to make sure all deficiencies were rectified, even as it regularly doled out federal dollars for the care.
 That likely made a bad situation worse in places like the Soldiers’ Home in Holyoke, Massachusetts, one of 50 veterans homes nationwide where VA is the only federal agency monitoring it, according to GAO. A recent investigation conducted for the state of Massachusetts found the superintendent there was not qualified to run a long-term care facility, and that officials with a state agency were aware of his “shortcomings,” but failed to do enough about it.
 By law, VA is barred from making federal payments until facilities meet standards of quality care.
 “VA needs to continue to strengthen its oversight,” Sharon Silas, director of health care at GAO, told a House hearing Wednesday in written testimony. Her team is conducting a wider investigation of VA’s oversight into the facilities in light of surging coronavirus deaths.
 “It is imperative that VA ensure the health and safety of these veterans,” she said.

“Every day, they know they could be abducted, detained and held for ransom. Every day, they struggle to earn a living to make ends meet,” said Tom Garofalo, director of the International Rescue Committee in Libya.

Within the context, the Italian coast guard took responsibility for coordinating the rescue operation and sent the ASSO 29 vessel, serving the platforms of the Italian oil and gas giant Eni, to help the people in distress. The operation took about half an hour and ended at 02:35 GMT on Wednesday with 84 people, including six women and two children, being saved, the authority said.
 As of now, the vessel is heading for the Italian island of Lampedusa, where one of the temporary centers for migrants is located. However, the situation in this center is critical, as there are already about 1,000 refugees, while it is designed for only 95 people.
 Over recent weeks, the flow of migrants from North African countries to the coast of Italy has increased sharply due to improved weather conditions. Rescue operations at sea and landing of refugees ashore take place every day.

CCSD had mapped out a mixed methodology to its approach and that concept passed by vote with the board of trustees. The original plan called for two days of in-person schooling and three days of distance learning (online learning from home). As was the issue during the height of the COVID pandemic, when the children are schooling from home, so too must a parent, (or a guardian) also be present, thus placing a financial strain on households in which both parents work. Either one of them has to quit their job, find a way to work from home or they must hire a caregiver for them thus causing added financial strain on the household.
 On July 21, in a slight reversal of their previous position on mixed in- class/home-school approach, the Clark County School District Board of Trustees voted unanimously for students to start off the school year with full distance learning. Trustees claimed after a lengthy meeting the decision was “dictated’ by health concerns and a climb in COVID-19 cases in the Vegas Valley.”
 “Hospitals have been reporting a rising trend in hospital ICU bed occupancy and ventilator use until about the last 24 hours with a slight decline noted,” said Linda Kalekas, health services coordinator for CCSD.
 CCSD staff are now emphasizing the need to address rising COVID cases in Nevada and surrounding states when they came to that vote to start off the school year fully online for students. The school year will also be set back to a start date of Aug. 24.
 Dr. Linda Young, of the CCSD Board of Trustees, said, “I’m going to be blunt, I’m really frustrated,” adding, “We’ve been talking about broadband access and connectivity and then give out survey that many people in my community can’t even do the survey because they don’t that access. They don’t have connectivity. They don’t have devices — and it’s like we’ve been doing this almost three months.”

Pino Vitale, ex ds dell'Empoli, ha parlato a TMW di Inter e Atalanta ora a caccia del secondo posto, ma si è soffermato anche sul mercato: "La squadra di Gasp ha tutto da guadagnare dallo scontro con l'Inter. La formazione di Conte deve continuare a migliorare e quindi arrivare seconda sarebbe per lei importante. L'Atalanta è cresciuta grazie a Gasp ma soprattutto grazie alla società, con un grande ds come Sartori che sa scegliere i giocatori. E' uno dei migliori. In CL può anche vincere, non mi meraviglierei".

We are now on the final lap. With the announcement this week prior to the August Bank Holiday weekend of both the Noughties and Nineties teams, we now just have one final team selection to make.   It has been an incredible process where fans remembered their favourites and recalled great games of the past. Remember all the stats and indeed some footage remain on line for the overall selection process, which will commence shortly.   Online, voting has really taken off with the team of the Noughties, yet the team of the Nineties continued to see the postal votes come in.   Interesting to note that the team was predominantly made up of players from the 1992/’93 double All-Ireland success.   Young Irelands trio DJ Carey, Pat O’Neill and Charlie Carter all make the cut, as do the dynamic defensive duo from Glenmore, brothers Eddie and Willie O’Connor.   There are also players who didn't figure in that double success and who took until the Noughties to win their first All-Ireland medals - like Peter Barry and Brian McEvoy from James Stephens. Also Henry Shefflin made the cut at full forward, having lined out there in 1999. The King endured defeat in his first decider, but he was to savour success a record ten times in the next two decades.   This was the first team where there was no overlap from the previous decade, and probably the only team if the votes go as you would expect - with Shefflin likely to feature on the next two teams.

Kansas is fortunate to have the talented, highly trained Lee Norman leading the Kansas Department of Health and Environment during a public health crisis.
   
 When Gov. Laura Kelly met with the editorial board in the weeks prior to the general election in 2018, she impressed on board members that her commitment to hiring qualified people to run state agencies made her worthy of election to the state's highest office.
   
 Kelly stressed the importance of needing highly competent agency secretaries, not political appointees, and vowed she would leave politics out of the selection process.
   
 After leadership failures by many of former Gov. Sam Brownback's appointees, there was no question the state needed competent leadership in every agency. She's delivered on her promise in many ways, but Lee Norman has proved exceptionally capable.
   
 His life's work has essentially prepared him for this moment. Norman served in the U.S. Air Force as a family physician, flight surgeon and combat medicine instructor and later a family physician in Seattle. In addition to his training and education to become a physician, he has an executive MBA and a master's degree in health planning and systems analysis.
   
 Norman also has extensive military training that is undoubtedly helpful as the state adapts its response to the pandemic. He's a colonel in the Kansas Army National Guard and guides medical troop sustainment and training, health services support, force health protection, biosecurity and serves as adviser and liaison to the Kansas Department of Emergency Management and Homeland Security.
   
 It's hard to imagine a person better suited for the job during a global pandemic.
   
 We've come to rely on Norman for his frank advice and stern admonishments when Kansans aren't heeding best practices. Take for instance his tweet on July 21: "Time for some plain talk. Schools can't be 'safe islands' in an unsafe community. Counties and cities who don't use the proven measures to reduce spread of Covid-19 ask schools and hospitals to fix their sloppiness and mistakes, which is wrong to do. The virus will find a way in."
   
 Since March, Secretary Norman and the folks at KDHE and the Department of Emergency Management have worked tirelessly to deploy resources, educate the public and scale up testing (in an outdated state lab). It's been a thankless job but one that deserves heaps of gratitude and recognition.
   
 If you're looking for more information about COVID-19 or you're feeling uncertain about what information you can trust, check out what Norman has to say. Thank you, Secretary Norman, for the commitment of you and your team to keep Kansans safe and healthy.

Jean Rykaczewski, the executive director of the West Alabama Food Bank, saw a problem coming as she watched the news back in February about the looming coronavirus pandemic.
   
 As a result of her planning and purchasing food in advance, the food bank has remained well supplied even after dramatically increasing the number of people the food bank was serving.
   
 Her primary problem came in the form of getting the food to the people who needed it.
   
 "For a while there, it was difficult. Normally, we have 97 agencies that help distribute the food. Many of those agencies are run by churches or other organizations, and some of those people who help are volunteers that are elderly," Rykaczewski said.
   
 "They shut down, so when they shut down, we opened up in our parking lot so people could get food. That was back at the time when the grocery stores were running out of food, people were scared, they were unsure, we had shut down everything. People who had never experienced food insecurity all of a sudden, they didn't have paychecks coming in. They didn't know what was going to happen, so there was a panic there," she said.
   
 Even food that she ordered had delivery problems when the trucking industry was affected by the virus. Getting food into the warehouse was difficult, and distributing it through her network of remote sites was also a problem. The food bank's temporary direct distribution helped deal with that immediate issue.
   
 "We were seeing about five or six hundred cars a day. We could only maintain that for a little while. Normally, we don't do that. We are a warehouse that distributes food out to remote sites, and so when that happened, our staff didn't get to our normal work until after 12 o'clock, so we got behind in what we needed to do," Rykaczewski said.
   
 Another problem brought on by the pandemic was that the food bank could no longer use volunteers as it had in the past. Under normal circumstances, volunteers supplement the food bank's 13-person staff liberally, but only a limited number have been used this year.
   
 Rykaczewski said they reasoned that the volunteers who had been with them since the beginning of the January had been around them so much that the worry of infections was minimized, but no new volunteers could be brought in, shifting that workload onto the staff.
   
 "It just became a very overwhelming task to try to handle. At the same time, we doubled the number of our senior boxes. We now have over 1,500 seniors who are getting the monthly box. That will go up to 2,000 by October," Rykaczewski said.
   
 Not many new volunteers are being utilized even now, and those new workers are kept in carefully controlled areas to help prevent the spread of COVID-19.
   
 "We have to have volunteers to pack our senior boxes. You are packing 2,000 boxes, so you need help. To keep them distanced, to keep them safe, to keep them masked and gloved, what we used to pack in a day is taking us a week to pack because we are bringing in small groups to do each task. Stuff we normally had volunteers do, we are not bringing in volunteers now," Rykaczewski said.
   
 She said the food bank is in a good spot right now, because they have been able to bring in more food than ever before due to generous donors, both private and corporate. But there are concerns moving forward. She said she is not overly worried about a food shortage; however, some of their big food drives have not happened because of the virus.
   
 "Some of our concerns are where we get food. 'Stamp Out Hunger' didn't happen this year. 'Beat Auburn Beat Hunger,' we don't know what that is going to look like," she said.
   
 'Stamp Out Hunger' is a summer event in which postal carriers collect donations of canned goods. During ' Beat Auburn Beat Hunger,' the University of Alabama and Auburn University compete to see who can raise the most monetary and food donations for their local food banks in the weeks leading up to the Iron Bowl.
   
 "Those are two areas where we get a lot of food and a lot of monetary donations, and those might not happen. How that's going to affect us in the future, we don't know," Rykaczewski said.
   
 One of the best ways to contribute to the food bank is to donate money, which can be done at www.westalabamafoodbank.org. Rykaczewski said that monetary donations allow the food bank to fill specific gaps in their supply.
   
 Since children have been out of school for an extended period of time, the food bank purchased foods that would specifically help families feed children who would normally have eaten breakfast and lunch at school.
   
 The food bank has distributed items such as cereal, macaroni and cheese, spaghetti and spaghetti sauce and peanut butter and jelly to help parents meet their children's needs. Rykaczewski said another great way to help is to donate excess produce from private gardens, so they can get fresh vegetables and fruits to their clients.
   
 Because of the COVID pandemic's effect on the food banks distribution sites, there could be occasional shut downs at remote sites throughout the year. When one of the volunteers becomes sick or tests positive for the disease, a distribution site may close down for a time. Rykaczewski said she expects that and will roll with the punches to do all that can be done to get food to the people who need it.
   
 "Oh Lord, this year I could have done without," she said.

When complete, the LTAB consists of five members; four — Smith, Kathy Ochs, Jim Maniaci and Gina Mackey — were elected in 2018. Herm Walker was appointed by Clark County District A Commissioner Michael Naft following the resignation of Kathleen Whitehead last year.
 This November, all five seats are up for election. The terms of the current members expire in January. Smith is not listed on the November ballot, according to the Clark County Elections Department. Ten candidates are, including Mackey, Maniaci, Ochs and Walker. Also on the ballot, according to the Clark County Elections Department, will be Stephanie Bethards, Fred Dotin, Vincent Henry, Kathleen Hoss, Lynette Taravella and Pam Walker.
 At time of his election, Smith said “he was a little nervous” going into his first year on the board. In his introduction to the board and the public, he saved information about himself and instead told the public he was there to serve them.
 “It’s not about you knowing me, it’s about me knowing you,” Smith said. “If you want to know more about me, come up to me either before or after the meeting. I am very approachable.”
 He said he really wanted to hit home that everyone should come up to the podium in the town hall to speak, whether it is good or bad. “We can take your criticism,” Smith said.
