Often traveller’s need more than one vaccine so planning is recommended."
 She added that there are certain basic precautions travelers need to undertake and there are added precautions now in light of COVID-19.
 "Traveller’s may need to undertake the COVID-19 test prior to travel depending on the requirements of the travel destination. Therefore, they need to correctly time this test so that it is valid at the time of travel. They should also follow all the necessary precautionary measures such as wearing a mask, maintaining social distance and frequently hand washing or sanitising their hands."
 In addition, travellers should have first-aid kit on hand at all times and carry routine medications like painkillers and antihistamines.
 Dr. Fatima Al Marzooqi, Family Medicine Physician at the DHA’s Primary Healthcare Sector said, "Most food and water borne illnesses arise from contamination during food preparation or from contaminated water sources. Practicing safe eating and drinking habits are essential in minimising the risk of contracting food and waterborne diseases while travelling."
 Al Marzooqi also advised purchasing travel insurance to help cover the costs of health emergencies. She said the clinic also provides prophylaxis medication such as anti-malaria tablets to traveller’s if they are going to a country where there is a high-prevalence of the disease.
 Al Marzooqi added that the DHA PHC’s are recognised as yellow fever immunisation providers in Dubai. As per the global health regulation rules, only government centers are authorised to issue the international vaccine certification.

“Most classes come in back-to-back,” she said. “Every once in a while, there is a little bit of a gap. I have to make sure that I have enough time to do that and that I have something for the kids to do because another class is usually coming in right after that.”
 Michel said she often has to determine what equipment she can use for her small group activities.
 “In the past, it was always the same flow to a lesson — what we started with, what is in the middle and what we end with,” she said. “This year, we might have to mix that up a little bit so that the equipment has enough time to dry in between or I have enough time to clean it. All the kids still get the same lessons and the same education; it is just the way we go about it where we have to get a little bit more inventive this year.”

DUBAI, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News / WAM - 20th Dec, 2020) The Dubai Health Authority, DHA, is encouraging those who plan to travel to ensure they take necessary pre-travel vaccinations at least one month prior to their journey to ensure the effectiveness of the vaccines.
 The pre-travel health services are available across all DHA Primary Healthcare Centre and the services include pre-travel counseling, risk assessment, vaccinations and medications.
 Dr. Alia Mohammad Al Dallal, consultant Family Physician and Acting Director of Specialised Programme Services Department at DHA’s Primary Health Care Sector said, "In terms of the COVID-19 vaccine, people who intend to travel should first seek their healthcare provider’s advice so that they can assess their medical condition, allergies if any, pre-existing health conditions and accordingly seek advice with regard to the vaccine."
 In addition to this vaccine, there are certain mandatory vaccines if you are travelling to certain countries, said Dr Al Hammadi.
 "There are mandatory vaccines such as yellow fever vaccine for African and South American countries. Yellow fever presents the greatest health risk for visitors to South America and Central Africa. When patients visit us, we discuss the places they intend to travel, length of stay, their health, current prescriptions and vaccine history. After a detailed consultation, we recommend vaccines as well as educate them about other travel precautions based on their destination.
 Dr. Al Dallal added, "Since vaccination requirements vary by country and some require second doses, it is important to visit a travel clinic at least one month prior to travel.

The two acts, the commissioners stressed, will prohibit unfair conditions imposed by online platforms and are at the core of the Commission’s ambition “to make this Europe's Digital Decade.” In particular, according to Vestager, “The two proposals serve one purpose: to make sure that we, as users, have access to a wide choice of safe products and services online. And that businesses operating in Europe can freely and fairly compete online just as they do offline.” Reaction to the announcement has been mixed, with Tiemo Wölken, S&D negotiator on the DSA report in Parliament’s Legal Affairs Committee, saying, “The DSA will give Europe a real digital constitution. Clear rules will ensure legal certainty for platforms and safeguard the fundamental rights of users. However, the proposal falls behind on some points.” The Greens/EFA Group, however, believe the plans “fall short of expectations”, with Dutch deputy Kim van Sparrentak, a member of the IMCO Committee, slamming the Commission that it “has failed to limit the market supremacy of the tech monopolies.“

NAVI MUMBAINavi Mumbai police have upped their vigil on the farmhouses in Panvel and its peripheries for the New Year celebrations. Many celebrities from Mumbai own farmhouses in this part of the city and come to celebrate New Year here.The Navi Mumbai police commissioner has warned people not to bring narcotics, firearms or any banned substance to the farmhouses, otherwise strict action will be taken.The farmhouses in Panvel had hit the headlines during Diwali in 2012 when four real estate agents were murdered at Patil farmhouse at Shiewale village by one of their colleagues. They had come to discuss some property-related issues at that farmhouse, and four of them were found murdered.Shivraj Patil, deputy commissioner of police (zone 2) said, "Taking past incidents into consideration, we will ensure heavy bandobast around the farmhouses during the New Year celebrations. No one will be allowed to carry firearms to the farmhouses. Our officials will be stationed in those areas from the evening of December 31 till the next morning."Separate teams will be formed for patrolling and they will also conduct surprise visits in the farmhouses. If we find anyone violating the norms, he or she will be arrested on the spot."According to Patil, there are around 200 farmhouses in that region that are scattered in the jurisdictions of Panvel, Panvel Taluka, Taloja and Uran police station."We have also instructed the senior inspectors of these four police stations to call the owners or the managers of the farmhouses and explain the norms in detail. They are now in the process of doing it. Earlier this week, we also appealed through local media to the farmhouse owners not to violate the Covid-19 norms," he said.Bipin Kumar Singh, police commissioner of Navi Mumbai, said, "We have no issues if people from other places come and celebrate at the farmhouses. But they should not violate norms. As far as the other rules of New Year celebrations are concerned, we will follow the guidelines issued by the state."

Workers on Sunday began packaging shipments of the second COVID-19 vaccine authorized in the U.S., a desperately needed boost to efforts to bring the coronavirus pandemic under control.
 Employees at a factory in the Memphis area were boxing up the vaccine developed by Moderna Inc. and the National Institutes of Health. The much- needed shots are expected to be given starting Monday, just three days after the Food and Drug Administration authorized their emergency rollout.
 Later Sunday, an expert committee will debate who should be next in line for early doses of the Moderna vaccine and a similar one from Pfizer Inc. and Germany’s BioNTech. Pfizer’s shots were first shipped out a week ago and started being used  the next day, kicking off the nation’s biggest vaccination drive.
