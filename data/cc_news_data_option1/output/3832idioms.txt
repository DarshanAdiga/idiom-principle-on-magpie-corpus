DIA‚Äôs major airlines have made clear in the past that they aren‚Äôt on board with the renovation plans, taking aim at the revamped security checkpoints, project costs and overall investment soundness.

 However, airport officials will report specifically on the changes to the Great Hall project in front of the City Council‚Äôs Business, Arts, Workforce and Aviation Services Committee on Oct. 7, when they are likely to be met with tough questions.

Several class actions have been launched in Canada over pandemic exclusions in business interruption policies, and a U.K. ruling in a test case of policy wordings determined that some carriers, and consequently their reinsurers, could conceivably be on the hook for pandemic-related BI claims based on policy wordings. Add to that a series of hurricanes causing significant damage in the southern United States recently, and reinsurers will likely be looking for more premium from their primary carrier clients, Baker predicted.

A jury convicted him of driving while ability impaired, false reporting of information to police, and driving under the influence per se ‚Äî a charge for those whose BAC exceeds .08%. Leppek‚Äôs sentence was four years in prison.
 At trial, Leppek‚Äôs attorney objected to an instruction that Denver District Judge Michael J. Vallejos gave the jury, indicating ‚Äújudicial notice‚Äù of the breathalyzer‚Äôs functionality. Judicial notice is applicable to matters that are well-known within the court‚Äôs jurisdiction or not subject to a reasonable dispute.
 ‚ÄúThere has been evidence introduced before you that an analysis of the defendant‚Äôs breath was made by means of an Intoxilyzer 9000 to determine the amount of alcohol in the defendant‚Äôs breath at the time of the alleged offense or within a reasonable time thereafter,‚Äù Vallejos told the jury.
 He continued: ‚ÄúThe court takes judicial notice that such testing device is a scientifically and legally reliable and accurate device for determining the alcoholic content of the breath. You may or may not accept this fact as true. You may weigh it as you would any other evidence.‚Äù
 Colorado‚Äôs DUI statute authorizes a court to take judicial notice of drug- testing methods and devices ‚Äúas certified by the department of public health and environment.‚Äù
