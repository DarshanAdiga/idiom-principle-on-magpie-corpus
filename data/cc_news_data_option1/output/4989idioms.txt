ROWLEY – Behind bars since his arrest 67 days ago, a Georgetown man accused of rape and other felonies asked a Newburyport District Court judge Friday to release him while awaiting trial – a request the judge promptly denied.
 The suspect, David G. Nadeau, 31, of West Main Street, was arrested by Rowley police Sept. 29 and charged with rape with threat of bodily injury, aggravated rape while committing a felony, kidnapping, assault and battery with a dangerous weapon (two counts), domestic assault and battery, intimidating a witness, threatening to commit a crime and possession of an electric stun gun.
 Days later, District Court Judge Peter Doyle ruled that Nadeau posed too great a danger to the alleged victim to be afforded bail while awaiting trial. The ruling came after a 30-minute dangerousness hearing during which Nadeau's attorney, Christopher Norris, asked Doyle not to send his client to the Middleton House of Corrections because of an outbreak of COVID-19 cases at the facility.

Perhaps even more importantly, our research has found that in 2019, almost two-thirds of the British public (65 per cent) believe it is important anti- LGBT+ language and abuse should be challenged at live sporting events. In 2018, this figure sat at just over half of Brits (58 per cent). This steady rise in people wanting to help LGBT+ people feel included in sport highlights how attitudes are shifting, both on and off the pitch - and Rainbow Laces is a crucial part of driving this change.
 Every year, the popularity of Rainbow Laces grows, and we see sports from horse racing to judo and clubs of all levels wanting to take part. It goes far beyond the elite level games - thousands of grassroots clubs have had Rainbow Laces community matches, and continue to do so.

This is a chaotic and overwhelming time for educators who need more support than ever. So, the exciting project I’m working on is figuring out how to provide the right tools and resources so that they can teach at their best. One way we’re doing this right now is through TpT School Access, a subscription service for schools and districts, so that teachers can get access to the instructional resources they need without paying out of pocket. As a former administrator myself, I’m constantly thinking about how we can unlock funds and provide more support for teachers, while saving their most precious resource: time. I’m proud to be able to work on projects like this that help teachers not only survive, but also thrive, even in today’s difficult circumstances.

It's been around 25 years since the last Bronco rode off into the sunset, and it's not entirely clear why Ford kept the nameplate on ice for so long. Yes, the model's reputation is obviously juiced with some unusual baggage, but that was hardly the automaker's fault. Either way, it can't have been easy to stomach watching Jeep average well over 200,000 profit-rich Wrangler sales every year for the last half decade. No matter, the 2021 Ford Bronco is here now -- or, more precisely, it's here for reservations now. Initial deliveries are promised next spring.

Reputation is everything and always. I’m not dodging your question, but I realize the typical answer is Web pages, advertising, LinkedIn, etc., all for sure important aspects of any business. But, for me, I never relied on them in the beginning. Word of mouth, work ethics, taking a client even for no pay, if it moves you forward, has led to my success, something I never take for granted. I firmly believe it can go as fast as it came. Respectfully, I’d like to answer the following, because I think it will be more helpful to someone getting started. I believe we can get bogged down with social media and putting everything out there. Timing is everything. Yes, it’s very important for our clients in the process, but for the publicist herself or himself you need a proven reputation, and including it with your personal life, in my opinion, is a mistake. Building a reputation that will enable you to move your clients forward is not a quick or easy journey, but a solid base for growth.

Twenty-year-old Afsana’s baby is due in a month. Afsana conceived just 10 days after the nationwide lockdown was imposed to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus. Afsana and her family of nine live a hand to mouth existence and the pandemic has only worsened their woes. The expectant mother is anaemic, having survived along with her family on just chapatis and red chilli paste on most days.
 Afsana’s husband, brother-in-law and father-in-law, the three breadwinners of the family, work at the local stone quarries in Derwala village in Jhunjhunu district of Rajasthan, where they live. They had no work for nearly three months, from April to June. Though work has picked up slowly since then, their daily earnings are as low as ₹150 on a good day. They survive on the wheat supply from the public distribution system. “Only if we go out in the day to work can we buy pulses, sugar and milk for our evenings. There is barely enough to last us a day,” says Mohammad Rafiq Bhati, Afsana’s brother-in-law.

 I'm here to tell you, Ford has absolutely nailed the look of this new truck. In both two-door and four-door forms, the 2021 Bronco has the sort of stance, proportion and detailing that not only give this SUV the necessary aura of utility, but lend the vehicle massive presence.

He said from his view, since he sees them violating the same ordinances, he feels as though they are getting just a slap on the wrist.
 “You got to give them a ticket; they’re getting away with it,” Page said. “I get a ticket for running a stop sign - I gotta go to court or pay the fine.”
 During the agenda item, Cardona addressed Page’s concerns.
 “Our code compliance staff makes every effort to achieve compliance through voluntary means,” Cardona said. “Enforcement is the last resort — only when all efforts for voluntary compliance have been exhausted.”
 Prior to finishing his statement, Page emphasized his displeasure with the conduct of his neighbors.
 “They should know the code of ordinances,” Page said. “I go online; I know the rules.”
 From Jan. 1 through Oct. 1, code compliance officers either fielded or observed through patrol 3,436 violations by residents. Of those, 20 citations were issued.
 “An overwhelming majority of those incidents are able to be addressed through voluntary compliance,” Cardona said. “And that’s one of the reasons why you see the low number of citations.”
 During citizen comments, Page said the city can generate revenue if it issued citations on a more frequent basis.
 Cardona said the purpose of code compliance is simply that. The purpose is not to be a money-making department of the city.
 From violation to enforcement can involve notification, inspection, re- notification, re-inspection and finally a citation. The time from notification to inspection varies based on the violation, but it can be 10, 14 or 30 days.

For me it was a Red Carpet moment. First of all, I love the “pace” of my work, so I feel comfortable on the Red Carpet. Red Carpets are fast-paced and you have to navigate your client towards the right interviews and be ready for the next. It’s a difference if your client isn’t well known in the media world as some of your clients. In this case, you have to maneuver the carpet and be alert as it moves fast. That’s why it’s important to have the respect of the media. Being aggressive is a must but always be respectful. It’s a fine line. With more notable, seasoned clients, it’s important to remember to stay back and let the media have their time. I have the trust of my clients and know when to gently move them down the carpet. Again, it’s about you being the calming factor for your client. One of my most humbling moments, was working a red carpet in LA. I was approached by a representative for a major US actor who noticed me on the carpet. I was asked if I would return to the start after I was finished with my client and walk their actor down, followed by the actor himself approaching me. Of course, I acknowledged the compliment, but, declined and returned full attention to my client. The US actor came up to me at an after-party and said that he was impressed by my loyalty. Brief as it was, it reminded me why I love my work and even though it is never about you, people are watching.

I think it's probably too early to say, right, from a clinical standpoint, but the exposure right now that we have in the CAPELLA trial, right, with the high treatment experienced patients. So I think we have to wait to see if that in vitro translates into the clinical, will just -- I think time will tell, but having said that, I think the reality is that the data from the CAPELLA trial, with those 36 patients were pretty impressive, and we're pretty excited about those data.

It's a relatively small proportion of HIV infected patients, but it's a really important population who are running out of treatment options, and the fact that the capsid is a new modality as therapy, right, a new mechanism of action, and the fact that we've seen what we have seen with the CAPELLA trial that you know about, we're pretty excited that that's going to provide an option for those patients, and potentially a potential early filing for us in that HTE population as sort of along the path to that, and then broader indication that we were talking about earlier about the PrEP or the long-acting approach.

I don’t even tell people about the first book!
