“Unfortunately, we have lost too many lives to this pandemic. Everyone has to do their part,” Infante said. “We can’t wait. There are thousands of people dying every day because we can’t control this pandemic.”


  And Infante wasn’t thinking about just herself when she decided to take the vaccine, which is given in two doses, 21 days apart.


  “I need to keep patients safe, myself safe and my family safe,” Infante said, adding her follow up appointment is already scheduled for Jan. 8. “And this is another tool in the toolbox to defend against this (virus).”


  For Monadnock Community Hospital CEO Cyndee McGuire, the first doses of the vaccine finally being distributed to employees is the realization of something that seemed so far away when the pandemic began in March.


  “It’s very exciting,” McGuire said. “It’s a historic day, for sure.”


  The doses MCH received on Wednesday afternoon, delivered by a N.H. State Police trooper, were among the 12,675 received by the state Dec. 14.


  “There was a formula used by the state to determine our allocation,” McGuire said.


  Employees in the first distribution included emergency department nurses, respiratory clinic staff — “people that are right in front of our patients,” McGuire said.


  According to McGuire, the hospital had identified 230 employees who met the criteria for Phase 1A distribution for front line clinical staff who provide direct patient care. Others is Phase 1A include first responders and residents of long-term care facilities. McGuire said that a list was sent to state officials last month as they attempted to determine how the first round of the vaccine would be distributed. Phase 1A employees were then categorized into high, moderate and low risk.


  “The process we went through was very calculated and prescribed by the state,” said Laura Gingras, vice president of philanthropy and community relations at MCH.


  Previously, McGuire had said she wasn’t expecting MCH to receive enough doses to vaccinate all 200-plus staff members in the first allotment.


  “We knew we weren’t going to be able to do everyone on day one,” she said. “But we anticipate being able to get to all our 1A employees, across all risk categories, by the end of January.”


  With only 65 doses available through the initial shipment of the Pfizer- BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, hospital officials used a “randomized process” to identify who would be among the group to receive the first round of the vaccine.


  “We used our ethics committee to determine a fair and ethical way to distribute the vaccine,” McGuire said. Adding that it was spread among many hospital departments and not just one specified area. She said it was done that way in an effort to cross departments and levels of staff, and since there are potential side effects, vaccinating one single department could leave the hospital short-handed in one area.


  As the director of the emergency department, Infante comes in contact with a lot of people and she knows getting the vaccine is the right choice.


  “I didn’t go into health care thinking I wouldn’t be challenged,” she said. “I want to help people and that’s been my mindset all along. This is what’s right for my patients.”

Bloomberg) -- The $27 billion cash infusion for U.S. transit agencies that Congress included in year-end legislation will help avoid draconian service cuts but still leaves them facing sharp declines in ridership and gas-tax revenue for years to come, according to advocates.


  The measures provides $14 billion in transportation-related aid in the nearly $900 billion Covid-19 relief bill, and $13 billion in annual appropriations in the $1.4 trillion government funding measure that were both adopted on Monday.


  “It buys us some more time,” said Paul P. Skoutelas, president and chief executive officer of the American Public Transportation Association, which lobbies for transit agencies. “It doesn’t solve the problem by any means.”


  Skoutelas said ridership on American transit systems has dropped 60% this year from pre-pandemic levels. He estimated that it could take several years before ridership returns to anything remotely close to normal levels, despite promising developments with Covid-19 vaccine deployment.


  That comes after major agencies like the New York Metropolitan Transit Authority warned of service cutbacks that would have reduced service levels by as much as 50%. The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, which serves the nation’s capital and the Virginia and Maryland suburbs, threatened to close 19 train stations and cut weekend rail service altogether.


  Former U.S. House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Chairman Bill Shuster, a Republican who represented a Pennsylvania district, said it would be about three or four years before riderships fully rebound, especially with the increase of the number of people working from home.


  “I think it’s a temporary fix for transit systems to get through 2021 and part of 2022,” he said of the appropriations adopted this week.


  Shuster said systems would likely have to consider increasing the use of automation to make ends meet long-term, which he acknowledged would likely rankle labor unions.


  “The biggest expense is personnel,” he said. “If any system can be automated, it’s rail. We know exactly where it’s going. It’s not going to be automatic, so it’s not going be massive layoffs. It’s something they’ll seriously have to look at.”


  A spokesperson for the U.S. Federal Transit Administration said the agency would review the legislation “to ensure provisions related to public transportation are implemented quickly and in accordance with federal law.”


  Skoutelas said the infusion of stimulus money “is good news, but it’s less half of what the calculated need was.” He added that the $13 billion in annual appropriation for transit systems was previously set aside by the 2015 transportation bill that was extended by Congress earlier this year. That money comes in part from the 20% of federal gas tax receipts that are earmarked for the mass transit account in the U.S. Department of Transportation’s highway trust fund.


  “No one’s got a crystal ball here, but my sense is it’s probably going to take a couple of years before we’re getting back to anything close to normal,” he said. “The industry done an incredible job demonstrating its commitment to cleanliness, and obviously there’s vaccines, but at the end of the day it’s really going to be about getting this economy moving again.”


  Former U.S. Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater, who served in the Clinton administration, said it was significant that Congress included funding for transit systems, even as funding for state and local governments fell victim to squabbling between Democratic and Republican lawmakers.


  The fact that the measure was passed on a bipartisan basis as a source of optimism for future transportation funding, he said. “They do so because they recognize these services are essential to moving essential workers,” he said.


  Congress will have another opportunity to provide a shot in the arm for transit agencies with the reauthorization of transportation funding set to expire in October 2021.

What has changed is the quality of the Eagles’ roster. Their 4-9-1 record is the worst the team has compiled since Fipp got here. The Eagles tried to get younger, to go more with rookies this year, and once a cascade of injuries began, they got even younger still, as veteran special teams standouts had to step up on offense or defense. That doesn’t explain why fourth-year kicker Elliott is having his worst season (13-for-18 on field goals, 1-for-3 from 20 to 29 yards), but it does explain a lot.


  Second-year linebacker T.J. Edwards led the Eagles with 25 special teams snaps at Arizona. Ex-special teams leader Alex Singleton, now a starting linebacker who played all but two defensive snaps Sunday, only logged 13 special teams snaps. Ditto safety Epps, who played every defensive snap. A rookie linebacker named Joe Bachie played 14 special teams snaps for the Eagles, in his second NFL game since the Eagles signed him from the Saints’ practice squad.


  “These guys are battling their tails off,” head coach Doug Pederson said Monday. “They’re doing whatever they can to do their job. We’ve got to dial in, and focus in, and make sure that we’re coaching and doing the right things there, as well, and get all our players that are new to the roster up to speed.”


  Fipp kept directing the questions away from his players, back to his own performance.

Letting one comment speak for many on snow removal


  I read in the Morning Times that the borough emergency manager was bragging about how well the borough has done in this huge snow storm. If anybody has been out driving, they know that is just not the case. The roads that belong to the state are plowed and you can see pavement. Borough streets are an absolute disaster. They are awful. Try to see some pavement there. Corners are all blind. Coming around corners, they’re not rounded in any way. When you’re turning right and there’s somebody on the other street, you have to wait for them to move in order to get around the corner. The roads in Sayre are a mess — even the ones that are listed as snow emergency routes — are an absolute mess. Shame on the borough.


  Chicken or the egg?


  I’ve been following the Athens controversy of which is more welcome — the chicken or the egg. I’m currently snowed in at home two days after the blizzard and thinking how easily this could become a true survival situation. If my neighbors raised chickens and would sell me a few eggs, that would be very good news. Think about it.

  Arizona blocked a first-quarter punt and scored two plays later. Punter Cam Johnston then had to leave the game with a concussion, affecting field position the rest of the way, with kicker Jake Elliott making his NFL punting debut. Since Johnston is the holder, the Eagles then had to go for it on fourth down in situations where they might have tried field goals, in a 33-26 loss. And they flubbed an extra-point attempt when backup holder Zach Ertz couldn’t field Rick Lovato’s low snap.

  Adding to the embarrassment was a 26-yard pass by Cardinals punter Andy Lee on fourth-and-2 from the Arizona 33, which didn’t end up costing the Eagles points because their defense stopped a subsequent fourth-down effort.


  Fipp said given the distance, he had his return group guarding against a run, not a pass. The blocked punt was just bad execution, he said.

Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton asked Trump administration officials to rescind federal virus relief funding that Houston used to expand people’s voting options, according to a document revealed Tuesday.
 In a May 21 letter to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Paxton accused officials in Harris County, which includes Houston, of misusing up to $12 million of the federal funding and violating state law with their plans to expand the use of mail-in ballots for the presidential election.
 “We respectfully ask the department to scrutinize its award of CARES Act funding to Harris County in light of the county’s stated intent to use federal funding in violation of state law, and to the extent possible, seek return of any amounts improperly spent on efforts to promote illegal mail-in voting,” Paxton wrote. “Without implementing adequate protections against unlawful abuse of mail-in ballots, the department could be cast in a position of involuntarily facilitating election fraud.”
 The Washington-based Citizens For Responsibility and Ethics obtained and published the letter, in what has become the latest example of the Republican attorney general’s efforts to keep in place Texas’ strict rules requiring most voters to cast ballots in-person, even during a pandemic.

I think we went through a really tough period, with all the injuries we had. Obviously we’ve still got a pretty big list of injuries now.

 # 19-year-old found shot to death in car, JPD says
 Gabriela Szymanowska
 Mississippi Clarion Ledger
 View Comments
 A 19-year-old was found dead in a vehicle in an IHOP parking lot in Jackson following a shooting Tuesday, according to authorities.
 Jackson Public Information Officer Sam Brown said Tuesday afternoon that police were on the scene at the IHOP at 474 Briarwood Drive.
 Brown said that the incident started near N. State Street and Culley Drive where gunshots were heard. The vehicle then traveled to Briarwood Drive. The shots were believed to be from a second, unknown vehicle, according to a tweet by Jackson police.
 The victim has not yet been identified. He was found in the front passenger seat of a car. There is no information on a suspect or motive.
 The capital city has now had 125 homicides in 2020. The total number includes 124 investigated by the city's police department and one investigated by the Hinds County Sheriff's Office. One death in a child abuse case was also ruled a homicide by the Hinds County Coroner's Office.
 Jackson has seen a sharp increase in violence in 2020 compared to recent years, which police attribute largely to personal conflicts and the ongoing pandemic. According to FBI data, the previous record for homicides in one year was 92, set in 1995.

U.S. District Judge Leonard P.

It was pushing, it was a counter movement, ball had been thrown. I was trying to get the hand off me, his left hand was coming my way. And off a reaction, I went to go push cross. But, the fist was clenched. I watched it, no less than 100 times, the replay. And anytime you have a balled fist, you're putting yourself in danger. So, it made contact with his facemask, the refs did what they thought was necessary, whatever the process was. But, by not being on the field, I hurt the team. So, that's on me.

In summer 2007, after Purdue Pharma agreed to pay $600 million to resolve a federal investigation of potential opioid-marketing misconduct, the Sackler family members at the helm of the drug giant deliberated whether it was time to leave the pharmaceutical business.


  "I think we need to discuss if fundamentally we want to be in the pharmaceutical business going forward. I would vote no," wrote David Sackler, who was not in the company at the time of the June email to his father, Richard, and cousin Mortimer, both on the company's board. The email chain was about the possible buyout of a smaller company. "I think we've all had enough of a rough ride over the past 10 years to make me wary of committing for another venture in the space," he wrote.


  Copies of the emails, along with memos and messages from a family WhatsApp group chat, were unsealed last week in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in the Southern District of New York, where the company and its affiliates filed for relief in September 2019. The documents offer the most complete picture yet of the internal deliberations of the wealthy family that led one of the largest manufacturers of prescription painkillers during the height of the opioid crisis.


  After the Justice Department settlement, the Sacklers met with a bankruptcy attorney, assessed selling the company to a larger firm and were advised to take "defensive measures," including through "overseas assets with limited transparency and jurisdictional shielding from U.S. judgments," according to the documents.


  "Fundamentally, we don't want to stay in this business anymore (given the horrible risks, outlooks, difficulties, etc) and I think the majority of your family feels the same way," Mortimer wrote to Richard eight months after David's message. "Even though our prospects have improved dramatically I feel it offers us a unique opportunity to sell at a very high price and once and for all eliminate the great risks we have and continue to take and secure our families' current and future financial security."


  While this was happening, Purdue's staff continued to market and sell its blockbuster opioid OxyContin.

Bloomberg) -- The Bank of Thailand will likely keep its benchmark interest rate unchanged at a record low while monitoring the recent rally in the baht and letting fiscal policy take the lead in driving an economic recovery.


  Sixteen of 17 economists surveyed by Bloomberg expect the Bank of Thailand to keep its key rate at 0.5% on Wednesday for a fifth consecutive meeting, after lowering it by a total of 75 basis points earlier this year. One expects a 25-basis point cut.


  The central bank’s focus has shifted to the currency, which has rallied more than 9% from this year’s low in April and is the second-best performer in Asia this quarter. The rally is threatening efforts to boost exports to offset the slump in tourism revenue, prompting the central bank to issue measures to boost outflows given the limited space remaining to cut rates.


  “We expect BOT to keep rates on hold through end-2021, despite a muted economic recovery for Thailand,” said Tim Leelahaphan, an economist at Standard Chartered Bank Plc in Bangkok. “We do not see the BOT using policy rates to rein in persistent baht strength, at least for now.”


  Here’s what to watch for in Wednesday’s decision:


  Currency Complications


  The government wants the central bank to restrain the baht, which has surged on foreign inflows into local stocks and bonds. Last week the baht hit its strongest level against the dollar in a year after the country was included on the U.S. Treasury’s currency monitoring list.


  The Bank of Thailand said Dec. 17 it has conducted two-way intervention in the market only to smooth out volatility in the currency, and has no intention of using the exchange rate to gain an unfair advantage over trading partners.


  After Thailand’s inclusion on the currency-monitoring list, “the central bank might prefer to scale back on direct intervention, instead opting for non- traditional measures like the package announced last month,” said Radhika Rao, an economist at DBS Group Holdings Ltd. in Singapore, referring to eased rules on capital outflows. “We expect the BOT to express discomfort on the currency strength, particularly the disconnect with underlying fundamentals, but not go beyond verbal intervention for the time being.”


  GDP Outlook


  The central bank will likely revise its economic forecasts for this year and next to factor in last quarter’s better-than-expected performance and a fresh Covid-19 outbreak over the weekend.


  The National Economic and Social Development Council last month predicted the economy would contract 6% this year, compared to the 7.8% contraction the central bank predicted in September. The council has forecast 3.5%-4.5% expansion for next year, with the central bank expecting 3.6% growth.


  Governor Sethaput Suthiwart-Narueput indicated earlier this month that the economy may beat the current forecast for this year, but could underperform next year if tourism remains weak.


  Virus Outbreak


  After months of keeping infection rates low, Thailand has been struggling with a fresh outbreak of Covid-19 in recent days. If a wide lockdown is reimposed, that would hurt economic growth.


  “We think the new outbreak is currently dampening sentiment. Its impact on the economy is being assessed,” Standard Chartered’s Tim said. “We think the Bank of Thailand, at least for now, may want to preserve limited policy space to manage further downside risks to the economy.”


  DBS’ Rao said the outbreak likely wouldn’t affect the outcome of Wednesday’s meeting.


  “While the outbreak might be acknowledged by the central bank, we don’t expect any emergency policy easing,” she said. “Even prior to this resurgence, policy makers had emphasized the need for fiscal support to be stepped up to support demand and get the economy back on the recovery track. These calls might get reiterated as headroom for easing narrows.”

None of us really know what goes on when the changing room door is closed so little hints like this are fascinating. All didn’t appear well earlier in the season when Farke gave two of his star players, Emi Buendia and Todd Cantwell, a public dressing down for their attitude.


  Norwich fans could have been forgiven for thinking that it was the beginning of the end for either those two players or the head coach. That’s how these things tend to resolve themselves.


  Yet that Cardiff game on Saturday showed how well Farke has handled a tricky situation. It’s not just that Buendia and Cantwell scored the goals but their performances were sensational. If they are still at Norwich and performing like that at the end of the next transfer window City will be well on course for a Premier League return

  "Stuart came back at half-time as white as a sheet to say that it was bad. It was a serious injury, possibly an ACL and might need an operation. We all met in Nottinghamshire the following week, there was a club away day with Stuart and Daniel where we had an afternoon meeting and then some dinner in the evening.


  "At that time, we didn't know what the Maddison prognosis was going to be. It was slightly better that day but it wasn't definite that he wouldn't have to have an operation. If he did, then that would have been it for that transfer window. Even if there was no operation, he was out for the whole pre-season and this would be a very hard deal to do.

SILVER SPRING, Md. (AP) -- A closely-watched gauge of U.S. consumer confidence tumbled in December as rising coronavirus cases dragged American optimism to its lowest level since the summer. However, rising pessimism is now spreading during the crucial holiday season, which could make or break a number of retailers, airlines, restaurants other sector that have been hammered financially during the pandemic. The December reading of 88.6 released Tuesday by the Conference Board is a sharp decline from last month, which was revised downward to 92.9, and it is far worse than economists had expected. It may be an ominous sign for an economy in which consumer spending accounts for 70% of all economic economic activity.

A fixture for passing motorists for years, the bull at the Peerless Restaurant was temporarily removed from its spot on North Roan Street on Monday.
 Gary Kalogeros, the Chief Managing Partner of Peerless Properties & Development, said the company plans to restore the statue and reinstall it as the renovation of the restaurant nears completion.
 According to a press release from the company, the bull has never been taken down in the history of the Peerless. It has, however, been updated and moved several times over the years.
 The bull was once located on the restaurant's rooftop in the 1950s, and it was then moved to its current location on North Roan Street in the 1960s.
 "It’s a true icon for Johnson City residents and the many celebrities who dined in the restaurant over the decades of its long history," the restaurant said in the release.
 Over the years, the restaurant said, many people have ridden the bull for photo ops. As the Peerless bull was being removed, the press release said people slowed on North Roan Street and honked their horns as they passed. Several passersby pulled into the parking lot to see the statue removed.
 The company hopes to resume construction on the restaurant after the first quarter of 2021, which hinges on the progress of the new vaccine and success in efforts to stop the spread of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19).
 Officials with the restaurant announced in January plans to redevelop the eatery and adjacent retail space, resulting in a new bakery, a tavern and new retail businesses at the site on 2531 N Roan St.
 Kalogeros told the Press in January that the redevelopment provides an opportunity to combine his family’s development and restaurant businesses that are now entering a fourth generation with his eldest son, Demetri Kalogeros, serving as part of their management.
 Once complete, the company said Peerless Properties & Development will have several new retail spaces available for lease in the Peerless Town Center plus additions to current buildings.
 Also, the former Real to Reel Theatre space will be getting an update to its exterior. Peerless Properties & Development has been in talks with several entertainment venues and has reached out to several specialty grocery markets about the space, but no deal has been struck at this time.
 The company expects renovations to building exteriors will start in late spring of 2021.

There was some positive financial information shared with the public during last week’s Calvert commissioners meeting; however, in light of the negative impact COVID-19 is having on citizens and the local business community, the board received the news with a grain of salt.


  In early February, county government will finalize numbers for it’s recommended budget for fiscal 2022, which begins July 1, 2021.


  Tim Hayden, finance and budget director, reported on Dec. 15 that Calvert ended fiscal 2020 “with an unaudited surplus of $10 million.”


  The commissioners had reduced the county’s property tax rate from $0.937 per $100 of assessed value to $0.932 per $100. The current plan is to reduce the rate even more in fiscal 2022 to $0.927 per $100.


  “Revenue is off to a strong start,” Hayden said of the initial months of fiscal 2021, which runs from July 1 of this year to June 30, 2021.


  As for income tax, a revenue stream that provides 30% of the general fund’s composition, Hayden reported the county has seen its “first positive variance since [fiscal] 2012.”


  Hayden reported that for the past seven years actual income tax numbers “have come in lower than projected.” He added that for income tax receipts, fiscal 2021 “is off to a gangbusters start.”


  According to the current estimated income tax revenue, that line item could top $100 million in the county’s next operating budget.


  “At some point it’s going to catch up with us,” Commissioner President Earl “Buddy” Hance (R) predicted. Hance noted that many state and federal initiatives would soon be ending.


  “We know firsthand that businesses are struggling and people are unemployed,” said Hance. “So far the federal government has artificially pumped up the economy. At some point that’s going to stop and those businesses are going to struggle to come back to where they were. There will be a gap. That extra money is not going to keep coming.”


  “I’m trying to get a real picture,” said Commissioner Mike Hart (R), who noted that in fiscal 2023 the county’s annual revenue “will drop $9 million from the Dominion project.” The latter decrease is per the payment-in-lieu-of- taxes agreement Calvert has with the owners and operators of the liquefied natural gas plant at Cove Point.


  Commissioner Thomas “Tim” Hutchins (R) pointed out that the higher than projected income tax revenues could be the result of having the federal and state income tax filing deadlines pushed back three months due to the coronavirus. The income tax projections are based on money taxpayers earned in calendar year 2019 before the crisis began.


  “I’m not saying we should prepare for rain, but there’s a possibility of a storm cloud,” Hart warned. “I just don’t want us to fall off a cliff next year.”


  “We are doing well in the pandemic,” Hayden stated. “If COVID[-19] shuts our world down things could change.”


  Beth Richmond, finance and budget deputy director, pointed out that Calvert retained its AAA bond rating with three agencies due to its increases in fund balances and fiscal conservancy.


  “By keeping tax rates low and a conservative budget approach, it gives us the flexibility to weather any storm,” Richmond said.


  The county government’s biggest single expenditure — public education — could see budgetary angst during the fiscal 2022 planning cycle. As pointed out during the presentation, there is no funding formula for the Calvert County Board of Education in place for that year.


  Hayden stated county officials are predicting a “very significant decline” in student enrollment for fiscal 2022, which he added is a trend “throughout the country.”


  Edith Hutchins, Calvert public schools’ chief financial officer, stated that due to the system’s “modified plan” that has been in place since March due to the coronavirus, “some expenditures are lower than normal.” She added that “salaries and benefits are still being paid.”


  “Funding the contracts and paying for the benefits is my priority,” said Edith Hutchins. She estimated “at least $195 million will be needed” in fiscal 2022. She added that she and school system officials across Maryland are hoping the state is able to provide its share of funding and hold the counties “harmless” from any budget cuts.


  “I think it’s going to take a lot of cooperation on both boards’ parts,” said Commissioner Steven R. Weems (R), who indicated a joint meeting of the commissioners and board of education appears in the works during the budget process.


  Richmond stated the staff’s proposed budget, which is tentatively scheduled for a public hearing in late March, will not include new positions or new initiatives, and neither salary steps nor a cost of living adjustment will be made for Calvert County employees.


  Hayden said, “There’s lots of time between now and June,” when the fiscal 2022 budget is finalized.

I mean, I think it’s kind of strong to call it a revolutionary act itself. I think it’s definitely important and significant, and I also think it’s beneficial. But to call it revolutionary to report on the acts themselves is a bit strong, because at the end of the day I am press. I am protected in a certain way that protesters aren’t. Even if the police don’t know me, a lot of the other reporters around know who I am. So I have a certain level of privilege in those spaces. I think that doing my job as a reporter isn’t necessarily a revolutionary act. I’m reporting on revolutionary acts and people that are putting their bodies on the line, and in doing that I’m putting my body on the line yeah, but I wouldn’t say what I’m doing is any more revolutionary than a reporter that’s being sent to report on the war in Iraq. It might be something that’s definitely dangerous and brave of them, but not necessarily revolutionary. But it has special importance, definitely, because it does require vulnerability. I end up injecting a lot of my voice and my personal stories into some of the reporting I do, because I can’t act like my life isn’t intertwined with this in a lot of ways. And I think a mistake a lot of journalists make is believing that people think robots are writing these stories. When you try to take all personality away from a story, you’re trying to convince readers that they’re not reading a story by a real individual. I’m trying to make sure that while I’m not centering myself in the story, I’m trying to make sure people know that a real person is writing it.

Neil's refusal to work with a sporting director saw Balls lead a recruitment charge for David McNally's replacement after his shock resignation earlier that season. Moxey's experience at Wolves saw him headhunted as the man to succeed McNally, an appointment that the ex-chair admits was wrong.


  Moxey's relationship with the majority shareholders, supporters and board became strained and he left Carrow Road just six months after his appointment.


  Results on the pitch still weren't of the standard supporters expected. Despite relegation from Premier League, Balls reveals why the club decided to support Neil rather than opt for a new direction.


  "If it was Watford, he would have been sacked," Balls told the Along Come Norwich Podcast. "The supporters backed him, Delia and Michael strongly supported him and the board backed him. He was a young manager, he'd taken us up and nobody felt that he was done.


  "Alex had to manage, without David, all the player relationships which often become contractual. The things that are now split between Stuart and Daniel (Farke) were largely all falling to Alex. I and Steve Stone tried to bring in people to support him. It was a very tough time. In which it would have been difficult to bring somebody in who would have been his new footballing boss.


  "Instead, what we considered doing was bringing in somebody from the outside to do a piece of work for us over a month to look at how the football side was run but Alex didn't want to do that either.

While Ocasio-Cortez has also argued that the left could use its leverage in the Speaker vote in more effective ways, pretty much all of the attempts at using that leverage have not worked so far. The progressives didn’t put up an alternative when they had a chance to during the caucus vote, so the only alternative to Pelosi is QAnon-friendly Republican Kevin McCarthy. Progressives including Ocasio-Cortez were locked out of the most powerful congressional committees again; Ocasio-Cortez was allegedly snubbed from the Energy and Commerce Committee because of her Pelosi criticism, but multiple reports have made it clear that she was also punished for supporting primary challenges to other Democrats, including Republican-endorsing Rep. Henry Cuellar. (Alex Sammons’ recent _American Prospect_ report on the obscure steering committee vote that led to Ocasio-Cortez’s exclusion is required reading for anyone who wants to understand how the Democratic center wields power to try to force the left to fall in line; to her credit, Ocasio-Cortez has doubled down.)

It’s not a 1:1 comparison, of course. While you’ll see a case for Medicare for All in the op-ed pages of national papers every once in a while, the media has shown its hostility to Medicare for All is much more vicious than what Republicans screeching about death panels and killing grandma were dealing with in 2009.

Redhouse Arts Center has made the difficult decision to pause its Theater Operations for the foreseeable future.

His inaugural season was cut short due to the Global Pandemic with the final two shows of that season, Fences and Fun Home, being cancelled. Theatre's across the country have mostly remained dark due to the ongoing crisis. The economic toll of COVID-19 has, unfortunately, caused many arts organizations to make these difficult decisions.

MADISON, Wis. — One of two Wisconsin counties that conducted recounts of their presidential votes spent nearly $730,000 on the effort.


  Dane County Clerk Scott McDonell released numbers that show the recount cost $729,733. About a third of that — $243,000 — went to pay tabulators. Another $104,000 of it covered police protection.


  The county, which includes the state capital, Madison, estimated that the total cost would be $740,800.


  President Donald Trump's campaign paid $3 million in advance for recounts in Dane and Milwaukee counties, the state's two most Democratic counties. Trump lost Wisconsin to Democrat Joe Biden by 0.6 points. Under state law, losing candidates can request recounts but must pay the cost upfront if they lose by more than 0.25 percentage points.


  The recounts resulted in a slightly wider lead for Biden. The counties are required to calculate actual costs and are supposed to be reimbursed from Trump's payment. If costs come in below estimates, excess funds are supposed to go back to Trump's campaign.


  Milwaukee County has yet to disclose its final costs. County Clerk George Christensen didn’t immediately respond to a Tuesday email.


  The Legislature's Republican-led finance committee has refused to release any money for the counties after its co-chairs, Sen. Alberta Darling and Rep. Mark Born, announced Dec. 11 that an unnamed committee member had objected to any transfer. Darling and Born said in a letter to Gov. Tony Evers' administration that the committee would meet to discuss the reimbursement but didn't say when.

Questo accordo è il risultato di un lungo lavoro e di una collaborazione molto stretta. Con il nuovo accordo si realizza l'aggiornamento e la categorizzazione dei reati base su cui si richiede l'estradizione”, ha dichiarato Gjonaj. “L'accordo funge da segnale chiaro e deciso a tutti i trasgressori della legge che nessuno troverà alcun rifugio per eludere l’azione penale negli Stati Uniti o in Albania. L'atto che formalizziamo oggi attraverso questa firma, è un di chiaro segno della ferma volontà del governo albanese, in termini di rafforzamento dello stato di diritto e della sicurezza ma la prova del sostegno incrollabile del nostro amico e alleato, gli Stati Uniti d'America, nella realizzazione di questo obiettivo comune”, ha concluso il ministro.

"Yeah, I think the defense played well, but clearly not well enough to where we won. If we, we eliminate some of those touchdowns and make them field goals, we're in a better position to win. I think that there should have been another sack fumble between me and David Onyemata. But that was looked over. At the end of the day, we don't have time for excuses or time to whine. We have the Vikings coming in. This is something that we have to take advantage of."

I think our job is to just tell the truth. It sounds really basic, but at the same time it’s really confusing for a lot of journalists clearly. Because we often rely on that trope of objectivity, and in the traditional sense what that will tell you is that if I am a reporter, I take what the police put out in their press conferences and that’s what I’m putting in my story. And we have evidence over time that shows that police are not entirely trustworthy in that way. You can’t just take their word for it a lot of the time. We have proof of this over and over again, and CPD especially is a major culprit of that. So when I get a statement from the police, I can’t just take that and run with it and treat it as law, because a lot of the time they like to create their own narrative. As a reporter you have to be on the ground looking at everything from a 360 degree way. You have to be looking at the lines of the police officers as much as you are the lines of protesters. You have to be scrutinizing and analyzing the actions of not just the protesters, but also the police. In doing that, you get a better sense of not just what each of the sides’ actions are, but also their relationship to one another. So, what do the police even feel like they’re out there to do? Are they out there to arrest people? Are they out there to protect protestors who are using their first amendment rights? Or are they here to protect these businesses? Are they here to kettle and abuse people? And I’m not necessarily saying they are out there to do these things, but when those things happen we have to be able to look and say “yes, the police attacked a person.” And even if the police come out tomorrow and give all these numbers about officers injured on the job, you still have to tell that story about the person that the police attacked. Because at the end of the day these are civilians. Just like the police have a responsibility to serve, you as a journalist have a responsibility to serve.

Dropped in the first week of April, _Toosie Slide_ captured the emotions many felt as the reality of COVID's impact on the world became apparent. Named after social influencer Toosie's steps, the song was uniquely downbeat and reflective for a song with dance steps, and it was this element, combined with Drake's appraisal of his insecurities, that helped make the track relatable. With many entering self-isolation for the first time, and the future unknown, it was reassuring to know of one certainty "basically, I'm saying either way, we 'bout to slide, ayy/ Can't let this one slide, ayy."

CINCINNATI (FOX19) - One man is making it his mission to rally the community to help business owners during the pandemic.Nick Tino, President of GT Industrial Supply, launched the Save Cincy Restaurants website to make it easier for the community to donate to restaurants that have been hit hard this past year.GT Industrial Supply was 10 years ago by Tino. The company services restaurant supplies to about 100 restaurants in the area.When COVID-19 hit, Tino says his company found that a lot of restaurants might not make it through the tough times.“Just over the last year, we’ve kind of seen the devastation that these restaurants have gone through, and I think it’s a lot worse than the public may be aware of,” Tino says. “We kind of ran some numbers here and 30 to 40% of our customers could potentially not make it to the summer.”To help out, he created and launched Save Cincy Restaurants.It’s a website where restaurant owners who need help can join and add a link to their GoFundMe page.“We were trying to think of ways we could help, and company- wise, we’ve eliminated some order fees and delivery fees and try to keep down our margin, and you know it’s really just not enough, it’s not a big enough effect,” Tino explains. “So, we were trying to think outside the box.”So far, 60 to 70 restaurants from around the I-275 loop are participating.Tino and GT Industrial Supply co-founder Michael Griffie say whatever it takes to help these business owners, they are all in.“Obviously, this time of year, I think everyone’s a little more generous, and I think that’s a great thing, and I think we’re in that same spirit, and we wanted to be able to do something,” says Griffie. “So, for us to be able to help out in any way we could, I think is a positive.”This website is something Tino and Griffie hope doesn’t fade away in a few weeks. They hope to push this for the next few months.Any restaurant wanting to join can do so by calling GT Industrial Supply at 513-771-7000.See a spelling or grammar error in our story?

La terza frazione si apre con una brutta notizia per Vitucci, perche Willis fa il suo quarto fallo ed e costretto a tornare in panchina. Il match, inoltre, si fa duro con molti contrasti al limite e Oostende ne approfitta riportandosi in parita, 54-54. Dopo il timeout brindisino, Harrison spara la tripla del +3 per il nuovo vantaggio Happy Casa. Il Filou sembra concedere di piu in difesa e i pugliesi la puniscono con Perkins e ancora un immarcabile Harrison. Nondimeno, i punti di Schwartz tengono a galla gli ospiti che, concludono il terzo quarto solamente sul -6, 66-60.

After their arrest, a judge ruled the couple had to provide 40 hours of community service and pay a $4,400 fine. In addition, Ramgeet was ordered to a two-month curfew that would start at 7 p.m. But the prosecution appealed, arguing the punishment was unduly lenient and would not deter other possible violators. A higher court decided in favor of prosecutors, ruling on Dec. 15 that the couple be imprisoned immediately.

For example, restaurants can tap into the PPP a second time at 3.5x monthly payroll. This compares with 2.5x for other industries. Eligibility puts a 300-employee cap per restaurant location, compared with a 300 allocation cap for other industries. Tax deductions include certain business expenses paid with PPP loans, such as payroll, rent, mortgage interest, utilities and other allowable expenses. This applies to either a first draw or a second draw PPP loan.

"We respectfully ask the department to scrutinize its award of CARES Act funding to Harris County in light of the county's stated intent to use federal funding in violation of state law, and to the extent possible, seek return of any amounts improperly spent on efforts to promote illegal mail-in voting," Paxton wrote. "Without implementing adequate protections against unlawful abuse of mail-in ballots, the department could be cast in a position of involuntarily facilitating election fraud."
