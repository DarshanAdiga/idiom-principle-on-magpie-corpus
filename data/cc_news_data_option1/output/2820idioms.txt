Mallette, who was just beginning his 14th year as the Paramount’s programming director, hit the ground running. The nonprofit theater just opened a series of drive-in movies in Rutland at the Vermont State Fairgrounds, accommodating 60 vehicles.
 “We are currently running films Friday and Saturday, although other nights are expected soon,” Mallette said. “The shows sell out in literally minutes. For us it’s an opportunity to give folks a chance to safely congregate. You get to be around people — but not really be around people.”
 And Mallette is making plans with Brandon to bring drive-in movies to the Estabrook Park parking lot there.
 “When we looked at who our ticket buyers were at the Rutland drive-in, we quickly learned we weren’t selling a lot of tickets north of Pittsford. So Brandon makes a logical next step,” Mallette said. “What most energizes me most about these is, we’re helping solve the problem of lack of work by creating activity.”
 That means paying the theater’s tech staff and much more.
 “We’re producing work again, therefore we’re generating income via sponsors, supporters and ticket sales,” Mallette said. “We’re also maintaining institutional visibility within the community. That to any organization is important, but we’ve said we were one of the first industries to close down, and we’ll be one of the last to reopen. So it’s very important that we retain visibility and remind the community that we’re here — we’re still doing work but it’s in a different shape.
 “If you told me six months ago that me and my team would be building two drive-in theaters, I’d say you I think you have the wrong Eric in mind,” Mallette said.
 In fact, Mallette isn’t quite sure what lies ahead for the Paramount, but it looks a lot like the old Paramount — eventually.
 “Let’s get 30,000 feet above what this is,” Mallette said. “I don’t see the other side of this in the long term, the far distant life of the Paramount. I don’t see it altering in dramatic ways. Our goal is to get back to what it is we were really doing — which is just producing live events in a small city in a small state.”
 People in the Rutland region have come to recognize the importance of the Paramount Theatre to the community.
 “We’ve never had to discuss what it would be like for Rutland to not have the Paramount. There’s never been that discussion in the last 20 years,” Mallette said. “We’ve been closed for nearly 120 days and, boy, it doesn’t feel very good.”

Gene Gennoe is torn.
   
 He knows the dangers of the coronavirus pandemic and knows how it has been ravaging the country.
   
 But he's also a football coach. He loves the game and has seen how it can help boys become men.
   
 He wants to get back on the field.
   
 "In the research I've seen, it doesn't seem like kids at this age are very vulnerable," the Jefferson coach said. "With teenagers, if they get it, there is a 99.8 percent chance that everything will be fine. At the same time, I don't want to diminish it."
   
 Gennoe and other coaches got some welcome news when the Michigan High School Athletic Association announced Friday morning that it will attempt to keep fall sports in the fall for 2020.
   
 Some had suggested switching sports that feature less contact and more social distancing such as baseball and softball to the fall because of the coronavirus pandemic.
   
 But the MHSAA plans to stay with its normal schedule of football, volleyball, cross country, girls swimming, girls golf, boys tennis and boys soccer in the fall.
   
 "I am very, very excited right now," said Erie Mason football coach Rob Beaudrie. "This is huge."
   
 "I think they are doing the right thing," Gennoe added. "The plan is to try to start things as normal and constantly evaluate."
   
 The MHSAA promised to track all the latest developments and medical information and proceed accordingly.
   
 "I think they put out a plan that has flexibility in it," said Whiteford athletic director and football coach Jason Mensing. "Everyone's goal and wish is to have football in the fall."
   
 Mensing said the new MHSAA plan balances the desire to return to sports with the realities of the current medical risks.
   
 "Everyone wants us to buy as much time as we can," he said. "Things have been changing so often since March. … The goal is that everyone will mask up and the numbers will go down."
   
 Football practice in Michigan is scheduled to begin Aug. 10.
   
 The coaches in all of the fall and spring sports needed some guidance.
   
 "We're about a month away at this point," Mensing said. "The spring to fall idea had some merits, but it also had some deficiencies. The last thing I want to do is see spring sports canceled again."
   
 More than 400 football coaches in Michigan tuned in for an online meeting with MHSAA executive director Mark Uyl last week.
   
 "Mark is the big backer we needed," Beaudrie said.
   
 "What I like is that the guys at the state level have put in a lot of time and effort to do the best they can to make sure we have all three sports," Gennoe added. "I like the fact that they are fighting to keep all the sports and I like the fact that they are flexible.
   
 "If it has to happen that they have to cancel some sports, at least we know they are doing the best they can."
   
 Here is the full MHSAA press release:
   
 Michigan High School Athletic Association member schools will begin the 2020-21 school year playing Fall sports as traditionally scheduled, but with contingency concepts for potential interruptions due to the spread of COVID-19.
   
 The MHSAA Representative Council, the Association's 19-member legislative body, met virtually with MHSAA staff Wednesday (July 15) to discuss a series of ideas for playing sports beginning in August. The Council will meet again July 29 for further discussion. Currently, high school football practices are scheduled to begin Aug. 10, with all other Fall sports to start practice Aug. 12.
   
 The MHSAA is moving forward with a plan that first calls for all Fall sports to be started and played as scheduled. However, if the situation deems it necessary, the start of some or all Fall sports practices or competitions could be delayed. The next step in the plan's progression calls for lower-risk Fall sports that can be played to be completed, with higher-risk Fall sports postponed until later in the school year. If all Fall sports must be suspended, they will be rescheduled during a reconfigured calendar that would see Winter sports begin in November followed by the conclusion of Fall and Spring seasons potentially extending into July 2021.
   
 Additionally, the Council considered a concept that would swap traditional Fall and Spring sports, but determined that was not a feasible plan. Football, girls volleyball, girls swimming & diving and boys soccer during the Fall are considered moderate or high-risk sports because they include athletes in close contact or are played indoors; they were considered the impetus for potentially switching all Fall sports to Spring. But traditional Spring sports - girls soccer and girls and boys lacrosse - carry similar risk, negating the value of making that full season switch. Moving only selected Spring sports, like all low-risk to Fall, was not considered sound because it would force student-athletes to pick between sports they've previously played.
   
 Plans remain reliant on progression by schools and regions across the state according to Governor Gretchen Whitmer's MI Safe Start Plan. Currently two regions are in Phase 5, which allow for limited indoor activity, while the rest are in Phase 4 and unable to host indoor training, practice or competition.
   
 "Our student-athletes just want to play, and we've gone far too long without them playing. But doing so safely, of course, remains the priority," MHSAA Executive Director Mark Uyl said. "Our plan moving forward is Fall in the Fall, starting on time. We're excited to continue moving forward to bring back sports safely. It's important for keeping students in our schools and keeping students in our sports programs.
   
 "We remain grateful to the Governor for the opportunity to build the schedule and policies for returning sports to schools. We will continue to support her directives and those of the state and local health departments as we work to create the safest environment for all involved in our activities."
   
 The MHSAA staff is building COVID-related policies for all Fall sports and will make those guidelines and precautions available to member schools as the season approaches. Those policies will follow up what was presented to schools for summer offseason training, which began June 1 across the state and has seen thousands of student-athletes participate.

The fascinating thing is the reason the Latinx community is far and away the most concerned about climate, it's associated with having more egalitarian world views and a stronger sense that your community, your friends, your family expect you to do something. Not just to know about it, but to be a part of the solution. It's really interesting when we think about the societal and cultural shifts that are going to be needed to address this problem. Solving the climate crisis is not just an engineering problem. It's a social norm problem as well. We have to shift what we expect and how we see the world.

Oh summer. How we love thee. With long sunny days, barbecues, beach and pool outings, and just a little R&R, how could this not be a favorite season to many?
 With all of the fun activities that summer brings, it could possibly cut into our fitness regimen. So, that is when we throw in a quick, powerful move to get the job done!
 Our move today is a plank rotation. All you need for this exercise is a yoga mat and a flat surface. This exercise will be focusing on core strength, but you will find it to be a total body exercise.
 Begin this combination move by laying flat on your stomach on your yoga mat. Find your positioning by supporting your upper body on both hands. Place them about shoulder width apart and lift up your upper body by extending them out straight. Tightening in the core and rotating your hips forward to get a deeper contraction, extend your legs straight out behind you and support your lower body on your toes.
 Now you will find yourself in a planking position. Once you find your stability, it is time to add in a rotation.
 Start by lifting one arm off the ground, twisting in the midsection and extending that arm up over your body to the sky. All the while, hold your body weight with your other arm and both feet. When you reach your fullest rotation, reverse the move, guiding it with your midsection and placing your hand back on the ground. Then begin the same rotation on your other arm.
 Continue this side to side core rotation for at least eight to 10 times on each side. Give yourself a small break in between sets by dropping to your knees and shaking your arms out. Then continue into a few more sets. If at any time you need to drop to your knees and continue your rotation, you will still be getting the benefits of the move with less tension on the body.
 This is a good starting point also for those with any kind of restrictions or who simply lack the strength to hold a plank for an extended period of time.
 This exercise will definitely boost your confidence in all of your summertime activities!

Another favorite of mine is pink mallow (Malva alcea). This is a big, often floppy perennial with lots of pink blossoms that resemble those of a hollyhock. In my garden, it pops up anywhere and everywhere. I have to treat it a bit like a weed to keep it in control. It does best in full sun and rich soil that stays lightly moist.
 Pink mallow has a tap root and does not transplant easily, unless you do so when small. I often stake mine to keep them upright — it can grow to be 2-5-feet tall. Not often seen in garden centers, get a seedling from a fellow gardener, and let it go to seed so you’ll get more plants.
 Another flower that moves around the garden, appearing by whim, is feverfew (Tanacetum parthenium). Feverfew has white daisy-like flowers with a yellow center, each blossom just three-quarters of an inch across, but appearing in vast numbers. It is a short-lived perennial that sows seeds freely, so if you don’t want more plants, cut off the flowers before the seeds are dropped.
 Feverfew will grow in average soil, but prefers moist, rich soil. It’s blooming for me now, and will continue for the rest of the summer, or nearly. The flowers do well in a vase.
 My beebalm (Monarda didyma) is just coming into full bloom now, and is deliciously fragrant. It is in the mint family, with a square stem that is relatively fragile. But they make great cutflowers, in part, because of their fragrance. Bees love them (hence the name), but hummingbirds do, too. Mine grow to 5-feet tall.
 Many books claim beebalm is a full sun plant, but I disagree. It does best in morning sun or partial shade in rich, moist soil. It goes by quickly in hot, dry areas. The best blossom colors are red and purple, though cultivars in white and bluish are sold. Recently, short varieties have appeared in the marketplace, but I have not found they are very hardy. Beebalm spreads by root, but pulls easily if it gets too rambunctious.

Dil Bechara (2020) title track.
 At least two let-go-and-have-fun songs share the same DNA as Rahman’s _Matargashti_ ( _Tamasha_ , 2015). There’s _Khulke Jeene Ka_ , in which Bhattacharya writes about throwing caution to the wind, and singing “filmon ki gaane” while play-acting as “heroine hero”. It’s a lovely song, and the production never comes in the way. Though it is primarily Arijit Singh’s track, he doesn’t get to hog it. Shashaa Tirupathi feels like an equal participant.
 The other is _Mashkari_ , which is a more pronounced attempt at being fun. But it’s a bit too restrained and doesn’t have the madness of _Matargashti_. The deliberate and studied sense of abandon and good cheer in each tune never really allow the soundtrack to reach for the stars.
  _Khulke Jeene Ka_ sounds like it’s going to be the most successful at being the sort of happy tunes Rahman-Bhattacharya have tried to deliver, but a key change near the end suggests something amiss with the song’s universe. Something like that snaps the listener out of the song.

An arbitrator on Friday awarded over Rs 4,800 crore to Deccan Chronicles Holding Ltd in its dispute against the Board of Control for Cricket in India over the termination of the company’s Indian Premier League franchise team, a DCHL lawyer said.
 The arbitrator held the termination of franchise as illegal, the lawyer added.
 After the BCCI conceptualised IPL T20 tournament in 2008, DCHL was declared successful bidder for franchise Deccan Chargers from Hyderabad, and an agreement was signed between Deccan Chargers and the BCCI for ten years.
 But on 11 August 2012, the BCCI issued a show-cause notice for termination of the franchise to DCHL and the termination was confirmed a day before the expiry of the 30-day period granted to respond to the notice, the lawyer said.
 DCHL then approached the Bombay High Court claiming that the termination was arbitrary. The HC in September 2012 appointed retired Supreme Court Justice CK Thakker as the sole Arbitrator to decide the matter.
 “The sole arbitrator on Friday upheld the termination to be illegal and granted damages to the tune of Rs 630 crores and compensation to DCHL to the tune of Rs 4160 crores.
 “DCHL has also been granted Rs 36 crore as an admitted amount payable under the Franchise Agreement,” said Maneesha Dhir, Managing Partner of Dhir & Dhir Associates, who appeared for DCHL.
 BCCI can challenge the arbitrators order before the Bombay High Court.
