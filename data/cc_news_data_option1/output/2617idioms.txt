While she did not end up attending the Mount Rushmore event, CNN reported that Guilfoyle was in attendance for Trump's Tulsa, Oklahoma rally in late June. She also attended a subsequent event for Trump in Phoenix, Arizona. In addition to those two campaign events, Guilfoyle and Trump Jr. have been in the upper Plains region hosting fundraisers in the past several days. One of those events, which was billed as the "Mountain West Ranch Retreat," occurred in Gallatin Gateway, Montana from Tuesday until Thursday. Another event, billed as the "Rapid City Roundup Retreat," lasted from Thursday to Friday. Guilfoyle was reportedly with "a lot of campaign donors" in the past week, according to a CNN source close to the situation. It should also be noted that Guilfoyle was not seen wearing a mask at these events.
 Guilfoyle is not the only member of Trump's team to test positive for the coronavirus. As CNN noted, one of the president's personal valets tested positive for the illness back in May. Eight members of Trump's advance team staffers also tested positive for the coronavirus following their attendance at the president's rally in Tulsa. In light of that news, all of the Trump campaign staffers who were at the Tulsa rally quarantined last week after interacting with several colleagues who later tested positive for the contagious illness.

La segnalazione – pervenuta alla Centrale Operativa della Questura intorno alle 16.00 – è giunta da parte di una donna che, poco prima, si era imbattuta nella scippatrice. Quest’ultima, con destrezza, si era avvicinata alla malcapitata e, appoggiando il braccio sinistro, avvolto in un lenzuolo, sul corpo della vittima prescelta, era riuscita ad infilare la mano destra all’interno della sua borsa, celando lo scaltro gesto con il pezzo di stoffa. Accortasi, però, che il portafoglio rubato non conteneva contanti, la ladra lo aveva gettato a terra e si era data alla fuga.
