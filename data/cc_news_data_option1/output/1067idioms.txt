For example, sodium bicarbonate is an anti-caking agent used in table salts, dried milk, sugar products, egg mixes, and flours. In Europe, potassium ferrocyanide and sodium ferrocyanide are common anti-caking agents for table salts. Anti-caking agents are categorized into natural and man-made. Natural anti-caking agents such as calcium carbonate and magnesium carbonate are exponentially expensive than man-made ones, and hence are sparingly used. Due to a thriving food and beverage industry and various other factors, the global market for anti-caking agents is expected to expand at a healthy CAGR during the forecast period of 2014 to 2020.

The president, in an appearance in the White House briefing room, when asked when the pandemic would subside, said that “if we do a really good job” the crisis could pass by July or August, a far less optimistic take than in his earlier predictions that it could be over within weeks.


  “We will rally together as one nation and we will defeat the virus,” Trump said. “We can turn the corner and turn it quickly.”


  The administration did not immediately define what an “an older American” was in terms of the recommendation to stay home.


  The U.S. government moved Monday to try to blunt the impact of an expected surge of coronavirus cases, racing to bolster testing and aid even as the financial markets fell and Americans scrambled to reorder their lives.


  In a capital resplendent in cherry blossoms but awash in anxiety, Congress convened to try to finish an aid package and consider another one behind it. The Supreme Court postponed oral arguments for the first time in over a century. Many people in the capital, as around the country, sought safe distance from each other.


  President Donald Trump and other leaders of the Group of Seven countries spoke in a video teleconference about coordinating their responses to the virus. This, after some European leaders were upset by Trump’s decision last week to impose a travel ban without consulting them.


  Trump has implored Americans not to hoard groceries and supplies, saying there is no need to do so, as the White House works to get diagnostic testing much more widely available after lagging on that front for weeks. It was not considering enacting or recommending a nation-wide curfew, nor enacting limits on domestic travel, according to a senior administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity to address spiraling rumors.


  The U.S. surgeon general said Monday that the United States is about where Italy was two weeks ago in the coronavirus struggle, a sign that infections are expected to rise.


  “We are at a critical inflection point in this country, people,” Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams told Fox News. “When you look at the projections, there’s every chance that we could be Italy.” Yet he said the U.S. has opportunities to mitigate the pandemic.


  Two weeks ago, Italy had 1,700 cases of coronavirus and had reported 34 deaths. Now, Italy is reporting an estimated 25,000 cases and more than 1,800 deaths. About 3,800 cases have been reported in the United States and so far, more than 65 people have died from coronavirus. Although the numbers may not be directly comparable, the trajectory is, as Adams sees it.


  The administration also alleged that a foreign disinformation campaign was underway aimed at spreading fear among Americans already spooked by the pandemic.


  On Sunday, federal officials began confronting what they said was a deliberate effort by a foreign entity to make Americans think the government was going to impose a nationwide quarantine. Agencies took coordinated action Sunday evening to assure Americans that the government was not planning to do that.


  And on Monday, national security officials said there had been a cyber attack involving the computer networks of Health and Human Services, but the networks were operating normally. They didn’t detail the nature or scope of the problem or identify the foreign entity.


  On Fox News, Adams claimed the U.S. has “turned the tide” on testing, a critical part of tracking and containing pandemics, but whether that is true remains to be seen.


  The U.S. effort has been hobbled by a series of missteps, including flaws with the testing kits first distributed by the federal government and bureaucratic hurdles that held up testing by private laboratories. But Trump, who has been sharply criticized for underplaying the severity of the crisis, stuck to his relentlessly optimistic tone about the nation’s response.


  “Everybody is so well unified and working so hard,” he tweeted. “It is a beautiful thing to see.”

And yet they might — they already are. There's a strain of argument being voiced in certain quarters — most famously from Rick Santelli, who has since apologized for suggesting we infect everybody and get it over with — that the whole world's approach to the virus is misguided. Rather than limit the virus's spread, we should effectively encourage it — at least among the young and healthy — and focus on isolating the most vulnerable. Once the disease has spread very widely, "herd immunity" will inhibit transmission and prevent future outbreaks. Meanwhile, we shouldn't shut down our economies, but focus on keeping them up and running as fully as possible. Some people may die, but lots of people die from car accidents, and we don't shut the roads — and lots of people will die from the costs of an economic contraction as well.

The mall wasn’t exactly hopping, but I saw only the odd mask. I didn’t notice anyone make an obvious effort to stand six feet away from anyone else. If social distancing was happening, it was too subtle for me.


  The sun was out. Rain had yet to fall. Life in the time of coronavirus, I thought, didn’t seem to have changed our habits so much.


  Still, as I stood just off to the side taking these scenes in, I felt an intense wave of loss and nostalgia. It was only later when I was at home on my own that I fully began to understand why.


  At first I thought I was mourning the enforced separation from each other that we were just about to start experiencing. Then I realized I was mourning a togetherness already on the way out – from a long ago age before Amazon, before Netflix, before Postmates. Before giant flat-screen home TVs with surround sound, before virtual reality.


  We are in the midst of a pandemic. People suddenly are falling sick. They are dying. We must practice social distancing now – for our own health, to protect the health of others and to fight to keep this coronavirus in check.


  But haven’t we been distancing ourselves from each other more and more for years? Isn’t being apart becoming more and more our norm?


  I’d started out thinking about how, in California, we’re used to crises making us come together, not come apart. In the rubble, in the ash, we’re used to crossing our own property lines and comfort zones and reaching out to anyone at all who needs help.


  But then I realized that part of what’s striking in the modern era of our earthquakes and fires and mudslides is the many times when neighbors who were strangers meet each other in extremes, when in calamity communities suddenly spring to life and coalesce.


  Because in the modern age, in ordinary circumstances, a lot of us increasingly keep to ourselves. After all, it’s become so very easy and convenient.


  Why go to a restaurant when you can have exactly what you would have ordered there delivered to you in the comfort of your home? Why go to a theater when you can watch a movie that’s practically just come out on TV?


  Why go see a friend when you can Facetime and text? Why go to the store and see people – except for pandemic panic shopping – when you have Amazon and Instacart? Why work in an office with others when you can do your job on your own in your pajamas?


  The day after I went out in search of crowds, the rain arrived here in Los Angeles – literally and figuratively.

Southern California grew gray and damp. Coronavirus closed in.


  Events that draw crowds started being canceled right and left. So did plenty of far cozier, more intimate gatherings. Concerts, conferences, festivals, tournaments, classes, church services, campaign rallies – all nixed, postponed or preparing to become online only.


  Everything changed in a flash, dictated by necessity. Social distance was no longer theoretical; isolation no longer optional.


  I’ve written before about my worries about a modern-day world in which more and more people are isolated and lonely, working at jobs without offices, going whole days without real human contact. Now we’re all in that boat.


  I’m hoping enforced separation will do the trick and slow down the community spread of coronavirus. I’m willing to do anything to help make that happen. I think we all have to be all in to do that.


  Still, many things I often chose to do immediately felt different and constricting when they were no longer by choice.


  All our modern conveniences – our screens and our apps, our online shopping, our delivery services – can provide us with so much coziness and ease when we’re feeling over-stimulated and worn out and need to retreat from the big world outside.


  But it’s one thing to work from home because you feel like it and you can. It’s another to be told that you cannot go spend the day with your co-workers in the office. It’s one thing to stream a movie by choice or to choose to watch a basketball game on TV. It’s another to be told that you should not go to a movie theater, that you can’t go to a basketball game; that concerts have been called off.


  It’s one thing to order in food because you want to put on your comfy clothes and curl up on the couch. It’s another thing to get a note from one of the delivery apps saying you can now request not to even see your delivery person but to have your order left at the front door.


  It’s one thing to know you can choose the big world anytime, when you’re tired of the couch and of texting.


  Right now, of course, just a few days in, I want nothing more than to go out to eat with friends, to hug a neighbor, to hold a hand.


  I’m hoping we get to the other side of this without large-scale tragedy. There’s no way of knowing yet if we will.


  But if we do, I’m hoping that the experience of social distancing gives us pause and makes us realize how much we have missed company, not just the company of those we know and love but of strangers.


  We live in a world that can be scary, a world where people fire into crowds, where stock markets crash, where the gap between the haves and the have-nots keeps growing, along with the anger and division. But I’m hoping that if we get through this, we don’t let fear take over, that we come together again in full appreciation of how good that can feel.


  Just the other day, I watched people mingling en masse. I hope I’ll get to do so again before long.

A West man agreed Monday to a three-year prison term Monday after breaking a man’s jaw in a fight during last year’s Westfest celebration.


  Thomas Gordan Brown, 38, pleaded guilty to aggravated assault Monday and asked 54th State District Judge Matt Johnson to postpone his formal sentencing so he can attend to his mother’s health issues. Johnson agreed to delay sentencing until April 15.


  Brown’s attorney, Phil Martinez, said statements he obtained from witnesses to the incident said a man who was obviously drunk groped Brown’s wife and kissed her. He also groped other women at Westfest and attempted to kiss another one, but she was able to push him away, witnesses said.


  After Brown, who also had been drinking, learned what the man had done, he slugged him in the face. The punch broke the man’s jaw, which required surgery to repair, records show.

OK, so technically he’d already been doing the job. And how had that been working out? Let’s review the tape. He traded away one of the top’s defensive stars, Jadeveon Clowney, to Seattle for a third-round pick and a couple of marginal players. He gave up a third-round pick for Duke Johnson, who was nothing more than serviceable. He added Carlos Hyde, Laremy Tunsil and Kenny Stills to the offense, and those guys all worked out to varying degrees, but the deal with Miami cost the Texans the hefty price of two first-round picks and a second-rounder.


  When you talk about bumbling failures, though, the Hopkins trade is O’Brien’s David. It’s his Mona Lisa. It’s his Venus de Milo.


  It’s a true masterpiece of moronity.


  That’s saying something too, considering O’Brien’s clock management as a head coach is the polar opposite of Swiss timekeeping.


  It just makes you wonder why. Why would O’Brien give up his best offensive player for a running back who, while talented, rushed for a whopping 345 yards in 2019? The narrative that surfaced in the aftermath of the surprising trade was that Hopkins was unhappy with his current contract, a five-year, $81-million deal he signed in 2017, and the Texans didn’t want to renegotiate the deal.


  OK, so? You could roll the dice that Hopkins would hopefully report to camp anyway. After all, he is still under contract, and that’d be the only way he’d keep getting paid. Or, even better, you try to communicate with your star player and iron out any hard feelings.


  The Texans – for all their limitations – featured one of the most dynamic passing combinations in the NFL in Hopkins and quarterback Deshaun Watson. Their skills were harmonious. Watson is supremely gifted at scrambling outside of the pocket and throwing on the run. Hopkins is uniquely adept at bouncing off defenders and making difficult catches in traffic. (He’s the James Harden of wide receivers, in that he almost seeks out the contact.) Why would you break that up?


  I know, I keep asking that question, without any real semblance of a reasonable answer.
