Having presented on his own for four years, Denise joined Johnny as they looked to recreate some of their old TV magic on the airwaves.
 But trouble was afoot when Denise walked out after six months and ended her contract early, citing other commitments in her heavy schedule.
 Nothing more was said at the time, but years later Denise revealed the actual reason why she left.
 She accused Johnny of 'sabotaging' her while on air, refusing to let her get a word in and never mentioning her name during the introduction of the show.
 "Johnny didn't really welcome me with open arms, in fact he made me feel very uncomfortable," she told the Daily Mail in December 2012.
 "He wouldn’t let me speak, would tell me when I should and shouldn’t speak and would also constantly not mention that we were joint presenters. It was always: 'This is Johnny Vaughan, you are listening to Capital Radio,' and there was no mention of my name.
 "I was on the other side of the desk. He had control of the desk and when I would go to speak he would fade my microphone down."

A boat carrying dozens of migrants was stranded at sea on Friday as hurricane-force winds and heavy rain battered the western coast of Greece, causing power outages and road closures. Coast guard officials said due to the high winds, rescue boats were so far unable to approach the vessel believed to be carrying more than 50 migrants south of Greece&rsquo;s Peloponnese region.A powerful tropical-like storm named Ianos battered the western islands of Zakynthos, Kefalonia, and Ithaki overnight, causing flash flooding, property damage, power outages, and road closures mostly from downed trees, police and local authorities said.No injuries were reported. The storm, with winds exceeding 70 miles per hour, reached the western mainland on Friday.Computer models suggested that the storm would not directly affect Athens but heavy rainfall was also expected in the Greek capital.Schools and stores were closed, and ferry services were suspended in many areas in western Greece as authorities advised residents to remain indoors.&ldquo;We are expecting the storm to progress with the same intensity for the six to nine hours in western Greece and then, weakened, see it head southward,&rdquo; Civil Protection chief Nikos Hardalias said.&ldquo;But areas that are not directly affected … will see a large volume of water with heavy rainfall.&rdquo;

 Channel 4's Black Takeover day will kick off with comedian Mo Gilligan hosting The Big Breakfast, which bosses say will feature its "original anarchic spirit, distinctive energy and unique sense of humour" and will be "reimagined through an unashamedly Black British lens".
 Denise came back for a second stint with Johnny in 2000, but too much had happened between them to go back to how they were before.
 "We were proper mates. I laughed every day, we used to laugh to the point where I was going to wet myself," she explained on Natalie Pinkham's In The Pink Podcast In November last year.
 "Then things happened and we’ve had fallouts along the way.
 "There’s are couple of reasons why... when the show became successful and we were negotiating contracts I thought we were doing it as a team but his agent had other ideas and she got him more money and there were all those arguments that happens with bands and presenters.
 "I wanted us to be a team and it became apparent we were not a team anymore and we never got back on track."

Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta admits he was unconvinced that Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang would sign a new contract when he first took charge at the Emirates Stadium. Aubameyang signed a new three-year deal last week to end months of speculation over his future, with his previous contract due to expire next summer.The 31-year-old has hit 72 goals in 111 appearances for the Gunners, including a brace in the 2-1 FA Cup final win over Chelsea last month.Now the Arsenal captain has committed to the club for another three years despite rumoured late interest from the likes of Barcelona.Arteta often had to bat away questions surrounding the status of contract talks with Aubameyang but became increasingly positive the Gabon striker would stay.However, ahead of Saturday&rsquo;s Premier League visit of West Ham, Arteta conceded he was not quite as sure of Aubameyang&rsquo;s future when he was appointed as Unai Emery&rsquo;s successor back in December.&ldquo;To be fair at the start when I joined, I wasn&rsquo;t as positive as I was in the last few weeks,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;Obviously, financially we were in a position that it was difficult to get where we wanted to get. I think Auba had his doubts as well at the time but things evolved in a natural way.&ldquo;I had the feeling that the club wanted to move forward, I had the feeling that Auba wanted to stay here and we were just trying to apply those things together and that sometimes takes time.&ldquo;But the outcome is what we both wanted so we are happy.&rdquo;While Aubameyang has stayed put, Arsenal sold goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez to Aston Villa on Wednesday.Martinez had enjoyed a fine end to last season as he replaced the injured Bernd Leno for the closing weeks of the campaign but was dropped in favour of the Germany international for last week&rsquo;s opening day win at Fulham.Villa paid a reported £20million for Martinez as Arteta said the sale could help fund new signings.&ldquo;We have to find some balance between what we want to achieve with the squad and our finances, and it gets to a point where you have to make a decision whether to achieve certain things you have to sacrifice others,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;But time will tell whether we are weaker or not. Obviously the recruitment we are planning to do to try to get our second goalkeeper hopefully will bring us a really good performance level.&rdquo;Arteta also suggested a change in expectations from Martinez, given he had finally made it into the Arsenal side having joined 10 years ago, led to a situation where neither he nor Leno would be happy to warm the bench.&ldquo;I was very clear with both of them that it wasn&rsquo;t a one and a two, they had to compete for their place like any other position in the team,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;To be fair, Bernd was superb before he got injured at Brighton and Emi was absolutely excellent with all the games he played and how much he helped us win the trophies.&ldquo;But at the end of the day that created a big competition, some big expectations from both of them and we had to deal with that.&ldquo;We were really open and trying to have those discussions, in the end Emi had a really good offer and it was very suited for what he wants to achieve long-term and short-term and we allowed him to leave the club.&rdquo;The PA news agency understands a deal to sign Dijon goalkeeper Runar Alex Runarsson is close, while Brentford&rsquo;s first- choice David Raya also continues to be linked with a move to the Emirates Stadium.

Up and down and up trading this weekThe EURUSD closed last week near 1.1845. The current price is trading at 1.18446. There has been a good amount of ups and downs but at the moment, the change for the week is as close as it can get without being unchanged. Nevertheless, in between the end of last week and now, the price action saw the pair move higher into the Tuesday high at 1.18999 (call it 1.1900). That was a nice natural level to lean against. There were not one, but two highs against that level on Tuesday (see hourly chart below). Keep that level in mind going forward. If it stalled the rise twice and at a key natural level this week, it will remain a key level going forward. The pair fell to the Thursday low at 1.17362. That move took the price to the lowest level since August 12 - taking out the September low in the process at 1.17518 and the August 21 low at 1.17533 (see daily chart below). However, the pair could not break the August low at 1.17103. The price moved back above the 1.1751-53 area, and the pair trended higher. The price moved above both the 200 and 100 hour MAs by the close yesterday tilting the bias more to the upside (blue and green lines on the hourly chart above). Today, the price tried to move higher but kept on returning to the 100 hour MA at 1.1813 currently. The price over the last few hours has moved back below the 100 hour MA but has found support buyers at the 200 hour MA at 1.18308. That has been the floor today and will remain a barometer for the buyers and sellers. Stay above (and if the price can also remain above the 100 hour MA all the better) and the buyers hold onto the control. Move below, and all bets are off as the bias tilts more to the downside. It's Friday. That can lead to choppy the price action especially as London traders head for the exits. Be aware. For now, the pair is waiting for the next shove, but at/near neutral levels.

De Stoop believes the global tanker market this year will have three good quarters followed by a bad Q4, highlighting how "spectacular" the April-June period was thanks to limits on land storage that created a frenzy to store crude at sea and pushed freight rates to record highs. VLCC WAF-East rates were languishing at one-year lows of $12.97/mt by the end of June, a fall of over 80% from early-April, according to Platts data, but a number of longer term deals have buoyed the tanker industry for longer.
