Stephen Kenny admits it will take a brilliant performance in Bratislava for the Republic of Ireland to safely negotiate their Euro 2020 play-off semi- final.
 Ireland, one of the host nations, face Slovakia in what is just Kenny’s third game at the helm on Thursday evening knowing their dreams of making it to the delayed finals tournament will be over if they do not come away with a victory.
 He knows that could be a big ask with the ink on his blueprint for lasting success still wet, but the prize which awaits is all the motivation he and his players need.
 Republic manager Stephen Kenny \- (Copyright PA Wire)
 Kenny said: “I think, in perspective, most neutrals if they are commenting on the game would see Slovakia with the home advantage and would see them as slight favourites.
 “We are going to have to really play at the top of our game to win. The motivation is very high – the players’ careers are short and the opportunities to get to the European Championships and major tournaments are not so frequent, so if you can achieve that, particularly when it’s in Ireland – which is unprecedented – would be incredibly special.
 “For the players themselves, they know they are going to have to really put in a brilliant performance to win.”

The Minnesota Wild made two deals with the San Jose Sharks and re-signed two key players on a busy Monday.
 In separate transactions, the Wild traded forward Ryan Donato for the Sharks' third-round pick in the 2021 NHL Draft and traded goaltender Devan Dubnyk for San Jose's fifth-round selection in 2022.
 Minnesota also re-signed defenseman Carson Soucy to a three-year, $8.25 million contract and forward Nico Sturm to a two-year, $1.45 million contract.
 Donato, 24, recorded career highs in goals (14), points (23) and games played (62) this past season. He did not notch a point in two games during Minnesota's qualifying-round loss versus Vancouver.
 Donato has collected 57 points (29 goals, 28 assists) in 130 career games with the Bruins and Wild since being selected by Boston in the second round of the 2014 NHL Draft.
 Dubnyk, 34, posted a 12-15-2 record with one shutout, a 3.35 goals-against average and career-worst .890 save percentage this past season.
 Dubnyk is 247-195-52 with 32 shutouts, a 2.58 GAA and a .915 save percentage in 11 seasons with the Edmonton Oilers, Nashville Predators, Arizona Coyotes and Wild. He was a first-round pick by the Oilers in 2004.
 Soucy, 26, tallied 14 points (seven goals, seven assists) in 55 games in his first full season with the Wild in 2019-20. He also set a franchise rookie record for plus/minus rating at plus-16.
 Sturm, 25, had two assists in six regular-season games this past season. Sturm recorded his first career NHL point with an assist at Arizona on Dec. 19.

 # Participation up for Democrats, down for Republicans after first day of early voting
 Doug Livingston
 Akron Beacon Journal
 Early voting figures in Summit County look less like 2016, when Republican participation surged, and more like 2018, when Democrats reclaimed the U.S. House of Representatives.
 The numbers also show that the county’s pandemic-prepared early voting center at 500 Grant St. processed more in-person ballots on the first day of early voting this year than that day in 2016.
 Early voting in Ohio began Monday. For weeks, Ohio’s 88 county election boards have been catching up on a record number of absentee ballot requests.
 The boards started sending those absentee ballots to voters Monday as a line of in-person voters began to form an hour before the doors opened to the public at Summit County’s early voting center, located next to the elections board.
 A total of 1,350 over-the-counter ballots were filled out and placed into sealed envelopes Monday. Election staff will open the envelopes and start feeding the ballots into machines when the polls close on Election Day, which is Nov. 3.
 Compared to 2016, the first-day turnout that includes over-the-counter ballots cast at the early voting center was up 42% in Summit County. By registered party affiliation, in-person absentee balloting fell 13% for Republicans while increasing 41% for Democrats and 80% for nonpartisan voters.
 Voters affiliate by party when they pull a partisan ballot in a primary. The 2016 presidential primary, with heavy competition on the Republican side, saw the ranks of the GOP swell in Summit County and Ohio. The opposite happened in 2018.
 It’s early with only one day of early voting in the bag and 27 yet to count. But based on the breakdown of who's requested an absentee ballot so far in Summit County, the tide appears to be favoring Democrats for a second consecutive federal election.
 As of the end of the day on Monday, 113,541 registered voters in Summit County had applied for an absentee ballot. That’s a 115% increase from the 52,929 voters who asked for an absentee ballot by the first day of early voting in 2016.
 Mail-in and early voting is dominating the 2020 election as many voters wary of spreading or contracting the coronavirus have opted to fill out their ballots and drop them in a secure drop box added this year at the Summit County Board of Elections.
 Democrats have nearly tripled their early voting activity, with 189% more absentee ballot applications in 2020 compared to this point in the 2016 presidential election. Absentee balloting by nonpartisans is up 139%. Republican activity is down 10%.
 In-person early voting will continue through Nov. 2. Mail-in absentee ballots must be postmarked by Nov. 2.

COLUMBUS, Ga. (WTVM) - The presidential election is less than a month away and things are already getting heated in the Chattahoochee Valley with some people reporting their political signs being stolen and or vandalized.Every election year, people use political signs as a public way to show support for their candidates.Gerry Kennon and his wife are trying to do just that, but say their signage keeps getting stolen.“Someone hops this black fence and then reached over our privacy fence and took our flag and our pole during the midnight hours,” Kennon said.Kennon has now had to change the way he displays his patriotism.“At nine o’clock at night or so, I go and take them down and put them by the porch. Then, first thing in the morning, I go and put them back up,” Kennon said. “That way I don’t have to keep losing money out of my own pocket again.”Just a block away from Kennon’s home, two large political signs on private property on Whitesville Road endorsing President Donald Trump appear to be defaced.At first glance, it looks like someone spray painted the signs, but someone also posted a crude sticker on the back of one as well. News Leader 9 tried to catch up with the owners but they were not home.Someone who is caught stealing or vandalizing a sign from someone’s yard could face legal consequences, according to Sgt. Thomas Hill with the Columbus Police Department.“If signs are being vandalized, that would constitute criminal trespass," . Hill said. "If they are being removed, then that is theft.”The only exception for signs to be removed from the property is if those signs are placed in the city right of way property, according to the Columbus Special Codes and Enforcement Division within the Columbus Consolidated Government.“The city will come out there and remove those signs if they are in violation," Hill said. "If someone were removing those signs, we would not look at it as a criminal offense because they should not be there to begin with.”Kennon said the incidents are more disheartening than anything else.“It’s a sad world right now. As America, we have the right to vote for who we want to vote for and we can all be friends; Democrat, Republican, whatever you are, black, white, or Asian," Kennon said.

As anyone who might have grown their hair out during quarantine can attest, having longer hair requires more time and effort when it comes to washing and styling. In a recent video, YouTuber Greg Berzinsky explained how he only washes his hair once a week, and then demonstrated how he styles it for seven consecutive days.
 Berzinsky starts out with squeaky clean hair on Day 1, having washed and conditioned it, and wearing it down, it looks straighter than usual due to a lack of the humidity that's typical of his native Philadelphia. "One of the problems with this weather is it's dry, so I tend to have some flyaways," he says.

In reality, the President's infection was the predictable result after months of blatantly disregarding basic public health guidance. While aides took steps to keep Trump from catching coronavirus, the White House's ultimate failure and the ensuing West Wing outbreak can be tied to an over-reliance on rapid coronavirus testing and disregard for the most basic and effective public health measures that have become second nature to most Americans: wearing a mask and social distancing.

France's 7-1 thrashing of Ukraine was the pick of the European friendlies on Wednesday as Spain clung on for a draw in Lisbon and Turkey saved pride with a late goal against Germany in Cologne.
 At the Stade de France it was teenager Eduardo Camavinga and veteran Olivier Giroud inflicting much of the damage for Didier Deschamps' world champions on Covid-19 hit Ukraine.
 The 17-year-old Camavinga put himself on the map becoming the youngest man to score for France in over a century with an audacious overhead flick for the ninth minute opener.
 Deschamps made Giroud captain for his 100th appearance and in return the Chelsea forward scored a first-half brace that left him on 42 international goals, just nine short of Thiery Henry on 51.
 "Well that's two more in the bag and it was already quite a significant haul wasn't it," said Deschamps, who has persisted with Giroud over the years when France seemed to be coming down with top strikers.
 "I'll just carry on and see how far it goes," said Giroud, 34.
 PSG's Kylian Mbappe, Bayern Munich's Corentin Tolisso and Barcelona striker Antoine Griezmann were also on the mark with fine strikes.
 Ukraine's team had been so ravaged by injury and the coronavirus they included a 45-year-old coach as second 'keeper for the night.
 European champions in 2016 Portugal return to the Stade de France in the Nations League on Sunday and used a friendly with their Iberian rivals Spain to warm up.
 Cristiano Ronaldo and Renato Sanchez both struck the woodwork for Portugal, who then should have won it in injury-time only for Joao Felix to miskick at the back post.
 Spain were the better team early on at the Jose Alvalade stadium and also went close.
 "I think we were better than Portugal," said Spain coach Luis Enrique. "For sure they had two shots on the break that hit the bar and one that Kepa saved but we had chances as well."
 Both sit top of their Nations League groups, Portugal with maximum points after beating Croatia and Sweden while Spain have four after thrashing Ukraine and drawing with Germany.
 \- 'I'm disappointed' -
 Germany coach Joachim Loew bemoaned his side’s inability to hold on to a lead after they conceded a last-gasp equaliser in a thrilling 3-3 draw against Turkey.
 Stuttgart-born Kenan Karaman bundled in a late leveller against the country of his birth as Turkey fought back from behind three times to snatch a draw and leave Loew scratching his head.
 "I’m disappointed and frustrated. We have had this problem for a while, and the same thing happened in other games," the Germany coach told broadcaster RTL.
 The draw was Germany’s third in three games, and the third time in a row that they have failed to win after taking the lead.
 Veteran striker Francesco Caputo scored on his Italy debut with Stephan El Shaarawy adding a brace as an experimental Azzurri side crushed Moldova 6-0.
 Roberto Mancini lined out with Italy's 'B' side without their stars as the Italians build towards next year's European championships, having failed to reach the 2018 World Cup.
 Against the modest Moldovans the Italians extended Mancini's unbeaten run to 17 consecutive games, with 14 wins and three draws.
 "I've seen so many interesting things," said Mancini, whose side were five goals up at the break.
 Italy, top of their Nations Leagues group with four points, play in Poland on Sunday and the Netherlands in Bergamo next Wednesday, with both on three points.

MYRTLE BEACH, S.C. (WMBF) - To many people, Jacob Hancher was a Myrtle Beach police officer and a volunteer firefighter, but to one Grand Strand organization, he was more than that.Hancher was a member of F3 Grand Strand, an all men’s fitness group, for four and a half years.In that time, members said they grew to know and cherish Hancher as part of their brotherhood.“He was certainly a very fine young man and had goals and aspirations and was very open about what those goals and aspirations were,” F3 member Matt Harris said.F3 stands for Fitness, Fellowship and Faith. The organization consists of peer-led workout groups that meet every morning.That’s how Harris came to know Hancher.Harris said Hancher joined the fitness organization to get into shape for the police academy. He often expressed his passion for law enforcement.“It was part of his DNA to give to the community, to have a heart of service,” Harris said.Every F3 member has a nickname. Harris said Hancher’s was “Hightower,” after the character in the film Police Academy.“Knowing his goal and aspiration was to get to the police academy, it just made perfect sense,” he said.However, his goal was short- lived.Seven months after becoming a certified police officer, Hancher was shot and killed Saturday night while responding to a domestic call on 14th Avenue South and Yaupon Drive.“Jacob was obviously in his mid-twenties, so much life ahead of him, so much more to offer this community and give to this community,” Harris said.But to be able to see Hancher’s dream turn into reality, Harris said, gives his F3 brothers a little peace of mind.“He achieved his goal,” Harris said. “He became a police officer. He served this community at such a high level.”F3 Grand Strand will hold a workout event in honor of Hancher Saturday, October 10 at 7 a.m. It’ll be on Forbus Court at the Market Common and open to the public.Copyright 2020 WMBF.

AMARILLO, Texas (KFDA) - With fewer people wanting to be police officers lately, it has been difficult for the current officers to respond to calls more efficiently.The portrait for the 95th graduating class for Amarillo’s Police Academy is set to be hung up on the wall.The class had 23 members graduate and it could have been a bit bigger if more people applied.Over the past two years, the Amarillo Police Department has seen a 100 to 200 decline in applicants.“It seems over the past few years, the applications coming in to be police officers has really gone down. You know it’s really hard to say why that is, but a lot of it probably has to do with what’s happening around the country,” said Jeb Hilton, the public information officer at the Amarillo Police Department.The decrease in applicants has led to the decrease of people graduating the academy.With less staff joining the department, it’s been a little more difficult to get to every call right away.“We have a shortage in patrol officers and that causes our priorities to change a little bit, obviously were going to respond to the emergency calls first, but it may cause a delay in non-emergency calls,” said Martin Birkenfeld, chief of police at the Amarillo Police Department.Birkenfeld says examples of these non-emergency calls are where the suspect isn’t there anymore or a delayed report.He says it’s also difficult to provide neighborhood policing when they always on the run.It forces the department to take officers away from the original duties.“There are a few specialized units out there that have lost people due to us having to make sure we have enough patrolling out there,” said Hilton.Hilton says when patrol officers are shifted to a major crime, they have about three to four fewer than normal.The department is reaching out to people on social media a bit more to increase applicants for future academies.Copyright 2020 KFDA.

The San Jose Sharks acquired forward Ryan Donato from the Wild in exchange for a third-round pick in the 2021 NHL Draft, Minnesota announced Monday.


  Also on Monday, the Wild announced that they re-signed forward Nico Sturm to a two-year, $1.45 million contract and re-signed defenseman Carson Soucy to a three-year, $8.25 million contract.


  Donato, 24, recorded career highs in goals (14), points (23) and games played (62) this past season. He did not notch a point in two games during Minnesota's qualifying-round loss versus Vancouver.


  Donato has collected 57 points (29 goals, 28 assists) in 130 career games with the Bruins and Wild since being selected by Boston in the second round of the 2014 NHL Draft.


  Sturm, 25, had two assists in six regular-season games this past season. Sturm recorded his first career NHL point with an assist at Arizona on Dec. 19.


  Soucy, 26, tallied 14 points (seven goals, seven assists) in 55 games in his first full season with the Wild in 2019-20. He also set a franchise rookie record for plus/minus rating at plus-16.


  TSN reported that the Sharks and Wild are separately working on a deal involving Minnesota goaltender Devan Dubnyk.


  Dubnyk, 34, posted a 12-15-2 record with one shutout, a 3.35 goals-against average and career-worst .890 save percentage this past season.

Despite a strong sense of place, having been shot in Baltimore, too much of the narrative feels anonymous and bland.

En 1978, la Academia Sueca justificó el Nobel de Literatura para Isaac Bashevis Singer con unos cuantos argumentos, entre ellos: "Por su apasionado arte narrativo que, con sus raíces en la tradición cultural polaco-judía, otorga vida a las condiciones humanas universales". Cuatro décadas después, este legado que supera las fronteras de lo literario revive con la publicación de _El huésped_ (Nórdica Libros), un relato inédito del escritor sobre los supervivientes del Holocausto que emigraron y crearon el conocido barrio neoyorquino de Williamsburg. Bashevis Singer usaba el yidis para, según dijo, "relatar las cosas de los judíos, que siempre han oscilado entre la vida y la muerte. Para los judíos, la muerte sólo puede mencionarse en yidis". En este cuento, descubierto en 2018 por la revista _The New Yorker_ , el escritor narra el destino de los supervivientes del Holocausto a través de dos personajes con distinta fortuna.

Using IAP raises costs for developers, several testified. For apps that compete directly against Apple's own first-party services, they said, paying Apple for the privilege of making less money doesn't make economic sense—that's the heart of Spotify's complaint against Apple. But developers also say they can't leave iOS, because although iPhone users are a minority of the market, they tend by and large to have more money and be bigger spenders than Android users. (Several of these developers joined together earlier this fall to launch a trade group pushing for Apple to lower its fees and untie the App Store from IAP.)

Once in a while, though, the flesh has its way in the affairs of ministers and they go gaga before their followers. Rather than rebuke the devil for their fathers in the Lord, they hail them, indirectly endorsing their misdemeanour. Yes, a priest is first and foremost a man with all the foibles and frailties, but having been ordained a minister, he is a step or two above other men. He looks unto God for direction and is in the Spirit always to avoid falling into temptation. He should more than his spiritual children, who follow him blindly, imbibe the biblical injunction: we walk by faith not by sight. When a minister allows the flesh to take control of him, that is walking by sight, he departs from the spiritual realm and becomes of the world.

US Open champion Bryson DeChambeau brings his big-hitting game back to TPC Summerlin this week, aiming to add a second victory in Las Vegas to his resume as he looks toward next months' Masters.
 It was a year ago in Las Vegas -- after a tie for fourth in his defense of his 2019 title -- that DeChambeau confided his plan to bulk up his body in a quest for greater distance.
 "You're going to see some pretty big changes in my body, which is going to be a good thing," he said. "Going to be hitting it a lot further."
 His approach has yielded dividends, most notably an impressive first major title at last month's pandemic-delayed US Open at Winged Foot, where he tossed convention out the window with booming drives and used his strength to muscle his way out of trouble.
 A win this week might bear little resemblance to his 2019 victory, with DeChambeau saying he could reach as many as four of the course's par-fours off the tee and can certainly reach all of the par-fives in two.
 "There will be holes where I'm going to try and drive them, get it up as close to the green as possible," DeChambeau said Wednesday. "There will be holes where I had to hit three-wood and now I'm hitting four-iron off the tees."
 DeChambeau gave onlookers a taste of what to expect on the driving range. The PGA Tour posted video on Twitter of DeChambeau bombing practice drives from 40 yards behind his rivals.
 He is paired in the first two rounds with Cameron Champ, the player DeChambeau supplanted atop the tour's driving distance rankings, and big-hitting Matthew Wolff, who was runner-up to DeChambeau at the US Open and the Rocket Mortgage Classic last July.
 But even though DeChambeau has made distance a priority, he said it's not the only key to his game.
 "At the same point in time it's about putting, chipping, wedging," he said. "You've still got to do everything else really well.
 "So if I play well, ball strike it well, and putt well, I think I'll have a good chance again. Love this golf course."
 The player nicknamed "The Professor" has been busy experimenting since his US Open victory, notably with a longer, 48-inch driver that he hopes to unveil at Augusta National.
 "Still need to get some things worked out, but so far it's been pretty amazing," he said.

SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — As the coronavirus sweeps through the upper reaches of government, Republican Vice President Mike Pence and Democratic challenger Kamala Harris face off Wednesday night in a debate highlighting the parties' sharply conflicting visions for a nation in crisis.
 The candidates will be separated by plexiglass barriers in an auditorium where any guest who refuses to wear a face mask will be removed, an extraordinary backdrop for the only vice presidential debate of 2020.
 Ultimately, the prime-time meeting is a chance for voters to decide whether Pence or Harris, a U.S. senator from California, is ready to assume the duties of the presidency before the end of the next term. It's hardly a theoretical question: President Donald Trump, 74, is recovering from the coronavirus, and 77-year-old Joe Biden has not been infected but would be the oldest president ever.
 For those reasons and more, the debate at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City may be the most meaningful vice presidential debate in recent memory. It comes at a precarious moment for the Republicans in particular, with growing concern that Trump's position is weakening as more than a dozen senior officials across the White House, the Pentagon and inside his campaign are infected with the virus or in quarantine.
 Trailing in polls, Trump and Pence have no time to lost; Election Day is less than four weeks away, and millions of Americans are already casting ballots.
 Before Harris says a word, she will make history by becoming the first Black woman to stand on a vice presidential debate stage. The night offers her a prime opportunity to energize would-be voters who have shown only modest excitement about Biden, a lifelong politician with a mixed record on race and criminal justice, particularly in his early years in the Senate.
 Harris, a 55-year-old California senator, is the daughter of a Jamaican father and an Indian mother. She is also a former prosecutor whose pointed questioning of Trump's appointees and court nominees helped make her a Democratic star.
 Pence is a 61-year-old former Indiana governor and ex-radio host, an evangelical Christian known for his folksy charm and unwavering loyalty to Trump. And while he is Trump's biggest public defender, the vice president does not share the president's brash tone or undisciplined style.
 Just eight days ago, Trump set the tone for the opening presidential debate, which was perhaps the ugliest in modern history. Wednesday's affair is expected to be far more respectful.
 Harris advisers say she does not plan to constantly fact-check Pence on stage and will instead spend her time making the case directly to the American people about what a Biden-Harris administration would offer.
 "She's not there to eviscerate Mike Pence," said Symone Sanders, an adviser who has been in Harris' debate prep. "She is there to really talk to people at home."
 Harris' team predicted she would focus on Trump's yearlong efforts to downplay the pandemic, the fact that many schools are still closed and Trump's declaration this week that he would end talks on a fresh coronavirus economic relief package until after the election.
 Harris will also have the chance to explain her views on law enforcement, an area in which she's irked some progressives, given her past as a prosecutor.
 Meanwhile, Pence aims to highlight the administration's economic record and attempt to portray the Democratic ticket as beholden to the "radical left," former GOP Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, who is helping the vice president prepare for the debate, said on "Fox & Friends."
 Just as Harris will likely speak directly to Trump at times, Pence is likely to speak at Biden and progressives, who have called for a government run health care system known as "Medicare for All" and sweeping environmental reforms to combat climate change called the "Green New Deal." Biden opposes both plans in favor of more moderate steps that would still be among the most significant changes for health care and environmental policy in the modern era.
 Pence will be joined in the debate hall by several guests, including the parents of Kayla Mueller, a humanitarian aid worker who was killed in 2015 by Islamic State militants. Their presence is intended to highlight Trump's record on national security, including the killing of the group's leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.
 While the debate will cover a range of topics, the virus will be at the forefront.
 Pence serves as chair of the president's coronavirus task force, which has failed to implement a comprehensive national strategy even as Trump himself recovers from the disease and the national death toll surges past 210,000 with no end in sight.
 The candidates will appear on stage exactly 12.25 feet (3.7 meters) apart and separated by plexiglass barriers. Both candidates released updated coronavirus test results ahead of the debate proving they were negative as of Tuesday.
 Critics suggested that Pence should not be at the debate at all.
 The vice president attended an event last week at the White House with Trump and others who have since tested positive, but Pence's staff and doctors insist he does not need to quarantine under Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines. The CDC defines risky "close contact" as being within 6 feet (1.8 meters) of an infected person for at least 15 minutes starting from two days before the onset of symptoms or a positive test.
 While some Democrats have set high expectations for the debate, Harris and her allies have been trying to keep them low.
 "We know that Vice President Pence is formidable debater, and we know that tonight is a challenge," said Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J. "But all those who know and love Kamala just have a lot of confidence in her."

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump on Wednesday tried to salvage a few priority items lost in the rubble of COVID-19 relief talks that he himself blew up, pressing for $1,200 stimulus checks and new aid for airlines and other businesses hard hit by the pandemic. But it's not clear whether he can undo the self-inflicted political damage so close to the election.
 In a barrage of tweets, Trump pressed for passage of these chunks of assistance, an about-face from his abrupt and puzzling move on Tuesday afternoon to abandon talks with a longtime rival, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. The California Democrat has rejected such piecemeal entreaties all along.
 Trump's tweets amounted to him demanding his way in negotiations that he himself had ended. Trump, who absorbed much political heat for abandoning the talks, is the steward of an economy whose continued recovery may hinge on significant new steps such as pandemic unemployment benefits. His tweets seemed to move the financial markets into positive territory, though it was far from certain whether they would impress voters demanding more relief.
 He called on Congress to send him a "Stand Alone Bill for Stimulus Checks ($1,200)" — a reference to a preelection batch of direct payments to most Americans that had been a central piece of negotiations between Pelosi and the White House.
 "I am ready to sign right now. Are you listening Nancy?" Trump said on Twitter Tuesday evening. He also urged Congress to immediately approve $25 billion for airlines and $135 billion for the Paycheck Protection Program to help small businesses.
 The stock market fell precipitously after Trump pulled the plug on the talks but was recovering Wednesday after he floated the idea of piecemeal aid.
 Trump's decision to scuttle talks between Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Pelosi came after the president was briefed on the landscape for the negotiations — and on the blowback that any Pelosi-Mnuchin deal probably would have received from his GOP allies in Congress.
 "It became very obvious over the last couple of days that a comprehensive bill was just going to get to a point where it didn't have really much Republican support at all," White House chief of staff Mark Meadows said Wednesday on Fox News. "It was more of a Democrat-led bill, which would have been problematic, more so in the Senate than in the House."
 Pelosi told reporters that "all the president wants is his name on a check" for direct aid payments.
 The unexpected turn could be a blow to Trump's reelection prospects and comes as his administration and campaign are in turmoil. Trump is quarantining in the White House with a case of the coronavirus, and the latest batch of opinion polls shows him significantly behind Democrat Joe Biden with the election four weeks away.
 Trump's withdrawal from the talks came immediately after he spoke with the GOP leaders in Congress, Many Republican senators had signaled they would not be willing to go along with any measure that topped $1 trillion, and GOP aides had been privately dismissive of the prospects for a deal. Any Pelosi- sponsored agreement of close to $2 trillion raised the potential of a GOP revolt if such a plan came to a vote.
 Pelosi and Mnuchin talked briefly on Wednesday morning about the chances for a stand-alone airline rescue, Pelosi spokesman Drew Hammill tweeted. Pelosi directed Mnuchin to a measure she had attempted to pass on Friday on short notice under fast-track procedures, but only after Democrats made a number of changes Republicans did not like.
 The talks have been troubled from their start in July and never appeared to close in on an agreement both sides could embrace.
 Pelosi had been demanding a host of Democratic priorities on food aid, unemployment benefits, help for renters and homeowners, and aid to state and local governments. Republicans charged she was dragging the talks to deny Trump a political victory before the Nov. 3 election.
 Early rounds of virus aid passed by overwhelming margins as the economy went into lockdown in March. After that, Trump and many of his GOP allies focused on loosening social and economic restrictions as the key to recovery instead of more taxpayer-funded help.
 Still, the decision to halt negotiations now could be politically perilous. While the stock market has clawed much of its way back after cratering in the early weeks of the crisis, unemployment stands at 7.9%, and the nearly 11 million jobs that remain lost since the start of the pandemic exceed the number that the nation shed during the entire 2008-09 Great Recession.
 The economy has recovered more quickly than most economists had expected, largely because of the aid Congress approved in a $2 trillion package in March. The $1,200 stimulus checks, supplemental $600 unemployment benefits each week, and aid to small businesses boosted household incomes and enabled many low-income Americans to pay bills and rent and maintain their overall spending, according to data from Opportunity Insights.
 But the recovery has slowed and certain sectors such as restaurants, hotels, theaters and airlines remain in bad shape, shedding jobs and risking permanent realignment. Without more stimulus, economists expect growth will slow significantly in the final three months of the year.
 "You're going to see quite a significant drag on growth," said Gregory Daco, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, a consulting firm. It "would really risk a double-dip recession."

 The move, if confirmed, would be another body blow for the hard-pressed hospitality industry in the regions already reeling from the imposition of the controversial 10pm curfew.

You cannot tell your sheep to keep their heads while you lose yours. You cannot tell them to love their neighbours as themselves while you do otherwise. All eyes are on you as a priest because your followers are learning from you.

TKD followed exactly this route by being a merge of several ancient arts from Korea and the neighbouring countries, with a strong influence from Karate. The person considered being the father and highly respected founder of TKD was General Choi Hong Hi who was an experienced martial artist from South Korea: he had the opportunity of studying Karate while living in Japan during the Japanese occupation of South Korea and he defined TKD in the late 50es.

Adult redfish usually live in deep water offshore, until this time of year when they come in to “collect” newly matured redfish for the spawn. So they prefer to be near deep water and sometimes even just hang out in deeper water. When they’re feeding in shallow areas, it makes them feel more comfortable to know that there’s deeper water nearby.
 To actually catch a redfish in one of these spots, most of the time I am going to have pinfish, ladyfish, mullet, crabs or something else I can cut up. I have more success sitting in one spot and not moving around — I want those schools to come to me. Cut bait puts a lot of scent in the water, which means I don’t have to move around scaring them and probably just pushing them all over the place.
 Now I do like to throw lures at them sometimes, usually when I’m by myself or with just one other person. My go-to lure is a single-hook weedless gold spoon. You can cover a lot of water with it and the redfish love it.
 I also throw a lot of soft plastic paddletails of all different sizes and colors, but I always put them on a Rockport Rattler jighead. I wish I could tell you to just go pick some up at Fishin' Frank's, but since that's not possible right now I've been going to ChickyTackle.com.
 If we don’t end with a hurricane on top of us, the redfish action ought to be really good out there. Check the types of places they like, look for mullet schools, don’t do anything to scare them away, and you should do great.

COLUMBIA, S.C. (WIS) - A South Carolina judge has asked two law firms that were wired $75 million from the state last week to not spend that money.The money is from a $600 million plutonium removal settlement between the state and the federal government.South Carolina Attorney General Alan Wilson announced the settlement in August. The settlement gives the Department of Energy up to 2037 to remove 9.5 metric tons of weapons-grade plutonium from the Savannah River Site. The plutonium was relocated to SRS in the early 2000s.Attorney General Wilson said two private law firms, Willoughby &amp; Hoefer, P.A., and Davidson, Wren &amp; DeMasters, P.A., will be receiving $75 million in legal fees for their help with court cases over the years and for coming up with the legal strategy to get the settlement. According to Attorney General Wilson’s biography on his office’s website, Wilson previously worked at the Columbia firm of Willoughby &amp; Hoefer, P.A.A watchdog group filed a lawsuit aiming to have the courts decide who can disperse the money. “Our argument is the Attorney General does not have any authority to disperse any of the $600 million in the settlement,” Attorney and watchdog John Crangle said. “That money should go to the General Fund and the General Assembly decides how to spend it.”During a virtual court hearing Wednesday, attorneys representing the law firms and Attorney General’s office said Wilson does have the authority to disperse the money and the fees are fair based on a contract they had signed off on.They did not want to go on camera Wednesday since the case is ongoing.A circuit judge extended the freeze on the money for another week or until she makes a ruling.Attorneys representing Crangle have filed a request for the Supreme Court of South Carolina to take up the case. “We think the money should remain frozen until the courts can determine how much legal fees they’re owed and who can pay the money out,” Crangle said.Copyright 2020 WIS.

Most of my life I’ve done what I had to and not what I wanted to — but that’s changing. I didn’t win the lottery, but I’ve accepted that it’s now or never. I’m writing this before sunrise on my birthday (I’m 72 now). I was planning to fish with a good friend yesterday, but he had a stroke exactly when we were to go out.
 It looks like he’ll be OK, but it was still scary. It’s a reminder that we have to get things in order and take advantage of the precious time we have.
 I just returned from traveling to visit friends and explore. Maybe I’ll share my adventures on the Nature Coast next time, but for now I want to share a wonderful experience fly fishing for giant trout. Western North Carolina and northern Georgia is beautiful country. The clear streams with their distinctive sounds of rushing water over rocks is wonderful even without catching fish. I’ve had some success there in public water, but I’ve always wanted to try it first-class.
 I had a young friend who guided trout professionally. He got me totally hooked with stories of big, strong, beautiful trout, so I decided to give myself a birthday present and booked a private waters flyfishing trip for myself and my friend Mike Collins.
 We went with Blackhawk Fly Fishing of Clarksville, Ga. (just a few miles south of the North Carolina border). The cost got my attention, but I wanted the opportunity to experience the best fishing possible. This time I got more than I could have expected!
 We had an hour-plus drive through dark mountain roads, but Mike lives there half of the year now and delivered us safely. As we drove in, the old log cabin construction showed us they were concerned about taking care of things.
 You can fish here with or without a guide. Knowing the value of a good guide, we opted to have one. Our host, Abby, introduced us to our guide and laughed when she said his name was Logan Hubbard. I don’t think we’re related, but you never know. We had a challenge finding wading gear for my big feet but soon got underway.
 As we walked down to the stream, Logan explained our game plan and then helped me understand the right presentation style of casting and drifting. Do it correctly and catch fish. If not, at least you still get to see the fish. He demonstrated and immediately hooked a brilliantly radiant 4-pound rainbow trout.
   
 He made it look so easy, but it took me some time to master casting in tight quarters (no back casting), then learning to mend my fly line. It’s necessary to flip the heavier fly line upstream, allowing the proper drift of your offering. A natural drift presentation is critical to success. Soon I was doing it well enough to get bites.
 My first hookup was a monster brown trout, with brilliant colors and fat as it could be. It required skill to allow it to run with the current, then add just enough pressure to the light 6-pound tippet to bring it back toward me. I was so excited at the fish’s beauty and strength I was shaking. I came for the big trout, and I had everything I dreamed of on my first take.
 After several minutes, she allowed me to lead her into the net; she barely fit! I just looked at her for a minute as she rested in the water. Then I wet my hands and we shot a few quick photos. Logan said she was 9 or 10 pounds. My dream had been granted.
 But just a few minutes later I managed another, almost as big. Then the rainbows got going. They’re even faster, plus they jump. We moved around, enjoying the fact that we had two miles of stream to ourselves. I caught trout till my arms hurt, rested and then caught more.
 Most of the time we could see fish trophy-sized trout in the water, and were frequently watching several fish at a time. I caught fish on consecutive casts multiple times. The colorful rainbows were so fast several broke me off before I could react and release the line.
 This trip to Georgia was an adventure to remember. It’s not something I can do frequently, but it’s a treat I will try again if I am allowed. We created memories I’ll treasure forever. Sometimes we get what we pay for, and this was first-class — everything I dreamed of and more.
 Remember that you can’t catch fish if you don’t go fishin’, so let’s go fishin’ soon.

Lots of locals know about the Nav-A-Gator Bar and Grill, which is 7.5 miles north of U.S. 41 on King’s Highway in DeSoto County. We launch here and enjoy the kayak fishing in Deep Creek, then follow it up with a grouper sandwich and a cold beverage at this old-style Florida restaurant.
 The backwaters of Deep Creek, which connects to the Peace River right at the launch, create a refuge for snook, redfish and other fish as the waters cool down with the approaching winter. These saltwater species mingle with the largemouth bass that move downstream in this dry season. Virtually any local brackish water species can be caught here.
 The launch was improved with the construction of Deep Creek Park. In addition to picnic tables, restrooms and parking, the new boat ramp is paved and makes an easy spot to launch a kayak or canoe. We back down the ramp and unload our kayaks on the side before parking, but we dolly our kayaks from the parking area if the ramp is busy.
 Set up your kayak before you get to the ramp; it keeps the boaters happy. There is a paved walking path from the parking area to the ramp, so gravity is all you need to keep the kayak on the dolly — no straps required.
 Once on the water, crossing the Peace River takes you into the Lettuce Lake channel, which meanders north 1.5 miles to the ramp off of C.R. 761. One popular trip is to launch at the Lettuce Lake ramp, head towards the Nav-A- Gator for lunch, and then return. There is some boat traffic in this channel, but backwaters along the side are fun to explore and fish. Anywhere a smaller tribuary meets the main channel is a good place to make a cast or two.
 Our favorite float plan from Deep Creek Park is to head south on Deep Creek itself. Ook over this area on Google Maps before you launch here. Take a right turn out of the marina basin and fish the edges and spots where smaller creeks enter the main channel. This is named “Deep Creek” for a reason. The sandy, mangrove shorelines along here drop off quickly into the depths of the channel.
   
 Be sure to make a cast or two by the old boat you’ll see on the left. Work a jig along the bottom from the shore back to your kayak and stay in contact with the bottom. We start with a quarter-ounce jighead with a shad tail but go heavier if necessary. Dark natural colors like golden shiner and root beer work well, but some anglers prefer brighter colors in this tannic water. Of course, topwater lures and flies will also work early and late in the day.
 The main channel between the Peace River and Deep Creek is about three- quarters of a mile south from the launch, on the left side. Once you find this channel, stay to the right and you’ll end up on the Peace River. There are some sandy beaches across the Peace River — great places to park and stretch your legs. Where we stopped one time, there was even a rope swing for folks who wanted to swim with gators.
 On our first trip to this area, we explored the back waters between Deep Creek and the Peace River. There are a few channels that connect — but many, many more that do not. We found ourselves paddling up one dead end slough and then down another for quite a while. It was frustrating hearing the boats on the Peace River so near yet so far away. We eventually found the opening we were looking for and learned to bring our handheld GPS along.
 Lacking one of these gadgets, we recommend some marking string if you decide to explore the backwater labyrinths of Deep Creek. All these mangrove shorelines look alike after a while. We usually paddle back on the Peace River, but there are two other cross-over channels farther south on Deep Creek.
 This is a great spot with an easy launch and a restaurant nearby to celebrate the day’s adventure. Whether you catch fish or not, this area is protected from most winter winds, large boat wakes, red tide and anything else that might detract from a fun day on the water. And did we mention the grouper sandwich?
 Kimball and Les Beery, authors of the waterproof "Angler's Guide to Shore Fishing Southwest Florida" and "Angler's Guide to Kayak Fishing Southwest Florida," contribute these columns to promote the excellent fishing available in Southwest Florida. Their books are available at most tackle shops in the area, AnglerPocketGuides.com, or Amazon as a download or hard copy.

Small businesses in the region have felt the strain and uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic, and that has made it hard for owners to grow their businesses.
 As a way to help spur local economic development and to stimulate job creation, the South Central Ozark Council of Governments (SCOCOG) offers a revolving loan fund capitalized through the Economic Development Administration under the U.S. Department of Commerce. It gets its name from the rotating nature of lending process, which allows new loans to be made as old loans are being settled.
 SCOCOG Economic Development Specialist Darci Malam explained that, because of temporary relaxed restrictions and an increase in funding from the federal government, the agency has a little over $900,000 in funds available to lend to small businesses in its region, which covers the counties of Douglas, Howell, Oregon, Ozark, Shannon, Texas and Wright.
 “If they meet the qualifications, we can offer a loan for up to $100,000 at an interest rate of 3.25% for 10 to 15 years,” said Malam. “These funds can be used to purchase equipment, land acquisition, building construction or reconstruction, or pay for employee educational training.”
 For every $35,000 loaned out, she added, the business is also expected to create one full-time position or two part-time positions as a stipulation of agreeing to the loan.
 Malam also explained that, right now, SCOCOG can work directly with small businesses to offer the loans. In the past, the loans had to be worked through local banks.
 “We are not competing with local banks,” Malam firmly stated. “The small business owners have to try their banks for a loan first, and if they are denied, then we can possibly help them.”
 She said the rules for the revolving loan fund have been changed in response to the pandemic, in order to help streamline the application process and possibly make funds available faster for small businesses.
 “Once the process starts — and everything goes right — it takes about two months for the business to receive the loan,” said Malam.
 To begin the loan process, after the local bank avenue has been exhausted, Malam suggests contacting her first through email at dmalam@scocog.org or by calling the SCOCOG office at 256-4226.
 An application will have to be filled out and submitted; the fee to process the application is $250, which can be refunded, prorated, anytime during the application process if the loan is denied. There is also a 2% origination fee once the loan is approved. For example if a business is approved for $100,000, the fee will be $2,000.
 She also said that, during the application process, the small business owner will have to work with Darrell Hampsten, local coordinator with the Missouri Small Business Development Center in West Plains. Together, Hampsten and the applicant will develop a plan, demonstrate the need for the funds and show how they will be used.
 Unfortunately, the revolving loan fund isn’t available for small businesses in financial trouble or ones that cannot pay money already owed.
 “The reason this loan isn’t for struggling small businesses is the government expects to be repaid on the loan,” Malam said, explaining that it’s an essential feature for the fund to be replenished by repayment to allow for future projects to be funded.
 “The focus of the revolving loan fund has been economic development and job creation,” Malam said.
 According to her, since the inception of the SCOCOG program in the mid-1980s, a total of 89 loans have been made and have been responsible for creating over 900 jobs, in addition to saving another 450 in the seven-county region.
 “If you’re a local small business owner or a viable start-up needing help to get off the ground, the revolving loan fund can help with funding certain projects,” Malam said.

All you have to do is wait a few years, and then all of those Gen Zers and high school seniors will grow up into your target demographic. And then you’ve been right there with them all along.

FALCON: FAIR. Water lightly stained north and clear south; 84 degrees; 37.18' low. Falcon is in the full fall swing with shallow structures taking center stage as conditions continue to improve. Black bass are fair working vegetation, continuing to submerged houses and natural formations. Catches are good-sized, typically between 4-7 lbs, and will come on the first couple of casts. Big bass are over brush, and you should be tossing large plastic worms, plastic crawfish, and square billed crankbait. The white bass are great moving throughout most structures but especially on the rocks with crankbait. Crappie are excellent in cove or creek structures and over brush. Catfish are always biting, and constant cloudy water help. Remember to stay on the Texas side unless you possess a Mexican fishing license.
