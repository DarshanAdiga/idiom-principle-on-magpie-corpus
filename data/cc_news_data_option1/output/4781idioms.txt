This morning I walked five kilometres around the gorge in the pummeling rain and would have been a drowned rat by the time I got home but I dressed for the weather and was thankful to feel the refreshment of the raindrops on my face. It was very windy so I had to look up every so often when walking under one of the ancient cedars here as it is not uncommon for large branches to fall on people here on especially windy days.

“In my Oval Office, mi casa, you casa,” Biden, who sat with Schumer, Pelosi and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, all wearing masks and spaced out around a bank of tables, said during the brief portion of the meeting journalists witnessed. “I hope we’re going to spend a lot of time together.”
 According to a readout of the meeting later released by Biden's team, the group “agreed that Congress needed to pass a bipartisan emergency aid package in the lame duck session," which is the period after Election Day but before Congress adjourns for the year.
 It added that the “package should include resources to fight the COVID-19 pandemic, relief for working families and small businesses, support for state and local governments trying to keep frontline workers on the payroll, expanded unemployment insurance, and affordable health care for millions of families."
 The sense of urgency in the meeting was echoed in comments earlier Friday by Biden transition aide Jen Psaki, who warned that “there's no more room for delay."
 Pelosi said before meeting with Biden and Schumer that she'd make clear “the urgency of crushing the virus,” and how to use the lame-duck session to approve COVID-19 relief and legislation that can keep the government funded.
 But prospects for new virus aid this year remain uncertain. Pelosi said talks with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and GOP leadership on Thursday did not produce any consensus on an aid package.
 “That didn’t happen, but hopefully it will,” she said.
 Also Friday, McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, proposed that Congress shift $455 billion of unspent small-business lending funds toward a new COVID-19 aid package. His offer came after a meeting with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and White House chief of staff Mark Meadows.
 Psaki said Biden, Pelosi and Schumer had already begun working together on COVID-19 relief even before Friday's meeting.

One of my young grandsons recently did something at his preschool for which he was appropriately reprimanded. When he refused to apologize to the other student involved, he was put in “time-out” until he was prepared to own up to his wrongdoing. After a few minutes in that disciplinary position, he was once again approached by his teacher asking him if we was ready to say “I’m sorry.” He responded, “No, I’m not ready yet.” I guess he was being honest about his feelings, but was obviously letting his stubbornness get in the way of what he knew he needed to do.
 As we approach this special time we’ve set aside each year for expressing our gratitude, are you ready to say, “Thank You, Lord”? In light of the year we’ve been having, will some of us find it more difficult not only to say the words we know are appropriate but also to truly feel a sense of gratefulness in our hearts for what the Lord has done for us? As Thanksgiving Day draws near, are some of us having to honestly admit, “I’m not ready yet”? I’m not talking about not being ready to get together with family, to prepare a big meal, or jump into the midst of another holiday season. I’m referring to the fact that some of us may not be ready to set aside how we feel about all that has been going in our world over these past months and sincerely express thanks to the Lord.
 Many of us know that we still have reason to be grateful. We can mentally count our blessings and remind ourselves that our situations could be worse. However, in spite of what we know, we’re finding it difficult to pull away from the prevailing atmosphere full of complaints, disappointments, fears and anxieties over constantly having to adjust our lives from what has been our normal for so long. We know we should be thankful, but we’re just not ready yet.

However, when the 20th century rolled around, Santa Maria was becoming too large to be handled only by a judge and constable. In 1905 there were almost 3,000 people living here. The old board sidewalks were becoming macadam strips, forerunners of the present concrete walks. The community began to assume the air of a municipality, and with it came additional problems that could only be dealt with by a city government.
 At a special election held on Sept. 12, 1905, residents of this little town voted to incorporate, and the rest is history.
 For trustees (now the city council), they chose Alvin W. Cox, Sam Fleisher, Reuben Hart, Emmett T. Bryant and William Mead. John E Walker was elected clerk.
 The first regular meeting of the board was held at 7:30 p.m. on Sept. 21, 1905 with all members, and City Clerk Walker, present. Their initial work was concerned mostly with getting the necessary machinery of city government into motion.

After its initial “growth spurt,” she said that the county focused mostly on building homes and growing residentially, which created an imbalance in commercial and residential property tax revenues. Semanson said that the county’s current split is 70% residential and 30% commercial, where they want to see the county move closer to 40% commercial.
 Since the implementation of the economic development plan, which started last year, Semanson said that the county has seen an increase of 19% in the assessed value of properties owned by businesses. Another 21 new projects have also been announced in 2020 with a majority of those being in sectors such as advanced manufacturing, technology and e-commerce.
 Kristin Morrissey, the vice chair of the Forsyth County Board of Education, also gave an update on how the school district has been working to help in the economic development plan this year, speaking on the efforts of Workforce Forsyth, a workforce development pipeline.
 Morrissey said that an updated Workforce Forsyth plan will now guide career technology programing in the school district through 2021, promoting new career pathways that “align and fill gaps in business and industry in the county.”
 The school system has already started to implement several new career pathways in their high schools, including aerospace, mechatronics, energy systems, cybersecurity, financial technology, veterinary science and architecture drafting and design, which will be offered at East Forsyth High School next school year.
 Morrissey also emphasized how well the county has been able to pull through the pandemic economically so far, mentioning that the county’s sales tax revenue only fell by about 3% before increasing again by May this year. She attributed this to many in the county going out of their way to support businesses within their community.
 “Businesses and the community working together is another example of how economic development helps to build a strong local economy that benefits both our county and our school system,” Morrissey said.

China built a COVID-dedicated hospital in 10 days and flooded Hubei, the center of the initial outbreak, with 40,000 health workers. New Zealand implemented travel restrictions, placed incoming travelers into quarantine for 14 days and tested them regularly. That country canceled public events, restricted gatherings, closed workplaces, deployed stay-at-home orders, restricted internal movements, restricted public transport to essential workers, closed schools, tested all symptomatic patients, tested selected asymptomatic people, provided income support replacing 50 percent and more of lost income, and coordinated public information.

At least some didn't heed that appeal.
 One Trump observer was escorted from the building by sheriff's deputies Saturday after pushing an election official who had lifted her coat from an observer chair. Another was removed Friday for not wearing a face mask properly as coronavirus infection rates have soared in the state.
 "You have to stand back and sit down," one election official, flanked by deputies, told another Trump observer. "If you don't, you'll be escorted out." After arguing for a moment, the observer sat down.
 The county's election commissioners -- two Democrats and one Republican -- have been in almost perpetual session to address a stream of Trump challenges that county clerk George Christenson said was slowing the recount to a crawl and putting the process far behind schedule. On Saturday, election officials accused Trump representatives of flouting rules to obstruct and delay the recount, noting some of their observers were objecting to every ballot at a particular table. Challenges were being made over absentee ballots that were folded -- a necessary step for voters to put them in envelopes.
 Another Trump challenge sought to disqualify mail-in ballots submitted in envelopes with official stickers that had become unstuck.
 "Some of the stuff we're getting into is ridiculous," an increasingly exasperated Tim Posnanski, the commission chairman, said Saturday.
 When one Trump representative sounded dismissive about advice that Milwaukee County's corporation counsel, Margaret Daun, offered commissioners, she admonished him: "Please don't talk down to me, sir."
 While the recount itself almost certainly won't change the result, Trump's campaign appears to be intent on getting as many challenges on the record as possible so they can eventually ask a judge to toss whole categories of ballots. Trump lost to Biden in Milwaukee County, the state's most populous county that includes a large Black population, by more than a 2-to-1 margin. The focus of disputes are tens of thousands of absentee ballots.
 By law, the recount must be finished by Dec. 1. But by Saturday evening, few of the hundreds of Milwaukee tabulators had gotten around to actually counting votes, the county clerk said. They'd spent most of the two days since the process began Friday sorting ballot papers, including mail-in ballot envelopes and applications.
 Joe Voiland, speaking to commission members Saturday on behalf of the Trump campaign, denied his side was acting in bad faith.
 "I want to get to the point of dialing everything down … and not yelling at each other," Voiland said.
 Elections officials asked reporters not to speak to tabulators or observers as they worked. But Cerny was singled out to commissioners by name as an example of supporters posing as independents to get around rules limiting observers to one per table from each campaign. She stood, gave her name and asked to speak to commissioners but was told she couldn't.
 She wore a name tag on her blouse that identified her as an "independent observer," but when asked by a reporter if she was there to support Trump, she didn't hesitate. "Yes," she said. She declined to comment further.
 A Biden observer sitting next to Cerny earlier told her to lean back from the yellow line intended to separate observers from tabulators, then softened her tone.
 "We want every vote counted," she told Cerny, "just like you do."

Globally, one in 10 people lives on less than $1.90 per day, and if current trends continue, the World Food Programme predicts the number of hungry people will reach 840 million, or one-ninth of the world’s population, by 2030.
 Ending poverty in all its forms everywhere is the top goal of the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development supported by all 193 member states.
 The international community is stepping up efforts to achieve the goal, especially in response to the severe setback caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and to reduce human pressure on nature.
 One way to relieve the pressure and alleviate poverty is to recognize and further optimize the critical role of forests and trees as allies in the fight against poverty. In the long run, losing forests means losing this fight, based on findings of a new global assessment report.
 “Forests and trees are critical to the well-being of many of the world’s poor people who have been able to harness the goods and services they provide to manage risk, especially in the face of crises,” said University of Illinois associate professor Daniel Miller, who chaired a two-year investigation by a global panel of experts that produced the report. “To secure and improve this important function, we need to adequately protect, manage and restore forests and to make forests and trees more central in policy decision-making.”
 The study consolidates available scientific evidence on the wide range of contributions forests and trees make to curbing poverty and on the effectiveness of diverse forest management policies, programs, technologies and strategies.
 “More extreme weather events associated with climate change, widening inequality and the spread of infectious diseases, among others, are making an already insecure situation worse for the poor. It is therefore essential to review the role of forests in development in general, and in achieving poverty eradication, in particular,” said Hiroto Mitsugi, assistant director-general and chair of the Collaborative Partnership on Forests.
 The report concludes forests and trees can substantially improve human well- being and curb global poverty; although, these benefits are unevenly distributed.
 In many forest and wildlife-rich countries in Africa, for example, timber and tourism are major contributors to national economic accounts, but the benefits may not accrue at the local level and, worse, local communities may bear the cost of these activities through environmental degradation and restricted access to protected areas.
 Holiday spices
 University of Missouri Extension horticulturist David Trinklein says a key ingredient in traditional holiday foods and beverages also had a profound influence on civilization.
 Demand in Europe before and during the Renaissance led to a lucrative spice trade. When spice routes faltered due to political turmoil, European explorers sailed west in search of a shorter route to the spice-laden Indies, and the New World was discovered.
 Probably the oldest and most sought-after spice in history is cinnamon.
 Ancient Egyptians used it to embalm the dead, and it remains a common component of incense used in sacred ceremonies. Cinnamon was first widely used in food preparation in medieval Europe.
 Cinnamon comes from the bark of several species of tropical evergreens native to Asia. After the outer bark is scraped off the harvested branches, the inner bark is removed in sections that tend to curl into sticks as they dry. Bark that does not curl properly is made into ground cinnamon.
 Nutmeg comes from the seed of a tropical evergreen tree native to Indonesia’s Molucca Archipelago, also known as the Spice Islands.
 While nutmeg comes from the egg-shaped seed, mace is derived from the seed’s dried, lacy covering. Most consider nutmeg the sweeter of the two, but mace is regarded to have a more delicate flavor.
 The Moluccas also are the original source of clove, the dried flower bud of a tree in the myrtle family. “’Clove’ comes from the Latin ‘clavis,’ which means nail, and is descriptive of its shape,” Trinklein said.
 Clove and nutmeg were among 16th and 17th century Europe’s most precious commodities, worth more than their weight in gold.

The Forsyth County Chamber of Commerce held the 2020 Forward Forsyth Economic Development Summit virtually on Tuesday, Nov. 17, inviting county officials and education leaders to speak about Forward Forsyth and how the partnership has benefitted the county this year.
 Forward Forsyth is a partnership between the Forsyth County Government, Forsyth County Development Authority, Lanier Technical College, Forsyth County Schools, Forsyth County Chamber of Commerce and the University of North Georgia.
 The agencies and institutions work together to better Forsyth County’s economic development and plan for the community’s future.
 “Forward Forsyth leverages the time and talent of stakeholders from the business community, county government and local schools and colleges to develop and execute strategies and programs to attract investment and jobs to the community,” said Tim McDonald, the executive vice president of Lanier Tech. “The partnership is committed to bringing balance to the tax digest, improving quality of life and ensuring greater stability for the future, hence Forward Forsyth’s tagline of ‘Together, success.’”
 McDonald noted that the annual summit is an opportunity to show the community and local business owners some of the progress that leaders have made in their strategic economic development plan in the county.
 Carter Patterson, the chair of the Forsyth County Chamber of Commerce Board of Directors, started off the live streamed event, speaking to Forsyth County’s success in being the first in Georgia to launch an economic recovery initiative this year in light of the novel coronavirus pandemic.
 The initiative, Together 4 FoCo, has provided support to local business owners during a time of crisis, providing them with business expertise and access to working capital. As part of the initiative, Forsyth County leaders also strongly encouraged residents to support their local businesses whenever they could, and Patterson said many businesses in the county definitely saw that extra support from the community this year.

A new-look Southern California team tips off the 2020-21 season on Wednesday, welcoming Cal Baptist to the Galen Center.
 The Trojans ended their 2019-20 campaign at their home venue, knocking off rival UCLA with a dramatic buzzer-beating 3-pointer from Jonah Mathews. That win marked three straight victories for USC, which built significant momentum before the COVID-19 pandemic ended the college basketball season.
 Mathews is gone. So, too, is post player Onyeka Okongwu, who was drafted No. 6 overall in last week's NBA draft. USC also replaces Nick Rakocevic, Daniel Utomi and Elijah Weaver from last year's 22-win lineup.
 The five combined to average 54.9 of USC's 70.3 points per game. Okongwu and Rakocevic were also the Trojans' leading rebounders, both averaging more than eight per game, and Mathews led the team in steals at 1.4 per game.
 Despite the overhauled roster, USC is picked to finish fifth in the preseason Pac-12 Conference poll, and the Trojans received a first-place vote. Credit an influx of new talent and a dash of returning contributors moving into more prominent roles.
 USC returns last season's assists leader, guard Ethan Anderson. He will share the backcourt with Santa Clara transfer Tahj Eaddy, one of three high-profile transfers the Trojans added from mid-major programs. Another is Drew Peterson, a versatile, 6-foot-8 wing who received NCAA clearance to play this season after his move from Rice.
 "He's just a good, all-around basketball player," Trojans coach Andy Enfield said of Peterson at USC media day. "He can fill in for virtually any spot on the floor, except center."
 Center is unlikely to be too much of a concern, though. USC welcomes 7-foot freshman Evan Mobley, a five-star recruit and brother of returning post player Isaiah Mobley. The two join Wofford transfer Chevez Goodwin and returner Max Agbonkpolo in the Trojans' frontcourt.
 "Over quarantine, I've been working out every day. I've gotten a lot stronger," Agbonkpolo said at media day.
 He also cited improved 3-point shooting and ball-handling, as he is likely to settle into a stretch-four role.
 Like USC, Cal Baptist tips off its season with an overhauled lineup. The Lancers -- entering their third year of Division I membership -- won 21 games and finished in second place in the Western Athletic Conference.
 However, the Lancers replace their top six scorers -- four of whom averaged 11 points per game or more.
 Transfers Elijah Thomas (Saint Mary's), Russell Barlow (TCU) and Gorjok Gak (Florida) fill some of the gaps. At 6-foot-10 and 6-11, Barlow and Gak give Cal Baptist a counter to USC's frontcourt size.
 The Lancers also return guard Ty Rowell, who averaged 8.1 points per game before an ACL tear sidelined him early into the 2019-20 season.
 "I'm back to 100 percent," Rowell said at WAC media day. "(The pandemic) actually helped me out. The season's pushed back a little bit, gave me a little more time to recover and get back to my routine."

Senior IAS officer Sanjay Prasad who had served in Ministry of Defence in the past was of the view that India was on course towards greater self-reliance in defence. Agreeing with what Air Marshal Rajkumar had stated, he said that India had achieved a lot towards self-reliance in naval and missile sectors. Underlining the significance of self-reliance he cited history of India’s occupation by foreign forces. He said that in the medieval times, foreign armies landed in India with light weight and better swords and better horses and therefore were successful in defeating Indian forces. He said that there was no need to be very pessimistic in respect of future of India’s defence sector and noted that greater self-reliance in defence sector would have a multiplier effect on economy and strategic strength of India. He praised the current Government of India for taking major steps towards self-reliance in defence sector. He added that no import policy in respect of many defence supplies would further boost its own manufacturing in the long term and lead the country towards resourcefulness. Summing up the debate, Lt Gen Sanjiv Langer thanked the speakers for bringing up a wide spectrum of issues during the debate. He expressed hope that the government would pay greater attention towards all the paraphernalia including the policies, setting up R&D facilities and finance etc required to make India self-sufficient in the defence sector.

Now a vaccine for the coronavirus is on the horizon, and Gov. Greg Abbott has said the state is ready to swiftly distribute doses to combat the pandemic, which has already claimed more than 20,000 lives in Texas and dealt the economy a severe blow. But health officials say tried and true distribution methods in Texas may be insufficient for coronavirus vaccines that require subzero transportation and storage temperatures and require people to come back for a second dose.

LANDOVER, Md.
 Top pick Joe Burrow was carted off with a left knee injury before Alex Smith rallied Washington past the Cincinnati Bengals 20-9 Sunday to keep his team in the thick of the NFC East race.
 Burrow, Cincinnati's franchise quarterback, was injured early in the third quarter when he was hit high and low by two Washington linemen after throwing a pass. His left leg bent awkwardly, and he couldn't put any weight on it, ending his day at 22-of-34 passing for 203 yards and a touchdown.
 His season appears over, too. Burrow tweeted: "Thanks for all the love. Can't get rid of me that easy. See ya next year."
 Burrow's departure allowed Smith and Washington (3-7) to take over and move a half-game back of Philadelphia for first place in the NFL's weakest division. Just after Burrow left, the 36-year-old Smith -- who broke his right tibia and fibula on the same field just over two years ago -- led a go-ahead, 55-yard scoring drive that ended with a 3-yard TD pass to Steven Sims.
 In his second start since that gruesome injury Nov. 18, 2018, Smith was 17 of 25 for 166 yards and had a pass intercepted after it was tipped late in the first half.
