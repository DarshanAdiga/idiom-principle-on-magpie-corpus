She explains that the show had a slow build from BBC3 to Amazon Prime and the Emmys and says the success of the show was down to word of mouth.

England cricketers can look forward to a "bridge to the outside" if their home international season goes ahead.
 Despite the coronavirus pandemic cutting short the start of their season by several months, the England and Wales Cricket Board remain confident they can stage three-Test series against both the West Indies and Pakistan, in addition to limited-overs internationals with Ireland and Australia, as they try to avoid a £380 million ($463 million) financial black hole.
 Matches will be played behind closed doors at two 'bio-secure' venues, likely to be grounds with hotels such as Hampshire's Ageas Bowl and Lancashire's Old Trafford.
 No more than 250 people will be present, with everyone subjected to testing.
 Meanwhile another ground will be made available for training.
 There had been suggestions players might be cooped up together for more than two months in a secure 'bubble' to stop the spread of COVID-19.
 But it looks as if they will be allowed to spend some time with their families too, meaning England captain Joe Root could leave to attend the birth of his second child, due in July, if that happened when he was on international duty.
 "This is what they're calling, I think, the bridge to the outside," the ECB's director of special projects, Steve Elworthy, told a conference call on Friday.
 "That protocol of moving in and out through that bridge is currently being worked at with the doctor.
 "Clearly, the more people you have in and out of the bubble, the weaker the bubble is.
 "But at the same time, there are going to be circumstances when people will need to leave. I absolutely get that.
 "We will make sure that the protocols around leaving the bubble and coming back into the bubble are the shortest period of time but in the most safe and secure way possible."
 \- 'Everything in place' -
 The West Indies series was originally scheduled for June but the ECB hope it can go ahead in July, subject to British government approval.
 "It's effectively government guidance and clearance for us to get the (overseas) team into the country -- that's the last little bit," said Elworthy.
 The former South Africa fast bowler, a key figure in the staging of last year's World Cup in England, added: "From a planning point of view we have got everything in place.
 "We're ready for it, but clearly we don't want to stray outside of government guidelines and government decision-making."
 Earlier on Friday, England named a huge 55-strong training group designed to cope with all eventualities.
 Asked what would happen if a player tested positive for the virus during a game, Elworthy said the match would not be abandoned.
 "He will be placed in isolation," said Elworthy, who added rules around for COVID-19 substitutes had still to be worked out by the International Cricket Council, the sport's global governing body.
 "The latest advice that I've got on this is that the medical team on site will make an assessment."

The main question right now is when we will see Superman again. It was recently revealed that Zack Snyder's Justice League, aka the Snyder Cut, will be released on HBO Max next year. Henry Cavill could return for some reshoots to help bring Snyder's original vision to life. Though previous reports have suggested the director won't be allowed to do any additional photography for the movie. _Man of Steel 2_ is said to be off the table for the time being. Instead, it's expected that Cavill will appear in other upcoming DC movies alongside his fellow heroes. _Aquaman 2_ , _The Flash_ , _Shazam 2_. These are all possibilities. This has been likened to how Mark Ruffalo's Hulk is utilized in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

The police pull Jacob in for questioning, and Jacob’s parents are again filled with confusion about _whether their son is a serial killer_. Andy then admits to his wife, Laurie (Dockery), that the evidence letting Jacob off the hook for murder was fabricated. And with Hope missing, he might’ve killed again.
 The peace Laurie found when the charges against Jacob were dropped is irreversibly disturbed. While driving, she asks her son to tell her the truth. Jacob, afraid of his mother’s gradual speeding on such a rainy day, says, “Fine, I killed him, OK? Whatever you want, just slow down, please.”
 This is what Laurie, and the audience, have been waiting to hear, and yet its validity is still in question. “It feels like a confession but, of course, it’s not,” said Bomback. “He just said it to get her to slow down. That’s the crux of the problem Laurie is facing: She’ll never, ever get the truth. It makes you empathize with Laurie, and the torture that causes her to snap.”
 Driving even faster now, Laurie says, “I will never know” over and over again — an improvised moment from Dockery in that soundstage, with the machine- created weather conditions and projected landscape moving at full force. “I loved it — you really feel that she’s unraveling,” recalled Tyldum.

Fans and critics alike have mixed feelings about the movies that Henry Cavill starred in as Clark Kent, but the consensus has always seemed to be that the actor, in terms of his look, was made to play the part. But Cavill is not a superhero born of Krypton. He is a man who has to put in a lot of work to get into shape for the part. Superman is buff. As we've seen in the past, Cavill isn't content to let a padded suit do the heavy-lifting.

FRISCO, Texas — Northwestern State pitcher Kyle Swanson is the 2020 Southland Conference Baseball Student-Athlete of the Year, the league announced Thursday when it released its all-academic teams in a prepared statement.
 The Student-Athlete of the Year awards are presented by GEICO.
 The Montgomery, Texas, native graduated with a perfect 4.00 GPA in health and human performance, earning his second degree in five years in Natchitoches. A CoSIDA Academic All-District selection, Swanson will return to the Lone Star State to become part of the inaugural class of Sam Houston State’s College of Osteopathic Medicine.
 Swanson owned a 1.04 ERA across seven appearances with four saves in 2020 prior to the season being cancelled due to COVID-19. His four saves ranked third in the conference and 17th nationally. Swanson tossed a 1-2-3 ninth inning in a win over Louisiana, the Demons’ first since 2011. His eight career saves place him in a tie for seventh in school history.
 Before the shutdown, Swanson was on pace to threaten the school’s single- season mark of 10 saves, held by Chad Sheppard (twice) and Daniel Desclouds.
 “Kyle has been the epitome of this award ever since he stepped on campus,” fourth-year Northwestern State head coach Bobby Barbier said in a statement. “The work ethic it takes to compete in the classroom as well as compete on the field is what makes Kyle receiving this award so special. I’m very proud of Kyle and all he has done for our school.”
 Swanson carried a 4.0 GPA into his final semester of graduate school and completed his master’s degree in health and human performance with a concentration in health promotion in May. He has been accepted into the first class of Sam Houston State University’s College of Osteopathic Medicine, beginning in the fall of 2020.
 Swanson joins Cort Brinson (2015) and Eric DeBlanc (2010) as Demons who have earned the SLC Baseball Student-Athlete of the Year designation.
 Northwestern State first baseman Peyton Davis, McNeese senior right fielder Clayton Rasbeary and Nicholls State senior right-handed pitcher Peter Holland also were named to the first team.
 Davi, a redshirt junior from Bossier City, batted .273 with a team-leading three home runs and 14 RBIs, which tied for the team lead, and was a magna cum laude graduate in business administration earlier this month. Davis carried a 3.83 grade point average into his final semester of undergraduate study.
 “Marshall and Peyton always have been great ambassadors for NSU,” Barbier said. “Their achievements and their inclusion on this team represent what we try to instill in all of our guys. I am very proud of their leadership in our program.”
 Rasbeary, a junior transfer last season, will be returning to McNeese next year for a do-over of his senior year after the NCAA granted all seniors the opportunity to return for another season.
 In just over a complete season, Rasbeary showed his raw power at the plate over the last two seasons. As of the close of the 2020 baseball season, Rasbeary leads the team with 14 home runs and 69 RBIs, along with 17 doubles and 2 triples.
 The outfielder graduated this month with his bachelor’s degree in criminal justice, compiling a 3.60 grade point average.
 The dynamic duo each served as vital contributors during the shortened 18-game season, as Holland quickly emerged as the first out of the bullpen for the Red & Gray while Simon clicked both at the plate and on the baselines, all while maintaining a 3.91 GPA in biology and 3.92 mark in business administration, respectively.
 Holland, who picked up his first-ever recognition on the league’s all-academic teams, registered a competitive year on the mound, tossing 11 1/3 innings in relief across a team-high nine appearances. The Gulfport, Mississippi, native finished with a 1-0 record along with a 2.38 ERA, setting down 14 batters on strikes while posting a squad-second best .200 opposing batting average.
 Simon, meanwhile, managed a return appearance to the SLC all-academic squads following last year’s automatic selection due to CoSIDA All-District honors. The Destrehan local ranked first conference-wide in both hit-by-pitch (8) and stolen bases (9) while also leading the Colonels in total walks (15), not to mention notching second for the Red & Gray in on-base percentage (.449) and runs scored (10).
 Northwestern State senior catcher Marshall Skinner, UNO senior Beau Bratton, Nicholls State junior outfielder Dane Simon and Southeastern Louisiana’s Nick Ray and Will Warren were second-team picks.
 “Dane and Peter are very deserving of this honor,” head baseball coach Seth Thibodeaux said. “We certainly aren’t shocked. A ton of hard work goes in to this. These guys put in the hours to be the best and I’m proud that they are being honored for it. It’s speaks volumes about them. Congrats to both.”

NEWPORT -- As an EMT in Swansea, Massachusetts, Naval Undersea Warfare Center Division Newport electrical engineer Gary Huntress at times has to respond to difficult situations.
   
 A recent call, though, was different from anything he had experienced before in light of the coronavirus pandemic.
   
 "I transported a gentleman recently and his wife -- probably in her 80s -- looked half at me and half distantly saying, 'I know I can't go with him.' That made me very sad," Huntress said. "Usually, she would ride with us in the ambulance so she could be with him in the hospital.
   
 "The threat is unseen and you don't know how protective you need to be. You worry that you need to do more and that's stressful."
   
 Huntress, like all people throughout the world, has had to adapt to new threats posed by the coronavirus. Unlike others, he has seen how gut-wrenching this can be firsthand.
   
 "I have been to the triage tent at Rhode Island Hospital and brought patients to the COVID-19 isolation ward. It's not pretty," Huntress said. "Let's all keep fighting this."
   
 Huntress, a resident of Swansea and a member of the town's Ambulance Corps' Board of Directors, works as an EMT every Friday from 6 p.m. through Saturday at 6 a.m. and often fills in other shifts when needed. At NUWC Division Newport, Huntress works in the Software Engineering Branch in the Platform and Payload Integration Department.
   
 "We have gone from zero cases in our region to a handful, but before our first reported case we were already treating everyone as high risk," Huntress said. "All local ambulance services have been preparing for this for many weeks. We have dramatically changed how we respond to almost every call.
   
 "In the past, we'd arrive on scene and the crew (typically three of us) would meet the patient in place and immediately begin treatment. Today, the 911 dispatcher tells the patient to meet us outside if possible. That would have been unthinkable in the past."
   
 Huntress also described their disinfection procedures as "extreme." At the start of each shift and after every patient, he said, the inside of the ambulance -- cab and box -- is cleaned with a bleach solution.
   
 "Every piece of equipment we use or touch is cleaned. We have gloves, gowns, goggles, masks and face shields," Huntress said. "Thankfully, we have adequate supplies and all crews take this very seriously."
   
 Huntress praised Division Newport leadership for the measures it has taken to ensure worker safety.
   
 "Bravo Zulu for sure. Embracing telework early was the correct move, especially knowing it would not be perfect at first. Then working hard to fix what wasn't working was also excellent," Huntress said. "My telework experience has been very good and I'm trying hard to be productive.
   
 "I have not been at my office in quite a while, but they rolled out lots of hand sanitizer and wipes, and most importantly good communication and awareness. I honestly think that has reduced our exposure."
   
 Like Division Newport leadership, Huntress echoes much of the same advice as the Center for Disease Control for preventing spread of the virus. This includes washing your hands thoroughly and often, refraining from touching your face, staying home when you can and maintaining at least 6 feet of physical distance when you must leave your house.
