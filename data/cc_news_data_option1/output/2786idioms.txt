Striking while the market's hot, Airstream grows its small, shiny adventure trailer family with the new Basecamp 20 and 20X models. As their names give away, the new trailers stretch an even 20 feet (6-m) in length, growing 25 percent over the original Basecamp series, now the Basecamp 16. This takes the Basecamp from couples' trailer to family trailer, sleeping four people behind the expansive panoramic views afforded by the wraparound windows. It's not a bad way to live the Airstream life.
 Airstream trailers have always been an American design icon, universally adored for that unmistakable "silver bullet" style. For some admirers, though, stretched, 5,000-lb (2,270-kg) towable fuselages rising into six-figure pricing territory will never amount to more than artwork enjoyed from afar. Some such admirers — youthful, adventurous souls — crave something smaller, simpler and more outdoorsy, trailers to negotiate tight, dusty switchbacks as effectively as six-lane highways.
 Airstream found itself chasing that very type of potential buyer when it introduced the Basecamp in 2016. Something of an ace in the hole, the Basecamp was a decade-old design by that point, dating back to a collaborative 2005 concept project developed with Nissan. The original Basecamp enjoyed the rare distinction of growing more handsome in moving from concept to production model (in our opinion, at least) and went on to begin a short market run in the pre-recession days of 2007, before ultimately proving ahead of its time. It was sidelined until throngs of wanderlust-filled millennials driving small, efficient cars and crossovers began clamoring for something just like it years later. Its timeless style was as fresh in 2016 as in 2005, requiring but some modest updates.

Wallace had race-ending contact with the wall when his No. 43 Chevrolet appeared to be turned from behind by Michael McDowell 17 laps into the first stage. He said he didn’t need to see a replay because he knew McDowell’s contact was egregious.
 “Just disrespect. When you get hooked into the wall, I don’t even need to see a replay,” Wallace said. "People say he’s one of the nicest guys in the garage. I can’t wait for the God-fearing text that he is going to send me about preaching and praise and respect. What a joke he is.”
 A piece of Wallace’s crumpled sheet metal was placed on the back of McDowell’s team truck and Wallace was seen walking away.
 Wallace climbed from his car and gave a thumbs-up to a contingent of fans cheering for him. Roughly two dozen organizers from Justice 4 the Next Generation traveled from Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina and Virginia in an effort to diversify NASCAR.
 Wallace is the only Black driver competing regularly in NASCAR's top series, and drivers rallied around him after a noose was found at his assigned stall at Talladega Superspeedway in Atlanta. Federal authorities ruled last month the noose had been hanging since October and was not a hate crime.
 NASCAR and Speedway Motorsports were allowed to sell 30,000 tickets to the All-Star race, which was moved from Charlotte Motor Speedway for just the second time in the event's history. North Carolina, where the race was held at Charlotte its first year in 1985 and every year since 1987, would not authorize spectators for the race.
 Bristol, dubbed “The Last Great Colosseum,” can hold about 140,000 spectators. Speedway Motorsports had those in attendance socially distanced through the grandstands and masks were only required upon entrance. Fans were told they could remove them once in their seats.
 “You hate to lean on them (the fans), but it damn sure feels good to have the fans back at the track. Thank you, guys!” Bowyer said. “You want to talk about an All-Star event, this is the right track to do it.”

However, I wish with all might that the story progression of Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla brings out all the intensity of a game on viking warfare in the medieval era. Personally, I wish the gameplay trailer featured darker, more intense clips from various segments, and given a few more clues as to what the storyline would represent. Without this, it all seems to be a bit quiet right now – far too much like any other game, and that, we all know, is _not_ why we play Assassin’s Creed for. Here’s hoping that like the initial teaser, Valhalla has much more to talk about than just being another Assassin title.

Lacking much guidance from Washington, where President Donald Trump has from the start resisted virus-related closures, individual parks and local health officials devised their own strategies on the fly. Grand Canyon initially shut down on April 1.
 The park partially reopened in time for summer tourist season. But now infections are surging in the states that host the nation’s most-visited natural wonders, and the country’s 62 national parks are struggling with how to safely allow visitors while preventing outbreaks. With Trump, who called for parks to reopen in late April, still urging swift reopenings of schools and other businesses, public health officials and park rangers worry that it could prove difficult to close the parks again if necessary.
 The country’s parks were surging with popularity even before the pandemic shuttered Americans in their homes. Last year, the National Park Service logged 327.5 million visitors, the third-largest annual crowd behind those in 2016 and 2017.
 While attendance has fallen in many parks because of the shutdowns — Grand Canyon officials estimate that its daily number of visitors could be cut in half — many people are still making the trip. At Cades Cove, a popular section of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park in Tennessee, weekend visitation in May was 54% higher than the same month last year even though the park was closed for some of that time.
 In some ways, the parks provide a refuge from the pandemic. Experts say the risk of catching the virus is much lower outdoors. Camping offers a cheap, socially distanced vacation for families, and some parks are in sparsely populated areas with fewer cases.
 But as the virus infiltrates growing sections of the country, some lawmakers are questioning the decision to keep parks open even partially.
 “I felt all along that the public health rationale for closing these places, which was obvious to everyone, was overridden by the symbolic need to have something open,” said Rep. Raúl Grijalva, D-Ariz., chair of the House Natural Resources Committee.
 On May 15, Grijalva, on behalf of the committee, sent the Interior Department a detailed request for the safety criteria it would apply to reopening national parks. The Interior Department replied two weeks later, calling the committee’s request “overly broad and unreasonably burdensome, particularly at this time.”
 “It’s the same situation in all the parks,” Grijalva said. “The administration trying to shoehorn political and economic considerations into its decisions, and the public health taking a back seat to those discussions.”
 In a statement, the National Park Service defended parks’ decision to remain mostly open. “With the support of Department of the Interior and National Park Service leadership, park superintendents are making decisions to modify operations for facilities and programs based on federal and state public health guidance.”
 Parks have revised operations to better protect visitors and people living in adjacent communities. In Utah, Zion National Park is reducing visitors with a first-come, first-served ticketing system. In California, Yosemite National Park is taking limited reservations. Grand Canyon has closed some entrances, shops and visitors’ centers, and restricted Colorado River trips to protect hard-hit Native American communities nearby.
 Still, crowds inevitably gather. On a visit to Yellowstone National Park last month, Lynn Bacon, 61, a biologist from Bozeman, Montana, was surprised to see hundreds of people clustered together waiting for Old Faithful, the park’s most famous and punctual geyser, to erupt.
 “We were being cautious because everybody is there: Texas, Floridians, California, Wisconsin,” said Bacon, recalling the out-of-state license plates she saw. She estimated that 1% of the visitors she saw were wearing masks.
 “It probably feels to many people that it’s a safe haven here,” she said. But “people are bringing it here,” she added.

There's no assurance the Texas Tech football team will get to play a 12-game regular season this fall with the coronavirus pandemic having not subsided.
   
 But Tech athletics director Kirby Hocutt and deputy AD Tony Hernandez are going to keep planning for a full schedule until it's no longer possible.
   
 Tech officials have talked to counterparts from eight other schools, two in power-five conferences, about coming to Jones AT&T; Stadium on Sept. 19. The Tech-Arizona game set for that date in Lubbock was canceled last week when the Pac-12 announced its schools will play conference-only competition this fall.
   
 Tech senior associate AD Robert Giovannetti declined to name the eight schools with whom Tech has had conversations, other than identifying two as from the power-five. He said Tech strongly prefers to replace the lost Sept. 19 home game with another Sept. 19 home game rather than go on the road or try to rearrange the schedule to make another date work.
   
 Texas A&M; lost a Sept. 19 home game against Colorado due to the Pac-12's decision, prompting fan speculation about the possibility of a Tech-A&M; football game for the first time since the Aggies left the Big 12 after the 2011 season.
   
 "I think both schools are open to it, but I don't expect it to happen," Giovannetti said. "Both schools, I think, are looking for a home game on Sept. 19, so that's why I don't expect it to happen."
   
 The Big Ten last Thursday announced its teams will play conference-only schedules, delaying the start of their seasons during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Pac-12 voted Friday to do the same.
   
 The Big 12 hasn't made a decision.
   
 The Dallas Morning News, after a Big 12 ADs meeting on Tuesday, quoted Big 12 commissioner Bob Bowlsby as saying, "We're going to have to be patient and continue to read the tea leaves and see what the next two or three or four weeks bring us."
   
 Tech also could fill the hole on the schedule with a second game against an FCS opponent. The NCAA Division I Council announced Wednesday that teams can count two victories over qualifying FCS programs toward bowl eligibility this season.
   
 Tech's remaining non-conference games are against Texas-El Paso from the group of five and Alabama State from the FCS.
   
 Thompson makes list
   
 SaRodorick Thompson enjoyed a breakout season in 2019, and now the Texas Tech running back will go into the 2020 season as a proven performer.
   
 The Red Raiders' 6-foot, 210-pound sophomore is one of 76 players on the preseason watch list for the Doak Walker Award, which is presented annually to the top running back in college football.
   
 The Carrollton Ranchview product carried 160 times for 765 yards and 12 touchdowns last season, the touchdowns total ranking third in the Big 12.
   
 If there is a season this fall amid the coronavirus pandemic, the Doak Walker Award field will be narrowed to 10 semifinalists in November and then to three finalists. The winner will be announced Dec. 10 at the annual college football awards show on ESPN.
   
 Thompson was among a handful of returning skill-position players for whom Tech announced jersey number changes this week. He will switch from No. 28 to No. 4.
   
 Receiver Seth Collins is changing from No. 22 to No. 0, receiver McLane Mannix from No. 13 to No. 11, and receiver Erik Ezukanma from No. 84 to No. 13.
   
 Waiver approved
   
 Tech newcomer Brandon Bouyer-Randle has officially received an extension waiver from the NCAA, a Tech spokesman said Wednesday, restoring the eligibility he used during an injury-shortened season last year.
   
 The development, not unexpected, makes Bouyer-Randle a junior again.
   
 Bouyer-Randle is a 6-2, 230-pound linebacker who joined the Red Raiders in January as a graduate transfer from Michigan State. He played in four games last season.
   
 Under a rule that went into effect before the 2019 season, players can play in up to four games in a season while maintaining redshirt status, but Bouyer- Randle already had redshirted in 2016.
   
 The waiver extends his eligibility clock through the spring of 2022, allowing him to play the 2020 and 2021 seasons.
   
 Duffey landing spot
   
 Former Tech quarterback Jett Duffey enrolled last week as a graduate transfer at Hampton, according to a report by 247Sports.
   
 Hampton, located in Hampton, Virginia, is an FCS football program that competes in the Big South Conference.
   
 On Monday, Hampton athletics director Eugene Marshall Jr. announced the university is suspending competition in all fall sports.
   
 Duffey was Tech's primary quarterback throughout Big 12 play last season, throwing for 2,840 yards and 18 touchdowns with five interceptions. Since leaving the program, he has been denied admission at Tulane and Central Michigan.
   
 Numerals to know
   
 Texas Tech on Wednesday published jersey numbers for its scholarship newcomers on social media. Quarterback Donovan Smith will wear No. 7, running back Chadarius Townsend will be No. 5, and running back Tahj Brooks will take No. 28.
   
 Among receivers, Myles Price will wear No. 18, Loic Fouonji No. 19 and J.J. Sparkman No. 84. Tight ends Jason Lloyd and John Holcomb will sport No. 26 and No. 87, respectively.
   
 Among offensive linemen, Josh Burger will wear No. 50, Larry Moore No. 75 and Caleb Rogers No. 76. Defensive lineman Philip Blidi will be No. 96.
   
 Among linebackers, Krishon Merriweather will take No. 1, Jacob Morgenstern No. 41, Derrick Lewis No. 48 and L.B. Moore No. 92.
   
 Among defensive backs, Cam White will be No. 10, Eric Monroe No. 11, Cameron Watts No. 21, Nate Floyd No. 29, Kobee Minor No. 30, Ryan Frank No. 43 and Jonathan "Jon-Jon" Davis No. 46.

BRISTOL, Tenn. (AP) — Clint Bowyer hopped off his pit stand at Bristol Motor Speedway to learn he'd won the fan vote to advance into NASCAR's All-Star race — an announcement met by a roar from the grandstands.It wasn't the raucous ovation typically heard in Thunder Valley, but after four months of near silence, it was better than nothing.Up to 30,000 fans were allowed to attend Wednesday night’s race, NASCAR’s largest with spectators since the coronavirus pandemic shut down sports in March. Attendance figures were not released, but it appeared at least 20,000 spectators were socially distanced throughout the grandstands — likely making it the largest sporting event in the United States since winter.“It damn sure feels good to have the fans back at the track,” Bowyer said.IndyCar raced last weekend at Road America in Wisconsin and there was no limit on tickets sold to the event held on a 4-mile road course. Crowd estimates for that event have been around 10,000 spectators.Driver introductions were held for the first time since racing resumed May 17, although the usual over-the-top festivities were toned down. Drivers for the All-Star event typically walked out on a stage with their team but on Wednesday night they stood next to their cars and waved to the crowd as they were introduced.The All-Star Race was moved from Charlotte Motor Speedway for just the second time since its 1985 inception because Tennessee officials allowed Speedway Motorsports to sell a percentage of its seats. North Carolina, where the race was held at Charlotte Motor Speedway its first year and every year since 1987, would not authorize spectators.Bristol, dubbed “The Last Great Colosseum,” can hold about 140,000 people, meaning it would be 79% empty even with a sellout crowd of 30,000. Masks were only required upon entrance. Fans were told they could remove them once in their seats.Tickets were on sale through Tuesday evening and still available on Bristol’s website until the deadline. The speedway is privately owned and attendance figures are not required to be released.Concession stands were open, but typical shopping opportunities were limited and independent street-side souvenir stands along Speedway Boulevard hawked driver items and even a few Confederate flags.As fans arrived, they were greeted by a plane flying over the Tennessee track that was pulling a banner of the Confederate flag.NASCAR in June banned the flag at its events, but protesters at Talladega Superspeedway in Alabama paraded past the main entrance waving them from their vehicles. A plane also flew over the speedway that day with a flag that read “Defund NASCAR,” a play on the “defund the police” slogan of some protesting racial injustice.President Donald Trump has criticized NASCAR for banning the Confederate flag, blaming the decision for the sport’s “low ratings,” although TV ratings for NASCAR have been up since racing resumed.The Sons of Confederate Veterans of Columbia, Tennessee, claimed it had paid for the banner over Talladega. The one flying over Bristol Motor Speedway listed only the group’s website.Copyright 2020 Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Alabama's governor, who leads one of the country's most conservative states, on Wednesday said people would be obligated to wear masks when leaving the house. The announcement, which came as Alabama recorded a new single-day novel coronavirus death record, means nearly half of all states now have a mandate.
 The world's largest retailer and a staple of rural communities nationwide, Walmart Inc., issued the same requirement for shoppers in its stores. A powerful trade group quickly embraced the choice, raising the prospect that other major chains will soon follow.
 "Shopping in a store is a privilege, not a right," said the National Retail Federation. "If a customer refuses to adhere to store policies, they are putting employees and other customers at undue risk."
 The moves came only hours after Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, declared that coronavirus outbreaks — now raging across much of the country — could be "under control" within one or two months if the public adopts widespread mask use.
 So far, that hasn't happened — despite a toll that on Wednesday topped 134,000 deaths and hit nearly 3.5 million cases. Health experts say that if masks aren't more routinely used, governors will have little choice but to continue rolling back economic reopenings as cases surge.
 Trump has led the charge in casting doubt on mask use, mocking those who don one and refusing for months to wear one in public. He has recently endorsed their use, but only grudgingly, and late last week wore one in public for the first time.
 Trump's contempt has been emulated by rank-and-file Republicans, who polls show are significantly less likely than Democrats or independents to wear masks, as well as by GOP officeholders.
 One such official, Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, on Wednesday became the first state chief executive to announce that he has tested positive for the coronavirus. Just over three weeks ago, Stitt appeared unmasked at a Trump rally in Tulsa, where the president joined thousands of others in dispensing with face coverings.
 Stitt said he felt "fine" and would be isolating. The governor, who urged residents to flock to restaurants early in the outbreak even as other state leaders were shutting down, said he did not believe he had contracted the virus at Trump's rally.
 The news came as Oklahoma reported more than 1,000 new coronavirus cases — a single-day record as the average number of new deaths also increases.
 In Florida, which has the dubious distinction of leading the nation with an average of more than 10,000 cases a day over the past week, hospital officials said they had seen a spike in COVID-19 patients that caught them off-guard.
 Carlos Migoya, president and CEO of Miami's Jackson Health System, Florida's largest hospital group, told CNN on Wednesday that the number of patients with COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, jumped from 129 on June 14 to 420 patients on July 14.
 One of the main culprits, he said: resistance to wearing a mask.
 "The biggest issue is that we have a lot of aggressive noncompliant people, people that just do not believe that masking is the right thing to do," Migoya said. "A lot of the young people are saying, 'So what if I get it? If I get it, it doesn't mean anything.' "
 The evidence that masks are effective in stopping the spread of the coronavirus has existed nearly as long as the virus itself has. But the messaging about whether the public should wear them has often been muddled.
 Early on, the country's top scientific and medical officials warned against them.
 "Seriously people- STOP BUYING MASKS!" U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams tweeted in late February as the coronavirus was beginning to circulate in communities across the country. "They are NOT effective in preventing general public from catching #Coronavirus."

Another of the F-35's missiles is the Raytheon AIM-9X Sidewinder, a shorter- range air-to-air missile that uses infrared instead of radar to detect, track and guide to a target. That helps the plane stay stealthy; fighter jets typically can sense when they're being targeted by radar, and when they do, they alert their pilots. But with infrared targeting, there's no such warning.

Another lesson Shankar learned was to be patient in a crisis. “Sometimes it is better to wait and not rush. As the saying goes, ‘the early bird gets the worm, but the second mouse gets the cheese.’ It’s sometimes just better to wait and be cautious because you don’t know in a situation like this, where the bottom is,” he said.

One of my guilty pleasures is watching TV shows just to see how people's haircuts are holding up without the benefit of their regular stylists. The ladies of "The View," for instance, are particularly fascinating. Some -- who apparently have a hairdresser in the family or a secret degree in cosmetology -- are holding up well. Others look a little rough. I won't name names, but check it out for yourself.
