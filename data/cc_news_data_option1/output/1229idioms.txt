President Donald Trump can’t tour the hospitals where the afflicted are kept alive through the relentless professionalism of health care workers. He cannot rally crowds at a time when keeping our distance from one another. And, though he’s not a “touchy feely” president, he can’t get close to the families of those who have lost a loved one if he wanted to.
 What he can do is what he is scheduled to do today: Come to Norfolk to see off the USNS Comfort, a Navy hospital ship that will head to New York to provide needed capacity for those sickened by this terrible virus.
 Predictably there are those who believe the president shouldn’t come, that he should stay in Washington to work on coordinating the response, locating needed equipment, marshaling available resources and urging the public to stay the course on social distancing.
 But one hopes it provides some measure of reassurance and support to those who will staff the ship and who are being asked to risk their lives in the service of others to see their commander in chief at this pivotal moment.
 As the president wishes them godspeed and a safe return, he does so for us all.
 ##  Be wary of scams
 The massive federal spending bill that worked its way through Congress this week runs hundreds of pages and includes a great many initiatives aimed at helping the medical professionals fighting this virus on the frontlines, workers who have been affected by the economic slowdown and businesses shuttered as a result of government orders.
 The details of those provisions are not widely known, which criminals have already seized as an opportunity to fraud and theft.
 On Friday, Attorney General Mark Herring issued a consumer alert warning Virginians that scammers are already trying to swindle the public, using the stimulus package as bait. These deviants may try to solicit bank account information, claiming it is a necessary part of receiving money from the government.

The threat of COVID-19 has forced officials to scale back the Sebastian County jail population to almost three-fourths its bed capacity using measures the sheriff says may prove beneficial once the pandemic is over.
 The Sebastian County Adult Detention Center on Wednesday had a population of around 270 -- around 76% of its bed count of 356. The dip in detainee population is a combination of collaboration between law enforcement agencies, electronic monitoring of released detainees, a more proactive approach to their signature bond protocol, and more space in prisons for convicted detainees waiting for transport, said County Sheriff Hobe Runion.
 "You've always heard, 'Lock up those we're afraid of, not those we're mad at,' and I think this is forcing us to be more efficient in that," Runion said.
 COVID-19, the potentially deadly disease caused by the novel coronavirus, spreads through respiratory droplets produced from a sneeze or cough from an infected person. This happens most easily when people are within 6 feet of each other, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
 The Detention Center in recent years has suffered overcrowding, including more than 500 detainees in 2017. County Circuit Judge Stephen Tabor on March 17 expressed concern about how cutbacks on court functions such as sentencing hearings in response to the virus could affect the jail.
 In response to the virus itself, Runion and other county officials have worked for two weeks to create space for people who need to be quarantined in two jail pods. He said these two pods have "negative air," which means nothing can spread to the rest of the facility from the pods.
 "We're planning for the worst," Runion said. "What happens if we have 25 people who have symptoms and we have to quarantine them all?"
 To do this, sheriff's officials have had to find ways to lower the detainee count to similar numbers as those seen Wednesday. This has required jail officials to put qualifying detainees on electronic monitoring or bond reduction, Runion said. He also said he's had to recommend detainees who qualify for signature bond but also have petition to revoke bond warrants to the prosecutor's office and judges for release.
 In addition to these measures, Runion also said the Arkansas Department of Corrections has cleared more space in their prisons, which has allowed them to release state convicts awaiting prison from the jail. He also said more detainees have been bonding out of jail in general during the outbreak.
 "Their families are saying, 'Hey, let's get them out.' They're working with the prosecutor and the judges, and on occasion, they can have a reduced bond," Runion said.
 Sheriff's officials have also taken practical measures such as cleaning the jail more thoroughly. Anyone who enters the jail also has his or her temperature taken, Runion said.
 All of these measures are for detainees such as the only one who was booked into the jail with a fever since the outbreak restrictions began. Runion said the detainee was quarantined in the jail because his charges didn't qualify him for release.
 Detainees with violent or sex charges won't be considered for release, Runion said.
 "The reality is that some people are going to go into quarantine, because just because someone has COVID-19 doesn't mean we can release them," he said.
 Having said that, Runion said he plans to release everyone he can who is safe to release during the pandemic.
 Outside the jail, officials are finding ways to work more efficiently at every level, Runion said. He said judges are now using video arraignments for juvenile detainees, which lowers detainee transport. The judges have said they could keep changes such as these after the COVID-19 restrictions are lifted, Runion said.
 Runion believes these measures could help the county criminal justice system in the long run.
 "We're learning the hard way because we're being forced to learn, at this point, to run more efficiently," he said.
