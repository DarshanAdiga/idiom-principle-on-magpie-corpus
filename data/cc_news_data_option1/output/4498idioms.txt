No PlansSpokesmen for GM and Fiat Chrysler said they have no plans to return to monthly sales reporting.Sales of Ford’s F-Series pickup line slid 4% to 71,593 units in October after the automaker had its best third quarter for pickup sales in 15 years. Ford sold almost 900,000 F-Series trucks last year, but it’s overhauling the top money maker to catch up to recently revamped versions of Fiat Chrysler’s Ram and GM’s Chevrolet Silverado.While overall F-Series sales declined last month, retail deliveries to individual customers rose 1.5%, Deep said.Chief Financial Officer John Lawler told investors last month Ford would lose 100,000 unit sales of the F-150 in the fourth quarter as it converts a factory near Kansas City to produce the redesigned model.Key ReasonThat’s a key reason Ford said it will break even or earn as much as $500 million before interest and taxes in the final three months of the year, down from $3.6 billion in the third quarter. The automaker said the launch of the new F-150, which also includes converting a factory in Dearborn, Michigan, is going smoothly.“We’re a long way from declaring victory,” Jim Farley, Ford’s new chief executive officer, said on an October 28 earnings call with investors. “But we’ve worked through the launch so far. We’ve made a lot of progress as a team and now we’re into mass production.”Ford’s truck sales dropped 7.4%, pulled down by a 26% decline in deliveries of commercial Transit vans. Its sport-utility vehicle sales rose 9.4% as Explorer sales jumped 20% compared with a year ago when a botched launch hampered production.Ford’s car sales plunged 45%, as it continues to exit the sedan market in the US to focus on more profitable trucks and SUVs.The Lincoln luxury line sold 2.8% more vehicles in October than a year earlier, propelled by a 37% rise in deliveries of its small Corsair SUV.",

The winner of the election is determined through a system called the Electoral College. Each of the 50 states, plus Washington DC, is given a number of Electoral College votes, adding up to a total of 538 votes. More populous states get more Electoral College votes than smaller ones. A candidate needs to win 270 Electoral College votes (50% plus one) to win the election.

_So how does Joe Biden convince some of those people, even if he wins, even if he wins in particular, of course, but also if he 's running, how does he convince those people to get on board and to not be afraid of what is going to be a changing America? The second thing I think that's going to be a big challenge is the actual process of voting. There are so many people who are already trying to vote, who are already saying their vote is trying to be suppressed. Republicans based on the courts have learned how to, um, target people with surgical African-Americans in particular with surgical precision one judge said in North Carolina, so Republicans are better at suppressing the vote and that's not, I don't think that's an opinion.

An example of the government's confusing orders was recently illustrated, he said, by Quebec's second opposition party, Quebec solidaire. The party said it didn't understand why a pork-processing plant where more than 100 workers contracted COVID-19 is still operating but the province's COVID-free cinemas are shut.
 During the first wave of the pandemic, Quebec issued more fines than any other province, followed by Ontario and Nova Scotia, Luscombe said. Quebec is also the province hardest-hit by the novel coronavirus, reporting significantly more infections and deaths than any other part of the country.
 Other provinces, such as British Columbia, which made little use of fines during the first wave, are now issuing more fines in an attempt to ensure compliance, Luscombe said. "There's been a lot more places using this approach."
 On Wednesday, the province's deputy premier, Genevieve Guilbault, threatened to fine restaurant owners who defy partial lockdown orders. Her comments came after two restaurants in the Saguenay region said they planned to reopen Friday. Saguenay was placed under Quebec's highest COVID-19 alert level Monday, which forced the region's restaurant dining areas, bars, gyms and entertainment venues to close.
 Guilbault told reporters if restaurant owners choose to open, the government will be prepared -- last week it adopted a decree allowing police to fine customers found in businesses that had been ordered closed. The decree followed an announcement by some gym owners who said they would defy orders and reopen. But most owners changed their minds and stayed closed.
 Luscombe said the gyms owners' change of heart is not necessarily a sign that fines are working to deter people. "I think there are too many factors at play in that situation to draw the conclusion that the threat of fines alone led to the gym owners backing down," he said.
 Even if it was the threats of fines that made gym owners relent, "it doesn't necessarily follow that fines will work in other contexts like deterring large parties or getting people to wear masks in public," Luscombe said.

 Inslee, who briefly ran for president last year, has been a frequent critic of Republican President Donald Trump, especially his handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Culp, police chief of the small town of Republic, campaigned in part against Inslee’s coronavirus restrictions like mandatory masks, saying they infringe on people’s constitutional rights.
 In initial results posted by the state's 39 counties, Inslee had about 60% of the vote.

Since Christman says he needs the position filled, the Legislature’s Personnel Committee has approved a post with pay suitable to the duties currently being performed by his daughter. They also approved a short-term extension for his daughter in order to fully train her replacement.
 “The issue for Mr. Christman at this time rests solely with his desire to keep his daughter employed in his office against our Employment of Relatives Policy,” Crandall said. “He has been given the ability to hire a member of our community who desires some temporary work. Whether or not Mr. Christman exercises that ability is completely under his control.”
 He noted that the position supplies Bridget Christman with benefits including paid time off and health insurance that were never intended to apply to a temporary position in the DMV office.
 The Personnel Committee is even moving forward with eliminating an exception in the county’s policy, Crandall said.
 The Legislature approved Rob Christman’s request that he hire his daughter temporarily under the exception to the policy.
 “All of a sudden they started saying they’re not comfortable with this,” he told The Evening Tribune of Hornell last week. “I’m in the middle of a tsunami, in the middle of a pandemic. I understand the concerns, but I’m trying to open up the DMV to the public. I have a trained individual.”
 Legislator Karl Graves was the lone county lawmaker willing to vote for extending the exception for Bridget Christman given the constraints of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Ant and other private sector, consumer-oriented online finance platforms are making inroads into an industry dominated by state-owned banks that were set up to support government companies, not serve the public.
 Ant needs to improve management in some areas to match traditional businesses, said Guo Tianyong, a banking specialist at the Central University of Finance and Economics in Beijing.
 “They’re similar to a bank’s credit card business, but internal management isn’t as good as banks,” said Guo. “Of course, we don’t question the quality of Ant Group. But the government must be sure that a company should be operating in compliance with regulation.”
 Ant and some others connect borrowers to state banks. But they also squeeze state institutions by allowing entrepreneurs and consumers to shop for higher deposit rates or lower-priced services.
 Ant has been “taking away market share from the commercial banks,” said Francis Lun, CEO of Geo Securities Ltd. in Hong Kong.
 The government “stepped in to protect its own interests,” said Lun.
 “The state cannot allow these tech-run financial institutions to grow bigger than the commercial banks and not be subject to any regulatory requirements," he said.
 At a more basic level, such platforms also are changing the way capital flows through the state-dominated economy.
 “It’s hard for regulators to get comfortable with the scale of these emerging players,” said Duncan Clark, chairman of BDA China, a research firm, and author of the book “Alibaba: The House that Jack Ma Built.”
 “Innovation takes a back seat to stability,” said Clark. “Also, the party superstructure builds in strong links between state-owned banks and the regulators.”
 Investors were shocked and dismayed. They had been looking forward to the hottest IPO of the year at a time when Western economies are struggling.
 “This reminds us of how unpredictable China is,” said Au Yeung, who works in finance in Hong Kong. Au said she aside 160,000 Hong Kong dollars ($21,000), most of her savings, to buy Ant shares.
 Zhang Yuan, a bank employee in Shenzhen, near Hong Kong, said she paid 34,400 yuan ($5,100) for 500 shares of Ant Group. She expressed shock at the suspension but confidence in Ant Group.
 “I am optimistic about Ant Group. It is an innovative company with a good future,” said Zhang, 39. “We ordinary investors may not know something, but we are still optimistic about the company’s future development.”
 The decision also might rattle Chinese entrepreneurs who were considering selling shares on their own country's market, said Rein.
 “Until yesterday, every entrepreneur I talked to wanted to go public in the mainland, because they thought valuations would be better, and it might make them look better in front of the government,” said Rein. “Now, after Jack Ma, I’m not sure what they’re going to do."

PLYMOUTH - It's been a season filled with lessons learned for the Plymouth North cross-country program. Head Coach Cliff Buckley hopes those lessons will be the base for better times for the Eagles down the road.
 The girls are done for the season with a record of 0-5. The boys are 1-3, with a win over Silver Lake, and have one race left to go at Hingham on Thursday.
 "For a number of reasons we were in re-building mode this season. We were really small on the girl's side with eight runners. We had more options in the boys program with about 25 runners, but in that entire group there was only a couple seniors," Buckley said. "The kids learned a lot this season and improved as we went along. Hopefully we all can do some recruiting in the off- season and start building those numbers back to where they've been in prior years."
 "Having such a short window to compete was tough on the team. I think we would have usually started around Aug. 23 and the first day of practice turned out to be closer to Sept. 18. That gave us around six weeks to get ready and have some meets. We all had to take things day-by-day and adjust expectations as needed," Buckley explained. "The kids are just starting to see the fruits of their hard work right now and hopefully they can take those gains into their off-season workouts. We were getting a lot of personal best times at the end of the season."
 Buckley is also the head coach of the winter track and the boys spring track and field programs at Plymouth North. He took over the cross-country program before the start of the season when former head coach John Laverty stepped down.
 The one senior Buckley had in the boys program is his own son, Will. He is co- captain of the boys team along with junior Jason McGettrick.
 "I've had Will on my other track teams before, but it was nice to spend some more time with him this season," Buckley said. "It was fun for me to have the chance to coach him in a different setting. Will was a top runner on the boys side and he had good year."
 Cole Guiliani also had a good season and sophomores Nick Rodden and Jaycob Carpenter improved their times with experience.
 The highlight of the girls season was the addition of sophomore Kelly Palmer who quickly became the lead runner for the Lady Eagles.
 "Kelly is a basketball player. She came out for the team to get in shape for the winter season and we found out she's a good runner," Buckley said. "She did an amazing job this season and made some real improvements in her times as the season went along. By the end of the season she was our clear #1 runner."
 Junior Celina Ohiwa is captain of the girls team. Senior Isabella Pearson ran well and sophomore Olivia Lennon as well as junior Grace McNeill will return with another year of running experience.
 There is still a chance that a final Patriot League championship meet could be scheduled for sometime next week. But if that meet is not organized the Eagles already have their homework assignment for the off-season.
 "There's some recruiting to be done to replenish our numbers and that's something we'll all be working on," Buckley said. One of his off-season goals was to triple the number of runners in the girls program for 2021.

Just like the rest of 2020, we're about to have an unprecedented Election Day.
 Election Day 2020 is really more like Election Week (or, God forbid, Election Month), thanks to the large number of mail-in ballots cast because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Unlike years past, it's unlikely we'll be able to call a winner Tuesday evening in the presidential race between President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden. And beyond the time it takes to count the ballots, legal battles could follow results - lawyers have already lined up across the nation to challenge voting rules and individual votes.
 It is, quite frankly, overwhelming just to vote this year, let alone follow every election update and news development. We want to help you take care of your mental health while you stay informed.
 If you've already voted (and if you haven't voted yet, visit USA TODAY's voter resources page for help), we offer some wisdom, distractions and comfort in what is going to be a stressful week for everyone.
 Be patient, if you can
 We live in an impatient society. We want everything right now (two-day shipping! instant downloads!) and having to wait longer to find out the results of what has felt like an extra-long election cycle can be stressful.
 But preparing yourself for a long haul can help make this week easier. As USA TODAY editor-in-chief Nicole Carroll put it, "The number of mail-in and absentee ballots in many states means counting could go on for days. The delay doesn't mean there is a problem. It means the system is working, and states are ensuring every ballot is counted."
 Limit your news consumption to what you need to know
 You don't need to be glued to your phone or TV screen to ensure you hear important election news.
 "There is a fine line between being an informed citizen and making yourself crazy with all the headlines and social media conversations," says Dr. Linda Anegawa, a primary care physician with virtual health platform PlushCare. "These activities can become not only a time suck, but it can drain your emotional energy."
 If you aren't learning anything new and you are feeling anxious, it's probably a sign you need a break.
 Do something else
 It's OK to spend time this week taking care of your mental health. In fact, it's extra-important to do so when the news is stressful.
 "These are challenging times for us all, so it's critical that we care for our emotional and physical health more than ever," says Anegawa. "It's important that we all fortify ourselves in every sense of the word."
 Mediation, mindfulness, distraction and entertainment can help us relax during this crazy week. Here are some ways you might channel your jittery energy into a non-election activity:
 You can watch one of the best shows on Netflix. Or Hulu. Or Amazon. Or HBO Max. Or Peacock. There is so much TV at your fingertips ready for a distracting binge-watch.
 If you would rather watch a movie than commit to a TV show, here are film critic Brian Truitt's favorites from 2020 (so far). For a kid-friendly option, try one of these 25 great movies.
 Still need a movie? Try one of our 100 favorites. There's bound to be one on the list that you'll love.
 Or maybe you're more of a reader. There's nothing like curling up with a good book. Try downloading one of these top 20 for fall.
 Sam Smith, Bon Jovi and Dolly Parton all released new music in October. Spend some time zoning out with your headphones.
 Start your holiday shopping. There are plenty of sales already starting, but may we suggest one of these 15 products that will help with stress relief. Maybe you need them for yourself. Maybe you need them right now.
 If you don't want to spend money right now, you could also try your hand at DIYing some of these fall fashion trends at home without shopping.
 Plan your safe Thanksgiving. Dr. Anthony Fauci and other medical experts have cautioned against big family get-togethers, but that doesn't mean Thanksgiving won't be festive. Special menus (maybe try Cornish game hens instead of a turkey), Zoom calls with your family, crafts and more can make your Thanksgiving special.
 Stress bake. It's time-consuming, fun and oh-so-tasty. We have recipes for beginners, moderate bakers and experts here. And if you are interested in bread and want it fast, here are some bread recipes that don't require yeast.
 Meditate. If you've never tried meditation before, here are some tips for getting started.
 We recently spoke to some astronauts about how they handle anxiety and isolation. Here are five tips they have for taking care of your mental health.
 Sleep. Daylight saving time is hard enough to adjust to without staying up too late.
 2020 has been trying for all of us. Do whatever you can to stay well during this crazy week in this crazy year. And if you need more support, USA TODAY's newsletter Staying Apart, Together is dedicated to helping you cope with the pandemic and other stressors in your life. It always has a cute pet picture. You can sign up here.
 And don't worry, the election will still be there when you turn back to the news. Follow USA TODAY's coverage for accurate, up-to-date results and analysis.

The virtual gala falls on one of the nights Peachland will be out doing mini light-up events and Rick Ingram of the Peachland Recovery Task Force said they’re going to try and tie in live to a couple of those neighbourhood events
 Along with the entertainment, there will be a silent auction that will open about a week before the event. For those who aren’t computer literate, Ingram said they will offer an in-person viewing where people can come by and take a look at the items up for bid in the silent auction.
 People can also opt to buy a meal ticket and pick up their food before the gala starts. For those who are unable to pick up their meal, there is a limited delivery service through the Peachland Wellness Centre.
 So far, Ingram said four restaurants are on board with a meal option and another three that have committed to participate.
 All the restaurants agreed to donate 10% of their gala meal sales to the beneficiaries.
 The Peachland Recovery Task Force is still looking for the Light-Up Virtual Gala sponsors. If you are interested, contact Madeleine Nixon at 778-214-1999.
 Tickets for the event can be purchased online at trellis.org/light-up-virtual- gala for $25 per person. Optional meal tickets, a place to make additional donations and the silent auction are also accessible at the Trellis website.

In base a quanto contestato dalla procura - il fascicolo e del sostituto procuratore Rosanna Buccini -, il ristoratore avrebbe molestato la sua dipendente in un paio di occasioni: la prima a settembre dello scorso anno quando, una volta che tutti erano andati via, clienti e gli altri dipendenti, si sarebbe avvicinato alla giovane, una ventenne, e prendendola da sotto il mento si sarebbe strofinato su di lei palpeggiandole il seno. La ragazza, sarebbe riuscita a divincolarsi dalla presa e ad andare via, sconvolta. Dopo quel primo episodio la giovane era tornata al lavoro sperando che quella fosse stata solo una brutta parentesi aperta e chiusa, invece di li a poco le cose sarebbero addirittura peggiorate.
 In base a quanto riferito da lei successivamente, dal giorno della prima molestia, il suo titolare avrebbe iniziato a tempestarla di messaggi su Whatsapp e di chiamate fino al secondo episodio avvenuto a meta gennaio di quest'anno quando l'uomo l'avrebbe bloccata in un angolo del ristorante e dicendole che la desiderava, l'avrebbe baciata sul collo strofinandosi ancora una volta su di lei. A quel punto la ventenne era scappata via e aveva raccontato quello che le era accaduto prima al fidanzato poi al padre, decidendo di denunciare il suo titolare di lavoro.
 Si era rivolta all'avvocato Sandro Giustozzi a cui aveva riferito i fatti e tramite il legale aveva presentato una denuncia all'autorita giudiziaria. La segnalazione arrivo al gruppo dei magistrati che si occupa dei reati nei confronti delle cosiddette "fasce deboli" e fini sul tavolo del sostituto procuratore Buccini. Il pm dispose ulteriori indagini per ricostruire i contorni della vicenda e al termine degli accertamenti chiuse il fascicolo a carico del ristoratore contestandogli i reati di violenza sessuale e stalking. Ieri e stata celebrata l'udienza preliminare a carico dell'imputato nel corso della quale l'ex dipendente si e costituita parte civile. Tramite il proprio legale la ventenne ha chiesto un risarcimento di 50mila euro sia per i danni morali sia per quelli patrimoniali dal momento che a seguito dei fatti denunciati era stata costretta a lasciare il lavoro e a perdere dunque la sua fonte di reddito. «La vicenda - ha commentato l'avvocato Giustozzi - mi ha scioccato anche come padre, ho una figlia che ha piu o meno la stessa eta della vittima. Queste cose non dovrebbero succedere».
 L'imputato, difeso dall'avvocato Gabriele Cofanelli, ha deciso di non chiedere riti alternativi convinto di poter dimostrare la propria innocenza nel corso del dibattimento. Il gup lo ha rinviato a giudizio fissando l'udienza davanti ai giudici del collegio 2, presieduto attualmente dal magistrato Daniela Bellesi, al 24 gennaio del 2022. Durante l'istruttoria saranno infatti sentiti i testimoni indicati dalla procura, dalla parte civile e dall'imputato che potranno contribuire a chiarire i contorni della vicenda.

Hamilton agreeing to the CGF's request to switch from 2030 to 2026 gave the southwestern Ontario city preferred candidate status for the latter.
 Hamilton had leeway to scale down its games plan in size and cost. A proposed capital and operations budget of $1.5 billion for 2030 dropped to $1 billion for 2026.
 The number of sports dropped from 22 to 18 and participating athletes, coaches and officials from 6,750 to 5,500.
 Economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic was pitched as a primary benefit in pursuing an earlier games.
 Hamilton's initial 2030 bid had support in principle, but not financial commitment, from the federal, provincial and municipal governments.
 The feds have indicated a willingness to support a 2026 bid, but Hamilton city council approval can't be sought before the province signs on.
 Hamilton's bid committee is therefore in limbo awaiting word on which games it is chasing in what year.
 "Our resolve with respect to potentially accelerating the gains from the bidding structure of 2030 was entirely focused on pandemic recovery and the investment that would come with the games," bid committee spokesman Louis Frapporti told The Canadian Press.
 "It's a question of having the investment and having the event as soon as practicable.
 "So we're going to defer to the province and the federation to continue their discussions to see whether they can work out an arrangement, whatever that might be."
 Hamilton initially pursued 2030 because it would mark of the century anniversary of the city hosting the first edition of the Commonwealth Games, then called the British Empire Games, in 1930.
 Reverting to a 2030 bid is an option, Frapporti said, but Hamilton could again lose out to another city in a multi-bid race.
 "The risks associated with competing, along with the costs, is not remotely as attractive a proposition as a highly-modified games centred on pandemic recovery," Frapporti said.
 "It's a beautiful, wonderful bird in hand or two very elusive birds in the bush if I can put it that way . . . from the perspective of accelerating benefits to a region that is desperately in need of some good news, investment, employment, optimism, hope, having the certainty of the games earlier, rather than having to compete some time down the road for 2030."
 This report by The Canadian Press was first published Nov. 4, 2020.

 While one local legislative race remained a toss-up Tuesday night, all the other Republican legislative candidates on the ballot in Reno County easily won their seats on a night with possibly historic turnout.
 The largest margin of victory appeared to be for three-term 101st District Representative Joe Seiwert, 69, of Pretty Prairie, who garnered 74% of the vote in the district and 78% in Reno County against Democratic challenger Elliott Adams, a retired Marine and software engineer from Goddard.
 Seiwert, first elected in 2009, received 2,641 votes in the county and 7,419 across the district. That compared to Adams receiving 733 votes in Reno County and a total of 2,649 districtwide.
 Rep. Paul Waggoner also easily retained his House seat for the 104 District, capturing 63% of the vote to defeat Democratic challenger Garth Strand.
 Reno County results showed Waggoner with 7,367 votes to Strand's 4,340.
 For the Kansas Senate 34th District, Mark Steffen, who unseated Rep. Ed Berger during the Republican primary, defeated Democratic challenger Shanna Henry by more than 11,000 votes.
 Results posted on the Kansas Secretary of State's website showed Steffen had 20,275 votes, or 70% of the total, to Henry's 8,591.
 In Reno County, Henry received 7,998 votes to Steffen's 18,068. An additional 58 votes were unresolved because they included write-ins.
 In the race of the 114th House seat, which was an open seat after incumbent Jack Thimesch decided not to run, retired airline pilot Michael Murphy, of rural Sylvia, handily defeated retired CPA Jeff Stroberg, of Hutchinson.
 Murphy won 71% of the vote, capturing 6,068 districtwide, including 3,442, or 67% of Reno County. Stroberg received 2,451 votes districtwide, and 1,727 in Reno County.
 It was possibly a historic election night for the county, said County Clerk Donna Patton, with nearly 65% of registered voters casting ballots. That topped the 2016 election, which drew about 60%, Patton said.

This is especially noteworthy because, if you’ve read our story on C.T.’s passing or his obituary (or simply read his many accomplishments in these very pages over the years), you would know that he was the one deserving of such a reception every time he walked into a room. His list of accomplishments, awards and honors over the years reads like the credits of a big-budget movie, endlessly rolling on and on. It’s staggering.
 And just as noteworthy as his own accomplishments were those he helped others achieve over the years, be they a student, a school, his hometown or any number of the many committees, foundations, organizations, clubs, etc. he was a part of.
 But you’d never know about any of that if it wasn’t for press releases, phone calls or emails from other people letting The Times know about C.T.’s latest achievement. He would sing the praises of anyone else before he’d ever speak a word of praise for his own deed. That’s just the kind of guy C.T. was. Always giving, always working for the betterment of others, but never wanting to take any of the credit.
 C.T. was a huge advocate for whatever he was involved in, and he was involved in so, so many worthy causes. He loved to raise others up, and he seemed absolutely tireless in those efforts.
 I’m going to miss C.T. immensely, but I consider myself (and the Fountain Hills community he loved so much) blessed for having known him.

George Ezra has moved back to his family home ahead of England's second national lockdown.
 The Shotgun hitmaker spent the last lockdown alone and, determined not to be caught out again ahead of Thursday's second round of national measures, has now moved out of his London flat to return to his family home in Hertfordshire.
 "It's been another brilliant week and also, the thing I can't overlook is the moving back home and still seeing people I love, which makes a big difference," he said.
 Speaking on his Phone A Friend podcast, the star admitted he loves being at home and, through the years, has spent long periods behind closed doors for a variety of reasons.
 "Three or four years ago there was a trend of people dressing up as clowns in public and scaring people," he recalled.
 "I didn't leave the house for two months. I hated it. I just thought, 'Who is that fun for?'" Ezra divulged.
 "Then scary films. I remember being at friends' houses in groups when I was about 14, 15, and they would be like, 'Let's watch a scary film'. I used to have to say, 'I might have to go home'," he explained.
 "I remember that happening more than once," he added.
 Ezra shared he had also been spooked by Harry Potter movies in the past.
 "I went to watch the first Harry Potter for my little brother's birthday and I had a recurring nightmare for two weeks that they were putting Voldemort's face on my head, but in my family kitchen, and they'd go, 'It's your turn', and it would be welded on to the back of my head," he recollected.

Jones, despite outspending Tuberville 4-1, lost by a wide margin.
 "There's nothing else we could have done. It was a record Democratic turnout, exceeded only by a record Republican turnout," Alabama Democratic Party Executive Director Wade Perry said Wednesday.
 "We've got two years to do a better job. We've got some work to do," Perry said. "I'm proud of Alabama Democrats and very proud of our staff. We worked very hard and had a record turnout. It just wasn't enough."
 David Mowery, an Alabama-based political consultant, said "Republican DNA is hard-baked into the state" making it a difficult path for any Democrat, even a well-funded one. He said Alabama does not have the growing suburban populations that have helped turn some southern states into battlegrounds.
 "We're a Republican state and the only thing that can change that is a big league scandal and a known bad actor like Roy Moore," Mowery said.
 Although he was denied a full term in the Senate, Jones said there was work to continue.
 "At the end of the day, my time in the Senate is going to be over, but our time is just beginning, our time to make our state so much better than what is has been, to make sure we continue the march of progress," Jones said as he stood with his family on stage.
 Jones said he did not regret the votes, such as impeachment and opposing Trump's Supreme Court nominee -- which fueled conservative outrage against him -- because he said those were votes he took on principle.
 Ahead of Tuesday, Jones had acknowledged he faced an uphill battle to keep the seat in a campaign that seemed as much about laying groundwork for the future. He helped install new leadership at the Alabama Democratic Party. The senator also lamented a political environment that has moved to partisan rancor and away from bipartisanship.
 "The Senate doesn't have that kind of deliberative spirit anymore," he said. "There's a lot more friendliness and bipartisanship that goes on behind the scenes that folks don't see, but it needs to be on the floor of the Senate, it needs to be in front of the cameras, it needs to be where people can see these great debates on policy, and on issues, and how you can find that common ground."

I initially got to know C.T. nearly 15 years ago, when he was running for a spot on the local school board. I was only a couple of years into covering the schools beat for The Times and he was looking to offer his expertise and many years of experience in education to the benefit of local teachers and students.
 After our initial meeting, C.T. began greeting me with, “Well, if it isn’t the greatest journalist in town!” The greeting grew over the years, evolving to something along the lines of, “Well, if it isn’t the greatest journalist at the greatest paper in the greatest town in the greatest state in the greatest country in the world!” I assure you, I am not exaggerating. He would throw his hands up, give a big smile and roll out his traditional greeting every time we crossed paths. He would then ask how I was doing, ask after my loved ones and usually complement myself or a colleague on something he had recently read in the paper.
 I’m sure I’m not the only person C.T. greeted in this manner and I wouldn’t be surprised if he informed all of the other Times reporters that they were the best journalist at the best paper in the best town in the state, but the point is that he took the time to make sure everyone felt overwhelmingly welcome and worthy of his time.

John R. "Son" Cumbie moncks Corner - Retired South Carolina businessman, John R. Cumbie, 85, of Moncks Corner, widower of Bonnie Kate Cumbie, passed away Tuesday, November 3, 2020 at a local hospital due to complications of COVID. John was born September 27, 1935 in the Warsaw community, near Andrews, SC, a son of the late John Thomas Cumbie and Nita Cannon Cumbie. As a young man, he was a Gold Gloves boxer for the Kingstree Boxing team and later sailed the Great Lakes as a Merchant Marine in the mid- late 50s. John was a former Pulpwood dealer in Jamestown, SC. As Jamestown's first Mayor in 1965, he was instrumental in hiring the first Chief of Police and establishing the town's first Fire Department. He later opened Jamestown's first shopping center, which included auto parts, furniture, appliance and clothing sales, an amusement company and a finance company. After moving his family to Moncks Corner in the early 70s, John continued his entrepreneurship, owning and operating several businesses including Cumbie's Restaurant and Amusement, Money Tree Finance with over 20 locations throughout SC, Cumbie Chevrolet, and Cumbie Realty John enjoyed spending time with his family and friends and telling stories from his past, such as fighting the orangutan at the Andrews Fair and the first time he met his wife and first love, Bonnie Kate Sullivan. John was a country boy at heart and loved spending time on the farm and tending to his cows. He was a true patriot that never met a stranger, always greeting folks with a hug or a hand shake. Many of his friends knew to pack a lunch if John ever said "let's take a ride"! John felt it was important to give back to his community, which he dearly loved. He donated land for the Berkeley County Museum, Berkeley Intermediate School, Roper Hospital in Moncks Corner, and was instrumental in preserving Fort Fairlawn. He had a passion for purchasing and renovating rundown properties across the state in an effort to improve the surrounding communities. He also enjoyed helping other young entrepreneurs get started in business, offering advice and financial support. Above all, John always felt his greatest accomplishment was having his family work with him in the family business. He will be greatly missed by family, friends, and the community. He leaves behind five children- Deryel Cumbie and his wife, Beth; Dana Cumbie and his wife, Deana; Darla C. Ryan and her husband, David; Dale Cumbie, all of Moncks Corner, and Dion Cumbie and his wife, Mary Chandler, of Summerville; six grandchildren- Jansen Cumbie, Jennie C.

"My own view is that you allow the Americans to decide who's winning before you decide who the winner is," he said in an interview.
 Even though Trump is casting doubt on the legitimacy of the American democratic process, Goldenberg said: "Is it really for us to comment on?
 "I think we'd do better to let the Americans decide what the process is … We're not going to send the army in. We're not going to send the RCMP in. We have to sit and wait and watch."
 Goldenberg agreed with Kergin that the standoff between Trump and Biden leaves the U.S. in a much more precarious situation than the one faced 20 years ago.
 Neither Gore nor Bush "was suggesting that the election had been stolen or rigged or whatever" and the Canadian government knew that eventually, after the recounts and legal challenges, that both sides would "respect the decision," Goldenberg said.
 Unlike now, he said, "We weren't worried about violence in the streets, we weren't worried about that type of polarization."
 During the current uncertainty, Goldenberg said everyone needs to "calm down, particularly when you're outside the United States, because you're not going to change the situation but you could make mistakes" that could hurt relations with the U.S. down the road.
 Kergin said Trudeau's response recognizes that the U.S. "is a democracy" and that to pronounce on the election result before all votes are counted "would be, in a way, not respecting another democratic country, which happens to be our largest trading partner."
 That position, Kergin acknowledged, includes an implicit repudiation of Trump, who is arguing that counting of mail-in ballots should be stopped.
 "That's right, you are, but you are, I think, in line with what you perceive as a democratic process as it's established in the constitution. You don't get into the question of what are legitimate ballots and what are illegitimate ballots."

Gov. Jay Inslee's attempt to win a third term and an effort to repeal a statewide sex-education requirement for public school students top Washington state's general election ballot. Here is a summary of major races on the ballot.
 GOVERNOR
 Democratic Gov. Jay Inslee has been elected to a third term in Washington state, beating Republican challenger Loren Culp. Inslee is the first incumbent elected to a third term in the state in more than 40 years. Culp, police chief of the small town of Republic, campaigned in part against Inslee’s coronavirus restrictions like mandatory masks, saying they infringe on people’s constitutional rights. Democratic Gov. Jay Inslee is seeking a third term, something the state hasn’t seen an incumbent governor do in more than 40 years. He faces Republican Loren Culp, police chief of the small town of Republic, in the Nov. 3 election. The last three-term governor in Washington was Republican Gov. Dan Evans, who served from 1965 until 1977.

Yes. So the 2,100 is our underperforming tractors. And to be fair, those tractors in most cycles have been what’s dragging our results down and those tractors have lost money for a period of time. So, our initial is to convert those tractors into much more profitable model. Obviously, at that point, once we get 2,100 trucks or so in this model or we move some of those tractors over into Dedicated where they are more profitable as well, but only moving into this digital fleet, but as we move all of our tractors and they are all making a return that is acceptable, then obviously at that point, we will evaluate, do we look for net growth or do we then move additional trucks from less profitable areas into more profitable areas. And that’s a decision that we will make down the road. But we are not ready to make that decision today. And probably that does probably depend a little bit about what we are dealing with in the market at that given time. But we think that we want to really try to focus on these 2,100, because they are the ones that have been dragging earnings down and as we get them out of our fleet and into more profitable areas, then you are going see our results obviously align with that.

MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) — Tropical Storm Eta drenched northern Nicaragua and Honduras Wednesday after devastating communities along the country’s Caribbean coast and setting off deadly landslides that killed at least three people in Central America.
 The storm had weakened from the Category 4 hurricane that battered the coast Tuesday, but it was moving so slowly and dumping so much rain that much of Central America was on high alert. Eta had sustained winds of 40 mph and was moving westward at 7 mph.
 The long-term forecast shows Eta weakening to a tropical depression Wednesday, taking a turn over Central America and then reforming in the Caribbean — possibly reaching Cuba on Sunday and southern Florida on Monday.

For his 45th documentary feature Frederick Wiseman trains his lens on his native Boston to record all things municipal unfolding in the cement encased corridors of Gerhard Kallmann's infamous Brutalist facade. The retrospective of how we operate and function in the Hub is an engrossing four-and-half-hour watch (yes, you heard that right) that amazingly goes by in a blip and serves as something of an eerie - and taunting - time capsule. Shot during 2018 and 2019, one segment has Mayor Marty Walsh and authorities preparing for the World Champion Red Sox Duck Boat celebration. Later we see fans chanting "Mookie, Mookie, Mookie." Betts famously left us in 2019 and recently performed his heroics in the 2020 World Series for that team we vanquished in 2018 (the Los Angeles Dodgers), and all that Wiseman's camera captures, strangely feels from another era as the city bustles in pre-COVID normalcy - one can only imagine what a 2020-2021 version of "City Hall" might look like.      The Government Center delve unfolds in a series of chapter-esque meanders between the micro and macro with plenty of shots of Boston's iconic skyline and landmarks to root you. The rendering should make plenty of Beantowners proud and Walsh, seemingly ever aware of the camera, comes off crisp, progressive and inclusive - a shining illumination that may pose something of an extra hurdle for upcoming challenger Michelle Wu and others. In Wiseman's classic observant, cinema verite style (fly-on-the-wall) there are several long takes of municipal proceedings such as the budget review where presenters effusively tout the investment in infrastructure as a win-win because it not only betters the community, but also makes the city's debt more appealing to bond investors. It's a cut-and-dry matter that under Wiseman's eye is more interesting and accessible than it sounds, but "City Hall' is most affecting when following the day-to-day operations of front liners, namely the 311 help center workers trying to iron out neighborhood issues or city magistrates mitigating parking tickets - an anxious expecting father who parked in front of a hydrant and an incredulous old-schooler who didn't know there was resident parking along Congress Street - and then there are those out in the community removing trash and providing subsidized veterinary care.      What's truly amazing to note too is that Wiseman, at the age of 90, is still cranking out documentaries on a near annual basis and does all the editing to boot. For those not familiar with the works of the Academy Award-honored documentarian, a law professor at Boston University and Brandeis before picking up the camera, they're slice of life exposes that quietly drink in their subjects without question, preface or prod the way you might get from a Michael Moore ("Roger & Me," or "Fahrenheit 9/11") or Morgan Spurlock ("Super Size Me"). The result conjures an uncanny sense of intimacy; there's no barrier, you are organically and viscerally part of the scene. "City Hall" in scope and focus feels like a natural addition to the director's unofficial community series that began with "Aspen" (1991) and includes "Belfast, Maine" (1999)" and "Jackson Heights" (2015). Must see Wiseman films in my not-so- humble opinion are "Boxing Gym" (2010) and his controversial first film, "Titicut Follies" (1967) about the Bridgewater State Hospital for the Criminally Insane, which, because of its graphic nature, was banned from being shown in Massachusetts until the early 1990s.      The most moving and telling scenes in "City Hall'' are those steeped in earnest reveals and communal conflict. Talking to veterans afflicted by addiction and PTSD, Walsh candidly shares his dark days as an alcoholic. The connection both onscreen and in the room is immediate and palpable, something that doesn't quite register as much when Walsh underscores his Irish heritage as a bridge to a Latino community. Then there's the Thanksgiving feast for those challenged by Down syndrome and similar arresting disorders where Walsh and crew dutifully serve expectant diners and cap it all off with dancing. Wiseman never lets his lens sway you, but if you don't have a bittersweet bump inside you, you probably didn't flinch when Old Yeller died. The big rub in the film comes during a community outreach meeting run by a predominantly Asian coalition of businessmen seeking to institute a recreational cannabis facility in a predominantly Black and brown section of Dorchester. The two sides talk at each other, the rhetoric's tinged with the annoyance of not being heard and there's the clear fear of being taken advantage of, with the city and the Massachusetts Cannabis Control Commission - who are not in the room - taking the brunt of the shots. It's a telling back and forth that raises the question of equitable economic development and how to earnestly empower a community in the process without gutting them.      One of the things that makes Wiseman's films so captivating is the sense of cadence and human rhythm he imbues them with. "Boxing Gym" and his 2009 ballet troupe portrait "La danse" are driven by repetition and pursuit of form. In "City Hall" there are mesmerizing long takes of mattresses and barbecue grills being obliterated and compacted by a garbage truck's compressor and long spindly tree limbs are methodically pulled in and consumed by a restless wood shredder - activities quite mundane and everyday, that in Wiseman's purview magically become hypnotic wonderments. Also too, Wiseman's longtime collaborator, cinematographer John Davey artfully finds Escher-esque motifs and reflections within reflections amid our familiar facades. His upward angled framings cut aesthetic portraits of old Scollay Square and the bland Saltonstall building in ways one might not have imagined possible. "City Hall" in the end, is a dutiful reflection of who we are, where we came from and a piquant insider look into the vast municipal neural net that keeps us humming as a community.

"The threats to the current president of the United States are very serious," the judge said.
 U.S. authorities claim Ferrier mailed letters containing the poison ricin to the White House as well as to law enforcement and corrections officials in Texas, where she was detained for two months in the spring of 2019.
 The letters contain the threat that if the poison didn’t work, the writer would “find a better recipe for another poison” or “use my gun.”
 A previous court hearing heard Ferrier had a loaded semi-automatic handgun and nearly 300 rounds of ammunition in her vehicle when she was arrested at the U.S. border on Sept. 20.
 Prosecutor Michael Friedman said that was a sign she was taking “concrete steps” to carry out her threats.
 But defence lawyer David Bos – who argued that Ferrier should be released while she awaits trial – said that the fact that Ferrier told border officers she was wanted by the FBI for sending letters containing ricin suggests she was trying to “get to the bottom of this.”
 “At best, what we know is that Ms. Ferrier knew she was being investigated and surrendered,” he said. Ferrier told border officers she had a weapon and there was “no confrontation,” Bos said. She is not facing any weapons-related charges.

Spring flowering bulbs offer an array of color in late winter and early spring that is much needed after a long dreary winter. When most people think of spring-flowering bulbs, tulips and daffodils come to mind. However, there are some other bulbs that you need to consider that will brighten up the garden and add an extra special touch to any spot. Crocus, snowdrops, hyacinth, trout lilies, snowflakes, Muscari, Lily-of-the-valley are a few that come to mind, which I enjoy watching as they unfurl, showing off their beautiful flowers.      Gardening is often an exercise of delayed gratification, and this is certainly true with spring-flowering bulbs. You plant them in the fall and you have to wait until spring to see the results of your hard work. One thing that is great about these bulbs is they return year after year. Plus many bulbs are deer-resistant which is becoming a necessity in certain neighborhoods.      These bulbs are generally planted when the soil is below 60 degrees F in the fall. I have found where I live I can plant as late as November and early December and still get a great display in the spring.      One of the earliest bulbs to break ground in my garden are snowdrops (Galanthus nivalis). They are quite graceful looking and resemble little white bells dancing on a stem. Being so dainty and attractive, and coming as early as they do makes them one of my favorites. They grow well in partial shade with moist to semi-dry soil with plenty of organic matter. Because of their small size, they show up best planted in a mass.      I have one group of snowdrops that always blooms around the first of November but most of them flower just after Christmas. They do better in cooler climates but I have found if you locate them properly in your garden that will contribute to their success.      Crocus is an old favorite for many. These dainty short flowers come in a wonderful assortment of colors, from purple, white, yellow and striped variations, growing about 4 to 6 inches high. I have had some bloom when snow is on the ground, making a pretty picture.      Crocuses prefer well-drained soil and will grow in partial shade or full sun. They are perfect for garden borders and even look great when planted in a lawn. After I plant my crocus bulbs, I put a piece of hardware cloth wire, something smaller than chicken wire, on the top and then cover with soil. This prevents squirrels from digging them up.      Creating a display of Muscari is my latest project. These lovely little flowers are often called grape hyacinth because they resemble grapes on a stem and are similar to hyacinths.      Last year, I planted several thousand Muscari bulbs in a long wide area, trying to have the Muscari flowers resemble a stream of water. I had seen this design planted in his way when visiting Keukenhof garden in Holland. I have been thinking about it for years and I finally took on the project.      Hyacinths bloom around the same time as daffodils and tulips, and have a wonderful fragrance! Small clusters of tiny bell-shaped blooms decorate a stout stem. Hyacinths come in charming shades of blue, pink, baby blue, yellow and white. Flower size may decline in subsequent years, and I really like them better this way because they are daintier.      Ornamental alliums are the rage now. They make a dramatic statement in the garden, especially the varieties with large global heads. These purple pom-pom flowers look quite dramatic when planted en masse. Another interesting fact is they are from the onion family so they are generally deer- and rodent- resistant. Depending on the variety will determine exactly when they will bloom in the spring.   An annual application of compost should provide adequate nutrients. Most spring-flowering bulbs prefer to have the soil moist when they are growing, but want reduced watering as the bulb foliage begins to die back. Be sure to let the foliage die naturally before removing, so that the bulbs can fill their storehouses for blooms the following year. The foliage acts like solar panels, taking in all the sun it needs to develop a lovely flower for the next year.

"Here on the other hand, you had these enormous policy divisions. And that's what's unique about America."
 MICRO-TARGETING THE VOTE
 Tapping into what matters to America's vast and diverse minority populations is a complex matter.
 Buckley says that was most notable among Latino voters, credited with propelling each candidate to victories, depending on which state you looked at — such as Arizona, which turned blue according to The Associated Press' count early Wednesday.
 But in Florida, Trump's triumph was largely credited to Cuban Americans and other Latin American voters, underscoring for many observers the maxim that Hispanics are not a monolith.
 "The racial groups are kind of interesting because Latinos ended up shifting a large part of their votes to the Republicans this time around," says Buckley.
 "And Trump won many more Latinos — the only group he lost was white males. He was five points down from 2016 on white males."
 Trump's depiction of Biden as a leader who would usher in socialism seemed to especially hit home with Cuban and Venezuelan American voters in south Florida, agrees Sam Tanenhaus, a visiting professor at the University of Toronto's Munk School of Global Affairs & Public Policy.
 But Tanenhaus sees it as another example of the mainstream media's failure to pick up on the diversity that exists even within perceived voting blocks.
 "You know they'd been planning that (Florida) campaign for months and months and we never heard about it because instead we have a kind of Ivy League idea of who minority populations are and what they think and what we expect of them," says Tanenhaus, a journalist, author, historian and writer with credits in Vanity Fair, Time, and the New York Times.
 "And it just doesn't work all the time — or even a lot of the time. And we keep doing it."
 THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE
 The odd system used to determine the presidency is yet another electoral quirk unique to our friends south of the border, and it has come under renewed scrutiny by some who deem it unfair.
 As Moscrop explains, U.S. voters don't so much vote for the president but for electors in each state who then cast a vote for the president. Candidates need to secure 270 of the 538 votes available, giving rise to intense battles in key states that can put their tally over the top, regardless of the popular vote.
 "And it's winner-take-all in the sense that if you get to, or pass, 270 you win," he says, referring to a controversial aspect that effectively discounts votes that did not go to the winning candidate.
 Other critics complain it gives outsized representation power to smaller states with smaller populations and puts undue campaign focus on hotly contested swing states.
 Moscrop adds that you rarely get a case where a government isn't made up of the party that also received the most votes, but it does happen.
 In 2016, Hillary Clinton secured popular support by almost three million votes, but nevertheless lost to Trump when he collected 306 electoral votes.
 "The fact is the U.S. has a weird, ridiculous system that no one else uses," says Moscrop.
 This report by The Canadian Press was first published Nov. 4, 2020.

John was born September 27, 1935 in the Warsaw community, near Andrews, SC, a son of the late John Thomas Cumbie and Nita Cannon Cumbie. As a young man, he was a Gold Gloves boxer for the Kingstree Boxing team and later sailed the Great Lakes as a Merchant Marine in the mid-late 50s. John was a former Pulpwood dealer in Jamestown, SC. As Jamestown's first Mayor in 1965, he was instrumental in hiring the first Chief of Police and establishing the town's first Fire Department. He later opened Jamestown's first shopping center, which included auto parts, furniture, appliance and clothing sales, an amusement company and a finance company. After moving his family to Moncks Corner in the early 70s, John continued his entrepreneurship, owning and operating several businesses including Cumbie's Restaurant and Amusement, Money Tree Finance with over 20 locations throughout SC, Cumbie Chevrolet, and Cumbie Realty John enjoyed spending time with his family and friends and telling stories from his past, such as fighting the orangutan at the Andrews Fair and the first time he met his wife and first love, Bonnie Kate Sullivan. John was a country boy at heart and loved spending time on the farm and tending to his cows. He was a true patriot that never met a stranger, always greeting folks with a hug or a hand shake. Many of his friends knew to pack a lunch if John ever said "let's take a ride"! John felt it was important to give back to his community, which he dearly loved. He donated land for the Berkeley County Museum, Berkeley Intermediate School, Roper Hospital in Moncks Corner, and was instrumental in preserving Fort Fairlawn. He had a passion for purchasing and renovating rundown properties across the state in an effort to improve the surrounding communities. He also enjoyed helping other young entrepreneurs get started in business, offering advice and financial support. Above all, John always felt his greatest accomplishment was having his family work with him in the family business. He will be greatly missed by family, friends, and the community. He leaves behind five children- Deryel Cumbie and his wife, Beth; Dana Cumbie and his wife, Deana; Darla C. Ryan and her husband, David; Dale Cumbie, all of Moncks Corner, and Dion Cumbie and his wife, Mary Chandler, of Summerville; six grandchildren- Jansen Cumbie, Jennie C.

At the same time, hundreds of thousands of votes were still to be counted in Pennsylvania, and Trump’s campaign said it was moving to intervene in the existing Supreme Court litigation over counting mail-in ballots there. Yet, the campaign also argued that it was the outstanding votes in Arizona that could reverse the outcome there, showcasing an inherent inconsistency with their arguments.
 In other closely watched races, Trump picked up Florida, the largest of the swing states, and held onto Texas and Ohio while Biden kept New Hampshire and Minnesota and flipped Arizona, a state that had reliably voted Republican in recent elections.
 The unsettled nature of the presidential race was reflective of a somewhat disappointing night for Democrats, who had hoped to deliver a thorough repudiation of Trump’s four years in office while also reclaiming the Senate to have a firm grasp on all of Washington. But the GOP held on to several Senate seats that had been considered vulnerable, including in Iowa, Texas, Maine and Kansas. Democrats lost House seats but were expected to retain control there.
 The high-stakes election was held against the backdrop of a historic pandemic that has killed more than 232,000 Americans and wiped away millions of jobs. The candidates spent months pressing dramatically different visions for the nation’s future, including on racial justice, and voters responded in huge numbers, with more than 100 million people casting votes ahead of Election Day.
 Trump, in an extraordinary move from the White House, issued premature claims of victory — which he continued on Twitter Wednesday — and said he would take the election to the Supreme Court to stop the counting. It was unclear exactly what legal action he could try to pursue.
 Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell discounted the president’s quick claim of victory, saying it would take a while for states to conduct their vote counts. The Kentucky Republican said Wednesday that “claiming you’ve won the election is different from finishing the counting.”
 Vote tabulations routinely continue beyond Election Day, and states largely set the rules for when the count has to end. In presidential elections, a key point is the date in December when presidential electors met. That’s set by federal law.
 Dozens gathered in Detroit Wednesday afternoon, in a square across from the city’s election commission office. Many wore yellow sweatshirts and carried signs reading “Count Every Vote.” Rai Lanier, one of the organizers, said they had planned the gathering so anxious people could come together and channel that energy into hope.
 “This is how democracy is supposed to work,” she said
 Several states allow mailed-in votes to be accepted as long as they were postmarked by Tuesday. That includes Pennsylvania, where ballots postmarked by Nov. 3 can be accepted if they arrive up to three days later.
 Trump appeared to suggest those ballots should not be counted, and that he would fight for that outcome at the high court. But legal experts were dubious of Trump’s declaration. Trump has appointed three of the high court’s nine justices including, most recently, Amy Coney Barrett.
 The Trump campaign on Wednesday pushed Republican donors to dig deeper into their pockets to help finance legal challenges. Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel, during a donor call, spoke plainly: “The fight’s not over. We’re in it.”
 The momentum from early voting carried into Election Day, as an energized electorate produced long lines at polling sites throughout the country. Turnout was higher than in 2016 in numerous counties, including all of Florida, nearly every county in North Carolina and more than 100 counties in both Georgia and Texas. That tally seemed sure to increase as more counties reported their turnout figures.
 Voters braved worries of the coronavirus, threats of polling place intimidation and expectations of long lines caused by changes to voting systems, but appeared undeterred as turnout appeared it would easily surpass the 139 million ballots cast four years ago.
