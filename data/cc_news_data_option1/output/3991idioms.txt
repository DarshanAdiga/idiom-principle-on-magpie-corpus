I have wanted to make this simple yet important point for a long time. The media and the public err in both ways and hugely so. In some cases, especially in fields like theoretical physics, the media (and the part of the public that is brainwashed by the media) seem to think that the expertise doesn't matter and the opinions of a much broader spectrum of "pundits" are equally credible, to say the least.

As a result, Haskins turned in probably the best game of his young career, if not the most efficient, going 32-for-45 with 314 yards and 0 INTs. The offense was routinely able to move the ball down the field and get into scoring position, Unfortunately, they struggled to cap a few drives off, missing a field goal and failing to convert a fourth-and-goal from the 13-yard-line, but that's something that will come as they get more used to the success of being in the redzone. What matters now is that Turner is finding ways to get his QB comfortable in the offense, and it appears to be working.

 Esta cerimónia mantém-se prevista até haver um resultado clínico que justifique alguma alteração, disse a mesma fonte.

Scotland’s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has called a beleaguered SNP MP “Margaret Covid” for the second time.
 Rutherglen and Hamilton West MP Margaret Ferrier admitted on Thursday she had travelled to London while awaiting results for a Covid-19 test, and back to Glasgow after the screening showed she was positive, both by train.
 Ms Sturgeon and other senior SNP figures have called for her to go, but the MP remained silent over the weekend about her future.
 The First Minister announced on Twitter she had told Ms Ferrier, who she described as a friend, she should step down.
 Coronavirus – Thu Oct 1, 2020 \- (Copyright PA Media)
 Asked at the daily coronavirus briefing in Edinburgh about when the SNP knew the circumstances of Ms Ferrier’s trip, the First Minister said: “Patrick Grady (SNP chief whip) didn’t know last Monday or Tuesday that Margaret Covid has suspected or confirmed Covid.”
 Ms Sturgeon made the same slip of the tongue at the briefing on Friday, when she denounced Ms Ferrier’s conduct and said she believed she should step down as an MP.

La “Special Edition” nasce dall’idea di raccogliere alcuni dei talenti scoperti e lanciati da Enrico Rava negli ultimi anni, di età compresa fra i trenta e i cinquanta anni e con varie esperienze in comune alle spalle, che costituiscono una sorta di “all stars” dell’attuale scena italiana più propositiva. Lui invece è un ottantenne che, come accade per i grandi jazzmen, non perde mai quella freschezza di idee che porta a inventare formule e progetti, costruire inedite partnership artistiche, scoprire e valorizzare musicisti emergenti (come Rava Under 21 e New Generation). Grazie a queste nuove leve di cui si è circondato nel tempo, Rava ha continuato a curiosare tra le pieghe della musica e di conseguenza a innovare. Il programma della serata si basa perlopiù su rivisitazioni dei brani più significativi della carriera del leader, la cui biografia rappresenta splendidamente i vari capitoli della storia del Jazz italiano. Dal free jazz dei primi anni della carriera, con Steve Lacy e Gato Barbieri, all’esperienza newyorkese con Cecil Taylor, Carla Bley e la JCO (la monumentale opera della Bley, Escalator Over The Hill), dagli incroci con l’avanguardia europea alla scoperta dell’opera lirica in chiave jazz, per non contare le collaborazioni con alcuni dei più importanti artisti della scena contemporanea.

Racing in Ireland is to continue but without owners in attendance after the Irish Government rejected expert advice to introduce the highest level of restrictions to curb the spread of Covid-19.
 The National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) recommended that all 26 counties be elevated to level five restrictions for the next four weeks, which among other things would have meant no organised sport would be allowed.
 It is understood the Government will instead move the whole country to level three, which is already in place across Dublin and Donegal.
 “It’s back to racing behind closed doors so level three, which means it will only be essential workers allowed,” said Horse Racing Ireland chief executive, Brian Kavanagh.
 “We’re back to the situation we were in a month ago, but the good news is racing can continue and will continue, which is great.”
 The Irish Cabinet met on Monday afternoon to discuss the recommendations after the coalition leaders spoke to chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan about proposals for tighter restrictions, which would have seen the country return to lockdown.

Voyagers normally prepare for their upcoming season as early as April, but COVID-19 caused a delay that lasted into the summer. When the team could take the floor, social distancing practices were put into place and the choreography needed to allow for spacing even between transitions.
 “They have been really good in practices with everyone staying six feet apart, sanitizing their hands and wearing masks when they need to,” Davis said. “I do have to remind them and myself to spread out because it is natural for us to gravitate to each other.”
 Zena Aragon knew going into her junior season that things would be “very different”, but was excited nonetheless for her third year with Voyagers. She plans to challenge herself with performing a solo and to improve her skills over the season. Aragon and the Voyagers opened their season with a performance at the Homecoming pep rally on Thursday and halftime for football, drawing cheers from the crowd both nights.
 “There’s a lot of new faces this year and it makes my heart so happy to look back and see much we’ve improved as a team since day one together,” Aragon said. “We’ve shown how strong we are as a team already. We get along as a group very well and I think that’s showing early, even if our season has been shortened.”
 According to Davis, the team is already learning a new routine and are preparing for a combined state solo/team competition this season. Normally separate, the competitions will be held in Des Moines in late November. Voyagers will take a hip-hop and pom routine to State, along with six soloists this season. Details on scheduling will be announced at a later date.
 “State is always a fun experience because you have 300 schools, over 500 routines and even college teams competing,” Davis said. “It’s three days chock full of dance, and that’s what we live for.”

Ever since I came of age over 50 years ago, Provincetown's annual town meetings have been sacred, not-to-be-missed events for me. Because I care so deeply about the town I've always called my true home, I see it is my duty, even an honor, to participate in policy discussions and crucial voting. And yes, with that responsibility comes the necessity to tolerate what can sometimes feel like endless blathering on not so urgent topics. Everyone has the right to be heard. For better or worse, the ritual has evolved over the years.
 In the early 1970s, eager, often boisterous participants packed the main floor and the balcony of Town Hall every night that the meeting was in session. Sometimes it required three or four days to slog through the entire warrant. Only registered voters, town officials, key employees, and assorted press people were allocated seats. Curious non-voters had the option of viewing the proceedings in the Provincetown High School auditorium via closed-circuit television. Mind you, this was before most restaurants, bars, and other sources of entertainment stayed open year-round. Back then, Town Meeting was pretty much the best show in town.
 I recall roughly 1,400 voters, lifelong townies and "newcomers" alike, jamming available seats. At times the line of difference was stark, but in the main, discourse was civil, even when opinions ran high. The late Herman DaSilva, a tireless advocate for tradition and a devout guardian of the old ways, still kept his cool during most discussions. Sometimes he even made light of his own tendency to ramble on, and on, and on. He truly cared. Even when (or if) I disagreed with a particular stance, I had to admire his fortitude. Nicky Wells, also among the now departed, was an erudite, eloquent voice for reason and finding a middle way.

 My own culture heroes, including the late Captain Charlie Mayo, (Stormy's dad) and artists Phil and Barbie Malicoat spoke to issues close to my heart - education, job security, protection of our environment. Whenever I mustered the courage to approach the microphone and offer my opinion, I knew these revered neighbors had my back. (I still miss them.)
 On rare occasions there were some dust-ups and heated rhetoric, especially when the Drop-In Center was first proposed by nurse Patti Cozzi and her colleagues. I was shocked that their concept for a much-needed mental health/medical center was met by vehement opposition, especially in light of the fact that the town was in the midst of a dire drug crisis. Town physicians were overwhelmed with patients; the closest emergency care was in Hyannis. Heroin was destroying lives; action was needed right away! I'm glad I've forgotten many of the details of "who said what, when." Fortunately, in the end, the life-saving measure was passed and the whole community would benefit.
 As years passed, the nature of Town Meeting changed; for some 20 years my husband and I missed attending altogether because of teaching careers in New Jersey. Upon retirement in 2005, we returned, eager to become Provincetown year-rounders once again. Since then, the makeup at Town Meeting has evolved dramatically. With new voters and new residents came new issues, but attendance dropped precipitously. Gone were the standing-room-only crowds of voters -- gone were many familiar faces -- too many "born and raised townies" stayed away. Suddenly, before the opening gavel on any given meeting, a floor count had to be taken to assure a required quorum was in attendance. And with COVID-19, the entire situation has been further challenged due to health and safety concerns.
 Finally, this year, after delays and postponements, Town Meeting was rescheduled to Monday, Sept. 21 -- albeit with many modifications, a new outdoor venue, and a much lower quorum requirement. I hate to admit that in the face of many concerns -- the darkening days, the chilly weather, the possibly dicey health situation -- I chose not to attend. I regret that decision and feel I let down on my belief in the value and responsibility of participating in our town's democracy. My husband, Dennis, did go, and his report back only solidified my regret. According to him and many others who were there, the meeting succeeded beyond most expectations. Those who attended got the job done for the rest of us "slackers." A lot of credit belongs to those responsible for doing the nuts-and-bolts logistical planning, and the people who showed up to be heard (and counted). I can only say thank you to those intrepid citizens and pledge to try to be braver and more diligent next time. We all know that will happen, the only question is when.

TIRANA, Albania (AP) - Albania´s parliament on Monday approved electoral law changes designed to prevent vote manipulation, which is a key condition for the country to start negotiations to join the European Union.
 Lawmakers present in the 140-seat house voted 97-15 in favor of the amendments and 5 abstained. They also selected new officials at the country's top electoral commission.
 Changes include a 1 percent threshold for political parties to enter parliament.
 The new electoral code will apply from next year's scheduled April 25 parliamentary election.
 Post-communist Albania´s elections have always been contested and marred by irregularities, including alleged vote-buying and manipulation of ballot counts.
 The electoral reform followed recommendations from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which has monitored the country´s elections.
 Albania´s parliament is now dominated by the left-wing Socialist Party.
 The main center-right opposition, which boycotted parliament last year, criticized the new electoral code.
 Earlier this year the European Union gave the green light for Albania and North Macedonia to start full membership negotiations, but has yet to set a date for the talks.

JoAnne Leslie Bond      Willows - Joanne (Leslie) Bond of Willows, CA passed peacefully away at her home on September 25, 2020 surrounded by her loving family. Born in Sacramento, CA on November 10, 1934, she grew up in Redding with parents Alfred and Tena Leslie. JoAnne grew up on the Hope So Gold Mine west of Redding, operated by her Grandfather James Leslie, her Father and Uncles who also owned Leslie's Market at the top of Placer Street. JoAnne graduated from Shasta High School in 1952 and worked at the Cascade Theater and also as a "Switchboard Operator" for Pacific Telephone Company. She met her husband Richard "Dick" Bond on his leave from the Army, and they were married on September 5, 1952 in Reno, Nv. Dick worked for Pac Bell before and after serving in the Army. His job took them from Redding down to Paradise, CA and then on to Chico, CA where they started their family of 3 children; Susan Weiland (Forrest) of Vista/Oceanside, and twins James Bond (Lori) of Chico and Janice Smith (Jess) of Willows. They settled in Willows, CA in 1964 when Dick was transferred to serve as Business Office Manager for Pac Bell, which is where they resided for the past 56 years. Joanne began working at the Willows Public Library on December 1, 1964, and retired 20 years later on March 30, 1985. She touched many lives over those 20 years sharing her love of books and history. She also developed a passion for genealogy in her work as a librarian and was able to trace her family's linage back several generations.      She and Dick enjoyed traveling the US and the world, giving her the opportunity to further her genealogy research. She was a member of the Shasta and Butte County Historical Societies. She also belonged to the "Daughters of the Utah Pioneers" in Redding where she attended regularly sharing in the history of the pioneers in Shasta County. She was a 50 year member of Molino Chapter "Order of the Eastern Star" and the Red Hat Ladies in the Willows area lunching with her friends.      JoAnne was preceded in death by her husband Richard "Dick" Bond in 2019 after being happily married for 67 years. In addition to their 3 children they have 3 grandchildren; Benjamin Weiland (Marisa) of Oceanside, CA, Sarah Bond Allison (David) of San Dimas, CA, and Hannah Bond of Chico, CA.      Cremation is pending through F.D. Sweet and Son, Willows, CA and a memorial service will be planned at a later date to place JoAnne and Dick at Halcumb Cemetery in Montgomery Creek, CA. She figured we could all wave on our way to Moose Camp where she and Dick enjoyed their family cabin for the last 50 years.

 With a win by 18 runs over Kolkata Knight Riders, the Capitals went on top of the points table after four matches and two weeks of the IPL. DC and RCB are the only two sides to have won three matches thus far as I am writing. The two sides lock horns with each other in Dubai on Monday and it will be a top of the table clash.

There was one girl left who had not yet found a home. A couple from Flatbush reached out and beseeched to be allowed to adopt the youngest girl. Here was their story: They were not blessed with children for over fifteen years and had approached the Ribnitzer Rebbe zt"l for a bracha that they merit having a child. The Ribnitzer gave them a unique bracha; he told them that if they would adopt a Jewish child in need and raise that child as their own, they would merit having their own offspring. It seemed to come full circle as the Ribnitzer Rebbe was a staunch supporter of Yad L'Achim. The Rebbe attended Yad L'Achim events, contributed from his own money and gave his bracha to whomever supported them and their work of Pidyon Shvuyim.

 CSK - who have lost three on-the-trot - would look to get back to winning ways. Fans would be hoping Dhoni - who has also faced backlash on social media for his negative tactics - will play the Sunday clash.
 Meanwhile, coach Stephen Fleming has hinted that CSK may not make any changes to the side on Sunday in Dubai.
 “Both Watson and Jadhav are looking for substantial contributions. Shane can light the fuse at any stage and Kedhar the same.
 “It’s just our fourth game so it’s pretty early in our cycle of form, but there is no doubt there is pressure and they will be feeling it more than what I am talking about,” Fleming said ahead of the game.

“We don’t see many teams as big as A-P and they are definitely an improved team,” Jesse said. “We play in one of the toughest conferences in the state. Everyone in our division is ranked right now. It’s a dogfight with each match, and that makes us a better team when we face competition like that.”
 However, Union will compete in Class 3A when regionals come around later this month. The Knights are the only 3A team in the NICL East this season. Facing competition at that level was necessary, so Union invited 3A ninth-ranked Independence to participate in a triangular on Thursday. The Mustangs defeated A-P 2-1 and ended the night with the two 3A squads facing off for a best of three.
 “We knew they had lost some dates and at this point of the season, we were looking for a quality team to play,” Jesse said. “We wanted a great match.”
 The Knights got a quality match as both sets came down to the wire 28-26 and 27-25 in favor of Union. Weber led the Knights with 21 kills, nine digs and went eight of eight serving with two aces. Winkelpleck had 13 digs and Driscol 31 assists.
 “That was great competition for us,” Jesse said. “Independence played scrappy defense. It wasn’t our best match, but we were able to get it done when we needed to. We have to continue maintaining leads when we have them.”
 The Knights went 4-2 and reached the championship match in tournament play at Waverly-Shell Rock this weekend. Union will continue NICL East play with Sumner-Fredericksburg on Tuesday and Dike-New Hartford on Thursday.

The San Jose Sharks acquired forward Ryan Donato from the Wild in exchange for a third-round pick in the 2021 NHL Draft, Minnesota announced Monday.
 Also on Monday, the Wild announced that they re-signed forward Nico Sturm to a two-year, $1.45 million contract.
 Donato, 24, recorded career highs in goals (14), points (23) and games played (62) this past season. He did not notch a point in two games during Minnesota's qualifying-round loss versus Vancouver.
 Donato has collected 57 points (29 goals, 28 assists) in 130 career games with the Bruins and Wild since being selected by Boston in the second round of the 2014 NHL Draft.
 Sturm, 25, had two assists in six regular-season games this past season. Sturm recorded his first career NHL point with an assist at Arizona on Dec. 19.
 TSN reported that the Sharks and Wild are separately working on a deal involving Minnesota goaltender Devan Dubnyk.
 Dubnyk, 34, posted a 12-15-2 record with one shutout, a 3.35 goals-against average and career-worst .890 save percentage this past season.

The case that prompted Thomas' statement concerned Kim Davis, a former county clerk in Kentucky who gained national attention in 2015 and was jailed after declining to issue marriage licenses out of an objection to same sex marriages. The high court on Monday declined to hear an appeal in her case.
 Thomas called Davis "one of the first victims" of the court's "cavalier treatment of religion" in the Obergefell v. Hodges decision but warned "she will not be the last." He said that her case was not properly presented before the court, but he urged his colleagues to revisit the religious liberty implications of the landmark opinion down the road.
 He warned that the court had chosen to "privilege" a "novel constitutional right over the religious liberty interests explicitly protected in the First Amendment, any by doing so undemocratically, the Court has created a problem that only it can fix."
 Thomas also noted that he agreed with the decision to not take up the case, writing that it did not "cleanly present" important questions raised about the decision in Obergefell v. Hodges.

Saini and the rest of the bowlers managed to restrict RR to 154/6 in 20 overs before captain Virat Kohli's unbeaten 72 off 53 balls helped RCB reach the target with eight wickets to spare.
