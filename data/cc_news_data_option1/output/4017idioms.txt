Three persons have been arrested for allegedly cheating people on the pretext of exchanging U.S. dollars at lower rates, the police said Tuesday.
 DCP (North) Anto Alphonse said the accused have been identified as Rohit Kumar, Azizul Khan, and Raju Sheikh. They used to offer U.S. dollars in exchange for INR at a lower rate but would not allow victims time to check the currency notes. The case came to fore when on September 8, Vijay Dahiya from Haryana complained to the police that he had had been duped by a man, who had offered him US dollars at a lower rate. The police said they have recovered USD 150, ₹10,000 cash and ₹1 lakh deposited in savings bank account of one of the accused.
 One accused on the run, the police added. They also recovered three mobile phones and the motorcycle from the arrested accused.

Bloomberg Opinion) -- For the first time since 2011, Apple Inc. didn’t release a version of its flagship iPhone in September. That delay has had a massive ripple effect through its network of vendors, which makes parsing supply-chain data even more challenging than usual.
 Since at least March, we knew that the next installment of the iconic device would be pushed back due to Covid-19. The pandemic initially hit manufacturing lines in China, but continued to impact the rest of the global lineup of companies that contribute to the product, all the way back to the team that develops it in Cupertino.
 Foxconn Technology Group is the most obvious example. Its Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. unit, which assembles iPhones at factories chiefly in China, posted a 21% drop in September sales Monday. It’s not alone. Largan Precision Co., which makes camera lenses for smartphones, reported a decrease of 22%.
 The declines resulted in a 7% fall in third-quarter revenue at Hon Hai, the largest for that period in over a decade. Largan had it worse, plummeting 20% for the quarter. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the major provider of chips for gadgets, is expected to post 11% quarterly growth when it reports sales Thursday. That’s respectable, but slower than recent quarters and could be further hurt by a a strengthening Taiwan dollar.
 What makes the conundrum more revealing, and at the same time confusing, are the different tales being told at these companies.
 Largan’s woes, for example, aren’t limited to the iPhone delay. The September decline wasn’t a one-time event, and actually followed double-digit drops in the previous two months, partly reflecting developments at Huawei Technologies Co. and Xiaomi Corp.
 “Weakening demand for premium smartphone lenses and order cuts from Huawei are the two major factors weighing on product prices and lens shipments,” Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Charles Shum wrote this week of Largan. “Huawei, Xiaomi and other smartphone makers are expected to focus on selling more mid- and low-end models to maintain sales volume during the pandemic crisis.”
 The takeaway here is that consumers may not be rejecting the latest iPhone itself, but simply saving their money and opting not to buy any new top-end smartphone amid the global economic uncertainty. Alternatively, the work-from- home trend and lack of other places to spend money (autumn in Paris, anyone?) could spur people to upgrade.
 With the iPhone to be revealed next week, and the sales launch likely to be absent the ritual queues outside Apple retail stores, we won’t know how well it’s doing until press releases (to be glowing, of course) and news reports (fawning, perhaps) roll in during subsequent weeks. Market researchers may be able to give us hints by late October.
 One of the comforting aspects of a September iPhone release was how it allowed revenue at suppliers to be broken into two distinct phases: ramp-up, reveal, and release in the third quarter; followed by momentum and holiday-season demand in the fourth. This year, it will be crammed into just one period. The first weeks of November and December will be critical for the analysts, traders and investors who parse supply-chain data to get a handle on the world’s biggest tech company. Well before firms report quarterly revenue, Taiwanese companies are required to announce monthly sales.
 If October numbers, to be reported by Nov. 10, don’t show massive spikes, then expect an overreaction in tech stocks. Some bulls will hold on for November data, out in early December, to prove themselves right. Many will wonder whether such data shows true strength, or is merely catch-up demand from a delayed release. But we won’t get a fuller picture until early January, after the quarter is closed.
 This all means that not only must consumers wait longer to get their hands on the shiny new toy, but supply chain watchers will be left on tenterhooks longer than usual.

 In the age of COVID-19, apps like TikTok and Instagram Reels have altered our concept of filmmaking. With everyone living in physically confined spaces, filmmakers have to get creative in how they approach their project, something the Center for Creativity has decided to take advantage of.
 The Center for Creativity is hosting its first One Minute Film Festival, a competition designed to get Pitt students to create films of 60 seconds or less. Throughout the month of October, the C4C will accept and post submissions on its website. The C4C will also host workshops to help filmmakers and screenwriters produce their films.
 At the end of the month, the center will host the festival via Zoom and hand out trophies for first-, second- and third-place winners, as well as a $250 donation to a student organization of the first-place winner’s choice. The C4C will also have a screenplay writing competition with similar prizes.
 Chad Brown, a workshop assistant at the C4C, said he hopes the festival will inspire amateur and experienced filmmakers alike to develop one-minute documentaries, music videos and narrative shorts either safely in a group or alone.
 “With the One Minute Film Festival, we’re trying to show that we all have stories to tell and this visual vocabulary that we can use to express ourselves,” Brown said. “That’s the big driving force behind the film festival.”
 With the emergence of apps such as TikTok and its predecessor, Vine, Brown said he feels filmmaking like this has become increasingly more accessible. Much like these video apps, Brown said these one-minute videos can be shot on your phone or with high quality equipment and can be edited with any sort of software.
 “We accept any form of moving image and that includes ones made on your cell phone,” Brown said. “For folks that don’t have access to that film equipment or editing software, or just want to express themselves through their words, we’re opening it up to them as well through the one-page screenplays.”
 Erik Schuckers — the manager of communications and programming for the C4C — said the festival is open to anyone from any major or department within the University.
 “A one-minute film is something that’s very accessible,” Schuckers said. “It’s similar to the kinds of TikToks and content that [students are] used to. They may not realize necessarily how creative they can be until they give it a try.”
 Schuckers highlighted the convenience of making one-minute films during a semester when many are working from home. He said he hopes this will allow people to work with one another on their films, though the C4C emphasizes that any collaborations should follow all of the University’s COVID-19 guidelines.
 “You can certainly make a film on your own, but the natural inclination, and I think the nature of film, is to bring people together to work on the project,” Schuckers said. “It’s something that’s easier to do — as everything is easier to do — in person. But it can translate, in these times, that you can collaborate across distance and virtually.”
 The festival is open to international and regional campus students, as well. Brown said he hopes that, even with social distancing and remote workshops in place, this event will bring the entire Pitt community together.
 “With social distancing, the film industry as a whole is sort of reeling and figuring out how to restructure and make films,” Brown said. “We’re hoping that people find those creative ways to collaborate, but it’s also totally open to solo artists, international students and satellite campuses. Anybody, anywhere can participate.”
 Aditi Sridhar, a participant in the film festival, said she wants to create a film that’s funny and relatable. Sridhar said she is in the process of writing a screenplay about a college student who wakes up and gets ready to write a paper due that evening, but quickly gets sidetracked until it’s 30 minutes before the deadline. In the rush to get her paper done, she gets a notification from her professor that the deadline is actually the next day, so she pushes the paper off again until the next day.
 “I think all of us feel like we’re going through this, especially during COVID because you’re balancing school stuff, you’re on Zoom all the time,” Sridhar, a sophomore film studies and psychology major, said. “But at the end of the day, you’re confined to your computer and your room and your activities that you can do that are corona-safe in your apartment.”
 In this way, Sridhar said she feels that COVID-19 has also limited how creative the topics of her film can be. She said she thinks many people are tired of reading articles and watching videos about life in quarantine.
 “Films are made to immerse yourself into a different world, and if you’re immersing yourself into that same world that you’re already living in, it’s hard,” Sridhar said.
 Despite the logistical challenges that COVID-19 poses, Brown said the C4C is eager to see how the films turn out. Brown also mentioned that he’s interested to see how working remotely and using platforms such as Zoom will allow the film community to adapt in these times.
 “If we kind of give up a little of what was, and really think about what this technology can do for performing arts, it’s a whole new art form, and it’s kind of exciting to explore that,” Brown said.
 Whether it’s through collaborating on films or taking some free time to paint, Schuckers said the C4C hopes to continue providing avenues for people to create and explore their artistic side throughout the virtual semester.
 “It can be really easy to become disconnected and feel like you just exist when you open your laptop,” Schuckers said. “But the ability to get off of it and do something else, and actually bring something physical into the world that didn’t exist before — whether it’s a painting or a poem — can be even more important right now.”


--DocBreak--
So that space was kind of lost, and we had to innovate it in ways to bring people to a virtual setting, and this is brand-new for a lot of people. Back in early March, we made the executive decision to close our doors, and our administrative staff was working behind the scenes building a new infrastructure to serve the community. During that time, we shifted our mental health program virtually so now it's via telehealth. I run that program, and our numbers right now show more people are accessing our mental health program than ever. We had to increase from two days to five days a week, including Saturdays.

A mother who was “well over” four times the legal limit caused multiple crashes and was swerving all over the Bruce Highway.
 Elizabeth Anne Wells was swerving across lanes travelling at 110km/h with four children in the car.
 Police prosecutor Mark Burrell told Caloundra Magistrates Court police received a report that a driver had crashed into a guardrail on the Bruce Highway on June 7.

 Meth mum’s last warning as jail time looms
 “The motorist indicated the vehicle was swerving all over the road prior to crashing into the guardrail,” he said.
 The court heard police received a further five calls from concerned members of the public about Wells.
 “This included the vehicle swerving across two lanes of the Bruce Highway, going 110km/h,” Senior Constable Burrell said.
 The court heard Wells then took the Caloundra exit and had a minor collision with another car on Caloundra Rd.
 “The defendant has attempted to continue to drive, however the motorist has driven in front of the defendant’s vehicle,” Sen-Const Burrell said.
 “The defendant has ran into the back of the motorist’s vehicle.”
 The court heard Wells started yelling abuse at the motorist, telling them to pull over so “she could find someone to f------ kill them”.
 “When police attended, they found numerous bottles of liquor inside the vehicle, including a half drunk bottle of beer,” Sen-Cst Burrell said.
 Four children were in Wells’ car, who told police Wells had been drinking alcohol throughout the journey.
 “The children in the vehicle appeared to be shaken and emotional,” Sen-Cst Burrell said.   Wells returned a reading of 0.232.
 Wells pleaded guilty in Caloundra Magistrates Court on Tuesday to dangerous operation of a motor vehicle while adversely affected and driving under the influence.
 The court heard Wells had two previous drink driving charges.
 Wells’ lawyer Jacob Pruden told the court Wells had completed the Time for Change program.
 “She continues to attend appointments voluntarily,” he said.
 “She says she hasn’t had a drink since.
 “She doesn’t make any excuses for what she’s done.”
 The court heard Wells had five children.
 Magistrate Haydn Stjernqvist said they were very serious charges.
 “Four children in the car … and you had a blood-alcohol concentration which was very significant, well over 0.2,” he said.
 “Even the children were saying you not only consumed alcohol before the drive, you were consuming alcohol whilst you were driving.”
 Mr Stjernqvist said he could see Wells was taking steps to rehabilitate herself.
 He sentenced her to two years in jail, wholly suspended for three years.   She was also disqualified from driving for three years and fined $800.
