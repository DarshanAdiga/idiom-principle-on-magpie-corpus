We have often complained that a building should be more like a car; James Timberlake once noted that you can drive the cheapest Hyundai into a thunderstorm at 70 miles per hour and it wouldn't leak, yet many buildings can't be left out in the rain. We have also quoted the prefab home salespeople, who say "you wouldn't build a car in your driveway, why would you build a house outside?" So it would make sense that a car manufacturer would be interested in a prefab, engineered solution:

I'm happy to say that the controls for the Switch version feel refreshingly simple. Going back and forth between Pikmin colors is an easy task and rounding them all up is just a whistle away. However, there were a few things that annoyed me over my time with the game. For one thing, it's easy to go overboard on throwing Pikmin. Each button press is equal to one Pikmin, so it's possible to toss too many Pikmin at a target and leave your remaining creature count low. That's a minor quibble, but what isn't so minor is the targeting system. The targeting system is a finicky beast and there were several instances where I'd try and aim for a target, only to lock onto something else entirely. That's irritating when trying to retrieve a fruit or reach an out-of-the-way area, but it's downright deadly during boss fights.

Grand Rapids police spokesman Sgt. John Wittkowski says officers found six headstones spray-painted with “relatively new” red paint on Monday. “TRUMP” was spray-painted on the back of four headstones, and “MAGA” was spray-painted on two others. The vandalized graves were discovered at the Ahavas Israel Cemetery hours before Trump visited Grand Rapids late Monday in his final campaign rally before Election Day.Copyright 2020 Associated Press.

There was also some concern about how shoppers reacted to robots doing the work, according to the report.Bossa Nova, which was founded in 2005 in Pittsburgh didn’t immediately respond to an emailed request for comment Monday.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.

NEW BRIGHTON, England -- Britain's new polar ship, the Sir David Attenborough, headed for the open seas on Tuesday to start trials after a storm delay, before making its maiden voyage to Antarctica next year for climate change research.
 The $260 million, state-of-the-art, polar research vessel, with its red hull and a bright yellow crane on its stern, sailed past Liverpool's historic docks and out into the sea, headed for north Wales.
 Officially the ship is named after the veteran BBC naturalist David Attenborough, but to many Britons it will always be known as "Boaty McBoatface," after that suggestion topped a public poll to name the vessel in 2016.
 Its departure from Liverpool was delayed by around a week due to stormy weather, a British Antarctic Survey (BAS)spokeswoman said, with calm seas preferred to test and calibrate its specialized equipment for the first time.
 It will remain at sea for just under a week before berthing in Holyhead, Wales, once the current Welsh coronavirus lockdown ends on Nov. 9, the spokeswoman added.
 The BAS will operate the ship, carrying out ice trials in the Arctic in early 2021 before a journey to the Antarctic in November next year, where scientists say it will transform UK research in polar regions.

Hi! My name is Zero Suit Samus (or Samus for short), and I'm an energetic pitbull mix who needs some love. And I really mean that. I need a family who will cuddle with me because your penalty for not giving me cuddles is to hear the cry of my people. My foster dad says that based on my crying, I must have descended from pterodactyls, but that's silly because pterodactyls don't even like peanut butter. And I looove peanut butter. And treats. And strawberries. And watermelon. And anything, really. Honestly kid, if you give me your salad, I'll eat it. Don't want your broccoli? I'll take care of your problem. See that toy? It's in my stomach now. See that puke? Well, you can have your toy back.
 Like all superdogs, I have an origin story: I ran across the highway and caused a 4-car pileup that I ended up underneath. It wasn’t my best choice, but it’s still a better love story than "Twilight." I have to take daily medication now, or else I have pretty severe seizures. But I like to think of my epilepsy as my unbridled superpower that the world just isn’t ready for yet.
 I'm a Tulsa native, but I'm still not a fan of the Bermuda grass around here - I get allergies in the summer, so that's something you should know. Despite this, I still love running and rolling in the grass, and if you toss me a ball, I can jump and catch it in mid-air even when it's 6-feet high. I'm not exaggerating. (Pterodactyl dogs never exaggerate.) And would you mind spraying me with a hose once in a while? I love playing in water, especially when it's coming out of a tiny hose at jet-like speeds.
 But if you have another dog in the home, then forget about it because I'm a single-dog dog. A lone wolf. A rebel. I will not share my toys, I will not share my food, and I will not share my family. I do just fine around other dogs in general, but once you introduce toys or food, then I get very territorial. Can we agree that I'll be your only one?
 By the way, I love kids. I don't have these problems with other humans, so don't worry about bringing me home to your young ones. I am loyal to the bone. Don't believe me? Try going for a jog with me. I will keep pace with you the entire time, just running by your hip. Need me to lick the sweat off your face after an especially hot run? Baby, that's what I'm about. I'm a good dog. My foster family says so, too. I will take care of you if you let me. I'm eager to learn, I don't catch coronaviruses, and I'm housebroken. I won't poop in your Cheerios. Unless that's one of your commands, but why would it be? Don't want your Cheerios? Just let me have them instead.

A vanilla commercial dispute is setting the stage for a clash between the world's No. 1 and No. 6 richest men. But the legal wrangling is a sideshow. What Jeff Bezos and Mukesh Ambani are really fighting over is pole position in the only billion-plus-people consumer market available to both of them: India.
 The ostensible battleground is a $3.4 billion deal Indian tycoon Ambani's Reliance Industries stitched up in August to acquire assets of debt-laden local retailer Future Group. Bezos's Amazon.com is trying to block the transaction.
 That, in itself, is a bit of a dampener. Expectations were building for the two billionaires to work together. In September, Bloomberg News reported that Ambani had given Amazon an option to buy as much as 40% of Reliance Retail Ventures, seeking to repeat the success he had earlier this year in bringing in Facebook and Alphabet as partners to his digital platform.
 By seeking to stall Ambani's purchase of Future, Bezos may be signaling that he would rather remain a rival. Or, that he's buying time to sweeten the offer currently on the table.
 The actual quarrel is only interesting when you read between the lines of the claims and counterclaims.
 Amazon bought a 49% stake last year in a private firm controlled by Kishore Biyani, a pioneer of modern-format retailing in the country. The investment gave the U.S. e-commerce giant the right to acquire Biyani's shares in the publicly traded Future Retail from the third year. Another of Bezos's conditions was that Biyani wouldn't sell his assets — about 1,500 stores nationwide — to restricted persons, including Reliance, which operates India's largest retail chain.

RICHMOND, Va. - Organizations and residents in Richmond are bracing for potential activity related to the U.S. presidential election results.Richmond City officials said they will work with local and state partners to ensure public safety during and after the election.“We encourage all residents to peacefully participate in our democracy and observe public health and public safety protocols in exercising their rights,” city officials said Monday in a statement.Virginia Commonwealth University closed parking decks on Monroe Park Campus in Richmond from Monday night until Wednesday morning due to “potential activity on campus surrounding Election Day.” The closure excludes the West Main Street Parking Deck where temporary parking accommodations are available.Protests have erupted around the nation, including Richmond, since May. Demonstrators called for social justice and police reform after George Floyd died in police custody. Floyd’s arrest was viewed around the world, with reaction to the officer kneeling on Floyd’s neck for almost 8 minutes sparking months of protest. People also flooded the streets calling for justice in the shooting of Breonna Taylor, who died when police opened fire while serving a warrant. Those deaths and others fueled a sustained call for police and criminal justice reform that has transformed the election.Richmond protests were less frequent in the fall. The initial weekend of protests after Floyd’s death saw widespread property damage throughout the city which included graffiti, broken windows and stolen property. An 8 p.m. curfew was established a few days later and Virginia State Police joined forces with local police. There were nights of clashes between demonstrators and officers. That’s left many people anticipating a strong reaction to the election, and some residents still expect civil unrest after a political rally Sunday at the area surrounding the Robert E. Lee monument.Richmond City Council candidate Mike Dickinson led a “Trump Train 2” rally from Henrico County to Richmond, which ended with police investigating an unoccupied car struck by gunfire and a woman being pepper-sprayed. These caravans in support of President Donald Trump recently have been parading through areas around the nation ahead of the election.Rumors have circulated that another “Trump Train” would head into the city on the evening of Election Day. Dickinson released a statement on Facebook that he and his supporters have nothing to do with it and he encouraged people to “keep the peace.”“My campaign and I are not associated with any Trump Train event at all today and are not sponsoring any Trump Train event today,” the statement said. “We have shared everything we’ve found online about this potential event with the police.”Richmond resident Isabelle Munnikhuysen heard the political rally from her apartment located on West Grace Street near the monument.“It definitely increased my fears about what tonight is going to be like,” Munnikhuysen said. “I feel more in danger.”Many local businesses on West Broad Street situated remain boarded up due to damage from previous protests. But some businesses opted not to close on Election Day, a state holiday, and remained open regular hours.“It is important for us to be ready and prepared,” said Lift Café manager Emily Nguyen. “But we just haven’t decided as a team what message (boarding up) sends.”Copyright 2020 Capital News Service.

One responsibility of a film critic is to let prospective viewers know that even if a movie is being strongly recommended, it's imperative to point out that some of its contents could be upsetting. In the case of "Let Him Go," an adaptation of the 2013 novel by Larry Watson, my warning is that it's a story filled with unsettling tension, harrowing plot turns, and instances of almost unspeakable violence.      Now, before anyone decides this is not a film they want to see, let me dial that back. Yes, there is violence, of both the emotional and physical sort. But there's no outright gore, it's not gratuitous, and every bit of it serves to help define characters, to delineate the difference between the good guys and the bad guys. Note: The nice folks are outnumbered by those who would do them harm.      Yet the film has a gentle beginning. It's the early 1960s. A young man, James, is in a corral, working with his horse. James and his wife Lorna (Kayli Carter) and new baby Jimmy soon get together for breakfast with his parents, George and Margaret (Kevin Costner and Diane Lane) in the Montana farmhouse the family has called home for years. There's a slight hint that Lorna thinks Margaret is getting too attached to little Jimmy, otherwise all is well.      But just minutes in, tragedy strikes. James is killed when he's thrown by his horse. The film jumps ahead a few years, Lorna is marrying a fellow named Donnie Weboy (Will Brittain), and moving into town, and Margaret is unhappy that 3-year-old Jimmy won't be around the house anymore.      She's much more than unhappy when, a short time later, in town on errands, she sees, from afar, Donnie slap Jimmy, then slap Lorna. Soon after, paying a visit to Lorna to find out what's going on, Margaret discovers that all three of them have left town, without a goodbye, to live with Donnie's family in North Dakota.      What's a doting, strong-willed grandma to do? In this film of wildly shifting moods and unexpected turns of plot, she makes a snap decision. She will go to North Dakota, find the Weboy family, and bring her grandson back home, where it's safe. That she doesn't immediately tell George - a retired lawman, by the way - of her plan doesn't surprise him. After decades of marriage, he's well aware of Margaret's tendency to make up her mind on something, then follow through. They hop in their Chevy station wagon - in which she conveniently forgets to tell him she's packed his old six-shooter - and begin their long drive.      What unfolds is a story focusing on love of family, in all of its many forms. They go looking for the Weboy family - which some folks they meet choose to call the Weboy clan - and get, among other veiled warnings, a suggestion that they are not people to mess with.      The road trip also reveals that George and Margaret have had their own ups and downs, but love each other mightily and, despite his initial doubts about what they're doing - "Do you really think Lorna is just going to hand him over?" he asks - it's clear that they're in this thing together.      Turns out it's not Lorna they should be worried about. A meeting with ever- smiling Bill Weboy (Jeffrey Donovan), a cousin of Donnie, results in the film taking on an aura of menace. Their arrival at the isolated Weboy farm - where they've, to their amazement, been expected, results in an introduction to Blanche Weboy (Lesley Manville), the smoking, drinking, chattering tough customer of a matriarch, who is off puttingly frightening. When her brood of big lug sons arrive at the dinner table, things get really uncomfortable for our out-of-their-element protagonists.      It's from here on that it all shifts from being tense to becoming almost unbearably unnerving, and is where the violence starts to rear its head. Kudos to everyone involved for across the board terrific performances, and for creating a film that, despite what they're being shown, will not let viewers avert their eyes. The conclusion will earn different opinions from different people, but all will undoubtedly admit they've gone through a riveting experience.      "Let Him Go" opens in theaters on Nov. 6.

WILMINGTON, Del./WASHINGTON -- In the final hours of an election held amid a pandemic gripping a deeply divided United States, Americans streamed to the polls on Tuesday to choose between incumbent President Donald Trump and challenger Joe Biden on a day with little of the disruption many had feared.
 Voters, many wearing masks and maintaining social-distancing to guard against the spread of the coronavirus, experienced long lines in a few locales and short waits in many other places. There were no signs of disruptions or violence at polling sites, as some officials had feared.
 The winner -- who may not be determined for days -- will lead a nation strained by a pandemic that has killed more than 231,000 people and left millions more jobless, racial tensions and political polarization that has only worsened during a vitriolic campaign.
 A third of U.S. voters listed the economy as the issue that mattered most to them when deciding their choice for president while two out of 10 cited COVID-19, according to an Edison Research exit poll on Tuesday.
 In the national exit poll, four out of 10 voters said they thought the effort to contain the virus was going "very badly." In the battleground states of Florida and North Carolina, battleground states that could decide the election, five of 10 voters said the national response to the pandemic was going "somewhat or very badly."
 Biden, the Democratic former vice president, has put Trump's handling of the pandemic at the center of his campaign and has held a consistent lead in national opinion polls over the Republican president.
 Biden, 77, appeared to have multiple paths to victory in the state-by-state Electoral College that determines the winner; at least 270 electoral votes, determined in part by a state's population, are needed to win.
 Trump, 74, was close enough in several election battleground states that he could repeat the type of upset he pulled off in 2016, when he defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton despite losing the national popular vote by about 3 million ballots.
 "I'm hopeful," Biden told reporters in his home state of Delaware, after earlier appearing in the pivotal state of Pennsylvania to make an 11th-hour appeal to voters.
 "What I'm hearing," Biden added, "is that there's overwhelming turnout, and overwhelming turnout particularly of young people, of women" and in some states of older Black voters -- groups expected to favor him.
 "I think we're going to have a great night," Trump said in Arlington, Va., across the Potomac River from Washington, where he thanked campaign workers. "But it's politics and it's elections, and you never know."
 "Winning is easy. Losing is never easy -- not for me it's not," Trump added.
 Ahead of Election Day, just over 100 million voters cast early ballots either by mail or in person, according to the U.S. Elections Project at the University of Florida, driven by concerns about crowded polling places during the pandemic as well as extraordinary enthusiasm.
 The total has broken records and prompted some experts to predict the highest voting rates since 1908 and that the vote total could reach 160 million, topping the 138 million cast in 2016.
 Trump Tuesday admitted his voice was "a bit choppy" after making speeches at numerous raucous rallies in the final days of the campaign. Seeking a second four-year term, Trump said he would not declare victory prematurely, adding "there's no reason to play games."
 In Pennsylvania, Biden first stopped at his childhood home in Scranton, where he signed one of the living room walls, writing: "From this house to the White House with the grace of God. Joe Biden 11-3-2020."
 He later visited Philadelphia and used a bullhorn to address supporters who chanted, "Joe, Joe, Joe."
 "It ain't over till it's over," Biden said in front of a block of brick rowhouses.
 In anticipation of possible protests, some buildings and stores were boarded up in cities including Washington, Los Angeles and New York. Federal authorities erected a new fence around the White House perimeter.
 Referendum on Trump
 Supporters of both candidates called the election a referendum on Trump and his tumultuous first term. No U.S. president has lost a reelection bid since Republican George H.W. Bush in 1992.
 In Atlanta, Cody Sellers, 32, a registered Republican and project manager at a home improvement store, voted for Biden.
 "Trump is the issue," Sellers said, shivering in the cold.
 "I really think Trump is bad for our country," he added. "He's divisive. We're on a path to trouble. I'm not thrilled about Biden, but he can do the job and he cares about our country."
 Polling showed Georgia, long a Republican stronghold, was possibly up for grabs this year, but Victor Akinola, 44, stuck with Trump.
 "The hopes that liberals have for a so-called blue wave is unfounded. Georgians won't vote en masse against their own local interests," said Akinola, who works in information technology.
 Among the most closely contested states that were expected to determine the outcome are Pennsylvania, Florida, Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina, Arizona and Georgia, with Democrats hoping that Biden could even threaten Trump in states that once seemed certain to go Republican, such as Ohio, Iowa and Texas.
 Voters on Tuesday also decided which political party controls the U.S. Congress for the next two years. Democrats were narrowly favored to recapture a Senate majority and retain their control of the House of Representatives.
 The FBI was investigating a spate of mysterious robocalls urging people to stay home on Election Day. New York state's attorney general also was looking into such robocalls.
 A judge ordered the U.S. Postal Service to sweep mail processing facilities on Tuesday afternoon for delayed election ballots and immediately dispatch any for delivery in about a dozen states, including closely fought battlegrounds like Pennsylvania and Florida.
 U.S. stocks closed sharply higher as investors bet it would be decided without a prolonged process, leading to a swift deal on more pandemic-related fiscal stimulus.
 TURBULENT PRESIDENCY
 With so much at stake, nerves were frayed across the country.
 "I feel sick to my stomach, but positive," said Nancy Osborne, 71, a retired teacher and Democratic Party activist in suburban Detroit.
 Biden has promised a renewed effort to fight the public health crisis, fix the economy and bridge America's political divide. The country this year was also shaken by months of protests against racism and police brutality.
 Some crucial states, such as Florida, began counting absentee ballots ahead of Election Day. Others, including Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, were barred from processing the vast majority of mail-in ballots until Election Day, raising the possibility of a vote count that could stretch for several days.
 Trump has asserted, without evidence, that mail-in ballots were subject to fraud and has hinted at court challenges.

Rocco loves to play with everyone. He is a lover and a cuddler and has a great personality. He has high energy, loves to go on walks and is a great companion on walks. He is smart, loves his treats, frisbees, rope, balls and he will bring his favorite - a tug-o-war with rope. Rocco is 2 years old and is very low-maintenance, doesn't need/want constant attention but does love to sleep with you any chance he gets to sneak in bed. He LOVES the water and using his sniffer to find ANYTHING while out walking, hiking, shopping etc. Rocco actually prefers men first over women and he's not much of a "in your face" right out of the gate kind of dog. He is still very leery about kids, but you can't blame him as he was abused by one previously, but does ok if they just leave him alone. Older kids would be best, but it does take him awhile to warm up to them. NO CATS because if it moves quick he goes after it. He gets along great with other dogs and he is very audible when he plays so that can take some getting used to. Rocco comes with his fair share of emotional history (don't we all?), but he is going to be the perfect fit for that perfect someone and one of his many perks is he'll make sure you're NEVER lonely in the bathroom. Rocco is a STAR Prison Training Program graduate and is fully vaccinated, neutered, microchipped and is available for adoption through Compassionate Animal Rescue Efforts.

But, the worst mechanical offender involves using multiple captains. It's possible to navigate out-of-reach areas by tossing over another captain and sending some Pikmin their way. It's actually a cool idea on paper. However, there were multiple instances where I'd switch over to the other captain and blow my whistle a little too hard. That meant not only did the second captain call their Pikmin, they accidentally called the _other_ Pikmin from afar, which led to them running straight into a deadly creek, Lemmings-style. Collecting stray Pikmin was my main source of aggravation and it reached a point where I'd end a day and just leave them to rot. I didn't feel too bad about it, because Pikmin quickly prove to be expendable resources and it's pretty easy to build a surplus.
