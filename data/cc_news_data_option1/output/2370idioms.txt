MASSENA — Massena Mayor Timmy J. Currier says a mandate by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo to publicly meet with people in their communities and reinvent policing strategies has already been taking place for decades in the village.
 The governor signed an executive order, named the New York State Police Reform and Reinvention Collaborative, which was passed by the state Legislature. It mandates the community meetings and reinvention of policing strategies.
 Police forces throughout the state must develop a plan by April 1, 2021 to be eligible for continued state funding. The municipality that oversees the law enforcement agency must certify, adopt and enforce the plan as a local law or risk losing future funding for their police department.
 The plan must address the law enforcement agency’s use of force, crowd management, community policing, implicit bias awareness and de-escalation training, restorative justice practices, community outreach, a transparent citizen complaint procedure and other issues specific to each community.
 Mr. Currier, who retired as chief of police, said he was confident that policies and procedures that had been developed in Massena over the decades, including during his tenure and the tenure of current chief Adam J. Love addressed the issues that were of concern to the governor.
 He said community engagement and managing relationships with the community have been a hallmark of the Massena Police Department over the years.
 “I’m really confident where we are. We take this very seriously,” Mr. Currier said.
 However, he said, while he was very concerned about racism in the country, he felt that there should have been input before the governor signed the mandate.
 “We have a number of concerns,” he said. “I’m not suggesting it’s not a serious issue. I’m very concerned about racism in this country. I’m really concerned about police brutality.”
 But, the mayor said, he was concerned that the mandate was rushed through quickly and put in place without any comment, debate or discussion.
 “We should be able to have discussions” about the best ways to reform the criminal justice system, he said.
 He said money could have been better spent through areas such as education and community involvement.
 “That’s a really important conversation to have,” Mr. Currier said.
 He said many people, himself included, have been disgusted by some of the actions they’ve seen between police and community members. He said there were good officers and bad officers and “by and large, they’re doing a good job under difficult circumstances.”
 For instance, he said, law enforcement has taken over in areas where they were not qualified, such as mental health and child protective services, and were asked to do those tasks on the night shifts and weekends.
 “They’re not trained in it and they’re not qualified and it’s not a recipe that deals a very good result,” he said.

MACOMB - When you are building a roster and program from the ground up, you have to get to work.
   
 And if you're going to put in the work, it is good to have a little help from your friends.
   
 That is exactly what Western Illinois men's basketball coach Rob Jeter has done in recent weeks, building his staff and roster, bringing in those he knows and trusts.
   
 Step one for Jeter was bringing in Chad Boudreau as his associate head coach.
   
 Boudreau and Jeter have worked together at several previous stops and with the familiar pairing together again, along with assistant Kyle Heikkinen, who was on Boudreau's staff at Highland College in Freeport, Illinois, Western is on the way up.
   
 "I worked with Chad Boudreau for 11 years in Wisconsin, so we had talked about putting things together and putting a staff together," Jeter said. "He's my associate head coach, when you're going to put things to place when you get a job, you want to hit the ground running, that's part of what I told Western.
   
 "I have a bunch of dudes ready to roll, just need a place and we found a place with a staff ready to go."
   
 Another home run staffing hire was Nick Irvin. Irvin coached at Morgan Park High in Chicago and has already used his connections in the Chicagoland area to add to the Leathernecks program.
   
 Getting Irvin to make the jump to college was not a difficult one, as it was another case of old relationships coming together at a new place.
   
 "I think having time to get to know Nick, I really like him and it seemed like he was looking for a situation he felt comfortable with," Jeter said. "It was more than a place he was going to be, but who he was going to be with, we had a pretty good relationship, so it made pretty good sense to make the move to Western.
   
 "If a lot of people are wondering why he came here or why didn't he go there, a lot of it comes down to relationships more than anything and that's the one thing we're selling about Western. It's about relationships and really good guys that we're putting together."
   
 Previous relationships and coaches with high pedigree have been beneficial for Jeter.
   
 With the COVID-19 pandemic and NCAA recruiting restrictions in place, coaches have had to rely on what they can sell recruits, whether it is over the phone, online or through past connections, instead of the usual face-to-face time.
   
 "Because we have a veteran staff, it's so important to have that when you take a job in the midst of what we're going through," Jeter said. "You can rely on your relationships, veteran coaches who have been around so that people do trust you, they do believe in you and I think that's helped so that we haven't really slowed down.
   
 "Now all we need is a season, get people on court and play."

Wright brings front- and back-of-house restaurant experience to the table for Alpine Burrito, and some of that experience may have paid off as the opening process was stymied for several weeks as North Carolina dealt with the COVID-19 pandemic, including the halting of dine-in service for quite some time.
 “It’s been hard,” she said. “We had actually signed for the lease on this building in February. My husband did all the construction here. He added on, and all that. We expected like a month of renovations and clearly didn’t see anything like this coming. It put us in a bad situation.
 “It was either we get passed by the health inspector or we just give up now. We forked out all of our savings on both sides, and it was just like, ‘What’s next?’ If we don’t get open now, we might as well just not even try to open.”
 Wright said the feedback so far has been very positive, though she noted that Alpine Burrito is open to constructive criticism. Freeman added that the group still is learning on the fly.
 “It’s gone great so far. No complaints,” Freeman said. “We’re building a great customer base. They’ve left us a lot of good reviews. We’re constantly striving to do better and improve in certain areas where we can. It’s kind of a learning process right now because we’ve only been open for a month.
 “I’ve just seen different ways people order their food where I’ve never thought of it that way. I’ve found some new flavors that are really cool. Opening a restaurant, you learn a lot of things trying to keep track of everything, keeping everybody in order and rearranging the kitchen to make it more successful and more productive.”
 Alpine Burrito’s hours of operation are 11 a.m. to 9 p.m. Monday through Thursday, 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. Friday through Saturday, and 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. on Sunday. For more information, call 828-334-3518.

CANTON — After three weeks of consistent and ongoing global Black Lives Matter rallies that call for change to address systemic racism, north country police forces, like the hundreds of other law enforcement agencies in New York, will be required to evaluate their policies over the next nine months.
 Under Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo’s Friday executive order, called the New York State Police Reform and Reinvention Collaborative, policy evaluations are expected to be based on 10 police reform laws as part of the state’s “Say Their Name” reform agenda laid out by Gov. Cuomo after the May 25 killing of George Floyd. The 46-year-old unarmed black man was killed by a white and now former police officer charged with second-degree murder in Minneapolis.
 Four of the 10 reform bills, all passed by the state legislature last week, were signed into law Friday; three additional reforms were signed by Gov. Cuomo on Monday.
 The reform laws include publicizing law enforcement personnel records by repealing Section 50-a of the state’s Civil Rights Law; banning police from using chokeholds or other neck restraints and attaching a felony punishment to their use; criminalizing false, race-based 911 reports; and designating New York’s attorney general as an independent prosecutor for police-involved deaths of unarmed civilians.
 During the village of Canton’s regular meeting Monday night, Canton Police Chief James R. Santimaw delivered an overview of the Canton Police Department’s preliminary response to the executive order, which mandates agencies develop reform plans by April 1, 2021 — the state’s next budget deadline — to be eligible for state funding. The municipality that oversees the law enforcement agency, the Canton village board of trustees in this case, will be responsible for certifying, adopting and enforcing the plan as a local law.
 According to the order, plans must be developed in collaboration with the public through an “open process on policing strategies and tools” and receive public comment before being presented to local municipal bodies for approval. Plans must address the law enforcement agency’s use of force, crowd management, community policing, implicit bias awareness and de-escalation training, restorative justice practices, community outreach, a transparent citizen complaint procedure and other issues specific to each community.
 “We always want to be part of the community,” Mr. Santimaw said Monday. “If the community doesn’t want us here, then obviously we’re not going to be able to keep everybody happy, or have people like what we do or what we’re about, and they’re not going to want us here.”
 The Canton Police Department mission statement does not mention working to “keep everybody happy,” though it affirms the department’s responsibility “to work with all citizens to preserve life, maintain human rights, protect property and promote individual responsibility and community commitment.”
 And the annual financial cost earmarked to support that responsibility isn’t cheap.
 The village’s $6.7 million budget for the 2020-21 fiscal year designates $1,045,747 for Canton PD, which represents 15.7% of the village’s total budget and a $21,664 increase in police funding from 2019-20.
 Since 1993, Canton PD has been accredited by the New York State Accreditation Council, a governor-appointed group that adopts standards, sets policy and has exclusive authority to grant accreditation to law enforcement agencies, according to the state Division of Criminal Justice Services.
 Canton PD has been reaccredited five times since its initial accreditation for meeting certain administrative, training and operations standards. The department received its most recent reaccreditation in October 2019.
 Currently, St. Lawrence County has two agencies accredited by the council: Canton PD and SUNY Potsdam University Police. The St. Lawrence County Sheriff’s Office is in the process of becoming accredited.
 During the accreditation process, council representatives visit agencies and review all policies against critical standards evaluated and set quarterly by the 17-member council.
 “We have that accolade in our back pocket, and that’s going to help,” said Mr. Santimaw, who has been with Canton PD in varying capacities since 1998. “One thing I have learned being a part of that (reaccreditation) process — and it’s a very involved process each and every time — is that there’s always room for improvement.”
 The Canton PD, he said, has always had to be willing to update and adjust policies based on state standards, with “wiggle room” for policy items the department wants to address, too.
 Since the October reaccreditation, Canton PD’s use of force policy is required to be posted online and is viewable on the municipal website. Updated March 26, with a scheduled reevaluation date in March 2023, Canton PD’s use of force policy “recognizes and respects the value and special integrity of each human life.”
 “In vesting police officers with the lawful authority to use force to protect the public welfare, a careful balancing of all human interests is required,” the policy reads in part. “Therefore, it is the policy of this department that police officers shall use only that force that is reasonably necessary to effectively bring an incident (i.e. arrest, prevent from escape) under control based on the extent and type of resistance encountered, while protecting the lives of the officer and others.”
 The state’s banning of neck restraints stems from the 2014 killing of Eric Garner, who died in Staten Island after a New York City Police Department officer put him in a chokehold while other officers pinned him down. The NYPD banned chokeholds in 1993.
 Last month, Mr. Floyd died after then-Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin knelt on his neck for eight minutes and 46 seconds during an apparent arrest. Two minutes and 53 seconds of that neck restraint occurred after Mr. Floyd was unresponsive, according to the initial Minnesota District Court criminal complaint filed against Chauvin. Minneapolis City Council, in conjunction with the Minnesota Department of Human Rights, banned the use of chokeholds June 5.
 Already included in Canton PD’s use of force policy prior to the state’s mandate, neck holds are a prohibited use of force for Canton officers, as the policy states “members and employees shall refrain from applying any carotid restraint techniques.”
 Canton PD lacks an official crowd management policy, a deficiency expected to be addressed in the department’s reviews this year.
 “We’ve been part of a number of small protests through the years, and our policy has always been to be helpful, to help people cross the streets, to help everybody be safe on any side of the issue,” Mr. Santimaw said.
 The state’s Police Reform and Reinvention Collaborative also requires law enforcement agency plans to involve implicit bias training to increase individual self-awareness about unconsciously harboring stereotypes and unequitable attitudes about identities, particularly racial and gender identities.
 Mr. Santimaw told the village board all Canton PD officers have completed implicit bias training, an expectation the department has had “for many years.” Most of Canton PD’s officers will complete an additional bias course at SUNY Canton this week, he said, with remaining officers attending a similar training in the coming weeks.
 “We shop in the local stores and we are part of the community too,” Mr. Santimaw said. “We want to be able to go to the grocery store and keep our head held high. We want to do what we can do to make this right.”
 Village Mayor Michael E. Dalton said the review process will have “several layers” to it.
 “We will go through the process of this executive order, there’s no question about it,” he said. “All that will be coming down the road, and we’ll make sure that everybody has the opportunity to participate. That’s the point of it.”

GLEN ALPINE — The newest eatery in the town of Glen Alpine has a familiar format and food, but also a few unique twists and tastes along the way.
 Alpine Burrito has been in business for about a month now, rolling onto Main Street and rolling up burritos for what the restaurant’s co-owners describe as a rapidly growing customer base.
 The Mexican-style restaurant, located at 500 W. Main St. across from Thrifty Mart and co-owned by locals Jamie Freeman and Jessica Wright, offers more than burritos. Some of the daily specials offered so far include stuffed peppers, arroz con pollo, tostadas, quesadillas, tacos, taquitos, enchiladas and more.
