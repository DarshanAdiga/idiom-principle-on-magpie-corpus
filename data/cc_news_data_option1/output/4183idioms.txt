The 355 does look like it will be an entertaining movie that will make the point that men war and are insanely aggressive and that women are essentially trying to make the world a better place. As far as entertainment value goes it could be pretty interesting since the like many stories it does have implications that are worldwide and focus on neutralizing a threat before it becomes too great to deal with. The movie also features what looks to be a great cast that should be able to work together in a way that will be convincing and possibly make it apparent that these women do have lives beyond their mission, as it's already been shown. The day of the damsel in distress is pretty much over and to be honest, good riddance. But the balance that needs to be struck so continuously is still wobbling now and then as it appears in many movies, as some projects are able to show a definite balance between men and women when it comes to sharing the load of pulling off a movie. Maybe there's a lot more that we're not seeing in the trailer, but right now the idea is that women are paying homage to 355, which is definitely a positive look on the role of women when it comes to espionage. The hope is that the movie will focus on the problem that the team being assembled is meant to deal with, and focus less on the idea that women can one-up men. Like it or not, this is true, but ramming the point down the throats of the audience is a sure way to make it backfire in a big way.

March 7, 1915 – October 9, 2020 On Friday, October 9, 2020, our beautiful mother, grandmother, great grandmother, Muriel Jessie Kropelin (previously Bylund) (nee Fulton), passed away peacefully with her family by her side at the amazing age of 105 (and a half!). Muriel was born on March 7, 1915 in Fort Frances, Ontario to Margaret and Leland Fulton. She had one brother George. After high school she attended Teachers College in North Bay, graduating in 1933. She taught at many rural schools in northern Ontario, all grades and subjects in conditions unheard of in today's standards. Muriel married John Bylund in 1936 and worked full time as a teacher while they ran a farm and raised two children, Jack and Sharon. In the late 60's she retired from teaching in Fort Frances. She and John purchased the Stanley Hotel where Muriel served the customers and entertained singing, playing the piano and accordion. When they sold the hotel, they moved to Wabigoon. When John passed away Muriel moved back to Fort Frances. In 1980 she married Fred Kropelin and the two spent many happy years fishing and travelling, spending winters in Bonita Springs, Florida. After Fred's passing, she moved to Thunder Bay and lived in Patterson Apartments for over 20 years. She continued to travel to Florida where she met Jim Harris, with whom she also shared a special relationship. (When you live to be 105 you can accumulate a few husbands!) At 100 years of age, she moved to Chartwell Isabella, and then to her final home at Southbridge Pinewood. Muriel was intelligent, independent, hardworking, happy, positive and FUN! Family gatherings and celebrating special occasions were very important. She loved being with people. Not surprising, throughout her life Muriel had many close girlfriends including the ladies at Patterson Apartments and in her exercise class. When asked her secret to a long healthy life she would say “Eat your vegetables, keep moving and always look on the bright side.” She was a member of First Wesley United Church, the United Church Women and the Retired Teachers of Ontario. She was also a dedicated volunteer at the Food Bank, the Regional Hospital, Grandview Lodge, 55 Plus Centre Visitor program and knitted for the Red Cross for many years. We extend our heartfelt thank you and appreciation to the staff at Blue Heron at Southbridge Pinewood. When we could not be with her over the past six months, we felt some relief knowing how good she was cared for while she was there. Muriel will be missed by her children Jack (Elaine) Bylund and Sharon (Mike) Turick; grandchildren Karen (Jerry) Amanda and Jared Mercier, John (Brandy) Braiden, Kaylee, Jack and Dana Bylund, Vicki (Terry) Shaun and Jennifer Ewacha, Carolyn (Kevin) and Cameron Charlton, Darcey (Marc) Zachary, Xander and Isabelle Bourgeois, Lori (Matt) Tristan and Mia Heibert, Lisa Sparrow (Ben) Lucas, Sophie and Jacob; her step sons Fred and Harvey Kropelin and their families; and many nieces and nephews. Per Muriel's wishes, cremation has taken place and a private family service was held. She will rest at the Riverside Cemetery in Fort Frances, Ontario. Arrangements have been entrusted to WESTFORT FUNERAL CHAPEL, 420 West Gore Street at James. If friends desire, memorial donations could be made to the Shelter House, or a charity of your choice. We loved you Muriel. Cheers to a great life! You were an inspiration to everyone! Please sign the online condolences ateverestofthunderbay.com

Host Fordson went on to make it three in row, and four straight over Dearborn, with an 18-0 win in Friday's matchup.
 Per Michigan-Football.com, Fordson (3-2, 3-2 KLAA East) improved to 31-12 all- time against the Pioneers (2-3, 2-3 KLAA East), going back to 1950. The Tractors' four-game win streak over the Pioneers matches their longest such streak in the series since doing so from 2010-12. The two schools have met at least once every year since 1997, including some seasons with an encounter in the state playoffs.
 All of the scoring on Friday came in the first half.
 On the opening drive the Tractors’ Kiem Moore, filling in for injured tailback Travis Boston Jr, helped engineer his team downfield. Moore cashed in from four yards out and a successful 2-point try made it an 8-0 lead early.
 Midway through the second, Dearborn was driving and got into a 1st-and-goal situation inside the Fordson 10-yard line. However, a Pioneer fumble was scooped by Fordson’s Mohammed Sayed and he took it 92 yards the other way for a touchdown and gave the hosts a 15-0 lead.
 Unfortunately for Dearborn, it was one of several missed opportunities on Friday night.
 Later in the period, Dearborn turned it over on downs in the red zone with about four minutes to go. That allowed for the Tractors to march down the field once more and set up Hadi Saad with a 45-yard field goal try. Saad drilled it as time expired, giving the Tractors an 18-0 lead going into halftime.
 Fortunately for the home team, that was all the scoring it needed in the contest. Although they never really garnered any more significant scoring chances, defensively the Tractors stepped up in some key moments when Dearborn was in position to make things interesting.
 "I think we're getting better, we're improving," said Fordson coach Fouad Zaban. "You got to give (Dearborn) credit, they fought real hard. I think our conditioning showed a little bit today. We have guys that play both sides and they do, as well. I would say up until the fourth quarter, I was pretty happy with us not responding to any of the garbage."


--DocBreak--
Zaban applauded the way both Moore and quarterback Alex Osman played throughout the game, also crediting his offensive linemen for creating holes for Moore to run through.
 In addition to the fumble returned for a score and turnover on downs that led to a field goal, Dearborn squandered a number of other chances. Two more times the Pioneers turned the ball over on downs. One came in the third after an interception deep in Tractor territory, however, a subsequent personal foul penalty pushed Dearborn back towards midfield where the drive eventually stalled.
 Another turnover came after getting set up inside the Fordson 5-yard line. But a botched snap over the head of quarterback Ali Murray, coupled with another personal foul call, pushed Dearborn back into a goal-to-go situation from 30+ yards out.
 Pioneers coach John Powell knows there were opportunities to be had.
 "That fumble play was a big one," Powell said. "I think there may have been some miscommunication. Ali is a good runner, but (Fordson) just made a nice play and stripped it out. I would remind you that we are a young team. But we had the ball three times inside their 10-yard line and scored zero points.
 "You can't do that against a quality team and expect to win."
 Powell credited his defensive unit for their toughness and keeping the Fordson offense largely in check. He reaffirmed the importance of needing to find ways to score in those aforementioned moments and also talked of managing emotions and game plan during a big rivalry game.
 "Everything seemingly becomes a pressure situation," Powell said. "Bottom line though is we have to execute, we just have to. We're playing well, we're doing a lot of things well, but we're just not executing (in the red zone). I have to find a way to fix that."
 Both teams will wrap up the six-game regular season on Friday, Oct. 23. It is typically the week where the KLAA conducts crossover matchups, but teams around the league will play their previously scheduled Week 3 opponent.
 For Dearborn, it signals a date at home with Livonia Franklin (2-3), which fell 56-0 against Belleville on Friday. Fordson will host Wayne Memorial (0-5), which lost 63-36 to rival Westland John Glenn in Week 5.

Telling the story is a huge part of making a successful movie, and its where a lot of stories tend to fling themselves off the rails, since far too often trying to make a personal or biased point is what will unseat a movie from the course that it needs to take to be entertaining. Some people are out to make a point and to make people listen instead of pandering to the audience, as many see it, but telling the story is usually the best idea, even if one of the intended messages might not be picked up by a good number of people. If that's a concern, then it's important to find a way to be unique, individual, and to tell a story that people haven't seen before. The downfall of any espionage movie is that the audience has seen it in so many different ways over the years that trying to come up with a story that will knock their socks off means more money, more research, and more over the top effects and plot lines than many people are capable of thinking about. The 355 looks entertaining so far in the same manner as many espionage movies, but with women as the protagonists. I really don't like saying any story looks generic and in need of a wow factor, but it's a big hope that a stunning review will be coming after watching this movie.

The Balkan Insight (fornerkt the Balkin Investigative Reporting Network, BIRN) is a close group of editors and trainers that enables journalists in the region to produce in-depth analytical and investigative journalism on complex political, economic and social themes. BIRN emerged from the Balkan programme of the Institute for War & Peace Reporting, IWPR, in 2005. The original IWPR Balkans team was mandated to localise that programme and make it sustainable, in light of changing realities in the region and the maturity of the IWPR intervention. Since then, its work in publishing, media training and public debate activities has become synonymous with quality, reliability and impartiality. A fully-independent and local network, it is now developing as an efficient and self-sustainable regional institution to enhance the capacity for journalism that pushes for public debate on European-oriented political and economic reform.

This is where we get honest, here. Laugh lines are notoriously difficult to treat because of their complex nature. First off, they are not _just_ caused by collagen and elastin depletion—they’re also influenced by bone and fat loss in the face and cheeks. While you can certainly find topicals to help support the former two, there are no topicals to encourage bone or fat growth.
 Then there’s the movement part: They are formed as the result of laughing, talking, and smiling. Imagine a life without those? No thanks—we’ll take a few extra folds. Our experts agree—the aim here isn’t “fixing” them, it’s simply softening their appearance as we get older.  
 “Laugh lines are inevitable and a natural part of the face so they should never be completely diminished. When you look at babies all of them have nasolabial folds. Instead we can try to prevent folds from deepening,“ says Masur.

Two two days later she found her car and her signs vandalized.“I thought about getting new signs, so I decided no I’ll just leave these spray painted ones up and let people see what a Trump supporter did. That is a good typical Christian Trump supporter," Gibbons said.“No this is the behavior of a classic criminal," Tom Fredericks said.Tom Fredericks with the Morgan County Republican Executive Committee says this type of behavior is not okay.“It’s an indication of how far we’ve polarized politics in America and I don’t like it. I think we need to come together. We need to recognize political differences, but at the end of the day, we’re Americans," Gibbons said.Fredericks says the problem isn’t one sided. He tells us over 500 Trump signs have been stolen out of yards in Morgan County this election cycle.Gibbons says she filed a police report with the Sheriff’s Office, and a local auto shop removed the paint for free.“It is a crime and we will try to prosecute when we can find whoever did it,” Mike Swafford said.Public information officer Mike Swafford says the person responsible will be arrested, brought to jail and charged with a misdemeanor.Copyright 2020 WAFF.

HUTCHINS, Raimonde "Rai" Born June 6, 1923 Passed away October 12, 2020 We would like to say goodbye to an amazing woman - Rai Hutchins. Mom had a life of adventure with her husband Eric for 40 years. After WWII, two city kids successfully started a dairy farm in North Devon then emigrated to Canada with seven kids in 1957. After adding two more children in Calgary they then moved to Mill Bay in 1965. With Eric's passing in 1982 Mom continued to farm her ten acres for another 35 years, only giving up breeding sheep when she was 88. She became the matriarch to nine children and their spouses, twenty-three grandchildren, thirty great-grandchildren, two great-great-grandchildren, and a very large extended loving family. Mom was born to privilege and wealth but when the need arose she soon turned her hand to what was needed becoming an ambulance driver during the London Blitz, milker, most excellent cook, farmer, tutor, seamstress, knitter, card player, curler, friend and always an avid reader. She raised nine children to be not only family minded, but to be community minded, and to lend a hand to all when needed and all with a sense of humour. Her house was remodeled to handle as many as eighty-five for sit down dinners for Christmas, Easter and Thanksgiving feasts with room always for family friends. Mom also hosted family weddings for two of her grandchildren. Her nine children, Jane, Sue, Andy, Kitty, Felicity, Simon, Rob, Tina and Fiona, and their families would like to wish Rai many many thanks for a life well lived and to send her on her way to her next adventure with their love surrounding her. Bless you mom. Condolences may be sent to www.firstmemorialduncan.com

ROBERT ANDREW MACKENZE MELDRUM (Bob) Sadly, Bob passed away on October 12, 2020 at the age of 82. Bob's partner Dale and his children Samantha and Gregory Meldrum who came in from Vancouver, were at his side. Many in the Duntroon, Glen Huron, Singhampton, Stayner community will remember Bob's love of life through his one of a kind gruff, humorous, say it like it is style. Bob was born in Toronto and lived there until the 1990's when he and Dale decided to leave the city behind and make his beloved Hill Haven Farm in Duntroon their permanent home. Country life transformed him and his love of his shorthorn cattle, fixing fences, zipping around the fields in his rtv and especially hobnobbing with his neighbours and local merchants - those were his true joys. Bob will be lovingly remembered by his Hill Haven 'family' \- Matt, Matt, Sami and Sam. His fellow shorthorn breeders across Canada will fondly remember his cigar chomping, larger than life presence at all big cattle shows and sales. In just a couple of decades he and Dale developed a prominent purebred shorthorn herd known all over North America and Bob's name will be synonymous with Hill Haven's legacy cow Breathless and bull FireStorm. His pride in his shorthorns and his farm was felt by everyone. Prior to country life, Bob owned and operated Meldrum Meat Packers in Toronto and enjoyed skiing and sailing. In the winter he spent every weekend at Blue Mountain and every free waking moment in the summer was spent racing his sailboat on Lake Ontario out of the National Yacht Club. There are too many special friends to mention but they know who they are. There is no funeral or memorial service, however at some time in the future at his request there will be "one hell of a good wake" at the farm. No flowers, cards. Donations may be made to Collingwood Marine and General Hospital. Friends may visit Bob's online Book of Memories at www.fawcettfuneralhomes.com

Katherine Langford “copped an entire bucket” of fake blood while filming her latest comedy Spontaneous.
 The 13 Reasons Why actress stars alongside Charlie Plummer in the coming-of- age romantic comedy, which is set in the middle of a pandemic in which high school seniors are spontaneously combusting at random.
 In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, the Australian star revealed it was a very messy shoot, with her ending up looking like Carrie, who is drenched in blood at a school prom in the horror of the same name, during one scene.
 “(The blood is) a delightful mixture of corn syrup, food dye and something else. I have to give props to our prop department because they created different kinds and consistencies of blood syrup,” she explained. “Part of that came down to (writer/director) Brian (Duffield) too since we use explosions in a number of ways in this film. I think there was a lot of research into how things spray, and they had to go through different tests whether it was sprayed, cannoned or whatever.
 “So they had an array of bloods, and there’s one scene where it just came from a bucket. I don’t think I was supposed to, but I did cop probably an entire bucket of blood in a very Carrie-esque moment. So let’s just say it was a very messy clean-up and a very messy shoot.”
 The Knives Out star acknowledged that when she made the film in early 2018, she couldn’t have imagined the parallels it would have with the Covid-19 pandemic.
 “The world is a very different place now in terms of the film’s relevancy, and no one expected how close to home it would hit,” she added.
 Spontaneous is available on demand now.

OK, so with advice we are certainly not telling you to limit your precious smiles and laughs. Those are an important part of life—and mental health is skin health. However, being mindful of how you move and rest your face can help your facial tissues and muscles in the long run—in the same way you are likely mindful of your bodily movements.  
 For example, you can give face yoga a try, which involves simple targeted movements, poses, and stretches to strengthen your facial muscles for a tighter, more toned skin. And, much like you are mindful of rest and recovery, you should consider how you are holding your face when not actively engaging. “Avoiding unnecessary facial expressions is another method,” says Masur. “Of course live your life to the fullest, but if you are at home resting the muscles on your face helps, especially when throughout the day the mouth is in constant motion.”

A recent flare-up in hostilities between Azerbaijan and Armenia in the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region has drawn in Turkey, who has thrown its political and diplomatic weight behind Baku, a fellow Turkic-dominated state who benefits from Turkish-made drones in the ongoing conflict. Ankara has also shipped Syrian mercenaries to the Azerbaijani side to tip the scales against archenemy Armenia, although it denies doing so. This escalation has likely irked Russia, who is not only the traditional regional power broker, but also maintains a security pact with Armenia. On October 10th, Russia brokered a tenuous ceasefire that lasted less than 24 hours. Shortly thereafter Turkey issued a statement calling on Armenia to completely withdraw from the Nagorno- Karabakh region as a precondition for peace talks.

 "They had these masks where they put spices in the nose and had a big beak," Pearson said. "It was like a gas mask with their version of a filter."
 Pearson hoped participants would resist ripping off their facial coverings off at the first opportunity.
 "We would rather you err on the side of wearing a mask," Pearson said. "This is going to be an occasion where you are going to be around a lot of people. Besides, Halloween is a perfect time to wear a mask."
 Pearson noted that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) was reminding people that the mask which came with a costume stored in their closet is probably not an effective barrier.
 Similarly, the CDC is advising against wearing an anti-virus covering with a conventional mask. A good facial covering incorporated into a costume, like a ninja warrior, would be ideal.
 Lewisburg Mayor Judy Wagner said the official borough hours for trick-or- treating would be abandoned this year in favor of the Mask-a-Rade. Task Force members employed out-of-the-box thinking in coming up with the plan which Wagner hoped would serve as an example of the right steps to take.
 Partners also included the Lewisburg Children's Museum (LCM) and Lewisburg Area School District Parent Student Association.
 Wheeler said the LCM planned to set up a tent and be the starting point for a "promenade" along Market Street. Participants may pick up candy bags at Hufnagle Park then continue for another giveaway at the end. Spooky characters will serve as marshals along the way.

ROBERT ANDREW MACKENZE MELDRUM (Bob) Sadly, Bob passed away on October 12, 2020 at the age of 82. Bob's partner Dale and his children Samantha and Gregory Meldrum who came in from Vancouver, were at his side. Many in the Duntroon, Glen Huron, Singhampton, Stayner community will remember Bob's love of life through his one of a kind gruff, humorous, say it like it is style. Bob was born in Toronto and lived there until the 1990's when he and Dale decided to leave the city behind and make his beloved Hill Haven Farm in Duntroon their permanent home. Country life transformed him and his love of his shorthorn cattle, fixing fences, zipping around the fields in his rtv and especially hobnobbing with his neighbours and local merchants - those were his true joys. Bob will be lovingly remembered by his Hill Haven 'family' - Matt, Matt, Sami and Sam. His fellow shorthorn breeders across Canada will fondly remember his cigar chomping, larger than life presence at all big cattle shows and sales. In just a couple of decades he and Dale developed a prominent purebred shorthorn herd known all over North America and Bob's name will be synonymous with Hill Haven's legacy cow Breathless and bull FireStorm. His pride in his shorthorns and his farm was felt by everyone. Prior to country life, Bob owned and operated Meldrum Meat Packers in Toronto and enjoyed skiing and sailing. In the winter he spent every weekend at Blue Mountain and every free waking moment in the summer was spent racing his sailboat on Lake Ontario out of the National Yacht Club. There are too many special friends to mention but they know who they are. There is no funeral or memorial service, however at some time in the future at his request there will be "one hell of a good wake" at the farm. No flowers, cards. Donations may be made to Collingwood Marine and General Hospital. Friends may visit Bob's online Book of Memories at www.fawcettfuneralhomes.com

HUTCHINS, Raimonde "Rai" Born June 6, 1923 Passed away October 12, 2020 We would like to say goodbye to an amazing woman - Rai Hutchins. Mom had a life of adventure with her husband Eric for 40 years. After WWII, two city kids successfully started a dairy farm in North Devon then emigrated to Canada with seven kids in 1957. After adding two more children in Calgary they then moved to Mill Bay in 1965. With Eric's passing in 1982 Mom continued to farm her ten acres for another 35 years, only giving up breeding sheep when she was 88. She became the matriarch to nine children and their spouses, twenty-three grandchildren, thirty great-grandchildren, two great-great- grandchildren, and a very large extended loving family. Mom was born to privilege and wealth but when the need arose she soon turned her hand to what was needed becoming an ambulance driver during the London Blitz, milker, most excellent cook, farmer, tutor, seamstress, knitter, card player, curler, friend and always an avid reader. She raised nine children to be not only family minded, but to be community minded, and to lend a hand to all when needed and all with a sense of humour. Her house was remodeled to handle as many as eighty-five for sit down dinners for Christmas, Easter and Thanksgiving feasts with room always for family friends. Mom also hosted family weddings for two of her grandchildren. Her nine children, Jane, Sue, Andy, Kitty, Felicity, Simon, Rob, Tina and Fiona, and their families would like to wish Rai many many thanks for a life well lived and to send her on her way to her next adventure with their love surrounding her. Bless you mom. Condolences may be sent to www.firstmemorialduncan.com
