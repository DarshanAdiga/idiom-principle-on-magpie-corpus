A 72-year-old British man has claimed a double world record after becoming the oldest person to row solo across the Atlantic Ocean.


  Graham Walters, from Leicester, England, arrived in Antigua on Wednesday, three months after departing from Gran Canaria island in Spain in a plywood boat he built in his front yard.


  Walters is also the oldest person to row across an ocean more than once. The gruelling 3,000-mile (5,000 km) challenge was his fifth Atlantic crossing -- and his last, he says.


  "This trip really is about the boat which I built 22 years ago. That boat has been with me three times across the Atlantic before this, so it’s getting old, like me. I thought, 'why not be the oldest person to row the Atlantic with an old boat?'" he said.


  Escorted in by local Coast Guard boats to the sound of blaring horns in honor of his achievement, Walters stumbled as he took his first shaky steps on land after more than 90 days at sea.


  And despite being keen to be reunited with wife Jean, whom he had married just a month before his departure, Walters will have to remain in Antigua until travel restrictions are lifted. All commercial flights in and out of the Caribbean island have been suspended because of the coronavirus pandemic.


  Walters visited a gym daily to get fit for the journey. He rowed a punishing two hours on, two hours off each day.


  After three months of surviving on boil-in-the-bag meals –- plus a stash of chocolate he took with him as treats –- Walters said he couldn’t wait to tuck into an English staple, roast beef and Yorkshire pudding, with a glass of red wine.


  Walters’ feat has raised more than $3,000 for Help for Heroes, which assists British servicemen and women wounded in the line of duty.

There will be no handshakes, line judges, ball boys or spectators allowed, but tennis fans can get their fix from Friday when a series of exhibition matches will be streamed live from a rural German venue.


  Due to the coronavirus pandemic, the ATP and WTA Tours are suspended until July 13 at the earliest.


  However, tennis fans can enjoy live coverage of an eight-man tournament at the Base Tennis Academy in the tiny town of Hoehr-Grenzhausen, near Koblenz.


  Germany's Dustin Brown, who famously beat Rafael Nadal in the second round of Wimbledon in 2015, is the best known name in the field, none of whom are ranked in world's top 100.


  Compatriot Yannick Hanfmann, 28, will be the highest ranked player at 143.


  "I'm really excited about it," Hanfmann told AFP subsidiary SID.


  The academy's courts are already equipped with cameras and the matches will be streamed worldwide.


  Due to coronavirus, only the two players and chair umpire will be allowed on the clay courts at any one time.


  Digital broadcaster Tennis Channel, which has 62 million subscribers in the USA alone, will broadcast the three-legs of the tournament, on Friday and then May 7 and May 14.


  "It's pretty cool, I'm curious to see how many people will be watching," admitted Hanfmann.


  When the coronavirus pandemic first hit Germany in mid-March, Hanfmann spent time at home in Karlsruhe, seeing his family and girlfriend, "whom I usually don't see so often and for so long at a stretch".


  However, now "I miss the tingling, the competition", even if only a few hundred euros of prize money will be at stake.


  Hanfmann will have free board and lodgings at the academy.


  He is just about managing to make ends meet, having earned 543,000 dollars in prize money during his career.


  "I have built up a few savings and I am not one to throw money away," he added.


  "But things are getting tight now."


  However, he does not think much of the idea by superstars Novak Djokovic, Nadal and Roger Federer that the top 100-ranked players pay into a fund to provide financial support for low ranking players.


  "Why should the players below the top ten be responsible for making others feel better?" he asked.

The layoffs amount to 1 in 6 American workers and encompass more people than the entire population of Texas. Some economists say that when the unemployment rate for April comes out next week, it could be as high as 20% — a figure not seen since the Depression of the 1930s, when joblessness peaked at 25%.
 And the number of job losses could be even higher than the unemployment claims would suggest, because some people did not apply and others couldn't get through to their states' overwhelmed systems. A poll by two economists found that the U.S. may have lost 34 million jobs.
 “This is the saddest day for the global economy we have ever seen” in the 50 years that economists at High Frequency Economics have been following economic data, they wrote in a report.
 The virus has killed more than 220,000 people worldwide, including 61,000 in the U.S., according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. Confirmed infections globally topped 3.2 million, including 1 million in the U.S., but the true numbers are believed to be much higher because of limited testing, differences in counting the dead and concealment by some governments.
 In other developments:
 — Dr. Anthony Fauci, the U.S. government’s top infectious-diseases expert, said he expects federal approval for the first drug to prove effective against the coronavirus to happen “really quickly.” Remdesivir, made by California's Gilead Sciences, hastened the recovery of COVID-19 patients in a major government study, and it might also have reduced deaths, according to Fauci.
 — A 1,000-bed Navy hospital ship that arrived in New York City to great fanfare a month ago was set to leave after treating just 182 patients, because the surge of cases has fallen short of the doomsday predictions. The 24-hour number of deaths in New York state was reported at 306, the lowest in a month.
 — With signs that the outbreak has stabilized in places around the U.S., President Donald Trump said he would not extend the White House’s social- distancing guidelines past their expiration Thursday. Those guidelines encouraged Americans to work from home and avoid restaurants, group gatherings and nonessential travel.
 There was also bleak new data in Europe, where more than 130,000 people with the virus have died. The economy in the 19 countries using the euro shrank 3.8% in the first quarter of the year, the biggest contraction since the eurozone countries began keeping joint statistics in 1995.
 France’s economy shrank an eye-popping 5.8%, the biggest quarterly drop since 1949. In Spain, the contraction was 5.2%. Germany is projecting that its economy, the eurozone’s biggest, will shrink 6.3% this year.
 Joblessness in Europe has reached 7.4%, the statistics agency Eurostat reported. However, big job-protection programs are temporarily keeping millions of Europeans on payrolls, sparing them the record-setting flood of layoffs that is battering the U.S.

Silicon Valley billionaires Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg offered dueling views on lockdown measures designed to slow the spread of the coronavirus on Wednesday, with Facebook's Zuckerberg endorsing the measures while Tesla's Musk condemned them as anti-democratic.Musk, who has often made outspoken and even inflammatory comments on conference calls and on Twitter, said in comments to analysts on Tesla Inc's earnings call that it was "fascist" to say people cannot leave their homes."This is not democratic, this is not freedom. Give people back their goddamn freedom," Musk said. FREE AMERICA NOW&mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 29, 2020 Zuckerberg, on the other hand, in comments on Facebook's own earnings calls, expressed concerns about easing lockdown measure and said the economic fallout from the pandemic would last longer than people are currently anticipating. "I worry that reopening certain places too quickly before infection rates have been reduced to very minimal levels will almost guarantee future outbreaks and worse longer-term health and economic outcomes," he said.Both companies are based in the San Francisco Bay area, which was out front in trying to slow the virus' spread, with the region's seven counties issuing a joint shelter-in-place order before California issued a statewide order.Electric carmaker Tesla and social media network Facebook have had different experiences under the lockdown. Tesla had initially resisted efforts by California authorities to shut its plant in the Bay Area under the lockdown, until agreeing on March 19 to suspend production. Even so, Tesla on Wednesday reported its third profitable quarter in a row.Facebook, the world's largest social network, on Wednesday said usage rose during the first quarter amid the widespread lockdowns, although ad revenue plunged in March.Musk did not mince words in criticizing the lockdowns."So the extension of the shelter-in-place or, frankly, I would call it, forcibly imprisoning people in their homes against all their constitutional rights, in my opinion, breaking people's freedoms in ways that are horrible and wrong and not why people came to America or built this country," Musk said, swearing to underscore his point."It will cause great harm, not just to Tesla, but to any companies. And while Tesla will weather the storm, there are many small companies that will not," he said.Zuckerberg and Musk, who is also chief executive of rocket company SpaceX, have had differences in the past. In 2017, a war of words broke out between the duo over whether robots will become smart enough to kill their human creators. "I've talked to Mark about this. His understanding of the subject is limited." Musk tweeted at the time about Zuckerberg, who downplayed Musk's warnings about the danger of artificial intelligence.In May 2018, Musk made waves on another earnings call when he refused to analysts' questions, saying that "boring, bonehead questions are not cool." He later apologized for his remarks.

“There was a time when Wake Forest was always in the NCAA Tournament, and we have to get back to those days,” Francis said, referring to a streak of postseason appearances from 1991 through 2006.


  Francis watched the ACC Network's replay this week of third-ranked Wake Forest beating top-ranked Duke at Joel Coliseum in 2009.


  "The place was packed and I watched that game again, and I was both sad and happy about it," Francis said. "We can get back to that again where we sell out games for basketball."


  Pete Rose, a Winston-Salem resident and diehard Wake Forest fan, posted on Twitter about the hiring of Forbes.


  "Steve Forbes is a home run hire for Wake, dude is gonna crush it here!!"


  Chip Crutchfield, 50, and his family have been long-time Wake Forest season ticket holders. Chip's late father, Ken, first bought season tickets in football when BB&T Field opened in the late 1960s.


  Chip, a ball boy for the Deacons from 1980 to '84, is hoping the basketball program can turn the corner under Forbes.


  "Somebody is going to have to come in and connect with the students and get the fans excited," Crutchfield said. "You've had so much disappointment and dissatisfaction with the fan base it has to change. It's tough to look over at the student section and there's like 100 students there and that's it."


  Crutchfield said he loves what John Currie, the athletics director, has done since being hired in March 2019.


  "He's sharp and I trust what he's done with the selection process and with how he had a list of six candidates that I saw in different articles," Crutchfield said. "I definitely think he did his due diligence and made the best decision."

What the recent exchanges have done is to expose Hindutva in its full nakedness and ugliness to the Gulf public. It has planted the first concerns that India might no longer be shaped by its traditional values, that the India they knew and cherished is perhaps withering away before their very eyes.

Deals on the most popular cars will be hard to come by because car manufacturers shuttered production.
 "The customer is going to have to be satiated with kind of taking what they can find on a dealer's lot as we don't have a lot of inventory in the pipeline," he said.
 Chris Murray of Alta Corp Capital said buyers should shop around for good opportunities, particularly for 2019 vehicles, less popular brands and smaller vehicles.
 "I don't know if I would want to come out and broad brush say everybody's going to fire sale everything," said the analyst covering Auto Canada Inc.
 "I think what we're going to see is there'll be opportunities in certain types of vehicles. And given what we've seen so far, the dealerships that survive this downturn, they're going to be pretty eager to try to get some transactions done."
 They'll offer incentives while car manufacturers will also step up with their own discounts.
 So far, Ford of Canada is providing up to six months of payment relief on new purchases of 2019 and 2020 Ford and Lincoln models financed through Ford Credit. Existing customers can get up to 90 days of financing or lease payment extensions.
 FCA says it is waiving payments for 120 days on all 2019 and 2020 models for all of its brands.
 The luxury business could face increased pressure, as Karwel said the shift away from leasing could produce better purchase incentives than were available last year.
 "So I think for sure, there will be better opportunities for customers that wish to finance a luxury car at this point."
 Fears of a recession could be a bigger threat to the industry than the virus. Demand would wane with potential customers less likely to commit to a purchase if they don't have jobs.
 Manufacturers will then be less inclined to put big incentives on cars because their ability to attract customers will be limited, he said.
 "When the market is contracting, you're not looking at car manufacturers to try to gain share by increasing incentives, they will pull incentives back to a certain extent to preserve profitability."
 This report by The Canadian Press was first published April 30, 2020.

The Premier League wrote to the US government in February urging it to keep Saudi Arabia on a watchlist because it said the country "remained a centre for piracy".


  The revelation comes as the league considers a takeover of Newcastle which would reportedly involve the Saudi Public Investment Fund (PIF) taking an 80 percent stake in the club.


  Prospective new owners must pass the Premier League's owners and directors' test, one strand of which relates to criminal activity.


  The league has come under pressure from rights group Amnesty International and the fiancee of murdered dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi to block the takeover due to Saudi Arabia's poor record on human rights.


  The Premier League's actions in relation to the takeover are also under scrutiny because it has previously been a critic of pirate broadcaster beoutQ, which operates out of Saudi Arabia.


  Qatar-based BeIN accuses Saudi of masterminding the pirate broadcasting of BeIN output, which includes Premier League games, as part of a spat between Doha and Riyadh. The Saudis deny the claims.


  In a letter from the league to the Office of the US Trade Representative (USTR) dated February 5 of this year, the Premier League complain about a "failure to take action" against the pirates by the Saudi government itself.


  "Saudi Arabia remains a centre of piracy, impacting rights-holders from around the world," the league's letter added.


  "In view of this long-standing situation, the Premier League respectfully requests that USTR maintain Saudi Arabia's position on the Priority Watch List."


  The USTR has kept Saudi Arabia on its watch list and confirmed in a report published on Wednesday: "The United States continues to remain concerned about reportedly high levels of online piracy in Saudi Arabia."

Professional football in Colombia could begin behind closed doors in August or September if other countries have success in restarting their own leagues, the country's Sports Minister said on Thursday. Ernesto Lucena, who 24 hours before acknowledged the return of games played in front of fans was unlikely this year, said officials were eager to get matches going again once health and safety guarantees are met amid the COVID-19 pandemic."The big question is when will the league start again and I don't want to be irresponsible but I'd say we can restart in August or September," Lucena told a Congressional commission in Bogota. "We hope to watch the examples of the other leagues to see how they act and we can follow their lead," he said in quotes reported on RCN Radio.One option being considered is playing the remaining league games in just one or two cities. His comments came a week after Colombian president Ivan Duque said even a return to games without spectators was not viable due to the large amount of testing that would be needed to protect the hundreds of support staff at clubs and stadiums.The South American nation is holding a nationwide quarantine until May 11 and has suspended all public events, including the main soccer leagues for both men and women. Colombia has confirmed 6,211 cases of COVID-19, with 278 deaths. (Writing by Andrew Downie in London Editing by Christian Radnedge)

The Italian airport operators association, Assaeroporti, said on Thursday proposals to keep some seats empty on planes for social distancing would not be workable if only imposed by Italy and would make the domestic sector vulnerable to foreign rivals. Italy, which has been hit harder by the coronavirus crisis than many countries, passed a decree last week stating social distancing should be applied in airports and on aircraft.The European Union's executive is expected to present a set of rules next month for the safe reopening of air travel when coronavirus lockdowns draw to an end, including social distancing in airports and on planes. No rules are yet in place. Airlines have raised concerns that such measures could blight profitability long after travel restrictions end."The social distancing on board of aircraft is not sustainable," Assaeroporti Vice President Vicar Fulvio Cavalleri said in a statement, adding that any measure imposed only by Italy would disrupt traffic to and from the country. Assaeroporti said the number of passengers travelling to and from Italy fell 85% year on year in March to 2.082 million.The Italian association said safety procedures around the world were not homogeneous and could cause disadvantages. "It is essential that the health prevention measures adopted in our country within airports and aircraft are consistent with those defined or in the process of being defined at international and European level," it said.The International Air Transport Association (IATA), which represents airlines around the world, has estimated the crisis could cost airlines $314 billion. Alitalia said it was already respecting social distancing on flights coming to Italy and would apply them on domestic flights starting from May 4.This would restrict the load factor on planes, a measure their capacity, to no more than 55%, it said. Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary has described proposals for planes to fly with empty middle seats after coronavirus travel restrictions end as "mad," saying they would be "hopelessly ineffective" and unaffordable.

Pfizer voiced hope Thursday it could roll out up to 20 million doses of a COVID-19 vaccine it is developing with German firm Biontech for emergency use by the end of 2020Pfizer.


  The two companies are working on four possible vaccines against the new coronavirus, and launched clinical trials using volunteers in Germany earlier this month.


  The head of the US pharma giant's vaccines unit, Nanette Cocero, told a virtual briefing Thursday that the companies were moving forward to ramp up clinical trials and manufacturing capabilities in parallel to be able to produce a large number of doses as soon as a vaccine is demonstrated to be safe and efficient.


  It can take years for a new vaccine to be licensed for general use, but in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, experimental vaccines shown to be safe and effective against the novel coronavirus could likely win approval for emergency use.


  The virus, which first surfaced in China late last year, has killed nearly 230,000 people and infected close to 3.2 million worldwide, according to a tally from official sources compiled by AFP.


  Assuming the safety and efficacy of one of the Pfizer-Biontech vaccine candidates is proven in clinical trials -- something Cocero said could happen "hopefully in the coming months" -- production will follow quickly.


  "We are looking to ramp up manufacturing rather quickly to have around 10 to 20 million doses by the end of this year," she said, adding that they would be available for "an emergency use type of setting."


  The World Health Organization has warned that developing and rolling out even an experimental vaccine could take 12 to 18 months, but companies are rushing to speed up the process.


  More than 100 labs around the world are scrambling to come up with a vaccine, but only seven are currently in clinical trials, according to the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.

Within the past six years, $33 million of taxpayer money has been approved for springs restoration projects in the Santa Fe River basin to save our Florida freshwater springs. The need for funding, according to the Suwannee River Water Management District, is to "replace and improve aging infrastructure, improve water quality and protect natural resources which ultimately affect our springs."
   
 More significantly, according to the district, "rural counties struggle to identify the financial resources needed to retrofit and update aging infrastructure."
   
 Our Florida Legislature has taken important steps to ensure that communities who recognize the last remaining drops of culturally significant freshwater systems are given every opportunity including financial relief to keep these springs alive and healthy. Equally significant is that the state has recognized that land use impacts are causing the need for the funding.
   
 At the recent April meeting of the Suwannee River district board, held by teleconference due to the current COVID-19 pandemic, several carefully vetted spring restoration projects were introduced that will be placed before the Florida Department of Environmental Protection for approval to protect our springs.
   
 Much-needed water quality projects included wastewater treatment in Fort White, High Springs and Trenton to improve water quality in the Santa Fe and Suwannee river basins. Land purchases for two conservation projects straddling the Santa Fe, which will ultimately protect high recharge of the Floridan Aquifer in the Devil's Ear Spring complex, included buying land around Sawdust Springs in Columbia County and nearly 2,800 acres in Gilchrist County.
   
 Interestingly, the Devil's Ear Spring complex (which includes Ginnie Springs) is the exact location Seven Springs Water Company has been drawing water from for over 20 years and wants to renew a permit to continue to draw up to 1,152,000 gallons of water daily for resale to Nestle Waters North America, or whoever.
   
 The total value of these five critical water quality and quantity projects is nearly $28 million with the majority coming from state funding with a small portion from a conservation group. This amounts to water quality and quantity efforts being paid for by your taxpayer dollars to ensure a first magnitude spring on the Santa Fe River has reduced nutrient loads and increased flows.
   
 At the same time, your state water management district staff, to their credit, is recommending to deny a water use permit for this water bottling operation. In response, the entities Nestle and Seven Springs Water Company have initiated litigation in hopes to continue to extract freshwater for their private profits and sales.
   
 Seven Springs has not proven the need for this water sufficiently for the Suwannee River Water Management District to issue the permit. Public interest prevails through the use of taxpayer dollars used to restore and maintain our springs and must not be countered by a permit that puts the Santa Fe River spring water into wasteful plastic bottles for corporate sales.
   
 Recharge of our Floridan Aquifer through conservation purchases and the removal of human nutrient loading are to be commended as we witness the last remaining vestiges of our natural Florida being wasted for human encroachment. A water bottling interest in this region of the Florida springs is wasteful and expensive to our taxpayers.
   
 In light of the current health pandemic, nature needs to be prioritized above human encroachment; important springs projects must be funded to save the last remaining freshwater sources to maintain quality, quantity and ecosystems. Bottling water directly from our protected springs is a frivolous pursuit compared to ensuring health and longevity for our Florida springs.

She got so frustrated that she even questioned his sexual orientation in a fit of rage. This sparked rumors among followers who started to wonder if Timothy was gay or transgender. Timothy shut down these rumors and denied all such claims. He said that he knew that he has a few feminine traits but that doesn't mean he is gay. He also confessed that sex wasn't so important to him than building a strong foundation was. Things got so bad that people asked him to get his testosterone levels checked.

NEW YORK - Police were called to a Brooklyn neighbourhood Wednesday after a funeral home overwhelmed by the coronavirus resorted to storing dozens of bodies on ice in rented trucks, and a passerby complained about the smell, officials said.


  Investigators who responded to a 911 call found that the home had rented four trucks to hold about 50 corpses, according to a law enforcement official. No criminal charges were brought and the official, who was not authorized to speak publicly about the investigation, spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.


  The Andrew T. Cleckley Funeral Home was cited for failing to control the odours. The home was able to obtain a larger, refrigerated truck later in the day, the official said.

Wake Forest made the official announcement this afternoon, with a news at conference scheduled for 11 a.m. Friday.


  “It’s a great day and I’m excited with this choice,” said Francis, who was an athletics director and basketball coach at Forsyth Country Day in the 1970s and early 1980s.


  Andrew Hano, 48, has been a season-ticket holder off and on for the last several years but was committed enough to continue to spend his $350 for two seats last season. He actually has shared three seats with a friend the last two seasons and admits it wasn’t always easy to go to games at Joel Coliseum, where the arena seats more than 14,000 but sometimes was half-empty.


  In the 2019-20 season, Wake Forest averaged 6,904 fans for 14 homes games.


  “I’m very excited,” said Hano, who is a project manager for a construction company. “From what I’ve read about him he’s been a winner at all levels, and he’ll be a breath of fresh air and while he’s probably not the same as the late (Skip Prosser) but I’m hearing he’s animated and colorful and really is a player’s coach.”


  Hano said Forbes, whose ETSU team won the Southern Conference and went 30-4 this season, might just be similar to Dave Clawson, Wake Forest’s football coach.


  “He will stick up for his guys and has enthusiasm on the sidelines and appears to be a real player’s coach,” Hano said.


  During the last 14 seasons, the Deacons have made the NCAA Tournament just three times, but Francis says establishing a consistent program has to be the No. 1 priority.

More than two dozen U.S. states moved ahead with plans to relax restrictions on business and social life, hoping to reverse the economic blows of the coronavirus that caused another 3.84 million Americans to file jobless claims last week. With White House guidelines for social distancing expiring on Thursday, states have been grappling with when and how to revive their economies while keeping residents safe with stay-at-home and social-distancing policies.Some states planned to ease restrictions without the "Opening Up America Again" safeguards that the White House itself had recommended, including declines in the infection rate and expanded virus testing. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and a White House task force member, warned states not to move too fast, a refrain of many public health officials since states, led by Georgia, started easing restrictions."You can't just leap over things to a situation where you're really tempting (the virus) to rebound. That's the thing I get concerned about. I hope they don't do that," he told NBC's "Today" show. The number of coronavirus cases is still climbing in many parts of the country, although peaks already have been reached in New York, the U.S. epicenter of the outbreak, and other places.Indiana, Massachusetts, Ohio and Pennsylvania reported record daily death tolls on Wednesday and the total number of U.S. deaths topped 61,000 with well over 1 million confirmed cases as of Thursday. The sense of urgency with which states were looking to reopen was highlighted on Thursday by Labor Department data showing that 3.839 million people filed claims for unemployment benefits in the week ended April 25.That was down from 4.442 million the prior week, but still lifted the number of people who sought unemployment benefits to around 30 million since March 21. That represents roughly 18.4% of the working age population. Data on Wednesday showed that the U.S. economy in the first quarter suffered its sharpest contraction since the 2007-2009 Great Recession.NEW INDUSTRIES HURT The numbers suggested that layoffs were spreading to industries not directly hurt at first by business closures and disruptions related to the coronavirus.Florida on Wednesday became the latest state, and one of the largest, to announce steps to ease restrictions that crippled business activity. "There is a light at the end of the tunnel," Governor Ron DeSantis said as he unveiled his phase-one plan due to start on Monday to relax mandatory workplace closures and stay-at-home orders imposed four weeks ago.Earlier in the week his Texas counterpart, Greg Abbott, another governor closely aligned with their fellow Republican, President Donald Trump, announced a similar reopening strategy due to take effect this Friday. In California, however, Governor Gavin Newsom was expected to announce the closure of all beaches and parks in the state after crowds jammed beaches last weekend, according to a memo seen by Reuters.A Democrat, Newsom has said that curbside retail, manufacturing and other "lower-risk workplaces" should reopen in California within weeks as testing and contact- tracing improve. In Michigan, Democratic Governor Gretchen Whitmer requested an extension to a state of emergency due to expire on Thursday. Republican lawmakers in Michigan oppose the extension.Hundreds of demonstrators, including militia group members carrying firearms and people with pro-Trump political signs, gathered on the steps of the Michigan state Capitol in protest against Whitmer's action. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said his state would hire thousands of people to trace the contacts of people who test positive for the coronavirus. He also announced a halt to New York City subway service from 1 to 5 a.m. to disinfect trains.Hospitalizations and deaths from the coronavirus declined slightly on Wednesday in New York, the worst hit of the 50 U.S. states with more than a third of all deaths. Fauci, the top U.S. infectious-disease official, shared more promising news on Gilead Sciences Inc's experimental antiviral drug remdesivir, which has shown an improved recovery rate for patients of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.Fauci said it was possible that millions of doses of the drug could be available by January as the Food and Drug Administration is reportedly set to grant emergency approval to remdesivir. “We want to go quickly, but we want to make sure it’s safe and it’s effective. I think that’s doable if things fall in the right place," Fauci said.
