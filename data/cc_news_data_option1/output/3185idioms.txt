Small businesses have seen a steady decline in revenues in recent weeks since the surge began. That’s not surprising given that half the country has halted its reopening plans and certain businesses, such as bars, have been forced to close again. But since the surge in cases is not expected to ease anytime soon, in fact, it’s expected to get worse in a few months, this could mean that suffering small businesses, who account for 50% to 60% of US jobs, might be in for a VERY tough fall/winter.

CINCINNATI (AP) — Streaking Salvador Perez had three more hits, including a homer and RBI double, Reds left-hander Wade Miley made another early exit after a misstep, and the Kansas City Royals beat Cincinnati 5-4 on Wednesday for their fifth victory in six games. The Royals' offense has led the way during the surge. It scored one run at a time to keep it going, led by Perez's homer, double and single. Brad Keller (2-0) allowed two singles in six shutout innings. He was acquired from Cincinnati in the 2017 Rule 5 Draft. The bullpen barely held on. Jesse Winker, Freddy Galvis and Josh VanMeter homered in the seventh, cutting it to 5-4. Josh Staumont escaped a two-on threat in the eighth with a pair of called third strikes. Trevor Rosenthal walked the bases loaded with one out in the ninth but got Christian Colón to ground into a double play, earning his fourth save in as many chances. The Reds wasted a chance to get back to .500 and lost their only left-handed starter after less than two innings. They signed Miley (0-2) to a two-year, $15 million deal in the offseason. He retired only five batters during his Reds debut, giving up six runs in a loss to the Cubs on July 27. He went on the injured list with a sore groin afterward. Miley returned and appeared to hurt himself when he stepped awkwardly while covering first base in the second inning. After talking to a trainer, Miley stayed in the game, walked the next batter and left after only 1 2/3 innings again. There was no information about his condition. Perez connected for his fourth homer off Tyler Mahle, extending his hitting streak to 10 games — his longest since 2017. He's batting .429 (18 for 42) during the streak. The Royals are 17-10 all-time vs. the Reds, including 12-4 since the start of 2009. They're...

Dear Editor,
   
 Public/preventative health is not a " glamorous " part of the scope of medicine, compared to heart transplants, emergency room drama, cancer cures, etc. But, public/preventative health measures save more lives than any other of the various medical fields. When I arrived here to start practice in 1972, there was no Public Health Department. Now, we have a state of the art, well planned building with a dedicated staff serving our community ( I recently had a Covid 19 test, and had results in  but from the state's control of some functions of our health department. We have excellent funds, but we are not always allowed to use them to the fullest extent because of state guidelines. This is changing some, and Mr. Jones is representing our needs very well. I want Pawhuskans to be proud of their Health Department -- it took a long time, and a lot of work, to have what we have.
   
 Another thought: Shouldn't we wear masks in public, to protect others from catching an unexpected Corona Virus infection from us? We wear clothes in public, as a (?) moral mandate. Shouldn't we wear masks at this time, as a health mandate?
   
 Sincerely,

On Saturday mornings at the State Movie Theater in Pawhuska, Oklahoma in the 1950s you could see a black-and-white double feature western where the good guys wore white hats and the bad guys wore black masks. The lines were not blurred. Cowboys, good; rustlers, bad. Lawmen, good; bandana-wearing holdup men, bad. No mask, good; mask, bad.
   
 Today society has divided into two warring factions that are as defined as those satisfying old movie plots but which are themselves not very satisfying. One group champions masks as proof of one's concern for others, and the other group eschews masks as unnecessary and an infringement on individual liberty. However, most of the members of both groups still view cowboys as the good guys.
   
 In my family we had my mother's youngest brother, Uncle Bud, a rodeo cowboy who roped calves and steers. He was one of my heroes even though the mean billy goat he used to practice his roping often butted me across the roping arena.
   
 Another of our family's cowgirl heroines was and is my oldest brother's wife, Shirley Smith Redwine. Sister Shirley competed in barrel racing, pole bending and flag racing for several years at the International Roundup Cavalcade in Osage County, Oklahoma. Shirley was a member of both the Turley, Oklahoma and Sand Springs, Oklahoma round up clubs and she competed as a queen candidate several times. Shirley's mother, Esther, designed and sewed Shirley's fancy outfits and Shirley's father, Hollis, trained her horses. She competed from age 12 until her freshman year at Oklahoma State University, where she met my brother, C.E. Redwine, who managed to win Shirley's heart with his saxophone and ended her rodeo career.
   
 But Shirley has always remained a cowgirl at heart. She knows right from wrong and has always fearlessly championed the right. Cowboys are supposed to stand up and be counted. Shirley did just that when COVID-19 struck our world. She put her sewing skills to work and made masks for our whole family. Now I do not know how many other cowboys and cowgirls have mounted up to confront Ole 19, but I believe true cowboys and cowgirls are not afraid to stand up against any evil. So, cowgirl Shirley, thanks for the masks. Peg and I follow your lead and wear them whenever we go out and about. We do notice there are some folks who do not wear masks. Maybe the rest of the good guys can help get the message out until 'Ole 19 goes the way of the Saturday morning horse operas.

NACIONES UNIDAS (AP) — El secretario general de la ONU Antonio Guterres advirtió el miércoles que la pandemia de COVID-19 no sólo amenaza los avances contra la pobreza global y en la construcción de la paz, sino que podría exacerbar conflictos y generar nuevos. Durante una reunión del Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU sobre el desafío de mantener la paz durante la pandemia, Guterres dijo que su llamado emitido el 23 de marzo para un cese del fuego inmediato en los conflictos de todo el mundo para enfrentar el coronavirus llevó a varias partes en conflicto a tomar medidas para reducir las tensiones y dejar de pelear. “Sin embargo, lamentablemente, en muchas instancias la pandemia no hizo que las partes suspendieran las hostilidades o acordaran un cese al fuego permanente”, comentó Guterres. Su predecesor en el puesto de secretario general, Ban Ki-moon, comentó ante el consejo que “es realmente sorprendente que en respuesta a esta pandemia, el mundo ha colocado a miles de millones de personas bajo medidas de confinamiento, cerrado las fronteras internacionales, suspendido el comercio y la migración, y ha cerrado temporalmente una amplia variedad de industrias, pero no ha logrado suspender los conflictos armados”. Mientras los gobiernos tratan de hacer frente a la pandemia, algunos grupos han visto una oportunidad para aumentar la violencia, señaló Ban, citando como ejemplos a Boko Haram y otros milicianos en Nigeria, la creciente violencia colectiva en Congo y los asesinatos por parte de los cárteles del narcotráfico en México. Ban criticó al Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU por desperdiciar meses en “discusiones sobre los detalles del texto” y no adoptar una resolución hasta el 1 de julio para exigir un “cese inmediato de las hostilidades” en conflictos clave, como en Siria, Yemen,...

I recently stepped away from a career in community newspapers where I spent the better part of my days consuming vast quantities of news stories and commentary, both in print and online.
   
 After a full day of being bombarded by headlines and suffering from information overload, the last thing I wanted to do was watch another news broadcast on television.
   
 But after being away from the news industry for a time, I began tuning in to daytime cable news shows. Whether CNN, Fox, or MSNBC, I witnessed all of these cable network "news" broadcasts routinely do something that violates the very principles of fair and impartial reporting. Almost without fail, the anchors/hosts of these news shows on each network routinely mingled their own personal opinion with the day's headlines.
   
 This does not even include the "talking head" analysis shows in which a panel of political insiders hold forth their learned opinions on the the news of the day. But now, even moderators insert their personal judgment and opinions.
   
 There was a time when this was strictly forbidden. Legendary CBS anchorman, the late Walter Cronkite, was known as "the most trusted man in America" for a reason. He reported the news impartially and revealed no personal bias while doing so. Whether it was the Kennedy assassinations, the rise of the NASA space program, the heat of the Civil Rights movement, or the Watergate scandal, he reported accurately and faithfully each evening to the American viewing public.
   
 In the rare occasions when Cronkite did engage in commentary -- as he famously did during the Vietnam War -- the editorial content was clearly segregated from the rest of the newscast (usually at the end) and it was typically labeled "Commentary."
   
 Early network TV shows featuring news analysis and commentary were strictly segregated from nightly newscasts. It applied to all three networks (ABC, NBC, CBS) and a virtual pantheon of broadcast news giants like Chet Huntley, David Brinkley, Frank Reynolds, and Edward R. Murrow, followed this template.
   
 Sadly, this is no longer a common practice. Networks on both the right and left of the political spectrum (a problem in itself) routinely cloud news reporting with personal "takes," comments, and outright editorializing. This practice has helped undermine, if not completely destroy, the credibility of the national TV news media.
   
 Everyone has become an instant expert or political operative more interested in scoring points for "their side." This troublesome practice has only become more acute and widespread during the Trump presidency and the resulting political polarization.
   
 Who can we trust? Is there still a TV network out there somewhere that plays it straight?
   
 There are scant options. Ironically, during this time of near-constant information flow, accurate and unbiased information is even more difficult to identify. Facebook and Twitter are certainly not the answer.
   
 This is why your local news outlets are still a vital, if not indispensable, source of reliable news and information. Unlike the national media, community newspapers, local radio stations and TV stations are typically focused on the community. The hard-working journalists who staff local media outlets live and work among the very people and organizations they frequently report on. And unlike much of the national electronic media, this holds local journalists accountable and responsive to their audience.
   
 In some ways, the national "media" (the one most Americans complain about most often) and the local news outlets are almost different industries. Never has that become more clear than it is today.
   
 For information that actually impacts your daily life, subscribe to a local newspaper, or listen to a newscast on a local radio station. They still label news as news and opinion as opinion. You'll also be more informed than almost anyone else relying solely on national or social media.
   
 In the immortal words of Cronkite, "And that's the way it is …"
