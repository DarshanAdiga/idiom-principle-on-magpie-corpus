The outbreak at City Hall was reported by news media on Tuesday, October 27. City Manager Chris Lagerbloom confirmed that he had tested positive for the virus one week earlier, on Tuesday, October 20. The day before -- Monday, October 19 -- Lagerbloom had attended meetings alongside Trantalis and his chief of staff, according to the _Sun Sentinel_. The mayor told the newspaper they had followed proper protocols, including wearing masks and maintaining a six-foot social distance.
 Four days after the city manager tested positive for the virus, the mayor participated in a beach cleanup with students from Dillard High School. And this Wednesday afternoon -- nine days after the meeting with Lagerbloom -- Trantalis was pictured with his mask pulled down while standing next to Fort Lauderdale Commissioner Steven Glassman at the groundbreaking for a new housing project.
 Although Trantalis says he tested negative, CDC guidelines, which the city often promotes, say that people who were exposed to someone with the virus should quarantine for two weeks even if they test negative to account for the two-week incubation period for the illness to possibly develop.
 "The CDC basically said in the early days of infection, when you were still infectious, you might not test positive," Cochrane tells _New Times_. "I think that the city knows this. That's why there were 12 people who did test positive, and there are 30 people that didn't test positive who are quarantined. I mean, they know these guidelines and enforce these guidelines."

  # State will let Kiryas Joel schools reopen if all students and staff are tested for virus


  Chris McKenna Jon Campbell


  Times Herald-Record


  Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced modified rules for coronavirus hot spots on Friday that will allow schools serving nearly 15,000 children in the Kiryas Joel area to reopen after all students and staff members have been tested for the virus.


  The new rules applied to schools in areas designated as either red or orange zones because of spikes in COVID-19 cases. Kiryas Joel, identified as a red zone on Oct. 6, was downgraded to an orange zone this week after COVID-19 cases subsided, which increased the number of people allowed inside synagogues but still required that schools be closed.


  Most children in the Hasidic community attend religious schools, some of which defied state and county orders to close or declared themselves day care centers in order to stay open. But the orders did force Kiryas Joel's only public school to shut for three weeks, cutting off in-person classes and therapy for its special-needs students, some with severe disabilities.


  Isaac Weinberger, whose 10-year-old son has Down Syndrome and attends Kiryas Joel's public school, said Friday that his son has been regressing without the seven hours of daily instruction and therapy that are helping him speak, grasp utensils and do a host of other tasks that don't come easily to him.


  The school's staff has managed to provide remote instruction for some students during the closure, but Naftuli needs in-person therapy and has had no schooling at all for three weeks. His father argued the state should adjust its restrictions to accommodate special education or require frequent virus testing if that would enable Naftuli's school to reopen.


  "All of us would be happy to get tested every day," Weinberger said.


  Cuomo announced that very policy move to reporters an hour later in a conference call.


  He said that after discussions with school officials in red and orange zones, his administration is allowing school to reopen but will require every student and employee to test negative for COVID-19 before they return. Once schools reopen, they must test 25 percent of their students and staff each week to monitor for new infections.


  "We've been working with them to find ways to keep people safe but allow children to go to school," Cuomo said. "We have an agreement with them on a protocol that I think keeps people safe and allows children to be educated."


  As of Friday, the state had carved out red or orange zones in parts of Orange, Rockland, Steuben and Chemung counties and Brooklyn. It also had designated yellow zones with lighter restrictions in those counties too, plus Broome and Steuben counties and Queens.


  The yellow zone drawn around Kiryas Joel has led the Monroe-Woodbury School District to close its North Main Elementary School, which would otherwise have had to test 20 percent of its students and staff every week.


  Cuomo said he believes the new testing plan in red and orange zones strikes the right balance between safety and ensuring children can attend school, which has major child-care implications.


  The added benefit is getting a greater sense of COVID-19's spread through a community by being able to track cases back to a particular student's household and who they had contact with.


  "It will also give us an idea about homes and households in that area," Cuomo said. "If a child tests positive, then we can contact trace back to the family."
