Gavin Newsom's plan to cover a $54.3 billion budget deficit includes slashing spending that keeps more than 45,000 people out of nursing homes, one of a series of cuts targeting older adults who are among the most at risk for the new coronavirus. The cuts have angered state lawmakers from both political parties who say it's irresponsible in light of the coronavirus pandemic that has spread through nursing homes across the state. less

The proposed cuts have angered state lawmakers from both major political parties who say it's irresponsible in light of the coronavirus pandemic that has spread through nursing homes across the state. It's one of many conflicts emerging this week as lawmakers hold public hearings examining Newsom's proposal before they must vote on a spending plan by June 15.

She said that she was unable to get to them prior to them leaving the store.

Republican candidates in Texas and across the nation have a better shot at winning when voter turnout is low. Even President Donald Trump admits that truth.
   
 "They had things - levels of voting, that, if you ever agreed to it, you'd never have a Republican elected in this country again," Trump said in an interview about broadening access to vote-by-mail ballots in light of a raging pandemic.
   
 Trump is clearly frightened at the prospect of high voter turnout in the 2020 elections. The fright is not new among Republicans. They've been working to suppress the votes of qualified citizens for decades.
   
 The legal battles are already intense in Texas. Democrats obtained a state district court order allowing all voters to apply for mail ballots in the upcoming July runoff elections and the general election of 2020.
   
 Current state law allowed mail ballots by those 65 and older and those suffering from a disability who believe their health threatened by voting in person.
   
 The state judge ruled that fear of contracting COVID-19 met the legal standard. Republican Gov. Greg Abbott and Attorney General Ken Paxton are in court arguing that fear of contracting a disease that could kill you or your loved ones is no excuse.
   
 "Fear of contracting COVID-19 does not amount to a sickness of physical condition as required by law," Paxton argued in a recent court filing.
   
 Paxton is telling Texans that if they want to participate in democracy, they must risk death. Please pause a moment and let that settle in your mind. Think of the democratic ideals and practices you were taught in high school civics classes, the struggle for voting rights that lasted more than 200 years before legal universal suffrage was achieved.
   
 Sadly, Republicans view these practices, ideals and achievements as little but obstacles to their power.
   
 For decades, courageous African Americans risked their lives by voting. Many died at the hands of racists. For instance, back on November 2, 1920, a young black man named July Perry cast his ballot in Ocoee, Florida. Before the day ended, Klansmen had murdered Perry and others and burned Ocoee to the ground.
   
 Today, it would be understandable if all Americans were to taste the fear that July Perry must have tasted that day. Maybe it won't be Klansmen we fear, but to vote in public likely means we face COVID-19, a killer far more deadly than the Ku Klux Klan ever was.
   
 Last year, Abbott and his secretary of state got caught launching a scheme aimed at knocking thousands of qualified citizens off the voter rolls. Letters were to be sent to voters, and if they didn't reply, they were stricken from the rolls. You can guess who the targets were of that scheme - voters the GOP felt might oppose them.
   
 Until 2018 when a federal court order was lifted after 35 years, the Republican National Committee had been prohibited from engaging in precisely that activity.
   
 Today, Republican-led state governments are trying to do what the federal courts have said violates the Constitution. So are state GOP parties and operatives.
   
 The battle over mail ballots should be viewed in that context.

Astrid Orr of ESA’s human spaceflight research programme oversees physical science experiments in weightlessness for human and robotic exploration.
 She says: “This project is a wonderful example of scientific research that can be performed in weightlessness without leaving Earth.
 “Dropping graphene and shooting it with lasers is fascinating. To think that this research could help scientists to send instruments through the solar system and, if one dares to dream, to distant star systems in years to come is the icing on the cake.”

 Major League Soccer has cancelled its 2020 all-star game as well as the Leagues Cup and Campeones Cup.
 The all-star game, pitting MLS all-stars against their Mexican league counterparts, was scheduled for July 29 at the Banc of California Stadium in Los Angeles.
 The second edition of the Leagues Cup, a tournament featuring MLS and Liga MX teams, was slated to run between July and September. The third edition of the Campeones Cup was scheduled for Aug. 12 in Seattle between the MLS champion Sounders and Mexican league winner.
 The games were cancelled "to provide the most available dates for the remainder of the year for league competition."
 The league said all three marquee events will return in 2021.
 MLS suspended play on March 12, two weeks into the 2020 season, due to the global pandemic. Teams have begun individual voluntary outdoor workouts at their training facilities amidst reports the league is looking to play games out of a central hub, possibly in the Orlando area, later in the summer.
 The league said the 2021 MLS all-star game will take place in Los Angeles at the same venue with "every expectation" that MLS and Liga MX all-stars will face off.
 MLS also said it was reviewing proposals from three cities to host the 2022 all-star game.

However, if you already have a tool you love, you might be like, “Meh.” If you are the type who loves researching all of the tools to find your perfect match, then this is likely exciting news for you. Options are always good, though. The strangest thing is that Google has had this capability all along. When schools started shuttering during the pandemic, Zoom immediately stepped up and offered educators its professional tools for free-a clutch move that garnered them loads of positive press and help propel them past competitors into the top spot.

That's not all. " Viruses have been around a long time and multiply rapidly in large numbers. This gives them lots of practice at evading host defense mechanisms," Deye says. Viruses are essentially "dead" until they invade a host, where they use that host's own cellular mechanisms to replicate. "So they have fewer of their own processes that we can target with drugs," Deye says. But there are targets -- those few proteins in the virus itself or those in the host cell -- that allow the virus to take hold. "And our experience with infections like HIV, hepatitis C and influenza has given us practice at developing drugs to target these," he says.

The Bay of Bengal's fiercest cyclone this century was bearing down on millions of people in eastern India and Bangladesh on Wednesday, with forecasts of a potentially devastating and deadly storm surge.
 Authorities have scrambled to stage mass evacuations away from the path of Amphan, which is only the second "super cyclone" to form in the northeastern Indian Ocean since records began.
 But their efforts have been hampered by the need to follow strict precautions to prevent the spread of the coronavirus pandemic, with infection numbers still soaring in both countries.
 Out at sea the vast weather system visible from space packed winds of up to 240 kilometres per hour (150 mph), the equivalent of a category four hurricane.
 It was expected to ease slightly before crossing the coasts of the eastern Indian state of West Bengal and neighbouring Bangladesh after 0900 GMT.
