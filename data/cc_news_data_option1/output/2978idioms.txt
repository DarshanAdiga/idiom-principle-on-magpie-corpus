After backlash, he later said that he wasn’t interested in the NHS, even if it was on a _‘silver platter. ' _ Yet, the U.S. still hold all the power in terms of post-Brexit trade deals, and clearly still want a slice of British companies.

Gloucester’s attacking game is great and they’ve been an attacking rugby team for a long time and done some really good things in the past. There’s a big demand in Gloucester that the rugby team is a success and, from my perspective coming in, I’ve been talking to the players about their strengths and what they think they can be stronger at, and we’re taking a fluid approach to that. If we can get the weaker bits a bit stronger, hopefully it will lead to a team that knows where it wants to go and we can build off the back of that. What’s gone on before has happened and the club obviously felt it was time for change and a different emphasis – maybe a change of character, however you want to call it. There’s a lot of good stuff at the club but also lots of other bits that I’m talking to the players and coaches about how to make the shifts we need to become that winning team.

Covid’s provided an interesting dynamic because until last week we hadn’t been able to do any team meetings, train together or even shake hands and get to know each other properly. We’re going to roll into nine games with only three weeks of proper training behind us, with short breaks between some of the games as well, which is going to be demanding on the squad and a new coaching team who are still feeling their way into it. Equally, though, it’s a great opportunity for the players to say, ‘This is who I am, this is what I’m about, now pick me’ and I think it will be fast and furious with a lot of pressure.

There’s a good understanding of the changes made and where the club wants to go, but we’ve not set any specific short-term targets. There have been so many changes on and off the field that while everyone wants to be successful and that’s the target for every team, it’s more important for us to put the foundations in place for the future now and try to get things organised and work out exactly what this team stands for. Once that’s in place and everyone’s clear, then you can start to build on it.

 Firstly, break things down into manageable chunks, that people can still work towards at the end of the day, the end of the week, ticking them off in their calendar. Try to avoid thinking of the big picture.
 “We don’t know how long we’re going to be isolated for, but even without knowing, people can still work towards the end of the day, the end of the week, ticking them off in their calendar.”
 Next, avoid the temptation to vegetate in your pyjamas, watching Netflix and waiting for the world to end. This approach serves nobody.

 Her legal team has claimed in court documents that she did not know the People magazine article was due to appear, would not have agreed to the letter's contents being revealed, and after its publication she phoned friend A to express "her distress".
 Mr Rushbrooke said "there is ample evidence before the court" to support the duchess's application to maintain the anonymity of her five friends.
 He added that one of the five, known only as friend B, had provided a witness statement to the court in support of the application.

En debut d'annee, des rumeurs avaient egalement circule selon lesquelles Bea Diallo pourrait entrer dans la course a la presidence de la republique de Guinee. Il avait clarifie a la mi-janvier ne pas etre officiellement candidat mais etre "disponible et pret" si jamais il etait "appele par la population a incarner une solution". Fin mars, le parti du president guineen Alpha Conde, le Rassemblement du peuple de Guinee (RPG), est sorti grand vainqueur d'elections legislatives boycottees par les principaux partis d'opposition. Le meme jour (22 mars), un referendum entache de violences interrogeait la population sur un changement de Constitution. Selon l'opposition, le passage a ce nouveau texte pourrait servir de pretexte au president Conde pour briguer un troisieme mandat aux elections d'octobre prochain, alors que les mandats presidentiels sont normalement limites a deux. Alpha Conde lui-meme est de moins en moins mysterieux sur sa volonte de se representer. "Dans l'etat actuel des choses, je crains le pire a l'issue du scrutin presidentiel du 18 octobre prochain. Tous les leaders guineens sont moralement responsables devant le peuple. Les interets particuliers ne peuvent continuer a primer sur la vie de nos concitoyens. Tout le monde doit regagner la raison et se mettre autour de la table pour resoudre pacifiquement ce conflit", s'inquiete Bea Diallo. Depuis mi-octobre, la mobilisation contre M. Conde donne lieu a des manifestations massives, a des journees villes mortes qui impactent l'economie d'un des pays les plus pauvres de la planete, et a de graves brutalites policieres, ayant fait des dizaines de morts.
