A PIL has been filed in the Supreme Court seeking uniform education, having common syllabus and curriculum for all the children aged between 6-14 years, across the country.The plea filed by BJP leader and advocate Ashwini Kumar Upadhyay has sough directions to look into the feasibility of establishing "One Nation One Education Board" by merging the Indian Certificate of Secondary Education Board and the Central Board of Secondary Education.The plea, filed through advocate Ashwani Kumar Dubey, said the Centre and states have not taken appropriate steps to introduce uniform education system having common syllabus and common curriculum in spirit of Article 21A (free and compulsory education).Children may not be able to exercise their fundamental right under Article 21A unless the Centre and the states provide value based uniform education, the plea said."To achieve substantive socio-economic equality and justice, it is necessary that syllabus and curriculum in all primary schools are similar whether it is run by management, local body, Union or State Government," the plea said.The PIL said although the medium of instructions may differ according to the official language of the concerned state, the syllabus and curriculum must be common for all children aged 6-14 years.The petition has sought directions to ascertain the feasibility of constituting a National Education Council (on the lines of GST Council) or National Education Commission to implement the system.At present each education board has its own syllabus and curriculum and entrance examinations are based on CBSE, so prevailing system doesn't provide equal opportunity to all students, it said.The plea has also sought directions to ascertain the feasibility of introducing a standard textbook having chapters on fundamental rights, duties, directive principles and the golden goals set out in the Preamble, and make its study compulsory for all the children aged 6-14 years throughout the country.It contended that from last ten years data, it can be seen that even though children are pursuing free and compulsory education under RTE Act, the students do not perform well as compared to CBSE affiliated convent and private schools.  Therefore, value- based uniform education having common syllabus and common curriculum is need of the day, it said."State board students are not equipped to compete with students of CBSE affiliated schools. Even this disparity cannot be fully removed but Union can establish a standardized entrance system for college and university aspirants," the plea said.

Ford will try to reduce range anxiety for buyers of its electric Mustang Mach-E by predicting the range more precisely. It unveiled a feature called Intelligent Range that will calculate how far you can go based on factors like driving behavior, weather forecasts and crowdsourced data from other Mach-E vehicles. "Changes in driver behavior and the environment can impact range, which is the reason other electric vehicles often experience significant range adjustments," said Ford EV charging manager Mark Poll in a statement.Left unsaid is that drivers purchase Mustangs with the aim of exercising their right foot muscles. Doing so in an EV can drastically cut range, especially in one like the Mach-E that can do 0 to 60 mph in the mid- three-second range. The idea is that once Intelligent Range figures out how fast you like to go, it should be able to help you avoid dead battery syndrome. Ford said that it will use the cloud to combine driver behavior, forecast weather (since temperatures affect battery life) and road\/terrain conditions. It will then use fleet averages to improve range estimates, even on roads you've never driven. If range will be impacted on a given route, the Mach-E will tell you why and give a new estimate before you depart. Down the road, Ford will deliver over-the-air updates that factor in "real-time traffic, road-slope, the terrain and elevation of a given route, and even the temperature at [the] final destination," the automaker said. The 2021 Mustang Mach-E is expected to have a 300 mile extended range (235 miles for the GT model) and will arrive in the US by late 2020. It'll start at $43,895 excluding the $7,500 federal tax credit.

People who pride themselves on working from data can find themselves at sea when there is not time to process it. Barack Obama was asked a question during the 2008 campaign about how he would handle a passenger jet barreling toward the Capitol, and his first response was, “What you want is somebody who is, first of all, going to get all the facts and gather up good intelligence. The second thing you want is somebody who is able to analyze the situation, the costs and benefits of action.” That reflex led him to wait eight months after the CIA reported a “strong possibility of the location of Osama bin Laden” before he authorized a raid. Had bin Laden moved in the interim, Obama’s instinct to wait for better information would have lost the opportunity.

Актер снимется в триллере об известном убийце Теде Банди. Элайджа Вуд решил еще дальше отойти от роли добродушного хоббита из «Властелина Колец» и сняться в новом триллере под названием No man of God. Актер исполнит роль агента ФБР, который должен будет понять мотивацию серийного убийцы, чтобы все-таки выйти на след опасного преступника. Как сообщает издание Deadline, фильм будет основан на реальных событиях, в которых агент Билл Хагмайер долгое время общался с с убийцей и насильником Тедом Банди, который был казнен в 1989 году. Все это чем-то напоминает сериал Дэвида Финчера \"Охотник за разумом\", не правда ли?Сюжет будет описывать отношения, которые в итоге сложились между кровожадным маньяком в его последние годы жизни и агентом ФБР, который страстно желает узнать, что же побудило Банди пойти на столь жестокие поступки. В целом это будет напоминать общение Ганнибала Лектера с Кларис Старлинг в «Молчании ягнят».Режиссером выступит Амбер Сили, а сценарием займется Кристофер Роберт Каргилл, работавший над ужастиком «Синистер».

Consider _which_ claims are examined as questions of data, and which are not. For example, most progressives would be horrified at using cost-benefit analysis to enact policies against statistically riskier sexual behaviors, because they regard sexual liberty as a good too important to be put under a green eyeshade. Yet, when the subject turns to drinking large sodas, or smoking cigarettes, or firing a gun, or riding a motorcycle without a helmet, suddenly the value of freedom is not even in the equation. In the Black Lives Matter debate, it is considered heretical to actually examine the number of unarmed black Americans killed by the police in comparative statistical terms. You may agree or disagree with the relative hierarchy of values that this implies, but make no mistake: These are _value judgments_ , not merely scientific statements. Someone, at some point, has to decide what things matter before trying to count them, and what things matter too much to be counted.

Look at social-science literature on divorce. There is a cottage industry of studies of children of divorce, many of which seem tailored to reassure divorced parents that their kids will, statistically speaking, turn out just fine in the long run. Studies, however, cannot truly quantify the pain and anguish that children of divorce routinely experience. If you have been through a divorce or know anyone who has, or if you’ve spent any time listening to a child of divorce, you know this. What is the quantifiable value of a happy childhood? If you can’t put a number on happiness, does it still exist?

A core premise of democracy, as with the jury system, is that decisions of great importance to life, liberty, and property should be made with the input of ordinary citizens. One reason is to legitimate decisions by making people feel involved — a goal that is subverted by privileging social-science data over popular sentiment. More importantly, decisions made with the input of the broad diversity of ordinary citizens are, in the long run, likely to be _better_ decisions. Ordinary citizens as a group have broader and more varied experience than particular individuals. Moreover, every individual is likely to know more about his or her own circumstances than even the most rigorous expert. These advantages are especially pronounced when dealing with matters of family, child-rearing, education, and lifestyle that are well within the life experience of most adults. The common man is valuable not because there is great virtue in being “common,” but precisely because the common man, being more numerous than the uncommon man, has more human experiences — and more opportunities to learn from his mistakes. This brings to bear the greatest possible amount of accumulated wisdom and dilutes the folly of any particular individual. As George Orwell wrote of Nazi Germany, “So long as the common man can get a hearing, such elementary rules as not fighting all your enemies simultaneously are less likely to be violated.”
