Today more than a dozen states are easing their lockdown restrictions, increasing the number emerging from the COVID-19 economic shutdown. It almost seems as if the decision whether or not to go outside has become political, but increasingly it seems states are moving to the model Sweden has used all along. Their herd immunity approach has been mocked and criticized. However, as John Fund and Joel Hay point out in _National Review_ , it has actually worked fairly well. The highlights:

The State Department began warning against cruise travel on March 8, and the CDC issued a no-sail order on March 14, which was extended and set to expire on July 24. The order prompted several countries, including some in the Caribbean, to reject cruise ships suspected of carrying infected passengers and crew members, stranding some ships at sea for weeks.

And here he was, assistant general secretary in a major company, and a Christian to boot, talking to a dead woman he’d dreamed of. Still, as he closed the door, he sensed his dream woman’s agitation, sensed her saying that all was not right, and now he was thinking that maybe if he opened his mind, just opened his mind, for once, but he wasn’t brought up that way, those things were of the Devil; the dead didn’t communicate with the living. Open your mind to those things and maybe anything could slip through… What was that book Michael had…You Forever? He’d flipped a few pages and there was something on astral travelling…of one’s spirit roaming while one slept; it had bothered him that Michael was reading that sort of stuff.

He had awoken this morning with the drained feeling that had bothered him last week; dragged up from deep sleep by his mother’s insistent rapping at his door. He had gone through the rest of the day in a fog of exhaustion. He had left work around three, caught a car home, bolted down his dinner, tumbled into bed… And had apparently slept for six whole hours.

First off, when do tipsters' personal information become public data? The county attorney insisted that the police could not redact that information, but that is almost assuredly wrong. Anonymous tips and complaint processes have long been established for both civil and criminal enforcement, especially for workplace safety violations. That provides employees a safe method of allowing enforcement of such regulations without fear of retaliation. Beyond that, do police routinely release personal info for people who call in tips on drug deals? Gang violence? Organized-crime activity? This release will dry up a  _lot_ of information for St. Louis County, Missouri, not just about COVID-19. As satisfying as it might be to those who oppose shelter-in-place requirements, this is a really  _dumb  _decision.

There are so many ways to celebrate moms on Mother's Day which, if you haven't been keeping track of your calendar, is on May 10. You can send a card, you can make a phone call - don't you DARE text her - you can, if everyone is masked up to the max and keeping their distances, pay a visit. Or you can observe the day with moms other than your own. Some of the best - and worst - of them have been in movies.      So, in honor of moms everywhere, and of every sort, here's a top 10 list of movies that have featured mothers in pivotal parts.      "Carrie" (1976) - Piper Laurie made it to the Oscars with a Supporting Actress nomination as Margaret White, the intimidating religious fanatic mom of Sissy Spacek's title character who was regularly the victim of her crazy mother's penchant for punishment, and her irrational fear of not inflicting it.      "Flirting with Disaster" (1996) - There are many mothers in this comedy about Mel Coplin's (Ben Stiller) search for his birth mom. Accolades go to two of them: his take-no-prisoners adoptive mother, Pearl (Mary Tyler Moore), who won't let anyone get in the way of her own words, and his laidback hippie of a real mom, Mary Schlichting (Lily Tomlin), who knows the right way to talk people down from bad acid trips.      "Forrest Gump" (1994) - Mrs. Gump (Sally Field) is Forrest's (Tom Hanks) loving mom, a sweet woman who has oddball thoughts spinning in her head (about vacations, about the Ku Klux Klan), and is credited with the idea of life being like a box of chocolates. She also makes sacrifices for her son, like sleeping with his public school principal so Forrest won't have to go to a "special" school.      "Hairspray" (2007) - John Travolta was nominated for his acting in "Saturday Night Fever" and "Pulp Fiction," and probably should have been for his willingness to go so over the top - in both sight and sound - as Edna Turnblad, the lovable and ever-loving - and ironing and dancing - mom of Tracy (Nikki Blonsky).      "The Incredibles" (2004) - When Elastigirl (voice of Holly Hunter) is fighting the bad guys, alongside her husband, Mr. Incredible (Craig T. Nelson), she's as fierce as they come. When she's back home, playing mom to her three kids, and answering to the name Helen Parr, she's loving and protective ... and still pretty darn fierce about trying to keep a semblance of normalcy.      "Lady Bird" (2017) - Laurie Metcalf's Marion McPherson is all over the place in moods and attitudes, and she's quick to dole out advice to her daughter, Lady Bird (Saoirse Ronan), such as explaining that being successful doesn't mean that you're happy. The two characters do a bit of verbal sparring, but there's nobody that Marion cares more about than Lady Bird.      "The Manchurian Candidate" (1962) - Patty Duke won the Supporting Actress Oscar for "The Miracle Worker," but it should have gone to Angela Lansbury, for her performance as Eleanor Shaw Iselin, the conniving and downright evil mother of Raymond Shaw (Laurence Harvey), who values political power over the life of her son.      "Mommie Dearest" (1981) - There's evil and then there's its anagram, vile. Faye Dunaway got to sharpen the acting tools that would bring out the despicable side of Joan Crawford who was, to put it mildly, totally in charge of the abusive, passive-aggressive relationship with her adopted daughter Christina (Diana Scarwid). Definitely a disturbed, out-of-control mom.      "Mother" (1996) - Debbie Reynolds made it appear that her character, Beatrice Henderson, the doting mother of John (Albert Brooks) was a bit clueless. Oh, please! Sure, she wasn't technically savvy, and she didn't really know her way around fresh food, but she's a great mom who only wants the best for both of her sons. She's sweet and funny.      "Room" (2015) - Brie Larson is known only as Ma in this emotional storm of a movie in which she's kidnapped, made pregnant, and made captive in a 10x10 windowless room, in which, over the years, she raises her son (Jacob Tremblay). Larson manages to imbue the challenging performance and desperate situation with a great deal of light. And love saves the day.      All films are available through Amazon Prime Video.

Tens of thousands of people liked that tweet and I saw many, many more that framed the AP story as proof Reade had changed her story and was not credible. There's just one problem with that narrative. Tara Reade has said all along that her complaint didn't mention sexual assault. In fact, two reporters who have previously interviewed Tara Reade at length seemed surprised the AP was treating this as a scoop. Here's Ryan Grim from the intercept responding to Scarborough's tweet:

Some of the stragglers glanced up as he entered the hallway. He sensed a wariness in their stares, and that, too, was different. Desmond the barman was passing a bowl of ice to the prostitute called Marilyn. He glanced up at Michael. For a moment, he just stood there, holding the bowl and staring at Michael, with a pasted-on smile on his face. Then he passed the bowl to the prostitute, who was babbling away at the barman. She collected the bowl, turned, and saw Michael. She averted her eyes, then hurried over to a table near the punch-box.
