In addition, beginning April 29, 2020, the Sheriff’s Office added UV sanitation of all areas using the Skytron 1140 Sentry Disinfection Robot which uses a highly germicidal ultraviolet bandwidth which causes photochemical damage to cellular DNA and virus RNA. This technology is most commonly used in hospitals to quickly sanitize surgical rooms, municipal water supplies and is now being utilized in the Racine County Jail. Studies have shown that UV disinfection is 99.999% effective in the reduction of coronavirus. Additionally, this device can also be used in other county facilities, including the Racine County Board Room and Racine County Circuit Courts, so that our county government and judicial system can continue to safely serve our community, thereby creating peace of mind for all. A grant covered the purchase of the technology.

The Pittsburgh region, including Washington and Greene counties, will remain in the red zone with nonessential businesses closed under Gov. Tom Wolf's economic reopening plan during the COVID-19 pandemic.
 Wolf announced Friday that 24 counties in the north-central and northeastern regions of the state will on May 8 move into the yellow zone under his color- coded plan to slowly reopen the economy in select areas.
 “We have seen our new case numbers stabilize statewide, and while we still have areas where outbreaks are occurring, we also have many areas that have few or no new cases,” Wolf stated in a news release.
 The 24 counties that will move from red to yellow are: Bradford, Cameron, Centre, Clarion, Clearfield, Clinton, Crawford, Elk, Erie, Forest, Jefferson, Lawrence, Lycoming, McKean, Mercer, Montour, Northumberland, Potter, Snyder, Sullivan, Tioga, Union, Venango and Warren.

 All extended expiration dates of Class D Driver Licenses, State Issued Identification Cards, Handicap Parking Placards, Commercial Driver Licenses (CDLs) and Commercial Learner Permits (CLPs) will be considered expired after June 30, 2020.
 Previous extensions do not apply to invalid driver licenses due to suspension, revocation or denial.
 The COVID-19 pandemic has also pushed back the DPS timeline for issuing REAL ID to Oklahomans. In late March, the Department of Homeland Security delayed the REAL ID enforcement deadline another 12 months to Oct. 1, 2021 because of the pandemic. DPS was originally set to begin issuing REAL IDs in April but because of the challenges posed by the virus, that date has been delayed. DPS has not been able to get the new work stations across the state and has not not been able to train DPS employees and tag agents because of social distancing guidelines. Employees have still been working diligently on getting REAL ID processes up and running and DPS hopes to be offering this service soon.

Following graduation, Heiser plans to continue playing basketball. Earlier this year, she signed her national letter of intent to continue her career at Sheridan College.
 As for Payton Tucker, another top athlete from Green River, he too leaves behind a lasting legacy.
 As one of the top wrestlers in the state, Tucker wrapped up his high school wrestling career as a three-time state champion and a three-time all-state selection for the Wolves.
 This past winter, wrestling at 182 pounds, Tucker closed out his final year in green and white with an impressive record of 38-2.
 When asked why Tucker deserved the nomination for Southwest District Senior Student Athlete of the Year, wrestling coach Josh Wisniewsk responded, "When our athletic director (Tony Beardsley) asked me who I wanted to nominate, my first thought was Payton."
 "Not only did Payton have another fantastic season, but he finished the year with his third-straight title, his third regional title, and his third Ron Thon Title."
 Wisniewski added, "Next to winning almost every tournament this year, Payton has also proven to be a great leader and a great student," he said. "I'm excited to see what the future holds for him."
 When it comes to performing off the mat, Tucker has also proven to be a great football player.
 Although the team had a tough season this past fall, Tucker made sure his presence on the field was known each week. As the Wolves starting middle linebacker, he averaged just over 18 tackles a game and finished his senior year leading the team with a total of 146 tackles.
 During this time, Tucker had 10 tackles for loss, three fumble recoveries, one interception and one blocked kick. By the time the season came to an end, not only did he earn first-team all-state, but he was also selected to represent the South in the 2020 Shrine Bowl.
 Between doing everything that's required to be a great athlete, Tucker also makes the time to maintain a 3.0 GPA in the classroom. During his free time, he likes to help out around the community by volunteering at local youth sports camps.
 "I really enjoy that," he said. "Just knowing that I can help out and be a mentor to some of the younger guys is very rewarding."
 Moving forward, Tucker will remain close to home, at least for the next two years as he has signed on to continue his wrestling career at Western Wyoming Community College.

He was incredibly loved and respected by his family and his colleagues for a life defined by deep intelligence, compassion, and integrity. He was a proud graduate of The University of Virginia Medical School and spent the majority of his career practicing in the Shenandoah Valley. His care was always gentle, full of compassion, and he gave never-ending support for every patient he encountered. He loved life, the outdoors, everything Christmas, and most of all, being Opa to his grandchildren.      He was predeceased by his parents, Benjamin Beiler and Lena Beiler Glick; brother, Warren; and sister, Barbara.      Dr. Beiler is survived by his wife and greatest love, Lisa Kern Beiler; children, Kevin Beiler and wife Maja, Kristen Beiler Thomas, Linval Shakes, Ryan Shuler and wife Melissa, and Jaime Lucchetti and husband Andrew; grandchildren, Kiona and Iris Beiler, Daniel, Isaac and Grace Thomas, Rohan, Jamal, Elijah, and Braelynn Shakes, Luke and Grayson Shuler, and Isla, Liviana, and Hannah Lucchetti.

The family would like to share a special thanks to Dr. Ryan Gentzler, his nurse, Kelly; Dr. Kerry Alexander; and all of the staff at the Emily Couric Cancer Center. We also express our deepest thanks and love to Legacy Hospice; especially to Amy Cash for being with Omar and Lisa around the clock, and to his nurse, Diane, for being there in his greatest time of need and making things as peaceful as possible for him. They were truly angels on his shoulders and carried him through his journey into his eternal life with such grace and love, just like the life he lived. Thank you to each of you for the excellent care and compassion for Omar during his difficult days. We will be eternally grateful.      Lisa would also like to thank her wonderful family and friends for all their support and love during this very difficult time. Their kindness will never be forgotten.

“OESC has asked if you had this experience — if you are out there and offer someone a job and they turn the job down — please let them know,” Kouplen said. “And frankly, that worker will become ineligible for unemployment benefits. Now, if they have a legitimate reason — a health concern or something like that — that’s a different ballgame. But if it’s just a matter of ‘I’m making the same money, I’d rather stay at home’ — that is clearly not what unemployment is designed to do.”
 Kouplen said the practice is a longstanding one at OESC, and that workers may file administrative appeals in those cases.
 The state’s economy and unemployment system will not be able to handle prolonged unemployment claims at the level it is currently at and it will be difficult to get the state’s economy up and running again without an adequate number of workers, Kouplen said, which necessitates making sure people return to their jobs.
 “I know that can seem a little bit harsh, but the challenge becomes we’re trying to balance our unemployment insurance fund, we’re trying to balance getting businesses back up and going, and we’re trying to balance the welfare of that unemployed individual, all three,” Kouplen said. “So if everyone stays on unemployment extensively, we cannot reopen the economy and we’re going to see businesses go under en masse.”
 Last week, Gov. Kevin Stitt rolled out a three-phase plan to begin removing restrictions on individuals and businesses that were implemented as a result of COVID-19. The first phase, which begins Friday, will allow the reopening of theaters, restaurants, entertainment venues, gyms and other businesses that have mostly been closed since late March.
 Critics have argued the state is reopening too early, which could put workers forced back into jobs because their unemployment ended in a tough spot. Though many business leaders praised the move, others, such as the Oklahoma Medical Association, said it is too soon to reopen.
 “No business has to open until they’re ready,” Kouplen said. “So these are just guidances, these are not requirements. You don’t have to open up until you’re ready. If a business wants to be more strict than what are on these guidances, that’s fine. That is up to that business. We think that customers will go to businesses that are more careful than others because they will feel more safer.”
 There are three reasons to move forward with reopening, Kouplen said. First, because of the mental health issues caused by the measures. Second, Kouplen said, is the federal money for businesses affected by COVID-19, such as the Payroll Protection Program, runs out in 8 weeks.
 “If at the end of 8 weeks, if our businesses are not up and going and generating cash flow, we have a real problem as a state,” Kouplen said. “That’s the urgency we have in getting this going. We want to be safe, but we want to open our economy back up.”
 As the restrictions and measures are rolled back, Kouplen said, state officials will be monitoring hospitalization, infection and other data related to COVID-19. If things begin trending downward, Kouplen said, the other phases, which are spaced in two week intervals, will be halted.
 Once the state begins reopening, Kouplen said, it’s likely that customers will trend toward businesses that keep protections in place. However, it is up to each individual city whether restrictions on businesses there continue, he said.
 “Gov. Stitt really, really believes in personal choice and the value of the market. So our goal as a state is to give guidance,” Kouplen said. “It’s not the Governor’s desire to be heavy-handed. We’re going to leave that to each individual city. Our goal is just to lay out guidances and we believe that our businesses will do the right thing and make the right decisions.”
