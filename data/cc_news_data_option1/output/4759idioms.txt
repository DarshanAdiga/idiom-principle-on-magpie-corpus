However, while the programs continue, places like the tennis center and facilities like it around the state anxiously await some clarity from Lamont.
 For example, The Olympic Taekwondo Academy in Rocky Hill may have to prohibit in-studio instruction.
 “Not allowing people to have face to face contact. We are thinking of just going to zoom classes and seeing how that goes to us,” said Stella Cannata, manager of the Olympic Taekwondo Academy.
 Many of Connecticut’s local park and recreation departments have been feeling a big pinch from COVID-19.
 “It’s made everyone’s job difficult; nothing is the same anymore. This place would be packed on a Friday. We just aren’t able to do it with what’s going on unfortunately,” said Dan Lynch, director of Orange Parks and Recreation.
 Sports like tennis have actually seen an uptick in participation. The game’s availability and proper spacing seems to make it ideal for playing in a pandemic.
 “Safety is the priority. We don’t want anyone sick and we want to still give people a little bit of fun,” said Ioana-Lyes, manager of the Glastonbury Tennis Club.
 The guidance is in effect from Monday, November 23 through January 19, 2021.

In seeking a reason for the improvement, the difference in personnel can’t be ignored.
 Dunlap, who was acquired three days after the first game, had two sacks and three of Seattle’s seven quarterback hits.
 Adams, who missed the first game because of injury, had a quarterback hit and forced an intentional-grounding call that helped set up a fourth-quarter safety.
 And Green (40) and Harrison (26), who didn’t play in the first game, combined for 66 snaps on a defensive line that is playing the best it has all season.
 And as linebacker Bobby Wagner said, the Seahawks made note of what worked well for Arizona in the first game, specifically in the running game, and tried to take that away.
 “We saw the plays that they got us the first go around, and I think that they ran some of the similar things," Wagner said. “It was just going downhill, and not playing on your heels, but attacking them. Bringing the fight to them and playing on their side of the ball, which I think we did."

More than a century after the commission of the genocide of the Armenians by the Ottoman rulers of 1915, the same people are again victims of two authoritarian regimes which, in Baku as in Ankara, exalt inter-ethnic hatred to endow their undivided power with a new bloody trophy. The fate of the Armenians has just been brutally damaged in Nagorno-Karabakh, a region they call Artsakh. Humble and proud people have lived there for more than two millennia, irreducibly attached to their harsh and magnificent land. They wanted to continue their existence where their ancestors had built their homes, schools and admirable monasteries, in the heart of impregnable mountains and hard plowed plains. Without any human consideration, Recep Tayyip Erdogan's Turkey and Ilham Aliev's Azerbaijan have strived to destroy this legitimate aspiration. For the Armenians, Karabakh represents above all a people; with its ancestral culture, its music, its dances and its desire to join the march of the world by opening up. For the authorities in Baku and Ankara, it is above all a territory; on which the flag of Azerbaijan must fly at all costs, be it by receiving the support of Turkish special forces, by sending volleys of kamikaze drones to crush civilian targets or by resorting to jihadist mercenaries paid to kill. There is now evidence that Azerbaijan used cluster munitions prohibited by international law. The fight was totally unequal. The Armenians did not want this war, but they were forced to fight for their survival. For the Azeri regime, it is only a matter of nationalist pride. The leader of Azerbaijan was clear in his intentions when he said in the early days of the conflict: “We are hunting them like dogs. He repeated this same sentence after the exodus of civilian populations he provoked in Artsakh, declaring himself proud to have kept this horrible promise. In the twenty-first century, such a detestation of human beings, such exaltation of hatred, arouses the deepest indignation and is absolutely no longer necessary.

The organization projects only about 122,000 Illinois residents plan to travel by plane, meaning about 95% of travelers are expected to hit the road. The same goes for the nation, with forecasts showing about 2.4 million Americans traveling by plane.
 “Many, many people are doing the wait-and-see approach to travel instead of thinking about it three weeks or a month or more out in advance,” Hart said. “With Thanksgiving, and COVID-19 cases on the rise, people are definitely thinking twice.”

This isn't the first leak to hint at more DLC characters, and it likely won't be the last. However, for now, while there's plenty of credible leaks pointing towards more DLC characters, there are no credible leaks pointing towards who these characters could be.

 That said, for now, take everything here with a grain of salt. Nothing here is official information. However, datamining leaks have accurately revealed and spoiled every DLC character so far. Every character that has been added so far has been leaked ahead of time with 100 percent accuracy, and all of these leaks have come straight from the game's files.
 At the moment of publishing, neither NetherRealm Studios nor WB Games have commented on this latest leak, and it's unlikely they will, as neither have commented on any previous leaks. However, if this changes, we will be sure to update the story with whatever is provided. In the meantime, for more coverage on the game click here or scroll down to the links below:

AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — The Texas State Board of Education on Friday approved teaching middle schoolers about birth control but decided against providing students with information on consent, sexual orientation and gender identity. The education board's changes were the first to sex education curriculum in Texas in more than 20 years. The revisions include teaching seventh and eighth graders about the effectiveness of birth control in preventing pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections. Currently only high schoolers get such lessons, though health courses aren’t required for graduation. The new standards go into effect in 2022.

I would repeat his inanities to mock them, but that would risk giving them more credence than they deserve. The years have been as cruel to Rudy as Rudy has been to them; he entered the Trump echo chamber some time ago and now appears physically incapable of sensing anything outside it.
 Sure, there were signs of slippage in his mayoralty and post-mayoralty, but I honestly never expected him to fall this low, because among Giuliani’s strengths were his unwillingness to suffer fools, his reliance on an inner compass, his rejection of easy answers from the right wing and left wing alike. At his core, he never seemed like anyone’s lemming.
 Sure, the mayor always had a tendency to inflate numbers — he had this tic of saying an almost true statistic, then following it for effect with two, three or four numbers that were even further from reality. But he also had a willingness to speak truths that others in this often reflexively liberal city shied away from, such as the fact that unclean streets and parks and seemingly low-level crimes could be major irritants to the general public, irritants that demanded an effective government response. Meantime, he championed strong gun laws and a humane approach to immigration, against the tide of the party with which he identified.
 All along, he believed, with some justification, that the press and establishment pols of New York City were ideologically lazy and almost hard- wired to go against him, while the people were often with him. Culturally, that made him a mini-Trump, gleefully shredding the dominant dogma to the thrall of his supporters.
 Like many former Giuliani staffers, I’ve written critically of Rudy. He absolutely deserves it. But I also understand why some people hesitate.
 In leading an administration made up of Democrats, Republicans and independents, Giuliani did a lot of good.
 He was personally decent to those who worked for him; you can’t say that about some politicians. In the daily course of business, I made plenty of mistakes, as I still do, and can’t recall being berated after doing so. I remember him treating me with respect, and I saw him do the same to others in his orbit, no matter what job they did.
 During my time in City Hall, my father had to have a serious operation. I had no reason to believe the mayor was even aware of it. He called me during recovery and wished my family well. That kind of decency breeds a lasting sense of loyalty.

School trustee under fire again - this time for offensive slur at Chilliwack journalists

Ralph V. Smith, passed away peacefully, surrounded by his family on November 18, 2020 at the age of 86. Ralph was born to Louis and Edna Smith on February 14, 1934 and was the sixth of 13 children. He was preceded in death by his parents; sister, Beverly; brothers, Art, Clifford, Wayne and Roger and son-in- law Rob Moyer. Ralph is survived by sisters; Lorreta Randall of Kansas City, MO; Lois (and Bob) Stallsworth of Richmond, VA; Lola Johanson of Albert Lea, MN and Fern Giles of Kansas City, MO; and brothers; Raymond (and Sharon) Smith of Blaine, MN; Johnny Smith of Waterloo, IA; and Rodney Smith of Blaine, MN. Ralph graduated from Albert Lea High School in 1952. He married Sharron Miller in 1957 and they had 4 children together. Ralph enlisted in the US Army, spending time in San Antonio, TX. Upon discharge, he enrolled at Mankato State Teachers College where he graduated in 1961. He received his Masters in Education degree from Winona State in 1965. He spent one-year teaching high school history and coaching baseball in Canton, MN. He then moved his young family to Stewartville in 1963 and would spend the next 30 years there teaching Social Studies and serving as Head Baseball Coach. He truly loved working with kids in the classroom as well as on the baseball diamond. Stewartville was always home, and he bled maroon and gold for his Tigers. Ralph was an avid sports fan for the Minnesota Gophers, Vikings, Twins and Timberwolves. However, Grandpa Smitty was the SUPER FAN for his grandchildren's sporting events and was active in all their lives. It was not uncommon for him to share their recent accomplishments with anyone who showed interest, even strangers in grocery stores! He was proud of each and every one of them. Ralph loved to hunt and fish with his fellow teaching buddies and their children as they joined the group. He looked forward to the opening of deer hunting season where he could "hold court" preparing dinner for the entire hunting party. Ralph's greatest joy was his family. One of his highest accomplishments was raising his four children as a single parent after he and Sharron were divorced. He adored his children, grandchildren and great grandchildren. He is survived by his children; Jodi Carr of Palo Alto, CA; Gregg (Melanie) Smith of Wayzata, MN; Carri Moyer of Menomonie, WI; and Shelly Paulson of Rochester, MN and his grandchildren; Brandon (Amanda) Smith, Jordan (Brenna) Smith, Nicole Smith, Nick (Jen) Moyer, Casandra (Matt) Williams, Dustin Paulson, Mackenzie Paulson and his great grandchildren; Avery and Louis Smith, Jaxon Smith, Logan and Zach Moyer, Harrison and Lincoln Williams, and Elly Paulson. Ralph's family would like to extend sincere thanks to the wonderful staff at Lake Minnetonka Presbyterian Homes. They provided wonderful care for him this past year. A celebration of life was held on Saturday, November 21, 2020. Memorials are preferred to a program that Ralph nurtured for 30 years.

On the flip side of this is the McLaren 540C. It's a fantastic mid-engined supercar in McLaren's Sports Series, but whereas the SLR was king of its day, the 540C is the entry-level model. That said, it's no slouch with a twin- turbocharged 3.8-liter V8 generating 540 horsepower. It's also considerably lighter than the beefy SLR, and when you peruse the stats on paper, the two cars are actually quite comparable.
