Last week, we here at FishOn received a plaintive cry for help from one of our loyal readers. We immediately stopped what we were doing, dropped the votes we were counting and sprung into action with alacrity, which is almost as painful as it sounds. Mark Glendening wanted to know why a big honking bird was standing on his roof’s skylight in the midnight hour and what kind of bird it might be.
 We flashed the bird signal over Gotham and FishOners everywhere (well, here) responded in droves (well, four) to our request for avian assistance.
 First up was Mark Ring, lobsterman and closet ornithologist. Ring informed us that many birds fly at night during migrations and hazarded a guess — based on Glendening’s description — that the bird in question is probably a night heron, which is a smaller version of the great blue heron.
