Lionel Messi says the attitude shown by Barcelona in their 5-0 win over Deportivo Alaves on Sunday is the benchmark for next season.
 After proving unable to keep pace with Real Madrid since the resumption, Barca ultimately surrendered their LaLiga crown in midweek after an insipid 2-1 home defeat to Osasuna.
 They ended their domestic campaign in some style, though, Messi scoring twice and further goals from Ansu Fati, Luis Suarez and Nelson Semedo sealing the win.
 Messi was impressed by his team-mates' response and says the commitment shown on Sunday should be the bare minimum as they look to reclaim their title next season.
 He told Movistar: "As coach (Quique Setien) said the other day, we have had some very good games, some very good moments. But we have to do that more consistently now.
 "Today, we saw something else. It was a difficult game to play and the team responded differently in attitude and commitment. It is a step forward for what is to come.
 "We did a lot of self-criticism and realised a lot of things. We didn't have a great season.  
 "Today is a step forward in terms of attitude and commitment, which is what you always have to have. You have to at least match the attitude of any rival; if not more."
 While their domestic duties are done for 2019-20, Barca now switch their focus to the Champions League. They host Napoli in the second leg of their last-16 tie at Camp Nou on August 8.

Panjab University's Institute of Social Science Education and Research (ISSER) on Monday organised a webinar on 100 years of Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD).
 Speaking about challenges being faced by the political party, Amarjit Singh Narang, former registrar and retired professor of political science at IGNOU, New Delhi, said, "The party has failed to address farmers' issues, despite claiming to be a party for farmers. Federalisation of polity and BJP emerging as the dominant party has allowed SAD to shed its anti-Centre politics and share power at the Centre," he said.
 Ashutosh Kumar, chairperson of political science department, PU, said, "SAD, as a 'Panthic party', was formed by a religious congregation to serve religious and political interests of Sikhs. But, given territorial and demographic changes in Punjab at the time of Partition and after, the party found itself trapped at the crossroads of region and religion. As a result, it transitioned from pursuing the politics of 'representation' in colonial Punjab to the pursuit of 'a territorial homeland' for the Sikh minority in post- Partition India."

The minister's reaction came after it emerged that at least four special assistants to the prime minister hold dual nationalities.
 Chaudhry went on to add that the problems the incumbent PTI-led government currently faced were created by its own members. However, the Pakistani people had pinned high hopes and expectations from the ruling party, he added.
 Members of the PTI and Opposition continued to snipe at each other after the government last week disclosed details of the assets and nationalities of Prime Minister Imran Khan's advisers and special assistants.  
 Information Minister Shibli Faraz in a bid by the government bid to "boost transparency" had announced Saturday that information was now available for public viewing. The details have been shared on the Cabinet Division website as instructed by the premier, he had noted.
 It was revealed that four aides — Nadeem Babar, Tania Aidrus, Zulfi Bukhari, and Shahzad Syed Qasim — possessed other nationalities.
 Chaudhry, the science minister, also took a jibe at the Opposition parties, saying: "The PML-N does not even know who is going to lead them, whereas for the PPP, [former president] Asif Zardari has worked hard to make it 'Sindh's party'.
 "Now, [PPP Chairperson] Bilawal Bhutto is trying hard to make it an only 'interior' Sindh's party."
 Talking about the Pakistan Television Network (PTV), the minister said the national broadcaster had no business plan but had increased fees. "I have expressed my concerns in the cabinet," he added.
 ## Pakistan's first civil defence R&D; project
 Speaking of the developmental projects initiated by the incumbent government, the federal minister said Pakistan's first civil defence Research and Development (R&D;) project has commenced, under which 10 police stations in Islamabad have been redesigned.
 The police would be given drones for patrolling purposes — which is expected to reduce street crimes, he added.
 The minister explained that an agriculture service company would be established with 600 people where soil testing and drone spray would be the top priority, keeping in view the recent locust attacks threatening the country's agricultural growth.
 "We are inviting Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) for investments in the agri sector," he said, adding that Pakistan imported over Rs2 billion worth of electromedical devices every year, on which an additional $1 billion were spent in repairs.
 "Special Economic Zones are being set up in Sialkot, Karachi, and Lahore in line with our vision to boost development in the country," he maintained.

Lionel Messi secured a record seventh Pichichi award after the Barcelona star finished the 2019-20 season as the leading scorer in LaLiga.
 The Argentinian equalled Athletic Bilbao great Telmo Zarra's record of six awards last season, but he is now out on his own after another superb campaign in front of goal.
 His double in the final-day 5-0 rout of Deportivo Alaves took him to 25 goals in 33 appearances.
 It was not enough to guide Barca to a third consecutive title, however, with Real Madrid pulling away in the final weeks to seal top spot.
 Madrid striker Karim Benzema was four goals behind on 21, while Villarreal's Gerard Moreno was third with 18 goals, two ahead of Messi's Barca team-mate Luis Suarez.

Antonio Conte hit out at Serie A chiefs for their scheduling of Inter's fixtures and accused the match officials of making a big error in Sunday's 2-2 draw with Roma.
 The visitors salvaged a late point at Stadio Olimpico through Romelu Lukaku's penalty after Leonardo Spinazzola and Henrikh Mkhitaryan cancelled out Stefan de Vrij's opener.
 It was Inter's fourth match in 11 days, each of those games in the late kick- off slot, whereas title rivals Juventus have had a four-day rest ahead of Monday's clash with Lazio.
 And Conte feels that playing late in the day has been a big disadvantage for his side given the quick turnaround in fixtures.
 "I want people to look at the fixture list for Inter," he told Sky Sport Italia. "Our calendar is insane and made to cause us problems.
 "We are always playing late at night, the teams we face always have an extra day of rest compared to us. These are facts.
 "It's an anomaly, so if you are honest, look at what happened in the last round. Evidently Inter weren't present when the fixture list was drawn up, because our calendar is crazy.
 "Some teams get five days of rest. We play late at night in an away fixture and basically end up getting home at 4am.
 "Everyone has to make compromises, but it's always Inter that ends up getting the short straw. Always. It's funny, that. If someone has to get a slap, it's always Inter."
 Inter were a goal ahead before Spinazzola equalised in first-half stoppage time, the strike allowed to stand despite Aleksandar Kolarov catching Lautaro Martinez in the build-up.
 Conte was unhappy with the decision but held back from being overly critical of the officials, who awarded Inter a late penalty for Spinazzola's clumsy challenge on Victor Moses.
 "It's not a dubious situation. It was a very clear situation," he said. "The Roma player does not get the ball, he gets Lautaro's ankle.
 "I have the utmost respect for referees – they too are going through a strange and anomalous situation, so I don't think they deserve that kind of criticism.
 "They too can make mistakes, and the referee tonight made a mistake, it happens.
 "Of course, if you go into the break at 1-1 with the knowledge it was an unjust situation, it is going to make you angry."
 The draw does little for Inter's Scudetto hopes, leaving them five points behind Juventus ahead of the reigning champions' game in hand against fourth- placed Lazio.
 They are now assured of a top-four finish and a place in next season's Champions League, however, and Conte called for Inter's season to be put into perspective.
 "We are talking about a team that in my view is doing some very good things," he said.
 "Aside from second place, if you look at the goals scored and conceded, we are in the Champions League with four rounds to spare and 14 points clear of fifth place.
 "Let's not forget Inter started with the same objectives for the season as Roma and Napoli.
 "Serie A has become very competitive indeed and everyone is set up to have great campaigns. Only four go into the Champions League.
 "If people say Inter are below par, then what do you say about the other teams who didn't finish in the top four?"
