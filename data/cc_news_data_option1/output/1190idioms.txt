The Jharkhand government on Wednesday assured the people that it has sufficient food materials stock which can last for several days,and said there is nothing to worry about. The comforting words came from state's Chief Secretary D K Tiwari in the wake of 21-day nationwide lockdown necessitated by coronavirus pandemic.
 "Efforts are afoot to deliver food grains at home, he said. The officer said that the government was making available necessary commodities to the poor.
 He also appealed to the people to extend assistance to the poor living in their neighbourhood. The state government has sufficient food materials, which can last for several days, and there is nothing to be worried about," the chief secretary said.
 Reports of the Jharkhand labourers being stranded in other states are also trickling in, he said, adding the government is establishing contacts with those state governments to enable food and lodging to them. Tiwari inspected a state-level control room to deal with the lockdown situation at the Suchana Bhavan. It will do round-the-clock vigil, monitoring and tracking of calls and passing on the information to the departments or districts concerned, an official release said here.
 A Palamau report said that on the appeal of Deputy Commissioner Santanu Agrahari, the government officials in the district announced to donate 15 days of their salary in the fight against the virus. Former union minister and Hazaribagh MP Jayant Sinha also announced recommendation of Rs 30 lakh to Hazaribagh and Rs 20 lakh to Ramgarh district from his MPLAD fund to procure items like masks, individual security covers, medical apparatus and ventilators.
 He sent letters, which were released to the press, to the respective district deputy commissioners for initiating early action. In a tweet, Ranchi Deputy Commissioner Rai Mahimapat Ray said, As lots of people are asking about the way to order groceries and other necessary items. Here we are releasing the VeggiGo app. Soon the app will go live. Till then, you can use the numbers provided on the banner.
 The first day of the 21-day lockdown saw private vehicles and two-wheelers moving in the state capital before the traffic thinned down as civil and police officials made them aware of the seriousness of the lockdown in the wake of the pandemic and sought their cooperation in the fight against virus. Earlier, during the day, the state government issued rate-chart of essential commodities at the public distribution outlets amid reports of a few ration shops overcharging the consumers while some others selling them in the black market taking advantage of the lockdown prompted by the coronavirus pandemic.
 It asked the buyers to report to the officials concerned if any ration shop overcharged them. Jharkhand has not reported any coronavirus positive case so far, but the state government is taking measures to prevent COVID-19 outbreak and help citizens during the lockdown period.

However, if the stock price goes below the $0.7633 mark, then the market for VAALCO Energy, Inc. becomes much weaker. If that happens, the stock price might even plunge as low as $0.7167 for its downside target. The stock is currently in the red zone of MACD, with the indicator reading -0.1204. Traders are always alerted for the move of a stock above or below the zero line due to the fact that the reading is an indicator of the position of the short-term average relative to the long-term average. If the MACD is above the zero line, then the short-term average relative is above that of the long-term average, thus implying an upward momentum.

 We are calling on local officials throughout eastern North Carolina and the state to take more decisive action in response to this crisis to include making the bold and right decision to ask North Carolinians to shelter in place.
 This means staying close to home as much as possible and only going out if absolutely necessary, such as buying groceries or picking up medications. This is the right thing to do to save lives and is the right thing for our long- term economic interests. Community members must encourage the political bodies to be decisive, take action now and then support them.
 We would also like to thank all health care workers and every person on the front lines for their tireless efforts to care for those in need. This is a difficult time for doctors, nurses and care teams. We stand ready to care for those in our region, but we need local communities to do their part.

Back in the day when Heavy Metal singer Alice Cooper sang “School’s Out” it was a reason to celebrate.
 When Governor Roy Cooper, no relation we hope, announced Monday that school doors will be closed to students until May 15, the mood was less than celebratory in Perquimans County.
 “I would say school closures are definitely devastating to most students,” said Celia Manning, a student at Perquimans Middle School. “It’s sad that we are missing formal and possibly 8th-grade graduation. It’s also hard on students who play sports and participate in other after school activities. Plus, our spring musical was cancelled and we were really looking forward to performing. Of course, not being able to see friends face-to-face is hard as well. While we can video chat and text each other, it’s boring not seeing friends in person.”
 Superintendent Tanya Turner said based on the governor’s plans last week to close the schools, she is not surprised that the date was extended past the two-week window of March 30. She said Perquimans schools are prepared for the days and weeks to come.
 “I am optimistic in the Perquimans County Schools staff and their commitment to our students and community,” she said. “I believe that they will do everything in their power to continue teaching and learning to the best of their abilities. This is a huge shift in our current vision of education and there will be an adjustment period for teachers, students, and families. However, I am confident that we can overcome the challenge and work together to make the best out of this situation.”
 Turner said unless the governor’s orders dictate otherwise, the school system will continue to feed its students.
 “This is an essential service to our community and rewarding to our staff,” she said. “Our school nutrition and transportation departments have been superheroes in this effort. I am thankful that we are able to provide this service.”
 Teaching classes can be a challenge on any given day, but imagine teaching music – band – via video conference; now that’s something. Still, Pirates’ top notch Band Director Evan Copeland is up to the task.
 “Teaching band virtually is definitely a challenge, but I have one main goal,” he said. “I want them to play everyday. I have assignments I have sent home, but with the extension announced, I will be sending home some fun music for the kids to work on in addition with that 1 goal. Play everyday. Music is a honed skill that is only refined through practice and performance. Unfortunately the performance aspect is not a possibility for the time being. For any of my kids reading the paper, go practice!”
 As to planning for milestones like prom and graduation, Turner said it is too early to throw in the chips, call it a game.

 NEWTON -- For students, parents, teachers and others in Newton Unified School District 373, Monday was supposed to be the first day back to school after spring break.
   
 It wasn't. At least not school the way they knew it two weeks ago.
   
 On March 17, Randy Watson, the commissioner of education in Kansas, and Gov. Laura Kelly announced that all public school buildings in Kansas would be closed for the remainder of the year in response to the COVID-19 outbreak.
   
 Monday was, instead, the first day of lunch and breakfast distribution for students -- dubbed "Grab and Go" lunches by the district in emails sent to parents on Saturday and Sunday detailing where those lunches could be picked up.
   
 Families were able to get a sack lunch containing a turkey with cheese sandwich, apple, carrots and milk. Also on the menu was a breakfast for Tuesday, a muffin, yogurt and milk.
   
 That email was followed with a technology survey on Sunday, asking parents if they had internet service in the home, what company they used for cellular service and if they needed to check out a computer from the school district to help further their child's education.
   
 More steps toward providing educational services to the children of USD 373 are coming -- Monday was also the day all teachers were meeting virtually to map out what the next several weeks will look like for education in the largest school district of Harvey County.
   
 Some teachers had already set up Facebook groups for the parents and students of their classrooms to aid in communication as the district moves forward with educational services.
   
 On Friday night, superintendent Deb Hamm hosted a Facebook Live Q&A; session to get information out to those who need it. At that time, there were far more questions than answers.
   
 What she knew was that plans are in the works -- for about everything imaginable. Diplomas earned by the class of 2020 will be delivered with details still to come. Parents and students will be allowed into school buildings at some point to get their personal belongings. Special education services will continue, with how to be determined.
   
 That is what this week is for: planning.
   
 There will be more announcements this week for parents -- how much time students will work on a computer each day, how to handle other activities and how to finish off the school year among them.
   
 Some of those parents had harried looks on their faces, the toll of spring break and uncertainty ahead obvious.

People in churches are urged to pray that a solution will be found in the coming weeks to further reduce the risk.      Around the world, people want to return to some kind of security.      Many local people are already stepping up to help higher-risk and vulnerable people during the difficult time. A High Prairie church and several volunteers in the region are extending their hearts and hands to people in need. Volunteers are offering to pick up and deliver groceries and other necessities to their homes.      Good Samaritans in other areas like Slave Lake, Peace River, Falher, McLennan and smaller communities are also ready to respond in various ways.      Municipalities are doing all they can to protect residents from any health risks.      Besides the health risk, the biggest concern most people have is the economic fallout of the pandemic. Most banks and financial institutions started to close or reduce business hours March 17.      Not everyone uses online banking, especially seniors and those with little or no computer skills. They need to go to the bank to pay bills, cash cheques and deposit money.      How will this affect the economy? Some municipalities are waiving penalties on overdue utility bills. Let’s hope businesses also give relief to people who pay late.      How are you coping with COVID-19? Share your experiences with our readers. Send your stories to spn@cablecomet.com.

Jharkhand Chief Minister Hemant Soren on Wednesday said that the government has zero tolerance against sale of any item in the black market and asked officials to take stringent action against any person indulging in such practices. In a tweet, Soren asked all district Deputy Commissioners and other officials across the state to curb sale of commodities in black market as such problems from some districts were still coming in through the 24x7 state-level control room, introduced at Suchana Bhavan here.
 The officials should follow zero tolerance in initiating action against such people, he added. Soren also tweeted that a dedicated round-the-clock number0651-2282201 has been made available for the people of Jharkhand who are outside the state while 181 has been launched for the needy within the state.
 The chief minister also reviewed the 24x7 control room at the Suchana Bhavan. Earlier, during the day, the state government issued rate-chart of essential commodities at the public distribution outlets in the backdrop of the reports of a few ration shops overcharging the consumers while some others selling them in the black market taking advantage of the lockdown prompted by the coronavirus pandemic.
 It asked the buyers to report to the officials concerned if any ration shop overcharged them..

"We could quickly move towards a delivery service that would limit exposure as well as keep people at home," Roch says. "It's a proactive measure that could be in place temporarily to keep social distancing top of mind. Alternatively, a curbside service would also help."
 The province has the highest concentration of cannabis stores in the country, with more than 430 listed on as AGLC licensees. On March 17, Premier Jason Kenney declared a state of emergency and has since ordered the closure of non- essential businesses. But because cannabis stores are privately owned, the AGLC doesn't have a say in whether or not they're open. That's up to the discretion of each store's management.
 "As retail liquor and cannabis stores in Alberta are privately owned and operated, licensees/owners/operators are able to set their own health and safety policies and protocols (e.g., social distancing) in light of the COVID-19 situation," says Heather Holmen, the AGLC's manager of communications. "AGLC, as the provincial regulator, did send a bulletin to retailers last week re: proposed approaches to checking identification."
 That bulletin provides guidelines about how to check ID while maintaining a safe distance to prevent the spread of COVID-19. But there will not be accommodations for retailers to deliver or provide curbside pickup unless the province's Chief Medical Officer says so.
 "Cannabis retailers in Alberta are private businesses and we encourage those businesses, as we do with all businesses in Alberta, to follow the guidelines of Alberta's Chief Medical Officer of Health (CMOH) in their stores and practice regular sanitation," says Jerrica Goodwin, Press Secretary to Alberta's Minister of Finance, in an email. "This may include limiting the number of customers allowed in a store. At this time these measures, as recommended by the CMOH, are being implemented across Alberta. Should further action be necessary, we will act on the advice of the CMOH to protect the health and safety of all Albertans."
 Albertans can buy cannabis online from the provincial store and have it delivered by Canada Post. But Alex Krause of National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws Canada (NORML) says that doesn't go far enough to serve all Canadians.
 "Retailers deserve world-leading modern digital sales platforms where customers can access home delivery options," he says, adding that click-and- collect doesn't go far enough. "Self-service and delivery options need to be liberalized and should be made available to all Canadians."
 For now, Roch will keep the store open, but continues to be concerned about client and employee safety with the high numbers of people coming to stock up.
 "Lots of people are great, but many are incredibly careless," he says. "Even if 90 per cent are good, the 10 per cent puts us all at risk.  Implementing delivery would make sure those people stay at home, and contact rates stay low. We are assuming people are doing the right things. I can assure you they are not."

New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Wednesday that he’s also considering hotels and dormitories for treatment sites as work continues to turn the city’s Jacob K. Javits Convention Center into a temporary field hospital. In Michigan, a suburban Detroit university offered up its basketball gym for a makeshift hospital and parking lots for drive-thru testing sites.
 The first patients moved into Hotel 166 on the city’s North Side on Tuesday, but the city has not released numbers, nor has it named the other hotels that have agreed to join the effort.
 The reserved hotel rooms are intended for people who have tested positive for COVID-19 but have mild symptoms that don’t require a hospital stay. They also could be used by people awaiting test results are but unable to stay home due to the risk of spreading the virus to family members, particularly those who are vulnerable to more severe symptoms due to their age or health issues.
 “We need to build this excess network of other spaces so we can take pressure off of hospitals and reserve those acute care beds for those that are most in need of intensive medical treatment,” Mayor Lori Lightfoot said Tuesday.
 For most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, or death.
 Public health officials or hospitals will inform patients who test positive that the rooms are available, but the decision to use a room is voluntary, Mayekar said.
 No one is making public predictions about demand.
 City officials have said Chicago’s hospitals aren’t at the critical level seen in New York this week. But Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker said Tuesday that the state will need almost 38,000 additional hospital beds — double what’s available — as the number of cases continues to rise.

U.S stocks seesawed on Wednesday, digesting the previous sessions huge rebound, with investors torn as optimism about an imminent 2 trillion coronavirus package was offset by concerned about the lasting economic impact from the pandemic. The SP 500 was up 1.17 and yields on U.S. treasury securities were mainly off as markets waited for senators to vote on a 2 trillion bipartisan package of legislation to alleviate the devastating economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic, hoping it will become law quickly.The Senate was due to convene at 12 p.m. EDT 1600 GMT, though timing of the vote was unclear. The House of Representatives is expected to follow soon after. President Donald Trump supports the measure, the White House said, and has talked about reopening U.S. businesses by Easter on April 12. COMMENTS RON TEMPLE, HEAD OF U.S. EQUITY, LAZARD ASSET MANAGEMENT, NEW YORKOn the fiscal stimulus, this is very important progress but the devils also in the details. We still dont have the legislation to read for particulars in how it will be executed and there are some concerns about how long it will take for money to arrive at the households, how long will it take for small businesses to access funding. This is not the all-clear, its just material progress. Until we know we can go back to work safely and that we can go to restaurants and go to stores and actually engage with other humans in close proximity, I dont think you can make an economic call or a market call. Its premature to be trying to call the bottom, and trying to use past crises and looking at valuation levels, while it can be instructive, there arent any parallels historically to use given that we dont know how long or extensive these lockdowns might be. We also dont know how widespread, how severe the impact will be on the economy.Were trying to figure out what unemployment claims might be this week and were coming up with a number that could be over 3 million and perhaps as high as 3.4 million. Last week it was 281,000. When you think about those kind of numbers and that kind of magnitude of an increase in unemployment and shock to the system, its way too early to be trying to call a bottom or prognosticate how much further the market could go down. RANDY WATTS, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, WILLIAM ONEILCO, NEW YORK The market would like to see that bill get passed and put that behind them. I think the market may be a little disappointed that this is still not done yet. And until its signed by the House and agreed to by all three parties, theres still some uncertainty. Clearly investors would like to see the bill committed, done and put into action.In the short run, the market still going to stay very volatile until one of three things happens - either the number of deaths and the number of new infections in the U.S, peak, until there is some kind of a cure or vaccine developed or until the U.S. economy begins to reopen. Investors are also having a very hard time figuring out what underlying earnings are for the for the U.S. economy right now. Its been very very hard for investors right now to forecast corporate profits. When that occurs on the market, its going to have a higher degree of volatility.Theres been significant technical damage done to the market. I dont think the market is going to totally repair itself, quickly. It was a straight move down, but we dont expect it to be a straight move up. Its going to take time. ANDREA CICIONE, HEAD OF STRATEGY, TS LOMBARD, LONDON Obviously, the U.S. deciding to go twice the size with the fiscal stimulus declaration anticipated, is definitely good news.Whats remarkable in this particular crisis, compared to 2008 or to previous crisis, is the response by policy because the speed with which theyve revamped existing programs and introduced new ones is completely unprecedented. Clearly, authorities have learned from the 2008 global financial crisis. I think theres no reason to be too optimistic at this stage. The market of course, has come through the initial shock phase, but still we have to go through the consequences space before we even start thinking about recovery.We still havent seen evidence that things are improving enough in terms of contagion. And thats to be optimistic at this stage. We also havent fully appreciated how far this recession will go, not just because of the shocks of global demand but also because of second round effects such as rising unemployment, slashing of capex, and potentially even tightening financial conditions because of companies defaults or being downgraded.KEVIN LOANE, SENIOR ECONOMIST, FATHOM CONSULTING IN A NOTE TO INVESTORS Assets appear cheap. On the surface, this may encourage a buy-the-dip mentality. However, they remain more expensive than in the trough of previous historical downturns including the Global Financial Crisis, the aftermath of the dot-com bubble and the early 90s US recession. While valuations are not always a great timing indicator, the outlook for asset prices, while more balanced, remains skewed to the downside.Investors may be complacent about the severity of the initial shock that awaits us. Admittedly, markets broadly shrugged off historic declines in survey measures of activity in Europe and the US, released yesterday. However, there remains a risk that investors underestimate the first-round impact on employment. SEBASTIEN GALY, SENIOR MACRO STRATEGIST, NORDEA ASSET MANAGEMENT, LUXEMBOURG There seems to be a view that this is as bad as its going to get. That doesnt mean were not still in a high volatility environment--the crisis will be long, the data is going to be very poor, its still going to be a difficult market.Weve essentially recommended for our client base to make incremental changes, to start moving some of their allocation back into equities and moving some into alternative assets.

The sheer hubris of the chattering political class of beltway pundits has served to separate the have-less from the have-nots, to make those just getting by more blind to the situation of those who aren’t.

The United States on Wednesday said it has urged Saudi Arabia to reassure oil and financial markets as the world grapples with a coronavirus pandemic that has paralysed major economies. The appeal was made by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in a telephone conversation Tuesday with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the State Department said.Oil prices have plunged as economies grind to a halt due to the pandemic. But the decline has also been fuelled by a price war between the Saudis and Russia. President Donald Trump, who is seeking re-election in November, has welcomed lower gasoline prices for US consumers but the United States is also worried about its shale oil producers.The Secretary stressed that as a leader of the G20 and an important energy leader, Saudi Arabia has a real opportunity to rise to the occasion and reassure global energy and financial markets when the world faces serious economic uncertainty, the department said in a statement. We agreed all countries need to work together to contain the pandemic and stabilize energy markets, Pompeo himself tweeted on Wednesday.On Thursday, Saudi Arabia is hosting a virtual summit of G20 leaders on the health crisis sweeping the world because of the coronavirus..

Other possible projections are far worse. Last week, California Gov. Gavin Newsom issued orders completely locking down his entire state in order to halt the spread of the disease.

Forty years ago this week, East Brady was rocking and rolling.
 The Bulldogs were home celebrating their PIAA state basketball championship, won over the weekend at Hersheypark Arena. In the Class A final, the Bulldogs beat Darby Township, 72-66, on what was Saturday, March 22, 1980.
 It was the first-ever title won by a Clarion County team in the seventh try, including East Brady’s 1968 run to the final before losing to Middletown, 78-48, in the Class B final. Others who came up one win short were Clarion in 1962, Union in 1967 and 1974, Karns City in 1972 and A-C Valley in 1973. The only D9 team to win a title to that point was Kane in Class B in 1946.
 Another deep run into the state playoffs was certainly an expectation for East Brady, coached by John Jamison. The core of the team had Jim Kelly’s younger twin brothers Dan and Kevin, along with Mike Vasbinder, Bill Olcus and Dave Kerschbaumer, along with sixth man Dean Fair.
 The previous season, the Bulldogs got to within one win of playing for the state title, but fell to eventual runner-up Conemaugh Township, the District 5 champion, 63-57, in overtime. In 1977 and 1978, the Bulldogs lost in the quarterfinal round, so deep state playoff runs weren’t out of the ordinary.
 Out of the gate for the 1979-80 season, the Bulldogs started the year 6-2, their only losses of the season coming to Elk County Christian (47-45) and nearby rival Redbank Valley (64-60).
 Against the other Bulldogs, East Brady spun the loss into a turning point of the season.
 "We lost to them 64-60 or something like that they threw a little press at us that we didn't handle and we just looked at each other and said that's not going to happen again and that was basically the last game we lost all year," Kerschbaumer told D9Sports.Com, which published a story on the season in December.
 Indeed, East Brady ran the table with 15 straight wins to close the regular season before seven postseason victories claimed the state title. Along the way, the Bulldogs routed Union, 76-39, bringing out a good postgame quote from Knights coach Don Stemmerich.
 “They would beat us 19 out of 20 times, but I don’t think they are 40 points better than us,” Stemmerich said. “There is so much animosity between the players because East Brady has beaten Union the last two years for the football championship that the players couldn’t see straight. They were so pumped up they couldn’t even tie their shoes. You can’t play basketball that way.”
 Meanwhile, Redbank Valley went on to win its second-ever D9 title in Class 2A and first since 1975. It was the first “open” playoff in D9 that year as it still is today when teams could opt into the postseason regardless of record. Prior to that, brackets were pre-set and smaller.

What would happen to this 25% pro-secession figure if there were organized efforts to build around that idea? There was, bear in mind, the ‘Yes’ movement in 2016, for California to secede from the Union. Also, when the poll was conducted a few years ago, the situation was bad but not the catastrophe we are upon today. This catastrophe, whether engineered or not, has been a fascinating subject. It is unlikely that the Coronavirus is the cause of it, but rather the convenient timing of such appears to be a good reason to telegraph an emergency situation to the elites that now is the time to institute a series of socialist/corporatist/fascist (read: planned economy or distributist) changes to save the system by transforming it.

It was one of many late 19th-early 20th century companies trying to make a go of it in the auto business, but it was making a pretty poor go of it. In 1908 Thomas hired a bright young cash register salesman from Dayton named Hugh Chalmers to boost its fortunes. Chalmers was named president. Later that year he bought out Thomas completely and changed the name of the company, creating the Chalmers Auto Company of Detroit.

Now that spring has arrived, delightful thoughts come to mind as I think of the magnificent plants that illuminate the garden. I love large shrubs that take center stage but I also adore those early perennials and minor bulbs that brighten smaller spaces. These are ones that are not grown as often, those rarer jewels that need to be lauded. I do not have as many as I would like but some of those that I do grow, I want to sing their praises.      One of the first to break the ground is Ranunculus ficaria "Brazen Hussy," a plant I first saw when visiting a garden in eastern Virginia. This deer- resistant spring perennial emerges with glossy dark burgundy foliage that contrasts well with the cheerful daffodil-yellow flowers. The stark contrast between the foliage and the flowers sets this plant apart and makes it stand out from a distance. I have had it for about 10 years and it comes back each February like clockwork and then it disappears, as the temperatures get warmer. I have read it is invasive but I still have the two plants that I purchased from Plants Delights and it is not invasive where I have them growing.      Bloodroot, (Sanguinaria) is a charming woodland plant that emerges and quickly shows off white flowers that stand out against the brown leaf litter. I also am attracted to the shape of the leaves and find them to be quite attractive and interesting. The leaves grow larger as the summer progresses, sporting deeply cut lobes that are quite eye-catching. This is a North American woodland perennial that is called bloodroot because it has a red sap that oozes from the roots when cut. Native American basket makers used the sap as a source of red dye. However, they did not use it as face paint because it is toxic if rubbed onto the skin.      Many of my gardening friends grow Virginia Bluebells, (Mertensia virginica), a cherished native that delights us in spring with nodding clusters of pink buds that open to sky blue flowers. These charming bell-shaped flowers have cool, soft green foliage making a beautiful display in a shaded area of the garden. You need to enjoy them quickly because as the flowers fade, so does the foliage and, before you know it, they disappear and go dormant until the following spring.      Brunnera has also become a favorite of mine for the shade garden. This trouble-free plant has dainty blue flowers that resemble forget-me-nots. The flowers stand high above the foliage on thin stems that sway in a gentle breeze. The one I grow is called Brunnera "Jack Frost" and was chosen the perennial of the year in 2012 by the Perennial Plant Association. This hardy plant is grown not only for the flowers but also for the veined heart-shaped leaves that are green and white and, if it does not get too hot and dry, they look pretty all summer long. My husband thinks these leaves are caladiums leaves in the summer, a plant he wants me to grow. I do not tell him that those variegated showy leaves are not what he thinks. What he does not know will not hurt him.      Phlox divaricata, a perennial with delightful blue or white flowers, is another woodland native which forms mats of foliage with stems that typically reach 12 inches tall. My friend Pat Burton introduced me to this plant and told me to be sure and purchase the variety called "Blue Moon." It is a lovely native phlox groundcover featuring clouds of rich violet-blue blooms that float above green foliage. It has a slight fragrance to wake up one's senses, and it flowers in March and April where I live. It is a perfect addition to a rock garden or any shady spot where it can slowly naturalize. I have it by a stream and I am hoping that one day, the mats will become large enough that they drape over the rocks lining the stream.      If you like to plant bulbs or corms, you should try planting Erythronium, which is also called Trout Lilies or Dogtooth Violet. I grow one called "Pagoda" which bears graceful sulfur yellow flowers with a reddish-brown ring at the center. The flower is shaped like a tiny lily and the leaves are a beautiful bright green. I grow mine in part shade with rich woodsy soil. These deer and rodent resistant plants only last for a short time because, by late May, the Dogtooth Lilies have gone dormant for the summer.   Think about planting some to brighten up a small space where you want a little something extra. Many of them are called spring ephemerals because the plants last only a brief time. They bloom and die back and go dormant and disappear from view shortly after they stop flowering. I enjoy them and I hope I always have a place for a few in the garden. These early charmers are a joy to grow.      Betty Montgomery is a master gardener and author of "Hydrangeas: How To Grow, Cultivate & Enjoy," and "A Four-Season Southern Garden."

Canadas C27 billion 18.8 billion aid package will give people affected by the coronavirus outbreak C2,000 a month and delay student loan repayments, among other measures to boost the economy, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Wednesday. After almost a day of wrangling, the House of Commons agreed early on Wednesday to approve the stimulus. The Canada Emergency Response Benefit bill was being debated in the Senate.We are hopeful that the system will be up and running by April 6 and the checks and direct deposits will be flowing days after that, Trudeau told reporters outside his house. A few dozen legislators - maintaining social distancing in the face of the highly contagious disease - backed the measures after the Liberal government agreed to remove proposals that would have given Ottawa emergency spending powers without Parliamentary approval until the end of 2021.The bill - which also includes C55 billion in the form of tax deferrals - must now be approved by the unelected Senate, which will meet later on Wednesday. Government officials say they anticipate senators will quickly approve the measures.A total of 2,792 Canadians have been diagnosed with the coronavirus and 27 have died, while more than a million people have applied for unemployment benefits in less than two weeks. Trudeau, who unveiled the stimulus package last week, said on Tuesday the crisis meant the government needed flexibility to react quickly.But after almost 18 hours of wrangling, and faced with opposition threats to drag out approval of the aid, Trudeau officials agreed to dilute some of their demands. Because we fought back, the Trudeau government has backed down from its power grab, said Pierre Poilievre, finance spokesman for the official opposition Conservatives.The modified bill caps Ottawas emergency spending power at six months. It also says the House of Commons finance committee - which is controlled by opposition legislators - can probe government spending and force Parliament back in 48 hours if it thinks abuses are occurring. Trudeaus Liberals only have a minority in the House of Commons and rely on other parties to govern.Once senators have voted for the bill, it needs formal assent from the Governor-General, the representative of Queen Elizabeth, Canadas head of state. This is a formality.

Sterling fell by half a percentage point to below 1.17 on Wednesday as investors adjusted their views to reflect the extent of coronavirus outbreak in Britain.More than 400 people have died from the coronavirus in Britain and more than 8,000 have been tested positive, putting further pressure on its health care system, which lacks enough equipment to help patients, as well as on the British economy. Sterlings weakness is a function of how deep and severe the virus curve is going to get, John Velis, FX and macro strategist at BNY Mellon, said.Velis said that the news from Britain just isnt great and the government response required will affect the economy. More than 170,000 people have signed up to help Britains National Health Service tackle the outbreak.The pound was last down 0.6 at 1.1705, having slipped earlier to 1.1680. Against the euro, it also fell 0.6 to 92.28 pence. Were back to where sterling should be, Velis said.The British currency had enjoyed some welcome respite on Wednesday on the back of a broad-based weaker dollar and rallying stock markets, hitting a one-week high of 1.1971. The U.S. dollar had fallen across the board on some signs of stabler risk conditions amid the coronavirus crisis.A rally in global stocks also helped, analysts said, given Britains economy is so reliant on financial markets. Investors had also taken some comfort in thinking COVID-19s impact on Britains economy could be somewhat alleviated by financial stimulus from both the Bank of England and government.The British government on Monday opened the first part of a 330 billion pound 394 billion loan guarantee scheme for businesses, which will help small and medium-sized firms borrow up to 5 million pounds to deal with stoppages.

The official attendance for the Feb. 19 game was 45,792 — a "home" record for Atalanta, a small club making its debut in Europe's top club competition.
 Atalanta captain Alejandro "Papu" Gómez told Argentine daily Olé it was "terrible" to have played that game.
 "It's a city of 120,000 people and that day (40,000) went to the San Siro," the Argentine said. "It was a historic match for Atalanta, something unique. To give you an idea, my wife took three hours to get to Milan, when that trip normally takes 40 minutes."
 The game was played in Milan because Atalanta's stadium in Bergamo didn't meet the requirements set by European soccer governing body UEFA.
 Before the match, Valencia fans freely roamed around Milan and gathered at some of the city's plazas, including the Piazza del Duomo, drinking and chanting team songs.
 Looking back, the conditions for virus contagion were high, with thousands of people gathering without much concern — at a time when the outbreak in Europe wasn't yet known — and then traveling back home. Nearly 30 busloads of fans made the 60-kilometer (37-mile) trip from Bergamo to Milan.
 The evening before the match, there was no social distancing as officials from both clubs mingled and exchanged gifts and handshakes at a gala dinner offered by Atalanta.
 "I have heard a lot (of theories), I'll say mine: Feb. 19, 40,000 Bergamaschi went to San Siro for Atalanta-Valencia," Fabiano di Marco, the chief pneumologist at the hospital in Bergamo, told Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera. "In buses, cars, trains. A biological bomb, unfortunately."
 Valencia defender Ezequiel Garay was the first Spanish league player to test positive for COVID-19. The team played a Spanish league game against Alavés about two weeks after the game in Milan, and later Alavés reported that 15 people in the club were infected, though it did not say the cases were directly related to the match against Valencia.
 Italian soccer players' association president Damiano Tommasi believes sports authorities should look long and hard at the Atalanta match before restarting leagues.

We are calling on local officials throughout eastern North Carolina and the state to take more decisive action in response to this crisis to include making the bold and right decision to ask North Carolinians to shelter in place.
 This means staying close to home as much as possible and only going out if absolutely necessary, such as buying groceries or picking up medications. This is the right thing to do to save lives and is the right thing for our long- term economic interests. Community members must encourage the political bodies to be decisive, take action now and then support them.
 We would also like to thank all health care workers and every person on the front lines for their tireless efforts to care for those in need. This is a difficult time for doctors, nurses and care teams.
 We stand ready to care for those in our region, but we need local communities to do their part.
 We are confident we can flatten the curve. However, we must all stand up together, as one community, to get through this crisis.

Coronavirus has paralyzed much of the global economy. Nonessential businesses have closed in many places while restaurants, bars, and cafes have generally moved to a takeout/pickup only model in the United States. Pleasure travel has, of course, largely been eliminated as theme parks, cruise lines, casinos, and even many hotels have shut their doors until the pandemic passes.

Pardon my crude oxymoron. It is deliberate. It is the way I chose to title this article in light of the National Circles Council (NCC)'s "letter of displeasure" on the continuous verbal attacks unleashed on Asante Kotoko Management members by _Light FM 's_ sports crew. The letter, dated March 24, 2020, and signed by the NCC Chairman, Christopher Demeya, chronicles the maligning of Management members appointed by Kotoko Chairman, Kwame Kyei, by his own media house.
 "The NCC is not averse [to] dissenting views but not when it smacks of sheer malice and a cancerous desire to undermine the work and authority of the Management members of our great club," says the second paragraph of its letter. In the third, fourth and fifth paragraphs, the supporters' umbrella body states its confusion as to why the Chairman's FM station would be used as a "conduit to pursue parochial interest targeted at denting the reputation of his own men at work.
 The letter ends by admonishing managers of _Light FM_ to call their sports crew to order. I have had my own differences with Kotoko's leadership but it does not include an endorsement of conscious, unguarded commentaries meant to denigrate anybody. It is intriguing that, this character assassination takes place on the Chairman's own media channel. Why _Light FM_ , as espoused in the NCC letter, will abandon the good course of shedding light on the positives of the Chairman's work but inexcusably slam the Management team he chairs should confound any right-thinking Kotoko fan.
 The confusion becomes grand when you consider the fact that, recently, after the infamous Aduana Stars-Asante Kotoko league match; the Chairman called into _Asempa FM_ , whose crew, in an editorial, were asking legitimate questions of the Kotoko leadership. Our Chairman urged calm. He advised _Asempa FM_ to focus on productive developments at club like the fencing of the Adako Jachie land.
 With all due respect to him, has our Chairman not heard the insults on his Management members by _Light FM_ 's sports crew? Again, with the greatest of respect to him, has no one informed him about it? Has it not been brought to his attention that, the sports crew at his FM station have carelessly been castigating his Management with mortal damage being done eventually not to the Management but to the reputation of the club he leads?
 I say with sadness that, _Light FM 's_ sports crew is leading us into pitch darkness. It is disappointing. With the unfettered access they have to Kotoko by virtue of their owner being the club Chairman, one would have assumed that, they would better utilise the opportunities at their disposal - not misuse it by irresponsibly deriding the Management their own man appointed to help him administer the club.

Amid problems faced by stock brokers and other staff related to market entities in reaching their offices due to a nationwide lockdown, markets regulator Sebi on Wednesday asked all the states and union territories to allow such personnel to commute to their workplaces for smooth functioning of the capital markets. The development comes amid a 21-day nationwide lockdown announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday as part of efforts to curb the spread of coronavirus.However, the home ministry said capital and debt market entities notified by Sebi will be exempted from such closure. Stock brokers association Anmi and the Commodity Participants Association of India CPAI said brokers are facing problem while commuting to their respective offices due to lockdown as police are not allowing any movement.Consequently, the Securities and Exchange Board of India Sebi has written to all the states and union territories to allow movement of personnel of the entities notified by the regulator for the smooth functioning of the capital markets. Besides, the regulator has asked to facilitate the functioning and movement of its employees, according to the letter.Today, Sebi has written to chief secretaries administrators of all states UTs, requesting them to facilitate the functioning and movement of personnel of entities notified by Sebi for the smooth operation of the capital markets, a Sebi spokesperson told PTI. In the letter, Sebi has referred to an order issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs, which said The order...provides that commercial and private establishment shall be closed down but that the capital and debt market service as notified by the Securities and Exchange Board of India shall be exempted from such closures. This empowered Sebi to notify capital and debt market services from the applicability of this order and guidelines with respect to functioning of commercial and private establishments, the letter noted.Accordingly, the regulator-notified entities exempted from the nationwide closure are stock exchanges, clearing corporations, depositories, custodians, mutual funds, asset management companies, stock brokers, trading members, clearing members, depositories participants, registrar and share transfer agents. Besides, credit rating agencies, debenture trustees, foreign portfolio investors, portfolio managers, alternative investment funds and investment advisers have also been exempted.Several employees of market- related entities have been facing problems in commuting even as stock exchanges and brokers have been classified as essential services by the central and state governments. While almost all of our team is working remotely from home, there are very few critical jobs that may still need the physical infrastructure keeping customers interest in mind. Few of our employees faced challenge today Wednesday in reaching office but we are sure authorities will take necessary steps for smooth functioning of operations and very few selective critical people are given access to reach their offices, said Lav Chaturvedi, executive director and chief executive officer, Reliance Securities.Stock broker Abhinav Agarwal, who is a director of Abhipra Capital, said the biggest difficulty is that the bare minimum staff is not able to reach the office, trading may be done online but back-office work requires people. They are afraid because of police behaviour. Families are also pressurising not to come out. Meeting with regular compliances for day-to-day trading is becoming impossible without the staff. Another broker Deepak, who is a director at Jyoti Portfolio, said that by facing a lot of difficulties, only four staff members could reach office and now, those people are refusing to come on Thursday. Meanwhile, investment services company Geojit Financial Services said it will continue to offer its services to meet the investment needs of its clients with a limited number of staff.Meanwhile, Anmi, which has around 900 brokers as members, has appealed to Sebi to allow a systematic closure till the nationwide lockdown remains in force. On Tuesday, the Association of National Exchanges Members of India Anmi requested Sebi to close stock exchanges for at least two days, which will give brokerage firms time to close their entire outstanding positions, in case all states do not declare stock broking as an essential service.Besides, CPAI also requested Sebi to close down all exchanges operations with appropriate directions till March 31, initially if the request of classifying broking as essential service cannot be considered as feasible and take a fresh review of situation later. These requests came after broking firms and other staff of market entities were facing problem in reaching their offices because of lockdown announced by several state governments PTI SP RAM HRS

Dear Dave,   In light of recent events in our country, do you have suggestions for things people should think about and plan for if they get laid off from their jobs?   Sam
 Dear Sam,   It's no secret that things are shutting down all across the world. If your workplace has closed its doors and isn't offering pay, then it's time to regroup and get some things in order. The thought of being without a paycheck can be overwhelming, but a little thought and planning can help you get through times like these.
 Start living on a budget, if you aren't doing so already. Making a monthly budget will show you exactly where your money is going. Without it, you can't use every dollar to its fullest potential, because you don't even know how much money you have to work with. Plus, your budget will show places where you can cut back and save money.
 If you don't have any income right now, make a budget based on the amount of money on hand. If you have $600 left to your name, budget out exactly where each of those dollars will go. It's time to squeeze every last penny out of what you've got. If you still have cash coming in from a spouse's job or some other source, then adjust your budget to reflect that. Maybe the two of you usually bring in a combined $5,000 a month. Adjust your budget to live off that one income for the time being.
 When the going gets tough, you need to focus on the things you really need to survive - food, utilities, shelter and transportation. I call these the Four Walls. If there's any money left over after you take care of the Four Walls, make a list of what else you need to pay, and tackle those in order of importance. Reach out to anyone you can't pay, and explain the situation. They might be able to work something out, but they can't help if they don't know. Be upfront with them, and pray for the best.
 When you're just trying to make it to another day, you don't need to pay extra on debt. Instead, focus on piling up cash. Once life gets back to normal and everything is okay, you can pick up where you left off with your debt snowball. If it's within your budget to keep making minimum payments on your debt, go for it. But the Four Walls come first. This is also the time to sell anything and everything you don't need to make some extra cash.
 With so much being shut down right now, there might not be as many traditional ways to make extra money. So, look into driving for Amazon, delivering takeout food or dropping off grocery orders. Even if one of those doesn't work out, you can still take up odd jobs around your neighborhood. Be on the lookout for opportunities that will add a few extra bucks to your pocket. Don't forget to cut back on unnecessary expenses, either. Stop or pause your subscriptions. Call your cable, internet and cellular providers to see if there's anything they'll do to work with you.
 Finally, in times of real need, don't be too proud to ask for a helping hand. Many churches and community groups in your area exist for situations just like this.
 God bless you all!   Dave

Canada's C$27 billion ($18.8 billion) aid package will give people affected by the coronavirus outbreak C$2,000 a month and delay student loan repayments, among other measures to boost the economy, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Wednesday. After almost a day of wrangling, the House of Commons agreed early on Wednesday to approve the stimulus. The Canada Emergency Response Benefit bill was being debated in the Senate.
 "We are hopeful that the system will be up and running by April 6 and the checks and direct deposits will be flowing days after that," Trudeau told reporters outside his house. A few dozen legislators - maintaining social distancing in the face of the highly contagious disease - backed the measures after the Liberal government agreed to remove proposals that would have given Ottawa emergency spending powers without Parliamentary approval until the end of 2021.
 The bill - which also includes C$55 billion in the form of tax deferrals - must now be approved by the unelected Senate, which will meet later on Wednesday. Government officials say they anticipate senators will quickly approve the measures.
 A total of 2,792 Canadians have been diagnosed with the coronavirus and 27 have died, while more than a million people have applied for unemployment benefits in less than two weeks. Trudeau, who unveiled the stimulus package last week, said on Tuesday the crisis meant the government needed flexibility to react quickly.
 But after almost 18 hours of wrangling, and faced with opposition threats to drag out approval of the aid, Trudeau officials agreed to dilute some of their demands. "Because we fought back, the Trudeau government has backed down from its power grab," said Pierre Poilievre, finance spokesman for the official opposition Conservatives.
 The modified bill caps Ottawa's emergency spending power at six months. It also says the House of Commons finance committee - which is controlled by opposition legislators - can probe government spending and force Parliament back in 48 hours if it thinks abuses are occurring. Trudeau's Liberals only have a minority in the House of Commons and rely on other parties to govern.
 Once senators have voted for the bill, it needs formal assent from the Governor-General, the representative of Queen Elizabeth, Canada's head of state. This is a formality.

Should the league eventually resume play behind closed doors, that would continue to leave clubs without gate revenue even while TV payments start up again.

The new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms for most people, but for some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness or death.

Due to the stock market destabilization during the COVID-19 pandemic, Edenton is among several municipalities that are having problems receiving bids on upcoming projects.
 During the meeting March 10, Town Manager Anne-Marie Knighton spoke to council about how plans to hold a public hearing regarding a purchase contract for street maintenance were postponed as no one bid on the project.
 A few days before the bidding was to close on the project, with an estimated cost of about $900,000, Town Finance Officer Virginia Smith told Knighton that Town Hall hadn’t received any proposals from prospective contractors.
 “It was unusual, because normally we get two to three proposals right before the deadline,” she said.
 Knighton contacted the state’s Local Government Commission (LGC) about seeking financing for the proposal from banks, an approach that has helped Edenton with other projects.
 LGC noted that because of the volatile stock market, the low interest rate and low Treasury bond rate, many companies are taking a wait and see approach when it comes to taking on new projects.
 Council unanimously voted to table the proposal. Knighton hopes to put the road-work project back out to bid so council can hold a public hearing on April 14.
 “Hopefully within the next couple weeks, the financial markets will settle down and we can take proposals,” she said.
 During the committee portion of the meeting, council approved a budget amendment that would divert extra sales-tax revenue toward work on the former Chowan Arts Council’s space when it was located within the building by the waterfront where council meets.
 According to Knighton, tax collections have been higher than forecast, so $3,725 has been moved to fund expenses for maintenance, repairs and renovations at the space, which will be used for meeting space.
 In other matters, Town Hall is expecting about $97,000 in reimbursements from FEMA for its work in connection to Hurricane Dorian. Of those funds, $57,049 will be from debris removal.
 During the public comments portion, an Edenton resident asked about ongoing legal case with Vincent Burgher III, who owns Pembroke Hall.
 Earlier in the meeting, Knighton said Chowan County Superior Court remanded the case, which involves a dispute with the Historical Commission, back to the Board of Adjustments. Due to representing the Board of Adjustments in court, Town Attorney Hood Ellis said he can not represent the Historical Commission at the hearing – a conflict of interest.
 Town Hall is in the process of securing Lauren Arizaga-Womble of Twiford Law Firm as its representative in legal proceedings associated with the case. Knighton said Arizaga-Womble will bill the town for perhaps five to six hours for her time working on the case.
 During the public comment portion of the meeting, a Mill Village resident asked how much Town Hall expected to pay in legal fees and whether it would be worth it.
 During a previous council meeting, Knighton said the town expected to pay about $15,000 in legal fees.
 “We expect Ms. Womble’s fee to be $4,000 to $5,000 at max,” she said. “If the board finds in favor of the preservation board, the applicant has the right to go back to court and appeal the ruling.”
 Knighton explained why this legal fight is worth pursuing.

Even before I looked in the mirror, I knew my face was puffy. It might have had something to do with the fact that I could feel my cheeks touching my eyebrows or maybe that my lips felt like they were the size of eggplants. I knew some women paid good money for lips that looked like mine, but at that moment, I suspected it was probably not a good look for me.      When I finally did take a peak in the mirror, I realized it wasn't just regular old, "I probably slept on my face" puffy. It was more like, "I look like the Pillsbury Doughboy" puffy. It was clear, something dramatic had happened while I slept. It was like the Tooth Fairy had taken out a hit on me.      "What happened to your face?" said my husband when I emerged from the bathroom.      "What do you mean?" I said, feigning ignorance.      "You're all, um, puffy."      "Oh?" I said. "I hadn't noticed."      "Really?" he said.      "OF COURSE NOT," I boomed. "How could I not notice that I woke up looking like a popover?"      He backed up slowly out of the bedroom, realizing this was one land mine he did not want to step on.      "Call the doctor," he shouted from the other room.      I should mention that this wasn't the first time I've had a puffy face. I experienced something similar years ago when I had my kids. When most women get pregnant, their feet swell. For me, it was my face. Of course, this may have had more to do with all the donuts I ate while I was pregnant than the pregnancy itself, but for arguments sake we'll just say it was pregnancy.      However, I was not pregnant now, and unless, by some miracle of middle age magic, wouldn't ever be again, so it clearly wasn't a hormonal thing. I also didn't recall eating anything the day before that I might have had a reaction to, such as blowfish poison, which could leave you looking like an actual blowfish, assuming you didn't die first.      Realizing I couldn't figure this out myself, I scheduled a televisit with my doctor.      "Your face is very puffy," my doctor said to me when she came on screen.      "See, that's why I chose you as my doctor," I said. "Because of your keen observational skills and masterful assessments."      "It's my superpower," she said. "So, what did you eat last night?"      "Nothing out of the ordinary."      "New cosmetics?" she said.      "Nope."      "Well, I'd say it definitely looks like an allergic reaction." She stared at my face in silence for a few moments.      "What did you wear yesterday?" she said.      "Um, a new wool sweater. A Turtleneck."   "Is your neck itchy?"      "Yes, actually, it is." I said. I had been so busy fretting about my puffy face that I hadn't noticed my itchy neck.      "You had an allergic reaction to the wool," she concluded.      "Wow. Okay," I said, recalling how uncomfortable I'd been at the end of the day. "So, that's something new. Are you sure?"      "Did you snore last night?" she asked.      "Actually, I did."      "Well, that's that," she said. "You either had a reaction to the sweater or your husband tried to smother you with a pillow."

“I think it is too early to begin talking about cancelling big events such as graduation and discussing how this will impact our seniors,” she said. “There are so many unknowns that we cannot even begin to talk about or discuss without further guidance from the state. I will continue to remain hopeful we will be able to return to school on May 18 and provide our seniors the graduation ceremony they deserve.”
 Pirates’ senior Carlton Baker wants to wear his graduation gown and turn the tassel on his mortar board.
 “I really hope we have a commencement,” he said. “I have waited 13 years for this moment and I know my family has, so I hope that there are plans in place that if we can’t graduate in June that we do get to have a ceremony. Graduating from high school is a special moment in everyone’s life and we deserve to have a ceremony to celebrate all our accomplishments through the years of school.”
 Pirates’ junior Natalie Corprew hates the time lost for seniors, who are worried about graduation.
 “These are events so special to them that got taken away just like that,” she said. “Graduation is up in the air. Being a junior marshal was a special privilege for myself and some of my classmates, too. My heart hurts for the seniors if we won’t be able to have these milestones.”
 A top student, Corprew is supposed to attend Governor’s School in the summer but she admits that it’s not looking too promising. Still, it takes more than the coronavirus to dim Corprew’s spirits.
 “Despite all of the negatives that seem to be dragging people down, I’m trying to focus on the positives such enjoying family time and operating at a slower pace,” she said.
 A top Pirates’ athlete with plans to attend Wesleyan College in the fall, Sai Veon Skinner said he’s disappointed that schools are closing for such a long period of time.
 “Not being able to see the majority of my friends is a bit heartbreaking because I find most of my happiness through my friends, teachers, and classmates,” he said. “It’s also difficult for me and my senior classmates to give up our spring season of sports, which many have been looking forward to. I know transitioning to online school will be different for a lot of students and sometimes difficult to keep up with. I’m certainly upset that school is closing until May but it is definitely the right decision under the circumstances.”
