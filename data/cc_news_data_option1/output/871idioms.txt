Following the Agriculture Improvement act of 2018, hemp with less than 0.3% THC was descheduled as a controlled substance in the US. This led to an explosion in popularity of CBD and availability of commercial products containing this phyotcannabinoid. CBD is a prominent phytocannabinoid (a molecule produced by a plant) in the Cannabis sativa plant. It has been advocated for use in a wide range of diseases from anxiety to heart health and even cancer, and has gained in popularity among pet owners as well.

BRIDGEWATER -- Bridgewater-Raynham High junior swimmer Megan Kramer has made first-year coach Haley Nolan's job much easier.


  Kramer, already one of the state's top swimmers, doesn't need much attention from her coach.


  "I am very grateful to have her," said Nolan. "Because she can do anything that she is asked and when she is asked and never questions it.


  "(Before meets), I'll kind of just look at her like, 'You know what you need to do, just put your head down and go.' … She's this elite level of a swimmer, she knows what she needs to do behind the block, on the block, and in the race so I have complete trust in her."


  Since her first meet freshman year, Kramer has put together quite a resume. She already has 11 school records.


  This season, Kramer did not lose a race as an individual, which includes bringing home south sectional and state titles in the 100 yard butterfly and 200 individual medley. Her talent helped the Trojans go 5-3 and place fifth overall at states and sixth at the south sectionals.


  Kramer also achieved an All-American consideration time in the 100 butterly, earning herself 'elite' status. She also teamed up with sophomores Kiley George, Lillian Martin and freshman Jessie McNeil to place fourth at sectionals and states in the 400 free relay.


  With few words exchanged between Kramer and Nolan, the two have put plenty of trust within one another. Nolan was a top swimmer at Lowell High and eventually competed at Bridgewater State, but now is in her first year coaching a high school team, which has 51 members.


  "She has that technique, she has that pure talent, she has that drive," said Nolan. "It's really exciting for the underclassmen and less experienced swimmers to have her as a role model. It really does bring a lot of drive and when she gets in the pool, it's just a great atmosphere around her and jaws drop."


  "It's definitely really cool, but I don't really think much of it," said Kramer of her achievements. "It's nice. It was kind of unexpected but everyone was supporting me no matter what."


  Kramer got her start in the pool when she was only 5 years old when her mom signed her up for lessons. At 3, she watched her older brother and sister, Nathan and Hannah, swim and immediately wanted to dive in with them. Kramer joined the Bluefish Swim Club "just for fun" as she puts it, but since her love for the sport has only grown.


  As her older siblings set the stage at B-R with their swimming talents, Megan followed suit in 2017. Megan had some help freshman year from her sister Hannah who was a senior at the time.


  The youngest Kramer was nervous about making the leap to high school competition. It didn't take her long to swim by her competition. She broke a league record in the 500 freestyle in her first meet. She followed that up with a first-place finish in the 100 breaststroke at states later that season.


  Her favorite races are the 100 butterfly, 100 breastroke, and the 200 individual medley and her favorite part of the year is the playoff season because she thinks it's fun, but doesn't let the pressure get to her.


  Kramer continues to practice at Bluefish, where she swims for roughly three hours every day six or seven days a week in addition to the high school practices which last about 90 minutes. While it might be a busy schedule for most people, Kramer stays dedicated to her craft and hopes to compete at the Division 1 level in college after she graduates next year. But for now, there's no telling just how many more records she'll break.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday began talks with lawmakers to form a strong national coalition government led by him after the exit polls projected majority for his right-wing Likud Party in the countrys unprecedented third parliamentary elections. According to the exit polls published shortly after the voting ended on Monday, 70-year-old Netanyahus Likud Party-led alliance will win 59 seats, just two short of the majority in the 120-member Parliament.Netanyahu had the support of 60 members in the Knesset after the April 9 polls, the first out of the three within a year, but he could not manage to win just one more member to form a government. Israelis voted on Monday for the third time in less than a year to break the deadlock on government formation, with the countrys longest-serving premier Netanyahu fighting for his political survival amid indictments on graft charges, which he denies.A beaming Netanyahu said he would meet with the other right-wing and religious parties later on Tuesday to discuss forming a strong, national government for the state of Israel. He is now seeking a record fifth term, having been in office from 1996 to 1999 and again from 2009. Likud spokesman Jonathan Urich said that work has begun to convince lawmakers from the center-left bloc to defect and join a Likud-led coalition headed by Netanyahu, Haaretz online reported.This is a night of great victory, Netanyahu said in a victory speech at his party headquarters hours after exit polls showed his Likud had an upper hand. We won against all odds. They eulogized us, but we prevailed. We made lemons into lemonade. We turned Israel into a superpower, we nurtured new connections with world leaders, including more leaders than you can even imagine in the Arab and Muslim world, he said.When I say that we will bring peace agreements with more Arab nations, its not mere words. There are things in the works. This is only the tip of the iceberg, he said, highlighting his claim to lead Israel as the only leader of global stature. Israels Central Election Committee said it has completed counting almost 97 per cent of the votes polled and the only votes remaining to be counted are the absentee ballots.The absentee ballots include those of the soldiers, prisoners, diplomats posted abroad and other emissaries which will be counted later Tuesday. Votes of those quarantined due to possible exposure to Coronavirus, cast at special polling stations, will be counted in a tent outside the Knesset on Wednesday morning.Counting of these votes is generally a tedious process as they go through cross-checks and their results will be available only on Sunday. As per law, the final results of the polls can be announced until March 9. The Likud Party has solidified its position as the single largest party with a decent lead of 36-32 over closest rival Blue and White party of former Israeli army Chief Benny Gantz. Gantz has refused to accept defeat when he appeared before his partys supporters at their Tel Aviv headquarters but admitted he shared their feeling of disappointment and pain. This is not the result we wanted and not the result that will put Israel back on the right track, he said. Netanyahu does not have 61 votes to form a government, he said. We will consider our path. We respect the word of the voters. We were, are and will remain obligated to the fate of the State of Israel. He also reminded the supporters of Netanyahus impending trial set to begin on March 17.Criminal proceedings can only be dealt with in the courtroom, and Netanyahu will stand trial for three severe offenses, he said. Gantz said he would not sit in a government with Netanyahu because of the charges of graft against him.Likud has bagged 29.35 per cent of the votes, equal to around 36 Knesset seats, which could represent the partys strongest showing as Israelis look to end a political deadlock that has left the country without a fully functioning government for over a year. The Blue and White party was trailing with 26.34 per cent votes, representing some 31 seats, which is its poorest showing in the last three attempts.Netanyahus right-wing allies too have fared well in the polls with ultra-Orthodox Shas party and United Torah Judaism at 10 and 7 seats respectively, while religious right- wing Yamina party got six seats. The current situation brings the right-wing blocs tally to 59 in the house of 120, just two seat shy of a simple majority.Israeli Arabs led Joint List was looking to win 15 seats, while the Labor-Gesher-Meretz alliance on the Left stood at seven seats as per the latest round of counting. Former defence minister Avigdor Liebermans Yisrael Beitenu party is likely to win 7 seats, one down from last time.The elections were largely seen as a referendum on Netanyahu who will go on trial later this month for bribery, fraud and breach of trust, but is thought to be seeking support for a legislative mechanism to grant him immunity. Throughout the campaign, Ive spoken about everything we intend to achieve in the coming years applying sovereignty over our homeland in the Jordan valley, Netanyahu said, referring to his controversial campaign promise to annex the territory.

A tusker, Thechikottukavu Ramachandran, who killed 13 people and three elephants, was allowed to be paraded at temple festivals again. The ban was lifted by the Thrissur administration on Monday after a review meeting by the Thrissur District Monitoring Committee based petition by the Thechikottukavu Temple Devaswom.
 The 55-year-old tusker, which is almost entirely blind, will now be paraded twice a week across temples in the state. Weekly fitness tests are also to be conducted on the 55-year-old tusker. Further, an elephant squad with members from both the festival squad and the district monitoring committee is to remain close to the animal during temple festivals. The committee has also stated that whenever he is taken to a temple, the forest officials and police in the area are to be intimated in advance.
 The ban, however, has not been lifted for the Thrissur Pooram, where it is usually paraded in front of the Vadakkumnathan temple on the first day of the festival. The elephant symbolically opens the temple main door, marking the beginning of the festival. It has been banned from being paraded during festivals by the Kerala High Court seven times. Its last ban was issued on March 25, 2019, after it trampled to death two persons and injured seven others during a house warming ceremony in Guruvayoor in February last year.
 It should not be paraded for more than one hour says Venkitachalam, Secretary of Heritage animal task force secretary to ANI. ''Security surveillance systems, including CCTV, should be prepared for its parade,'' he said. (ANI)

The worst is still to come for the airline industry in terms of economic damage from the coronavirus outbreak, European bosses warned on Tuesday, but they predicted that travel demand could stabilise in the coming weeks. Coronavirus has hit demand, forcing airlines to cancel flights and cut costs, and ask governments and regulators for help as they battle to get to grips with what they hope will be short-term, rather than long-term, disruption.
 The heads of Europe's biggest carriers discussed the impact of the epidemic at an annual industry conference. They included Ryanair chief Michael O'Leary; Willie Walsh, boss of British Airways-owner IAG; and easyJet's Johan Lundgren. "We have seen a drop in demand when you look particularly in the northern part of Italy, but that has also spilled over to the other parts of the network," easyJet CEO Johan Lundgren said.
 Italy has suffered the biggest outbreak of the illness in Europe. IAG's Walsh also noted a "very significant fall-off in demand" in Italian markets in the past week. But he predicted demand would stabilise in coming weeks if bookings followed the pattern seen in Asia.
 "I think we will see air traffic recover in due course," he said. Ryanair's O'Leary agreed the next few weeks would be tough. He said he expected a "very deflated booking environment" for the next two to three weeks, but should the crisis stabilise, bookings would recover.
 "I think you will see a pretty rapid return to normal," he said. Yet the bosses acknowledged it could get a lot worse before it gets better.
 "If we're not successful in the containment of it then there might be a more difficult outcome," Lundgren said. O'Leary told Reuters in an interview that he would introduce cheaper tickets to stimulate the market closer to the summer, if necessary.
 On future demand for the aircraft themselves, two sales executives from planemakers Airbus and Boeing said that it was too early to gauge the impact. Both O'Leary and Walsh said there would always be demand for more aircraft if they were cheap enough. 'TAKE BURDENS AWAY'
 Airlines worldwide have been suspending flights or modifying services in response to the coronavirus outbreak, which has now claimed more than 3,000 lives and infected more than 90,000 people globally, after spreading from China to 77 other countries and territories. The crisis has led to a quarter of the short-haul fleet of airlines like Lufthansa being grounded.
 As part of the European airline lobby group A4E, the airlines called for a relaxation of airport regulations which cover slot usage, to help them cope with the impact of coronavirus. That was in line with a call from global industry body IATA on Monday for a suspension of rules under which airlines can lose lucrative landing and take-off slots if they cancel flights for a prolonged period.
 The airlines want a temporary waiver to be granted by all EU member states on slots, something O'Leary called "critical", and a common set of health requirements for travel to and from the affected regions. "Before we need help, there's a lot of burdens you can take away - we never ask for help, we ask for less burdens," Lufthansa CEO Carsten Spohr told the conference.
 IAG's Walsh said struggling airlines should not be given state aid to enable them to survive the drop in demand. But there was a feeling governments could take other actions to help all airlines navigate this difficult period. "I do think it is absolutely the right thing to do to ask governments to consider what type of support they can give their airlines in terms of maintaining connectivity," Lundgren said.
 Air France-KLM CEO Ben Smith said that what set this crisis apart from the SARS crisis in 2003 was the role played by social media. "What's definitely different with this crisis (is) the type of media attention it's getting. Social media has had a different impact on the trust and the understanding of people who fly," he said.
 Ryanair's O'Leary said social media wasn't helping but he was confident its impact was short-lived. "There's a lot of misinformation out there. Social media is a scourge for idiots but common sense usually wins out in a reasonably short period of time," he said.

OPEC's proposal to cut oil production by up to 1 million barrels a day would be enough to balance the oil market and lift prices to $60 a barrel, Leonid Fedun, vice-president of Russian oil producer Lukoil, told Reuters.
 The comments from Fedun, who was talking on the sidelines of the company's presentation of its low-carbon energy strategy, suggest Russia may be willing to agree to OPEC's proposals for more output cuts in light of the coronavirus outbreak.
 The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its partners, a group known as OPEC+, will meet in Vienna on March 5-6 to discuss additional steps to support the oil market as the spread of the coronavirus risks hurting demand.
 OPEC initially called for a cut of 600,000 barrels per day (bpd) to prop up prices, in addition to existing cuts of 1.7 million bpd which are expected to be extended when [they] expire at the end of this month.
 It has since proposed deeper cuts of 1 million bpd though Russia has yet to agree to any new cuts. "Conoravirus ... is a short-lived factor which is affecting oil prices ... There will be an OPEC (and non-OPEC) meeting, compensatory measures will be taken which will take the excess oil off the market and the oil price will rebound," Fedun said.
 "In my view, (a joint) cut of between 600,000 bpd to 1 million bpd is enough to balance the market hit by 'black swans' such as coronavirus. This is enough for oil to rebound to $60 per barrel," he told Reuters.
 Russia is the world's second-biggest oil exporter after Saudi Arabia. Lukoil is also Russia's second-biggest oil producer, pumping nearly 1.8 million bpd, which is on a par with OPEC member Nigeria.
 Most of its oil comes from Russia but it also has operations in a number of ex-Soviet countries, as well as in Iraq, Africa and some other places. Brent crude futures have slumped from January's peak of $71.75 to a low for 2020 of $48.40 on Monday on concerns the virus outbreak will hit global demand for oil.
 MIDDLE EAST TIES
 Partnership with OPEC is essential for Russia's budget and for its ties with Middle East leaders because Moscow plays an important role in a number of conflicts in the region. Russian President Vladimir Putin met oil companies, including Lukoil, on Sunday. He indicated that he favored joint action with OPEC but stressed that the current oil price level was acceptable to Moscow, signaling that Russia's contribution to further output cuts may be limited.
 Fedun, who is also Lukoil's second-biggest shareholder, told reporters on Monday that he expected Russia to cut its oil output by about 200,000-300,000 bpd. "We are ready to cut (our oil production) as much as we are told to. Better to sell less oil but at a higher price," Fedun said.
 He also said on Monday that OPEC+ could cut output by even more than 1 million bpd but his comments to Reuters suggest he believes the existing proposals should suffice.
 While playing down any long-term risks to global markets from the coronavirus outbreak, Fedun said it was a carbon emissions reduction agenda that was set to drastically change the global oil industry, including Lukoil. Major western oil firms have all set carbon reduction goals of varying degrees, including reaching a net zero-carbon level by 2050.
 "Lukoil is starting to develop its own climate strategy - we will be aiming to reach carbon neutrality by 2050 along with the rest of Europe," Fedun said, adding that his firm was looking to expand further into solar and wind energy along with hydropower. Fedun also reiterated that Lukoil aims to allocate all free cash flow to dividends, while also taking spending on share buyback programs into consideration.

Technical chart claims that Tilray, Inc. (TLRY) would settle between $16.13/share to $16.91/share level. However, if the stock price goes below the $14.06 mark, then the market for Tilray, Inc. becomes much weaker. If that happens, the stock price might even plunge as low as $12.77 for its downside target. The stock is currently in the red zone of MACD, with the indicator reading -1.67. Traders are always alerted for the move of a stock above or below the zero line due to the fact that the reading is an indicator of the position of the short-term average relative to the long-term average. If the MACD is above the zero line, then the short-term average relative is above that of the long-term average, thus implying an upward momentum. Vice versa is the case if the MACD is below the zero line.

KASTANIES/LESBOS -- European Union officials on Tuesday promised more cash for Greece during a visit to its border with Turkey which tens of thousands of migrants and refugees have been trying for days to breach.
 The officials urged Turkey to abide by a 2016 deal which requires it to keep the migrants on its soil in return for EU aid. After an upsurge in fighting in Syria last week, Ankara says it will no longer stop migrants who want to reach Europe.
 Greek riot police have used tear gas against the migrants at its Kastanies border post, while the coastguard has tried to stop boats transporting migrants to Greece's Aegean islands. A Syrian boy died on Monday after his boat capsized in the area.
 "The situation at our border is not only an issue for Greece to manage, it is the responsibility of Europe as a whole," the head of the EU's executive Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, told a news conference at Kastanies.
 "We will hold the line and our unity will prevail," she said after touring the area with Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis and the heads of the European Council and Parliament.
 Von der Leyen announced additional aid of 700 million euros to help Greece deal with the migrant crisis.
 Brussels is desperate to avoid a repeat of the 2015-16 crisis, when more than a million migrants entered the EU from Turkey via the Balkans, straining European security and welfare systems and boosting support for far-right parties.
 Greek troops and riot police remained on high alert along the Turkish border on Tuesday, though there were no reports of significant new clashes with the migrants.
 "There were only a few attempts today (to cross the border). Let's hope they get the message," a machine gun-toting army officer told Reuters at the Kastanies border post.
 Army jeeps patrolled the area and roads leading to the Evros river which marks the Greek-Turkish border remained shut.
 GREECE, TURKEY AT LOGGERHEADS
 The crisis has badly strained ties, never good, between Ankara and Athens.
 Mitsotakis accused Ankara of deliberately encouraging migrants to head to the border in order to "promote its geopolitical agenda and divert attention from the situation in Syria."
 He also said these migrants were not fleeing the latest flareup of fighting in Syria's Idlib province but were people "who have been living safely in Turkey for a long period of time." Many speak fluent Turkish, he added.
 French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian also accused Turkey on Tuesday of using the refugees to "blackmail" Europe.
 Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan infuriated Mitsotakis on Monday by accusing Greek border guards of killing two migrants and wounding a third, a claim denied by Athens.
 On Tuesday, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said Greek forces were shooting migrants "in the back as they are running away," but he provided no evidence.
 Turkey, which hosts 3.6 million refugees from Syria's civil war and faces another possible big influx as the fighting drags on there, says it cannot take in any more.
 Human Rights Watch said it had received multiple reports that Greek border guards were pushing people back into Turkey, which could violate the right to claim asylum as well as a ban on returning people to where they would be unsafe, both of which are enshrined in international law.
 The mood towards migrants on Greek islands such as Lesbos - once relatively welcoming - has soured since the 2015-16 crisis amid a sense that the Athens government and the EU are not providing sufficient support.
 "It used to be the island of solidarity but it seems like the locals are exhausted," said Charlie Meyers, a U.S. aid worker on Lesbos.

Israel's largely Arab Joint List alliance was on track for its best-ever electoral performance, near-complete results showed Tuesday, consolidating its place as the third largest parliamentary bloc.
 With 90 percent of votes counted, the Joint List was slated to take 15 of 120 seats in the Knesset -- Israel's parliament -- up from 13 following elections in September.
 But it may yet fall short of its chief goal of blocking Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's re-election, with his right-wing Likud and its allies expected to control 59 seats -- just two short of a majority.
 The Joint List's solid performance came after it campaigned heavily for the votes of Jewish leftists disenchanted by the demise of Israel's historic left- wing parties, notably Labour.
 The success of that strategy remains unclear, pending a breakdown of voter patterns.
 But Joint List chairman, Ayman Odeh, made no secret of his wish to become the face of the Israeli left -- for both Arabs and Jews.
 \- Leftists 'don't despair' -
 "I want to congratulate our public, both the Arab and the many Jewish voters who supported the Joint List," Odeh told reporters Tuesday morning.
 "This is the beginning of strengthening the true left," he said.
 "I call on leftists to not despair or do any soul-searching, but to think about a partnership... real democracy, real equality between Jews and Arabs in the country and social justice for the weak."
 To get out its core Arab vote, the Joint List also focused on US President Donald Trump's controversial peace plan, detested and feared by Arabs, who make up around 20 percent of Israel's population.
 They are particularly alarmed by a clause that would place some Israeli Arab towns and villages under the sovereignty of a future Palestinian state.
 If implemented, that could see some Arab Israelis have their citizenship changed against their will.
 Monday's election was the third in less than a year, after inconclusive votes in April and September.
 The Centrist Blue and White alliance, Likud's main challenger, slid to 32 seats from 33 in September, while an alliance of the Labour party, left-wing Meretz and centrist Gesher spiralled from 11 seats running separately in the last election to seven together.
 The Joint List's member parties include conservative Islamists and Arab nationalists.
 They are united by demanding the end of Israel's occupation of Palestinian territories and the establishment of a Palestinian state, a position regarded as left-wing in Jewish Israeli society.
 Its manifesto also includes "workers’ rights and social and environmental justice".
 In September, the list backed Gantz to form a government, but for political reasons he was loath to form a coalition with what is an anti-Zionist group.
 The list's parliamentary numbers, however, blocked Netanyahu and his right- wing allies from attaining power.

 The board has other requirements for students. To be a member, students must have a GPA of 2.0 or more, be available both semesters, pay their own student activity fee and be in good standing at the school.
 Laughead said students who want to participate should also expect to attend meetings once per month. The board meets in the Knowlton Board Room in the Hadley Union Building at 3:30 p.m. some Thursdays.
 The meetings not only discuss what to do with money, but they give students new qualities that help them in the workplace.
 “Students who serve on the board should expect to get a better understanding of financing, managing and operating a student union building like the HUB,” Laughead said.
 Petitions are due Wednesday before 4 p.m. They are to be delivered to Zach Clark in the business office at the HUB. They can be sent in either via email or in person. If sending them in electronically, students are to scan the original petition. This can be done in the library.
 Voting for the board takes place between March 9 and 18. It will be sent out to every student’s email, and results will be announced about an hour after voting ends.
 For more information, students can call 724-357-1393.

The International Olympic Committee IOC on Tuesday gave further strong backing to this summers Tokyo Olympics and urged athletes to prepare full steam despite the coronavirus threat. We are preparing for a successful Olympic Games Tokyo 2020, IOC head Thomas Bach said at an executive board meeting to discuss the situation.The 66-year-old German lawyer and former Olympic fencing champion has a firm grip on IOC decision-making and is known for sticking to his guns in adversity. Both Tokyo 2020 Olympics organisers and the IOC have repeatedly stressed that the July 24-Aug. 9 Games will go ahead as planned despite the outbreak, and that there is no plan B.I would like to encourage all the athletes to continue their preparation for the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020 with great confidence and full steam, Bach later told reporters. From our side, we will continue to support the athletes and the National Olympic Committees.However, multiple sports events around the world have been cancelled during the epidemic, which has killed more than 3,000 people in China and spread to more than 60 nations including Japan where infections are near 1,000 and 12 people have died.

The events of the last decade provide a still-unfinished afterword of sorts to _Japan at the Crossroads_. Beginning with the Obama administration’s “pivot to Asia,” a consensus has emerged in US foreign policy circles that China represents the gravest threat to American interests in this century. Our growing anxieties about East Asia have coincided with the return of the brazenly nationalist LDP leader Shinzo Abe, who won a second term as prime minister in 2012 and has led his party as far right as it has been since Kishi held the reins in the late 1950s. Abe’s primary goal is remilitarization, to be achieved through revising the constitutional constraints on Japan’s military spending and use of force. The result is that, once again, the military aspect of the Anpo treaty has emerged as the focal point of US- Japanese relations.28

ANKARA/MOSCOW -- Escalating military action by Russia and Turkey in Idlib risks a direct confrontation between the two major foreign powers in Syria's war, days ahead of a summit of their leaders to hammer out a deal to halt the fighting.
 Both countries say they hope to avoid a head-on clash, but after Turkey ramped up attacks on Russian-backed Syrian forces and Russian military police helped secure a town seized from Turkey-backed rebels, all sides acknowledge the risk.
 Turkey says it has shot down three Syrian planes and destroyed eight helicopters and scores of tanks since last Thursday, when 34 Turkish soldiers were killed in an air strike, the deadliest attack on the Turkish army in nearly 30 years.
 In response to the Turkish assault and advances by Turkey-backed rebels, Moscow said on Monday that Russian military police were helping fortify the strategic town of Saraqeb, which has changed hands three times in a month, to ensure it didn't fall into rebel hands.
 "We need to accept that this incident raised tensions between the two countries," a Turkish security official said of last week's attack on Turkish troops.
 "Turkey does not intend to clash with Russia in any way, and Russia does not want that either," he said. "But on the battlefield it's another story. It's so complicated that an accidental attack on one another is the biggest risk."
 NATO member Turkey has the alliance's second largest army. Russia, a nuclear- armed power, has a major air base in Syria and deployed warships in the Mediterranean last week.
 Turkey already hosts 3.6 million Syrian refugees and is trying to stem advances by Russian-backed Syrian government forces which have displaced 1 million people in Idlib, the last rebel bastion in Syria, driving them towards the Turkish border.
 Russian support since 2015 has been instrumental in turning the tide of the war in favor of President Bashar al-Assad, who says he will recapture "every inch" of Syrian land.
 "Russia is taking a very tough stance and showing it's ready for conflict," said former Russian lawmaker Sergey Markov. "An attack on Saraqeb will be an attack on Russia."
 A person with direct knowledge of the Russian military police deployment in Syria said they had entered Saraqeb to show the Turks that they risked a direct clash with Moscow if they tried to retake it.
 Russia believed the risk of a clash between Turkish and Russian forces was real, the same source said, saying Russian military police had been ordered not to fire at Turkish forces unless one of their own was wounded in a Turkish attack.
 STRENGTHENING NEGOTIATING HANDS
 The showdown in northwest Syria comes ahead of Thursday's meeting between Presidents Tayyip Erdogan and Vladimir Putin, suggesting both sides are seeking to consolidate their military position in part to bolster their negotiating hand.
 A Syrian opposition figure described the battle for Saraqeb, at the junction of Syria's main north-south and east-west highways, as a "war of wills," while a rebel military commander said both countries were trying to impose a "fait accompli."
 "The Syrian government is trying to take over new places with Russian support ahead of the Erdogan-Putin meeting," the Turkish security official said. "They are trying to have the upper hand at the table."
 Turkey insisted last month that Syrian forces withdraw to Idlib frontlines established in a 2017 "de-escalation" accord. Damascus and Moscow ignored the demand, taking more territory in a conflict they frame as a war on terrorists.
 Vladimir Frolov, a former senior Russian diplomat, said the key issue at Thursday's summit was the size of the remaining pocket of border territory which Russia would allow rebels to hold and where millions of displaced people could shelter.
 "Erdogan wants a 30 mile deep zone, Moscow has been offering an 8 mile strip," Frolov told Reuters, predicting that the two leaders might split the difference.
 He said Russia's deployment in Saraqeb was a signal that the control of the north-south M5 highway on which the town stands was a "red line" for Moscow, and would remain under its control.
 That would require Turkey to back down from a months-long refusal to abandon a dozen military observation posts set up around the perimeter of the de- escalation zone, most of which are now surrounded by Syrian government forces.

SAND has many opportunities and events on and off campus.
 “Our department is really big on lateral networking through SAND,” Alaina Backer (senior, dietetics) said. “I joined this department’s club because it’s a great way to get to know our peers and listen to guest speakers.
 “There are also great outreach opportunities to the community of the campus that promote different healthy options. This event is a great way to get SAND’s name out into the IUP community, and we like to get our name and what we stand for out there.”
 SAND is having its fourth annual crockpot cookoff, and this year, the theme is chili.
 The chili cookoff event is open to the community and is from 3 – 5 p.m. Wednesday, March 18, in the HUB’s Susquehanna Room.
 “It is another National Nutrition Month event where we raise money,” Saige Karastury (sophomore, dietetics) said. “This year, we will be raising money for IUP’s food pantry.
 “It’s a great way to get involved on campus and within the community.”
 SAND is looking for eager chili-making teams to sign up. A team includes one to five people, and it’s $20 per team.
 Each chili recipe is challenged to feature at least two sources of plant-based protein. For a $2 donation, IUP students and staff and the Indiana community can sample the dishes and vote for their favorite.
 All proceeds from the crockpot cookoff event will be donated the IUP Food Pantry and Help Center, designed to address the issues of food insecurity on campus.
 For more information about being a part of the chili crockpot cookoff, or to submit a recipe and money, email Saige Karastury at kfgy@iup.edu. Chili contestants can submit their recipes and money by March 13.
 The final event for National Nutrition Month is a presentation by Pittsburgh- based dietitian and nutrition therapist Haley Goodrich.
 Goodrich will present a program, “Developing a healthy relationship with food in a weight-obsessed world,” that is free and open to the public at 7:30 p.m. Wednesday, March 25, in HSS Room 225.
 Goodrich is a certified eating disorder registered dietitian who is passionate about helping people heal from disordered eating and cultivate a peaceful relationship with food and their body.
 She specializes in eating disorder recovery, body image and weight-inclusive nutrition therapy and is a supervisor for other registered dietitians. She is the co-founder of INSPIRD to SEEK, an organization that mentors nutrition entrepreneurs and practitioners who challenge the status quo of the health industry.

The demonstrations against Anpo’s renewal remain the largest protest movement in Japanese history. And while they ultimately failed, a recent book by Nick Kapur, _Japan at the Crossroads_ , frames the months surrounding the protests as a crucible of postwar politics. Until the 1960 demonstrations, Kapur writes, it was not clear whether “Japan would…one day become a socialist (or at least democratic socialist) nation and chart a neutralist course in international affairs or even tilt toward the communist bloc, or alternatively…revise its constitution, aggressively rearm, and revise its domestic laws to restore some aspects of the prewar social and political system.” As it happened, neither scenario came to pass. Instead, the cascade of adjustments that followed the unrest of 1960 fashioned a new settlement that exchanged the political struggles of the 1950s for rapid growth and locked in a practically unshakable conservative majority.4

Damen Oskarshamnsvarvet in Sweden has won the public tender for a contract to undertake a major life extension program on the survey and research vessel S/V Ocean Surveyor, owned by SGU, Sweden's national geological survey agency.      "We are happy to let Damen Oskarshamnsvarvet perform the extensive conversion of the vessel and are confident that she will be ready for another 25 years of marine surveying prior to the field season 2021. Ocean Surveyor is a key platform for many marine surveys conducted in Sweden, not only for SGU, but also for other operators hiring the vessel's unique surveying facilities," said Bjorn Bergman, operations manager at SGU.      Ocean Surveyor will undergo the life-time extension over the course of 12 months. It will include the replacement of the all the machinery, bridge and auxiliary systems including HVAC and a complete overhaul of all remaining equipment. A key aspect of the project will be the conversion of the propulsion and electrical systems from diesel to diesel electric.      The overall objective of the year-long program will be to deliver a modern, low-impact vessel with a good working environment for both the crew and the scientists working on board and better overall accessibility.      Built 1984 in Norway, the Ocean Surveyor is a twin hull, multi-purpose, survey and ROV support vessel constructed using Kevlar / FRP composite for operations mainly in coastal waters. 38 meters long and 12 meters across she has accommodation for 15 personnel across 12 cabins and is equipped with DPS as well as various fixed hydroacoustic measuring systems.      The main deck is fitted with winches, cranes, an aft frame and a moon pool for deploying samplers and underwater cameras. There are two laboratories on board; a wet lab for sediment and environmental sample analysis, and a space with a gamma spectrometer and sediment X-ray for the detailed study of samples.      The contract was signed on Friday 28 February. Work will begin on the vessel on 6 April 2020 and is scheduled for completion by 31 March 2021.

Japanese liberals and the left were dead set against Anpo. American nuclear testing and a series of conflicts between US troops and Japanese residents served to widen the opposition. In one instance, local women built shanties in the middle of a US artillery range near Mount Fuji and kept them occupied around the clock. An even more momentous struggle unfolded in Sunagawa, a village just west of Tokyo, where farmers were joined by members of the communist student league Zengakuren in a two-year campaign against the planned extension of a nearby American air base. The bloody clashes that took place around the perimeter of the base, pitting unarmed teenagers against police with batons, shocked the conscience of the nation. In the face of the public’s anger, President Dwight Eisenhower agreed to a 40 percent drawdown in the number of Americans stationed in Japan. The growing opposition gave Kishi the leverage he needed to renegotiate the terms of the alliance. But by then, millions of Japanese did not want a better deal with the United States. They wanted no deal at all.11

Spurs have lost their last three games, including at home to RB Leipzig in the first leg of their last-16 clash in the Champions League.


  Former Spurs boss Redknapp rated Mourinho's reign so far as "OK" but believes the Portuguese can be a success in the long run and bring Tottenham fans a long-awaited trophy.


  "I still think Tottenham have got probably the third best squad in the Premier League," said Redknapp.


  "He's a top manager, his record shows that. Tottenham's a top club. Fantastic new stadium, great training ground. I think they've got outstanding players. It's a great job for him.


  "I'm sure he's looking forward to the next few years being manager of Tottenham and bringing some trophies to Tottenham.


  "We all loved Poch but he didn't manage to win anything. Tottenham supporters would be delighted to win anything I would have thought."


  Redknapp was speaking to promote this year's Soccer Aid for Unicef match, which will take place at Old Trafford on June 6.


  Redknapp will manage the world XI side while Sam Allardyce takes charge of England, with the names on the pitch including athletics superstar Usain Bolt, singer Olly Murs and former players Patrice Evra, Jaap Stam, Roberto Carlos, Kelly Smith and Casey Stoney.


  "I love it, it's absolutely brilliant," said Redknapp. "I think I've done five as manager. You get together with all the boys from all kinds of sport, then you've got singers, film stars, right across the spectrum and we have a great time. The money they raise, it's just been amazing to be part of it."

The cost and exact timeframe for creating such a vaccine is unknown. Estimates for cost range from as low as $200 million and as high as $1.5 billion.


  While researchers may be able to develop a vaccine for this particular coronavirus strain, it might not be until after the current outbreak has ended, according to the Business Insider report.


  The White House, meanwhile, has been scrambling to address the virus as more cases and deaths continue to be reported across the US. The president appointed Vice President Mike Pence the head of the administration's coronavirus task force at a press conference last week. But was also accused of barring Dr. Fauci, a top US expert on infectious disease on his task force, from speaking publicly about the coronavirus outbreak without approval while inadequately repsonding to the virus.

Cabins operated by the Swiss Alpine Club (SAC) had the second-best year in their history in 2019, with the hot summer especially sending people in search of fresher air in the mountains.
 The 355,268 overnight stays recorded in the 153 mountain cabins of the SAC amounted to a 3.6% increase on 2018, the second-best year in their 150-year history.
 Some four-fifths of the visitors were recorded between May and October, amounting to the best summer season ever. Two long heatwaves, at the end of June and the end of July, prompted residents from the valleys to seek fresher air at altitude, the SAC said.
 Combined with money spend from visitors during the day, the overnight stays brought a total of CHF32.5 million ($34.03 million) for the huts.
 The most visited of the 153 cabins operated by the Alpine organisation was the Lämmerenhütte in the Bernese Oberland, with 7,810 overnight stays.
 The booming huts came on the back of a record overall year for Swiss hotels, which saw 39.6 million overnight stays across the country last year. Both domestic and foreign tourist numbers went up.

The worst is still to come for the airline industry in terms of economic damage from the coronavirus outbreak, European bosses warned on Tuesday, but they predicted that travel demand could stabilise in the coming weeks. Coronavirus has hit demand, forcing airlines to cancel flights and cut costs, and ask governments and regulators for help as they battle to get to grips with what they hope will be short-term, rather than long-term, disruption.The heads of Europes biggest carriers discussed the impact of the epidemic at an annual industry conference. They included Ryanair chief Michael OLeary Willie Walsh, boss of British Airways-owner IAG and easyJets Johan Lundgren. We have seen a drop in demand when you look particularly in the northern part of Italy, but that has also spilled over to the other parts of the network, easyJet CEO Johan Lundgren said.Italy has suffered the biggest outbreak of the illness in Europe. IAGs Walsh also noted a very significant fall-off in demand in Italian markets in the past week. But he predicted demand would stabilise in coming weeks if bookings followed the pattern seen in Asia.I think we will see air traffic recover in due course, he said. Ryanairs OLeary agreed the next few weeks would be tough. He said he expected a very deflated booking environment for the next two to three weeks, but should the crisis stabilise, bookings would recover.I think you will see a pretty rapid return to normal, he said. Yet the bosses acknowledged it could get a lot worse before it gets better.If were not successful in the containment of it then there might be a more difficult outcome, Lundgren said. OLeary told Reuters in an interview that he would introduce cheaper tickets to stimulate the market closer to the summer, if necessary.On future demand for the aircraft themselves, two sales executives from planemakers Airbus and Boeing said that it was too early to gauge the impact. Both OLeary and Walsh said there would always be demand for more aircraft if they were cheap enough. TAKE BURDENS AWAYAirlines worldwide have been suspending flights or modifying services in response to the coronavirus outbreak, which has now claimed more than 3,000 lives and infected more than 90,000 people globally, after spreading from China to 77 other countries and territories. The crisis has led to a quarter of the short-haul fleet of airlines like Lufthansa being grounded.As part of the European airline lobby group A4E, the airlines called for a relaxation of airport regulations which cover slot usage, to help them cope with the impact of coronavirus. That was in line with a call from global industry body IATA on Monday for a suspension of rules under which airlines can lose lucrative landing and take-off slots if they cancel flights for a prolonged period.The airlines want a temporary waiver to be granted by all EU member states on slots, something OLeary called critical, and a common set of health requirements for travel to and from the affected regions. Before we need help, theres a lot of burdens you can take away - we never ask for help, we ask for less burdens, Lufthansa CEO Carsten Spohr told the conference.IAGs Walsh said struggling airlines should not be given state aid to enable them to survive the drop in demand. But there was a feeling governments could take other actions to help all airlines navigate this difficult period. I do think it is absolutely the right thing to do to ask governments to consider what type of support they can give their airlines in terms of maintaining connectivity, Lundgren said.Air France-KLM CEO Ben Smith said that what set this crisis apart from the SARS crisis in 2003 was the role played by social media. Whats definitely different with this crisis is the type of media attention its getting. Social media has had a different impact on the trust and the understanding of people who fly, he said.Ryanairs OLeary said social media wasnt helping but he was confident its impact was short-lived. Theres a lot of misinformation out there. Social media is a scourge for idiots but common sense usually wins out in a reasonably short period of time, he said.

But reading _Japan at the Crossroads_ , one can’t help feeling struck by the sense that the recent revival of activism in Japan has yet to be accompanied by a commensurate return of political alternatives. Whereas the Anpo demonstrations of 1960 stemmed from the conviction that Japan should not bind itself to US foreign policy, the recent protests focused on “protecting” the Constitution, a formulation that recalls the anemic liberalism of pre-1945 Japan more than it does the ferment of the first postwar decades. And whereas the anti-Anpo coalition of the 1950s rallied around an expansive vision of Japanese democracy, the main demand of the recent protests was that Abe apologize and step down for violating the unspoken norms of the democratic process.31

Escalating military action by Russia and Turkey in Idlib risks a direct confrontation between the two major foreign powers in Syria's war, days ahead of a summit of their leaders to hammer out a deal to halt the fighting. Both countries say they hope to avoid a head-on clash, but after Turkey ramped up attacks on Russian-backed Syrian forces and Russian military police helped secure a town seized from Turkey-backed rebels, all sides acknowledge the risk.
 Turkey says it has shot down three Syrian planes and destroyed eight helicopters and scores of tanks since last Thursday, when 34 Turkish soldiers were killed in an air strike, the deadliest attack on the Turkish army in nearly 30 years. In response to the Turkish assault and advances by Turkey- backed rebels, Moscow said on Monday that Russian military police were helping fortify the strategic town of Saraqeb, which has changed hands three times in a month, to ensure it didn't fall into rebel hands.
 "We need to accept that this incident raised tensions between the two countries," a Turkish security official said of last week's attack on Turkish troops. "Turkey does not intend to clash with Russia in any way, and Russia does not want that either," he said. "But on the battlefield it's another story. It's so complicated that an accidental attack on one another is the biggest risk."
 NATO member Turkey has the alliance's second largest army. Russia, a nuclear- armed power, has a major air base in Syria and deployed warships in the Mediterranean last week. Turkey already hosts 3.6 million Syrian refugees and is trying to stem advances by Russian-backed Syrian government forces which have displaced 1 million people in Idlib, the last rebel bastion in Syria, driving them towards the Turkish border.
 Russian support since 2015 has been instrumental in turning the tide of the war in favour of President Bashar al-Assad, who says he will recapture "every inch" of Syrian land. "Russia is taking a very tough stance and showing it's ready for conflict," said former Russian lawmaker Sergey Markov. "An attack on Saraqeb will be an attack on Russia."
 A person with direct knowledge of the Russian military police deployment in Syria said they had entered Saraqeb to show the Turks that they risked a direct clash with Moscow if they tried to retake it. Russia believed the risk of a clash between Turkish and Russian forces was real, the same source said, saying Russian military police had been ordered not to fire at Turkish forces unless one of their own was wounded in a Turkish attack.
 STRENGTHENING NEGOTIATING HANDS The showdown in northwest Syria comes ahead of Thursday's meeting between Presidents Tayyip Erdogan and Vladimir Putin, suggesting both sides are seeking to consolidate their military position in part to bolster their negotiating hand.
 A Syrian opposition figure described the battle for Saraqeb, at the junction of Syria's main north-south and east-west highways, as a "war of wills", while a rebel military commander said both countries were trying to impose a "fait accompli". "The Syrian government is trying to take over new places with Russian support ahead of the Erdogan-Putin meeting," the Turkish security official said. "They are trying to have the upper hand at the table".
 Turkey insisted last month that Syrian forces withdraw to Idlib frontlines established in a 2017 "de-escalation" accord. Damascus and Moscow ignored the demand, taking more territory in a conflict they frame as a war on terrorists. Vladimir Frolov, a former senior Russian diplomat, said the key issue at Thursday's summit was the size of the remaining pocket of border territory which Russia would allow rebels to hold and where millions of displaced people could shelter.
 "Erdogan wants a 30 mile deep zone, Moscow has been offering an 8 mile strip," Frolov told Reuters, predicting that the two leaders might split the difference. He said Russia's deployment in Saraqeb was a signal that the control of the north-south M5 highway on which the town stands was a "red line" for Moscow, and would remain under its control.
 That would require Turkey to back down from a months-long refusal to abandon a dozen military observation posts set up around the perimeter of the de- escalation zone, most of which are now surrounded by Syrian government forces.

However, if the stock price goes below the $0.29 mark, then the market for Novan, Inc. becomes much weaker. If that happens, the stock price might even plunge as low as $0.12 for its downside target. The stock is currently in the red zone of MACD, with the indicator reading -0.07. Traders are always alerted for the move of a stock above or below the zero line due to the fact that the reading is an indicator of the position of the short-term average relative to the long-term average. If the MACD is above the zero line, then the short-term average relative is above that of the long-term average, thus implying an upward momentum.

The U.S. Federal Reserve cut interest rates on Tuesday in an emergency move designed to shield the worlds largest economy from the impact of the coronavirus, as Group of Seven finance officials pledged appropriate, unspecific policy moves. In a statement, the Fed said it was cutting rates by a half percentage point to a target range of 1.00 to 1.25.The fundamentals of the U.S. economy remain strong. However, the coronavirus poses evolving risks to economic activity, it said in a statement. The coronavirus, which emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year, has spread around the world, with more new cases now appearing outside China than inside. It has hit sports events, trade exhibitions, book fairs, prayer meets and other large gatherings worldwide.There are more than 90,000 cases globally, with more than 80,000 of them in China, and infections appearing in 77 other countries and territories, with Ukraine the latest to report its first case. Chinas death toll is 2,943, with more than 75 deaths elsewhere.Finance ministers from the G7 group of rich countries were ready to take action, including fiscal measures where appropriate, Japanese Finance Minister Taro Aso told reporters. Central banks would continue to support price stability and economic growth. We reaffirmed our commitment to adopt all appropriate policy steps to protect the economy from downside risks posed by the coronavirus, and that we stand ready to cooperate further on timely and effective measures, Aso said after a G7 call.He offered no quick fix and said the desirable policy response would vary from country to country. Asked if all appropriate policy steps would include both monetary and fiscal policies, Aso said Yes, anything will be included, both monetary and fiscal steps.HOPE AND FEAR U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told the U.S. House Ways and Means Committee that G7 finance ministers and central bank governors had agreed to do everything possible to limit economic harm.He said the United States was not considering lowering tariffs on goods from China, after a bruising trade war with the worlds second-largest economy, but would look at all options.

A tusker, Thechikottukavu Ramachandran, who killed 13 people and three elephants, was allowed to be paraded at temple festivals again. The ban was lifted by the Thrissur administration on Monday after a review meeting by the Thrissur District Monitoring Committee based petition by the Thechikottukavu Temple Devaswom.The 55-year-old tusker, which is almost entirely blind, will now be paraded twice a week across temples in the state. Weekly fitness tests are also to be conducted on the 55-year-old tusker. Further, an elephant squad with members from both the festival squad and the district monitoring committee is to remain close to the animal during temple festivals. The committee has also stated that whenever he is taken to a temple, the forest officials and police in the area are to be intimated in advance.The ban, however, has not been lifted for the Thrissur Pooram, where it is usually paraded in front of the Vadakkumnathan temple on the first day of the festival. The elephant symbolically opens the temple main door, marking the beginning of the festival. It has been banned from being paraded during festivals by the Kerala High Court seven times. Its last ban was issued on March 25, 2019, after it trampled to death two persons and injured seven others during a house warming ceremony in Guruvayoor in February last year.It should not be paraded for more than one hour says Venkitachalam, Secretary of Heritage animal task force secretary to ANI.

Technical chart claims that Maxar Technologies Inc. (MAXR) would settle between $15.42/share to $16.07/share level. However, if the stock price goes below the $14.06 mark, then the market for Maxar Technologies Inc. becomes much weaker. If that happens, the stock price might even plunge as low as $13.35 for its downside target. The stock is currently in the red zone of MACD, with the indicator reading -0.52. Traders are always alerted for the move of a stock above or below the zero line due to the fact that the reading is an indicator of the position of the short-term average relative to the long-term average. If the MACD is above the zero line, then the short-term average relative is above that of the long-term average, thus implying an upward momentum. Vice versa is the case if the MACD is below the zero line.

Escalating military action by Russia and Turkey in Idlib risks a direct confrontation between the two major foreign powers in Syrias war, days ahead of a summit of their leaders to hammer out a deal to halt the fighting. Both countries say they hope to avoid a head-on clash, but after Turkey ramped up attacks on Russian-backed Syrian forces and Russian military police helped secure a town seized from Turkey-backed rebels, all sides acknowledge the risk.Turkey says it has shot down three Syrian planes and destroyed eight helicopters and scores of tanks since last Thursday, when 34 Turkish soldiers were killed in an air strike, the deadliest attack on the Turkish army in nearly 30 years. In response to the Turkish assault and advances by Turkey-backed rebels, Moscow said on Monday that Russian military police were helping fortify the strategic town of Saraqeb, which has changed hands three times in a month, to ensure it didnt fall into rebel hands.We need to accept that this incident raised tensions between the two countries, a Turkish security official said of last weeks attack on Turkish troops. Turkey does not intend to clash with Russia in any way, and Russia does not want that either, he said. But on the battlefield its another story. Its so complicated that an accidental attack on one another is the biggest risk.NATO member Turkey has the alliances second largest army. Russia, a nuclear-armed power, has a major air base in Syria and deployed warships in the Mediterranean last week. Turkey already hosts 3.6 million Syrian refugees and is trying to stem advances by Russian-backed Syrian government forces which have displaced 1 million people in Idlib, the last rebel bastion in Syria, driving them towards the Turkish border.Russian support since 2015 has been instrumental in turning the tide of the war in favour of President Bashar al-Assad, who says he will recapture every inch of Syrian land. Russia is taking a very tough stance and showing its ready for conflict, said former Russian lawmaker Sergey Markov. An attack on Saraqeb will be an attack on Russia.A person with direct knowledge of the Russian military police deployment in Syria said they had entered Saraqeb to show the Turks that they risked a direct clash with Moscow if they tried to retake it. Russia believed the risk of a clash between Turkish and Russian forces was real, the same source said, saying Russian military police had been ordered not to fire at Turkish forces unless one of their own was wounded in a Turkish attack.STRENGTHENING NEGOTIATING HANDS The showdown in northwest Syria comes ahead of Thursdays meeting between Presidents Tayyip Erdogan and Vladimir Putin, suggesting both sides are seeking to consolidate their military position in part to bolster their negotiating hand.A Syrian opposition figure described the battle for Saraqeb, at the junction of Syrias main north-south and east-west highways, as a war of wills, while a rebel military commander said both countries were trying to impose a fait accompli. The Syrian government is trying to take over new places with Russian support ahead of the Erdogan-Putin meeting, the Turkish security official said. They are trying to have the upper hand at the table.Turkey insisted last month that Syrian forces withdraw to Idlib frontlines established in a 2017 de-escalation accord. Damascus and Moscow ignored the demand, taking more territory in a conflict they frame as a war on terrorists. Vladimir Frolov, a former senior Russian diplomat, said the key issue at Thursdays summit was the size of the remaining pocket of border territory which Russia would allow rebels to hold and where millions of displaced people could shelter.Erdogan wants a 30 mile deep zone, Moscow has been offering an 8 mile strip, Frolov told Reuters, predicting that the two leaders might split the difference. He said Russias deployment in Saraqeb was a signal that the control of the north-south M5 highway on which the town stands was a red line for Moscow, and would remain under its control.That would require Turkey to back down from a months-long refusal to abandon a dozen military observation posts set up around the perimeter of the de-escalation zone, most of which are now surrounded by Syrian government forces.

As a result, many of India's 200 million Muslims are reckoning with a future as second-class citizens. In December, the BJP pushed through a new citizenship law that makes it easier for all of South Asia's major religions, except Islam, to gain asylum in India. Shah, Modi's Home Minster and de-facto deputy, hailed the law as proof of the BJP's commitment to helping refugees, and said Muslims had nothing to fear. But taken together with a separate BJP project to combat illegal immigration, which would require all Indian citizens to prove their residency with papers many do not have, critics see ominous signs. In Assam, a northeastern state that has served as a testing ground for the population register, the Indian government is already constructing detention camps to house those who can't prove they belong -- many of them Muslims.

The International Olympic Committee (IOC) on Tuesday gave further unequivocal backing to this summer's Tokyo Olympics, urging athletes to prepare "full steam" despite the coronavirus threat. "We are preparing for a successful Olympic Games, Tokyo 2020," IOC head Thomas Bach said at an executive board meeting to discuss the July 24-Aug. 9 sporting extravaganza.
 Earlier on Tuesday, Japan's Olympics minister Seiko Hashimoto had said that details within Tokyo's contract with the IOC "could be interpreted as allowing a postponement" until the end of the year. That host city contract states that one of several triggers which would allow the IOC to withdraw the Games from Tokyo would be if "the Games are not celebrated during the year 2020".
 Hashimoto said, however, that Japan's government and Tokyo were still committed to the Games beginning on July 24, and the IOC has repeatedly swatted aside any suggestions of a postponement. The Olympic body said again on Tuesday there was no Plan B, and that the Games would take place in their allotted time slot.
 WREAK HAVOC Any change to dates would instantly wreak havoc on most sports programmes, with competition calendars planned several years ago to accommodate the Tokyo timings.
 Finding a new date in 2020 at this stage, which would firstly need the green light from the IOC, would be extremely difficult, if not impossible, for the 33 sports federations present in Tokyo. Bach, a 66-year-old lawyer and former Olympic fencing champion, has an iron grip on IOC decision-making and is known for sticking to his guns in adversity.
 "I would like to encourage all the athletes to continue their preparation for the Olympic Games, Tokyo 2020 with great confidence and full steam," the German told reporters in Lausanne. "From our side, we will continue to support the athletes and the National Olympic Committees." Multiple sports events around the world have been cancelled during the epidemic, which has killed more than 3,000 people in China and spread to more than 60 nations including Japan where infections are near 1,000 and 12 people have died.
 SMALLER CROWDS Crowds will be smaller and receptions have been scrapped at the Tokyo 2020 torch lighting ceremony in ancient Olympia, Greece, next week as the Hellenic Olympic Committee (HOC) introduced measures to protect against the coronavirus, it said on Tuesday.
 Despite concerns over possible health risks to spectators and participants at the Games, the Olympic body is unwilling to publicly discuss any other option, such as cancellation or postponement. The IOC board said a joint task force had been created two weeks ago, involving the IOC, the Tokyo Games organisers, the city, the government, and the World Health Organisation to help deal with the coronavirus ahead of the Olympics.
 "The IOC EB appreciates and supports the measures being taken, which constitute an important part of Tokyo's plans to host safe and secure Games," the task force said in a statement. Tokyo has pumped in more than $12 billion to organise the event, while billions more were spent on related projects.
 Tokyo Games organisers are due to deliver a report via video conference to the executive board on Wednesday.

The U.S. Federal Reserve cut interest rates on Tuesday in an emergency move designed to shield the world's largest economy from the impact of the coronavirus, as Group of Seven finance officials pledged "appropriate", unspecific policy moves. In a statement, the Fed said it was cutting rates by a half percentage point to a target range of 1.00% to 1.25%.
 "The fundamentals of the U.S. economy remain strong. However, the coronavirus poses evolving risks to economic activity," it said in a statement. The coronavirus, which emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year, has spread around the world, with more new cases now appearing outside China than inside. It has hit sports events, trade exhibitions, book fairs, prayer meets and other large gatherings worldwide.
