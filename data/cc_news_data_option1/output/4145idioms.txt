Once again we witnessed a top-notch bowling effort from the Capitals. Barring the initial few overs when Buttler and Stokes went after Rabada and Anrich Nortje, the bowlers maintained their shape and executed the game plan brilliantly. They mixed their lengths as well as the pace which kept the Rajasthan batters guessing.

As a boy, I enjoyed tinkering with my Dad’s old Kodak point and shoot camera, a simple and small box with a centered lens. That thing was indestructible, and I can recall one time watching it bound down the sharp granite rocks of Lake Murray in Oklahoma, only to be surprised that other than a few scratches, it continued to work like a charm. My folks did not invest in high-end cameras, but they always had a basic one in hand or nearby for family functions, along with a bag of Kodachrome rolls of film. Paul Simon wrote a song about that film, which always conjures for me memories of bright, sunny summers of picnics and swimming in cut-off jeans.

Pixar undoubtedly holds the upper hand in animated movies right now (although _Cars 2_ left a lot to be desired).

Verbinski, whose repertoire includes _The Ring_ and _Pirates of the Caribbean_ , furthers his excellent range with the tale of an abandoned chameleon who has to lead the occupants of a desert town to water.

Thanks to _Superbad_ and _Knocked Up_ , Judd Apatow's name packs some serious clout in Hollywood these days. So when the director, whose movies are typically dudebro-oriented, jumped into the fray of a lady-centric comedy, it guaranteed success in box offices. But success in the eyes of critics? Actually, yeah, definitely. I'll freely admit I'm not always up for slapstick/gross humor, and the trailer indicated there might be both. The siren song of funny women, who so rarely get good play in front of the movie camera, swept me into the theater - and I'm so much better for it.

I had to vigorously defend my disappointment with _Sucker Punch_ both on the internet and in discussions with friends. People seem to think my grouchiness is a sign that I'm becoming hard and jaded and critical, or that I'm anti-sexy women. Nope, guys, neither of those are true. What I am, though, is thoroughly upset with the fact that the movie's plot didn't make sense, that it emphasized eye candy (formidable eye candy, to be sure) over substance, and that it had the potential to be so good and just plain didn't hit the mark. Steampunk, dragons, lingerie, empowered women - I mean, come on, it could've been great. Unfortunately Snyder's penchant for slow motion and fetishes overpowered everything else the movie could've been. Sure, you say, it was silly entertainment. I only wish I'd been entertained.

There is a new 'great game' being played in the Buddhist Himalayas between India, China and Tibet, which makes for a crucial third player. Together, they are leveraging their influence with the Buddhist communities to create strategic dominance, with varying degrees of success.   China's 'Buddhist diplomacy' has focused on Nepal and Bhutan, and the Indian Himalayan regions of Ladakh, Arunachal Pradesh and Sikkim, which have sizeable Buddhist populations and are vulnerable to this influence. The crisis in Doklam brought into focus what will be one of the most difficult issues to unfold in the Himalayas in future: India's insufficient ability to deal with China only through the prism of military power.   If Xi Jinping, who is known to be working towards a resolution of the Tibet question, succeeds, and the Dalai Lama does indeed return to Tibet, how will it impact Indian interests in the Buddhist Himalayas? If the Tibet issue remains unresolved, how will India and China deal with and leverage the sectarian strife that is likely to intensify in a post-Dalai Lama world?    _The Great Game in the Buddhist Himalayas  _includes several unknown insights into the India-China, India-Tibet and China-Tibet relationships. It reads like a geopolitical thriller, taking the reader through the intricacies of reincarnation politics, competing spheres of sacred influence, and monastic and sectarian allegiances that will keep the Himalayas on edge for years to come.

The citizens at stake are not exactly cute little animals either. The character design is unusually bizarre and frightening for talking lizards, rabbits, and owls. The (presumably inbred) clan of hillbilly gophers living in a nearby canyon are particularly horrifying. However, we must remember that these are downtrodden creatures - tortured by the sun, miserable under the thumb of tyranny, and beset by quasi-religious mania over the scarcity of water. _Rango_ is bold and unapologetically edgy, and those are its greatest virtues. Had Verbinski tried to cut corners with the script, the design, or any other aspect of the presentation, he would have left us all scratching our heads, vaguely uneasy, and certainly not as excited about _Rango_ as a lot of people are.

A movie about troll hunting, particularly with such arresting advertisements and graced with non-Hollywood provenance, should have been the B-horror event of this year and possibly the last few.

After having read Elijah Jones’ “Opinion Article” in the Thursday October 1 edition of the Pine Belt “News”, my blood began to boil.

It is apparent that Elijah gets his news from the Atlantic Magazine, Facebook, Wikipedia and our wonderful Fake News Media.

Last weekend’s stabbing of Padres outfielder Tommy Pham outside a Midway District strip club has raised questions about whether the clubs are allowed to operate during the pandemic.
 The answer, it turns out, is a little complicated.
 From a regulatory standpoint, strip clubs can be considered three different types of businesses depending on how they operate. Clubs can be live entertainment venues, bars, and/or restaurants.
 Under the current state and county health orders, restaurants are allowed to operate with some restrictions, but bars and live entertainment venues cannot.
 That makes it difficult for the city to simply order all of them to shut down.
 “There is no hard and fast rule that they have to be closed,” said San Diego Police Department Lt. Shawn Takeuchi.
 So, if a strip club has a kitchen and a menu, they can stay open as a restaurant and serve $2 steak specials or all-you-can-eat wing deals on Sundays.
 But strip clubs are not allowed to operate as bars or live entertainment venues.
 That means no dancing on the stage, poles or on customers’ laps. It also means no drinking without eating.
 “You can’t order alcohol unless you order food,” said county spokesman Michael Workman. “You can’t go to one of those clubs and sit outside and drink and watch entertainment. That opportunity should not be there. It if is, that is a violation.”
 There are some gray areas.
 For example, Lt. Takeuchi wasn’t sure if waitresses could be topless while serving customers food.
 Since Pham’s stabbing, the San Diego Police Department and county health officials have turned their focus on Pacers Showgirls, the club where Pham was before being stabbed in the parking lot.
 “We have been in communication with SDPD regarding operations at Pacers,” Workman said. “We will continue to work with them to determine possible next steps.”
 The police department did not immediately respond to questions about what those “operations” entail.
 Workman said that before Tuesday, the county had not received any referrals about strip clubs from the San Diego Police Department or any other the law enforcement agency.
 Pacers did not respond to questions from The San Diego Union-Tribune. But online reviews suggest the club has been open illegally for months.
 Those reviews show customers commenting on the club’s lap dances as recently as September.
 “Best place to relax,” wrote Sydney H. “Love to read a good book here.”
 Another review from July said, “The women there are beautiful. There are two poles for the women to dance on. These women have the best bodies!!”
 Pacers’ social media accounts also show photos of women dancing on stage.
 “We had a blast over the holiday weekend,” says one post showing a club full of people not wearing masks from September. “Thanks to everyone who stopped by for our indoor service and make sure to catch the show 7 days a week.”
 Other posts from September broadcast that specific performers are “lighting up the stage tonight with us at Pacers,” and that the club is “allowing all of our beautiful #Pacerettes to join us with #NoStringsAttached. Come hang with us, have some fun and let your hair down for a night of celebration. See you all there!”
 Other clubs in town opted to temporarily shut down because of the right restrictions. Deja Vu Showgirls, which has clubs all over the world, closed its California locations because of COVID-19.
 Their out-of-state clubs have seen a pandemic-driven boost in sales.
 “Our other clubs around the country that can open with little to no capacity limitations are doing great, many seeing record attendance,” said Ryan Carlson, director of operations for Deja Vu. “Social isolation has made the concept of a strip club even stronger in an era where people are, simply put, lonely.”
 Pham sustained minor injuries and police officers are still searching for the suspect.
 “I’d like to thank the incredible medical staff at UC San Diego Health for taking such great care of me last night,” Pham said in a statement released by the team. “I truly appreciate the hard work of the (San Diego Police Department) as well as they continue their search for the suspects. While it was a very traumatic and eye-opening experience for me, I’m on the road to recovery and I know I’ll be back to my offseason training routine in no time.”

Elijah reports as fact that our President declined to visit the gravesite of our American troops in Aisne-Marne in France. Elijah claims as FACT that our President said, “Why should I go to that cemetery? It’s filled with losers.” This enlightened piece of news that Elijah chose to share with us to prove his point came from a rag called the Atlantic Magazine and has been debunked by numerous sources as false. Yet Elijah claims it as fact. This is the typical leftist way of things that if you tell a lie often enough, it hopefully will eventually become the truth. This President has done more to honor our heroic military men than his predecessor. And, come to think of it, wasn’t good ole Joe Biden part of that administration? What a great idea to put him back in office to destroy all that this President has done for our heroes.

After most of the plays I’ve worked on over the past five or so years I have walked away saying, “Well, don’t do that again.” Referring to some risks and choices I had made. Not the case with this show. Randy has really been supportive and has made it seem like I haven’t made bad choices. I may not have made the best or appropriate choices at times, but they were never bad or wrong. I suppose the most important thing I’m walking away with is a reaffirmation that I have made the right career choice and that I should never play it safe.

Unlimited distancing does not work, not even in the pandemic (the virus has spread anyway). We learn from the life of Gandhi that the principle of optimum, or optimising the gap between any two factors involved in the transactional life of social beings would engender the best possible result. ‘Safe distancing’, which also means ‘sufficient nearness’, alone would help us keep away from the ills while retaining the warmth of one another as a community, not only in cases like COVID 19, but in every walk of life. The life of Mahatma Gandhi drives this point emphatically.
