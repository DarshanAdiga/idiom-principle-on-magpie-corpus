However, if the stock price goes below the $0.9933 mark, then the market for New Age Beverages Corporation becomes much weaker. If that happens, the stock price might even plunge as low as $0.9417 for its downside target. The stock is currently in the red zone of MACD, with the indicator reading -0.1644. Traders are always alerted for the move of a stock above or below the zero line due to the fact that the reading is an indicator of the position of the short-term average relative to the long-term average. If the MACD is above the zero line, then the short-term average relative is above that of the long-term average, thus implying an upward momentum.

He relished the fact that his ideas — viewed as radical four years ago— had become part of the political mainstream by the next election cycle, as Democratic politics lurched to the left in the Trump era.Sanders began the 2020 race by arguing that he was the most electable Democrat against Trump. He said his working-class appeal could help Democrats win back Rust Belt states that Trump won in 2016, including Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. But as the race wore on, the senator reverted to his 2016 roots, repeatedly stressing that he backs a “political revolution” from the bottom up under the slogan “Not me. Us.”Sanders also faced persistent questions about being the field’s oldest candidate. Those were pushed into the spotlight on Oct. 1, when he was at a rally in Las Vegas and asked for a chair to be brought on stage so he could sit down. Suffering from chest pains afterward, he underwent surgery to insert two stints because of a blocked artery, and his campaign revealed two days later that he had suffered a heart attack.But a serious health scare that might have derailed other campaigns seemed only to help Sanders as his already-strong fundraising got stronger and rising stars on the Democratic left, including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, endorsed him. Many supporters said the heart attack only strengthened their resolve to back him.Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren outshone him throughout much of the summer, but Sanders worked his way back up in the polls. The two progressive candidates spent months refusing to attack each other, though Sanders offered a strong defense of Medicare for All after Warren offered a transition plan saying it would take the country years to transition to it.The two longtime allies finally clashed bitterly, if briefly, in January, when Warren said that Sanders had suggested during a 2018 private meeting that a woman couldn’t be elected president. Sanders denied saying that, but Warren refused to shake his outstretched hand after a debate in Iowa.Warren left the race after a dismal Super Tuesday showing in which she finished third in her own state.In 2016, Sanders kept campaigning long after the primaries had ended and endorsed Clinton less than two weeks before their party’s convention. This cycle, he promised to work better with the national and state parties. His dropping out of the race now could be a step toward unity.Copyright 2020 Associated Press.

But what about when you look down? If the floors have seen better days, it’s time to replace them. You may long for marble tile or exotic wood floors, but these projects are expensive and can be time-consuming. Luckily, there are many affordable modern vinyl options that are humidity safe, slip resistant and durable, making them ideal for use in the bathroom.                                                                                                                                                                                          Today’s vinyl has come a long way from the cheap-looking sheets from decades ago. With a little research you can discover modern vinyl options made to look like myriad materials including mosaic tile, natural stone, wood planks and more. Often you can use the existing floor as the sub-floor, so there’s no need to remove it. Always research the manufacturer’s recommendations, but typically modern vinyl flooring is easy to install with features that snap together and are simple to cut to size.                                                                                                                                                                                          Today’s top bathroom trends are easily within reach when you research projects and products that help streamline your efforts. Whether you choose to do one of these projects or all three, you’ll be amazed how these changes can impact the overall appearance of the bathroom.

Throughout U.S. history, the poor have done a disproportionate share of physically demanding and dangerous work.
 Native and African American slaves toiled for long hours under the sun on brutal plantations. Chinese, Irish, African and other minority group members suffered and died while building railroads across the country. Working-class women and men endured the painful monotony and dangers of sweatshop work.
 During this 2020 coronavirus pandemic, low-wage workers are risking their lives once again so that their fellow citizens can survive in comfort. These workers would likely prefer a job that entails less social interaction with others who may be carrying the disease, but are forced to put themselves and their families at risk in order to pay their rent, keep their lights on and feed their loved ones.

"Know that I do not make this decision lightly," Sanders added. I know that there may be some in our movement who disagree with this position would like us to fight on to the last ballot cast at the Democratic Convention on the opposition."
 Sanders added that he could not "in good conscience continue to mount a campaign that cannot win and which would interfere with the important work required of all of us in this difficult hour."
 Sanders said he would continue to keep his name on the ballot in remaining states to continue to gather delegates, in order to influence the party platform.
 Sanders initially exceeded sky-high expectations about his ability to recreate the magic of his 2016 presidential bid, and even overcame a heart attack last October on the campaign trail. But he found himself unable to convert unwavering support from progressives into a viable path to the nomination amid “electability” fears fueled by questions about whether his democratic socialist ideology would be palatable to general election voters.
 The 78-year-old senator began his latest White House bid facing questions about whether he could win back the supporters who chose him four years ago as an insurgent alternative to the party establishment’s choice, Hillary Clinton. Despite winning 22 states in 2016, there were no guarantees he’d be a major presidential contender this cycle, especially as the race’s oldest candidate.

Technical chart claims that Titan Machinery Inc. (TITN) would settle between $8.45/share to $8.77/share level. However, if the stock price goes below the $7.89 mark, then the market for Titan Machinery Inc. becomes much weaker. If that happens, the stock price might even plunge as low as $7.65 for its downside target. The stock is currently in the red zone of MACD, with the indicator reading -0.16. Traders are always alerted for the move of a stock above or below the zero line due to the fact that the reading is an indicator of the position of the short-term average relative to the long-term average. If the MACD is above the zero line, then the short-term average relative is above that of the long-term average, thus implying an upward momentum. Vice versa is the case if the MACD is below the zero line.

The TV screen’s vibrant colors were the only break in the inky blackness that would soon transform because of dawn bringing about another day.


  But in those moments, the near-darkness and the calm allowed my mind to wander, to reflect and come to some understanding of the past months, the tragedy and the human kindness and the pendulum of emotions that were settling into a simmer but still years away from being fully processed.


  My week-old daughter was in my arms, the first extended period of time for just the two of us. She slept against me. I positioned my arms to feel her chest move and her heart beat, a reminder of the gifts and greatness that can come from any situation. The television sound was off, but I observed as fathers and their children shared experiences that would become lifetime memories.


  It was the Drive, Chip, and Putt National Final at Augusta National Golf Club, and I watched the kids compete, but the competition was far secondary to the personification of the bonds between the participants and their parents.


  I softly spoke to my daughter, Carly Ann, telling her we could try that one day, that I would introduce her to my primary hobby. Yet what I was really saying was a prayer and a promise, to cherish her and to make the most of our time together, to maximize the good out of the situation that brought her to me, to help her find her passions and her purposes in life and to do my best to make her proud while understanding the past that came before her.


  That early morning was four years ago, the final moments of months of volatility, an anniversary of sorts that I’ve celebrated each year since then, requesting Carly Ann watch the youngsters take on Augusta with me.


  But this year there isn’t a Masters in April. There’s not a Drive, Chip, and Putt the week prior, and there’s not an Augusta National Women’s Amateur that has sparked so many girls and young women to dream of an opportunity that was once void of reality.


  I have my Masters memories, as do all golf fans, but the lack of a Drive, Chip, and Putt National Final during this part of the calendar is a much bigger personal loss, pushing away that set date for me to make new promises and resolutions in my parenting while also remembering the difficulties that brought Carly Ann and I together.


  In early April 2015, an anniversary of a different kind, I didn’t know anything about NICUs, mini syringes filled with breast milk or the scrubbing in required that now gives me quite the expertise and understanding as our world fights back against COVID-19. No one expects a problematic pregnancy until one hits you right between the eyes.


  I still remember the call. I was finishing a soon-to-seem-meaningless baseball interview when the world shifted all over the place in a matter of minutes. The 23-week routine appointment discovered dire complications.


  There was a problem, an emergency, and I needed to come quickly. The next hours were a blur, as Kara was admitted into the hospital, a fetal specialist delivered the grim news and there was a lot of waiting for what seemed like an inevitability.


  Clark was growth-restricted down to 20 weeks and Kara was asymptomatic, not feeling the immense strain on her body that could risk her life if the baby wasn’t delivered within hours instead of days or weeks. A day and a half later, with preeclampsia and insane protein levels making any further wait a potentially fatal game of roulette, I donned scrubs and stood behind the C-section.


  “We’re hoping for the best, and I don’t know what to say except I’ll give you a thumbs up or a thumbs down when we try to intubate,” the doctor told me before it began, sending honesty toward me and shivers down me as I’d soon find out if my son was alive. The thumbs-up came, as did a breathing 11.9-ounce child, the smallest successful birth at that hospital, we were told.


  Each day from there brought about more patience, panic and milestones. There were no brain bleeds or other maladies that were expected considering the situation. Each small success brought about hope of this being, perhaps, the one-in-a-million success. As we watched his breathing daily and hoped for other progressions, the hospital staff nicknamed Clark “Superman” for his tiny body beating the odds through the first 14 days.

My letter is not meant to have any bad reflections on the Fountain Hills Unified School District, its teachers, staff or administration. Yes, good schools are important to attract families moving to a town like ours. Unfortunately, we don’t have affordable homes. Apartments like Daybreak don’t work to add to our school enrollment.
 About the “myth” that “if” the Daybreak project gets built it will add to enrollment in all of our schools. First, it has been approved that the project will have 130 designated apartments for people over 55 years of age. There will only be 18 three-bedroom apartments, 10 studios, 80 one-bedrooms and 162 two-bedrooms in phase one. No guarantee families will use the three-bedroom apartments or go to our schools.

He relished the fact that his ideas — viewed as radical four years ago— had become part of the political mainstream by the next election cycle, as Democratic politics lurched to the left in the Trump era.Sanders began the 2020 race by arguing that he was the most electable Democrat against Trump. He said his working-class appeal could help Democrats win back Rust Belt states that Trump won in 2016, including Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. But as the race wore on, the senator reverted to his 2016 roots, repeatedly stressing that he backs a “political revolution” from the bottom up under the slogan “Not me. Us.”Sanders also faced persistent questions about being the field’s oldest candidate. Those were pushed into the spotlight on Oct. 1, when he was at a rally in Las Vegas and asked for a chair to be brought on stage so he could sit down. Suffering from chest pains afterward, he underwent surgery to insert two stints because of a blocked artery, and his campaign revealed two days later that he had suffered a heart attack.But a serious health scare that might have derailed other campaigns seemed only to help Sanders as his already-strong fundraising got stronger and rising stars on the Democratic left, including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, endorsed him. Many supporters said the heart attack only strengthened their resolve to back him.Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren outshone him throughout much of the summer, but Sanders worked his way back up in the polls. The two progressive candidates spent months refusing to attack each other, though Sanders offered a strong defense of Medicare for All after Warren offered a transition plan saying it would take the country years to transition to it.The two longtime allies finally clashed bitterly, if briefly, in January, when Warren said that Sanders had suggested during a 2018 private meeting that a woman couldn’t be elected president. Sanders denied saying that, but Warren refused to shake his outstretched hand after a debate in Iowa.Warren left the race after a dismal Super Tuesday showing in which she finished third in her own state.In 2016, Sanders kept campaigning long after the primaries had ended and endorsed Clinton less than two weeks before their party’s convention. This cycle, he promised to work better with the national and state parties. His dropping out of the race now could be a step toward unity.Copyright 2020 Associated Press. All rights reserved.",

  Several local police departments have asked residents who have tested positive for COVID-19 or is under quarantine to send their information to public safety officials.


  Departments in Somers Point, Longport and Hamilton Township are among those that have published the request in a Facebook post.


  The information would be used in an emergency response and emergency management settings only, according to posts, to prepare first responders and protect residents.


  “We encourage your submissions and thank you for helping us safely protect our community,” according to a post on the Somers Point Police Department’s Facebook page. “Please send your name, age, address and when and where you were tested positive, or directed to quarantine.”

  The U.S. Postal Service is changing their procedures to protect mail carriers.


  If a delivery requires a signature, carriers will knock on the door rather than touching the bell, according to a news release. They will maintain a safe distance, and instead of asking for a signature on the mobile device, they’ll ask for a name. The carrier will leave the mail or package in a safe place for retrieval.


  Customers shouldn’t approach a carrier to take a delivery, instead allowing them to leave the mailbox area before collecting it, according to the release. Most schools are not in session and children should also be encouraged to not approach a postal vehicle or carrier.


  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the World Health Organization and the Surgeon General have indicated that there is no current evidence that the new coronavirus is being spread through mail and packages, according to the release.


  Ray V. Daiutolo Sr., corporate communications for the South Jersey and Philadelphia districts, said that they do not report local numbers of positive cases of the new coronavirus.


  However, as of Tuesday, there were 427 employees out of 630,000 nationally reported positive.

The two progressive candidates spent months refusing to attack each other, though Sanders offered a strong defense of Medicare for All after Warren offered a transition plan saying it would take the country years to transition to it.

Neither of those March victories, against weaker opposition that had been trounced by the Germans, was pretty, but it’s a case of never mind the quality, count the points. The failure in the past to beat similar opposition always proved costly for Ireland, but they now have the look of a team that knows how to win even when the performance isn’t up to par.

Technical chart claims that UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (UNH) would settle between $236.79/share to $244.1/share level. However, if the stock price goes below the $224.73 mark, then the market for UnitedHealth Group Incorporated becomes much weaker. If that happens, the stock price might even plunge as low as $219.97 for its downside target. The stock is currently in the red zone of MACD, with the indicator reading -6.19. Traders are always alerted for the move of a stock above or below the zero line due to the fact that the reading is an indicator of the position of the short-term average relative to the long-term average. If the MACD is above the zero line, then the short-term average relative is above that of the long-term average, thus implying an upward momentum. Vice versa is the case if the MACD is below the zero line.

As pioneers we have constantly traveled into the unknowns of sailing the sea, exploring remote wildernesses and even the unnatural silence of space travel. These were experimental adventures where technology gave us a sense of control. At the moment the C19 virus is controlling us and that makes us angry; angry because we do not have the knowledge to attack it just yet.
 During this social intermission, time and distance are our best allies. Social-distancing is the most effective therapeutic known to us at this time, so we must take it in the maximum dosage possible.

If a person who was working at a school, a nursing home, a senior center, a restaurant or a large store where any of us could have been in direct contact, has tested positive for COVID-19, then all of us have the right to know that.
 The cloak of secrecy around coronavirus information being provided by hospitals and public health agencies is irresponsible and puts us all at risk.
 It is time to do the right thing.
 It is time to keep our community safe.
 It is time to release more specific information.
 Not doing so risks the health and perhaps the lives of everyone in our community.
 This is not about the media and its right to know anything. It is only about the public right and need to know.
 Stop citing HIPAA laws that do not even apply.
 No one is asking for the names, addresses, telephone numbers or Social Security numbers of COVID-19 patients.
 So, stop acting like the media and the public are trying to get personal data on patients.

KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (WATE) --  Before the COVID-19 pandemic, Casey Pruitt had been used to spending some extra time at her family home recently. The first lady of Tennessee Football had just given birth to the couple's first girl, Shelby Pruitt, in late January.                                                                                                                                                                                               Two months later,  Casey and Jeremy made the decision to have their boys join mom and little sister at home during the school week after watching the impact COVID-19 had overseas.                                                                                                                                                                                               "Out of extra precaution, because we have a newborn baby at home, we were like let's pull the boys out of their little church preschool and home school them for a couple of weeks just to see where this virus goes," Pruitt said.                                                                                                                                                                                               But for 2-year-old Flynt and 4-year-old Ridge, being home with mom and not at preschool wasn't going to be a vacation from academics. The mother of three went to work researching lessons and projects she could teach her boys from the safety of their Knoxville home.                                                                                                                                                                                              "There are so many Pinterest pages there, you don't have to reinvent the wheel," she said. "And there are some things I've come up with on my own. Like, 'Oh you know what I have these supplies, what can I make with them?' While the kids are asleep at night I just come up with these ideas of some fun things to do with my kids."                                                                                                                                                                                              Pruitt reverted to her background in education and experience teaching art, something she used to teach on the side for a little extra cash, to create her daily lesson plans.

Technical chart claims that Yext, Inc. (YEXT) would settle between $9.25/share to $9.68/share level. However, if the stock price goes below the $8.48 mark, then the market for Yext, Inc. becomes much weaker. If that happens, the stock price might even plunge as low as $8.14 for its downside target. The stock is currently in the red zone of MACD, with the indicator reading -0.95. Traders are always alerted for the move of a stock above or below the zero line due to the fact that the reading is an indicator of the position of the short-term average relative to the long-term average. If the MACD is above the zero line, then the short-term average relative is above that of the long-term average, thus implying an upward momentum. Vice versa is the case if the MACD is below the zero line.
