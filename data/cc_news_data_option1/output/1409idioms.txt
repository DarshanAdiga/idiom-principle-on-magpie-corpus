Attleboro’s Community Garden off Riverbank Road and Mechanic Street hasn’t had its official opening yet because of virus concerns. But the joint effort of the city and the Attleboro Land Trust is allowing the people who have paid to start growing what they can.
 Juliet Texeira, co-coordinator of the project, notes, “We asked them to maintain social distancing with no more than 10 people at a time.”
 Texeira says that this year the organization can’t provide shared tools or water lines for the gardeners, due to safety concerns. They will have to bring what they need from home.
 Nevertheless, while there’s usually a waiting list for the group’s 62 plots, it’s growing this spring.
 “We are getting a lot of calls,” she said.
 Some of them are from people who simply want to help in any way they can — and get out of the house to boot.
 “There are people who can’t work and call up and say, ‘I’m bored to tears.’” Texeira says
 As of a few years ago, the National Gardening Association estimated 35 percent of households in the United States, or nearly 2 million families, grew food either at home or in a community garden.
 This year, there’s been a surge of people nationwide interested in growing their own food, National Public Radio reported recently. Oregon State University’s Master Gardener program noticed this, and made its online vegetable gardening course free through the end of this month. Its post on Facebook was shared more than 21,000 times.
 Commercial companies that cater to home gardeners have noticed the trend, too. “We’re being flooded with vegetable orders,” George Ball, executive chairman of the Burpee Seed Company, based in Warminster, Pa., told NPR.
 That blooming of interest has held true for local gardeners, too.

The country-wide lockdown has forced shut doors of temples in the pilgrim destination of Neemsar in UP's Sitapur district but on Tuesdays and Saturdays hundreds of needy line up to take packets of essentials being distributed by temple authorities. Though authorities at temples like the Hanuman Garhi are doing their bit to reach out to the poor in Neemsar also known as Naimisharnaya, about 90 km from here, the priests are themselves unsure of how to sustain themselves if the lockdown is not lifted on April 14.
 With a motto "Saksham hain to Seva karein" (Serve, if you have resources), the Mahant of the Hanuman temple Bajrang Das said the temple with its own resources is giving two kgs of wheat, lentils, mustard oil, spices in a packet to the needy. "We are also giving Rs 50 in cash to those coming for their daily expenses. On Tuesdays and Saturdays, people line up here and we distribute packets. With a word of mouth publicity 400-500 needy persons come here," the Mahant said. "We have arrangements till April 14 but after this period if the lockdown is not lifted we will see how we can continue with this. We pray to Lord Hanuman that situation due to coronavirus comes under control and the lockdown is lifted," he added.
 At Neemsar's Lalita Ashram also its head Lal Bihari Shastri is ensuring distribution of food packets to the needy. "We are hopeful the situation will come under control and the lockdown is lifted on April 14. Till then we are trying to provide whatever help we can to the people," he said.
 Rajnarain Pandey, Head Priest, Chakrateerth, which is the place in Neemsar where Lord Brahma's 'Chakra' cracked through the earth forming a large source of water (Chakra Kund) said, "This is for the first time such a silence is prevailing here. We are sure that the lockdown will be lifted next week. If not, the administration here will have to make arrangements for pandits and pandas here as they will be financially hit." "We are praying and God..that's what we know...He will certainly help us all," he added. Pradhan Acharya of Ashtkon temple Aarti Sumit Kumar, who is helping people with medicines and food, is also hopeful that the lockdown will be lifted.
 "We all are mentally prepared till April 14 but if the situation does not improve it will make life of priests here more difficult," he said. "Naimisharanya is the place wherever several sages have performed penance. It is believed that on visiting this sacred place, people obviate their sins. Our prayers from here will certainly work," Sumit said. For Aaveg Mehrotra, who owns a hotel here, it is time to reach out to the needy. "We and others in the business are following whatever instructions are coming from our PM and CM. Though my hotel is not running and like others I am suffering losses, I am ensuring payment to my staff and utilising them for cooking for the needy. We are trying to reach out to maximum people and give food packets to 300-400 people per day." "This is time to contribute to society. With God's grace, we hope all this will normalise and we will be back in business soon with return of devotees to Neemsar," he said.

The other thing I do when I talk with reporters is to be straight. I try not to deceive them or to be defensive, because those are precisely the ways most people get themselves into trouble with the press. Instead, when a reporter asks me a tough question, I try to frame a positive answer, even if that means shifting the ground. For example, if someone asks me what negative effects the world’s tallest building might have on the West Side, I turn the tables and talk about how New Yorkers deserve the world’s tallest building, and what a boost it will give the city to have it again. When a reporter asks why I build only for the rich, I note that the rich aren’t the only ones who benefit from my buildings. I explain that I put thousands of people to work who might otherwise be collecting unemployment, and that I add to the city’s tax base every time I build a new project. I also point out that buildings like Trump Tower have helped spark New York’s renaissance.

Derek McInnes admits his Aberdeen side are up against it when they face Rangers at Pittodrie on Wednesday night – but challenged his players to take their recent good form into the match.
 Saturday’s 2-1 win over St Mirren means the Dons have won four and drawn one since their heavy defeat to Celtic, and McInnes reckons that kind of form gives them a chance – despite admitting the Ibrox side are better than his.
 He said “We’ve one defeat in the last eight which came against Celtic, and four wins in the last five. Since the Celtic defeat we’ve knuckled down and got on with the job in hand.
 “The form of the players, and their determination, has been far better, and it’s much needed at this stage of the season.
 “Both Rangers and Celtic are playing at such a good level at the minute. Rangers are a better team than us – they’ve got better players – but we can win the game and it’s important my players believe that.
 “Funso Ojo won’t make it, and Craig Bryson will be touch and go.”
 Saints boss Jim Goodwin admitted he is still searching for a way to improve results for his side, who are only ahead of St Johnstone at the bottom of the Ladbrokes Scottish Premiership table by virtue of goal difference.
 “I think we probably caught Aberdeen by surprise because they probably expected us to set up quite defensively but we did the polar opposite because we’ve tried that in previous games away from home certainly haven’t won any of them,” he said.
 “I couldn’t be happier with the overall performance, but I can’t keep coming in speaking to you guys and have our fans read the papers with me harping on about the same old story.
 “We need to do something about it as a group, collectively, myself included. I’m trying to change formation, personnel, and do things differently. I think we’re going in the right direct but we’ve had far too many hard luck stories and that’s the bottom line.”

As soon as the virus fades, we'll have a sudden resurgence of manufacturing, travel, et cetera, and a bump up in carbon emissions. This happened after the 2008/2009 financial crisis. It's not clear whether that will necessarily happen this time, because of two things. One, for some governments, this will be an opportunity to implement more sustainable economic policies which would lock in place some of the reductions. And two, it's not entirely clear when global manufacturing will start up again. In some places, like China, they've managed to put this virus under control for the time being. But epidemiologists are worried that this coronavirus will become a periodic virus, like the common cold and influenza, and enter our seasonal disease expectations.

Easter and spring holidays are a traditional time of family gatherings, celebrations and observances. Like many other events and activities, Fayette County Public Health advises residents that these observances should be different this year.
 “We know many families gather together over Easter and Passover,” said Fayette County Public Health nurse, Jes Wegner. “But, like school, shopping and most other activities, we’re asking residents to modify their plans in light of COVID-19.”
 Gatherings of family and friends, whether in Fayette County, or by travel to other states, is discouraged. When people come together, the chances of spreading the COVID-19 virus grow. Although people with symptoms of the virus (coughing, fever and shortness of breath) obviously should not be around other people, even those who are seemingly well should do the same.
 “We are learning that some people with coronavirus don’t have any symptoms, and that even those who later develop symptoms can pass the virus to others before showing symptoms. This is why even people who do not feel ill should stay home,” said Wegner.

Economic hardship and discrimination in the disability community have been a national disgrace for decades.

It is one of the largest federally protected class populations in the U.S. As the current economic system stands -- without a deadly pandemic that will have consequences for years -- the disability community is already struggling to make ends meet and clinging for survival. People with disabilities are underemployed and unemployed at disproportionately higher rates than the general population. Higher rates of poverty are widespread throughout the disability community.

It gets its name from the floors being constantly wet from the spraying of fresh produce and cleaning of meat and seafood stalls. “We write to urgently request that China immediately close all operating wet markets that have a potential to expose humans to health risks through the introduction of zoonotic disease into the human population,” wrote the Senators, in a letter to Chinese Ambassador to the United States Cui Tiankai.
 A zoonotic disease is an illness that can be passed from an animal to a human. "It is well documented that wet markets in China have been the source of a number of worldwide health problems, and their operation should cease immediately so as to protect the Chinese people and the international community from additional health risks,” they wrote.
 "Therefore, we are urging China to shut down all wet markets that allow for interactions between humans and wild animals that pose public health risks," the lawmakers concluded. Prominent among the group of 11 Senators were Republican Mitt Romney, Republican Lindsey Graham and Democratic Chris Coons. "We understand and respect that wet markets are an important component to Chinese society and way of life, but we believe the current moment, which has disrupted everyday life around the world, calls for extreme precautions." Gao Fu, the director of China’s Center for Disease Control and Prevention, has acknowledged that “the origin of the new coronavirus is the wildlife sold illegally in a Wuhan (China) seafood market,” they said.
 A wet market in the central Chinese city of Wuhan is believed to be the source of the coronavirus pandemic that began in December last year, crossing from animals to humans. Last week, China published an official timeline that said that the novel coronavirus was first detected in Wuhan in late December where it was listed as "pneumonia of unknown cause". The letter of the Senators comes after Dr Anthony Fauci, the Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) at the National Institutes of Health, called for the closing of these markets.
 "They should shut down (wet markets) right away. I mean it boggles my mind when we have so many diseases that emanate out of that unusual human animal interface that we don't just shut it down. I don't know what else has to happen to get us to appreciate that," he said. "And I think that there are certain countries in which this is very common place. I would like to see the rest of the world really lean with a lot of pressure on those countries that have that because what we are going through right now is a direct result of that," Fauci said.
 In the October 2006 issue of Current Opinions in Infectious Diseases, it was found that “in Chinese wet-markets, unique epicenters for transmission of potential viral pathogens, new genes may be acquired or existing genes modified through various mechanisms such as genetic reassortment, recombination and mutation. The wet-markets, at closer proximity to humans, with high viral burden or strains of higher transmission efficiency, facilitate transmission of the viruses to humans." PTI LKJ AMS.

On a recent Friday afternoon in western Iowa, a man was waiting in line to buy toilet paper at a local Dollar General store when another customer started giving the man grief about it, according to local police.
   
 At issue was the amount of toilet paper being purchased. After feeling threatened by the other customer's aggressive behavior, the toilet paper buyer displayed a gun in self-defense.
   
 "It escalated almost to the point of a physical confrontation," Atlantic Iowa police Lt. Devin Hogue told USA TODAY.
   
 In the end, neither person was injured, but the initial aggressor was charged this week with disorderly conduct, adding to the recent police blotter over bath tissue. In Florida last month, sheriff's deputies arrested a man for allegedly stealing 66 toilet paper rolls from a Marriott hotel. In California last week, Beverly Hills cops found 192 rolls of toilet paper in a stolen SUV.
   
 So why can't we find toilet paper yet?
   
 Experts say empty store shelves also are caused by a fundamental shift in demand for a certain kind of toilet paper for use at home, as well as kinks in the supply chain between factories and stores.
   
 Yet there is hope: Two of the main ingredients used to make toilet paper - paper fiber and water - are in strong supply. Production is being ramped up at American factories operating 24/7. And experts expect a more abundant stock soon on store shelves.
   
 "I can't give you an exact number, but I will tell you we're making more than ever," said Arist Mastorides, president of family care for Kimberly-Clark North America, maker of Cottonelle toilet paper and other paper products. "It's a significant amount to cover what we think will be used with people traveling less and staying home more."
   
 That's part of the problem right now - not just hoarding and not because people are going to the bathroom more than normal. It's also because so many consumers are going to bathroom in different locations from before the pandemic - at home instead of workplaces, which often use a different kind of toilet paper than used at home.
   
 What's the difference between toilet paper at home and at work?
   
 One kind of bath tissue - for the commercial market - often is made of one ply of recycled fiber and generally is found on rollers at businesses and public places. The other kind - retail toilet paper - is often made of two-ply virgin fiber and is generally much softer for use at home.
   
 This location shift prompted by shelter-at-home rules would lead to an estimated 40% increase over the average daily home usage, according to Georgia-Pacific, which makes Quilted Northern toilet paper and other paper products.
   
 The demand has "increased on retail, and it's staying steady or surged in the commercial market" because of use at busy health care facilities and other essential businesses, said Eric Abercrombie, spokesman for Georgia-Pacific, based in Atlanta. Abercrombie said the company still expects commercial-market toilet paper demand to decline as "business and vacation plans change."
   
 Meanwhile, retail toilet paper demand swelled to unforeseen heights in March, with $1.45 billion in toilet paper sales in the four-week period ending March 29, up 112% from a year earlier, according to IRI, a Chicago-based market research firm. Retail stores couldn't keep enough supply on the shelves, and the supply chain became strained by the demand.
   
 The supply chain for toilet paper "is not built for dramatic shifts and seasonal demand changes," said Scott Luton, the CEO and founder of Supply Chain Now, a digital media company. "It's not like pumpkins during the fall and chicken wings during the Super Bowl."
   
 Luton also notes that repurposing commercial-market toilet paper to retail shelves "is not simple to do," even with stocks of it sitting untouched in storage rooms of closed businesses.
   
 When will toilet paper get to stores?
   
 Getting more product to market is another matter. Georgia-Pacific, for example, has 14 facilities in 11 states making toilet paper. Before it gets to retail store shelves, those packages might first go to a regional distribution center by truck.
   
 "We are working hard to maximize the number of deliveries we can load and ship out of our facilities - you can just load and unload so fast," Abercrombie wrote in an e-mail. In the last week of March, "our mills and regional distribution centers managed to ship out 120% of normal capacity.We also are working with customers to have direct shipments when possible to reduce distribution time. We currently don't have any issues with carrier capacity (trucks and trailers) to ship."
   
 Normally, this is a well-timed process based on consistent demand for a product that does not take long to make in factories. For Kimberly-Clark, the fiber generally comes from trees in North or Latin America and then is transported to American factories in big white sheets. The material then gets dumped into bins with water, where it's blended and formed into massive rolls to be cut into logs and then smaller individual rolls.
   
 "The whole process happens very, very fast," said Mastorides, who declined to say exactly how long because of competitive reasons.
   
 The process also is highly automated.
   
 "So when there is a surge in demand, which we have never seen before, the toilet paper manufacturers cannot keep up," said Patrick Penfield, professor of supply chain practice at Syracuse. "They would love to be able to supply all the demand, but they would need to expand capacity by buying more equipment. It's very expensive. So really all they can do to minimally increase their capacity is using overtime or maybe adding another shift if they can."
   
 The biggest toilet paper makers in the U.S. say their factories are working around the clock to produce record amounts, including Procter & Gamble, which makes Charmin and other paper products. All have the added challenge of keeping their workers healthy during the coronavirus outbreak.
   
 "We are prioritizing our bestselling sizes to maximize the amount of product we can ship to retailers," said Loren Fanroy, a spokesperson for Procter & Gamble.
   
 Mastorides of Kimberly-Clark also said it is increasing production by minimizing the different kinds of packages it normally makes, such as four- packs, eight-packs and 24-packs. Some ship directly to retailers, others to distribution centers where they are mixed with other Kimberly-Clark products.
   
 "Our limited assortment is enabling us to get that product through and into our distribution centers faster, and as we work with our retail partners to get that limited assortment, they're able to build trucks faster," Mastorides said.
   
 What about paper towels?
   
 Paper towels are manufactured in much the same way as toilet paper and by the same companies. But it is not flying off the shelves like toilet paper for a variety of reasons, even if cleaning supplies are at a premium during the pandemic. One reason is that reusable cotton towels often are used instead. Another is that the fear of running out of an essential First World product - toilet paper - spreads through social media and other channels.
   
 "We've known for a long time it's essential for a better life," Mastorides said. "It's something they've chosen to stock up on."
   
 Retail customers soon are expected to get more relief as manufacturers increase production, home bathrooms run out of room for stockpiles and at least some commercial-market product is repurposed to meet retail demand.
   
 "It's really just trying to get that supply chain caught up," said Abercrombie of Georgia-Pacific. "We took care of the demand we could in terms of existing inventory. We tried to increase operations where we could, and then also trying to smartly manage a distribution to get it out."
