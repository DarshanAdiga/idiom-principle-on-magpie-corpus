What started as a simple agenda of curbing police brutality has since snowballed into asking for a total overhaul of the dilapidated and oppressive Nigerian State. No reasonable Nigerian can demand for less. If Buhari decides to be reticent and refuses to restructure the lopsidedness that’s too palpable in this government, these youths are willing and ready to borrow him the ideas that will move our long-suffering nation out of the doldrums. Let me take the liberty of laying out the fantastic proposal for a new Nigerian envisioned by the protesters. I do not see them as antagonizing the different arms of government. Instead, I see it as a blueprint for reconciliation and regeneration. Buhari should thank them for doing what the National Assembly has failed to consider and execute:

SARCOXIE, Mo. — Special teams was the key to a third quarter explosion of points by the Sarcoxie Bears that allowed them to beat Diamond 42-14 on Friday night.
 Holding a 20-14 lead in the opening minutes of the third quarter, the Bears forced the Wildcats to punt on their first possession of the second half. That was the last time the Diamond offense would take the field for the next eight minutes.
 Sarcoxie drove eight plays and scored on 52-yard run by Terio Asterio, then converted the two-point conversion to make the score 28-14 Sarcoxie with 5:55 left in the third quarter.

Throughout her nearly three months in Brownsville, Vasquez worked 12-hour shifts and maintained an overwhelming patient workload. She took just six days off throughout that entire time.
 She's currently spending a few weeks in Pocatello with a local couple who became like family to her while she attended ISU — Dr. Julio Vasquez, a cardiothoracic and vascular surgeon at Portneuf Medical Center, and Dr. Monica Mispireta, director of program development at Pocatello Free Clinic.
 Soon, she'll be dispatched to another hotspot, again working exhausting shifts on the pandemic's front lines.
 "It definitely puts on a mental toll and it can be absolutely nerve-racking at the beginning," said Vasquez, who has never tested positive for the coronavirus. "The chances of you being exposed are way, way increased. ... But once you see see that you are actually giving a helping hand to this community in their greatest time of need, you forget about it."
 Vasquez could have counted her blessings this spring: She worked at hospitals in Las Vegas, where the COVID-19 situation wasn't as dire. But she felt a responsibility to go where she was needed most.
 Initially, she sought to bolster the beleaguered health care response in New York City. However, the terms of her immigration paperwork prevented her from making the move. Once that situation was resolved, she quit her job in Las Vegas and joined a crisis response team through FEMA's Division of Child & Family Services. She was deployed to Brownsville.
 "The pandemic is the closest thing to a war that health care providers have," Vasquez said. "You have all of this training, and it feels absolutely wrong to sit this one out."
 She arrived in Brownsville on July 16 and remained there through Oct. 2. It's a community of about 183,000 people with a large Hispanic population and a high percentage of multi-generational households. Parents and grandparents would often come together to the hospital for COVID-19 treatment.
 Vasquez entered a situation in which time was too short to invest in filling out the usual medical charts, and customary staffing ratios were disregarded. The hospital normally has two intensive care units. While she was there, four additional temporary ICU units were set up on other floors.
 "Working in a hotspot it kind of throws away everything you think about traditional medicine and it becomes more emergency medicine," Vasquez said.
 Even in her dreams, she couldn't escape the heart-wrenching scenes she encountered in intensive care.
 She was moved by one patient in particular. He was a 48-year-old man who had been otherwise healthy and had no history of medical problems. For a month, she tended to him while he was on an ventilator.
 "He had a beautiful wife and a little 3-year-old girl," Vasquez said.
 For weeks, the patient was unaware of his surroundings and was sedated to limit his movement to avoid depriving his brain of critical oxygen. One day, Vasquez noticed he appeared to be more alert, so she reduced his level of sedation and contacted the man's wife and daughter via Facetime. The man managed to respond to questions from his family by shaking his head, and he opened his eyes to see them one last time.

  It was in the thick of the victory celebrations of the then British Open golf champion Bobby Jones that guests suddenly heard the noise of whistles and boots rushing in; there, they saw the unsavoury sight of police caps bobbing up and down among the crowd. Time to scurry off through the emergency exits.

“We gave up the long drive and then we came back with the two quick scores,” Bragg said. “We didn’t like to give up that touchdown, but I liked how we responded.”
 It was only after their defense held Seymour to a three-and-out with time running down in the first half that the Highlanders were stopped, as they elected to run out the clock rather than try to score again.
 Polk finished 9 of 13 for 198 yards and three TDs while Wright ran for 202 yards and three scores, including a 59-yard touchdown run early in the second half that sent the contest to a running clock.
 With the win, the Highlanders secured second place in the HHC.

 "It was a shame, because I really got on with him and I thought some of the stuff he said was positive and the lads took that on board. Peter Grant was his assistant, who again, was good. He was good to talk to as an assistant and he helped me in my development as well.”
 Seeing the Holte End - and indeed the whole of Villa Park - turn on Big Eck was not nice, especially for a measured lad like Albrighton who felt a sense of responsibility.
 “It is hard because obviously you don’t know, well you sort of know that it’s aimed at the manager," he recalls. "But you’re thinking are they not happy with me, are they not happy with the manager because they’re picking you, or picking this side? Their anger is towards the manager but every bad thing you then do on the pitch is greeted with 40,000 jeers.
 "At that point, unless you pull something spectacular out of the bag, it’s hard to turn that around. Once that happens, it’s hard to get back to get the fans on side and get them positive again.”

UK's first 'Covid-19 border' in the works as entry into Wales from coronavirus hotspots to be restricted

Dear Amy,
   
 My wife and I have been married for eight years.
   
 We've always shared household chores, which has worked well.
   
 She recently put her career on hold to focus on our two small children, and she is an amazing mother.
   
 My only complaint is her apathy toward recycling. I'm constantly picking recyclables out of the trash and trash out of the recycling bin.
   
 Recyclables that do make it into the correct bin are often contaminated with food waste which, I've read, gum up sorting and processing machines.
   
 I've gently reminded her of the proper way to handle recyclables, but I am usually met with a "whatever" attitude or dismissive comment about "washing garbage."
   
 More often, I just quietly pick through the respective bins and put things in the right spot, but I feel like that's encouraging her to continue not to care.
   
 I realize in the grand scheme of things this is a pretty minor infraction and part of the issue is my meticulousness, but I'm wondering if you have any suggestions on how to persuade her to care more about proper recycling etiquette?
   
 -- Wearied Waste Warrior
   
 My solution is to suggest that you simply realize that your wife is a nonstarter in this regard, and to stop campaigning and correcting her. I am thereby appointing you the Recycle Czar of your household (your scepter is in the mail). As such, you will take on this job with enthusiasm and without complaint. Furthermore, I'm appointing your two young children to be your official assistants.
   
 Even very young children can enjoy the job of safely sorting (clean) plastics (no sharp metal edges, please). You should delineate a color-coded bin for the recyclables, teach your kids the basics, explain to them why you are doing this, place the clean plastics and paper goods on the floor, and ask them to put these things into the appropriate bin (there are some fun videos on YouTube illustrating the process). Then they can help you take the bin to the curb and watch the big truck take the discarded items away.
   
 If you do this, quite soon your children will start to police your wife, reminding her which bin to use. This might inspire her to get on board.
   
 Dear Amy,
   
 Thank you for your wise response to "Frustrated in the Kitchen," who was so upset that her two stepsons (both addicts) were so often extremely late for her special home-cooked meals.
   
 As a mother who lost a son to addiction, I can tell you that I never stop wishing there was one more birthday or holiday meal with my son.
   
 Establishing a "home" for those suffering with addiction is the kindest act a parent can do.
   
 Yes, they can be late and unreliable and maybe they won't stay long. But coming home for holiday meals can be a great blessing for troubled souls.
   
 A family group like AA or NA could be of great help to these parents.
   
 At the end of a meeting, they always say, "Keep coming back..." And that's what parents should always say to their children.
   
 Simpler food could be ordered to save work in the kitchen, and still feel like home-cooked meals. The important part is opening up your home and making the family feel welcome.
   
 I would give anything to see my son at my front door. Frustrated and her husband can work out the kitchen problems. Time with family is so much more important.
   
 -- A Grieving Mother
   
 Thank you so much for your thoughtful and loving response to a heartbreaking problem. I hope your perspective will help other parents and family members.
   
 According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse (drugabuse.gov), drug overdose deaths rose from 38,329 in 2010 to 70,237 in 2017; followed by a significant decrease in 2018 to 67,367 deaths.
   
 Addiction takes an incalculable toll on loved ones that statistics can never measure.
   
 The wisdom of "Keep coming back..." works in so many contexts, and I thank you for sharing it.
   
 Dear Amy,
   
 Another response to "Frustrated in the Kitchen" whose stepsons were often late (sometimes by hours) for family meals.
   
 She should consider using a Crock-Pot or slow cooker. Then she doesn't have to think about precisely timing her meal.
   
 -- Big Fan
   
 Many people offered cooking suggestions for this question, which wasn't really about cooking, but about "Frustrated's" feeling that she was always on the hook for others' lateness.
   
 However, I agree with you. A Crock-Pot solves everything.

 After recently selling about four acres to Maverik, who Hernandez says has already started preparing the land for construction, Prime Time Auctions has found themselves occupying several different spaces as they transition to hosting most of their auctions online.
 In addition to a temporary office trailer in the northeast corner of the property on South Fifth Avenue, Hernandez said Prime Time is leasing four storefronts inside of the Pine Ridge Mall and has purchased four acres with some existing buildings on Avenue of the Chiefs near the Pocatello Animal Shelter.

“It’s kind of a hallmark American whiskey,” Martin says of Mountain Angel’s construction— American barley, Rocky Mountain water, brewer’s yeast, and new American white oak. The resulting liquid isn’t as spicy on the nose as one might expect from one that’s spent a decade in new oak, but rather quite mellow and malty beneath a surprisingly bright whiff of fresh cut apples. The oak comes through more prominently on the palate, with a hit of vanilla and barrel spice up front mingling with maltier dark chocolate and caramel giving way to a peppery, oaky finish pleasantly tinged with spearmint. The longer it sits in the glass, the more the malt shines through, moderating the barrel spice and mellowing the whisky overall.

Even very young children can enjoy the job of safely sorting (clean) plastics (no sharp metal edges, please).
 You should delineate a color-coded bin for the recyclables, teach your kids the basics, explain to them why you are doing this, place the clean plastics and paper goods on the floor, and ask them to put these things into the appropriate bin (there are some fun videos on YouTube illustrating the process). Then they can help you take the bin to the curb and watch the big truck take the discarded items away.
 If you do this, quite soon your children will start to police your wife, reminding her which bin to use. This might inspire her to get on board.

We are heading into one of the most unusual elections in my lifetime, and I have been around since Calvin Coolidge was president. Normally, the campaigns are centered on what each candidate promises to do if elected, and the public votes accordingly.
 Unfortunately, four years ago we had a presidential election result that turned this nation into a well-groomed hate machine. It seems not only that the losing party has been unable to overcome it, but also that the liberal news media, both in print and over the air waves, are providing the communications necessary to keep this hatred growing.
 I have never been a fan of Donald Trump, the man. However, since he has been president, I have become a solid supporter of Donald Trump, the president.

Nathan Coulter-Nile stepped in for James Pattinson, and nothing changed with their bowling balance. They have a set formula, from top to bottom, with a pronounced Indian and overseas core that has been assembled over the last decade. And this is a team in its prime form, in the middle of their development cycle, the defending champions, and the team to beat in IPL 2020.

A 22-yard touchdown scamper on a bootleg by Rams quarterback Easton Durham tied the game at 7-7 late in the second.
 Then came Rigby's big mistake. With under a minute left until halftime, the Trojans tried a rollout, rugby-style punt on fourth-and-15 from their own 15.
 Highland's Mason Fullmer blocked the kick and the Rams recovered on the 4-yard line. Running back Kaleb Demuzio, who ran for 77 yards on 11 carries in the first half behind a strong effort from the offensive line, scored on the very next play for a 14-7 lead at the break.
 But coming out of halftime, the Rams seemed determined to return the favor they had gotten in the first half — with interest.
 Rigby tied the game on a 70-yard catch and run by Taylor Freeman as the two Highland defenders closest to him got tangled up and missed the tackle.

“You could see visibly how much cleaner it was when we were done. Every piece of trash we removed was a step in the right direction,” Jones said. “Everybody was feeling good when we left, like we were hometown superheroes saving things.”
 Assistant Professor Keith Gilland suggested the cleanup to the club and provided tools, gloves and trash bags. He also helped the students.
 The club worked with Menomonie Public Works Director Randy Eide to have the trash from the creek either be recycled or taken to the dump.
 “This was an awesome project,” Eide said. “All urban creeks need some tender care. Galloway creek is no exception, and the problem is compounded because a good portion of the creek is hidden behind homes and is adjacent to private property.”
 UW-Stout students have worked on the creek over the years, led by instructor Krista James, who recently retired.
 “It is good to see UW-Stout come back to Galloway Creek and keep up the cleaning effort. The residents and other students will see this and will hopefully be encouraged to keep the creek clean in the future,” Eide said.
 The Natural Areas Club hopes to hold another cleanup on the creek yet this fall. Last year, it cleaned up in and around the Devil’s Punch Bowl rock formation along the Red Cedar River, removing many other large items.
 Most students in the club are environmental science majors, but many of them taking part in the Oct. 1 cleanup were just concerned students from other majors, including psychology; business administration; and applied mathematics and computer science, Jones said.
 The goal of the club is to “promote a world that doesn’t need protection” because everyone is taking care of it, he said.
 Along with the environmental science major, UW-Stout offers a minor in environmental health and a master’s in sustainable management. The university’s Sustainability Office works to educate students, faculty and staff about issues and to implement campus wide initiatives.

And Glades, in fact, was quick to credit his teammates for his success.
 “My focus was to win the game and be the best team-player I can be,” Glades said. “Not the best me. I want to be the best team and the best leader on the field. I’m excited the way our line picked up the blitzes, kept their eyes up and made sure they got to their guy.
 “Honestly, that helped me out a lot. I make one cut and I’m gone because now I know I'm left with the safety one-on-one. That’s perfect for me.”
 Joplin started off with a bang. In its opening possession, the Eagles only needed six plays to march 66 yards, culminating with a 12-yard touchdown pass from Always Wright to Quinton Renfroe.
 But Branson cut the deficit to 6-3 after a 22-yard field goal from Cristian Berumen to close out the first quarter.
 Four minutes into the second quarter, the Pirates converted a Joplin turnover into a 12-yard touchdown run by Tristian Pierce, who scrambled around the Eagles defense to the end zone. But Joplin retook the lead three minutes later after Glades punched it into the end zone on a nine-yard carry for the 13-10 lead.
 And with 27 seconds left in the first half, the Eagles went into tank formation and Glades scored his second touchdown of the half, a one-yard run for a 20-10 halftime lead.
 In the second half, Joplin began to pull away. After forcing a quick three- and-out on Branson’s opening drive, the Eagles followed with scores on consecutive drives to get the 33-10 lead midway through the third quarter.
 “The advantage of getting the ball first (to open the game) is you can get some momentum, but the disadvantage is you don’t get the ball out of halftime,” Jasper said. “We told them getting a stop out of the half is going to be huge and we were able to convert it on the offensive side.
 “We felt like that put some pressure on them to go to the pass game more. Once they did that, Coach (Nick) Reid made good adjustments as far as his pressures and bringing pressures from different spots. We hit home on a lot of them.”

Wisconsin broke records this week for new coronavirus cases, deaths and hospitalizations, leading to the opening of a field hospital to handle COVID-19 patients. Gov. Tony Evers said he plans to activate the Wisconsin National Guard to fill any staffing shortages at election sites.
 While holding a competitive presidential election during a pandemic is “tricky business,” the governor said, “People are ready to have this election over, and I think it will be a successful election with very few hiccups.”
 In Iowa, Scott County Auditor Roxanna Moritz opened additional early voting sites in and around Davenport, the state’s third-largest city, to try to reduce the number of people casting ballots on Election Day and to keep the virus from spreading in large precincts.
 “We have to remember that there is this thing called COVID,” Moritz said. “Our numbers aren’t getting any better. The more people I can get to early vote, the better.”
 The pandemic’s recent trajectory close to home has some voters reconsidering a lifetime habit of entering a voting booth on Election Day.
 Tim Tompkins, a welding engineer in Iowa, took the day off work to cast an early ballot at the Bettendorf Community Center. Tompkins, 62, said he and his wife, Pat, were afraid of coronavirus exposure in Election Day crowds but determined to vote, so they brought their own sanitizer to the community center Friday.
 “We’d go through a vat of boiling COVID to get the current president out of office,” Tompkins said.
 In some states, voting early still has carried health risks. Voters in Georgia, Texas and elsewhere encountered hours-long lines that required congregating with hundreds of other people this week. In Georgia, nearly a quarter of the workers in a warehouse where Fulton County’s election supplies are kept and voting equipment is readied tested positive for COVID-19.
 The positive test results for 13 of the preparation center’s 60 workers shouldn’t delay election operations, county elections director Rick Barron said. Barron said Georgia’s most populous county is working to hire replacement staff and to implement additional safety measures, including daily rapid testing.
 Voters in several Midwest states contested by U.S. President Donald Trump and his Democratic challenger, former Vice President Joe Biden, encountered lines when they went to cast early ballots on Friday. Some described the decision to vote this year as one that required deliberation and even courage.
 Robert Baccus, 52, an independent contractor from Columbus, Ohio, was among hundreds in line at the Franklin County Board of Elections early voting center. He said he doesn’t trust voting by mail, so early voting was his best option for casting a ballot while trying to safeguard his health.
 “It’s a choice between life and death, really,” said Baccus, a supporter of Democratic nominee Joe Biden. “We could not do it and our votes won’t be counted. It’s a choice I’ve got to make for my children and grandchildren.”
 Vickie Howard-Penn, 50, a TSA worker from Columbus, said it was obvious Friday that the record virus cases Ohio reported this week had not deterred fellow voters.

Gulfport
 There are only three remaining undefeated Class 6A football teams in Mississippi's southern half, and Harrison Central may be the one that has drawn the least buzz six weeks into the season.
 Following a 27-7 dismantling of Gulfport on Friday night at Milner Stadium, the Red Rebels appear worthy of consideration as a title contender along with Oak Grove (6-0) and D'Iberville (6-0).
 Friday's win gave Harrison Central just its seventh victory over Gulfport in the 43-game history between the two rival programs. It was also the Red Rebels' first win at Gulfport since 1986.
 Harrison Central (6-0, 4-0 in Region 4-6A) was in control for much of the contest even though it fell short of its best showing on offense. Starting quarterback Christian Turner, a sophomore, missed most of the first half after taking a hard hit on the opening drive and Mississippi State commit Jacobi Moore, a gifted senior receiver, was relegated to a handful of snaps as he returns from injury.
 Turner rated his offense Friday night as a "4 or 5" on a scale of 10, but every Red Rebel who got his hands on the ball seemed to make something happen.

The regular season will conclude with Mount Airy hosting East Surry. Since the Northwest Conference became exclusive to 1A schools in 2013, there has only been one season in which neither Mount Airy or East won the outright conference championship. That season was 2016, when there was a three-way tie between East, Mount Airy and Walkertown.

HONOLULU (KHON2) -- The election is fast approaching and many residents across the state have already received their ballots in the mail. but what about the proposed amendments written on the back of your ballot card? Here is a look at what they all mean.

“Did you see the lines? There are three lines trying to get up this way,” Howard-Penn said outside the Franklin County election board. She also planned to vote for Biden.
 At some polling places, workers wore masks, gloves and face shields. Lines and voting stations were set up six feet apart and the stations and pens were sanitized between users.
 However, poll workers are not required to wear masks everywhere. In Kansas, the secretary of state’s office did not make masks mandatory at the polls, drawing objections from some voters, particularly older ones.
 Election officials in Wisconsin said the state’s presidential primary provided lessons that were guiding current preparations.
 Wisconsin held its presidential primary early in the pandemic after Democratic attempts to delay the April voting were thwarted. Voters waited in long lines in Milwaukee and elsewhere because a worker shortage meant there were fewer polling places.
 Several election officials said they were confident they would have enough poll workers, sanitation supplies and protective gear to ensure Election Day goes smoothly and safely. But they are also encouraging voters to cast their ballots early, if they can.
 “Our clerks and communities have learned a lot since the April election,” Waukesha County Clerk Meg Wartman said. “Our community members, our voters, are a lot more confident about how they can be out (safely)….I wouldn’t want people to be afraid to go to the polls because I think we’re better prepared.”
 Wisconsin voter Jon Gausewitz, 37, still plans to vote in person on Election Day. He said that could change if the virus situation worsens where he lives outside Madison, the state capital.
 “I’m just watching the numbers and rates and hospitalizations, that sort of thing, to see where we’re at,” Gausewitz said. “I’m still feeling pretty safe about it.”
 In Ohio, county election boards have put elaborate plans in place to keep voters safe during in-person voting that began Oct. 6, Ohio Association of Election Officials spokesman Aaron Ockerman said.
 Republican Secretary of State Frank LaRose updated a 61-point health and safety plan in late September that provides boards with detailed guidance on sanitation, use of personal protective gear, social distancing and other measures.
 Anxiety among older Ohio voters may have helped drive the huge turnout at an online AARP-sponsored town hall with the secretary of state this week. More than 15,000 people dialed in, peppering the elections chief with technical questions about voting by mail.
 As reassurance, LaRose provided his personal email address to participants and urged them to write with questions. Elections officials are preparing lists of reserve poll workers who are willing to be called on at the last minute.
 Minnesota election officials have recruited all 30,000 poll workers they believe are needed to run the general election. They have cross-trained numerous others, including county and city workers, as reserves in case they’re needed, Risikat Adesaogun, a spokeswoman for Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon, said.
 Officials in the battleground states reported no plans to close polling places, even if virus cases continue to spike.
 “Obviously, we would try to open as many polling places as possible,” Nick Custodio, a deputy commissioner for Philadelphia’s election office, said. “We don’t want to close polling places unless that is what is advised.”

If you plan to vote by mail, you have to apply. Election authorities must receive the application for a mail-in ballot by Oct. 29.
 The Postal Service recommended that Illinois voters wanting to cast a ballot by mail submit their applications “at least 15 days before Election Day at a minimum, and preferably long before that time.”
 Election authorities will start sending mail-in ballots to approved applicants on Thursday. Once you’ve filled out the ballot, you can return it through the Postal Service or licensed couriers, or bring it to the election board that has jurisdiction over your area.
 The ballot must be received within 14 days after Election Day. They also must be postmarked by Election Day, meaning any ballot sent through the mail after Nov. 3 will not be counted.
 Before casting your ballot by mail, make sure you sign your return envelope and ballot wherever indicated.
 Election boards provide various ways for voters to track their ballot.

Overall new-vehicle sales by automakers operating in China advanced 17 percent to nearly 2.6 million in September, with year-to-date volume down 6.9 percent to roughly 17.1 million.
 Strong sales were recorded across the board last month.
 Benefiting from a massive investment initiative by the national government to spend on domestic infrastructure projects, sales of new commercial vehicles including trucks and buses surged 40 percent to some 477,000.
 Deliveries of new light vehicles, including sedans, crossovers, SUVs, multipurpose vehicles and minibuses, rose 8 percent in September to approach 2.1 million, according to CAAM.
 Toyota was the best performer among global mass-market brands in China in September. Sales for the Japanese brand shot up 47 percent to nearly 166,000 on demand for products based on its new global architecture, which include the Avalon, Corolla and Levin sedans as well as RAV4 and Wildlander crossovers, according to numbers released by its joint ventures in China.
 General Motors' China deliveries kept recovering. After a 43 percent plunge in the first quarter and a 5.3 percent slide in the second quarter, its local sales gained 12 percent in the third quarter to top 771,400.
 There was particular demand for the Cadillac brand, Buick-badged crossovers and SUVs, and no-frill light vehicles marketed under the Wuling brand, the Detroit automaker said last week. GM discloses only quarterly sales numbers.
 Demand for luxury vehicles was also running strong. Most luxury brands posted double-digit sales growth for the third quarter. Cadillac deliveries jumped 28 percent to more than 65,000 in the period, while sales of BMW and Mini brands surged 31 percent to top 230,000.
 With market recovery exceeding its expectation, CAAM last week revised its forecast and predicted the decline in China's new-vehicle sales this year will be narrowed to around 4 percent.

It was the fourth shutout this season by West Side (7-0 overall, 3-0 district).
 “It was amazing tonight,” Pirates' center Zeth Groll said. “Once we get going, we are hard to stop. ... I really think we can be good, but we need to keep our heads on and not look forward. We need to go a week at a time.”
 The Pirates certainly were efficient in the running game, as well as the few passes they attempted. West Side rushed for 293 yards on 28 carries, which equates to more than 10 yards per carry.
 “We have a goal every game to have a lot of rushing yards,” Groll said. “We make that a priority.”
 Moser praised his starting offensive line. Groll is joined in the offensive trenches by Trevyn Hadley, Jaxon England, Aaron Millburn and Easton Henderson.
 “That’s what we do, run the ball,” Moser said. “That is our style of football. I thought the offensive line did a good job and opened up some holes. They had a great night. The first half they were blocking extremely well and hard and going to the whistle.”
 Six Pirates had carries in the game. Parker Henderson led the way with 125 yards on just four carries and scored a TD. Cristian Plancarte gained 65 yards on five rushes and also found the end zone. Cage Brokens had the most carries with eight, gaining 47 yards and scoring twice.
 Quarterback Blaize Brown completed 3 of 6 passes for 24 yards and two TDs.
 Brown started the scoring with an 8-yard TD toss to Taze Stegelmeir on the first offensive play of the game for the hosts. The short field came courtesy of Bryler Shurtliff, who returned a punt 36 yards after the Tigers (4-3, 1-1) started the game by going three-and-out.
 The second possession was a bit more challenging as West Side began on its own 39. Three plays later, Plancarte busted free for a 49-yard TD run with some big blocks by linemen downfield.
 The Tigers lost their first fumble of the game on the ensuing play, and Easton Henderson came up with it on the Aberdeen 17. Brokens picked up three yards on a fourth-and-two play, then scored from four yards out as the Pirates took a 21-0 lead into the second quarter.
 Parker Henderson helped set up the fourth TD of the night when he blasted through a big hole by the offensive line for a 45-yard gain. Brokens powered in from two yards out.
 “We work our butts off at practice, and that starts with our coaches,” Groll said. “I think the O-line was getting overlooked early in the season. We took that personal and wanted to make sure everybody in the state knew we had a good line.”
 After setting up the fourth TD of the game, Parker Henderson got in on the action as he ripped off a 75-yard score, stiff-arming his way free downfield.
 West Side made it 42-0 with 4:39 still left in the first half. The Tigers had turned the ball over on downs, giving the Pirates a short field to work with. Brown zipped in a 7-yard TD strike to Shurtliff.

The government in quickly acceding to the five point request of the protesters has been wise and responsive. It however needs to go further to demonstrate that it is not the usual government gimmick. A time-table for police reform should be released while a time-table for other reforms should be on the cards. The protesters should accept government’s response at face value and come out of the trenches. They can return if nothing is done.

Two Democrats and one Republican are running for two spots on the Plymouth County Commission.
 Of the two Democrats in the race, Greg Hanley, 54, of Plymouth, is the incumbent.
 The other Democrat, 62-year-old Jack Riordon of Marshfield, was a county commissioner for three terms between 2000 and 2012.
 Rockland Rpublican Jared Valanzola, 32, ran unopposed in his primary.
 The second seat up for grabs is being vacated by Republican Daniel Pallotta, of Hanover. Hanley and Riordan were the top two vote-getters in the primary.
 Valanzola said he has a background of working in town government, including his elected position on the Rockland Planning Board, where he has served for the past five years. He formerly worked in the statehouse for Weymouth Mayor Robert Hedlund, when he was in the State Senate.
 Valanzola said he is fair-minded and he has his own ideas, but that Plymouth County government is not hyper partisan. His relationships with other elected and government officials are key and will allow him to "hit the ground running," he said.
 Valanzola said he knows how to manage budgets and do more with less, something he also sees as a facet of his party affiliation. He said he wants to help regionalize services for the 27 towns in the county's borders, a goal that all three candidates expressed.
 Hanley said he has a long history in government, from his time as a selectman in Pembroke and previously as city councilor in Quincy. He was elected to the county commission in 2012 and again in 2016. If reelected, he said, it will be his last term. Hanley said when he was elected, the county was at its lowest point and "poised to be taken over by the state."
 He said his greatest achievements on the commission have been securing $90 million in federal CARES Act money to distribute to the 27 communities in the county. Hanley said his other accomplishments include creating regional purchasing agreements for towns to get discounted rates on vehicles and the retirement of some debt obligations.
 Going forward, Hanley said, he wants to create housing for homeless veterans and expand regional trash collection and regional solar collaboration. He also said he wants to retire the county's debt, $17 million.
 In 2010, Riordan called for the dissolution of county government, calling it an unnecessary third layer of government and advocated handing its responsibilities to the state.
 Now, Riordan, a personal injury attorney, wants to be county commissioner again. He said he never called for the dissolution of the county government but, instead, he just wanted the state to take over the jail because the county was ill-equipped to handle the responsibility. Other programs, such as 4-H, should be administered by the county, he said.
 He said the role of county government should be performing functions that the cities and towns inside of it don't have the resources to do themselves. He wants to create a regional water entity to protect the water supply in Plymouth County because aquifers don't follow town borders.
 Voters in Massachusetts have until Oct. 24 to register to vote in the Nov. 3 primary and until Oct. 28 to request a mail-in ballot. Early voting will take place from Oct. 16 to Oct. 30.
 Mail-in ballots postmarked by Election Day and received by Friday, Nov. 6, will be counted.
 A town or city's books will also remain open for 10 days for military and overseas ballots to arrive. Registration can be done by mail or online at www.sec.state.ma.us/ovr.
