I was pretty pissed off, Kim, I'm not going to lie. [ _Laughs_ ] I was on holiday with my family, with my young children. I was on a beach in Mallorca and I took a phone call saying, "We need to get you in for certain tests and things, makeup tests." I was like, "What's this about?" "You have a bullet wound to your head." I said, "What bullet wound to my head? Am I surviving this?" I then got a script, and I obviously wasn't.

Maybe we shouldn't jinx it.

The old Emma would've cut and run, but this loose new Emmy merely takes things in stride. By the end of the hour, Nico has moved a few of her things into Emma's bedroom... y'know, just until she can find a new place.

Just prior to the lockdown, I was fortunate to have moved in with my daughter and her family; and was very comfortable. But anxiety had entered my meditation space and I was preoccupied with thoughts of the well- being of my family and myself. All along, I was aware of starving migrants and daily wage earners, who were helped by many across India. But I had not realized the enormity of the suffering, until I heard a few stories in the Teach For India community in our very own city of Pune. This impacted me deeply and it shook me out of my self-centredness and anxiety, and instead, I felt very grateful and privileged.

New York, which has ground to a halt to stop the coronavirus pandemic, may start reopening manufacturing and construction after May 15, Governor Andrew Cuomo said Sunday.
 Cuomo, however, said that any easing of measures would take place first in the north of the state and not in the New York City metropolitan region, by far the hardest-hit area in the United States.
 "The regions that would be more likely able to open sooner would be the upstate regions," Cuomo told reporters. "Downstate New York is going to be more complicated."
 He said that any potential reopening of New York City, the country's most populous city, could need to be coordinated with authorities in the adjacent states of New Jersey and Connecticut.
 A lockdown of New York ordered by Cuomo is set to expire on May 15. Under a plan for reopening, the first sectors would be construction and manufacturing.
 Cuomo said the state was operating with a caveat -- "don't do anything that's going to bring people in from all across the board."
 Cuomo has called for a two-week delay before the next stage of reopenings, which would include most offices, to ensure that the first phase does not trigger a resurgence of the virus.
 The governor stressed that any final decision would be conditioned on a downturn in COVID-19 hospitalizations between now and May 15.
 The state on Sunday reported 367 fatalities in the previous 24 hours, the lowest number since March 30 when 332 people died.
 COVID-19 has now killed 16,966 people in New York state, accounting for around a third of the deaths in the United States.
 To reopen, businesses will need to present New York authorities with plans that show they are ensuring sanitation to reduce the risk of virus transmission.
 Cuomo said that no full-scale return to normal could come until the reopening of schools, which would allow parents to work outside of home.
 New York state has not made a decision on reopening the education system, although Mayor Bill de Blasio has said that he considers the rest of the school year cancelled in the city.
 Cuomo said that some school districts were studying whether to hold summer sessions to make up for lost time.

Q I have two children aged 14 and seven. They had their usual ups and downs together but since we have been in the house all the time, I feel like their relationship has hit rock bottom. My older boy is so cruel to his little sister. She is only seven and adores the ground he walks on but he is rude and dismissive to her. When he's not locked away in his room, he snaps at her or is mean to her, saying she's fat or nosy or stupid. It is breaking my heart to see her so crushed, but I can't seem to get through to him that he needs to be nicer to her.

We don’t really have consensus [in the sleep research community]. There’s consensus around how much is _not_ enough—we know the consequences of insufficient sleep all too well. When you wake up after four hours of sleep, you’re much more likely to be irritable, or anxious, or simply out of sorts. And we do find that insufficient sleep over time chronically is associated with serious health outcomes. We generally recommend at least seven hours for adults.
