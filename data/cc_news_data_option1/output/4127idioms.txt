Ueda, wearing a “Citizen Kane” T-shirt for the interview, said his influences include works by Billy Wilder, Quentin Tarantino, Steven Spielberg, Martin Scorsese, Wes Anderson and Sidney Lumet.
 In addition to directing, Ueda also writes the screenplays for his films and edits them himself. He frequently works on a shoestring budget.
 His earlier film “One Cut of the Dead” had a budget of 3 million yen ($28,000) but has won awards in the U.S., Europe and Japan. The Japanese title that film can be translated as “Keep that camera rolling,” which is exactly what Ueda did for 37 minutes, or nearly half of the film.
 Cannes award-winner Koji Fukada praised the earlier work as “a film that passes by in a flash of mesmerized joy over pieces of a puzzle that fit utterly perfectly.” Variety said the film “captures all the craziness and exhilaration of movie-making on a minuscule budget.”

Teachers are a keystone of the nation's economic recovery. We need to return to classrooms so that students can learn and parents can return to work.
   
 Yet across the country, students, teachers and families are in limbo, contending with virtual schooling, which isn't an ideal learning environment.
   
 To get teachers like me safely back in schools as soon as possible, we must reduce the risk of spreading this disease to our colleagues and students. I want to get back in the classroom just as much as the families whose kids I teach. By routinely taking COVID-19 tests, even if asymptomatic, we can reduce the school outbreak risk that would significantly set back reopening timelines.
   
 A major barrier to achieving this testing peace of mind is the lack of cost certainty around COVID-19 diagnoses. If teachers like me have to worry that COVID-19 tests might generate ruinous medical bills, we will be far less likely to get the care we need and our students deserve. Testing price transparency is the solution.
   
 I speak from personal experience. This spring, I tried to get a COVID-19 test but didn't fit the profile required to receive one at the time. Instead, I was forced to go to the ER to get a chest X-ray, but I also received an EKG, IV fluids, a flu test and a pregnancy test, because I was in rough shape when I arrived. I was hit with $4,500 worth of associated bills, brought down to $3,200 by insurance, in the ensuing weeks. (It turned out that I had contracted COVID-19. While my medical health has recovered, my financial health has not. Fighting these bills has been a part-time job in and of itself.)
   
 I'm not alone. There are also countless stories of patients like me who are denied COVID-19 tests yet receive five-figure bills for other related exams. Patients who do receive COVID-19 tests have been charged roughly $6,500. While these bills are outliers, tests regularly range from hundreds to thousands of dollars.
   
 According to a Gallup poll, nearly one in six Americans with COVID-19 symptoms would not get tested for fear of unknown costs. Hidden health care prices are, therefore, not only a financial threat but also a public health menace. Hidden prices will delay the safe reopening of classrooms and the associated economic growth.
   
 If teachers -- and all Americans -- knew exactly what they had to pay for a COVID-19 test and that they wouldn't be subject to additional related charges, more people will get tested and fewer will get infected. This price certainty will give us the freedom and control to get tested when and where we want.
   
 Health care price transparency offered systemwide can provide health care consumers with cost certainty over all their care, ending the bizarre status quo where patients are blinded from prices until they receive their bills in the mail weeks and months after treatment.
   
 Price transparency can also lower runaway health care costs. With access to real prices, patients can shop around for less expensive care and find better value the same way we do for auto repair, hair styling and life insurance.
   
 Empowering patients with prices will enable us to steer clear of price-gouging providers that charge $6,500 for COVID-19 tests, $20,000 for broken arms or $600 for Band-Aids. Vast price differentials for the same health care services in the same market will converge. Ensuing market competition will put further downward pressure on prices.
   
 According to a recent nationwide poll, nearly 90% of Americans and 98% of women under the age of 40 support this commonsense reform. Almost no other issue in today's politically polarized environment enjoys such overwhelming bipartisan support.
   
 By providing COVID-19 testing cost certainty to teachers, health care price transparency can make classrooms safer and return children faster, allowing parents to return to work, boosting the economic recovery.
   
 Just like how students rely on teachers to provide them with knowledge, teachers and all Americans need health care price information.

"When a person in our community like Ola is gunned, and you hear nothing from the administration, nothing from the police department, to me it’s a folly," the council president said. "You have a young lady that meant so much to this community. All of the children that have lost their lives mean a lot to us. For no one to come forward and speak on this weekend past is appalling to me."
 Coley said "internal beef" among the neighborhood gangs and factions were responsible for all except three of this year's homicides.
 There's even inter-clique friction, Coley said, suggesting further destabilization among the groups.
 After the latest homicides, some displeased community members took to online to demand Coley's ouster.
 McBride did not go so far as to call for Coley to step down but made it clear too many people were dying and not enough was being done by the administration.
 "This is not a good look, and it's definitely not a good place to be in history," she said.
 At-large councilman Jerell Blakeley demanded an explanation from Coley, calling the number of homicides "unacceptable."
 Coley said her plan to address the murders is "fluid" and changing all the time, based on the intelligence.
 Earlier this year, she disbanded the street crimes unit to put more cops in patrol — a decision some in the department questioned since past directors employed that tactic and it didn't work.
 Coley said she's stationed cops in hotspots throughout the year, and will continue developing and deploying crime-fighting strategies, many which she'll keep close to the chest in order not to compromise tactics and operations.
 Beyond adding more cops to the ranks and bettering technology, Coley implored city officials to give her the room she needs to be an effective leader.
 A former cop, William Osterman, filed a complaint against Coley for telling officers to stand down during a riot earlier this year related to George Floyd's death in Minnesota.
 Prosecutors are still investigating the complaint.
 "I don't think any director in this administration has come under more scrutiny than I have," said Coley, who previously threatened to sue city officials for alleged defamation. "So, I put the cops in the areas where I have issues, then I get phone calls that the cops won't get out the cars. I took the cars away. I put them on walking post. Then it's still, 'Well, we don't see the cops.' So then when I go out there, and I start looking for the cops, then I start to get the grievances that I'm out there on patrol.
 "Folks, let me say this: We can't have it both ways. I am a very much hands-on administration. If I put something in place, I'm going to go out there to see if it is actually working. But for my efforts, I get grievances about what I'm wearing, about how often I'm out in the streets, about me checking on the police officers.
 "And some of this is facilitated by some of the very people that are listening to me speak right now. What I am saying to you is that I have more than 30 years in this business. I am quite adept at what it is I do. Allow me to do what I do without the interference that I have received."

 Onions to me about not getting my mail in ballot. Didn’t get my facts right.
 Onions to dentist quoting a price of services, then charging more money when checking out. This is truly a negative reflection of mismanagement.
 Onions to the nationally-branded pair of hardware stores for continuing to enforce the expired mask mandate. I’ll shop with your competitors until you come to your senses.
 Onions to the city for the road repair in front of old McCulloch factory when there was a water main break. You probably got overtime pay from the taxpayers for that messed up job. I could have done a better job than that!
 Onions to the people who know there will be reduced lanes and try to squeeze in between cars. Stay off the road if you can’t read the signs.
 Onions to the guy bragging about killing coyotes. All you are doing is creating more issues. This was their neighborhood before you moved in. If citizens with pets are that irresponsible maybe they are the ones who should be removed.

PHOENIX — The state’s top prosecutor says Gov. Doug Ducey is acting illegally in telling police to ignore violations of certain state liquor laws by restaurants.
 In a new court filing, Attorney General Mark Brnovich said he disagrees with the bar owners suing the governor that the laws granting him emergency powers are an unconstitutional delegation of legislative powers.
 “When the pandemic hit, the governor was well within his authority to declare an emergency and close down all non-essential businesses in an even-handed manner until health officials could better determine the nature of this novel virus,’’ he said.
 But Brnovich said that’s not what happened here, with the governor deciding not only that restaurants can open but bars cannot -- at least not the way they were designed -- but directing state liquor agents and police to turn a blind eye to bars selling alcoholic beverage to go, something specifically prohibited by state law.
 And then there’s the fact that Ducey’s emergency has been in place since March.
 “It is clear that we are now in a world where the governor is picking winners and losers regarding the economic recovery from the emergency, not reacting to the emergency itself,’’ Solicitor General Beau Roysden wrote for Brnovich, who is his boss. “But that is a legislative function, and not within the proper scope of the emergency powers that are conferred to address the exigencies of emergencies when they first arise.’’
 So Brnovich wants Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Pamela Gates, who is handling the case, to interpret the emergency statute being cited by the governor as justifying his actions to be solely “conferring authority to carry out emergency functions and closely related activities, not as an indefinite grant of legislative authority.’’
 And Brnovich said if Ducey believes restaurants need economic relief -- his stated reason for giving them an exception from the laws that now bar them from selling alcohol to go -- there is an option.
 “The governor can call the legislature into special session to address through legislation the secondary economic effects of the covid-19 pandemic that his current executive order attempts to address through executive fiat,’’ he said.
 In a prepared response, gubernatorial press aide Patrick Ptak said his boss believes that his actions are legal. But he also said Ducey had good reasons for the decisions he made.
 “The pandemic has placed an enormous burden on all Arizonans, both economically and related to public health,’’ Ptak said. “The governor’s actions have allowed establishments to focus on public health while continuing to maintain operations safely and responsibly.’’
 But the governor’s own attorney conceded last month that his client was, in fact, making an economic decision in having law enforcement ignore violations of liquor laws by restaurants.
 Brett Johnson, in his own legal filing, argued that giving restaurants the “privilege’’ to sell beer, wine and liquor out the door “qualifies as a recovery and response activity because it aids restaurants.’’ He said that is because they were previously closed to in-house dining.
 Restaurants have since been allowed to serve patrons. But Johnson said the restaurants still need the financial help because they remain “subject to capacity restrictions.’’
 The gubernatorial edict at issue specifically directs that agents of the Department of Liquor Licenses and Control “shall not nforce the provisions of the Series 12 (restaurant) liquor license that prohibit the sale by restaurants of beer, wine and spirituous liquor off premises.’’ Ducey’s order also keeps police from enforcing those laws.
 Ilan Wurman, representing more than 100 bar owners, charges that isn’t fair.
 “Giving the restaurants the off-sale privilege and letting restaurants stay open, all while closing down bars, seems to be a clear act of economic favoritism,’’ he charges.
 Brnovich, in his filing, agrees that Ducey’s order giving special privileges to restaurants amounts to “discriminating in other respects against similarly situated bars.’’
 But he said the broader question is the scope and duration of the authority that Ducey claims he has under statutes granting him powers to act in cases of emergency.
 “There are not set criteria for ending this emergency, confirming that -- seven months into it -- the governor has claimed for himself the indefinite power to act legislatively,’’ Brnovich said.
 He said if the law is as broad as the governor claims, it clearly is an unconstitutional delegation by the legislature of its powers.
 But rather than challenge the statutes, Brnovich told Gates there’s an easier way to resolve the dispute.
 “The court should conclude as a matter of statutory interpretation that (the emergency law) provides a much more temporally constrained power that must be exercised even-handedly to address the exigencies of the emergency,’’ he said. And once Gates adopts that construction of the law, Brnovich said, she should rule that Ducey’s directive to allow restaurants to violate the liquor law exceeds his authority.
 This isn’t the attorney general’s first public disagreement with the governor over the scope of his emergency powers. In July, Brnovich told a federal judge there may be legitimate claims that Ducey exceeded his authority in closing certain business.
 That case involved claims by Xponential Fitness against the governor that he had no legal basis to re-close gyms and fitness centers in June after there was a new spike in COVID-19 cases.
 Brnovich took no sides in that dispute. But he told the federal judge handling the case that the claims against Ducey “raise serious issues of first impression involving executive authority in an emergency.’’ And he said these “deserve close and careful consideration by the court.’’
 That case ended up being dismissed after that fitness center and others were allowed to reopen, albeit with limited capacity.

"It cannot even be considered a 21st century policing agency," she said.
 Trenton is considered fully staffed with 280 officers, but the Department of Community Affairs has capped Trenton to 233 officers, Coley said.
 Trenton Police needs to hire as many as 40 officers each recruiting class in order to adequately patrol the streets, according to Coley.
 Whenever the capital city has seen a lull in gunplay this year, it's because additional officers were deployed on overtime, Coley said.
 The police director said she couldn't keep officers working long hours all the time because “fatigued officers who make poor decisions ... create a liability for the city and the residents that we’re supposed to serve.”
 Trenton council president Kathy McBride was skeptical of the police director's suggestion that reducing violent crime in Trenton is as simple as getting more boots on the ground.
 She pointed to the 31 murders in 2005 at the height of the gang wars, saying Trenton Police had a near-full complement of cops then and it didn't seem to make a difference.
 "We had 29 hours of death with a complete force. I don't believe policing is the way out," McBride said. "We're gonna have to do something different because what we're doing is not working."
 She suggested Trenton will remain in a rut until it addresses social iniquities like "concentrated poverty" and an ailing education system.
 Trenton isn't alone as cities across the U.S. have seen a spike in the number of murders and shootings even while overall crime is down, according to media reports.
 The capital city is is on the way to breaking its all-time murder record of 37, set in 2013, with 32 homicides in 2020. It so far has eclipsed the number of killings in had the last two years.
 The two latest victims, Ola Williams, 61, and Jaquise Melvin, 26, both of Trenton, were killed within an hour of each other Sunday night.
 Williams was a longtime truancy officer for the Trenton Board of Education, McBride said, calling for a moment of silence at the meeting.
