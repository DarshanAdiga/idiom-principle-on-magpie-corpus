After the FIR, three out of four accused surrendered in front of Modasa police team on January 12, while the fourth — Satish Bharvad is still on the run. After huge public outcry by Dalit rights activists over the alleged inefficiency by local police, Gujarat Director General of Police (DGP) transferred the case to state CID Crime unit on January 12 and also suspended police inspector NK Rabari of Modasa Town police station, who allegedly refused to lodge missing or abduction report of the woman in the first place.

"The news just continues to get worse, and the travel ban puts an exclamation point on the weakness we're going to see in global GDP and, in turn, the US," said Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab.
 "We're starting to get a sense of how dire the impact on the economy is going to be. Each day the news doesn't get better, it gets worse. It now has hit Main Street to a more significant degree."
 Stocks fell so fast on Wall Street at the opening bell that they triggered an automatic, 15-minute trading halt for the second time this week.
 The so-called circuit breakers were first adopted after the 1987 crash, and until this week had not been tripped since 1997.
 The Dow briefly turned upward and halved its losses at one point in the afternoon after the Federal Reserve announced it would step in to ease "highly unusual disruptions" in the Treasury market. But the burst of momentum quickly faded.
 Mr Trump often points proudly to the big rise on Wall Street under his administration and warned a crowd at a rally last August that "whether you love me or hate, you gotta vote for me," or else your investments will go "down the tubes".
 Just last month, the Dow was boasting a nearly 50% gain since Mr Trump took the oath of office in January 2017. By Thursday's close, the Dow was clinging to a 6.9% gain, though it was still up nearly 16% since just before Mr Trump's election in November 2016.
 On Wednesday, the Dow finished the day down more than 20% from its all-time high, set just last month, officially entering what is known as a bear market for the first time in over a decade.

The safety of student athletes is the top priority.
   
 That's what regional athletic directors said regarding the N.C. High School Athletic Association's announcement Thursday that it has suspended all athletic activities, effective Friday at 11:59 p.m. through at least April 6 due to the threat of COVID-19.
   
 This includes all games, practices and offseason workouts.
   
 The NCHSAA had already postponed Saturday's state basketball championship games in Raleigh and in Chapel Hill.
   
 "As much as we would like this opportunity for our student-athletes, coaches, and their communities, we know that ultimately any decision we make must err on the side of caution," said NCHSAA Commissioner Que Tucker in a statement.
   
 Earlier Friday, the Atlantic Coast Conference and other conference across the country cancelled the remainder of their men's basketball tournaments.
   
 The NBA also suspended play late Wednesday night.
   
 "Every sport entity is taking some precaution by either not playing or limiting access," said Greg Grantham, coordinator of athletics for Onslow County Schools. "So obviously the high schools and middle schools need to follow suit. From my standpoint, this is a good decision by the NCHSAA. The health and well-being of our student athletes is what's most important."
   
 Regional athletic directors agree.
   
 "I coach baseball, that's my passion and I realize I'm guilty where I think it's the most important thing, but in the big picture, sports are minor," New Bern AD Stephen Hardee said. "And obviously this will be a financial hit for all of us, but the well-being of our children is what matters the most. The NCHSAA is genuinely concerned about their safety. None of us take this lightly."
   
 South Lenoir AD Lisa Smith said she's told her athletes the decision to suspend sports is an attempt to slow down the spread of the coronavirus.
   
 "As a coach and AD, I'm trying to explain to my athletes that there are people walking around who are carriers and that it's being spread to other people," she said. "If we can't control something, it's best to shut things down for a bit."
   
 Jacksonville AD Dave Miller said he and other athletic directors anticipated this move by the NCHSAA.
   
 "You kind of knew it was coming after they cancelled the ACC Tournament in Greensboro," he said. "But the question is now how much longer will school be in. We don't know that. If they stop sporting events, unfortunately school is probably next."
   
 Miller confirmed his school will still play host to East Duplin in baseball, girls' soccer and softball Thursday night.
   
 Still, he said several of his athletes have asked questions about the next step toward returning to the fields.
   
 "It's like when we get a hurricane," Miller said. "The kids ask questions and you try to give them the right answers to the best of your knowledge."
   
 Smith agreed.
   
 "It breaks the hearts of the coaches and the kids to not be playing," she said. "Some of the kids don't understand. We tell them that this thing is everywhere and that we are trying to keep it from getting worse."

While Trump and Bannon may have their personal differences, it is clear that they're working in tandem. The constellation of right-wing actors that form the alliance colloquially known as Bannon World are firmly on team Trump, as was obvious at last month's Conservative Political Action Conference, which has become, for all intents and purposes, an arm of the Trump campaign. (The conference is run by Matt Schlapp, whose wife Mercedes works for the Trump campaign. Matt Schlapp and his roster of speakers at the four-day conference almost all effusively praised the president, with many urging his reelection.) Bannon World speakers at CPAC included former White House adviser Sebastian Gorka, Brexit Party Chairman Nigel Farage, Brazilian politician Eduardo Bolsonaro and China critic Gordon Chang.

Rejecting change and refusing to listen to the electorate on climate are stances that mainline Democrats have held for years, as shown in recent years by people like Sen.

CHAPEL HILL — Count the spring prep athletics season as a victim of the Coronavirus.
 The NCHSAA voted to suspend all interscholastic athletics indefinitely on March 12. The ban goes into effect at 11:59 p.m. March 13 and will go until at least April 6 for “all workouts, skill development, practices and contests”
 The NCHSAA also decided to postpone the 2020 boys’ and girls’ basketball state championships indefinitely.
 “As much as we would like this opportunity for our student-athletes, coaches, and their communities, we know that ultimately any decision we make must err on the side of caution,” said Commissioner Que Tucker in a statement.
 Watauga does not have any teams in the state basketball championships, but has several teams participating in athletics this spring. Watauga has baseball, softball, boys’ and girls’ track and field, boys’ and girls’ lacrosse, boys’ tennis and girls’ soccer and boys’ golf.
 Watauga has events in girls’ soccer, girls’ and boys’ lacrosse on March 12 and softball and baseball on March 13.
