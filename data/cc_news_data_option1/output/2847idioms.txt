Davidson County Sheriff Richie Simmons has been named the Sheriff of the Year by the North Carolina Law Enforcement Torch Run for Special Olympics.
   
 The annual award is given to a sheriff in the state that actively supports North Carolina Special Olympics through participation in events, fund raising efforts and other events.
   
 Leslie Moyar, vice president of development for the North Carolina Law Enforcement Torch Run for Special Olympics, said Simmons was chosen because he has encouraged his deputies and other employees to participate in events, as well as, developing programs to raise funds for Special Olympics.
   
 She said the Davidson County Sheriff's Office raised almost $50,000 for the organization last year. They have already raised approximately $13,000 for Special Olympics this year.
   
 "The Davidson County Sheriff's Department has been a standout across the state," Moyar said. "They are one of the leaders for our mission…The Davidson County Sheriff's department has been a stand out across the state, they are one of the leaders for our mission… He represents a mission of inclusion in his community and supports our athletes through the torch run, fundraising and allowing his officers to be part of the community initiative."
   
 Besides the annual law enforcement torch run, the Davidson County Sheriff's Office have participated in several fundraisers such as the Work Out of the Day for Inclusion, the Cops on Top at Chick-fil-a; the Polar Plunge at Wet N' Wild in Greensboro, various raffles and its annual golf tournament.
   
 Simmons said he is very appreciative of the recognition, but he feels the honor represents the entire department, especially Det. Jeremy Parks and Det. Jonathan Todd who currently sit on the N.C. Law Enforcement Torch Run Council.
   
 "I feel like I am working off my two deputies that do this," Simmons said. "I do give them opportunity, but they are the heroes of this; I just fan the flame. When I see talent and inspiration like these guys have, it is easy to get on board. Whatever they come up with the whole department comes together to support them."
   
 Stephanie Wilkerson, a Davidson County Special Olympic athlete and ambassador, said Simmons has always shown his support for Special Olympics, even before he became sheriff. She said the athletes appreciate his participation.
   
 "He is a friend to Special Olympics by fundraising and participation," Wilkerson said. "Whenever Special Olympics hosts and event locally, you know Sheriff Richie will make an appearance to greet and chat with the athletes…Not only does he take part, but he also encourages his staff to participate as well to support our cause. On behalf of the athletes here in Davidson County, as well as across the state, I want to personally thank Sheriff Simmons for his support of Special Olympics and the love and time he shares with athletes."
   
 Lieutenant Bill Davis, director of the North Carolina Law Enforcement Torch Run for Special Olympics, said the organization values Simmons dedication to their cause.
   
 "We really appreciate what your sheriff's department is doing, and standing behind his officers and showing them leadership," Davis said. "Without that it would not happen. We are honored to be part of this and greatly appreciate having two of your deputies on the state council. They have been outstanding and we hope to have them for many more years to come."
   
 Simmons said Special Olympics and the Law Enforcement Torch Run is a very important cause which he wholeheartedly supports and will continue to support.
   
 "We all work together because of our love for the Special Olympians and we are going to continue that," Simmons said. "They are a part of us and always will be. I can't thank them enough for letting us be part of their lives. It is our honor and we look forward to a long relationship. For ten years it has been going on and the flame will keep going long after I am gone."

"At least one person taken into custody on an assault charge" -- exactly one person was arrested, Caryn Sodaro; it's reported that she was spat upon. How many hundreds of false arrests of Caryn Sodaro would it take for local media to pick up on her extraordinary story? Caryn is far and away DPD's favorite person to arrest and the toll of perjurious affidavits and false arrests is mind-boggling by this point. She may be verbally pugnacious, but that's no justification for dozens of false arrests -- these are all serious crimes on the part of DPD! I've witnessed unidentified District 6 supervisors commit vehicular assault in broad daylight against Caryn and others; it's no surprise that she was targeted for arrest yet again by the criminals running DPD.

The album grows livelier with each track, and by the time "hope in azania" and "the speculative fourth" come around, the horns are markedly brighter and the pace is quicker. The former aligns with the Black Liberation jazz of yesteryear — to the vintage spiritual music released on storied labels like Strata-East, Impulse! and ESP-Disk — while the latter has an indelible swing. In the end, _Dialectic Soul_ isn't just remarkable, it's incredibly timely, coming to a world still grappling with classism, politics and race relations. In that way, South Africa's issues align with America's, and as centuries of mistreatment have come to a head in the States, _Dialectic Soul_ is a stunning protest album meant to soundtrack resistance anywhere in the world. Gamedze is a voice for everyone demanding to be heard.

ATLANTA (WALB) - Drivers who have been putting the pedal to the metal during the COVID-19 pandemic need to hit the brakes, or expect to see blue lights in the rearview mirror when the “Operation Southern Shield” speed enforcement and awareness campaign begins Monday, July 20.The southeastern regional campaign returns for a fourth year after reducing traffic deaths in Georgia in the first three years of the week-long enforcement period compared to the week before and after the enforcement effort.This year’s “Southern Shield” campaign reinforces the message on the dangers of driving above the legal speed limit as fewer vehicles traveling on interstates and major highways during the pandemic have contributed to an increase in speeding in Georgia and the nation.”The sharp decrease in the number of people traveling on our roads during the pandemic has not led to a corresponding drop in the number of traffic deaths according to preliminary data from the Georgia Department of Transportation,” Governor’s Office of Highway Safety Director Allen Poole said. “The increased speeding this year is further proof driving over the speed limit significantly increases your chances of being in a crash that results in severe or fatal injuries.”The Governor's Office of Highway SafetyPreliminary data from the Georgia Department of Transportation shows Southern Shield has saved lives in Georgia in the last three years. When the campaign was held July 15-21 last year, the number of traffic deaths in Georgia was 29 percent lower in the final two weeks of the month compared to the first two. Seventy people were killed in traffic crashes from July 1-14 and 50 from July 15-29.In the first year of the enforcement campaign, Operation Southern Shield reduced traffic deaths in Georgia by 35 percent in 2017 compared to the week before and after the July 17-23 enforcement period. In 2018, the number of traffic deaths in the state was 22 percent lower during Southern Shield week compared to the week after the July 16-22 speed enforcement and awareness campaign.In Georgia, almost one out of every five traffic deaths in 2018 was due to speeding. There were 267 speed-related fatalities in 2018, which was a 25 percent increase over a five- year period. According to NHTSA, speeding has been a factor in almost one- third of all motor vehicle fatalities in the last 20 years. In 2018, speeding killed 9,718 people nationwide.“The objective this week is not to write tickets but to show everyone that driving the speed limit and with your focus on the road saves lives,” Poole said. “That is why Southern Shield has saved lives in its first three years. So many drivers were following the law because they knew state troopers and local law enforcement officers were on patrol. That is why traffic enforcement remains the most effective method to prevent people from being killed in traffic crashes.”Those traveling in Georgia during Southern Shield week July 20-26 can expect to see state troopers, sheriff’s deputies and police officers enforcing all traffic laws. The goal will be to prevent crashes by stopping motorists who are endangering public safety on Georgia roads by speeding, driving distracted, driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs and other violations of the state’s traffic laws.Copyright 2020 WALB.

It's so wonderful to see these three women have this friendship where they go through some stuff. They are brutally honest with each other, but they are always speaking to each other with love. The writers of the show and Lena hit the nail on the head. We do have lots of opinions. At the end of the day, it all comes back to love and camaraderie and to be 100% authentic with the people that have chosen to do life with you."
