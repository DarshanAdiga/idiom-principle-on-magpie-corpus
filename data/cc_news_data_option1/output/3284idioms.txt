Now I found myself lifted up into the air by a forklift onto a trailer, which would cart me to a home on the Lower Blanco. I strained my ears as I listened to plans the new owner shared as she excitedly rambled on and on about me. The man on the tractor, known as Sweet Al, wrapped a chain around my bumper and pulled me off with a big yank. Oh, the pain I felt as my bones creaked and my steel frame bent and stretched.

A doctor checking comatose COVID-19 patients for signs of a stroke instead stumbled onto a new clue about how the virus may harm the lungs -- thanks to a test that used tiny air bubbles and a robot.
 Dr. Alexandra Reynolds, a neurologist at New York's Mount Sinai Health System, initially was baffled as she tracked “the cacophony of sound” made by those harmless bubbles passing through the bloodstream of patient after patient.
 Yet the weird finding excited lung specialists who now are studying if it helps explain why often, the sickest coronavirus patients don't get enough oxygen despite being on ventilators.

Washington [US], Aug 20 (ANI): US President Donald Trump on Wednesday (local time) said that the suspension of subsidies to Hong Kong will bring in business to the United States.   Replying to a question on the recent arrest of Hong Kong media tycoon Jimmy Lai, Trump said, "I sent him best wishes. I hear he is a wonderful gentleman and a brave man."   He further said, "We have given all sorts of incentives to Hong Kong so that freedom will be upheld in the city. It helped the city become a business hot spot. However, now with the freedom of Hong Kong being taken away by China, the US is no longer giving them the incentives."   The business that earlier was in Hong Kong will come back to the US including the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq, he added.   Earlier in the day, the US has suspended three bilateral agreements with the Chinese Communist Party over the imposition of National Security Law in Hong Kong.   China had imposed the draconian National Security Law in Hong Kong, which crushed the freedoms of the city's citizens. The legislation, which came into effect on July 1, punishes what Beijing terms secession, subversion, terrorism and foreign interference with up to life in prison.   "The Chinese Communist Party has taken drastic steps to erode the high degree of autonomy that Beijing itself promised to the United Kingdom and the people of Hong Kong for 50 years under the UN-registered Sino-British Joint Declaration," the statement released by the US Department of State read.   "President Trump has made clear that the United States will, therefore, treat Hong Kong as 'one country, one system' and take action against individuals who have crushed the freedoms of the people of Hong Kong," said Morgan Ortagus, the Department Spokesperson.   He further said, "The President's Executive Order on Hong Kong Normalization (E.O. 13936) set forth a number of responses to Beijing's actions, including suspending and eliminating preferential treatment for Hong Kong."   "As part of the ongoing implementation measures, we notified the Hong Kong authorities on August 19 of our suspension or termination of three bilateral agreements. These agreements covered the surrender of fugitive offenders, the transfer of sentenced persons, and reciprocal tax exemptions on income derived from the international operation of ships," Ortagus added.

She says: "I think you have to take each patient as an individual.
 "There are common themes of poor mobility if you've had somebody who has a significant weight loss when they've been in.
 "For a lot of patients, because their sense of taste has been altered, they're not hungry and they don't want to eat when they get home. So their actual recovery process can be slow."
 ## Patient support
 With a growing body of evidence to show there can be long-term physical or mental effects after contracting coronavirus, the Scottish government is setting up a National Rehabilitation Board to support patients.
 It comes against a backdrop where there have been shortages of physiotherapists, psychologists and occupational therapists.
 The government is setting out a framework to assist health boards and health and social care partnerships across Scotland following the pandemic.

“We made it month by month to see if there were going to be any issues. There haven’t been any other then a few complaints,” said Thompson. “Nothing’s going to change. They’re still at 25 percent capacity indoors,” she said.
 After Councilman Uri Feiner raised concern about ending the relief just as Canal-O-Ween begins, council agreed to extend the loosening of restrictions through the end of the year.
 With this week’s vote, restaurants and eateries can continue offering the outdoor dining option through the end of the year without having to meet parking requirements and with a discount on tent permit fees.
 “I’m very thankful we have businesses that invest in Yardley. They are doing their best to keep going and the public is doing their best to support them,” said Councilman Uri Feiner. “To give them this extra time, instead of having to live month by month, and let them plan their finances is really important.”
 Prior to the vote, West College Avenue resident Dawn Perlmutter raised concern about outdoor dining in front of the Vault, which she said creates an obstacle course for pedestrians and forces people into the street to circumvent the tables, chairs and umbrellas.
 “I certainly appreciate that the restaurants need to have outdoor dining, but the sidewalk in front of the Vault is really problematic. You cannot walk on that sidewalk,” she said. “It has to be a safety hazard. Here you’re extending this a couple more months. It’s just inviting an issue to happen. The others are in parking lots and don’t seem to be as much of a problem.”
 Feiner said those issues can be addressed on a case-by-case basis, but said it wasn’t a reason not to extend the ordinance waivers through the end of the year.
 “Individual issues are relevant. And business by business, we need to sort those out. It’s been brought to our attention. It’s something we have to work out. But the overarching issue here is we need to do what we can to keep these businesses in business,” said Feiner.
 In other action, council voted unanimously to formally accept the resignation of Councilman Ryan Berry. Berry submitted his resignation to council at the end of July.
