“You can’t make money on local shows. You’re doing it for the love of music and you’d probably lose money, maybe you’d break even,” says Mike Schoder, owner of the Granada Theater and Sundown at the Granada. “We have to wait for the national tours. That’s really the only thing that we can do with a venue that pulls in that 500 to 1,000 range.”

In addition to the hundreds of ballots submitted by someone who later passed away, thousands of absentee ballots were invalidated because of signature problems or late arrival. Benson is advocating for legislative changes to address those issues in the general election.
 For instance, she supports requiring clerks to contact any voter whose signature on the ballot does not match existing records. The voter would then have the opportunity to verify their signature in person.
 Benson is also in favor of legislation that would allow election officials to count mail-in ballots up to two days after election day if they were postmarked by election day -- a practice members of the Trump campaign have taken issue with but is common in several other states.
 The spin of what happened in Michigan from Trump Jr. and others is another example in the long line of false and misleading claims over mail-in voting. This narrative of widespread fraud in voting-by-mail -- heralded by the President -- includes patently phony claims that undocumented immigrants are sent ballots, that absentee and mail-in voting are substantially different, that foreign countries can easily interfere with the process, and much more.
 A spokesperson for Trump Jr. did not return requests for comment.
