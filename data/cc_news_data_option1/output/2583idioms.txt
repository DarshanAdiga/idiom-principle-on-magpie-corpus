BEIJING (AP) — Asian stock markets followed Wall Street higher Thursday as hopes for development of a coronavirus vaccine competed with concern about rising U.S. infections.
 Benchmarks in Shanghai, Tokyo, Hong Kong and Australia all advanced.
 Investors were encouraged after Pfizer and BioNtech announced preliminary data from a vaccine test, one of a series being carried out by global developers.
 At the same time, the populous American states of California and Texas reported daily record highs in new cases.
 “Vaccine hopes, while welcome, fall short of guaranteeing a V-shaped recovery,” said Mizuho Bank in a report.
 The Shanghai Composite Index rose 1.6% to 3,073.98 and the Nikkei 225 in Tokyo added 0.2% to 22,159.722. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong, reopening after a holiday, gained 1.6% to 24,801.28.
 In South Korea, the Kospi advanced 0.8% to 2,124.39 while Australia's S&P-ASX 200 added 1.6% to 6,030.30. India's Sensex opened up 0.9% while New Zealand, Singapore and Jakarta also rose.

George Banks is following his American dream.
 And he’s not letting a pandemic get in his way.
 Banks, who opened Tre’Vione’s (“Better Than Good”) in Hawesville last year, will reopen it Friday in Towne Square Mall.
 The New Orleans-style restaurant is in the space next to the Frederica Street entrance.
 It has a separate entrance from the mall and a patio area.
 “This was always my objective,” Banks said Wednesday. “Hawesville was a wonderful pilot place between Evansville, Owensboro and Louisville. And I had customers from all three. But most came from Owensboro.”
 He said a lot of people have worries about the mall’s future.
 But Banks said he’s impressed with the owners and their plans.
 “Ed Ray has very supportive,” he said.
 Banks said he grew up in the projects in New Orleans, but joined the U.S. Army, got two master’s degrees and decided to stay in Kentucky after he retired from the Army.
 His family scattered all over the country after Hurricane Katrina devastated his old neighborhood in 2005, he said.
 Banks’ menu of Cajun and Creole foods includes frog legs, gumbo, red beans and rice, jambalaya, fried chicken wings, etoufee, fried gator tail, crawfish, catfish and shrimp.
 But it also includes hamburgers, pork chops, mashed potatoes and other traditional dishes cooked in New Orleans style.
 Banks said Creole cooking — red beans and rice — isn’t hot, but Cajun — jambalaya — is.
 He said everything is cooked from scratch and he can adjust the spices to a customer’s taste.
 “There’s nothing like this around here,” Banks said.
 Hours will be from 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. seven days a week for the first month, he said, until he gets his liquor license.
 Then, he’ll adjust the hours.
 Banks said the coronavirus guidelines are actually helping him open.
 “When we opened in Hawesville, we had more people come in the beginning than we could handle well,” he said. “Now, we can only operate a 50% capacity and that will help with our soft opening.”
 The restaurant seats 330 normally or 165 now.
 A lot of food on the menu is seasonal, Banks said.
 Redfish, trout and crawfish all have different seasons, he said.
 Banks said one of the women who applied for a cooking job said she hadn’t cooked “foreign food,” when he mentioned the Cajun and Creole dishes.
 “Louisiana is part of America,” he said, shaking his head. “Creole and Cajun foods are American food.”
 Banks said that as a veteran he wants to honor the servicemen and women who never came back from war.
 He’ll have a “missing man” table set up in the restaurant to honor those still missing.
 And he wants help from local first responders on a way to honor them.
 “Being a black business owner, I want to reach out to the police,” Banks said. “We all have to come together. I want my son to look up to the police.”
 The restaurant has 20 on staff, but will need more when seating returns to 100% of capacity, he said.

El gobierno bonaerense debera definir en un plazo maximo de 20 dias si declara o no esencial la actividad judicial en la Provincia, tal como vienen reclamando desde los colegios de abogados, que piden la reapertura de los estudios y de los tribunales con protocolos de cuidado ante el coronavirus.
 Asi lo dispuso un fallo emitido en las ultimas horas por el Juzgado Contencioso Administrativo 1 de La Plata, a partir de un recurso de amparo presentado por el Colegio de Abogados de la Provincia para que el Ejecutivo declarara servicio esencial a la actividad.
 El planteo habia sido motorizado a principios de abril, pocos dias despues de que el gobierno dispusiera la cuarentena y la Suprema Corte de Justicia ordenada disponer una feria solo con actividad presencial del personal esencial y habilitara que la Justicia pueda funcionar a traves de medios electronicos.
 En ese planteo de los abogados, se pidio al gobernador Axel Kicillof que declarara servicio esencial y se permitiera a los abogados abrir los estudios respetando un protocolo de actuacion con medidas de cuidado y distanciamiento.
 Como ese pedido no fue contestado por el gobernador, los abogados presentaron un recurso de amparo por mora ante el Contencioso 1 de La Plata, para que desde el Juzgado se le ordene a la Provincia que responda.
 En ese plazo, el gobierno habilito el funcionamiento de estudios juridicos y juzgados de paz en el interior bonaerense, en los distritos que estan en fase 5 de la cuarentena. Pero quedo pendiente el pedido por los estudios y los juzgados del Conurbano y La Plata.
 "Se le habia solicitado al Ejecutivo provincial que exceptue de la restriccion de aislamiento a todos los abogados matriculados en la Provincia, que se implemente un protocolo que haga posible la apertura de los estudios juridicos con atenciones minimas y que se declare a la justicia como servicio esencial, asi como a la labor de los abogados", explicaron desde el Colegio de Abogados.
 Sobre el fallo del Contencioso firmado por el juez Francisco Terrier, explicaron que ahora el Ejecutivo provincial "debera dar una respuesta expresa, fundada y suficiente al reclamo efectuado por el Colegio de Abogados".
 En ese contexto, tal como informara este diario, la Suprema Corte resolvio en los ultimos dias suspender en la feria judicial de invierno de julio.
 Los jueces del maximo organo judicial bonaerense admitieron que el COVID-19, con su consecuente aislamiento social, preventivo y obligatorio, provoco "un inevitable impacto sobre el servicio de justicia".
 "Parece indudable que el estado de emergencia y la imposibilidad de afluencia regular de las personas, asi como en general las restricciones normativas que vedan la actividad presencial en las sedes tribunalicias, y en su hora hasta obstaron el ejercicio profesional de la abogacia, han causado una merma en el quehacer habitual de los organos jurisdiccionales", señala el documento que lleva las firmas del presidente de la Corte, Daniel Soria, y los jueces Luis Genoud, Eduardo de Lazzari, Hilda Kogan, Sergio Torres y Eduardo Pettigiani.

The 4th of July as well as summer in general means, among many things, fireworks may be filling the sky for all who wish to see them.      With potentially millions of people" looking up at the sky for the fireworks, they will have a chance to see the stars beyond.      While waiting for the pyrotechnics to begin, usually scheduled when it is just getting dark enough to see them well, twilight will be well underway.      If you are there for sunset, watch how the Earth's lovely star descends in a deep orange and red shade, and the deepening dusk paints the west-northwestern sky in a vivid, ever-changing palette of hues.      With the sun set, you have a clear view to the east, look low on the horizon for the moon, only one day before full phase.      See how the moon seems bigger than normal, being low on the horizon. This is actually an optical illusion.      Look also for a deep violet band of color along the east-southeast horizon. This is the edge of the Earth's dark shadow, making a low angle on the sky. After a short time, as the sky darkens, the shadow will no longer be visible.      We usually don't talk about the Earth's shadow until a time of a lunar eclipse when the moon passes through, darkening and turning a reddish shade.      The red of sunsets and sunrises and the red of a lunar eclipse are the effect of refraction. The atmosphere enveloping the spherical Earth acts like a glass lens, and bends the rays of the sun, breaking them into its component spectrum. The longer wavelengths are on the red end of the spectrum and pass through the most.      Unfortunately during July 2020, there are no bright planets in the evening sky. Otherwise, they would be among the first points of light to appear before the fireworks take our attention.      Given a clear sky, what you will see are the wondrous points of light from the sky's brightest stars above the horizon at the time.      Those who would like to make a wish on the first star you see would be following a very old tradition.      The first star to appear will be Vega, magnitude 0.1 and blue-white in shade. Look high in the eastern sky.      Next is Arcturus, magnitude 0.2 and of a wonderful yellow-orange hue. Arcturus stands high up in the south during the twilight of early July.      The next brightest star is Altair, 0.9 and white. Look to the lower right from Vega, in the east-southeast.      Antares, magnitude 1.2 and colored red, shines low in the south-southeast.      Deneb, 1.3 and white, will be to the lower left from Vega, in the east- northeastern sky.   Vega, Deneb and Altair, although in different constellations, make up the famed "Summer Triangle."      Look low in the west for Regulus, a white magnitude 1.3 star.      By the time fireworks begin, you won't likely be tracing constellations, and the bright rockets and flares will keep you fixated at the wonders a few hundred feet above your head.      When the fireworks are over and most everyone is packing up to go home, perhaps to get in line for the ritualistic traffic jam that is often part of the 4th of July tradition, take a moment to catch more stars in the moonlit sky.      Over the next couple of weeks, with the return of moonless skies, take in the glory of the universe.      Fireworks are great, but don't miss a chance to see the thousands of stars dim and bright spread over your head, and the fascinating billows of the hazy Milky Way Band that becomes so prominent as a summer evening turns towards midnight and beyond.      Learn to find the constellations, find out more star names and, with binoculars, hunt down even more treasures from star clusters to dim and very distant galaxies within your reach. The view is endless and waits to be seen!   Keep looking up at the sky!      Peter Becker is managing editor at The News Eagle in Hawley, Pennsylvania. Notes are welcome at news@neagle.com.

Moving house is a palaver at the best of times, but in the Canadian province of Quebec it is even more testing as the majority of leases end on the same day.
 Hundreds of thousands of people in the French-speaking region move on July 1, and in Montreal alone 80,000 to 100,000 households change their address around this time of year, according to official city figures.
 The tradition reportedly dates from the 18th century, when landlords were forbidden from evicting tenant farmers until all snow had cleared.
 This year moving season has been further complicated by the coronavirus epidemic sweeping Canada.
 "I was worried," said Sheila Dassin, a 46-year-old fashion designer, directing masked workers from a distance as they strained under the weight of her furniture.
 "People are going to touch your things. With the crisis outside, we are afraid of people, that strangers will bring it inside our house."
 Quebec has reported more than half of Canada's approximately 104,000 confirmed coronavirus cases and nearly two-thirds of its 8,600 deaths.
 The lease-date quirk -- most end on June 30 -- coincides with Canada Day, a national holiday on July 1, which gives Quebec residents some spare time to complete their moves.

But given the fraught situation this year, more people than usual feared they would be made homeless by a housing shortage compounded by the ongoing health crisis.
 "The number of calls for help exploded," said Veronique Laflamme, spokeswoman for housing rights group FRAPRU.
 She said 171 households had found themselves without a lease this year in Montreal, compared with 98 in 2019.
 To help stop the spread of COVID-19, authorities recommended that people not ask friends and neighbors for help with their move, but instead use a moving company, because they are able to take health precautions.
 "It's an additional expense, which piles on for households already struggling to make ends meet," Laflamme said.
 \- Stress and anxiousness -
 Moving furniture makes it "completely impossible to keep a distance of two meters" (six feet), said Pierre-Olivier Cyr, whose company, The Moving Clan, has implemented a number of new safety measures.
 Among them is a rule allowing only one customer in the home at a time to minimize contact with the moving team.
 Since March the company, which owns around 60 trucks, has been disinfecting its fleet every night and has purchased around 10,000 reusable masks.
 Implementing new safety measures cost the firm an estimated CAN$100,000 (US$73,600), which it so far has not passed on to customers.
 "People have lost their jobs, the means are not there," Cyr said, adding that he doesn't rule out an increase "if the pandemic were to stretch on."
 Maxime Villemure, CEO of Spaceful, a Montreal moving start-up, said that "customers are still quite stressed. They ask us questions about the hygiene measures we're taking. We sense anxiousness."

Wanneer we vragen of het boeiende tijden zijn voor mensen die onderzoek doen rond onderwijs, antwoordt professor Van Keer enigszins afwijzend: 'Het is een groot experiment, maar als we dergelijke experimenten zouden willen doen, zouden ze niet door de ethische commissie geraken. Als ik te kiezen had, dan had ik toch voor een ander experiment gekozen.' Bovendien is zo goed als alle lopend onderzoek stopgezet door de coronacrisis.Van Keer vindt het wel boeiend om na te denken over de impact van het afstandsonderwijs en waar scholen prioriteit aan moeten geven op 1 september. De professor vindt overigens dat scholen en leerkrachten niet terug naar de situatie van voor de coronacrisis moeten teruggrijpen.'Nu was het behelpen, omdat iedereen op snelheid is gepakt. Maar de ervaringen leren en onderzoek tonen aan dat een combinatie - wat in de literatuur vaak blended learning wordt genoemd - het beste werkt.

 When the fireworks are over and most everyone is packing up to go home, perhaps to get in line for the ritualistic traffic jam that is often part of the 4th of July tradition, take a moment to catch more stars in the moonlit sky.
 Over the next couple of weeks, with the return of moonless skies, take in the glory of the universe.
 Fireworks are great, but don't miss a chance to see the thousands of stars dim and bright spread over your head, and the fascinating billows of the hazy Milky Way Band that becomes so prominent as a summer evening turns towards midnight and beyond.
 Learn to find the constellations, find out more star names and, with binoculars, hunt down even more treasures from star clusters to dim and very distant galaxies within your reach. The view is endless and waits to be seen!   Keep looking up at the sky!

“Alan Trejo still calls me Grandpa,” he said. “We went to see him in Lancaster (California) two years ago. We showed up there and are chatting and a lady comes out of the dugout. He says, ‘Come over here, I want you to meet my grandparents.’ ... I don’t remember exactly what she said, but she was wondering how we were his grandparents. We told her he was hosted by our daughter his first year and we were his adopted grandparents. ‘Oh, OK.’
 “At that point she opened up the stadium to us. They gave us seats every game, we didn’t buy a seat. If they weren’t in the shade and my wife couldn’t handle it, she got us moved. We were like the king and queen. We weren’t anybody.”

Mr. Ruddy is survived by his beloved wife of 54 years, Colleen (Murray), his son Philip C. Ruddy Jr. (wife Ana) of Glendale, California, his daughter Erin Ruddy Sabey (husband Andrew) of Lafayette, California, and his grandchildren Julia Colleen Sabey, Reed Andrew Sabey and Benjamin Oak Ruddy. He is also survived by his sister Mary Margaret Ruddy Zumoff (husband Robert) of Tempe, Arizona and his brother C. John Ruddy (wife Lorna) of Aurora.
 Mr. Ruddy’s gregarious “joie de vivre” was renowned and exemplified through his love of family, friends, food, wine, film, art, philosophy, history, fresh flowers, and classical, blues, and rock and roll music. He also loved to travel, including many trips to Southern France and Northern Italy, as well as Mexico, Greece, and his ancestral home of Ireland. He never missed a sunset if he could help it, preferably on a beach, with his wife at his side and a glass of wine in his hand.
 Even as his illness progressed, Mr. Ruddy never stopped sharing his enthusiasm and appreciation for all that life has to offer – a sentiment that was echoed time and again, by the kind words he received from family and friends around the world, whose lives he touched in ways both big and small. In his honor, we invite you to embrace life, take time to enjoy every moment, the sun, the sky, the flowers – and toast every sunset, for the days we are gifted.

A decade after being banned amid concerns about wildfires and groundwater pollution, and despite protests by Native Americans and recommendations from public health officials to avoid public gatherings, fireworks will once again be exploding over Mount Rushmore in the Black Hills of western South Dakota on Friday, anticipating July 4.      President Trump has pushed for the revival of the pyrotechnics display, and he plans to witness the spectacle before 60-foot-tall visages of Presidents Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln, and Theodore Roosevelt carved across the granite face of the Mount Rushmore National Memorial.  
 About 7,500 other spectators will be there too, the winners of an online ticket lottery sponsored by South Dakota's state tourism department.      And despite at least 91 deaths registered in South Dakota from COVID-19, these visitors will not be told to don face masks or to practice social distancing at the event.      "We will have a large event July 3rd; we told those folks that have concerns that they can stay home," South Dakota Republican Gov. Kristi Noem told Fox News host Laura Ingraham on Monday. "But [for] those who want to come and join us, we'll be giving out free face masks if they choose to wear one, but we won't be social distancing."      Noem, who became governor last year after serving eight years in the House of Representatives, has refused to order restrictions to protect public health throughout the pandemic.

The Wukong will often then split into a side lane with Teleport and act as a 1-3-1 or flank threat in the mid-game. With his passive, he can take duels with most enemies. His Teleport allows him to get into fights quickly if needed to help initiate or flank.
 Items wise, "feasting Wukong" builds the same as top lane. Trinity Force and Death's Dance are must buys. After that, it's pretty open. Sterak's Gage, Black Cleaver, and Edge of Night are popular. As long as you take Conqueror, you're sitting pretty.
 Riot Games Fasting Senna is still a thing.
 As for the Senna half, she plays like a typical Fasting Senna. She goes around farming souls, laying down vision, building utility items with a bit of damage intertwined. Some Senna's have been running Grasp of the Undying over Glacial Augment, then opting into Frozen Mallet first to have extra tankiness. This is the most popular build right now, and it scales nicely into late.
 If an opportunistic fight pops up, Senna Wukong can usually capitalize on it in lane or across the map. They have good burst damage, and as the fight drags on, Wukong only gets stronger. If there's no peel to stop the Wukong, he will tear through the backline.
 ## What other "feasting" champions are on the rise with "Fasting Senna"?
 Fasting Senna originally got its start back in February with supports like Tahm Kench, Nautilus, and Galio. These champions would do incredibly well with the early gold influx, hitting core item power spikes like Stoneplate early.
 However, the strategy has now morphed into something where the "feasting" champion can side lane in the mid-game to not only get a gold lead, but an experience lead too. While this may just sound like Senna support but the AD carries playing it, it's still got that interesting dichotomy in the bot lane the marksman provides.

The roar is back at New York's Thunder Road.
 Three months after its opening day was canceled by the coronavirus pandemic, Watkins Glen International is hosting car clubs again as NASCAR weekend looms in mid-August.
 “Everybody is excited about getting back in the saddle. I know we are," track president Michael Printup said. "We had some people on furlough and we were able to bring back almost every single person, so that’s good. It’s good to get the activity going, get the track hot.”
 Car clubs returned to The Glen two weeks ago and Printup expects the car club schedule will quickly be booked through Nov. 1.
 And that would be a very good thing.
 “It’s been pretty quiet," Printup said. “When you think about car clubs, we turn those track rentals three times a week. You’re changing 150 to 400 drivers a week that are driving the economy and this community. It’s sorely missed.”
 WGI is a major economic driver in the Finger Lakes region of upstate New York. NASCAR weekend has sold out five straight times. Attendance figures are not released by the stock car organization, but local officials peg it at over 90,000 annually since 2015. Judy McKinney Cherry, executive director of the local Partnership for Economic Development, figures the track's economic impact is at least $275 million annually, based on the most recent study.
 Printup figures that number might be down as much as 75% this year. "It’s a pretty big number,” he said.

Geoff sadly passed on Friday, June 19, 2020 at the Toronto Western Hospital at the age of 80 years following a massive stroke. Beloved husband and best friend to his wife of 57 years, Valerie. Loving father of Carl (Theresa) and Andrea. Proud Poppa of Bryn, Alannah, Shannon, Madison and Carly. Predeceased by his sister Janet and brother-in-law John. Dear uncle of Heath and Julie Newsome, Howard and Claire Newsome, Jennie and Rob Foster, John and Sue Daniels, Kevin and Deb Daniels, Gordon Daniels, Warren and Savannah Dillon, Bev and Mike Barber, Donna and Dave Lucas, Dean Fox, Dwight and Debbie Rutherford. Geoff will be greatly missed by extended family members and many dear friends. Geoff was born in Scarborough England and started his working life as a tool and die maker in the UK. After marrying the love of his life Val and seeing the birth of son Carl, the adventurous young family set off for the US. Once there, the family worked and travelled across the US including Arizona where daughter Andrea completed the perfect family. The family returned to the UK for a short while before emigrating to Canada in 1971 where they settled, and Geoff spent the rest of his working career in automotive engineering and raising his family. Geoff and Val frequently travelled to Australia and Florida to visit Carl, Andrea and the grandchildren. Known for his huge heart, selflessness and generous spirit, Geoff was always willing to lend a hand to family and friends in need. He worked hard his entire life and everything he did was for his family and wanting the best for them. A truly wonderful husband, father, grandfather and friend to so many. Valerie and Geoff were truly joined at the hip, seldom apart and did everything together. By far his biggest accomplishments were the lives he touched. His commitment to family and friends is evident by all those that love him. Geoff was never at a loss for words, he knew something about everything. He enjoyed a good autobiography, discussing world affairs over a cup of coffee. He shared his wisdom and laughter, always had a joke to share or silly story and funny faces for his grandchildren to enjoy. Geoff had an artistic flair which showed in everything he did, from endless hours spent in the garden to home renovations which he took great pride in (well deserved). The list of things he still wanted to do was endless and as he said he wanted to "stick around". Sadly, he will not get to see his latest renovation fully completed but his spirit will live on within all of us. In keeping with Geoff's wishes, cremation has taken place. Due to COVID19 restrictions, a private celebration of life will be held at the Steckley-Gooderham Funeral Home, 30 Worsley St., Barrie. Livestream access to the service will be available to the public on Saturday, July 4th, 2020 at 1 p.m., with a link provided on the Steckley-Gooderham website. If desired, donations in Geoff's memory may be made to the Heart and Stroke Foundation Canada and are greatly appreciated by the family.

Susan McCrobie, Kentucky Division of the United Daughters of the Confederacy president, applauded Daviess Fiscal Court’s decision to delay its vote on removing the Confederate statue from the grounds of the Daviess County Courthouse.
 On Tuesday, members of the court were expected to vote on a resolution regarding the Confederate monument that would have returned the Confederate statue to the DOC, and moved it to property south of Panther Creek on U.S. 431 owned by the chapter.
 Instead, Commissioner George Wathen presented a surprise motion that would see the court postpone the vote until Aug. 6. Commissioners Charlie Castlen and Mike Koger followed suit with Wathen, with Daviess County Judge-Executive Al Mattingly voting against delay.
 For McCrobie, the decision to delay was the right move, especially given that she would like to see the statue remain in public view, she said.
 “I’m glad that they delayed the vote,” she said. “It gives the citizens a chance to be heard. If they vote to remove it from that site, then we have an agreement to relocate it to another site. Our division has one general convention each year in October and in all honesty, I think our whole division needs a say on it, and we need to decide as a group on what we want to accomplish.”
 McCrobie disagrees with the assertion that the monuments hold any racist overtones.
 “We have the same mission that we have had for 123 years,” she said. “It was to take care of the soldiers as they came home and educate and provide for the orphans. Many of those soldiers didn’t have graves that were marked and that is why many of these monuments were erected; they were tributes and memorials in honor of those that fought for the Southland during the federal government’s invasion. The idea that they signify white supremacy is not truthful; it isn’t a truthful statement. During that time, these women couldn’t impact laws and couldn’t vote and many didn’t have jobs outside of the home; these monuments were strictly meant to be memorials. I would like to see it remain in public view. I am disappointed in how things are handled in today’s time. The biggest is communication. I am disappointed in the people bringing that grievance to the court and not bringing us into that dialogue. When you don’t get all parties, there is no expectation of a real settlement.”
 Mattngly has worked in recent weeks with members of the community led by the Rev. Rhondalyn Randolph, president of the Owensboro NAACP Branch 3107, who would like to see the statue removed as well as the DOC to find a suitable solution.
 However, according to emails obtained by the Messenger-Inquirer through open records requests, no matter the resolution, McCrobie doesn’t believe that the NAACP should have a say in the statue’s fate, according to the email sent on June 25.
 “I understand from second-hand information that the Owensboro NAACP intends to hold some type of outdoor rally in the next few days to tell the good people of Daviess County the history behind our monument,” McCrobie wrote. The Owensboro NAACP has no standing to do so as the monument was not an idea brought to fruition by their organization and they do not hold any records as to the history behind the monument to enlighten the assembled and as they have not contacted me as the official spokesperson for owners of the monument. I can only say that their intentions have been somewhat ill conceived and problematic. Furthermore, any opinions they have as to what is proper placement of our memorial monument as noted on Resolution 18-2020 is not any matter we wish to entertain as they have no standing to do so.”
 For Randolph, despite hopes that the community outcry for the removal of the statue would be heard by the court, she did not expect the process to be “smooth,” she said.
 ”In my heart and mind, I knew something like this would happen,” she said. “From what I can gather, we are almost there. I know that there are people working to resolve the issue. Their point of contention is where it is going to be located which brings me to question what is the problem with the property that was initially proposed, is it removing it from a place of prominence? The proposed location flows into the narrative, and it would be a fitting location for what was happening in history at that time, which is why there was no argument from me when it was presented.”
 Randolph fears that the intent of the DOC is to place the statue in a place of prominence that continues the “glorification of the Confederate cause,” she said.
 ”In my heart, it would be in the museum where it could build on a larger narrative about Owensboro history,” she said. “If their intent is to place it in an area of prominence, will they be able to keep it within the historical narrative or will it allow them to further glorify or promote the Confederate cause without giving an actual account of what they stood for? That is my fear. It shapes attitudes about how people feel about other people and what they think because that propaganda and legacy was white supremacy and racism. They were pushing for others to be second-class citizens and generations were taught this. In our coalition to remove the statue, we have people from all walks of life working to move our community forward. There are others that have been taught the narrative of hate through the propaganda that was pushed by groups like the Daughters of the Confederacy and the KKK that create an atmosphere of oppression. We will continue to make our voices heard and will work to have the statue taken off of public property because it is inappropriate for it to be there.”
 As far as the court’s ultimate decision and how they will move forward, it is in the court of the commissioners, Mattingly said.
 ”I will reiterate how disappointed I was,” he said. “How long is enough time? I know Commissioner Wathen was disappointed when we spent two and a half months officially discussing the fairness ordinance. When it was implied that this issue only had a week, I don’t know where the commissioners have been, but this issue has been going on since 2012. That is plenty of time to make a decision. Delaying will not change the minds on either side. I would love to put the issue on the ballot, but our constitution forbids that. As I said, it is in their court and I await for them to tell me how they want this resolved. I presented my best efforts. While Mrs. McCrobie doesn’t think that African Americans in this community have a right to voice their opinion, in fact, they have as much right as anybody else.”

Cuatro hombres. Uno encima de otro. Y en la cima, la bola del mundo. Doce metros. Asi es la escultura diseñada por Ramon Conde que rinde homenaje a los Hermanos de la Lejia. Cuatro de los ocho eran militantes socialistas y tres fueron ejecutados en el Campo da Rata en los primeros meses de la Guerra Civil. El que consiguio escapar, Pepin, el primogenito, emigro. Quiza muchos ya no recuerden esta historia, pero la hija menor de aquel superviviente, Selva Garcia Pomes, quiere mantener vivo el espiritu de su familia y que A Coruña no la olvide. A sus 80 años, encargo la escultura a Conde y la acaba de donar a la ciudad. Estara hecha en nueve meses y solo queda buscarle un sitio para que los Hermanos de la Lejia, que se les llamaba asi debido al producto de cuya fabricacion vivia la familia, esten presentes.
 El telefono del escultor Ramon Conde, autor de obras como los _Redeiros_ de Vigo o el _Guardi an_ de la Torre de Hercules, sono hace tres años. Al otro lado se encontraba Selva Garcia. "Me contacto ella y me hablo del proyecto que tenia para homenajear a su familia. Me explico sus sentimientos sobre el tema", recuerda. En aquella conversacion, la hija de Pepin, nacida en el exilio, le hablo de su padre y de sus tios y de las "experiencias negras que tuvieron que vivir durante la guerra".
 Selva Garcia se enamoro de la obra del escultor gallego, al que propuso este encargo. "Me dijo que le gustaba la manera en que trabajo, mi obra artistica. Ya conocia algun monumento y coincidia con la imagen que ella queria dar, ya que no buscaba una obra puramente alegorica. Le gusto esa vertiente figurativo-expresionista y el realismo", detalla Conde.
 Compartieron charlas a distancia, pero tuvieron la oportunidad de conocerse en persona en uno de los viajes de la hija de Pepin a A Coruña. El primero fue en agosto de 2018, cuando contaba 78 años. "He venido a la ciudad a hacer un monumento importante aqui, en honor a mi padre y a mis tios, o al soldado republicano español, que esta tan olvidado. Tambien quiero comprar una casa y convertirla en centro cultural. En vez de que mis padres me den un legado a mi, se lo doy yo a ellos", contaba entonces Selva Garcia en un memorial en Guitiriz organizado por la Irmandade Manuel Maria, Riazor Blues y Xermolos.
 Poco a poco, y con muchos sentimientos de por medio, Ramon Conde empezo a crear una escultura dedicada a Bebel, Jaures, France y Pepin, pero que tambien sirve como "homenaje a las ideas por las que ellos lucharon".
 El mundo, que aguanta uno de los hermanos sobre sus hombros, habla tambien de la "trascendencia que tuvo la familia en America", a donde escapo de una España en guerra. "Las revoluciones ideologicas terminan siendo mundiales, transmitiendo cosas de una manera que no puedes prever. Queria hacer un pequeño guiño hacia esa emigracion que tuvieron que realizar", explica el escultor.
 Esa historia no quedara en el olvido. Ira grabada en el pie de la escultura, de dos metros de alto. "Como una pequeña explicacion", aporta Conde. La ubicacion todavia es una incognita, aunque lo mas probable es que se instale por la zona de Os Rosales. La Junta de Gobierno Local ya ha aprobado la donacion de la obra, que planea colocar en alguna de las rotondas disponibles que hay en la ciudad, como la que se encuentra en San Roque de Fora, entre la avenida Gerardo Porto y la Travesia de Os Rosales, una vez pasado el Millennium. "Lo logico es que cuando se dona una obra de este tipo, se busque su ubicacion segun la disponibilidad del Concello. Lo unico que quiere Selva es que figure dentro de la ciudad", desvela el escultor, que reconoce que "no conocia a esta familia ni su semblanza", pero ha conseguido entender el sentimiento a traves de las historias de la hija de Pepin.

Other than trying to make hay out of a Twitter endorsement from President Donald Trump, Tipton did little campaigning. In fact, he hasn’t done much of the way of campaigning, particularly in Republican counties, for some years now, several observers say.
 “I’m surprised that Tipton didn’t put up much of a fight,” said longtime Republican JJ Fletcher, who ran a failed write-in campaign for the GOP nomination for Mesa County commissioner against Janet Rowland, who endorsed Boebert in the race.
 “I don’t think he put a lot of effort into this campaign, obviously,” Fletcher added. “I haven’t actually seen him have any meet-and-greets or actual events in Mesa County, not in years.”
 Though it doesn’t constitute an endorsement, at least not yet, Trump sent a congratulatory Tweet to Boebert late Tuesday, saying “Congratulations on a really great win!”

He may have lost by 10 percentage points and nearly 10,000 votes in Tuesday’s GOP primary, but U.S. Rep. Scott Tipton won 19 of the 29 counties in the expansive 3rd Congressional District, a seat he’s held for a decade.
 The remaining 10 counties, however, are what put his upstart rival, Rifle restaurant owner Lauren Boebert, over the top.
 In the five most populated counties in the district, Boebert led in all and by wide margins. Republican and unaffiliated voters in three of those counties — Mesa, Montrose and Delta — went for Boebert by more than 60%.

Teen held in shooting death of stepdad
 STEAMBOAT SPRINGS — Authorities say a teenager shot and killed his stepfather as the man fought with the boy’s mother during a camping trip in northern Colorado.
 Routt County Sheriff Garrett Wiggins says the 14-year-old boy shot his 57-year-old stepfather in the back with a .22-caliber rifle in the Buffalo Pass area Saturday night.
 Investigators say nearby campers told them the mother and stepfather had been arguing all afternoon and appeared to have been drinking. According to law enforcement reports, the mother was trying to leave the campsite with her son to go to Steamboat Springs when the man pushed her to the ground and got on top of her.

Diane Schwenke, president and chief executive officer of the Grand Junction Area Chamber of Commerce, predicted earlier Wednesday that the ruling would make it difficult for the setback measure, and others including one dealing with family medical leave. The chamber was part of a business coalition that filed a court brief supporting the court challenge of the Polis order.
 “We felt like the constitution of the state is pretty clear in terms of how you have to gather signatures,” she said. “… Our main concern was upholding the integrity of the process of gathering signatures.”
 The Governor’s Office said in a statement that it doesn’t believe “outdated process rules should interfere with Coloradans’ right to petition.”
 Polis said in a release from his office, “While (Wednesday’s) decision is a blow to the power of the people of our state to petition, it is certainly convenient for certain groups or elected leaders that they have to deal with fewer ballot initiatives. It makes my life easier as Governor that there will be fewer curveballs coming our way, but sadly it’s at the cost of making it much harder and even dangerous from a public health perspective for activists on all sides to get their issues on the ballot for voters to decide.”

Geoff sadly passed on Friday, June 19, 2020 at the Toronto Western Hospital at the age of 80 years following a massive stroke. Beloved husband and best friend to his wife of 57 years, Valerie. Loving father of Carl (Theresa) and Andrea. Proud Poppa of Bryn, Alannah, Shannon, Madison and Carly. Predeceased by his sister Janet and brother-in-law John. Dear uncle of Heath and Julie Newsome, Howard and Claire Newsome, Jennie and Rob Foster, John and Sue Daniels, Kevin and Deb Daniels, Gordon Daniels, Warren and Savannah Dillon, Bev and Mike Barber, Donna and Dave Lucas, Dean Fox, Dwight and Debbie Rutherford. Geoff will be greatly missed by extended family members and many dear friends. Geoff was born in Scarborough England and started his working life as a tool and die maker in the UK. After marrying the love of his life Val and seeing the birth of son Carl, the adventurous young family set off for the US. Once there, the family worked and travelled across the US including Arizona where daughter Andrea completed the perfect family. The family returned to the UK for a short while before emigrating to Canada in 1971 where they settled, and Geoff spent the rest of his working career in automotive engineering and raising his family. Geoff and Val frequently travelled to Australia and Florida to visit Carl, Andrea and the grandchildren. Known for his huge heart, selflessness and generous spirit, Geoff was always willing to lend a hand to family and friends in need. He worked hard his entire life and everything he did was for his family and wanting the best for them. A truly wonderful husband, father, grandfather and friend to so many. Valerie and Geoff were truly joined at the hip, seldom apart and did everything together. By far his biggest accomplishments were the lives he touched. His commitment to family and friends is evident by all those that love him. Geoff was never at a loss for words, he knew something about everything. He enjoyed a good autobiography, discussing world affairs over a cup of coffee. He shared his wisdom and laughter, always had a joke to share or silly story and funny faces for his grandchildren to enjoy. Geoff had an artistic flair which showed in everything he did, from endless hours spent in the garden to home renovations which he took great pride in (well deserved). The list of things he still wanted to do was endless and as he said he wanted to "stick around". Sadly, he will not get to see his latest renovation fully completed but his spirit will live on within all of us. In keeping with Geoff's wishes, cremation has taken place. Due to COVID19 restrictions, a private celebration of life will be held at the Steckley-Gooderham Funeral Home, 30 Worsley St., Barrie. Livestream access to the service will be available to the public on Saturday, July 4th, 2020 at 1 p.m., with a link provided on the Steckley-Gooderham website. If desired, donations in Geoff's memory may be made to the Heart and Stroke Foundation Canada and are greatly appreciated by the family. Online memories and condolences may be forwarded via www.steckleygooderham.com

Colorado voters defeated a 2,500-foot drilling setback measure in 2018.
 Chelsie Miera, executive director of the West Slope Colorado Oil and Gas Association, said she thinks the high-court ruling greatly hindered the ability of Safe & Healthy Colorado to get its measure on the ballot this year, and of a lot of initiatives to make the ballot. She said that’s not a bad thing, given the need to be thoughtful and careful when it comes to statutory and constitutional amendments.
 She said changes in how signature-gathering occurs, with checks and balances resulting in an effective, transparent process, might be possible in the future, but not in a short period of time as was the case for the Polis action.
 “To put something together in a matter of weeks that has long-lasting implications to Coloradans is scary, and for that I do think the Supreme Court made the right choice,” she said.

BYRAM -- Tomahawk Lake Waterpark will not be among the popular summer destinations opening statewide Thursday or any time this year, announced management.
   
 The park, as well as other similar warm-weather attractions in the state, has not been open yet this season due to the novel coronavirus pandemic.
   
 Gov. Phil Murphy on June 23 said amusement parks and water parks could reopen Thursday at 50% capacity as a result of the significant decrease in state COVID-19 cases. But Tomahawk Lake won't be joining nearby attractions Mountain Creek Waterpark and Land of Make of Believe in reopening, attributing the decision to safety concerns and a short time frame to plan for the new precautions.
   
 "With the delayed notice from the governor and lack of time to best service our guests in the manner they are accustomed to, we are taking this season to revitalize the park and create a more safe and memorable experience for next year," reads the park's Facebook page.
   
 Tomahawk Lake had planned for an abbreviated 2020 season prior to its announcement on Saturday. On June 21 the park posted on Facebook that it was still waiting for guidance from Murphy and local authorities regarding reopening.
   
 In business for nearly 70 years, Tomahawk Lake Waterpark attracts visitors to Sussex County on day trips to enjoy the numerous activities on the property. Aside from swimming and boating in the 20-acre lake, the park offers water rides for adults and children as well as miniature golf, horseshoes, volleyball and a picnic area, among other features.
   
 The social media post also reads that Tomahawk Lake will reopen "better than ever" next year and is accepting reservations for picnics.
   
 To book a picnic for 2021, call 973-478-7490 or email tomahawklakesales12@yahoo.com.

In _The Study on Brahmaputra: The Lifeline of the People of Assam_ (2016), Begum talks about several such song traditions, inspired by the moods of the river. “In this context, the names of Laksminath Bezbaruah, Jyotiprasad Agarwala, Bhupen Hazarika are noteworthy," she writes.

The City of Lodi had planned to reopen its offices, along with Lodi Lake Beach and a few other parks facilities, but those reopenings will now be delayed, city spokesman Jeff Hood said. City council meetings may also return to an online format.
 Newsom has asked cities to postpone or cancel their fireworks shows for the Fourth of July, which Lodi and Galt had already done, Hood said.
 “Hopefully we can provide a fireworks show to the public later this year,” he said — perhaps as a celebration once the pandemic eases.
 Though indoor business is off the table for at least a few weeks, the Lodi Chamber has been working behind the scenes to create a Safety & Cleanliness Pledge campaign. The program encourages local businesses to follow health and safety guidelines issued by the state and county, as well as giving local residents who are at risk of complications from COVID-19 a resource for finding safe places to do their shopping and other errands.
 One woman who spoke to Patrick recently told him that she’d gone to a store, only to see that few of the employees or other customers were wearing masks and hand sanitizer was not available. Since she is in a high-risk group and her husband is a cancer survivor, she simply turned and walked out, she told Patrick.
 “We want to get it across to businesses that there are a lot of people out there like her,” he said.
 Any business can take the pledge, not just members of the Lodi District Chamber of Commerce. Those who do promise to abide by state and local health and safety recommendations and guidelines will be included in the listing the chamber is putting together.
 For more information or to sign up, visit www.lodichamber.com and click on "Take the Pledge."
 However, one Lodi business has decided waiting out the pandemic is just not in the cards.
 After 18 years in Downtown Lodi, Rosewood Bar & Grill will close permanently.
 “With the uncertainty of what the future holds, it is time to close this chapter,” managing member Russ Munson said in a press release on Wednesday.
 In addition to the indoor business ban, the state is working with tribal governments throughout California on shutting down or modifying casino operations, and has closed parking lots at a number of state beaches and state parks through the July 4 weekend.
 “If we want to be independent from COVID-19, we have to be much more vigilant in terms of maintaining our physical distancing from others,” Newsom said.
 He asked Californians to avoid large crowds and gatherings, and be careful to wear masks to reduce the spread. The state will be taking steps to mitigate large gatherings, he said.
 “I deeply respect people’s liberty, their desire to go back to the way things once were, but I cannot impress upon you more, our actions have an impact on other people,” he said.
 San Joaquin County has seen a sharp spike in cases since June 10. That day, the county had reported a total of 1,195 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with 55 cases in Lodi.
 On Wednesday, the county had recorded a total of 3,914 confirmed cases, with more than 1,400 cases from the past 14 days alone. More than 200 of those new cases were in the two Lodi ZIP codes.
 A total of 142 people were hospitalized throughout the county with confirmed COVID-19 on Wednesday. In order to be removed from the monitoring list, the county must have no more than 20 patients in the hospital at one time, and 190 or fewer new cases over a 14-day period.
 On June 10, Sacramento County reported 1,624 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with 20 in Galt. On Wednesday, that county had 3,397 total cases, with 123 in Galt.
 The other counties included in the order are Contra Costa, Fresno, Glenn, Imperial, Kern, Kings, Los Angeles, Merced, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, Santa Barbara, Santa Clara, Solano, Stanislaus, Tulare and Ventura.
