 Once travelers depart their planes, they will be required to self-quarantine for five days and present a second negative test before being permitted to freely roam the tropical paradise.
 Government officials in the Cayman Islands announced there is no hard cap on the number of visitors allowed on the island at any one time, saying the there are several factors to consider, including “the number of people who leave on repatriation flights.”
 The British territory is also following the rise of coronavirus outbreaks in certain countries and is monitoring the global pandemic. The situation has been described as fluid, and officials will do what’s best for its residents' health and safety.
 “Safety and security will remain the main drivers in decision making,” Kirkconnell continued. “We prefer to err on the side of caution.”
 As the Cayman Islands begin preparations to reopen, the Prime Minister of The Bahamas announced Sunday the country would close its borders to international commercial flights and vessels carrying passengers from the United States due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.

Este compromiso también integra la aceleración de los proyectos de iniciativa privada y público-privada, que se verán representados en puertos, aeropuertos, plantas de tratamiento de agua, autopistas de cuarta y quinta generación, al igual que el impulso indeclinable a expandir con velocidad la construcción de vías terciarias, con la mayor inversión en años, que nos asegure más de $1,5 billones para la integración territorial y la puesta en marcha, por supuesto, del Plan Bicentenario”.

Typically, Lukovic prefers to set up her own educational trips.
 “A well-crafted educational trip can have immeasurable value in that one gets to experience a vast number of cities, hotels and activities,” she said. “Many times, I want to take a deeper dive into the locations I visit to have a [fuller] experience, which is why I plan my own.”
 Claire Schoeder of Elevations Travel, a Signature Travel Network agency, is of a similar mind.
 “Fams are beneficial, as I get experience with hotels and destinations – but only if [they] are small in size and focused on a small number of hotels/resorts. The least beneficial to me are fams where I see three hotels a day with no time to experience a property,” she said. “I am looking for the experience for my client, and that means time to really see a property – not just a quick run-through seeing some rooms and public spaces before heading on to the next stop.”
 In the final analysis, knowledge is power. “Personal knowledge and familiarity with a destination and the whole travel experience – or any product one is marketing – are invaluable,” said Ben Gritzewsky of FROSCH.

A place in the Premier League is up for grabs on Wednesday, with three teams in the chase for the second automatic promotion spot from the Championship on the final day of the second-tier season.
 Leeds United have already secured a return to the top flight after a 16-year absence. But West Bromwich Albion, Brentford and Fulham all have a chance of grabbing the runners-up spot and the lucrative prize it brings.
 The third promotion place is decided via a four-team playoff, with those slots also to be finalised by Wednesday's action. Adding to the drama, all three relegation places have yet to be confirmed with Hull City, a Premier League club three years ago, currently bottom. West Brom are favourites to be holding a socially distanced promotion party, with Slaven Bilic's side currently occupying second place.
 The Baggies know that victory at home to 14th-placed Queens Park Rangers will guarantee them a return to the elite after a two-year absence. But if the West Midlands side slip up, then the door is open for one of the two London clubs to sneak in on the final day. Brentford would be back in the top flight for the first time since 1947 if they beat Barnsley at home and West Brom fail to win.
 Should neither West Brom nor Brentford win then Fulham, who dropped out of the Premier League last season, would be back if they can win at Wigan Athletic. The consolation for the two teams that miss out on Wednesday will be a second chance via the playoff. Nottingham Forest and Cardiff City are currently fifth and sixth but must win on Wednesday to make sure of their place in the two- legged playoff semi-final, and potentially the final itself at Wembley on July 29.
 Seventh-placed Swansea are lingering and still in with a slim chance of making it. A win for the Swans at Reading would only be enough if Cardiff lose at home to bottom club Hull. Fifth-placed Forest, who are at home to Stoke, have the best goal difference but will be keen to get at least a point to make sure of their place.
 Two-times European Cup winners Forest have not been in the top flight since 1999. Seven teams still have a mathematical chance of being relegated. Barnsley and Luton are currently in the drop-zone along with Hull, while Charlton Athletic, Birmingham City, Middlesbrough and Huddersfield are still not safe. Only three points separate 22nd-placed Luton from Huddersfield in 18th.
