PEORIA -- A fatal accident that killed four women early Sunday morning started with a back and forth on whose car was faster.
   
 That's what a Peoria County prosecutor said during the bond hearing of Jerome C. Polnitz, 42, who faces up to 12 years in prison if convicted on the single count of aggravated street racing. Probation is an option as well.
   
 The charge alleges he was racing the other car in the 3400 block of Southwest Washington Street when the accident happened.
   
 The charge is a special type of class 4 felony that carries an enhanced sentence. His bond was set at $75,000 and an Oct. 29 preliminary hearing was scheduled.
   
 The women were all graduates of Manual High School: Jazzman Burns, 22, a 2016 graduate; Quanylan Thomas, 19, a 2019 graduate; and 18-year-olds Tyesha Thomas and Diamond Williams, both 2020 grads.
   
 Assistant State's Attorney Jason Ramos said that after the accident, police were able to find footage from businesses along that stretch of Washington that showed Polnitz in a Dodge Charger racing the other car, a Chevrolet Camaro.
   
 According to Peoria police, both vehicles were traveling at a high rate of speed southbound on Washington Street when the vehicle occupied by the four women lost control and crashed into a tree, resulting in the death of all four occupants.
   
 Ramos said Polnitz told police he and the women were stopped at a light when they were discussing whose car was faster.
   
 Polnitz reportedly "smashed the gas," and took off, the prosecutor said in open court. He told police that he looked back in his rear view mirror, saw the other car spinning, got scared and fled the scene.
   
 Police do not believe there was any contact between the two vehicles.
   
 Polnitz, of 1322 W. Maywood Ave., was arrested Wednesday after he went to the police station for questioning.
   
 According to Peoria County court records, he had more than 90 traffic cases since 2001. Many of them are multiple tickets from a single incident, but there are at least 20 instances of being cited for driving on a suspended license, Ramos said in court. That was also among the charges on which Polnitz was initially booked Wednesday.
   
 One of those previous instances was a 2019 case where he pleaded to three counts of driving on a suspended license. In that case, the judge fined Polnitz $75 and sentenced him to 300 days in jail with 240 of them being held in remission.
   
 He was to complete 20 public service hours and give a speech to a group on why having so many suspended-license tickets had affected his life.

For travel within the county, Forsyth is crafting its first public transportation master plan. Eric Bosman with consultants Kimley-Horn outlined the goals of the blueprint and the current state of public transportation. Bosman said around 16 percent of residents are 65 years or older, do not have a vehicle or have disabilities that necessitate public transportation.
 The greatest need for public transport centers around Cumming and along Forsyth’s border with Fulton County, he said.
 Forsyth is already behind in offering residents public mobility. Dial-a-Ride, a ride-share program that provides transportation within the county for around $2 per trip, supplied around 23,000 trips last year, but Bosman said the demand required the county partner with Uber and Lyft to meet all requests. Senior Services transportation is also available for residents and will be consolidated with Dial-a-Ride in the master plan.
 Long-term relief could include high-capacity transit, like fixed route buses, that would coincide with Ga. 400 improvements, Bosman said. However, the county is currently focusing on providing more “micro-transit” and ride request services to address the gap in coverage.
 Additional public input meetings will take place next spring for the transportation master plan.
 ATL Executive Director Chris Tomlinson said to improve the state of movement in the county and surrounding region, a focus must be placed on providing several modes of transportation.
 “It is going to take every mode of transportation to address the needs of Forsyth County,” he said.
 County Engineer John Cunard underscored many of Forsyth’s recently completed road and sidewalk projects while previewing those slated for the near future.
 The Pilgrim Mill Road expansion, which Cunard called a “tremendous project for the area,” is set for completion before the end of the year.
 Clearing for the Ronald Reagan Boulevard extension recently began. The 3.6-mile, $60 million project will provide a parallel alternative to Ga. 400 and connect McFarland Parkway to Majors Road.
 The county is currently acquiring right of way to expand Old Atlanta Road to four lanes with a raised median, curb and gutter, sidewalks and turn lanes.
 The Coal Mountain Connector, a new, 1-mile road from Ga. 9 to Ga. 369, is also in the works, Cunard said.

The college football season is underway and slowly but surely working its way back to pretty much full participation. The NFL season has three full weeks under its belt. The NHL just crowned a Stanley Cup champion and the NBA will crown its champion within a week or two. Major League Baseball just began its playoff tournament.
   
 Despite all that has gone on with respect to the COVID-19 pandemic, the world of sports has continued to turn. Despite all the predictions of doom and gloom, all the scientists and "experts" who made claims that it is impossible to happen without a coronavirus vaccine, the world of sports has returned.
   
 And it will even get better the next few weeks as we start to see stadiums allow fans to trickle in. That, too, was predicted to not be possible until there was a vaccine.
   
 Yet here we are, with wall-to-wall sports almost every day, and soon the stadiums without fans will be the exception, not the rule. And despite that, I am still reading about how terrible it is that sports are being played, how hard it is to enjoy sports right now and how these temporary formats/rules changes make it feel like it is not real.
   
 Look, I am not trying to be a pie in the sky type of person here, but all of you doom-and-gloomers and negative Nancy types need to come up for air a little bit. It is time to stop shaming people for enjoying sports and just sit back and enjoy the fact that we have achieved some level of normalcy.
   
 Yes, there are setbacks and it isn't perfect. We knew that going into all of this. We knew there would be tough days, there would be hiccups, there would be protocols that need to be tweaked and there may be times when teams have to sit out for a week or two. We knew all that. We knew it wouldn't be easy and we knew there would be some sacrifices.
   
 What boggles my mind, though, is through all of this we still have many who choose to focus on the negative. They choose to cling to every piece of bad news or every setback and make bold declarations like, "This is why we shouldn't be doing this!"
   
 It makes no sense.
   
 America is a bitter place to be in right now because we are mired in a pandemic, racial unrest and an election that is as divisive as any I can recall. There is so much negativity; we are starving for things to take our minds off the real world for a while.
   
 That's why the restart of sports has been a good development. They are entertainment, and while I know there is a push by athletes to be socially aware, once the games begin, we are focused on scores and statistics. We are focused on who is winning and losing and the incredible performances of the best athletes in the world.
   
 That's also why many of you need to stop whining because you don't like the extra-inning rules in baseball and just enjoy that we have baseball back. Stop whining because a few college football games each week need to be canceled and enjoy the fact that the overwhelming majority of the games are being played.
   
 And stop complaining because the atmosphere in the bubble isn't what you think it should be. Why not just enjoy that the Tampa Bay Lightning played some incredible hockey over the last month? And one of the greatest to ever play in the NBA is back in the Finals again, against the team with which he won his first NBA title?
   
 It isn't perfect. It isn't going to be perfect. Yes, the Titans-Steelers game is postponed this week because of an outbreak, but why is this a surprise? MLB had some hiccups along the way and it just began a playoffs that some predicted would never happen.
   
 There are plenty of things to complain about these days, but I have news for you -- sports aren't one of them. The fact that we have them has defied the odds, and we should see them as a symbol of optimism that life can go on despite the pandemic that we are engulfed in.

PEKIN - Charged with the care of residents in 215 tiny apartments at the UAW Senior Citizens Center in Pekin, building manager Donald Bly would like to know more about the Legionnaires' disease outbreak in Tazewell County.
   
 Two residents at the center have gotten sick from the bacteria - one, a man in his 70s, died Aug. 16 and the other just got out of the hospital, Bly said during a phone interview Wednesday morning. But there are more cases out there in the county. On Sept. 10, the Tazewell County Health Department issued an alert for Legionnaires' disease because there had been four cases since July, an increase of 66% compared to the same time last year.
   
 Bly, who has worked at the UAW Senior Citizens Center for 32 years, wonders why the bacteria has suddenly shown up in the building.
   
 "For this to be happening, it just tears me apart," he said. "We never had this problem in the past, and now we are having it. Is it in our water in Pekin? They haven't told us where those other cases are. That information should be made public so people are aware of it."
   
 There have been a total of seven cases of Legionnaires' disease in Tazewell County this year, including the two at the UAW Senior Citizens Center, said Melaney Arnold, spokesperson for the Illinois Department of Public Health. After the first resident tested positive, IDPH staff came on-site to collect water specimens which later tested positive for Legionella bacteria. The IDPH will continue to work with the facility to provide guidance on mitigation measures, said Arnold.
   
 When asked for more details about the other cases of Legionnaires' disease in Tazewell County, Arnold did not respond.
   
 Legionnaires' disease is a serious type of pneumonia caused when people breath in mist or aspirate water containing legionella bacteria, according to the Centers for Disease Control. It's not spread human to human and healthy people usually don't get sick from legionella. Those at increased risk are people over 50, smokers, people with lung disease, a weakened immune system or cancer, and people with other illnesses like diabetes, kidney failure or liver failure.
   
 Legionella is found naturally in freshwater environments, like lakes and streams. It can become a health concern when it grows and spreads in building water systems. People can get it by inhaling mist in the shower or from hot water rushing into the sink.
   
 Residents at the UAW Senior Citizens Center have been under water usage restrictions that include no showers, said Bly.
   
 "They can use their bathroom faucet and kitchen faucet but the stream should be no larger than a pencil, because the way this travels is through water droplets or mist," he said. "And we are installing shower heads with filters that will stop the bacteria from coming out."
   
 The whole endeavor is going to be expensive for the center.
   
 "The shower head filters, there's 215 apartments here, so that was $27,000 for shower heads. And then we're also changing out the aerators for every apartment, and the city required us to put a backflow preventer in, which stops our water from backing up and going into the city water. So it's gonna be north of six figures to get this taken care of," said Bly.
   
 Ultimately, the center will be installing a filtration system for the entire building.
   
 "We're hoping to do it within the next 60 days," said Bly. "What this system will do is, the water that comes into the building will go through the water softener then through a filtration system where it will be heated to 160, then go through a valve to cool the water to 140 degrees. I think 140 degrees kills the bacteria."
   
 Bly said the complex has an emergency fund that will take care of the cost of eradicating legionella in the building.
   
 "We're gonna be OK, but then you think about the other buildings out there that's not OK, it's not good," he said. "How many other buildings might be affected and not know it," Bly wondered.
   
 "This problem is starting to spread across the nation because, during the COVID virus, office buildings pretty much shut down because employees worked from home… now employees are going back to work, after toilets not being flushed and sinks not being run, and that water sitting in tanks and pipes has gotten stale. As a matter of fact, the CDC building in Atlanta has got it - the Health Department told me that. So I guess it's a spin off from the COVID virus."
   
 As the shutdowns began to ease, health officials urged building managers to flush out the water systems in buildings that had been vacant for weeks. But the UAW Senior Citizens Center has been up and running the whole time, said Bly.
   
 "We've never had anything like this because our water is always moving, it's always recycling through the building, it's not standing still. That's one thing we've got to figure out is why did that happen here," said Bly. "I know that I've seen press reports that Tazewell County is on alert for Legionnaires, so that sounds a little coincidental that at the same time we're having this problem, there's other cases out there."

 NURSES have been urged to read widely and keep abreast of the latest developments in the health delivery system.
 The call was made by Dr Tsitsi Mugure, the principal clinical director with the Parirenyatwa Group of Hospitals.
 Dr Mugure was speaking during a handover of medical books for nurse training that were donated to the hospital’s School of Nursing by the Rotary Club of Highlands on Tuesday.
 “I am a former teacher and I know the importance of reading widely. As nurses, sometimes you might come across patients who are knowledgeable and may, therefore, put you to a test. If one does not read widely, that person can be found wanting when exposed to such situations,” Dr Mugure said.
