Little mistakes blow up into bigger problems.
 That is what Shawn Egge, the Williston Keybirds coach, said about a game- changing fifth inning that led to the Keybirds’ 2-0 loss against the Grand Forks Blue Devils (Royals) Tuesday, August 4 in the first round of the Senior Babe Ruth Class AA State Tournament in Bismarck.
 However, this does not mean the Keybirds go home.
 They play again at 10 a.m. Wednesday, August 5 against Fargo Post 400 in a consolation game.
 The Keybirds held off the Blue Devils until the bottom of the fifth.
 The Keybirds’ Garret Hill was on the mound when he hit the Blue Devils’ Ross Meyer, giving him first base.
 With Meyer on first, the Blue Devils’ Jackson Haagenson bunted the ball down the first base line, sending Meyer to second.
 Hill fielded the ball, and when he turned to throw the ball to first he lost his footing and the ball tipped off Keybirds’ first baseman Camdin Miller’s glove.
 Meyer advanced to third on the error, with Haagenson on first.
 After Haagenson stole second, the Blue Devils’ Dillon Kuntz hit a line drive single to center field, bringing Meyer and Haagenson home.
 “It’s just one of those things when you get to tournament time it’s just those little mistakes that come back and really blow up…(into) a bigger problem,” Egge said. “So up until that point we have been doing very well and it's just the little things that they capitalized on.”
 But the Keybirds held the Blue Devils scoreless in all other innings.
 Egge said at that point, they were just trying to keep the Blue Devils off the scoreboard.
 “It’s tough. You try to tell the kids, when it comes tournament time, that those little things become some of the biggest problems,” Egge said of the inning. “So you just really gotta try to minimize them. They capitalized, we didn’t...Those are the types of games that you really gotta focus up a little harder than normal because now it’s state tournament time.”
 Despite the loss, Egge said the team strengthened its defense heading into the tournament, and Hill was the guy they needed on the mound.
 Overall, Hill had seven strikeouts, only walked one batter and gave up two runs, neither of which were earned.
 “We never really thought we were out of that game, which is really nice,” Egge said. “The kids were still in the game...they were still trying to stir some things together so there’s still that motivation and enthusiasm behind them which is really good to see especially going into (Wednesday).”
 As for the next game, Egge said his team is aware of what they need to improve on such as grinding out at bats a little more and taking advantage of mistake pitches.
 “I think they’re going to focus on that tomorrow,” he said. “It’s just that one inning that really threw a wrench in the game...a lot of these kids don’t want to go home and I expect them to come out tomorrow guns blazing.”

Massachusetts is among seven states that are entering formal talks with manufacturers with the goal of facilitating rapid point-of-care antigen tests that could more quickly detect COVID-19 outbreaks in workplaces, schools and congregate care settings.
 Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, who announced the interstate testing compact Tuesday, negotiated the agreement with the Rockefeller Foundation in his final days as chairman of the National Governors Association. Plans call for each state to purchase 500,000 tests.
 "Increasing both testing capacity and access to testing is a critical part of stopping the spread of COVID-19," Gov. Charlie Baker said in a statement. "We are pleased to join this interstate compact and look forward to working with this bipartisan group of governors to collectively build on these shared goals."
 Earlier Tuesday, Baker told reporters that "one of the things we are working on developing is an ability to do some rapid mobile testing for schools once schools open." The governor did not elaborate on his intentions.
 The governors of Louisiana, Michigan, Ohio and Virginia are also in the compact, and North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper announced his intent to join Tuesday after the compact was initially announced with the release of a formal but nonbinding letter of intent.
 The states are in talks with Becton Dickinson and Quidel, the U.S. manufacturers of the antigen tests, to purchase more than 3 million total tests, which Hogan's office says can deliver results in 15 to 20 minutes.
 In May, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued its first emergency use authorization for a COVID-19 antigen test to Quidel Corporation. The FDA said the new category of diagnostic test could "quickly detect fragments of proteins found on or within the virus by testing samples collected from the nasal cavity using swabs."
 At the time, the agency said positive results from antigen tests were highly accurate, but cautioned that "there is a higher chance of false negatives, so negative results do not rule out infection." The agency also said it expected to authorize more antigen tests.
 According to Hogan's office, the purchasing agreement shows manufacturers there is demand to scale up production of the tests and the cooperative will help states to buy tests and supplies in a "sustainable and cost-effective manner."
 "With severe shortages and delays in testing and the federal administration attempting to cut funding for testing, the states are banding together to acquire millions of faster tests to help save lives and slow the spread of COVID-19," Hogan said. "I want to thank my fellow governors for signing on to this groundbreaking bipartisan agreement, which we have just finalized after weeks of discussions with the Rockefeller Foundation. We will be working to bring additional states, cities, and local governments on board as this initiative moves forward."

WASHINGTON (AP) — The State Department’s acting inspector general resigned abruptly on Wednesday following the firing of his predecessor in circumstances now being investigated by Congress.Stephen Akard announced his resignation just two days after Democrats issued subpoenas for several of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s top aides to answer questions about the shakeup in the watchdog’s office. The department said Akard would return to the private sector but offered no other reason for his departure."We appreciate his dedication to the department and to our country," the department said in a statement. Akard's deputy, Diana Shaw, will serve as the new acting inspector general once Akard leaves on Friday.Although Akard had not been expected to become the permanent inspector general, his departure underscores the tumult and uncertainty in the office, which has been wracked by Republican charges of leaks and politically biased investigations.Democrats have alleged that Pompeo sought the ouster of Akard's predecessor, Stephen Linick, because Linick was investigating allegations of impropriety by Pompeo.Pompeo has denied the allegations but acknowledged he asked President Donald Trump to fire Linick for poor performance. Akard, who had also served as the director of the Office of Foreign Missions at the State Department, had withdrawn from those investigations.Inspectors general are independent watchdogs empowered by Congress to evaluate the performance of executive branch agencies and investigate allegations of wrongdoing by government officials. President Donald Trump has taken exception to the work of several of the inspectors general and removed them despite congressional objections.On Monday, House Democrats subpoenaed four senior Pompeo aides for interviews, saying the Trump administration was stonewalling their investigation into Linick's firing in May. Akard was not among those subpoenaed.Linick had appeared before investigators in June and said top department officials tried to bully him and dissuade his office from conducting a review of a multibillion dollar arms sale to Saudi Arabia before he was fired. He also said his office was looking into allegations that Pompeo and his wife may have misused government staff to run personal errands and several other matters.The top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Sen. Bob Menendez of New Jersey, said the investigation will not end and he expressed concern about Akard’s departure.“I do not believe he was the right choice to lead the office, but I am concerned that his sudden resignation leaves another opportunity for the Trump administration to try to weaken oversight and accountability,” Menendez said. “The ongoing bicameral investigation into the abrupt and unexplained dismissal of IG Linick will continue full speed ahead.”The subpoenas for closed-door depositions are for Undersecretary of State for Management Brian Bulatao, acting State Department legal adviser Marik String, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Political-Military Affairs Michael Miller and senior adviser Toni A. Porter.The department flatly rejected the Democrats' allegations as "egregiously inaccurate" but did not say whether the officials would comply with the subpoenas. Pompeo has rejected allegations that Linick was fired for investigating alleged impropriety and Pompeo has denied he was aware of any such probe into his or his wife's matters. He has said Linick was removed for not doing his job.Linick, who had been inspector general since 2013, said he was in a “state of shock” when he was fired. He told congressional investigators that he had opened a review of last year’s $8 billion arms sale to Saudi Arabia at the request of lawmakers who claimed Pompeo had inappropriately circumvented Congress to approve the deal. He said Bulatao and String then tried to stop him.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

SENECA FALLS — Like many colleges and universities, New York Chiropractic College has seen a decline in enrollment because of the COVID-19 pandemic.
 Specific enrollment figures for the college’s post-graduate programs were not available Tuesday, but college President Dr. Michael Mestan said it was down 25 percent from anticipated and budgeted fall enrollment numbers.
 The college has tried many steps to save money to weather the storm, but Mestan says it’s now time for more drastic measures.
 In a message for the college community Monday, Mestan announced these steps, effective Sept. 1:
 • The college will not provide cost-of-living adjustments to pay for the 2020-21 fiscal year.
 • Overtime will be kept to a minimum and require prior approval by division heads.
 • There will be pay reductions for college employees. Mestan himself will see a 16.5% reduction. Senior staff will see an 11.5% reduction and all other faculty and staff will see a 6.5% reduction. The pay cuts are expected to remain for the entire fiscal year but will be reviewed regularly to determine if they should continue. This does not affect student workers.
 • The college’s retirement match percentage and health care contributions will remain unchanged at this time.
 • Furloughs are now “inescapable,” according to Mestan. They will begin Sept. 1 and will affect a limited number of employees who cannot complete their job responsibilities either on campus or remotely. Impacted workers will be notified by their supervisor this week and will receive additional details from the Human Resources Department. The furloughs are expected to be temporary and will be constantly re-assessed.
 The college employs 47 full-time faculty, 40 part-time faculty, 124 full-time staff and 61 part-time staff. Mestan said the college plans to furlough 3 full-time staff and 25 part-time staff, most of them working in the athletic center, which has been closed for months because of the pandemic.
 “Our college community has worked diligently to support our students’ pursuit of their educational goals under extraordinary circumstances,” Mestan said.
 He said the college has shifted courses to online learning, created a thorough, safety-focused reopening plan, advocated aggressively to open campus safely before other traditional higher educational institutions, reopened its health centers, provided student clerks with crucial clinical experience and even returned some students to campus early in order to finish their incomplete winter trimester course work.
 “It has not been easy, but I know our students are immensely grateful for the strides we have made in these months,” Mestan said.
 But he said the ongoing public health crisis clearly has created longer term challenges from which NYCC is not exempt. “As an enrollment-dependent institution, the COVID-19 pandemic has particularly affected us and many other colleges and universities as we experience the growing trend of students deciding to defer or delay educational plans in the face of broad uncertainty,” he said.
 “A few months ago, we enjoyed robust pools of prospective students. Now we face a significant shortfall in incoming fall enrollment. We must plan for the unpredictable but probable, resurgency of the virus, which would likely bring additional significant financial consequences,” Mestan said.
 He said the college faces significant budget shortfalls in the coming academic year and steps taken so far to control spending, while effective, will not be enough.
 ‘We must now take additional difficult steps to exercise responsible fiscal management for our college,” he said. “I know hearing this news is not easy and regret that it may cause anxiety in this time that is already stressful.”
 Mestan said he will host a town hall meeting Thursday via Zoom to discuss the situation further.
 “I look forward to the day when we can return to normal NYCC operations. Until then, as ever, I am grateful for this dedicated, caring community and will continue to strive to support our college through this pandemic and beyond,” he concluded.
