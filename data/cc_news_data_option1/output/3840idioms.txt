The new crime problem affecting citizens and hurting small businesses doesn't have complex sociological roots. It's because of City Hall. In addition to lax prosecution, especially of a core of repeat offenders, the mayor and City Council are to blame.
 Mayor Jenny Durkin appears uncomfortable interacting with the business community and has lost power to an assertive council. That body is obsessed with defunding the police without a viable Plan B. Its membership is stuffed with career activists and pols, with thin business experience at best.
 No wonder the council is hostile to business. Even the smallest shop is exploitative capitalism. The council's loudest voices are running a "revolution."
 Only in a city made so prosperous by hated capitalism could this intellectual Ponzi scheme be tolerated or seem without consequences.
 One of the things that most struck me about Seattle, its defining trait, was a genius for continuing reinvention. This was embodied by people such as Paul Allen and Bill Gates Sr., now both gone, and a host of civic stewards. Mostly business leaders, they were indispensable.

It further states, “In implementing the principles under subsection (2) of this section, the institutions established under this Act shall promote integrated water resources management and the coordinated management of land and water resources, surface water and ground water resources, river basins and adjacent marine and coastal environment and upstream and downstream interests.” Another obnoxious content of the Bill reads in Section 2(1), “All surface water and ground water wherever it occurs, is a resource common to all people.”<br

KENT — Kids who live in the sprawling Birch Creek subsidized-housing complex have long turned to the on-site youth center for after-school homework help and sports programs.
 So when Kent public schools opened for virtual school this September, the center began inviting kids from large families to use the space to study.
 Word about the center’s new role as a learning hub began to spread.  
 Now, about 25 students arrive at the center each school day. There are bubbly kindergartners who have never been in a classroom and self-possessed high school students, the cool veterans of the K-12 system. They settle into desks and tables in five rooms, grouped by age, while staffers move around the building — helping them log in and navigate the complexities of online learning platforms, offering lunch, keeping them on task, encouraging them to take breaks. The kids get to see friends, socialize, play a little pickup basketball.
 Elsewhere, many children don’t get that benefit at all. About 1 million Washington students are learning remotely this year, and educators worry the pandemic will exacerbate an already steep academic divide between the haves and have-nots. Families who can afford to do so are hiring tutors and forming small learning communities, also known as pandemic pods or microschools, to keep their kids on track. Parents who work from home are playing teaching assistant and solving tech problems on the fly.
 But there are thousands of parents who must leave the house every day to work, who need child care, don’t have internet access or the tech skills needed to solve tricky computer problems, perhaps also struggle with English. These parents are disproportionately people of color. What happens to their children?

As audiences diversify -- the fastest-growing markets are in Asia, the Middle East and South America; women constitute 18% of all gamers in India and that number is growing at twice the rate of male gamers, according to a Think With Google report released this year -- there's finally some diversity creeping into mainstream gaming.
 From the Lara Croft and Grand Theft Auto templates -- White, often blond, women and men, all with perfect bodies -- there's a move to expand avatar types, add clothes and hair styles that represent different cultures, and offer greater gender fluidity.
 In Nintendo's Animal Crossing social simulation game, the latest iteration of which was released in March, players can pick from a range of clothing and hairstyles (options include a sari; but rather maddeningly, still no curly hair). Taniesha Bracken-Hucks, 26, an American gamer, is now petitioning to have curly hair added to the menu, because without it, she argues, there's just no accounting for the average Black woman's natural look. Her Change.org petition has gathered 50,000 signatures.
 But the video game industry, which is worth more than both the movie and music industries combined, has a lot of ground to cover when it comes on diversity in gender and ethnic representation. Female characters still get far too little screen time, spend most of their time in supporting roles, are objectified and hypersexualised.
 "We're still very far from having gender parity. Games like The Last of Us 2 and Apex Legends are nowhere close to being representative of the industry," said Vamika Johri, 29, a doctor and avid gamer from Delhi. "Most lead characters are still white males; most women remain scantily clad and their roles are reduced to helping the main character develop into who he ultimately becomes."
 Even in Bayonetta, where the lead is a strong female character, she goes into combat wearing a low-cut spandex suit.
 "The issues of inclusivity in any industry and in any country are a reflection of that society in general. It is business and any advocacy has to face that reality. In games globally, women and ethnic minorities are underrepresented but this gets discussed regularly at game events and conferences and… every year we see it is getting better," said PR Rajendran, co-founder and CEO of game development company Nextwave.
 Players such as Ibrahim Pervez, 25, a computer programmer from Pune, say it's nice to at least be able to pick a generic Indian avatar.
 "In Modern Warfare, you can now pick characters that are Asian, African, African-American, Middle-Eastern. But that's still the exception, not the rule," he adds.

In Moscow, analysts for the Kremlin and its Security Council are working overtime to war-game scenarios for a Joe Biden presidency.
 Increasingly alarmed at the prospect of a White House without Donald Trump, Russia is trying to determine what that'll mean for sensitive issues from nuclear arms to relations with China, energy exports, sanctions and far-flung global conflicts, according to people familiar with the efforts. Though few see much prospect for improved ties if Trump is re-elected, Biden would likely be bad news for Russia, people close to the leadership said.
 A Democratic victory may even give the Kremlin another reason to tear up its own electoral calendar, moving up parliamentary elections to the spring to get them out of the way before a new administration has time to impose additional sanctions or other penalties, according to a person close to the Kremlin, who spoke on condition of anonymity to express that opinion.
 With so much at stake, Russia's already meddling in the campaign, according to US officials. But the situation is different from 2016, when Trump's victory surprised even his backers in Moscow.
 US politics have become so polarized that there's little need for Russia to step in and invent new controversies, according to a senior British intelligence official. Russia is nonetheless conducting a "very active" campaign to denigrate Biden and sow divisions in the US political scene, FBI Director Christopher Wray said last week.
 The Russian leadership hasn't written off Trump yet, according to Gleb Pavlovsky, a former Kremlin adviser. "It's not clear what kind of help they could offer Trump, but they'd give it to him as long as it didn't provoke a big scandal," he said. "They don't want to trigger a boomerang effect."
 The US leader is making Russia's task easier through his own brand of information warfare, including repeated claims that mail-in voting will lead to massive fraud, assertions that Russian state media are amplifying.
 Russian officials deny meddling, either now or in the 2016 elections. On Friday, Putin proposed that the US and Russia exchange guarantees of non- interference in elections, according to a statement on the Kremlin website. He also called for talks on information security and restoring cybersecurity cooperation, reviving a proposal he floated after the 2016 election.
 Since that vote, Moscow's infatuation with Trump has dimmed. Russian officials say "Russophobia" in the US establishment won't change no matter who's in the White House. But the contrast between the two candidates is striking. While Trump said last week that China and mail-in voting were greater threats than Russia, Biden has said he'd make Moscow pay for meddling, calling Russia an opponent.
 Meanwhile, tensions are flaring with Germany and France over the poisoning of Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny, raising the prospect of a deep freeze if Trump loses.
 "If Biden is elected, we will confront a consolidation of the West on an anti- Russian platform," said Andrey Kortunov, head of the Kremlin-founded Russian International Affairs Council.
 The prospect of new Western sanctions on Russia has helped drive the ruble to the lowest levels since April. Even as the economy plunged amid the Covid-19 lockdown earlier this year, the Kremlin was cautious about spending, continuing to husband hundreds of billions of dollars it's stashed in rainy- day funds for potential future crises.
 Kremlin animus toward Biden goes way back, dating at least to when he visited Moscow in 2011 as vice president and told opposition leaders he thought Vladimir Putin shouldn't run for president again. That kind of affront isn't quickly forgotten, according to a person close to the Kremlin. Putin moved this year to extend his rule to 2036.
 The Russian leadership relishes the chance to turn the tables on Washington after decades of what the Kremlin sees as sometimes-crude efforts to manipulate Russian politics, according to a person close to the authorities.
 But Facebook and other social media companies are taking a more proactive stance on stopping disinformation, taking down accounts linked to the Kremlin. Late Thursday, Facebook said it removed more Russian disinformation efforts. The Treasury Department, meanwhile, sanctioned a Ukrainian politician it called a Russian agent for efforts to tar Biden for alleged corruption related to his son's business dealings in Ukraine.
 "There is very little incentive for the Russians to stop the information operations they've been doing," said Michael Daniel, who formerly served as cybersecurity coordinator in the Barack Obama White House and currently leads the Cyber Threat Alliance organization. "What I don't think they necessarily have a strong incentive to do is take a step that would drive the US to a much greater degree of retaliation."
 Fiona Hill, the National Security Council's senior director for European and Russian affairs until 2019, says divisions are emerging within the Kremlin over the wisdom of continuing a "dirty tricks" campaign that's had mixed results and may now face diminishing returns.
 On the one hand, Russia's 2016 influence operations succeeded beyond the Kremlin's wildest dreams. The US-dominated, unipolar world that Putin has long railed against is no longer. America's global leadership, NATO, the European Union and the structure of institutions and alliances the US built after World War II have taken a hit. "On that ledger, wow, yes, basically over-fulfilled the plan," said Hill.
 At the same time, getting caught in the act of trying to sabotage US democracy has proved costly. "They lost the entire US political class and politicized ties so that the whole future of US-Russia relations now depends on who wins in November," she said.
