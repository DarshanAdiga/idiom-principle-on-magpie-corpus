The Redskins were the last team to integrate in the NFL, signing their first Black player—Bobby Mitchell—in 1962.
 US Sen. Tom Udall of New Mexico, speaking during Jeff Sessions confirmation hearing as attorney general in 2017, recalled how his father, then Secretary of the Interior Stewart Udall, helped force the Redskins to integrate in the 1960s.
 "Everyone knew [Preston Marshall] was a bigot and racist," according to a transcript of the hearing. "He said: This is never going to happen. We are not going to integrate the Redskins."
 Udall said his father told the NFL owner that because the stadium was on US Park Service property, they would refuse to renew the stadium's lease unless the team integrated.
 Griffith bought the Washington Senators in 1961, moved the franchise to Minneapolis and renamed it the Twins.
 He admitted in a speech to the Lions Club in Waseca, Minnesota, on September 28, 1978, that he moved the team for purely racist reasons, according to Minneapolis Star-Tribune's reporter Nick Coleman.
 After making sure there were no Blacks in the Lions Club audience, Griffith explained his rationale, Coleman wrote.
 "It was when I found out you only had 15,000 blacks here." Coleman quotes Griffith as saying. "We came here because you've got good, hard-working, White people here."

Oh, my knee-jerk reaction is to say that I would keep them because then we're sort of whitewashing our own history, but I would like to have them highlighted. Like, "we gave this guy a Pulitzer Prize for basically not telling the truth." ( _Laughs_.) And examine that and really think about it. In my mind, like Aung San Suu Kyi right now with the Nobel Prize. Like, what the fuck is she doing? You know what I mean? I don't want to take it away from her, but I do think we should go, "This is someone that we really thought was doing the right thing and wanted the right thing. What made her stop? Was it that way all along? What's the deal?" It should sort of direct our attention. The actual awards that go to the right people, that's all well and good, and that's cool. I think that we should actually specifically focus on these people, and if I were teaching history in school, this is what I would specifically focus on. Because there's more to learn than from the obvious Mother Teresas, right?

Jack Carlin Hilbourne   March 14, 1925 - June 14, 2020   Jack Carlin Hilbourne died peacefully at home of congestive heart failure after a year of in-home care by his loving wife. For the past six months, his wife and a team of amazing caregivers and hospice workers cared for him. Over 95 years, Jack's love of adventure, endless curiosity, boundless enthusiasm, and high regard by all who knew him afforded him a full and wonderful life.   Born in Los Angeles to Jane Carlin and Arthur Hilbourne in 1925, Jack and his family moved east to Edgemont, S.D., during the Great Depression in 1930. Arthur got a job with the CCC, then remained a full time civil servant for Jack's entire childhood. Because of the itinerant nature of that work, Jack attended four grade schools and three high schools.   He graduated from Jefferson High School in Portland, Ore., in 1942. His family moved to Seattle, and he enrolled at the University of Washington. The United States was still at war in the Pacific, and Jack enlisted in the Navy spending four years as a Petty Officer Aviation Machinist's Mate in Memphis and New Orleans. He told his grandsons stories much later about catching thrilling rides with the test pilots who would take him up on stunt flights in the Navy.   Leveraging the G.I. Bill, Jack was accepted to Pacific University in Forest Grove in 1947. He received his bachelor's degree in science in 1950, and became a Doctor of Optometry in 1951. Kaiser immediately hired Jack as its first optometrist. In those early days, this was an experiment to see if eye care and medicine would work well together. Off the clock, Jack made ski trips to Sun Valley, climbed Mount Hood, went water skiing and camping, and thoroughly enjoyed himself as a young bachelor both on and off the slopes. He became the president of Oregon's Cascade Ski Club in 1960.   Jack met Irene Medycki in 1968, they were married in 1969, and in 1970 and 1971, their two sons were born. They settled into a beautiful home in Portland Heights. Jack taught his kids to ski, became Chief of Optometry at Kaiser, loved British automobiles, kept fit at the MAC, played golf, and danced at the Winter Club with his wife and friends. He watched his boys grow up into old men, and he watched four grandchildren become teenagers. Jack skied until he was 85 years old, and he enjoyed traveling the world with Irene until very recently.   He is survived by his wife, Irene; their two sons, Jason (Greta), their sons, Kai and Sam, and Zachary (Amber), and their sons, Tristan and Cyrus; two nieces and three nephews; and a surprising number of extended family and friends for his age!   A memorial service will be scheduled later this summer when we can safely gather to celebrate Jack's full life. Remember Jack fondly, and be kind to each other.

Dredge the fish fillets in the egg, then the cornmeal mixture, making sure to coat evenly. Heat oil in the pan over high heat, then gently lay the fillets into the pan. Make sure they are not touching each other. Fry the fillets until they are golden brown, about 2-5 minutes per side. Set on paper towels to drain any oil. Spread the tartar sauce on both sides of the buns, then add the lettuce, fish fillets, tomato and bacon — and enjoy.

Well, vacation season is upon us.
   
 Many of us likely had plans to get away for a bit and recharge somewhere away from home, maybe even outside of Kansas. Given the COVID-19 situation, that likely isn't possible for many of us anymore.
   
 Sulk a bit if you must. It feels like an eternity since March. But we suggest you still take some vacation time to recharge and relax even if it's just a staycation.
   
 The term staycation came into popularity only about a decade ago during the financial crisis of the late 2000s, but people have been taking these vacations for long before that. Now is as good a time as any to make it a glamorous one.
   
 To make your staycation a success, we suggest you start by unplugging. If you can take a few days to set work, chores and other responsibilities aside. Make yourself a priority. Work can wait. In doing so, you'll be more apt to relax which is the whole point of a vacation.
   
 Find a space that will allow you to do things you enjoy. Take in a movie on Netflix, binge watch a show, read a book, play games with your family -- whatever works.
   
 Explore things about your community safely. Some time outside the house can be good for you. Check out new places in your community. Learn about the place you call home. We're sure there's something you don't already know or views you haven't taken in.
   
 Try restaurants you've never been to. Just remember to wash your hands and wear a mask when necessary and of course, practice social distancing.
   
 Have a sense of humor about it. Maybe send someone a postcard with a scenic view of your couch or get a local postcard and send that.
   
 Remember to find a way to document your vacation. Vacations are about making memories, so perhaps take a picture or two. What's a vacation without pictures anyway. As the kids say: Did it really happen if it's not on Instagram?
   
 If pictures aren't your thing, perhaps keep a journal. It will help you remember years from now what you did during your quarantine vacation way back in 2020.
   
 If you can afford to, splurge a little on something. Maybe a nice dinner or two, some new plants for the porch or patio or even a new TV. There's some justification for opening your pocketbook if you're able. Besides these things might last longer than a typical vacation.
   
 Whatever you do, find a way to recharge, relax and come back to the stress of your daily grind with clear eyes and a full heart.

However, in the jail’s cramped conditions, concerns that COVID-19 could run rampant if inmates became infected have animated conversations about the jail’s sanitary and safety response. Public officials and government watchdog groups have called for the release of medically vulnerable inmates to the maximum degree compatible with public safety. Since mid-March, the Sheriff’s Office has released more than 300 inmates — low-level offenders and many who were being held in pre-trial detention due to their inability to pay bail. This was done to decrease the risk of an outbreak that could jeopardize inmates and staff.

She came easily to me because Terri Taylor showed me her tape, but Terri looked at more than a hundred kids for this. I'm glad you like her because we were all blown away by her. Avery had done, I think, just a couple commercials and a couple episodic TV things. I looked at a bunch of tapes and met a bunch of kids, and she was just, by far, the best. And she's _so natural_. She'd be bouncing around off the walls and being a normal kid on the set, and then you say, "Action," and she just locks in in a way that's almost disconcerting. She's so good. And then, you say, "Cut," and she's back to being a crazy kid again. I've seen a couple kids who are really something like Dakota Fanning in _War of the Worlds_ and Joseph Mazzello in _Jurassic Park_. There are some kids who really have that natural thing, and I really feel that she's another of them. I don't know if she wants to act anymore, or if her parents want her to, but, boy, I think she's got a future if she wants it.

L’ultimo test è stato effettuato qualche giorno fa tra Torbole e Riva. Proprio in acque trentine, la stazione della Forestale di Riva del Garda ha portato a termine un’indagine, su delega della Procura di Rovereto, relativa al reato di abbandono rifiuti nel lago di Garda. Nel mirino degli inquirenti sono finiti anche cime e plinti in cemento che servono per fissare e zavorrare le boe sul fondale. Per questo sono stati realizzati video con un piccolo sottomarino del Nucleo sommozzatori dei Vigili del Fuoco di Trento, comandato a distanza. Si è scoperto così che nei fondali trentini del Benaco giacciono un gran numero di conglomerati in cemento. Si è ipotizzato che annualmente, solamente nel Garda trentino, ne siano stati immersi circa 3000, legati ad almeno 45 quintali di cordame. Quest’ultimo unisce il corpo morto, cioè la zavorra alla boa.
