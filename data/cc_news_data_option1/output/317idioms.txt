 Urchins make the trip to the Len Salmon Stadium on Saturday to take on Rob Small's side in the Isthmian League Premier Division.
 Bowers were promoted as Isthmian North champions last season and are 15th in the table but boss Stimson knows how hard it is after getting promoted.
 "I know a few people there and from an outside point of view I think they're having a great season," Stimson said.
 "If they survive I think that's a huge achievement. I've been in that situation when I went up with Thurrock, and survival is as good as promotion.
 "I know it's hard to say that as they did so well last year and won lots in recent years, but they're having a great season and their points tally is very good, so they'll be looking to push on."

MLS continues to improve, not overnight, but over the long haul. Signing Chicharito, whether he plays well for one season or five, only helps MLS on and off the field. Chicharito grappling with the coming end of his own playing career is no indictment on the league. Plus, as the player himself said Thursday, it's entirely possible he plays for some time more.

"It gives us an opportunity to have a little more flexibility in what we can do for clients," Dwyer said. "Artistically it's easy to operate in a studio because I know it like the back of my hand. I can and could come up with good photographs by doing what I've always done, but I began to notice the best of our work was the stuff in an environment I didn't know very well and had to create from the ground up."
 Dwyer said that work is challenging.
 "Clients expect the best," he said. "This will be an opportunity to work on the creative piece a little more."
 Being in business for 37 years, Dwyer has seen much of his retail portion of the business go away but said the company has been blessed to do a lot of commercial and corporate work, as well as events.
 "We have been blessed to continue to do what we love and make a reasonably good living," he said.
 Dwyer said they have had a home office for 10 years and will keep an eye out for a smaller location to store equipment and have a physical presence.
 "The new owners agreed to give us some storage space for extra equipment that isn't used as regularly," he said. "Clients won't see any difference. There won't be any difference in the way we work — Gail, myself and the staff that works on location with us."
