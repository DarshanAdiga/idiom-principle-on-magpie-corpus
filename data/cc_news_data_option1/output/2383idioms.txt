There’s no question of the importance of both issues. A disastrous primary day in Georgia this week, and one earlier in the year in Wisconsin, shows what can happen to traditional Election Days in the time of a pandemic. It can’t be allowed to happen here. Lamont says he does not have authority to issue another executive order pertaining to the November election, so it must come from the Legislature. That much of a basic agreement should be enough reason to call the special session.
 Then there is police accountability. While Lamont is saying the right words, this is an issue that cries out for public debate of the kind that should take place in a public session of the state Legislature. It does not call for a prearranged agreement between top officials that would then be approved in a pro-forma session. For one thing, such a move would shut out the minority party completely, when the moment calls for open dialogue and healthy give and take.
 Lamont has done well in leading the state through an emergency, but the time has come for the next step. That necessarily involves a more active role for state legislators to do the jobs they were elected to do. And when the Legislature meets, it should debate in public the major issues of the day. Anything else is subverting the people’s right to know what their government is doing.

Sarah Pierce, a policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute, said that the Supreme Court ruling requires the government to fully open the program back up-- to take in new applicants instead of just renewing existing ones-- but that it's not likely the Trump administration will do so without a lower court's order. "It's up in the air," Pierce said.

"We've got the state unemployment compensation. We've opened up 95% of our economy. We're urging everybody we can to get back to work," Lamont said, when asked about residents who say they can't make ends meet without the $600 weekly payments, which are currently slated to expire July 31. "You've got another month and now's the time to plan for that day that you get back to work, now that all the stores and businesses are pretty much open."

Capillary Driven Microfluidics: The crew configured the Light Microscopy Module (LMM) in preparation for Microfluidics science runs. The crew also took photos of overall view of ACE Module capillaries and each capillary (three) for closer view during removal. Capillary-Driven Microfluidics in Space (Capillary Driven Microfluidics) examines the drawing of fluids into a tiny narrow tube in microgravity. Results may improve current mathematical models and understanding of microfluidic systems and improve fluid control in various devices. Diagnostic devices require separation of blood cells and plasma, which have different densities, and the absence of sedimentation and buoyancy- driven convection in microgravity improves the efficiency of this separation.

"I am black, and within that, I am a Jamaican-born, African American man, but I call myself and identify as black," he explained."I have had to take on different identities at different periods of my life. But my blackness is the overarching umbrella of those different flavors of my identity."
 LaBeach's experience is just one example of the complexities of black identities, especially in the United States. Some people from other countries who live in the U.S. accept African American because of its cultural and historical roots in the black experience that is specific to this country. "African American technically isn't even what I am," he said. "I'm a Jamaican- born black person but I have taken on this label of African American because of where I live."
 These layers of racial identity can be extremely personal and nuanced. There are some Americans who identify as both, and some who prefer black over African American because they can't actually trace their lineage.
