Avoiding jets of fire, jumping over ledges, and – much like Swery’s oddball platformer, The Missing – Liu could become just a severed head rolling around and jumping all over the place like a bloodied football!

RICHMOND, Va. (WWBT) - The grounds of the Robert E. Lee statue, which has been unofficially renamed Marcus-David Peters Circle, were transformed into a birthday celebration of Marcus-David Peters, the 24-year- old Richmond biology teacher who was shot and killed by Richmond Police in 2018 while experiencing a mental health episode on Interstate 95.The Saturday celebration was organized in part by Peters' family. Peters’ sister, Princess Blanding, who has become an outspoken political activist since her brother’s death, says Saturday was as much about honoring Peters’ life as it is about pushing for police reform on a city and statewide level.“It hurts to know that we’re having a big party and the main host is not here,” Blanding said. “If a person’s kidneys fail, in the worst-case scenario, they will get started on dialysis. But our brain is the only organ that when it doesn’t function properly, we demonize them, especially if you’re Black. We’re going to demonize you, we’re going to criminalize you, we’re going to dehumanize you, we’re going to kill you. And that’s not acceptable.”Peters, who was a VCU alum, would have turned 27 this year. People who came to celebrate were asked to make a prayer at an ancestral alter by taking a scoop of grains inspired by Peters’ favorite colors and placing it by his memorial. Blanding says everything about the live performances, food and music was inspired by Peters' favorite things.“If you go to our food table, you’ll see a big bin of his favorite food that has Gushers and Fruit Roll-Ups. So we wanted people to have a little taste of something that Marcus has really, really enjoyed," said Blanding. ”We have a guitar player who also played one of Marcus’ favorite songs."During the celebration, plants and STEM technology kits were handed out to children under 18 years old to promote positive growth in their communities.“Those plants are really, really important and symbolic because it’s growth," Blanding said, “and we want them to take a pledge when they take a plant to help them to become a well-rounded citizen, right and then as they continue to take care of that they’re growing.”Blanding says the large crowd that gathered to remember Peters brought her a sense of closure, but she’s hoping that the collective energy from her brother’s birthday can be used to continue pushing for police reform."My strength is in knowing that my family and I won’t back down and we’re not going to give up and that we have as evident by this amazing presence of community members and supporters here. said Blanding. "We have a strong army of supporting us as we continue to fight for justice and reformation, as we continue to fight even for the Marcus Alert bill.Formally dubbed the mental health awareness response and community understanding services, or MARCUS, alert system, House Bill 5043 would require the Virginia Department of Behavioral Health and the Department of Criminal Justice Services to work together to create evidence-based training programs for the care teams so that they know-how, to effectively address, mitigate and de-escalate mental health crisis situations.Both chambers of the Virginia General Assembly have approved a proposal to establish a statewide system that pairs teams of mental health professionals and peer recovery specialists with police officers responding to mental health crises.The Senate approved the measure by a vote of 24-15 on Thursday Oct 1.The House gave the legislation the green light in September with a vote of 57-39. The proposal now needs a signature from Gov. Ralph Northam to become law. Blanding says she’s happy to see progress being made, but she believes the language of the bill is too weak to address all of the problems she believes still exist in the Richmond Police Department.“I’m encouraged and strengthened by the support of our community, the unshaken support, but I also am wise enough to know that the fight is far from over that there’s still so much work to be done,” said Blanding. “I’m wise enough to know that the fight is far from over, that there’s still so much work to be done. These false victories are not accepted and I won’t rejoice over them. A person is experiencing a mental health crisis deserves help, not death, with a huge period at the end of it.”“Marcus isn’t here in person, but he’s here in spirit and a lot of people since Marcus’s murder have reached out to me and said, ‘look, I’m dealing with mental health issues myself,’" Blanding said. "A lot of people who did not feel comfortable coming out publicly and talking about mental health issues that either they personally deal with, or that they deal with in their family, feel comfortable and feel safe saying, look, I deal with it, too.”Copyright 2020 WWBT.

The college football season is in full swing, and UGA has played two games. This is the 40th anniversary of the 1980 National Championship at UGA. UGA has had several shots in that time span to get their second or third but they've come up short. Most recently, they lost to Alabama in the 2017 national title game in Atlanta in overtime. UGA brought in former star Kirby Smart to bring the program back to prominence. He came close in his second season and looks to get his first this year or next year. 1980 was a special season besides winning the championship. First, we were introduced to one of the greatest players of all-time to play college football, Herschel Walker. Herschel Walker made his debut up in Tennessee at Neyland Stadium on a hot, warm September night. His first carry was a touchdown run that showcased what was to come. He ran over Tennessee's Bill Bates and that became the iconic run that started it all. Walker would win many accolades that season like SEC Freshman of the year and also broke a college record as most yards rushing as a freshman which he held for many years and eventually won the 1982 Heisman.
   
 Second, UGA had one of the epic plays of all time in Georgia history and possibly college football. Georgia was on the cusp of losing to Florida which would have been their first loss of the season in the annual World's Largest Cocktail Party. Georgia down 21-20 with a minute and 35 seconds left, saw Buck Belue and Lindsay Scott become Georgia's heroes. Belue's pass to Scott was epic with the legendary and late Larry Munson making his historic call, "Run, Lindsay, Run" as he broke his chair in the booth. Georgia fans ran with Lindsay that day I am sure. I remember watching that game live on TV. Who knew that moment would become the greatest play in Georgia history? That game would eventually help UGA win the 1980 SEC title and also remain undefeated. Georgia went undefeated during the regular season by defeating all their rivals that season: Georgia Tech, Florida, Ole Miss, Kentucky, Tennessee, Clemson, South Carolina, Auburn, and Vanderbilt. They also beat the current SEC foe Texas A & M and Big 12 TCU. Georgia did defeat one of the greatest programs of all time and was picked to win the game against Notre Dame. UGA won it in an epic back and forth game 17-10 in the Sugar Bowl. Georgia has played Notre Dame two more times since that game and have won both in dramatic fashion. One in South Bend 19-17 in 2017 and 23-17 last year. Georgia is 3-0 against the 'Golden Domers of South Bend.'
   
 Last year's historic game with Notre Dame was epic and drew the largest crowd ever at Dooley Field at Sanford Stadium. I was there to witness that historic game, and it was one of the most electric and loudest scenes I have ever seen. Georgia has had some great seasons since 1980, but nothing has come close to that magic season. Alabama and Clemson have celebrated many titles since that year, but it was a special year for the Dawgs fans. Former head coach Mark Richt had some good teams and came close in 2002 and 2012 with his teams. Richt coached 15 seasons before he was let go and went on to coach at Miami. He is now retired. Richt carried on the Georgia tradition, but never got to the pinnacle. Kirby, hired in 2016, has won a SEC title and played in a national title, but he would like to etch his name into Georgia history as a national champion. COVID-19 has brought many challenges to this season, but right now UGA hopes to add another trophy to the case. You never know, but we will always remember that historic season. With Kirby's recruiting and the defense he has assembled, I think Georgia has a good shot. Georgia is wearing red pants to commemorate that season when they wore red pants. Coach Dooley just turned 88, and I am sure he hopes that UGA would bring home a trophy to add with his. I know Georgia fans are hungry for one, but I think the time is almost here. As the late great Munson once said, "Glory, Glory to ole Georgia!"

Beef herd management is an important topic for anyone preparing for calving season, said Joe Paschal, Texas A&M AgrliLife extension livestock specialist.
 That’s why, like in years past, Paschal will offer a presentation about beef herd management during the 2020 South Texas Farm and Ranch Show. This year, Paschal said he plans to talk about current topics in beef herd management rather than strictly hot topics. Primarily, he plans to discuss winterizing a cow herd.
 “I'll go through making sure the herd is up to date on vaccinations, treated for liver flukes, making sure you evaluate your nutrient supply, maybe getting your hay tested,” he said. “There’s a lot to go through.”
 Paschal said he’ll discuss winterizing for a spring as well as a fall calving herd.
 “So someone that’s like me that’s calving now, I’ll answer, ‘What are some things that I need to do?’” he said. “Be aware of heifers that need assistance with calving, for example.”
 Additionally, Paschal plans to talk about how to make sure the cattle are in good body condition, regardless of what season they are calving, and touch on how to provide adequate nutrition for calves.
 It's an important topic for all to make sure that whenever one's calving season comes around, things go smoothly, Paschal said.
 “It costs a lot of money to run cows,” he said. “Spring and fall calving, nutrition, health and reproduction are all important.”
 Paschal is also the moderator of the Cattleman's College II portion of the Farm and Ranch Show.

 'It is the store's responsibility to refuse any customer who presents a risk and ultimately it is at the discretion of the person serving to decline the sale should they have any doubts or concerns.'
 According to Liquor and Gaming NSW, it is unlawful to buy or obtain alcohol on behalf of a minor on licensed premises. Adults can face fines of up to $11,000 and/or 12 months behind bars if convicted of underage alcohol supply offences.

CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. (WVIR) - Last year, Charlottesville City Schools (CCS) decided to change the format of its gifted learning program by bringing specialists into all classrooms instead of taking selected students out. Now, just a little over a year since it started, the program is having to adjust to online learning.“All of last year, they were working directly in classrooms, so they were going into classrooms to work with students instead of pulling students out," said CCS Instruction Coordinator Beverly Catlin said.Catlin says even though there is no concrete data proving the new format is wielding positive results in the classroom, she has seen the program’s effectiveness first-hand.“Last year when we were working with all the students in classrooms, we saw those talents being developed. We saw students that we might not have noticed in prior years so that’s very exciting and that’s the work that we want to continue to do," Catlin said.While the program was still in its beginning stages, the pandemic hit. Teachers were forced to make some changes when school went 100% virtual.“Our gifted resource teachers are going into those classrooms, still in this virtual environment, and they are offering lessons to all the students in the class, or they may be rotating around to students if they are in breakout rooms or different kinds of groups," Catlin said.The program, like other classes, is facing two big challenges. Making sure children have internet access is the first big hurdle.“We’ve had some face to face contact, parents have come to schools, we’ve gone to houses. Every student has a device, families are working hard to make sure internet access is accessible," Catlin said.Following internet access problems, keeping students engaged also proves challenging. Some children may thrive with the program being all-virtual, while others may struggle.“For the student who may have finished things, then our job is to give them other experiences, some extension, some enrichment that will engage them to want to think farther and go farther with it. For the student who is not quite as engaged, we gotta find that piece that gets them started. How do we hook them into whatever that experience may be?" Catlin said.Despite moving online, Catlin says it could help older learners understand what works best for them in an almost 100% virtual learning environment.“I wonder if this experience is helping each learner have a better understanding of how they learn…and what mode of learning works best for me?”Copyright 2020 WVIR.

So far the turnout has been lopsided, with Democrats outvoting Republicans by a 2-1 ratio in the 42 states included in The Associated Press count. Republicans have been bracing themselves for this early Democratic advantage for months, as they've watched President Donald Trump rail against mail-in ballots and raise unfounded worries about fraud. Polling, and now early voting, suggest the rhetoric has turned his party's rank and file away from a method of voting that, traditionally, they dominated in the weeks before Election Day.

Azerbaijani presidential adviser Hikmet Hajiyev accused Armenia of using ballistic missiles in the attack and said authorities had evidence to support the claim, according to a Twitter post.
 "Let the international community see the barbaric acts of Armenia against civilians," Hajiyev added.
 Video and photos purportedly from the scene showed rescue workers clearing rubble to reach survivors. The prosecutor's office said officials were compiling a complete list of the victims.
 Last weekend, another temporary ceasefire fell apart after weeks of fighting, with the two countries trading accusations of violating the agreement amid reports of casualties.
 France has demanded "an immediate end to hostilities" since fighting broke out between the countries on the morning of September 27.
 The short lived ceasefire last week came after UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet spoke of the suffering the conflict was inflicting on civilians.
 The dispute over Nagorno-Karabakh has run hot and cold since the 1994 ceasefire.
 The region lies within Azerbaijani territory, connected to Armenia proper by a costly highway. It is heavily militarized and its forces have been backed by Armenia, which has a security alliance with Russia.
 Tensions have risen since July, when several days of clashes rocked the border between Armenia and Azerbaijan.
 CNN's Aren Melikyan, Tim Lister and Arzu Geybulla contributed to this report.

During the Grilling JR Podcast, Jim Ross covered the night he was fired in the main event of _Monday Night RAW_ by the McMahon Family. Ross talked about how it wasn't just a on-screen firing in a storyline, it was actually real backstage, and the plan was for Vince to move forward without him on commentary. He explained how upset he was at the time and how much of an emotional rollercoaster his career was on after the day he was fired.      "I knew that I was getting 'futured'," Ross said. "This was more than just an angle on television - this is it. Of course it wasn't it, because 2 years later, I got into the Hall of Fame. Figure that crazy ass journey out! It was just an up and down deal; it was like I was on an emotional rollercoaster. The reality of losing your job was just that - it was reality. It was real."      Linda McMahon was the person on screen who fired Ross on RAW. She came down to the ring, kicked JR in the groin, and fired him while Stephanie and Vince laughed in the background. Ross talked about Linda being hesitant to fire JR, and mentioned how she told him backstage that she wasn't happy about the situation.      "I don't think Linda was either, quite frankly," Ross said. "She just said, 'I'm sorry we're doing this. I didn't want to get involved, but it's what Vince wants, and you know how that goes.' I said, 'I sure do. Don't worry about it. You're just doing your job.'"      Ross also told a story about how he was in intensive care on a Monday, and the week later, he was in the main event of RAW being embarrassed again by Vince. He said there had to have been personal reasons behind being disrespected numerous times live on television, and talked about how his fans always continued to care about him, so that boosted the ratings.      "Again, no explanation, no rational. That's just what he wanted to do," Ross said. "That's why I felt like even though I did what I was instructed to do, I always felt like there was a little bit of personal animosity. That was the second time a skit with JR closed the show 'cause the fans gave a s--t. They still care about me; that's why they watch Wednesday night."      Ross continued to mention how happy he is now to be in AEW and not be with WWE.
 "I'm so happy to be a part of this team at AEW. Tony Khan doesn't have that same mindset. He respects my work, and I think Vince, at some point, didn't really respect my work. I never did understand that. Was it really business or was there some personal seasoning on that deal? I'm of the belief that there was some personal animosity involved in it, and never knowing why."      JR spent 20+ years with WWE and had many different roles, including head of talent relations and the lead commentator on RAW. Ross mentioned how frustrating it was to work with Vince for that long, putting in long hours and get nothing in return. He mentioned how he was the one to sign most of the guys back in the early 2000s: John Cena, Triple H, Randy Orton, etc., and Vince always got the credit.      "I didn't do anything but work my ass off for the guy," Ross said. "Who signed those guys? Vince didn't. I did, because I had a great team. It just was always a head scratcher. I still don't understand it. He kept having to go back and restart things. Hunter even fired me one time. It got to be old.      "I don't need to work. I love to work. It's not a job to me - it's my life. With her gone (his wife) and Tony Khan coming into the picture, it resurrected my career, my spirit."      Ross continued to mention how he wasn't ready to be done commentating in 2005, and he is happy to still be going today. He also said he hopes nobody feels sympathetic for him, and that he's had a fantastic career.      "It was to signify that you're done," Ross said. "That really broke my heart. I'm not ready to be done today. I wasn't ready to be done in 2005. 15 years ago, that was the funeral for JR, and it just didn't take.      "By no means am I asking you to be empathetic to JR. JR made a great living, still is. I'm blessed to be in the pro wrestling business and blessed to have people that still give a damn. At the end of the day, my career has been a blessing more than I ever ever thought it could be. I took [Vince's] money, I earned my money. I'm very blessed and very happy. Nobody's career is perfect."

NELSON COUNTY, Va. (WVIR) - Venues all around the country are continuing to have to find creative ways to get out of the house, and a couple of businesses in Nelson County are doing just that.“When that first guitar strum came out over the speakers yesterday you just saw, everybody that’s in the industry, you just saw their ears kind of perked up,” CEO of Devil’s Backbone Hayes Humphries said.“It’s wonderful that we’ve been able to do the full foliage festival again this year, our response has been amazing,” Brand Manager of Bold Rock Lindsay Dorrier III said.Bold Rock and Devil’s Backbone are two staples of the Nelson County’s Route 151, and they’re also two staples of the Nelson County Music Scene. Now, they’re finding creative ways to get people out of the house safely in a pandemic-stricken world.“It’s basically a regular concert, you can go crazy dance in your box , do whatever you want, we just try to keep everybody contained into their space so that the social distance is maintained," Humphries said."So we feel very blessed that we’ve been able to continue with business but by the same token, it’s taking a lot in order to get to this point,” Dorrier III said.Capacity limits, social distancing requirements, and mask mandates are among some of the changes for concerts and festivals this fall. Both venues say, so far, compliance hasn’t been too much of an issue.“Our customers seem to be abiding by the rules which we’re thankful for,” Dorrier III said.“That makes me proud, you know, people trust what we’re doing, which is a big deal right now,” Humphries said.Devil’s Backbone has been able to pull off a “walk-in concert.”“It is a brand new type of event it’s a socially distanced concert,” Humphries said. “We’ve been seeing a lot of people doing driving shows that sort of thing but we really want people to be able to get out of their cars and enjoy the beautiful scenery around here."Bold Rock was able to organize their annual fall foliage festival abiding by all social distancing guidelines.“I think definitely a little bit of a case of cabin fever, even in the summer months because everyone has been not been able to do the same things that they enjoy so, it’s meaningful to be able to have some sense of normalcy, albeit ensuring that safe environment,” Dorrier III said.They say that it’s just another way businesses along Route 151 are coming together to overcome a challenging year.“We’re not competitors as much as we are partners and creating a great experience for everyone that visits, so we like to make sure that we’re all working as a team to provide that experience,” Dorrier III said.Copyright 2020 WVIR.
