Once television arrived, political strategy shifted even more in the direction of spectacle. RCA had experimented with television broadcasts in the 1930s, but in 1945 there were fewer than 10,000 TV sets in the U.S. By the 1950s, the major broadcast networks - ABC, CBS and NBC - were up and running.

One of the things that stands out as I reflect on my growth is when I’d have success with certain business development activities, somehow, I’d manage to get distracted and deviate from it and pursue another strategy. It is the silliest thing in the world but I think it’s almost human nature to get consumed by distractions. Ultimately, the thing that I have learned most over the years is to stick to the script. If you have a business plan, you have a strategy, just focus on executing that strategy and on things that have proven to yield the greatest results.

“The casino is really for West Michigan,” he continues. “It will bring in economic development and be a big part of growth in West Michigan, affecting the area all along the lakeshore. This project is about job creation for our community.”
 In this regard, Romanelli notes that the casino is anticipating 1,000 – 1,500 high paying full-time jobs and about 1,500 construction and ancillary jobs. For example, it is anticipated that local restaurants, car lots and other businesses will likely have to put on more employees to accommodate the casino’s guests.
 In addition to approximately 69,000 square feet of gaming floor space, 1,700 slot machines and 35 table games, Romanelli explains, “We are bringing in a 220-room hotel, but our studies show the area could accommodate a 600-bed match, so we hope other hotels will also benefit."
 "We will have a food court or venue restaurant, but we will not take over the restaurant business, and our patrons will want to experience fine dining elsewhere. We will have entertainment, but will not compete with the Frauenthal."
 "We will provide meeting space, but other meeting venues will benefit from our presence as well.”
 The casino, which is being built with internal financial resources and no taxpayer dollars, is expected to generate economic development of $15 million in tax revenue for the State of Michigan and millions more for local governments.
 The approval process has been long and complicated. The Tribe filed an application in February 2015 requesting that the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) place 60 acres of land in trust for a $180 million casino and economic development project. The BIA published a Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) in November 2018, followed by a public hearing and comment period.

That’s a very good question. I think I would like to see a movement toward inspiring financial stewardship and a movement toward inspiring generational wealth in the black community. But I think the best way to truly inspire that behavior is to first be the model and example for others to follow. It’s one thing to be told, and another to be shown. Seeing is believing, and I believe our appearance on the show, shined a spotlight on things that can be achieved. We’ve gotten so much overwhelming feedback from people saying what an inspiration our experience on the show has been to them. So, I’m actually inspired to want to continue to be a shining example to others.

"Zoning isn't on the ballot. At this point, the best place to spend everyone's energy in debating the issues on the merits is when new legislators come in in January," said Bronin, former chairwoman of Hartford's Planning and Zoning Commission and an expert in zoning regulations at UConn Law. "I'm more along the lines of, you know, let's convene the conversation when the new legislators come in."

There is definitely a wealth transformation taking place for African Americans. We are now seeing our first generation of Black Billionaires, and we are starting to see that, although we start well behind, there are no limitations on where we can go. You look at what Michael Jordan, Jay Z and Oprah and so many more have done. All have started from humble beginnings and have been shining examples of financial success. They have not only learned to be good businessmen and women but good financial stewards and have made it cool and trendy to establish brands and create generational legacies.

Most recently my wife and I had the pleasure of guest-starring on Bravo’s hit TV series Below Deck Mediterranean. Chartering a Mega yacht was something we had dreamed of and put on our vision board, and as fate would have it, we’d see that dream become a reality. But in all honesty, it was more than what we expected. For those who are not familiar with the show, Below Deck Mediterranean chronicles the experiences of chartering a Mega Yacht in the Mediterranean. We were blessed to have the opportunity to travel to Palma De Mallorca, off the coast of Spain, and have it documented by a film crew for the world to see. It was truly an amazing experience to be able to manifest that dream and make the journey with our closest friends and family.

“Think Danbury and Norwalk Housing Authorities having oversight over Ridgefield,” longtime GOP Rep. John Frey, who is not seeking reelection, wrote on Facebook this month, referring to the possibility that these two racially and economically diverse cities would assume zoning control in Ridgefield, which is largely white and wealthy. “Zoning, or rather the removal of local control, is on the ballot.”
