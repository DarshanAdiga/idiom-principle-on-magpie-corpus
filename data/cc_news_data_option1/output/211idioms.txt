There is no shame in going to a teacher to ask for studying tips and help with content, in fact, it might be the best strategy of all. Teachers know the material better than most students do, so it can be extremely helpful to take advantage of their extra help sessions and hours. Having the extra reinforcement of the material from a teacher can help fill in any missing holes in your notes and study sheets. Also, different teachers have different suggestions for the most efficient way to study for their classes. Therefore, getting tips on how to study for their style of exam, whether it be making flashcards, doing practice problems, or rewriting your notes, can help boost your studying and exam performance. With these three tips in mind, midterms season should seem slightly less stressful and, hopefully, more manageable. Between planning a study/work schedule, getting enough sleep, and making time to see teachers for extra help, students can have an even more successful midterm season. I know this time of year can be overwhelming, so it is pivotal to keep yourself organized and on top of your studying game.

"I think the On the Move program is going to help a lot of kids out."
 Meeker said more than 470 high school students were taking concurrent enrollment classes through Missouri Southern as of Thursday. Of that number, approximately 60 are eligible to qualify for tuition waivers, she said.
 Members of the governing board noted that number could grow as students who might otherwise dismiss concurrent enrollment because of the cost learn about the program.
 The concurrent enrollment tuition rate is $50 per credit hour. In-state undergraduate tuition is $242.96 per credit hour, although that rate also includes a variety of student fees.
 Background
 Concurrent enrollment encompasses both dual credit, in which students take classes for college credit primarily at their high school, and dual enrollment, in which high school students take classes online or at the college.

 E3 is the biggest video game trade show of the year, so when Sony announced that they were skipping last year's event, no press conference and no booths set up so the public and media could get hands-on with their upcoming titles, it was a little surprising.
 Surprising, but at the same time it kind of made sense. Because they showed so much of their lineup early at the 2018 E3 press conference, last year's show would have featured mostly the same titles. And it was much too soon for them to really go into detail about the PlayStation 5 launching this holiday.
 But this year, Sony has a lot to talk about. The PlayStation 5 is coming out this year, and with it will be a new controller, new games, a new online store and a new user interface that gamers are all interested in.
 So when Sony announced earlier this week they were once again skipping E3, I was shocked. The PlayStation 4 has completely dominated this console generation. Although Microsoft hasn't announced Xbox One sales numbers in years, games analysts believe Sony has outsold Microsoft by about 2-1 this generation.
 It might not have been a knockout punch, but Sony landed a huge haymaker against Microsoft at E3 2013 that led the way for PlayStation to recapturing the market lead. At that E3, Microsoft focused their press conference on all the multimedia features of the Xbox One, how it could replace your cable box and be the place you watch movies, TV and live sports. And that it was going to cost $500. Sony followed that up a few hours later focusing on games and announcing a $400 price point.
 It still looks like Microsoft is going to host their press conference at E3 and be on the show floor showing off the Xbox Series X, so more than likely they will dominate the gaming headlines in early June.
 Sony has teased some details about the PlayStation 5 through some exclusive articles with Wired magazine, but my expectation is for them to do a big reveal on the system before E3. The PlayStation 4 was formally announced at an event in February 2013, more details were released that June at E3 and the system launched in November of that year.
 Only time will tell if skipping E3 will end up being a mistake.   Dusty Ricketts is the editor of The Destin Log and The Walton Sun newspapers and can be reached at dricketts@thedestinlog.com.

Northam said it was the right decision.
 “I took this action to protect Virginians from credible threats of violence. These threats are real,” the governor said in a statement, pointing to FBI arrests in Maryland and Delaware of three men, alleged white nationalists or neo-Nazis, discussing plans to head to Richmond armed with guns.
 The Virginia Citizens Defense League and Gun Owners of America, two groups opposing gun control legislation in Virginia, filed a lawsuit Thursday morning against Northam and Capitol Police Chief Steve Pike, whose agency would enforce the ban. The complaint includes three citizen plaintiffs who say they were planning to attend Monday’s rally with their firearms.
 Taylor presided over an emergency hearing Thursday afternoon. She ruled just as court closed for a four-day weekend.
 Late Thursday, the gun-rights groups filed an emergency appeal to the Virginia Supreme Court, arguing that "without relief from this court, petitioners and thousands of other rally participants will be irreparably denied their right to bear arms."
 It would be unusual — though not out of the question — for the state Supreme Court to take up anything before Monday’s rally, according to Carl Tobias, a professor of constitutional law at the University of Richmond. State offices, including courts, will be closed Friday for Virginia’s Lee-Jackson Day and Monday for the holiday honoring the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., which was one reason for the expedited hearing Thursday.
 Northam issued the temporary ban on firearms and other weapons in advance of the rally organized by the VCDL to protest gun control legislation Democratic lawmakers are proposing. Organizers are expecting up to 50,000 people.
 David G. Browne, an attorney who represented the gun-rights groups, said they were asking for a temporary injunction of only the portion of the executive order prohibiting firearms — not other weapons such as bats, sticks, etc.

Whilst the move adds to the heated rivalry between the two clubs, Robinson holds no harsh feelings for the NSW and Australian representative, suggesting that they can't let it distract them as they look for a three-peat.
 “There’s 15 rival clubs and the interest was there,” he said.
 “If you hang onto that then you’re going to miss the other competition that’s in rugby league.”
 Whilst Robinson admitted that the club was aware that Mitchell would likely leave before the end of his contract in 2020, he will always be grateful for what the 22-year-old has achieved throughout his time at the tri-colours.
 “Look we had our time together and we had our conversations so Monday had no effect on me personally, to be honest,” Robinson suggested.
 “We knew where we were at,
 “We knew our time was coming to an end so I’m going to support Latrell for the rest of his career.
 “What he delivered for us in his time here, not only a couple of Premierships it was also an Under 18’s Premiership,
 “That’s not lost, I’ll always remember that but the time’s up.”
 The Roosters will be looking to defend their NRL Nines title when they head to Perth in February for the reinvigorated competition, recruiting Sydney Swans hero Nick Davis to bolster their backline.
 "Nick has been working with our outside backs here at the Roosters for a couple of years now so he knows our game and understands the way we play," Robinson said.
 "He is a natural athlete with a will to win – and he loves a challenge, so we’re looking forward to seeing him switch his Swans guernsey for a Roosters jersey at the NRL Nines.
 "With the Nines being played in Perth, and the Roosters also taking an NRL game to Perth later in the year, we thought that this was a great opportunity to introduce our club to a new audience.
 "He moves well, he moves like a rugby league player,
 "We came back to training (after Christmas) and from then on in, whatever chance we get, he's been jumping in and he's been very good."

ST. BERNARD PARISH, La. (WVUE) - A group of oyster fishermen in St. Bernard Parish wants the U.S. government to compensate them for opening the Bonnet Carre Spillway. They say it’s the Army Corp of Engineer’s fault their oysters died and their reefs were damaged. Though they’re in favor of the spillway openings last year, they’ve filed a lawsuit explaining why they should be paid for it.Oyster boats line the dock near Shell Beach.“I got salt water running through my veins. I love this business. I wouldn’t trade it for anything in the world,” said fourth generation oyster fisherman Robert Campo.Campo has little need for these boats, though, with no crop to harvest.“It’s done. I mean, they’re all dead,” said Campo.His oyster beds and reefs are damaged, too. They haven’t made money for him since the second opening of the Bonne Carre Spillway. Open for more than 100 days, Louisiana Wildlife and Fisheries says the spillway’s freshwater decimated the oyster population and their delicate ecosystem.“Sometime in September is the last time we sold oysters,” said fellow oyster fisherman and oyster broker Kurt Pannagle. “The way things are going now, I don’t think we’ll be back in business for five years.”Pannagle joined Campo in what they hope becomes a class action lawsuit against the US government.“The lawsuit is based on the Takings Clause of the US Constitution which states private property shall not be taken by the government without compensation," started Attorney Camilo Salas. ”Private property being impacted fishermen’s dead oysters and now defunct beds. I think the government should compensate me for this and every other oyster fishermen out there," said Campo. Louisiana Wildlife and Fisheries’ Patrick Banks says sampling showed significant mortality closest to the spillway and less and less as you approached the marshes of St. Bernard.“The impacts to the industry, in general, was heavy but it’s not like every oyster in every spot was killed,” explained Banks.Banks says their monitoring indicates definite improvements in salinity and what he calls recrutiment, or the rebirth of baby oysters, on some of the reefs they watch.“It’s not to the levels that we would hope but we have to remember a lot of the adult oysters did die during this spillway event,” Banks explained. “It may take a while for that resource to really recover.”That’s what these fishermen fear.“What are we gonna do for the next four years?” wondered Campo.Yet Banks doesn't believe it will take that long. He says it only takes two years for an oyster to mature."I think that may be a little bit of a stretch in terms of back in business but certainly a while before they have a stable source of oysters, season after season," he said.Banks says Louisiana submitted a federal grant application, requesting fisheries disaster money. He says that was approved, but it's unclear how much money they'll be awarded. Banks says the plan is to use some of that money to help the oyster industry and restore resources.Fox 8 reached out to the Army Corps of Engineers about the lawsuit. Representatives say they do not comment on pending litigation.Copyright 2020 WVUE. All rights reserved.

TEHRAN, Iran (AP) — Iran's supreme leader will deliver a Friday sermon in Tehran for the first time since 2012, as the Islamic Republic grapples with the fallout from the targeted killing of its top general in a U.S. airstrike and popular anger at its accidental shootdown of a passenger plane. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has held the country's top office since 1989 and has the final say on all major decisions. The 80-year-old leader openly wept at the funeral of Gen. Qassem Soleimani and vowed “harsh retaliation” against the United States. On Jan. 8 Iran launched a barrage of ballistic missiles targeting U.S. troops in Iraq, without causing serious injuries. As Iran's Revolutionary Guard braced for an American counterattack that never came, it mistakenly shot down a Ukrainian jetliner shortly after it took off from Tehran's international airport, killing all 176 passengers on board, mostly Iranians. Authorities concealed their role in the tragedy for three days, initially blaming the crash on a technical problem. Their admission of responsibility triggered days of street protests, which security forces dispersed with live ammunition and tear gas. Tensions between Iran and the United States have steadily escalated since President Donald Trump withdrew the U.S. from Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, which had imposed restrictions on its nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of international sanctions. The White House has since imposed crippling sanctions on Iran, including its vital oil and gas industry, pushing the country into an economic crisis that has ignited several waves of sporadic, leaderless protests. Trump has openly encouraged the protesters — even tweeting in Farsi — hoping that the protests and the sanctions will bring about...

The value of movable assets of Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, who filed his nomination papers for the February 8 Assembly polls on Thursday, has declined by Rs 17,736.
 While his self-acquired immovable properties remained roughly the same as in 2015, worth of his wife's properties increased from Rs 8.70 lakh in 2015 to Rs 65 lakh in 2020.
 In the affidavit filed with the Election Commission, Sisodia, contesting again from the Patparganj seat in east Delhi, said his movable assets were worth Rs 4,74,888 as of January 16, 2020 against Rs 4,92,624 for January 18, 2015.
 The Minister for Education and Finance also said in July 2018, his wife Seema Sisodia, a housewife, purchased a property in Mayur Vihar Phase-2 at Rs 65 lakh.
 In his 2015 affidavit, Sisodia had said his wife had purchased a property in Pandav Nagar in March 2008, costing Rs 8.70 lakh. Interestingly, though the AAP leader was staying in the government accommodation at Mathura Road, he used this property as his postal address in both the affidavits.
 The approximate value of her self-acquired immovable property was Rs 20 lakh in 2015. In the 2020 affidavit, he said the approximate market value of the self-acquired immovable property of his wife was Rs 65 lakh.
 Sisodia had stated in his 2015 affidavit that he had bought a property in Vasundhara, Ghaziabad, at Rs 5.07 lakh in April 2001. The approximate market value of the self-acquired immovable property in 2015 was Rs 12 lakh.
 In his 2020 affidavit, he mentioned the same property. But the approximate market value of self-acquired immovable property in 2020 jumped to Rs 21 lakh.
 While he owned a Maruti Swift (a 2013 model) in 2015, he or his family don't own any vehicle, as per his 2020 affidavit.
 Also, the gold holding of Seema Sisodia remained unchanged at 50 grams.

September 30, 1931 January 15, 2020 Faye Adamson Hundley was born on September 30, 1931, in Roanoke, and went to be with her Lord on Wednesday, January 15, 2020. A longtime resident of Botetourt County, at 4'11, Faye was short in stature but big in personality. She graduated from Fincastle High School, where she was a cheerleader, member of the Spanish Club, Chorale, and Phi Beta Kappa. She first caught her husband's "ear" as a cheerleader and he long joked that he could "hear her before he saw her and fell in love with her voice." Raymond and Faye were married for 68 years before Raymond's death in November 2017 and raised four children together on a large farm in Eagle Rock. Faye loved her family, nature, and her community. Her love of family was apparent in her dedication to her sons' Boy Scout troop #2, (one of the oldest in the country). She worked tirelessly to ensure they all earned their Eagle Scout honors (though all she got was bragging rights and a pin). She was just as passionate about her daughter's time in 4-H and was a volunteer leader for Eagle Rock 4-H for nearly two decades. Over the years, she went on many trips with her children, visiting National Parks out west, Canada, and the beach. The beach was always her favorite place and the childlike wonder in her eyes as she played in the waves, well into her 80's, never dimmed. Faye's love of nature was seen in her numerous pets over the years, including dogs, cats, skunks, fawns, owls and more. She was a gracious hostess who became "Grandma Hunny" to everyone she met, inviting them to the farm for camping, playing in the swimming hole, and making s'mores. In sharing family stories, someone said with a grin, "Faye is Faye"! In the community, Faye was a dedicated member of Galatia Presbyterian Church, acting out her faith in all aspects of her life. At Galatia, she was an Elder, directed the youth group, and taught Sunday School for many years. Faye also volunteered for the PTA and the Eagle Rock Gardening Club; as well as serving as an election poll volunteer and Alleghany Hospital volunteer. Faye had a strong moral compass and the force of her beliefs were apparent if she felt something was unethical. Faye was preceded in death by her husband, Raymond E. Hundley Jr.; sister, Joe Anna Bolton; and parents, Cordelia C. and Cleveland W. Adamson. She lives on through her children, Robert, Ridge, Stephen, and Melissa Hundley; brother, Pete Adamson; seven grandchildren; and four great-grandchildren. She will be dearly missed. The family will receive friends from 4 until 6 p.m. on Saturday, January 18, 2020 at Galatia Presbyterian Church. A service of celebration of her life will be held at the church at 3 p.m. on Sunday, January 19, 2020. In lieu of flowers, memorials may be given to Eagle Rock Fire & Rescue Department, PO Box 234, Eagle Rock, VA 24085. Online condolences may be made at www.botetourtfuneralhome.com.

 Giants Manager Gabe Kapler, who was hired in November, added Nakken and Mark Hallberg to his staff on Thursday, the team announced. Kapler said they will help build a winning culture in the clubhouse.
 "In every organization, environment affects performance, and baseball clubhouses are no different," Kapler said. "That's why in addition to assisting the rest of the coaching staff on the field, Mark and Alyssa will focus on fostering a clubhouse culture that promotes high performance through, among other attributes, a deep sense of collaboration and team."

Alyssa Nakken, who played softball at Sacramento State University, has been added to the San Francisco Giants coaching ranks, making her the first woman on a Major League Baseball coaching staff.
 The 29-year-old Nakken joined the Giants as an intern in the baseball operations department in 2014.
 Giants manager Gabe Kapler told the Sacramento Bee newspaper that Nakken would work with players on throwing batting practice and base running.
 She is currently responsible for organizing many of the Giants health and wellness initiatives.
 San Francisco also added Mark Hallberg to the staff. Hallberg, 34, served as manager of the Class A Salem-Keizer farm team last season.
 “Alyssa and Mark are highly respected members of the Giants and I’m delighted that they will now focus their talents on helping to build a winning culture in the clubhouse,” Kapler said.
 “In every organization, environment affects performance, and baseball clubhouses are no different.”
 In her US college softball career, Nakken hit 19 home runs in 184 games with Sacramento.

IRONTON — A Huntington man was sentenced to from six to nine years in prison Wednesday in Lawrence County Common Pleas Court for his role in the armed robbery of the Dollar General store west of Chesapeake last year.
 Jason C. Addison, 19, of the 2600 block of Adams Avenue, Huntington, was indicted earlier this year on charges of aggravated robbery with a gun specification, tampering with evidence and resisting arrest. A co-defendant received a similar sentence earlier this year from Judge Christen Finley.
 Addison was given credit for 208 days already spent behind bars toward the prison sentence.
 In an unrelated case, Cheryl L. Tilley, 49, of Chillicothe, Ohio, was sentenced by Finley to 30 months in prison after pleading guilty to aggravated possession of meth. Tilley could be eligible for early release from prison after serving six months in prison.

Remembering recently deceased physician
   
 Thanks to the Savannah Morning News for your report on the death of Dr. Irving Victor.
   
 Dr, Victor was a friend of mine as he was to countless others. The positive influence he had on this community is too broad to chronicle here. And I don't believe enough can be said about the importance of Victor in the process of establishing the local emergency medical response we have today.
   
 Victor was relentless in his efforts in the 1970s to help train professional EMTs and equip them with life-saving techniques. Hundreds and perhaps thousands of lives have been saved because of his foresight.

 Economic literacy testing vital for students
   
 Are Georgia's public schools adequately preparing most students for their economic roles as productive workers, informed consumers and savers, involved citizens and lifelong decision makers in a globally interdependent world? Because of long-established course and testing requirements, the answer to that important question, for now, is yes.
   
 Since 1981, high school students in Georgia have been required to pass an economics course as a core graduation requirement. Georgia is now one of a handful of states requiring students to take an economics course that is accompanied by standardized testing requirements.
   
 Regrettably, the Georgia Department of Education is considering eliminating the testing requirement that measures students' proficiency in high school economics -- a short-sighted decision that would negatively impact teachers' ability statewide to assess their students' economic and financial literacy acumen.
   
 Everyone in business knows that what gets measured gets managed. Similarly, in education, what is tested is prioritized in terms of professional development opportunities, teacher quality and resources. In our resource limited school systems can we truly justify de-emphasizing courses that teach basic economic principles and personal financial literacy?
   
 If we falter in this effort, our students and our state will pay a price we can ill afford. Our credible claim that Georgia is truly the best state in the nation for business development will diminish and companies will invest in those places where educators prepare their students for the world as it exists and is evolving.

 Executive director

LAKE OSWEGO, Ore. — Legislation aimed at fixing some of agriculture's deepening labor woes would actually do little to benefit farms in the long term, according to attorney Leon Sequeira, a former assistant secretary of labor under President George W. Bush.
 Sequeira said the Farm Workforce Modernization Act, which passed the House on Dec. 11, has flaws that make it unlikely to pass the Republican-controlled Senate.
 Sequeira spoke Jan. 16 at the Wafla H-2A Workforce Summit in Lake Oswego, Ore.
 Lawmakers, led by Reps. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., and Dan Newhouse, R-Wash., introduced the Farm Workforce Modernization Act last year. It provides a pathway for immigrant farmworkers to gain legal status in the U.S., while proposing key changes to the country's H-2A visa program.
 Wafla, a farm labor association based in Olympia, Wash., has opposed the bill, arguing it will make the H-2A program more expensive and prone to litigation without solving worker shortages.
 Sequeira highlighted those concerns during his presentation, beginning with the bill's mechanism for worker legalization. Under the bill, farmworkers can apply for legal status as a "Certified Agricultural Worker" if they claim 180 days of agricultural work over the last two years.
 Workers can then renew that status every five years if they claim at least 100 days of agricultural work per year. But Sequeira said the bill has virtually no verification standards for checking claims, and after fulfilling their minimum hours workers can quit and go on to other jobs.
 "(The bill) does a great job of providing legal status for agricultural workers," Sequeira said. "It really doesn't do anything to solve the labor problems in agriculture."
 As for H-2A changes, the bill does offer a few positives, such as streamlining applications online and capping the minimum wage rate increases for H-2A workers at 4.25% over the next 10 years, he said.
 However, Sequeira said it does nothing to limit higher prevailing wages in states such as Washington, where a $16 per hour minimum wage was recently imposed on some apple harvesting activity.
 "This is a huge problem in Washington state," he said.
 Sequeira said the bill does allow growers access to H-2A workers year-round, though it initially caps the number of visas at 20,000 per year, half of which are reserved for dairy. The Department of Labor issued 200,000 H-2A visas in 2019.
 Perhaps the biggest issue with the bill, Sequeira said, is it allows farmworkers to sue employers in federal court over alleged program violations, creating a massive legal liability for farmers. Taxpayer-funded legal aid groups could also represent foreign clients and sue farms.
 "This is really just a horrendous element of this bill that nobody talks about," Sequeira said. "It's a lawyer's dream. It's not too great for you, if you're trying to survive."
 Finally, the bill would also phase in mandatory use of E-Verify to check workers' eligibility, but for agricultural employers only.
 Sequeira said it is highly unlikely the Senate will take up the bill, though a small group of senators led by Thom Tillis, R-N.C., is discussing possibly drafting an alternative.
 With a divided Congress and election year on the horizon, he said it remains to be seen whether anything will happen soon.
 "There's always a chance. It can be solved," Sequeira said. "But it's a politically difficult issue."

"We want students to feel 'On the Move' upward toward better things," she said, referencing the formal name of the initiative. "It's moving toward equity in concurrent enrollment."
 By waiving tuition for eligible students, Missouri Southern hopes to eliminate disparities among schools, the poorer and smaller of which may not be able to hire the types of faculty members required to teach dual credit classes, Meeker said. Offering a program such as On the Move will provide the same access to college-level courses to all high school students who meet the academic criteria to enroll, regardless of which school district they attend — or even which state they live in.
 "We're trying to erase all of those issues," she said.
 The initiative is an effective way not only to recruit students to Missouri Southern but also to improve the education base of the state's future employees and leaders, said Paula Carson, provost and vice president for academic affairs.
 "We believe it's the good and right thing to do for the citizens of Missouri," she said. "If we can work with the high schools to show students who perhaps have never in their wildest imagination thought that they would go to or succeed in college ... and increase that self-efficacy, we feel like in the long term we're doing a really good job with the social and economic development of the state."

HUNTINGTON — Marshall sophomore Taevion Kinsey looked to the heavens as time ran off the clock of Thursday night’s 77-75 loss to Charlotte at Cam Henderson Center.
 Kinsey had just connected on a 3-pointer from beyond half-court that left the Thundering Herd one basket short as the 49ers celebrated the road victory to remain undefeated in men’s Conference USA basketball.
 The shot capped a 29-point performance for Kinsey, but there was no solace as the Herd dropped its second-consecutive Conference USA matchup and fell to 8-10 on the season and 2-3 in Conference USA.
 In fact, it almost made Kinsey even more furious.
 “It’s a tough one, man,” Kinsey said. “We’ve got to keep fighting. (There’s) definitely got to be some fire in us. I don’t see enough fight right now.”
 Perhaps the most frustrating aspect for Kinsey and fellow guard Jarrod West, who added 18 points and five assists to complement Kinsey’s performance, is that — in their mind — the Herd didn’t play well at all offensively, but was still within just one possession of the Conference USA league leader.
 Marshall head coach Dan D’Antoni praised Kinsey and West for their performances and said the Herd is close to being one of the league’s best, but it will take more guys with the attitude of his two leaders to push the Herd over the top.
 “I’ve got two warriors, I know that, in Taevion and Jarrod,” D’Antoni said. “We’ve got to get some people playing and moving their game up to the competitive level.”
 While Marshall struggled to find guys to aid Kinsey and West, Charlotte (10-5, 4-0 C-USA) had no such issues, getting key contributions from role players, which provided the cushion for the win.
 The biggest contribution came from Amidou Bamba down low as he tied for the team lead in points (16) and rebounds (6) while out-scrapping Marshall’s post presence of Iran Bennett and Goran Miladinovic, who combined to go 3 of 10 from the floor with only six combined rebounds — one defensive.
 “They’re so big and long on the interior that we did not know that was going to be an area where we’d be able to benefit tonight,” Charlotte coach Ron Sanchez said. “I think Bamba did a great job of playing around the basket.”
 Bamba’s efficiency forced Marshall’s defense to also pay more attention to him, which opened the floor for Jahmir Young and Jordan Shepherd to work, which paid dividends during a crucial 8-2 run in the second half.
 Marshall cut the lead to 54-49 on a basket by Kinsey off an inbounds play, but Young scored five straight and Shepherd completed a three-point play at the rim, which ballooned the lead back out to double digits, where it stayed until just 90 seconds remained in the game.
 Young also finished with 16 points and six rebounds while Shepherd added 14 in the win.

E3 is the biggest video game trade show of the year, so when Sony announced that they were skipping last year's event, no press conference and no booths set up so the public and media could get hands-on with their upcoming titles, it was a little surprising.      Surprising, but at the same time it kind of made sense. Because they showed so much of their lineup early at the 2018 E3 press conference, last year's show would have featured mostly the same titles. And it was much too soon for them to really go into detail about the PlayStation 5 launching this holiday.      But this year, Sony has a lot to talk about. The PlayStation 5 is coming out this year, and with it will be a new controller, new games, a new online store and a new user interface that gamers are all interested in.      So when Sony announced earlier this week they were once again skipping E3, I was shocked. The PlayStation 4 has completely dominated this console generation. Although Microsoft hasn't announced Xbox One sales numbers in years, games analysts believe Sony has outsold Microsoft by about 2-1 this generation.      It might not have been a knockout punch, but Sony landed a huge haymaker against Microsoft at E3 2013 that led the way for PlayStation to recapturing the market lead. At that E3, Microsoft focused their press conference on all the multimedia features of the Xbox One, how it could replace your cable box and be the place you watch movies, TV and live sports. And that it was going to cost $500. Sony followed that up a few hours later focusing on games and announcing a $400 price point.      It still looks like Microsoft is going to host their press conference at E3 and be on the show floor showing off the Xbox Series X, so more than likely they will dominate the gaming headlines in early June.      Sony has teased some details about the PlayStation 5 through some exclusive articles with Wired magazine, but my expectation is for them to do a big reveal on the system before E3. The PlayStation 4 was formally announced at an event in February 2013, more details were released that June at E3 and the system launched in November of that year.      Only time will tell if skipping E3 will end up being a mistake.   Dusty Ricketts is the editor of The Destin Log and The Walton Sun newspapers and can be reached at dricketts@thedestinlog.com.

An Ironton service dog has been providing much needed love and distractions to Puerto Ricans currently suffering the aftereffects of being hit with a spate of earthquakes over the past month.
 Eight-year-old Barkley, a rat terrier, lives with his family, splitting time between Ironton and Cabo Rojo, Puerto Rico, and has been traveling from town to town providing comfort to those in need. He is the service dog for Greg Hudson, who said he bought a condo in Puerto Rico to spend half the year there because he got tired of celebrating cold birthdays.
 Barkley is trained in compassion and identifying low blood sugar spells for those living with diabetes.
 Hudson said Barkley got his start in bringing comfort to others when he took Barkley to a hospital in Ashland to visit an ailing family member and was asked to take him to visit the children’s ward after seeing the joy he brought to the family member.
 Trained from a young age, Hudson says Barkley can remember people’s names, back flip and do several tricks involving a hula-hoop. His mother won a national first-place award for obedience and his father was the 2009 champion for an agility course, so being a good boy is in his blood.
 “He’s full of wisdom,” Hudson said.
 The island has been hit with more than 1,280 earthquakes in recent weeks. More than two dozen of them have been magnitude 3.5 or greater. At least one was a 6.4 magnitude that hit Jan. 7 and a 5.9 magnitude aftershock that occurred Saturday.
 Government officials have estimated damage so far to be $110 million, which includes more than 550 damaged or destroyed homes. Scientists have been on the island investigating the cause of the uptick in quakes. While not uncommon, the area previously has not experienced this much activity.
 Puerto Rico had experienced more than a dozen earthquakes Wednesday ranging from 2 to 4.3 magnitude. While the epicenters were 10 to 30 miles from Hudson’s home, they still created major and minor damage around the south and west side of the island.
 Hudson said he can feel quakes in the 4 to 5 range. During the most severe quake, a few of his belongings were broken — like a dish and flower pots — and his condo’s pool had water sloshing all over the place, he said.
 Hudson said he also has experienced phantom earthquakes, which he said occur when anxiety is elevated and your heartbeat and pulse can make your body feel like a quake is occurring.
 Barkley sometimes alerts him of upcoming quakes — about 10 seconds in advance because dogs can experience them before humans, he said — but has gotten used to them at this point because they are so numerous.
