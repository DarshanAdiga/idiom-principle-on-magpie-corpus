“What normally happens is many of the people who book the early season trips are guys who are going to fish twice a year — in April it's trout then they come back later in the year to fish salmon,” Capt. Yablonsky said.
 “We only have so many days to do what we do. If things keep going the way that they are, it's gonna be tough.”
 Another veteran local charter fishing boat business owner, “Team Thrillseeker” Capt. Vince Pierleoni in Olcott, has been navigating his boat out to some Lake Ontario hot spots as well as the Lower Niagara river for more than three decades.
 Capt. Pierleoni said charter fishing boat captains can't just turn their businesses on and off like a light switch.
 “It's going to take some time. Everything's scheduled. You have schedules and they have schedules. They can't just call up and say, ‘Okay, I'm coming on such and such a date.’ ”
 Capt. Pierleoni thinks it's imperative that the state and national economy get restarted before it's too late.
 “If you're relying on income, this is devastating,” Capt. Pierleoni said. “It's devastating to convenient stores, it's devastating to bars and restaurants, so many businesses — so much that it trickles down. Unfortunately, we're getting lumped in with New York City. I'd like to see New York City put their big pants on and open up. At some point we gotta get our economy back up and running again or this country is gonna go down the tubes. You gotta let the producers produce.”

Resource crunch and consequent hurdles faced in clearing treasury bills in time may prompt the government to defer its plan to impose stringent norms on local self-government institutions for carrying over their unspent funds to the next financial year.
 The local bodies had set a remarkable record in Plan fund absorption and project execution in the current year and were surging to register even more impressive gain by April 2018. But the dip in tax collection and the Central government laxity in stepping in to arm the State for plugging tax evasion and augmenting tax collection, led to an inevitable resource crunch, resulting in treasury payment restrictions.
 The financial crisis has also affected treasury payments due to local governments. It has virtually become impossible for them to sustain the tempo in making use of the allocated funds and attain the target by the year end. Hence, the government may have to defer its plans to do away with the provision for carrying over the unspent funds to the next financial year, sources said.
 Local governments are looking forward to pick up the steam in project execution once the crisis blows over by January. It may fall short of the expected levels, but still would be able to avoid bunching of projects to a considerable extent, much better than the previous years.
 Moreover, the Plan allocation for 2018-19 has been enhanced from the size in the current year. Against the allocation of ₹6,227 crore in the current year, it has been fixed at ₹7,000 crore, about 24% more, in line with the State Finance Commission’s recommendation for a annual increase.
 Local bodies have already been directed to streamline the planning process from the next financial year and guidelines will be issued to help them integrate budget and Plan from the next financial year.
 Such steps as well as a host of other initiatives such as integration of district Plans with the State Plan that are progressing in full swing are expected to improve the overall performance of local bodies. The reforms initiated in this score were expected to help the local governments improve their fund absorption rate so that it would be able to impose stringent norms for carrying over unspent funds soon, sources said.

Neymar believes Barcelona will win the Club World Cup despite having failed to claim a victory from their last three matches.
 The Spanish champions have drawn their last three games in all competitions after being held 2-2 by Deportivo La Coruna at Camp Nou on Saturday - a game Neymar missed due to a thigh injury.
 Barca face a trip to Yokohama in Japan to face Chinese side Guangzhou Evergrande Taobao in the Club World Cup semi-finals, and Neymar is in no doubt that his teammates have the quality to secure the club’s third Club World Cup title.
 "It is a good opportunity, and a dream for any player to win the Club World Cup," he said.
 "If we keep doing what we've done, we are going back with the title for sure.
 "The good thing about our team is that everybody likes to win and always wants to win and improve. We never settle."
 Speaking to Globoesporte, Neymar aslo reflected on a positive 2015 for him personally, and spoke about the challenge of playing without Lionel Messi, who recently returned from a six-week knee injury lay-off.
 "From a young age, I have always taken responsibility," said Neymar. "Messi has not been in recent games, but we did not assume that we have enough players to avoid noticing his absence.
 "We all have a responsibility in the team. Playing for Barcelona is not the same as being at another club. It is difficult to adjust. Not anyone can do it.
 "I think that, since January, I'm having a good season."

The Rochester Museum & Science Center will open "The Changemakers: Rochester Women Who Changed the World" on Oct. 9 in the third-floor Riedman Gallery.   This community-curated exhibition aims to inspire and empower the community by sharing stories of regional innovators.   "RMSC holds robust collections from Rochester's history, and has the unique capability to tell the stories of these innovators and changemakers in a way that engages, excites and informs all visitors," said Hillary Olson, president and CEO. "The museum is thrilled to make history come alive in this dynamic exhibition."   "The Changemakers" will share compelling, authentic and often untold narratives of more than 100 regional and Haudenosaunee women. The exhibition celebrates historical and contemporary women from the Rochester region and sovereign Haudenosaunee Confederacy.   To effectively tell these stories, staff at RMSC included the community throughout the planning and curation process.   "We wanted 'The Changemakers' to go beyond the standard narrative to highlight the life and work of women whose stories haven't always been celebrated," said Kathryn Murano Santos, senior director of collections and exhibitions. "Historic and contemporary women of all backgrounds have made really important contributions that impact all aspects of our lives, and it's critical to acknowledge that in public spaces like museums. By partnering with a diverse group of community members to shape all aspects of the exhibition -- from the concept to the unveiling of the final product -- everyone will be able to see themselves in this exhibition."   To ensure the new exhibition has equitable and authentic representation of the entire community, RMSC asked community members to join its newly formed Exhibit Development Committee. This group had a hand in all aspects of the planning process, including determining what stories to tell, what women to feature and how each story should be represented in the exhibition.   "Being involved in 'The Changemakers' community curation process has been especially satisfying to me," said Rachel DeGuzman, CEO of 21st Century Arts. "I am often called upon to share my expertise regarding equity in the arts, and the processes and outcomes don't always reflect diversity and inclusion. In this case, both the staff and diverse members of the community embraced an equitable and fluid process which, if more widely adopted, will be a game- changer."   RMSC sought help from diversity and inclusion consultants representing Haudenosaunee, African American and Latinx communities. Consultants guided the selection process of the featured women to ensure the stories chosen are representative of the Rochester community.   "The way in which we diversity consultants were able to share our knowledge and expertise -- which augmented the earlier work done by the community-based Take It Down Planning Committee -- helped change everyone's mind about what the exhibition should look like," said Irma McClaurin, anthropologist and owner of Irma McClaurin Solutions. "Our work as diversity and inclusion consultants is necessary to help change the behavior of museums that have relied solely upon its own experts, who historically have been white. Through this profound collaboration, I believe we have created a unique and transformative exhibition on women. It will serve as a beacon of hope and a concrete example of the power and necessity of weaving diversity, equity and inclusion into every aspect of society."   To further expand diversity and inclusion efforts, staff members and committees sought help and guidance from women within Rochester's Asian community. RMSC worked with more than 15 local organizations and over 50 individuals from the community to help bring "The Changemakers" to life.   "The exhibit development process has been rich, dynamic and eye-opening, because of the multitude of the perspectives included," Murano Santos said. "This collaboration with community curators and diversity and inclusion consultants will ensure the exhibition inspires and empowers all visitors to become changemakers."

 "Typically what happens (is) I go to curbside at HEB and I pick up the groceries and when I'm on their way to their house or apartment I would text them, 'I'm on my way to your house, I'll be there in however many minutes,'" he explained.

Sinisa Mihajlovic is optimistic about AC Milan's chances of going far in the Coppa Italia after they reached the quarter-final at the expense of Sampdoria on Thursday.
 Goals from M'Baye Niang and Carlos Bacca helped Milan to a 2-0 win at the Stadio Luigi Ferraris to set up a last-eight meeting with Carpi.
 Mihajlovic is confident Milan can make it to the final.
 "Reaching the final certainly isn't impossible and would give a different meaning to the season," the Milan coach said at a news conference.
 "Thursday's win should give us more confidence and shows that we never give in. We simply had to win and we achieved what we came to do. It was a big chance and we took it.
 "The run to the final is certainly within our reach and Thursday's win is a confidence boost for our league campaign too. We showed great character.
 "We should have sealed the win earlier, but I am pleased with the team. We gave away very little and were solid. It’s a big win and I hope it gives us self-confidence and enthusiasm. We’re all aware that Milan can and must do better.
 "We have a great chance to go all the way to the final, but nothing is definite in football. Far from it. But the players have to take this opportunity we have been presented."
 Milan will meet the winner of the quarter-final between Spezia and Alessandria in the final four if they manage to see off Carpi.

Valencia head coach Gary Neville says he knows his new team are going to get better and better in 2016.
 The former Manchester United defender will lead his charges against Getafe in La Liga on Saturday, his first top-flight clash at Mestalla since taking the helm.
 Valencia are eighth in the table, seven points adrift of the top four, but Neville feels he has already seen enough in his first three games in charge to see signs of major potential.
 "I said to you a week ago I feel relaxed and I still feel relaxed – I hope that is the same in a month's time," he said at his pre-match media conference.
 "I just know that we are going to get better and better. I know that the players are going to improve.
 "I know they are going to improve physically. I know that they are going to improve tactically. I know that they are going to improve from an understanding point of view of what I know of them, what they know of me and what we want from each other."
 Neville is eager to see a positive performance against Getafe with a 12-day gap to follow the game until they meet Villarreal on December 31.
 "The wishes for New Year, from a professional side it is all about the game against Getafe, for us to play well, get a good result," the 40-year-old added.
 "Obviously Getafe wants the same thing as us so we will have to be aware of that.
 "I think that my main priority and all my focus is on the game on Saturday and making sure we prepare well for that. That will be the best Christmas present and New Year's wishes that I could have and obviously I am sure the Valencia fans and players think the same.
 "I know that we have got areas to improve, the players know that, no one is sitting here saying that we are the finished article and that we do not have improvements to make.
 "What we are seeing I think is moments in games that I like and moments that the players would like. But I think that to get a sustained performance over a large period of the game is always the intent of every coach and every team. I think at this moment in time, that is what we have got to search for."
 Valencia did the double over Getafe last season, winning 1-0 at home and 3-0 on the road.

South Korean voters wore masks and moved slowly between lines of tape at polling stations on Wednesday to elect lawmakers in the shadows of the spreading coronavirus.
 The government resisted calls to postpone the parliamentary elections billed as a midterm referendum for President Moon Jae-in, who enters the final years of his term grappling with a historic public health crisis that is unleashing massive economic shock.
 While South Korea’s electorate is deeply divided along ideological and generational lines and regional loyalties, recent surveys showed growing support for Moon and his liberal party, reflecting the public’s approval of an aggressive test-and-quarantine program so far credited for lower fatality rates compared to worst-hit areas in China, Europe and North America.
 The long lines that snaked around public offices and schools followed record- high participation in early voting held on Friday and Saturday, seemed to defy expectations of low voter turnout in the middle of an active campaign to minimize social contact to slow infections.
 Around 87,000 of South Korea’s 172,000 eligible voters overseas were also denied absentee voting after polling was ruled out in dozens of diplomatic offices worldwide as the pandemic grew.
 The voting in South Korea draws contrast with an upended election cycle in the United States, where some states pushed back presidential primaries or switched to voting by mail.
 To hold the parliamentary elections as scheduled, South Korean election officials and health authorities drew up a deliberate set of preventive measures to reduce risks of the virus being transmitted.
 Duct tape or stickers marked a meter (3 feet) of social-distancing space from nearby streets to ballot booths. Masked poll workers checked temperatures of arrivals and whisked anyone with a fever or not wearing a mask to separate areas to vote, sanitizing the facilities after they do. Voters who passed the fever screening got sanitizing gel and disposable plastic gloves before entering booths to cast their ballots.
 The government also mapped out a voting process for citizens quarantined at their homes, a number that ballooned after the country began enforcing two- week quarantines on all arrivals from overseas on April 1.
 Officials texted eligible voters in self-quarantine before the vote and about 13,000 affirmed they wanted to participate. Those without fever or respiratory symptoms can temporarily leave their homes from 5:20 to 7 p.m. so they could cast their ballots after 6 p.m., when polling stations close for other voters.
 Quarantined voters will be escorted or monitored through tracking apps and must maintain a 2-meter (6 feet) distance at polling places, while workers fully dressed in protective suits will disinfect booths after each of them vote.
 Hospitalized virus patients were able to vote by mail if they had applied. Around 400 mildly ill patients participated in early voting.
 South Korea has confirmed more than 10,500 infections with new cases declining in recent weeks. But there’s concern about rising infections in the densely populated Seoul metropolitan area and worries that crowds at parks and on mass transportation may indicate a relaxing of social distancing.
 “Please do exercise your valuable rights by voting, but also refrain from other gatherings or activities that involve multiple people in confined spaces,” Health Ministry official Yoon Tae-ho said.
 South Korea is just three years removed from mass protests that led to the ouster of Moon’s corrupt predecessor, but public displays of its dynamic democracy were muted this year by the virus. Candidates, wearing masks and gloves, avoided large rallies and handshakes. Things were more heated on the internet, which overflowed with bitter exchanges between supporters of Moon and his conservative opponents, who accuse the government of economic and foreign policy failures and botching the financial response to the epidemic.
 Before the virus began absorbing public attention, Moon saw his support falter over a decaying job market, corruption scandals surrounding key political allies and an ambitious but fragile diplomacy with rival North Korea that’s falling apart.
 Moon held three summits with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in 2018, but the North in recent months severed virtually all cooperation with the South amid a stalemate in larger nuclear negotiations with the United States. The North has also been dialing up weapons tests and fired a barrage of missiles into the sea on Tuesday.
 A ruling party victory will likely embolden Moon to drive his key domestic and foreign policies, including resuming inter-Korean cooperation and inducing U.S.-North Korea talks, said Duyeon Kim, a senior adviser at the Brussels- based International Crisis Group.
 “If the opposition wins, Moon will likely become a lame duck, and party politics will quickly pivot to preparing for the 2022 presidential elections,” she said.

A Mass Rapid Transport System (MRTS) may be on the cards for Hyderabad with a government agency setting in motion the process of identifying a project consultant for the MRTS Corridor connecting Minotaur, Shilaparamam and Gachibowli.
 The corridor under consideration is expected to boost connectivity to the IT hub and some fast-developing areas in the western parts of the city. It will complement the existing MMTS that fans into various parts of the city from Lingampally, and the Metro Rail network.
 The Telangana government “stresses the need for continuing efforts... recognising the varying needs and priorities of different transportation users, in developing HITEC City’s major transportation infrastructure,” says the call for RFP from Telangana State Industrial Infrastructure Corporation (TSIIC) for a project consultant.
 The consultant would assist the TSIIC in selection of MRTS corridor and undertake analysis to demonstrate the techno-economic and financial viability of the corridor... “to satisfy the future travel demand... to ensure that this is well integrated with other transport networks/terminals and land use.”
 The MRTS is expected to be an alternative mode for handling the “relatively higher demands compared to road-based public transport and relieving the traffic congestion on the road system,” the TSIIC document said.
 In support of MRTS, it said though the GHMC had successfully initiated the Sustainable Road Development Plan to ease traffic congestion in the central area of HITEC City, “these will be temporary measures to relieve the traffic congestion.”
 The consultant needs to undertake an analysis of the various alignments for the MRTS corridor, “review the connections of the proposed road and transit facilities in the multi-modal connectivity from Miyapur to Shilparamam and Gachibowli... carry out a rigorous evaluation of alternatives alignments, including identification of intermediate stations.”
 An assessment of preliminary requirement for preferred alternative by undertaking a transport modelling work for 2021, 2031 and 2041 horizon years is another task required of the consultant.
 They also ought to suggest the project implementation mechanism/project structure and procurement assistance, including preparation of RFP document, development agreement and bid process management.
 The call for project consultants by the TSIIC comes in the backdrop of Industries and IT Secretary Jayesh Ranjan announcing last month that work towards having a mono rail in the IT hub had been initiated. Gachibowli, Nanakramguda, Financial District and new areas in the neighbourhood such as Tellapur and Kokapet would be connected by Mono Rail. The “project will be happening soon,” he had declared.

PLYMOUTH - The change was both dramatic and swift. In the blink of an eye Nicole Quinn went from the last line of defense on the UMass Dartmouth women's lacrosse team to the first line of offense in the battle against the coronavirus pandemic.
 "This recent time has seen some incredible changes at my work because of what we are facing," said Quinn, 22, a college senior as well as a certified nursing assistant in the dementia unit at Life Care Center of Plymouth. "But it hasn't changed me from wanting a career in the medical field. What I've seen has just strengthened my desire to want to help people."
 Quinn's known her chosen career path for some time now. She was part of the allied health program at Plymouth North and earned her CNA license before graduating in 2016. The UMass Dartmouth senior is taking online classes right now and she'll finish up next month with a degree in Biology/Pre-Med.
 Quinn has worked at Life Care since 2015 but nothing could have prepared her for the changes she's seen just in the last few months at the medical facility, with the added precautions in place since the coronavirus pandemic struck. She has her temperature taken as soon as walks in the front door of the building and "our masks are on 24/7."
 "This is a scary time for a lot of the people I work with every day. There's no visitors allowed right now, so they keep asking when they'll be able to see their families once again," Quinn said. "The families can come to window and wave hi, but it's still pretty hard on everyone. We all do our best to keep everyone comfortable and entertained and take all this day by day."
 Sports have always played a huge part in Quinn's day-to-day existence. She ran cross-country, and played ice hockey and lacrosse at Plymouth North. Quinn would focus solely on lacrosse as she headed off to UMass Dartmouth.
 "Sports were incredibly huge for me, especially in college as a way to make new friends. When you are part of a sports team in college you are essentially part of a new family because of all the time you spend together during a given season," Quinn said. "You go off to college not knowing anyone, but with your team you have an instant family that you can lean on and that helps take care of you."
 Quinn was just beginning her senior season as a starting defenseman for the Corsairs when the rug was pulled out from under everyone.
 "There were so many emotions when the season got cancelled. At first we thought we would be coming back after spring break but it never happened," Quinn said. "It happened over a week or so, but it still felt like it was just a second from when I was enjoying my senior season to everything being all over.
 "We'd check in with each other to make sure everyone was doing OK after it all ended, but it's still kind of sad that we never really got the chance to say goodbye to each other.
 "Playing sports meant so much to me. I miss it already."
 While her athletic career may be over, there is more education in Quinn's future. She plans to continue studying to become a physician's assistant or attend medical school.

Lionel Messi has outlined his journey from sickbed to three-time Club World Cup winner.
 The Barcelona superstar missed his team's semi-final triumph over Guangzhou Evergrande after being struck down with renal colic – a type of abdominal pain commonly caused by the kidney stones.
 But Messi returned to Luis Enrique's starting line-up for Sunday's final against River Plate in Yokohama, opening the scoring before a Luis Suarez brace ensured Barca ran out 3-0 winners.
 The Spanish and European champions are the first three-time winners of the global crown, adding this year's success to titles collected in 2009 and 2011.
 Messi is now the only player to score in three Club World Cup finals, and was relieved to be passed fit for Sunday's match.
 "There was no more pain and that was really important," he told reporters.
 "It was really horrible pain. I was practically the whole day in bed without being able to move.
 "In the second half I felt my legs a little bit but the important thing was not to have any pain."
 The victory over River Plate means Barcelona swept the board in 2015, having also claimed La Liga, Copa del Rey, Champions League and European Super Cup glory.
 Atletico Madrid's defeat to Malaga on Sunday means the Catalan giants head into Christmas leading the way in Spain's top flight once more and Messi is hungry for yet more success.
 "I'm happy, happy for everything - happy to keep making history with this great club," he added.
 "Let's hope we can just keep winning more, of course.
 "It's special because it's the World Club Cup and we come out as the best team in the world once again. To win that for another year is really impressive.
 "The more trophies we can win, the better. We know it's more difficult every year.
 "We'll try to fight for everything like we do every season, we're really excited about it."

“By mid-March, I had 15 trips in my book for April and what typically happens is once you start catching fish, once the fish are biting then we start getting more phone calls.

 “In the summer time — June, July, August — I'm out on the water every day. Last July, I made 41 trips,” he said. “March and the beginning of April is normally the start of our busy seasons, so this has effected us and all the charter captains immensely. Not only are we closed, but there's no one calling in to book dates in the coming weeks. Normally, my month of May would be completely full by now.”
 Capt. Yablonsky said most who have booked excursions that have been postponed are holding their deposits and will try to rebook at a later date. Most charter boats can accommodate between four and six anglers at a time at a cost of anywhere between a couple hundred dollars per trip to just over $500, depending on the local company.

Lionel Messi has revealed Ronaldinho told him to take his No.10 shirt months before the Brazilian left Barcelona in 2008.
 Ronaldinho joined Barcelona in 2003 and inherited the iconic number from Argentine midfielder Juan Roman Riquelme - who was sent on loan to Villarreal for two seasons.
 The Brazilian star left after six years with the club, scoring almost 100 goals in just over 200 appearances.
 And Messi revealed in an interview with Barca TV that Ronaldinho already promised him the No.10 shirt months before he announced he was leaving.
 "Before leaving the club [Ronaldinho] was coming off a few months where he was thinking about things," Messi said.
 "He had it in his mind that he was leaving and he told me to have his number.
 "I took it without looking at what he had done with the shirt. If I did, I would not have taken it."
 Messi has won 21 trophies with the No.10 on the back of his Barca jersey, and a total of 26 with the Spanish giants.
 The Argentina international praised his former team-mate Ronaldinho and spoke about his early stages in the Barca dressing room.
 "Everyone welcomed me into the dressing room, and [Ronaldinho] welcomed me in a spectacular way," he said.
 "To go into that dressing room was not easy but he made it all so much easier. I was very comfortable by not only Ronnie's welcoming but everyone.
 "Those who came up from the [Barca] B sat on the other side [to the main group]. The locker room did a 'U' and we sat in-front, and there came a moment that [Ronaldinho] told me to go to his side and that I no longer needed to be where I was anymore.
 "There was a spot free and there was Deco and [Thiago] Motta right there, and he sat me right beside them. I must admit at the start it was hard.
 "But he said no, that I was good where I was until I basically obliged to sit there."
 Ronaldinho was just as complimentary of his former team-mate.
 "He's a simple person, very chilled, and he sat by my side in the dressing room," he said. "We had the chance to start a good and honest friendship. He's a great man."

Lionel Messi believes Barcelona team-mate Neymar has developed into a "more complete" player since their meeting in the Club World Cup final in 2011.
 The Brazilian was regarded as an unproven teenager when his Santos team took on Pep Guardiola's Barca four years ago, losing 4-0.
 However, Neymar has since established himself as one of the world's top players following his move to Camp Nou, recognised by his inclusion - alongside Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo - on the shortlist for the 2015 FIFA Ballon d'Or.
 And four-time Ballon d'Or winner Messi has been impressed by his team-mate's progress.
 "A lot of time's gone by since then and I've witnessed his enormous growth, both as a footballer and as a person," Messi told FIFA.com.
 "Back then he was already a really great player and now he's even more so - he's much more complete.
 "Truthfully, it's a pleasure and a privilege to have him alongside us now."
 Messi acknowledged the Catalan side now have a more direct approach under Luis Enrique, but insists their possession-based philosophy remains integral.
 "We've changed a little bit. We've become a more vertical team. Of course, we've not lost our ideology of keeping hold of the ball, that's our trademark and our priority: to control the play and keep possession as much as we possibly can," he added.
 "But now we've incorporated the idea that, with just a couple of touches, we can get in front of the opposition's goal.
 "Before it was about getting there using more elaborate build-up play."
