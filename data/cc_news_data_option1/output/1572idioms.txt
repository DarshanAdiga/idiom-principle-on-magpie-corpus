Attorneys for the AFL-CIO argued that allowing “free-riders” in a union shop — employees who are not members of the union and do not pay union dues — represented an illegal taking of union resources, since unions would effectively have to represent them in collective bargaining at union expense.
 In the majority opinion, Jenkins argued, “The Act also does not take property. The obligation on certain labor organizations to provide collective bargaining and grievance services to non-member workers is imposed by federal law, not the Act.”
 He added, “The Act does not infringe on any liberty interest by prohibiting compelled dues. The obligation to provide services to non-members is imposed on labor organizations by federal law, not the Act, and they are compensated for those services.”
 In a statement Tuesday, Attorney General Patrick Morrisey commended the court for adhering to the rule of law.
 “We applaud the state Supreme Court of Appeals for upholding the rule of law with an opinion that finally brings clarity on this important question. This is a major victory for worker choice,” he said.
 The state AFL-CIO called the decision “an unsurprising but still highly disappointing move.”
 “Circuit Judge Bailey had rightfully ruled that the so-called ‘Right to Work’ act clearly violates the West Virginia Constitutional rights of unions and individuals with regard to the illegal taking of their property,” West Virginia AFL-CIO President Josh Sword said in an emailed statement. “This law has been the centerpiece of a years-long, partisan-driven agenda by the anti- worker majority to lower wages and benefits and eliminate workplace safety regulations — all in order to place corporate profits far above the health and safety of West Virginia workers, which is shameful particularly in light of the current pandemic we’re facing.”
 Sword said the labor unions in West Virginia will continue to operate as they have since the Supreme Court lifted the injunction on the law in 2017.
 “As always, we will continue to negotiate for fair wages, good benefits and a safe workplace,” Sword said.

Still, our National Parks are a fundamental feature of American culture and they will be back in business soon enough. Not only are they beautiful and an oasis from the trappings of the modern world, but they showcase how government can be used for the best of ideals, protecting our innocent wildlife and majestic landscapes for all to experience and treasure. When they are reopened for our enjoyment, it will be a great opportunity for us as a nation to reflect on how we treat our natural resources and what we can all do together to strengthen them now and for generations to come.
 April 18-26 is National Park week, which normally would be the perfect time to enjoy the natural splendor of America's 400+ parks in person. However, with most parks closed, the National Park Foundation has created some resources for people sheltering in place to enjoy the parks virtually, along with a helpful guide on how we can all better support our system of National Parks going forward.

“The biggest reason for me signing to New Orleans was the opportunity for further development,” Brautman said. “I felt very comfortable with the coaching staff and felt like it is a great place for me to continue and pursue my goals and dreams as a person and as a player.”
 NCCC is a fine starting place to pursue baseball goals – Panthers head coach Steve Murry has coached up 58 minor league players and two MLB studs – but the baseball season came to an end because of COVID-19. With only 17 games played, this can impact players, and the All-KJCCC Honorable Mention reflected on the matter.
 “Was it bittersweet?” Brautman asked. “No, I wouldn’t necessarily say bittersweet. I am very saddened it ended the way it did because we were just starting to heat up. We had a great opportunity to become the team that everyone feared in the Jayhawk (Kansas Jayhawk Community College Conference).”
 Brautman, who will pursue a marketing major, gave credit to the NCCC coaching staff.
 “Oh man, I can’t even put into words how thankful I am. I am truly, truly blessed to be put into this situation, but I could not have done it without the help of Coach Murry, Coach (Josh) Merrill, and Coach (Mike) Gilner. They’re a huge reason for my development and they shaped me to be the baseball player I am today. They taught me to play with confidence even when things were bad. It’s safe to say they will always be a part of my life. God truly put me in the best spot and I wouldn’t change a thing.”
 Starting pitcher Ben DesRosiers chose New Mexico State as his next destination for baseball and to study biology. DesRosiers tossed a two- and four-seam fastball in the mid-80s, the curveball, the slider and a changeup. These pitches led to a pitching record of 2-1, with 24 strikeouts in 15 and 2/3 innings.
 DesRosiers said he chose a program that will best help him to develop.
 “The biggest reason for signing was I got an opportunity to achieve one of my biggest goals of playing Division-I baseball at a school that I think can really help me develop more and achieve my next goal of playing professionally,” he said.
 While it has been a dream to play professional baseball for some time for DesRosiers, it was a bit premature to think about that level, especially with the season ending abruptly.
 “Having to go home early was horrible,” DesRosiers said. “As far as talent goes, this was an incredible group who had potential to go very far. But more than that, they were a fantastic team who fed off of each other and pushed each other and played very well as a group. I was so excited to see what we were going to accomplish, and it all got cut short.”
 Even so, the experiences solidified that playing baseball at NCCC was a great decision for him, though the pitcher from Chicago didn’t necessarily want to go the junior college route initially. Murry, Gilner and Merrill all played a hand in developing DesRosiers as a player and as a person, and he said he can’t thank those men enough, despite the current set of circumstances.
 “Overall, leaving halfway through my sophomore year was devastating and very emotional saying goodbye,” DesRosiers added. “And the coaches were what made NCCC great. They have been around the game for so long, so the experience they have to share is very helpful in learning the mental aspects of baseball, but also how much they help with the recruiting process will guarantee to give every player and opportunity to play at the next level after JuCo ball.”
 Starting pitcher Kyler Hancock’s opportunity materialized into signing with Southeastern Oklahoma, where he will study business management. Hancock, who pitches a four-seam fastball, a two-seam fastball, a changeup and a curveball, finished the abbreviated season with a 1-1 record, eight strikeouts and no home runs given up in eight innings.
 The Dewey, Okla., native found a way to continue his maturation process while staying close to home.
 “The biggest reason to me would have to be the fact that I wanted to continue playing and find somewhere close to home if I could, and man did it work out perfectly,” Hancock said. “I really liked the coaches as well at Southeastern.”
 Hancock is all-in on the Southeastern Oklahoma move, but that doesn’t mean he doesn’t lament what could have been.

PLYMOUTH - One trait of all great coaches is unpredictability, but there is one old faithful that Plymouth North Dwayne Follette always leans on. No questions asked.
 "When we have a big game, I'll always hand the baseball to Jeff Rodden," the veteran manager said about his senior right-handed starting pitcher. "Jeff's an incredible competitor, and he's one of those players that's not afraid of the spotlight. He pitches his best in the big games, so that's why I'll always try to slip him in there for a start when we have teams like Plymouth South or Silver Lake on the schedule.
 "He may not have as many wins as some other pitchers, but that's because of the quality of the pitching that he's constantly going against. He always gets matched up against the other team's stud pitcher and he never backs down from the challenge."
 Rodden's quiet demeanor belies the competitive fire inside his 6 foot, 160 pound body, Follette said. He describes his two-year captain as "the ultimate competitor."
 "Jeff's got tremendous intestinal fortitude, and it really comes out on the mound, especially when we have a big game. He gets a look in his eye that says you're not going to beat him that day," Follette said. "Jeff's got a great approach to the game and he brings it every time he takes the ball."
 Rodden made a big splash as a sophomore, pitching with the confidence of a savvy veteran on the road to earning his first of two Patriot League All-Star nominations. He's been the backbone of a pitching staff that's carried the Eagles to a pair of playoff appearances in those all-star years.
 His performance in last year's 1-0 opening round Division 1 South playoff loss to Catholic Memorial perfectly showed Rodden's competitive fire. Facing off against C.M.'s highly-touted Division 1 prospect Michael Gemma, Rodden matched him pitch-for-pitch, retiring 16 batters in a row at one point. His effort caught the eye of at least one college coach in the stands that day.
 "(Wentworth Head Coach Steve Studley) came up to me after the game and asked me if I'd be interested in pitching for his baseball program," Rodden said. The answer was a resounding yes, and Rodden will join the pitching staff of the Division 3 program, joining Plymouth South graduate Ryan Obin. He'll study Biomedical Engineering at the Boston college.
 A true student-athlete, Rodden already knows the rigors of competing on the athletic field while keeping his grades up to snuff. The co-president of the National Honor Society is one of the top students in Plymouth North's Class of 2020.
 A pitcher's best friend is his out pitch, and for Rodden that pitch would be a curve ball. He throws a solid fastball that can touch 80 mph with tremendous accuracy, but the curve ball is his bread and butter pitch he throws in "any count, any situation" according to Follette.
 "I've thrown the curve ball since I was about 12 and I've had some success with it," Rodden said. "I can throw it with confidence and I think that mentality helps me when I go to the curve ball. When I throw it there is some conviction behind the pitch."
 As he waits more than a little impatiently to get the season rolling, Rodden already has his mind set on getting the Blue Eagles into the playoffs once again this spring.
 "I want to get to the playoffs and win a game or two this time," he said.
 Rodden is accustomed to success on the baseball diamond. He was one of the stars on the pitching staff of the Plymouth 12-year-old Cal Ripken all-star team that went to Arkansas and won the national title back in 2015.
 "That was a fun summer," said Rodden, who came from the South Plymouth Little League to get to know future Plymouth North teammates like Josh Gomes, Nick Durocher and Nick Viscariello. "We just had fun playing a lot of baseball together and we kept finding ways to win close games."

 As business skyrockets for Amazon and other online shipping and delivery services during the pandemic, it's tempting to ask whether it's time to pull the plug on the U.S. Postal Service, with its every-door every-day delivery schedule, its bricks-and-mortar neighborhood service centers, its unwieldy pension burden and the enmity of President Donald Trump and much of the GOP establishment. It's widely projected to become insolvent this year, with drop- dead estimates ranging from June to September, and in any case before October -- when vote-by-mail ballots are due to go out in much (and perhaps all) of the nation.
 Trump's dislike of the Postal Service is so intense that he reportedly threatened to veto the recent $2-trillion economic relief package if it included any postal bailout. Private airlines and other giant corporations, yes; the national lifeline that reaches virtually every American in good times and bad, no way.
 Yes, the agency is premodern -- in a good way. When the electricity goes out, the cell tower is down or the internet isn't working (all of which could easily happen during a natural disaster or enemy attack), the Postal Service and its employees are the nation's vital link, as befits a publicly held resource. One emergency plan not (yet) in use is to have postal workers quickly deliver to each American an antidote like Cipro in the event of a wide-scale biological attack. Who else would be able to do that? As a recent Wired article notes, the plan could quickly and easily be retooled for a pandemic.
 The agency plays an essential role in urban and suburban areas, where postal workers are the ones who bring many of those Amazon packages to the front door. And in rural and hard-to-reach areas, postal workers are the only ones who provide regular delivery service because there's not enough money in it for private courier businesses. Postal delivery is the only way many Americans can get their essential medications or pension checks -- and yes, ballots, much to the chagrin of Trump, who accurately recognizes that broadening the voter base diminishes the election chances of Republicans like himself.
 The agency is a little like face masks, ventilators and test kits -- national goods too easy to forget about when there is no emergency, and to economize into oblivion just before you need them.
 Congress has hamstrung the agency with an unsound plan to fund future retiree pensions. It also has prevented it from employing modern technologies or adding services that might compete with private companies. It should unleash the agency.
 In the short term, though, Congress should do exactly what should be done for the nation's most essential services in times of emergency. It should properly fund the Postal Service to keep it serving us in normal times and to keep it ready for times like now.

“There was no sweet at all; actually, it was just bitter,” he said. “The season ending that way sucked, but I definitely wouldn’t want to do it with anyone else. I can’t thank coach Murry, Coach Gilner, Coach Jacks and Coach Merrill enough for helping me and guiding me to where I’m at today. That being as a person and a student-athlete. Having that coaching staff is an absolute blessing.”
 Starting pitcher Cameron Blazek signed with New Mexico State in the fall, and he will study business. Blazek, a four-seam fastball, curveball, slider and changeup All-KJCCC Honorable Mention pitcher, closed the year with a 1-1 record, 25 strikeouts, and a 4.32 earned run average. The Fargo, ND, native said he handpicked a school that would be best for his skill set.
 “I felt like NMSU is the perfect fit for me because they are a very competitive program in a very good conference. They are in a great location in Las Cruces, New Mexico. I am basically guaranteed great weather and I felt like I could go in and earn a spot to contribute right away for them.”
 Blazek wanted to contribute even more at NCCC though.
 “It was difficult to not get to finish out the year playing for NCCC,” Blazek said. “We were incredibly excited and confident in our team and wanted to compete and show what we could do.”
 Still, Blazek said the knowledge imparted to him from the coaching staff was second to none.
 “I owe them beyond words,” Blazek said. “The amount of maturity I gained both mentally and physically while being in Chanute is unable to describe. They have truly helped me make the steps towards being the player and person I want to be. With that being said, my work is for sure not done, but with the knowledge I gained from my two years under the coaching staff, I know what I need to continue to work on. I am so very thankful and I will miss the program and the people close to it a great deal.”
 Starting pitcher Josh Flack signed with Kansas State University in the fall to not only play baseball, but also to study finance. Flack, who throws a four- seam fastball, a changeup and a slider, culminated the season with a 1-1 record, including 17 strikeouts, a 3.43 ERA and an opponents’ batting average of .269, picked KSU because he had always wanted to play at the highest college level.
 “I chose Kansas State because it had always been a goal to play for a D-I program and they now have some of the top facilities in all of college baseball,” Flack noted. “And I really liked what I heard from the coaching staff, so I decided to make it my new home.”
 Flack also thanked NCCC.
 “I can’t thank the staff at Neosho enough for taking me in and believing in me during times of struggle,” Flack said. “They helped me grow as a man and mentally get ready to compete at baseball’s highest levels in the future.”
 On April 15, outfielder Chaseton Wylie signed with Southeastern Oklahoma to play the game with Hancock, and to keep his head in business management books for a degree. Wylie on the year hit .205 with a .341 slugging percentage, eight RBI, nine hits and a .920 fielding percentage.
 Wylie, an Osawatomie native, said he was sold on the first visit to Southeastern Oklahoma.
 “The biggest reason for me to sign at SOSU was the environment when I went on my visit and the coaching staff,” Wylie said. “They have a fire to win and I wanted to be a part of that.”
 A will to win is something Wylie picked up from the coaching staff at NCCC. And Wylie said he understands that, even in a seemingly alternate universe everyone is currently living in.
 “Not being able to play out the rest of the season due to the virus was heartbreaking,” Wylie said. “With the group of guys we had and the talent we had, it was hard to walk away from the season like that. Coach Murry, Coach Gilner and Merrill have made me such a better baseball player over the past few years. Made me believe in things that every kid wants to believe in.”
 Murry said he is exhilarated about all his student-athletes pursuing their dreams during a time of trial and tribulation for the entire country.
 “I am super excited they were able to accomplish their goal of moving on to their four-year (schools),” Murry said. “In the same breath, I am sad we did not get to finish watching their development over the last few months.”

It’s not all doom and gloom due to the COVID-19 pandemic wiping out the junior college baseball season. After Neosho County Community College went 11-6 in the shortened season, several players made the decision to move on to Division-I baseball for the spring of 2021.
 Six Panthers have signed to move on to the next level as of Wednesday, April 15, the NCAA-postponed first day of signing. But there will be more decisions in the very near future.
 Infielder Andrew Brautman will go to the University of New Orleans, signing on April 15 at his home in Ark City. Brautman, whose 2020 shortened season comprised a .469 average (highest on team), three home runs, 15 RBI, a .703 slugging percentage, a .550 on-base percentage and a .945 fielding percentage, chose UNO because he felt it was the best place for him to get better.

Roberts defended the decision saying that it had simply been a matter of judging how much work was able to be done while placing the business on hold and paying employees accordingly. "It's what activities are being paused and what's the skeleton staff we require for the activities that continue and that leads you to a temporary solution, which is the national coaches being part- time through this period," Roberts said. The state associations and the cricketers association (ACA) had reservations about CA's measures around coronavirus, but Roberts said he had support from majority of stakeholders.

Dr Allsopp said face masks, when worn properly by trained health professionals, do protect them from Covid-19.
 If members of the public were to wear facemasks, she argued, it would be to protect others from you if you have the virus.
 Wearing masks if you do not have the virus could actually increase the risk of catching it because people would be touching their faces more often.
 Dr Allsopp is “really worried” that patients who may come in to a GP surgery with a minor reason – in order to divulge something more serious but discreetly, may not be doing so and could fall through the cracks.
 She said this could include a patient coming in with the excuse of a spot on their finger but then explaining that they are a victim of domestic or sexual abuse, that they have an eating disorder or mental health problems.
 Dr Allsopp said sometimes a parent may come in with their child due to their youngster having a cough, it may only be then that a health professional will notice a suspect bruise on the parent’s face and the patient reveals they are being abused.
 This is why Dr Allsopp said general practice must remain face-to-face but agrees it “will change at the end of all of this and I think it will probably change for the better and we will use technology in a much better way than we have ever used it in the past”.

“Wayne County is ranked fifth among West Virginia counties for total number of cases and number one for deaths. … This pattern is occurring in other parts of the country as well that had first onset in nursing homes,” McCann said. “Testing in all nursing homes will likely cause the number of new cases in West Virginia to rise … and may drop Wayne County down in ranking as we uncover new cases in other counties,” he said.
 The deaths in Wayne County are also mostly associated with the elderly demographic in the county, pointing to the nursing facility.
 Last week, the state evolved its guidance for testing at long-term care facilities after the staggering case load at the facility as well as other similar ones within West Virginia.
 All long-term care facilities, regardless if they have positive cases or not, will have all residents and staff members tested for COVID-19, West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice ordered, including retesting facilities that have already been tested. Justice said he was “sick and tired” of discrepancies in data collection and testing in the state’s nursing homes, pointing out one of his first responses to the pandemic was to restrict visitation at these centers that house one of the most vulnerable populations.
 “Frankly, some of these people are dying, so good enough isn’t good enough,” Justice said.
 The order signals that the state has significantly increased its capability to test for the novel coronavirus. According to the West Virginia Health Care Association, the largest trade association representing nursing facilities and assisted-living communities in the state, there are more than 18,000 employees caring for about 10,000 people.
 Justice also announced on Tuesday plans to cancel in-person schooling for the remainder of the academic year.
 “I have promised you I would not put you in a position that would be harmful and that I would protect you, including our kids,” he said.

The factory closed on March 17, the date that France's lockdown entered into force, compelling people to stay at home except for essential outings.
 Under the measures, industrial producers are allowed to continue operating as long as protective measures have been put in place.
 Social distancing between people is a key part of the strategy to limit virus spread, along with hygiene measures such as regular hand sanitizing and covering the mouth or nose when coughing or sneezing.
 The Onnaing factory is the only Toyota plant in France, and employs about 4,500 people.
 Only staff with no health problems or personal obstacles to working were allowed back Tuesday, and operations restarted in phases with smaller teams at first.
 From 500 staff on site Tuesday, the plant expects to have about 1,400 by Thursday for production to resume, with daily production of 50 cars per day at the start, compared to a thousand daily before the outbreak started.
 In the workshops, marks on the ground indicate the direction of foot traffic and encourage everyone to keep to their right in an attempt to minimize the risk of workers getting too close to one another.
 Collective water fountains have been replaced with individual bottles, vending machines put out of service and catering services canceled.
 Special trash bins are provided for used masks, and plastic screens were erected in some areas of the work floor to separate workers.
 On the assembly line, some were busy making plastic visors with newly acquired 3D printers.
 Thomas Mercier, a representative of the French Democratic Confederation of Labor union, judged the measures "sufficient," while adding "there is still worry among some of the workers."
 But the more radical General Confederation of Labor union denounced what it described as an "irresponsible" move.
 Plant workers "are immersed in the population and this is dangerous for us, our families and the entire region," said union leader Eric Pecqueur.
 "The shareholders of Toyota are putting profits above our health," he said.
 The company said protective barrier measures will remain in place for several months at least.
 European automobile sales fell by 55 percent last month due to coronavirus lockdown measures, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers Association.
 On Sunday, French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe warned the country was "not out of the health crisis yet," and insisted the lockdown must be strictly respected until May 11, when it will start being lifted in phases.

COLUMBUS, Ga. (WTVM) - Certain businesses will be allowed to reopen in the Peach State as early as Friday. The governor announced his plans Monday to slowly start reopening the economy.The first places able to reopen in Georgia are businesses the governor says have not been able to keep up with minimum operations many other businesses have been able to under shelter-in- place guidelines. Governor Brian Kemp says these businesses will have to follow restrictions including Minimum Basic Operations.“The entities which I am reopening are not opening as business as usual,” Kemp said Monday as he announced his plans to slowly start reopening the economy.Minimum Basic Operations include taking employees’ temperatures, thorough cleaning, and separating work spaces by at least six feet.Kemp said places of worship will be allowed to hold in-person services, but they must follow strict social distancing protocols.“We’re just airing on the side of caution," said Pastor Adrian Chester of Greater Beallwood Baptist Church in Columbus.Chester said they will continue worship virtually for at least another month or so.“From a pastoral perspective, I believe it’s a tad-bit premature to give people that leeway, especially since it is evident that there has not been adequate testing and that this virus is asymptomatic," Chester explained.Chester said they will re-evaluate once COVID-19 numbers start going down in Columbus, the state, and the nation.Georgia businesses allowed to reopen Friday include gyms.“I am no way shape or form currently ready to reopen. It’s just impossible and the government said that we can, but there’s no practical things been in place to ensure that we can do that," said Vincent Turner, owner of Hybrid Fitness in Columbus.Nail and hair salons as well as barbers are also allowed to reopen Friday.“Instantly I realized we would not be able to effectively perform services, not at the level we’re used to with practicing social distancing," said Kim Palmer with 5Fourteen Hair in Columbus.“With this industry, if we don’t do something now, we’re all going to go down a road that is potentially going to break us all. And we won’t have an industry so, I think it was a great thing that he did," said Youtopia Salon Owner Amanda Collins who plans to reopen her Columbus salon.Movie theaters and restaurants can reopen next Monday. With steps being made to reopen the Georgia’s economy, the governor urges Georgians to continue sheltering-in- place as much as possible.He also said to limit travel and who goes with you to run errands. Kemp is asking Georgians to wear face masks in public if possible.Kemp’s order allowing certain businesses to re-open takes precedent over any local rules that would keep them closed.Copyright 2020 WTVM.

Maybe it was always destined that Kevin Harvick would one day end up driving a Mustang. As a kid growing up in Bakersfield, CA, he would often go for rides with his aunt, who sported a 1960’s version that set the standard for what a muscle car is supposed to be. Now, as driver of the No. 4 Busch Light Ford Mustang for Stewart-Haas Racing, he gets to experience it like few others can. His first on-track victory with Mustang came in 2018 when he won the NASCAR XFINITY Series race at Atlanta Motor Speedway, but when Ford brought the world’s best-selling sports coupe to the Cup Series last year, he found it even more to his liking with four wins and a spot in the Championship 4 at Homestead-Miami Speedway. But that’s the only place you’ll see him driving a Mustang -- at least for now. With wife DeLana and children Keelan and Piper waiting for him at home, there are other more practical choices for the Harvick family. And, like most parents who go through the sometimes- maddening exercise of switching out car seats between multiple vehicles, the final destination is the determining factor. “I have an F-150 pickup and a Lincoln Navigator,” said Harvick when talking about what vehicles he drives most frequently around the house. “It depends on the task at hand to be honest with you. If we’re going to the go-kart track, it’ll be the pickup truck. If we’re doing anything else on a daily basis, I’m gonna drive the Navigator.” But whether it’s picking up Keelan at school or driving to the race shop, Harvick is no more immune to the construction delays and traffic tie-ups than the fans who cheer for him on Saturday nights or Sunday afternoons. As a result, he does the same thing many of them do by utilizing technology to his advantage. “I think the thing I use the most is the GPS because with Charlotte having all the traffic, no matter where you’re coming from or going to, it’s nice being able to use that and all the hands-free pieces built into the vehicle,” said Harvick. “For me, I’m a do not disturb guy on my phone as I drive, so having all that stuff on the screen is pretty handy to stay in tune with life as you’re driving along and not get stuck in traffic.” The fact Harvick would have an F-150 as one of his vehicles shouldn’t come as a surprise to those who remember him behind the wheel of the racing version in what was then the NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series in 1999. Driving for Liberty Motorsports, owned by Jim Herrick and Brad Daugherty, Harvick started all 25 races in the No. 98 F-150 that season and posted three runner-up finishes while ending up 12th in the final point standings. One of the trucks from that year has a special place in not only Harvick’s heart, but his personal collection of vintage race cars. “That’s one of the cool pieces of my collection and was the last time I drove a Ford before we switched at SHR in 2017,” said Harvick of the truck nicknamed ‘Bully’. “It was a truck that Butch Miller and Kenny Irwin drove before I got there. We used it as a short track truck, and Butch actually won a race with it at Colorado National Speedway, so it has a lot of history.” With his next Cup victory Harvick will become only the 14th driver to register 50 career wins in NASCAR’s top series and give him another Mustang moment as memorable as the one from his youth.

With eSports and virtual racing in the national spotlight, the eNASCAR Heat Pro League (eNHPL) will kick off its 2020 season from virtual Homestead-Miami Speedway on Wednesday night. Differing from various series on the iRacing platform, the Heat Pro League is contested on more traditional gaming systems – both the Sony PlayStation 4 and Microsoft Xbox One – with a 14-race season beginning Wednesday. It will include 14 events that feature three separate four-race segments and a wild-card round that will set the four-team field for the championship race in the season finale. The team that wins each segment will automatically qualify for the championship race with the wild card round determining the final entry. Teams will compete for a total prize pool of more than $200,000 throughout the season. Roush Fenway Gaming returns its driver in the No. 6 entry – Nicholas Walker (gamertag wowTHATSgarbage) – an Elwood, Indiana, native on the Xbox platform. He was a winner of two eNHPL events in 2019 (Fontana, Watkins Glen) and tallied six top-fives and seven top-10s. In 10 races, he started on average in 11th place and maintained a fifth-place average finish. Walker’s strong 2019 helped propel Roush Fenway to the 2019 series playoffs and a fifth-place team finish in the season points standings. New to the RFR stable in 2020 is Brandon Hanna (gamertag Cheezuh), the 10th overall pick in the 2020 eNHPL draft. A native of Goshen, Indiana, Hanna made his way into the Heat Pro League by finishing third in the nationwide qualifiers. He won the league’s first official qualifying race at Chicagoland, and went on to finish sixth and 12th in the final two qualifiers. Also new to this season, the eNHPL will utilize NASCAR Cup Series, NASCAR Xfinity Series and NASCAR Truck Series entries across its 14-race schedule. The 2019 schedule used only NCS machines. Roush Fenway is no stranger to success in the virtual racing realm, after claiming the 2019 Coca- Cola iRacing Series Championship with Zack Novak in the No. 6 machine. The iRacing league has run five of its 20 points races of the 2020 season, with the schedule alternating every other week. It currently broadcasts on eNASCAR’s Twitch channel. The eNHPL season opener can be viewed on both the eNASCAR Twitch channel and at eNASCAR.com beginning at 8 p.m. Wednesday. As always, Roush Fenway will have coverage of the events primarily on its Twitter feed, @roushfenway. RFR PR

TUCSON, Ariz. (KOLD News 13) - It might be the peak part of the produce season in Nogales, but a lot of warehouses are seeing a surplus of stock due to COVID-19. Inside TruFresh, they're seeing several things stick around.“The hardest to move have been cucumbers because that’s a big food service item you use it for salads and whatnot and melons. Honeydews melons, cantaloupes,” said TruFresh Sales Manager Kiki Peraza.TruFresh missed out on big businesses during the days leading up to Easter when they rely on big brunches and family gatherings to get their stock sold.“I would say retail is down 55 to 56 percent, food service I’ve heard is down as much as 95 percent," Peraza said.They’re hoping that there’s not a lot in the pipeline right now and looking for certain windows to get things sold while other parts of the country are lagging.“Offshore cantaloupes from other countries like Guatemala and Honduras are seeing volume slow down,” Peraza said. “That should help our season here. Domestic cantaloupes out of Coachella (California) are running a little bit behind, watermelons in Texas are starting to wind down as well. So we’re waiting and banking on those little windows to keep us moving.”Another plus is that they’re farmer-owned, meaning they can keep some supply in Sonora if needed. But even that option can still backfire."The big concern is at any moment the national market in Mexico can come to a complete stop and that’s when it can hit us a little stronger,” she said.For now, they’re looking toward the future, hoping that, as the country slowly opens up, people get back outside and get businesses flowing."People want to go out to parks and they want to go out to the beach and they’re going to take their fruit cups and they want to eat their watermelon. So we’re kind of banking on all of that.”So that the physical fruit of their labor doesn’t sit and spoil.“If the lockdown continues and gets extended through May, as they say, we’ll cross that bridge when we get to it. There really isn’t a plan it’s something that we’ve never seen and obviously we’re all in the same boat," Peraza said.Copyright 2020 KOLD News 13. All rights reserved.

Qatar-based broadcaster beIN Sports said the kingdom should be held to account for a Saudi-backed pirate network stealing live broadcasts of games. Yousef Al-Obaidly, the beIN Media Group CEO, warned of the "danger of allowing the acquisition … given the country’s past and continuing illegal actions and their direct impact upon the commercial interests of the Premier League.”
 The intervention of a broadcast partner who has helped the league become the world’s richest soccer competition comes amid growing financial pressures on clubs caused by the coronavirus pandemic that has seen no games played in six weeks. Masters has said the crisis could cost the league more than £1 billion ($1.2 billion) with broadcasting contracts in danger of not being fulfilled.
 While the league grapples with an unprecedented shutdown it is having to examine whether to grant Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund clearance to buy Newcastle from retail entrepreneur Mike Ashley. The PIF is due to be the 80% majority partner in a £300 million ($370 million) takeover alongside the wealthy British-based Reuben brothers and financier Amanda Staveley.
 PIF is overseen by the Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who Amnesty says has been involved in a "sweeping crackdown on human rights.” The Premier League does not have specific human rights standards set out in regulations that are used to assess the suitability of new owners.
 "So long as these questions remain unaddressed, the Premier League is putting itself at risk of becoming a patsy of those who want to use the glamour and prestige of Premier League football to cover up actions that are deeply immoral, in breach of international law and at odds with the values of the Premier League and the global footballing community,” Amnesty International UK director Kate Allen wrote Monday to Premier League chief executive Richard Masters.
 Amnesty raised concerns with Masters about the 2018 killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul as questions linger over the crown prince’s culpability.
 Agnes Callamard, a U.N. special rapporteur who authored an inquiry into the killing, called for sanctions on Prince Mohammed and said responsibility for Khashoggi’s killing falls on Saudi Arabia. The report found "sufficient credible evidence regarding the responsibility of the Crown Prince demanding further investigation.”
 The Premier League can block new owners if "in the reasonable opinion of the board" it can be determined they "engaged in conduct outside the United Kingdom" that would have resulted in a conviction in the UK had it taken place within the country.
 Saudi Arabia’s trial of 11 suspects in the Khashoggi killing was held in secret and does not include the crown prince’s top adviser at the time — Saud al-Qahtani — who has been sanctioned by the U.S. for his suspected role in orchestrating the operation.
 PIF's vision, overseen by Prince Mohammed, is to ultimately pay for the mega state projects that will modernize and overhaul the kingdom and create jobs for young Saudis.
 "The Crown Prince has been using sporting events and personalities as a means of improving the Kingdom's reputation following the grisly murder of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi — widely believed to have taken place with his approval," Allen wrote to the Premier League. "Such positive associations with sporting events also distract attention from Saudi's appalling human rights record, including the imprisonment and torture of women human rights defenders.”
 The letter cites Loujain al-Hathloul, one of Saudi Arabia’s most outspoken women’s rights activists, who was one of more than a dozen women detained in 2018, just weeks before the crown prince lifted the ban on women driving — something they been calling for in their push for equal rights.
 PIF's London-based media advisers have declined comment on the takeover. Ashley, who bought Newcastle in 2007 and owns the Sports Direct chain of retail stores, commented in 2018 on previous takeover talks with Staveley that collapsed but he has been silent on this latest attempt to complete a deal.
 Protecting TV revenue has previously seen the Premier League lodge its own complaint against Saudi Arabia along with other soccer bodies over the "persistent and illegal screening” by beoutQ of games where beIN holds the rights. It is a proxy dispute in a wider Gulf diplomatic standoff.
 Al-Obaidly, who runs beIN, told Masters that as a "huge investor in the Premier League, we urge you to consider carefully all the implications" of allowing the takeover of Newcastle, asking him to "enforce your own rules against Saudi Arabian based persons or entities.”
 The teams were told by Al-Obaidly in a separate letter that the "the potential acquirer of Newcastle United caused huge damage to your club’s and the Premier League’s commercial revenues" at a time when sports are feeling the "crippling economic effect that coronavirus.” Al-Obaidly is also on the board of Qatar- owned Paris Saint-Germain.

"We work really far out relative to the industry,” Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos said during an earnings call with analysts Tuesday. "We don’t anticipate moving things around.”
 Over the past decade, Netflix has lured more than 180 million customers to its streaming service by offering a never-ending buffet of new shows. Seemingly nothing — not debt, not competition, not bad reviews — could stop its weekly drop of new dramas, comedies and documentaries.
 But the coronavirus has plunged Netflix into unknown territory. The company has paused production all around the world, with the exception of Iceland and South Korea. The global health crisis has interrupted the production of a new season of the hit show "Stranger Things,” as well as a movie starring Dwayne "The Rock” Johnson.
 With a lineup that includes "Too Hot to Handle,” "Black AF” and "Space Force,” Netflix isn’t going to run out of shows this quarter. It also has the rights to the Michael Jordan documentary "The Last Dance,” which has already been a hit for ESPN. But Netflix has no way of knowing what will happen later this year, which is one of the reasons it cautioned investors Tuesday not to read too much into a record-breaking surge in subscribers last quarter.
 "No one knows how long it will be until we can safely restart physical production in various countries, and, once we can, what international travel will be possible, and how negotiations for various resources (e.g., talent, stages and post-production) will play out,” the company said in a letter to shareholders.
 Netflix has shifted all of its animation series to remote production, and did the same with post-production on more than 200 shows. Animation is a huge new area of investment for Netflix, and now includes a couple of buildings in Hollywood. The company earned an Oscar nomination in 2020 for the animated movie "Klaus,” and has more than a dozen animated series due for release this year. It’s unclear how the new setup will affect the rollout of any projects.
 Netflix still plans to release more original content in 2020 than last year. And for the moment, the pause in production is a boon to its finances, helping lift cash flow.
 If Netflix can’t make as many movies itself, it can always buy them. Its film division will benefit from other studios being eager to offload product due to the temporary shutdown of movie theaters. Paramount Pictures and Media Rights capital sold Netflix "The Lovebirds,” a comedy starring Issa Rae and Kumail Nanjiani, while Legendary sold Netflix a film starring Millie Bobby Brown of "Stranger Things” fame.
 Rather than waiting to see when they can release those movies in theaters, the studios can book a profit by selling the projects above cost to Netflix. Netflix, meanwhile, gets new films to market to its users.
 But if Netflix can’t get production up and running this year, neither animation nor new movies will fill the hole. The company releases hundreds of new TV shows, documentaries and other specials each year, and most of them require having dozens or hundreds of people on a set somewhere.
 A long hold on production could prevent Netflix from releasing as many shows as its customers have come to expect, and provide a reason for many cost- conscious consumers to cancel their subscriptions. The company put out 180 new titles in the U.S. last quarter, according to the blog What’s on Netflix, and had plans for similar amounts in the quarters ahead.
 Netflix said that a lack of new material might affect it less than peers because of its large library of old shows. But the company has also said time and time again that new shows are the biggest drivers of new customers. That’s why Netflix has minimized the impact of rival studios pulling popular programs like "The Office” and "Friends.”

Visions -- one of the organizations consulting with Arlington on its diversity, equity and inclusion efforts -- recently hired Elika Dadsetan-Foley as its executive director.
 Visions consultants Rick Pinderhughes, Michelle Holmes and Doug Weinstock have been working with Arlington over the past several months, along with others, to improve the town's diversity, equity and inclusion efforts.
 After 36 years in the captain's chair, Valerie Batts stepped down as Visions' executive director, announcing Dadsetan-Foley her successor. Batts will remain part of the organization and will focus her time in keeping her hands and mind in the work, while Dadsetan-Foley will focus on the actual running of Visions as an organization.​
 "I'm thrilled to join Visions, both in the U.S. and across the world, through our widespread consultant team, including our work in Arlington," Dadsetan- Foley said.
 Dadsetan-Foley has worked on five continents doing social justice, development and humanitarian work, including with the World Bank.
 She's been an activist from an early age, concerned and fighting for the environment, homelessness and refugees since childhood, and she's excited to bring that energy to Boston.
 "I feel very humbled to join the Visions community," she said, adding that she is very excited to come on board and support Visions in continuing to do the work they do, across the country and the world.
 She chose to settle into work in the U.S. after nearly a decade abroad, after she rescued her German shepherd mix, Server, from Lebanon -- a choice that brought her back to be closer to her family, and which eventually led her to meeting her now-partner, Sean Dadsetan-Foley, in Baltimore.
 She has made the "first real home" of her adult life in Duxbury -- after time in France, Lebanon, Tajikistan, Sierra Leone and Iraq -- and looks forward to continuing the work Visions started over 35 years ago.
 "I am delighted to welcome Elika to Visions. [The] Visions board decided in early 2019 that our work was clearly needed in the world more than ever and that it was time to find a new leader who could guide us into the future. Our vision is to be a catalyst for a more equitable world where differences are valued and utilized for the benefit of all. Elika's passion and life's work are so synchronous with this view; the breadth and depth of her experience in living into this vision will enhance all of our ability to help achieve this goal," said Batts.

As business skyrockets for Amazon and other online shipping and delivery services during the pandemic, it's tempting to ask whether it's time to pull the plug on the U.S. Postal Service, with its every-door every-day delivery schedule, its bricks-and-mortar neighborhood service centers, its unwieldy pension burden and the enmity of President Donald Trump and much of the GOP establishment. It's widely projected to become insolvent this year, with drop- dead estimates ranging from June to September, and in any case before October -- when vote-by-mail ballots are due to go out in much (and perhaps all) of the nation.
   
 Trump's dislike of the Postal Service is so intense that he reportedly threatened to veto the recent $2-trillion economic relief package if it included any postal bailout. Private airlines and other giant corporations, yes; the national lifeline that reaches virtually every American in good times and bad, no way.
   
 Yes, the agency is premodern -- in a good way. When the electricity goes out, the cell tower is down or the internet isn't working (all of which could easily happen during a natural disaster or enemy attack), the Postal Service and its employees are the nation's vital link, as befits a publicly held resource. One emergency plan not (yet) in use is to have postal workers quickly deliver to each American an antidote like Cipro in the event of a wide-scale biological attack. Who else would be able to do that? As a recent Wired article notes, the plan could quickly and easily be retooled for a pandemic.
   
 The agency plays an essential role in urban and suburban areas, where postal workers are the ones who bring many of those Amazon packages to the front door. And in rural and hard-to-reach areas, postal workers are the only ones who provide regular delivery service because there's not enough money in it for private courier businesses. Postal delivery is the only way many Americans can get their essential medications or pension checks -- and yes, ballots, much to the chagrin of Trump, who accurately recognizes that broadening the voter base diminishes the election chances of Republicans like himself.
   
 The agency is a little like face masks, ventilators and test kits -- national goods too easy to forget about when there is no emergency, and to economize into oblivion just before you need them.
   
 Congress has hamstrung the agency with an unsound plan to fund future retiree pensions. It also has prevented it from employing modern technologies or adding services that might compete with private companies. It should unleash the agency.
   
 In the short term, though, Congress should do exactly what should be done for the nation's most essential services in times of emergency. It should properly fund the Postal Service to keep it serving us in normal times and to keep it ready for times like now.

CHESAPEAKE, Va. (WAVY/CNN) - An HVAC technician in Virginia donated his entire $1,200 stimulus check to a father in need because he felt it would have been selfish to hold onto the money while others struggle.Cameron Crockett works as a heating, ventilation and air conditioning technician in Chesapeake, Virginia. His work is considered essential, so as millions of Americans lose their jobs because of state shutdowns, he still goes into work every day.Cameron Crockett, an HVAC technician in Virginia, donated his $1,200 stimulus check to a father who lost his job as a bartender because of the COVID-19 pandemic."So, I felt like it would have been selfish of me to hold onto that money for whatever purpose, when I have friends out there who are truly struggling," Crockett said.He posted to Facebook, asking people to write to him if they were unemployed due to the coronavirus. Fifty people did so.The randomly selected winner was Aries Ziegler, who lost his job as a bartender and is struggling to take care of his young daughter."He was basically at a point where he was at a breaking point. He didn't have any savings left. He's faced with bills. He's got a young daughter to take care of, Crockett said.Years ago, Crockett was at the center of an involuntary manslaughter case. He was convicted and served eight years behind bars but still maintains his innocence. He says the experience forever changed his perspective on life.“No matter what your circumstances may be, it taught me there’s always somebody out there whose circumstances are worse than yours,” he said. “While I could have held onto the money to try and buy a house or put it toward any number of things, I think it would be selfish of me to do that when I have friends out there who are faced with the very real threat of not being able to maintain a roof over their heads at all.”Crockett is encouraging others, if they can, to also donate their stimulus checks to those in need.

“The consumption has increased by over 30 per cent and Digicel has increase the bandwidth for such traffic, which has not comprised the quality as price packages remain the same.”
 According to Kayumov, the demand for Digicel Play, during this period has increased, with other customers from other providers wanting to come across. However, he said due to the movement restrictions, it is impossible to connect everyone at this time.
 Head of public relations at the telecommunications company, Colin Greaves, who also sat in on interview, said that there has been a 57 per cent increase in Netflix traffic, a 55 per cent increase in Facebook traffic and 16 per cent increase in Google traffic.
 Greaves also elaborated on the assistance that Digicel is giving to the Education Ministry, as he said last week, 98,000 Home and Entertainment customers, now have free access to video and demand tutorials from the ministry for the Secondary Entrance Assessment (SEA), Caribbean Advanced Proficiency Examinations (CAPE) and Caribbean Secondary Education Certificate (CSEC) students.
 On April, 17 the University of the West Indies, Campus in St. Augustine, announced that Digicel along with Bmobile have agreed to a 3-month waiver of data access charges (zero-rating) for those accessing UWI-affiliated websites on the respective networks.
 In relation to children who cannot afford internet and live in rural communities, the Digicel CEO said the company is working with the Ministry of Education along with other E platforms to come up with a solution on the way forward.
 “The role of government in this situation should not be neglected, as without support and partnership from the administration, private companies such as Digicel will be limited in what can be done to help the vulnerable children”
 Kayumov also said students with data can benefit from free 1 gigabyte (GB) free LTE Data, and free minutes from 11pm to 5am.
 He said that the telecommunications company has done its part to ensure that their customers can function during this pandemic.
 With regards to late payments and disconnections during COVID-19, Kayumov said over 22,000 customers have had their late fees on Home and Entertainment accounts waived and have received rebates valued at $440,000.
 In terms of mobile disconnections he said “The post-paid customers who did not pay their bills in 57 days were disconnected as the company has financial commitments to meet as well. But it was agreed that seven days extra would have been given to them to pay, without a late-fee charge.”
 Asked whether staff will be downsized or salaries will be cut as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the CEO said his main focus is getting through this rough patch with staff and customers.
 “Because the virus is evolving every day, the company does not know what kind of decisions that have to be taken to mitigate the fall, but my main focus at this point, as CEO is to steer Digicel in the right direction to weather the storm.”
 He explained that since the restrictions were put in place, 80 per cent of his staff have been operating from home and executing their duties via virtual meetings.
 Out of 35 stores nationwide, 26 remain open during this period, including the head office which is at 11c Maraval Road, Port of Spain.
 Turning to Digicel Group a company founded by Irish billionaire and investor Denis O’Brien, on how they are looking to renegotiate bonds on the international market and whether it would have an impact on their Trinidad operations.
 Antonia Graham- Digicel’s group head of communications said the objectives of the Exchange offer are to reduce their overall Group debt to more sustainable levels, extend the debt maturity profile and address upcoming near term maturities and improve liquidity.
 “Last Wednesday was the first closing date for the transaction with acceptance levels among bondholder groups very high ranging between 86 per cent and 97 per cent which is far in excess of the levels of 50 per cent and 75 per cent required,” Grahams said.

The staff kept on the job are working on 20 percent of their usual salaries but CA's executives remain on 80 percent of their usual base rates of pay. Roberts defended the decision saying that it had simply been a matter of judging how much work was able to be done while placing the business on hold and paying employees accordingly. "It's what activities are being paused and what's the skeleton staff we require for the activities that continue and that leads you to a temporary solution, which is the national coaches being part- time through this period," Roberts said. The state associations and the cricketers Association (ACA) had reservations about CA's measures around coronavirus, but Roberts said he had support from the majority of stakeholders.

Current crisis a 'wake-up call', Maritime Union says
 Earlier on Wednesday, before the announcement, the Maritime Union of Australia (MUA) renewed calls for the Government to develop its own storage capability, instead of rely on the United States' own reserve.
 In a statement, the MUA said the coronavirus pandemic was a "wake-up call" and demonstrated how quickly global supply chains could break down and how volatile global markets could become.
 The MUA's assistant national secretary, Ian Bray, said the crisis presented an "unprecedented" opportunity for the Government.
 "More than 90 per cent of our liquid fuel comes from overseas … yet without fuel, our economy would grind to a halt," he said.
 "The Morrison Government should take advantage of the unprecedented collapse in oil prices to build our own domestic fuel stockpile.
 "The Government should also commence the process of developing a strategic fleet that includes Australian-owned oil tankers, ensuring supplies can keep flowing during times of crisis."
 Some Australian farmers have been taking the same course of action, taking advantage of dropping diesel prices and stockpiling supplies.

_Editors note: Just reading this takes me back to that morning after. Our Gulf of Mexico waters in Southwest Florida still looked clear. It seemed so unreal. It was a surreal time period anyway — 2010 census, heatwaves, and then we came to find we could not swim in the Gulf. Thered tide was on the increase as well — phosphate mining, other things like a continual flow of pesticides into the Gulf from agriculture, the constant condo spraying all along the borders of the seas, sewage, bacteria. There was great sorrow. Worse than the jet skis that smelled of oil and cut the backs of gentle manatees. —Cynthia_

"He is still a relatively young man and has served a number of jail sentences, but with some motivation he could make a significant improvement in his life.
 "It's a cycle he is in and a cycle he needs to get out of and with the bladed article, it was a cry for help for him to be arrested and removed from whatever situation he was finding himself in."
 His Honour Judge John Thackray gave Dockerty his wish and sentenced him to 17 months behind bars.
