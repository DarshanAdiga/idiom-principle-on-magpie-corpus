MOSCOW -- Russia overtook China in the number of confirmed coronavirus cases on Monday, when its tally climbed above 87,000, as pressure rose on the government to consider easing lockdown restrictions for businesses to help shore up the rattled economy.
 Russia, the world's largest country by territory, has been on lockdown since President Vladimir Putin announced the closure of most public spaces in late March. These measures are due to expire on April 30 and Putin has not yet said if he plans to extend them.
 Anna Popova, the head of Russia's safety watchdog Rospotrebnadzor, told state television on Monday that, in her view, restrictions should be in place until May 12.
 Earlier Prime Minister Mikhail Mishushin asked his government to submit proposals by Thursday to ease some of the restrictions on businesses. Many firms have warned that they risk going bankrupt if the lockdown continues, and thousands of workers have been laid off.
 Mishustin told an online government meeting that as soon as the situation started to improve "we would need to consider a step-by-step cancellation of restrictions on certain companies…operations."
 On Monday, the authorities reported 6,198 new cases of the new coronavirus, bringing the total to 87,147, with 794 deaths.
 Moscow plans to open two new hospitals, with 1,500 beds each, in the defense ministry's Patriot museum and in the Crocus exhibition center, once a spot for lavish concerts, business daily RBC reported on Monday.
 St Petersburg, the country's second largest city, is also turning Lenexpo, which used to host Russia's top economic forum, into a temporary hospital with 1,000 beds.
 ENERGY SECTOR IN FOCUS
 Russia, one of the world's top oil and gas exporters, is particularly vulnerable to the spread of the coronavirus at production sites. Most are located in remote areas accessible only by air, meaning the workers must be in close proximity, increasing their risk of infection.
 Citing local officials, news agency Interfax said on Monday that an airport in Sabetta, in the northern Yamal peninsula, had been shut down for quarantine after cases of the new coronavirus were detected at the Yamal LNG production site controlled by Novatek.
 A total of 143 cases were confirmed in Sabetta, the local crisis response center said separately.
 In the northwestern region of Murmansk where Novatek is building a plant to supply its next LNG project, the Arctic LNG 2, more than 800 workers tested positive for coronavirus, the local crisis response center said on Sunday.
 Velesstroy, a sub-contractor for the plant, temporarily suspended work at the site near Murmansk, but said in a statement to Reuters that the project would remain on schedule.
 To limit the risk of contagion at more than 1,000 power plants in Russia, including nuclear ones, more than 200,000 employees - or nearly a third - were recently tested for the virus, the energy ministry said.
 It did not say how many of those tests returned positive.
 Mainland China, where the new coronavirus first emerged, reported a total of 82,830 cases on Monday. China is now fighting an increased number of new cases coming from Russia.

While it wasn’t initially clear that venture-backed startups were eligible for the federal loans, lobbyists spent weeks pushing to clarify that they could participate. The idea gained support in Congress, including from two powerful Californians, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Rep. Kevin McCarthy, who leads House Republicans.
 The National Venture Capital Association also guided investors on participation. Firms like Menlo Ventures distributed messages from the group, asking founders to persuade Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., who leads the small business subcommittee, to support rule changes.
 Field, the association lobbyist, said it was up to individual companies to decide whether they could truthfully tell the government that they required help.
 “You have to certify need, there’s no doubt about that,” he said. “How do you define need is a subjective question that you have to figure out.”
 In recent weeks, prominent investors including Albert Wenger at Union Square Ventures, Mark Suster of Upfront Ventures, Seth Levine of Foundry Group and Olsen of Drive Capital, have published blog posts or letters urging most startups not to pursue the money.
 “We just think those companies ought to not get in line in front of Main Street businesses,” Wenger said.
 Manny Medina, founder of Outreach, a sales software startup that has raised $238 million and is valued at $1.1 billion, said his board of directors and bank had initially pushed him to apply for a loan. His contacts at Silicon Valley Bank told him that the program would be a “free-for-all” and a “run to the money,” he said. Outreach did not apply, he said, but “there was some real pressure.”
 Julia Thompson, a spokeswoman for Silicon Valley Bank, said that what Medina had described did not represent the lender’s “official stance, but may have been one person’s characterization.”
 Some startups that applied for the loans argued that their jobs should not be treated as more disposable than, say, waiters or house cleaners, despite much higher salaries. Several said they had a fiduciary duty to keep their company alive.
 Kendrick Nguyen, chief executive of Republic, a site for investing in startups that has raised more than $16 million in funding, said he had applied so his company could be in a strong position when the economy bounced back. Republic has enough money to keep going for one to two years despite a steep drop in business last month, he said.
 Nguyen said that Republic had not asked its investors for more money “because, quite frankly, we are in a very sound financial situation for a tech startup.” He declined to be specific about the financials.

“In many countries, detention facilities are overcrowded, in some cases dangerously so,” Michelle Bachelet, the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, said in a statement. “The consequences of neglecting them are potentially catastrophic.”
 At least 125 countries hold more prisoners than their correctional systems were designed for, including 20 that have more than two times the number of inmates they’re equipped to secure, according to the World Prison Brief, a database kept by the Institute for Crime & Justice Policy Research at the University of London.
 The virus’s ease of spreading behind bars became clear in February, when at least 555 inmates in China were infected at facilities in Hubei, Shandong and Zhejiang provinces.
 In response, the government dismissed several wardens for their failure to prevent the outbreak, forbade prison visits and required guards at several facilities to remain at their posts for weeks.
 Five prisons in Hunan designated a building within each facility to isolate infected prisoners and guards. Inmates in a Shandong prison were taken to hotels for quarantine after a prison guard returning from Wuhan, where the coronavirus was first reported, infected other guards and inmates.

That number includes those who tested positive and continue to test positive, those who initially tested negative but have since tested positive, and those who are awaiting final testing before they can be classified as recovered.
 Fourteen sailors have recovered, with the requirement for recovery being two successive negative tests.

 The outbreak aboard the USS Theodore Roosevelt was first announced on March 24, when there were only three cases on board.

The political could hardly be more personal.
 But the prime minister's return to work and return to health is far from a metaphor for the country making a quick recovery from the crisis.
 In contrast, Boris Johnson's statement at the lectern this morning was a request to the public to be patient, to keep going, to hold firm through the frustrations of living life mainly behind closed doors for a while longer.
 Despite some restlessness among the public, increasing volume in his own party, and from the opposition for a clearer route out of this, for the prime minister it's not yet the time to give more detail, and certainly not yet the time to change any of the restrictions.
 And when that time is reached, when the infection rate is deemed low enough, he was clear, that there will be no sudden nirvana - life in the 'next phase' will be a slow return of a more familiar rhythm, acknowledging, but not being swayed by demands to open up the economy much more swiftly.

On Friday, the World Health Organization warned against relying on these tests for policy decisions. While countries such as Italy have even floated the idea of “immunity passports” for people who test positive, WHO officials noted that it is not known to what extent people carrying antibodies are immune to the virus.
 (The WHO on Saturday backed off an earlier assertion that people with antibodies may not be immune at all.)
 But widespread testing has started nonetheless, and important decisions are likely to flow from the results. The National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and virtually every university with an epidemiology department has begun antibody surveys in communities across the United States.
 “It seems like all of a sudden, everybody just decided that antibody tests are going to give them some grand answer,” said Dr. Michael Osterholm, an infectious diseases expert at the University of Minnesota.
 The goal of most of these projects is to get a handle on the size and nature of the epidemic here rather than to guide decisions about reopening the economy. But now scientists are racing to fine-tune the tests and learn more about what having antibodies actually means, both for the patient and for the community.
 Many questions raised by these initiatives have no easy answers: When will we achieve “herd immunity”? How quickly does the virus spread? How long does immunity last, and how strong is it?

Through the petition, Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind argued that it is painful to submit that the role of police in democratic society, particularly in Delhi, is biased, having communal colour and discriminatory. The role of police officer “as a Law Enforcement Officer is to serve mankind; to safeguard lives and property; to protect the innocent andweak against violence and disorder; to keep the peace; and to ensure the constitutional rights of all to liberty, equality and justice irrespective of caste and creed.”But unfortunately the police have shown inhuman behavior against the minority community, mostly the victims of riots. Especially in the Delhi case, the method of arrest does not suit the laid down guidelines. Therefore, the High court’ recommendations to abide by the guide lines is welcome step says; Senior advocate Anup George Chowdhry. He explained the guidelines that the Hon’ble Supreme Court in D.K. Basu vs. State of West Bengal 1997 (1) SCC 416 had laid down guidelines in case of arrest and detention of the accused person which are as follows:(1). The police personnel carrying out the arrest and handling the interrogation of the arrestee should bear accurate, visible and clear identification and name tags with their designations. The particulars of all such police personnel who handle interrogation of the arrestee must be recorded in a register.(2). That the police officer carrying out the arrest of the arrestee shall prepare a memo of arrest at the time of arrest a such memo shall be attested by at least one witness. Who may be either a member of the family of the arrestee or a respectable person of the locality from where the arrest is made. It shall also be counter signed by the arrestee and shall contain the time and date of arrest.

The Fed has also said it will buy up to $750 billion in corporate bonds, including riskier debt bearing higher yields — a “bit of a precarious step,” Bostjancic said, because the Fed normally avoids taking on credit risk.


  Two weeks ago, as part of a $2.3 trillion lending program, the Fed said it would, for the first time, buy municipal bonds issued by state and local governments, up to $500 billion. It also unveiled a Main Street Lending Program, which will also for the first time lend $600 billion to medium-sized companies of up 10,000 employees.


  The loans are intended to support mostly companies that are too large for the government's small business lending program, which targets those with fewer than 500 workers. Companies that borrow from the Main Street program must “make reasonable efforts” to retain their workers, the Fed says, and cannot repurchase their shares or pay dividends. The Fed has said it will disclose the recipients of its Main Street loans.


  Still, most of these programs haven't formally launched. The Fed has yet to buy any municipal securities or corporate debt. Even so, just the announcements that it will do so have smoothed markets.


  The announcements have also generated concerns about who will end up benefiting and who will not. As part of its new Municipal Liquidity Facility, the Fed said it would buy muni bonds from all 50 states and some large cities. But only those cities with populations above 1 million and counties with populations of more than 2 million are eligible. That grouping includes just 10 cities and 16 counties and doesn't take large metropolitan areas into account.


  Mark Vitner, senior economist at Wells Fargo, noted that the Fed's criteria exclude large metro areas with smaller core cities. In many cases those cities are majority-African American, generating concern among some analysts about the fairness of the program. Detroit and Atlanta, for example, failed to make the cutoff, while San Diego and San Jose did, even though their metro areas are smaller than Atlanta's.


  “The further the Fed pushes, the more issues it is likely to unearth,” Vitner said.


  Still, Vitner also notes that the Fed's announcement of the Municipal Liquidity Facility helped reduce rates for muni bonds broadly, thereby supporting all issuers.


  “What the Fed is doing is more holistic, and they are trying to support the whole economy," he said. “And they’re doing that by attacking specific pressure points.”

“In many countries, detention facilities are overcrowded, in some cases dangerously so,” Michelle Bachelet, the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, said in a statement. “The consequences of neglecting them are potentially catastrophic.”


  At least 125 countries hold more prisoners than their correctional systems were designed for, including 20 that have more than two times the number of inmates they’re equipped to secure, according to the World Prison Brief, a database kept by the Institute for Crime & Justice Policy Research at the University of London.


  The virus’s ease of spreading behind bars became clear in February, when at least 555 inmates in China were infected at facilities in Hubei, Shandong and Zhejiang provinces.


  In response, the government dismissed several wardens for their failure to prevent the outbreak, forbade prison visits and required guards at several facilities to remain at their posts for weeks.


  Five prisons in Hunan designated a building within each facility to isolate infected prisoners and guards. Inmates in a Shandong prison were taken to hotels for quarantine after a prison guard returning from Wuhan, where the coronavirus was first reported, infected other guards and inmates.

Signs such a move was imminent can be traced back to earlier this month and the statement of Liverpool chief executive Peter Moore on reversing the proposed use of the government job intervention scheme.
 Explaining how the club were preparing for a range of outcomes in light of the pandemic, he said: "These scenarios range from best case to worst and everything in between.
 "It is an unavoidable truth that several of these scenarios involve a massive downturn in revenue. We are engaged in the process of exploring all avenues within our scope to limit the inevitable damage."
 A disappointment for Liverpool supporters? Of course.
 Tickets for home games have become increasingly difficult to obtain, with tens of thousands on the season ticket waiting list and many, many more members ensuring the scramble for seats has meant regular sell-outs at Anfield.
 The prospect of extra seats in the new development - 5,200 are for general admission, with around 1,800 lounge and sports-bar style hospitality - would have sated some of the extra demand.

The state of New York on Monday canceled its presidential primary, which had already been delayed from late April to June 23, over concerns voting was an unnecessary risk amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
 With former Vice President Joe Biden the Democratic Party's presumptive nominee, Douglas Kellner, one of two of the party's commissioners on the New York State Board of Elections, said it would be "unnecessary and frivolous" to hold an effectively uncompetitive election in a state that is the epicenter of the U.S. coronavirus outbreak.
 Republican President Donald Trump will be seeking a second term in the Nov. 3 election. Biden's last remaining rival, Senator Bernie Sanders, suspended his campaign on April 8. Sanders had hoped to have his name on the ballot in remaining primary contests to enable his progressive supporters to choose like-minded delegates to influence the party's platform.

Although Guernsey County Children's Services has the capability to work remotely with a web-based system, staff still come in and out of the office as needed to meet with families.  
 "We have not stopped fulfilling our mandates. So we are still receiving calls and reports... and we are still initiating those cases and we are still investigating," said Executive Director Nicole Caldwell. "We are still making face to face contact and we are still seeing all of our children in foster care as long as they don't have a physical need that prohibits us from doing that. There are some folks that may be a little more susceptible to COVID and we don't want to make them sick."  
 The agency is trying to work technological ways to make face-to-face contact with many of their clients through Skype or FaceTime, but so far they have not had to use those.  
 According to Caldwell, the agency is still working all of its cases, and making contact with families.  
 The agency staff having to continue to go in and out of people's homes right now puts them at risk. The agency has a large need for personal protective equipment.  
 "We do not have access to N95 masks," Caldwell said. "We have tried to order some but we are not on the priority list for those."  
 The staff is currently using some of the surgical masks the agency had on hand. They have placed an order for more, but are not sure when they will arrive.  
 "We have a need for masks and we have a need for hand sanitizer," Caldwell said. "We have an order in for hand sanitizer that placed a long time ago that has not come in yet."  
 The agency is also in need of sanitizing wipes so workers can wipe down their steering wheels, gear shifts, keys, badges and that kind of stuff between home visits.  
 Caldwell anticipates that in the coming weeks, the agency will see an increase in the amount of requests that receive from families to assist them with bills and those types of things.  
 "To my knowledge, we have not seen an increase in those types of things so far but I anticipate that we will so any donations as far as monetary donations, non-perishable foods and those types of things will be needed at some point," Caldwell said.  
 Anyone wishing to make a monetary donation can send checks made out  Guernsey County Children's Services Attention Chrissy Smith, 274 Highland Ave., Cambridge, OH 43725.  
 The agency has a 24 hour hotline, so anyone wanting to make a donation in person can get hold of the agency at 740-439-5555. There is a receptionist in the building on most days who can arrange to meet someone who wishes to drop at the agency.

Australia is faring far better during the pandemic than many nations - with fewer than 6,800 confirmed cases and 83 deaths reported as of late April.
 Chief Australia Economist at BIS Oxford Economics, Sarah Hunter said the Australian government now had the "headspace" to focus on its long-term economic response.
 "Serious discussion around energy policy" should be part of measures to support recovery and growth, she said, especially while there was a a fairly "co-operative environment" between the government, opposition and industry.
 "Obviously nobody wanted what's happening right now. But if it does mean that we get an acceleration of some of these reforms, that can be very positive in the long run."
 ## 'Robust balance' of economy and climate
 So far Australia's economic response has centred around a A$130bn ($82bn: £66bn) support package - with a subsidy for employers to keep people in work.

Back in the early 1980s, hotshot business types on the go would have used what were referred to at the time as _portable_ computers from companies like Osborne or Kaypro. Due to the technical limitations of the era these so-called "luggables" were only slightly smaller and lighter than contemporary desktop computers, but they had integrated displays and keyboards so they were a bit easier to move around. A few years later the first generation of laptops would hit the market, and the portables predictably fell out of favor. Today they're relatively rare collectors items; a largely forgotten first step in the steady march towards true mobile computing.

In this regard, developing countries need to work hard on the land and promote sustainable paths to self-reliance in order to manage hunger and food insecurity. According to the paper titled, For Lack of Will, Child Hunger in Africa, over 50% of children in Africa continue to die of hunger-related ailments while about 257 million Africans are facing starvation. In this view, COVID-19 has accelerated issues of starvation due to lockdown activities in already vulnerable African countries. In this regard, COVID-19 is not the cause of starvation in African countries but it has compounded an already bad situation in these countries. Even if most of the citizens of African countries were to be released into the streets today, they will still be vulnerable to hunger and starvation because they have mastered the unsustainable art of surviving from hand to mouth.

 Another member, Amanda Amezcua, is able to squeeze five to six Zoom workouts in a week between work. “We see the other members on Zoom and that keeps us close as a community,” Amezcua said. “With the times they offer the camps I can do them before and after work. It’s great.”
 Andy acted quickly on applying for the Small Business Loan and Payment Protection Programs offered through the $2.2 trillion government stimulus package. About $6 billion in coronavirus loans were made to Colorado small businesses. The Dills are still waiting for approval of their loan applications.
 “We have 12 employees and we decided to intentionally to keep them at their normal pay through all of this,” Andy said. “All of these activities that we do gives our employees meaningful work that adds value to their lives, as well as our clients. The government programs have allowed us to keep a cohesive unit. If we didn’t have those government programs, we’d be paying out of our pocket or people would be losing their jobs.”

On Dec. 31, the World Health Organization was notified by Chinese health authorities of patients showing up with pneumonia of unknown causes. Less than four months later, more than 2.5 million people in 185 countries have tested positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus that first emerged in Wuhan, China. More than 185,000 people have died worldwide -- 1 in 4 of them American.  
 President Donald Trump has blamed the WHO for "severely mismanaging and covering up" the threat emerging from China. Other countries have joined in the criticism. Japan's deputy prime minister suggested the WHO be renamed the China Health Organization for having been too deferential to Beijing. And Australia's prime minister has pushed for an outside review of the WHO's action in dealing with the COVID-19 outbreak and urged major reforms on the international body.  
 There is little doubt that the WHO was slow in responding to the danger represented by the emergence of a potentially new virus in China and that it was too willing to accept Beijing's statements of what was happening.  
 It should have known better. The same day Chinese authorities told the WHO about the new pneumonia cases, Taiwan, which Beijing had barred from membership in the organization, sent the WHO a note asking for more information about a SARS-like outbreak, implying that the cases might involve transmission between humans. The WHO did not reply. But that very day, Taiwan imposed border controls and quarantine measures to prevent the spread of the disease.  
 By mid-January, the likelihood of human-to-human transmission of the disease was becoming increasingly evident. In Geneva, a top WHO official noted that "limited" transmission between humans had taken place and warned hospitals to take measures to control the possible spread of the disease. Yet, that same day the WHO tweeted that "Chinese authorities have found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission."  
 But the Chinese weren't being truthful, and by parroting its line the WHO delayed needed warnings and actions. Even after China revealed that human transmission was occurring, the WHO played down the need for action. It delayed announcing a global health emergency for a week, until the end of January, and even then it worried about not offending China. "The greatest enemy we face is not the virus itself," WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told security officials in Munich in mid-February. "It's the stigma that turns us against each other."  
 But that underplayed the threat of the virus itself. Indeed, for weeks Tedros praised Chinese actions and downplayed the outbreak. On Feb. 3, he reported to the WHO's executive board that efforts to control the disease in the epicenter of Wuhan were working to slow the spread of the disease to other countries to a minimum. "If it's minimal and slow, what is going outside can also be controlled easily."  
 But China's efforts to lock down Wuhan had come too late. Millions had already left the city, many unwittingly taking the virus with them to wherever global air travel would take them. As we now know, even in late January it was already infecting people in other parts of Asia, in Europe and in the United States.  
 Tedros and the WHO were aware of that possibility, which is why, even as they expressed hope the virus could be contained, they pressed nations to prepare in case it wasn't. Throughout January, the WHO published materials on how to prepare for and respond to possible cases, including blueprints for diagnostic tests. On Feb. 3, it released a "Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan" to help countries deal with the outbreak.  
 Throughout February, the WHO was regularly warning that the window of opportunity to prevent the spread of the disease was "rapidly closing." Most countries failed to listen. That included the United States. Rather than relying on the WHO testing blueprint, the administration insisted on making its own, ultimately flawed, test. And rather than using the month of February, after it closed down most travel from China, to prepare for dealing with the outbreak, it insisted the travel ban itself would do the trick.  
 That failure was on the administration, not the World Health Organization.  
 The WHO has its shortcomings, not least that as an international organization its authority and funding comes from the nations that comprise it. Big nations, like China and the United States, hold disproportionate sway over its actions, as Beijing demonstrated.  
 Even so, the WHO plays a crucial role, especially as the pandemic spreads to countries with weak health systems, which is most countries around the world.  
 A global pandemic requires a global response. And the WHO is critical to its success.

The unannounced first-party Xbox game in the works at The Initiative reportedly features "various weapons, gadgets, and a camera surveillance system."
 These features were described in the _LinkedIn_ profile of the studio's former technical designer, Christopher Ng (as spotted by _Klobrille_ on Twitter). Ng left The Initiative in February 2020 to work at VR studio Wevr, but he was in a senior role at The Initiative for around eight months, so his words definitely have weight. Now, plenty of games _could_ feature weapons, gadgets, and surveillance cameras, but with virtually nothing else to go on as of yet, any descriptor of The Initiative's new game is useful.
 Ng's profile also confirms that the game is being made in Unreal Engine 4 and contains "various world interactables and gameplay objects, such as doors, destructibles, hazards, triggers, and much more." Again, these can be found in any number of games, but Ng's description does at least trend toward an action-driven title. This is consistent with The Initiative's rockstar staff of third-person action-adventure veterans, ranging from Tomb Raider and God of War designers to Red Dead Redemption and Ratchet & Clank creators.
 Sadly, The Initiative's job listing _for a new lead technical designer_ doesn't tell us much more about what it's working on. Like the many other listings at the studio, it stresses its plans to "challenge how games are crafted" and "create groundbreaking experiences." The _listing for a senior tools engineer_ is a bit more informative in that it describes the studio's upcoming game as "hitting a AAA quality bar," but actual gameplay details are thin on the ground. Like, a single drop of water spread across an ice rink thin on the ground.
 __Xbox boss Phil Spencer previously teased__ _that The Initiative is doing "old things in new ways," so it could be working on some sort of series reboot or revival._

“Heads-up,” a radio barked. “Possible COVID.”
 The paramedics, Sean Mahoney and Kenny Cheng, rushed to the apartment building; donned gowns, goggles and face masks; and restarted the patient’s heart. But then the person crashed. The ambulance doors closed as Cheng frantically began chest compressions. Moments later, the patient was dead.
 Such is the disturbing new normal for the city’s paramedics, whose days can be mundane until — suddenly — they are not.
 The peak of the coronavirus epidemic in New York City — when paramedics were declaring scores of people dead a day — has passed, at least for now. Yet the virus still casts a shadow over everything they do. And when it resurfaces, it does so swiftly and with a vengeance.
 Like the rest of the city, paramedics are facing an unnerving uncertainty: When can they see their loved ones again? When, if ever, can they return to normal? And what if the virus comes back when they do?
 “It’s a little bit overwhelming,” said Mahoney, 40. “But that’s what we signed up to do, right?”
 Nearly two months into the coronavirus crisis, the strain has taken a heavy emotional and physical toll on paramedics. The city employs around 4,500 paramedics and emergency medical technicians, who are buttressed by privately employed ambulance crews paid by hospitals. Although the city’s medics work for the Fire Department, they are paid significantly less than firefighters and do not receive the same benefits.
 For weeks, they have worked exhausting days trying to save people, facing the threat of exposure each time they respond to a call. And after their shifts, they have had to isolate themselves at home to protect their relatives, spouses and children from infection.

  The project was given the green light at a virtual planning meeting on Thursday.

But I think it's also reasonable to assume that at some point when you add stores, you will end up with smaller stores that has, say, less potential. It's -- when you look at -- when you look at the store by installs, so to say, and those during 2016 for the various quarters, and 2017 for the various quarters, and also 2018, then we don't really see any slowdown of their velocity.

Sanders had hoped to have his name on the ballot in remaining primary contests to enable his progressive supporters to choose like-minded delegates to influence the party's platform.",

Dennis Rodman ha pasado a la historia como uno de los personajes más polémicos de la NBA. Una historia que ahora ha vuelto a primera línea de la actualidad tras las noticias de la posible muerte de Kim-jong Un, amigo personal de 'El Gusano', y por la emisión de 'The Last Dance', el documental que recorre la última temporada de Michael Jordan en los Bulls abrochada con el sexto anillo de la franquicia.


  Es la historia de una temporada convulsa en el seno de la franquicia y que vivió uno de sus capítulos más surrealistas con la escapada de Rodman a Las Vegas en mitad de la temporada.


  Un viaje permitido por su entrenador Phil Jackson y que terminó con Michael Jordan llamando a la puerta de la habitación del hotel donde se hospedaba Rodman porque éste no había vuelto a tiempo a Chicago. Mientras, en el interior de la estancia Rodman tenía que esconder a Carmen Electra para que Jordan no les pillara juntos.


  La modelo y actriz forma parte del extenso currículo amoroso de un Rodman que se ha jactado de haber estado "con más de 2.000 mujeres durante mi carrera deportiva de las cuales al menos 500 no eran prostitutas". Esta confesión de Rodman dista mucho de las 20.000 mujeres con las que confesó estar Witl Chamberlain.


  Entre las mujeres con las que el ex jugador de Pistons, Mavericks, Spurs, Lakers y Bulls ha estado destacan la ya citada Carmen Electra, Madonna, la actriz Vivica A. Fox o la actual propietaria de los Lakers Jeannie Buss.

At present, around 4,800 migrant workers from Odisha are working in 46 brick kilns in Jinnaram and Gummadidala _mandals_ of Sangareddy district, says a source at the local education office of the state government. And 316 children between the ages of 7 to 14, who attend the worksite schools run by the education department for migrant children, also live on the brick kiln premises. (The number of children younger than six years is not known.) The kiln that Hruday and Kirmani work at has 75 families – all from Balangir district – with 130 adults and 24 children in the 7-14 age group, as well as younger kids.
 “We start making bricks from 3 a.m. and finish the work by 10-11 a.m. We take a break after the morning shift. Women go to collect firewood, finish cooking, bathe the children and eat around 1 p.m., and then rest for a couple of hours,” said 31-year-old Joyanti, a mother of three, who works the same number of hours as her husband in the kiln. “Four persons work as a team. We again start work at 4 p.m. and continue making bricks until 10 in the night. By the time we eat dinner, it is close to midnight, or even 1 a.m.”
 Joyanti was married when she was 14 or 15 – she doesn’t remember the exact age. When we met her on April 5, she was holding on to her two-year-old son Bosanth, and trying to prevent her six-year-old daughter Anjoli from emptying a bottle of talcum powder, with which she was powdering her face to pose for photographs. Joyanti’s oldest son, 11, studies in the worksite school located at another kiln within walking distance, but the school is closed now because of the lockdown. Joyanti herself has never been to school; to tell us her age, she showed us her Aadhaar card.
 Joyanti’s husband’s family owns two acres of land in Khutulumunda. “Only one acre is cultivable,” she said. “We grow cotton, because everything from seeds to pesticides is brought to our doorstep by the seed company’s agents. They come back to buy the harvested cotton from us. We start sowing in June, when it rains, and harvest cotton at the end of November or early December. They give us Rs. 10,000 for the harvested cotton every year.”

Experts say the scope of the problem in Brazil behind bars is unclear because only 682 of the country’s more than 773,000 prisoners have been tested.
 Drauzio Varella, a doctor who has studied and written books about the health care needs of prisoners in Brazil, said a disproportionate number suffer from serious conditions, including diabetes, obesity and hypertension.
 “Prisons in Brazil often have double or triple the capacity they were built for, with people sleeping on the floor,” he said. “One person coughing can infect everyone else.”
 Even with the releases, tensions are escalating inside several Brazil facilities, where some gang leaders are threatening violent rebellions and others have smuggled out messages to relatives saying they’re going hungry.
 A group of gang members detained at a prison in Minas Gerais state recently recorded a video calling on all criminal gangs, which hold considerable sway inside Brazilian prisons, to join forces to wage “war against the government.”
 Reading from a statement, one of the prisoners said they were not being provided with medicine and complained about rancid food. He threatened to direct gang members outside to set buses on fire and execute prison guards as detainees standing behind him mimicked a decapitation.
 “This virus that is circulating around the world is going to kill many brothers in prison,” he said. “We’re prepared to knock down these prisons.”
 A state official said in a statement that the men in the video had been identified and that authorities had confiscated the cellphone used to make the video.
 To prevent transmission of the virus, officials in Brazil have suspended visits from relatives and lawyers and sought to step up hygiene measures at federal and state prisons.
 While Brazilian judges have approved thousands of early-release petitions, top Justice Ministry officials have said it would be a mistake to release prisoners en masse, arguing that would create risks to public safety.
 Prisoner advocates say it is more risky for the inmates to remain in prisons.
 Pastoral Carcerária Nacional, a Christian organization that supports prisoners and their families, said many relatives of the incarcerated have been barred from providing them with food and hygiene items.
 “Prisoners get the bulk of material support from what their families can bring, because the food they are given inside is terrible and scarce,” said Sister Petra Silvia Pfaller, the group’s coordinator. “Even before the pandemic they were already going hungry.”
 Andrelina Amelia Ferreira, who heads the Mothers of Jail Movement in São Paulo, said she had received hundreds of messages from women alarmed about the tidbits of information they have gleaned from prisons that are now inaccessible.
 One woman received a handwritten note from her husband, who reported running a high fever and having body aches. Lacking enough food, he told her, had prompted him to eat clumps of toilet paper and toothpaste.
 “I’m scared I will die in prison,” the note said. “I’m starving in this damn place.”
 Vincent Ballon, the top expert on detention issues at the International Committee of the Red Cross, said the coronavirus crisis should prompt governments across the world to reconsider the laws and policies that have led to overcrowded and poorly run prisons in the first place.

HAYS -- The giant Harley-Davidson sign visible from Interstate 70 will be coming down before June 30.


   


  That's the end of the road for Hays' long-standing Harley-Davidson motorcycle franchise, a staple of the community for 45 years, and familiar to everyone as simply "Doerflers."


   


  In a voluntary buyout by the company, Brian and Deanna Doerfler are getting out of the business, which was started in 1975 by Brian's dad, Alex, and uncle Don.


   


  "It's hard after 45 years," Brian said Friday at the store at 1100 E. 43rd St. "But it just feels like it's time."


   


  The Doerflers began working with Harley-Davidson 18 months ago on a succession plan for their successful business. But it became clear that only a well-capitalized new owner could manage the corporation's substantial franchise investment as it is now, Deanna said.


   


  "We could not actually sell it to anybody; they weren't going to accept anyone else besides us," she said. "They really didn't want us to go, but they would not come off their stiff requirements for the capital."


   


  The shop has been busier than ever as customers find out the franchise is going away, Deanna said on Friday.


   


  But the end of the franchise doesn't mean the end of the shop or the business.


   


  The Doerflers' legacy will live on, with ownership passing to longtime employee B.J. Rupp and his wife, Dena.


   


  Rupp started at Doerflers' 14 years ago.


   


  "That torch that Brian and Deanna are passing along to us is huge," Rupp said Friday. "Truthfully, Brian and Deanna are like my parents, I love them like my mother and father, they mean everything to me."


   


  Instead of just pre-owned Harleys, the Rupp's independent shop will sell other motorcycle brands, too.


   


  The business is relocating from Doerflers' existing newer 23,000-square foot metal building, and going back to its roots: 1007 Vine St., the 5,800-square- foot shop where the founding Doerflers started years ago.


   


  "Everything we're doing here, we'll be doing at 1007 Vine, the original shop," Rupp said. "Just without the Harley-Davidson franchise over the top of us."


   


  The hope is that Rupps can open their shop in early July.


   


  Brian and Deanna will also spend the next year or two helping B.J. and Dena get started, as well as selling off their shop's fixtures, and getting their big building leased or sold.


   


  After that, travel is in the picture. Their two daughters live on the East Coast.


   


  "We're ready to spend more time with them," Deanna said.


   


  The Doerflers plan to live part-time in Newfoundland, where Deanna's mother lives.


   


  "We're feeling better about our decision to pull out of the franchise. It's very hard though," Deanna said. "We're very passionate about motorcycling, but now we'll get to live it and do what we want to do. We're excited to ride more."

The ongoing impact of the coronavirus pandemic and the uncertainty it has brought, not least to the construction industry, has prompted FSG to act pretty quickly.
 It means the planning application will now be submitted in the spring of 2021 before work begins in December next year, should everything line up as Liverpool would hope. The news stand should be ready in the summer of 2023.
 In truth, it was the only decision FSG could make.
 But it has also given them breathing space to see whether or not the planned £60million construction remains feasible given football's financial landscape is likely to be somewhat different to when the plans were first officially unveiled in November.
 That's not cause for concern but merely sensible of any business.
 The project has already been through two public consultations which had resulted in a minor tweaking of the plans.
 The green light, though, will have to wait.

Oklahoma's governor has called on U.S. President Donald Trump to declare the coronavirus pandemic an "act of God," a step to help oil- producing states contend with a crude glut that caused futures prices to close below $0 last week for the first time."Over-production of oil continues to threaten the economy," Governor J. Kevin Stitt said in a letter to Trump that Stitt posted on Twitter late on Saturday. Declaring a "force majeure" or "act of God" would allow oil companies to halt operations without risking that land leases will be canceled for stopping production, Stitt said.Oklahoma's energy regulator said on Wednesday that current production can be considered "economic waste." That may allow producers to close money-losing wells without losing their leases, in what was viewed as a for struggling U.S. oil companies seeking relief from states after the market crash. U.S. production reached a record-high of near 13 million barrels per day late last year, but the pandemic has cut global consumption by 20% to 30%, or up to 30 million bpd.

World champion Josh Taylor fears it will be hard to motivate himself for the "glorified sparring" of boxing behind closed doors. The Scot was meant to defend his World Boxing Association and International Boxing Federation super-lightweight titles against Thai opponent Apinun Khongsong in Glasgow on May 2.But the outbreak of the coronavirus has put paid to that bout, with Britain in lockdown. And even when UK government restrictions are lifted, the British Boxing Board of Control has warned planned bouts may be subject to further delay if they risk placing additional strain on the National Health Service.It looks increasingly likely that any initial resumption of major sport in Britain, including boxing, will be without spectators. But Taylor said the absence of a crowd could deprive him of a competitive edge."It would be a bit like a glorified sparring match if there's only 50 people in the building," Taylor told BBC Radio's boxing podcast. "It's not ideal. I think for me it would be quite hard to get up for."If the crowd wasn't there you'd lose that wee bit of nervousness walking out. Just as you get ready to walk out, you see the crowd and think 'this is it man, what I live for' and there's no way I'm getting beat. It fires you up." Nevertheless, Taylor said he would consider taking a fight even if there were no spectators. "But, on the other side, I go back to my amateur days when there were only a couple of hundred there. So I'd go back to that experience to make sure I win the fight." Taylor has a perfect professional record of 16 victories, 12 inside the distance.But the 29-year-old needed a majority decision last time out to beat Regis Prograis in October's final of the World Boxing Super Series..

The beauty of the film is that it makes a devastating case against so-called "renewable energy" entirely with left-wing observers, and does not feature any of the long-time critics from our camp. Overall, however, the film is a red- hot mess, because its central point is the old fashioned, undisguised Malthusianism that there are too many humans on the planet, and that we have to give up growth and shrink our material existence. The greens these days are frantially trying to disguise their fundamentalism by calling it "degrowth," but it's the same old recycled doom and gloom and plea for green authoritarianism.

 There’s the scouting report.
 With a 2-0 lead to protect, Carpenter got two innings from Adam Wainwright and turned to Jordan Hicks as the closer with a one-run lead. Yadier Molina got the save. With a chance to tie the game in the bottom of the second, Molina tagged speedy Tony Kemp out at home plate after Luzardo had got Kemp into a pickle between third and home, as if testing Carpenter’s dexterity on the game’s controller. In the bottom of the third, the tying run got to third against Hicks before he struck out Matt Olsen. With Matt Chapman at the plate, the runner strayed from third on a ball in the dirt – and Molina threw him out to end the game.

"These jazz women were pioneers, and huge proponents in disseminating jazz and making it a global art form," Hannah Grantham (musicologist at the National Museum of African American History and Culture) tells The New York Times, whose list of 10 overlooked women through the genre's history includes pianist Lovie Austin, trumpeter Valaida Snow and violinist Ginger Smock. Though an inordinate amount of attention is placed on men in jazz, women played crucial roles on stage and behind the scenes since the genre's beginnings—whether as composers, performers, arrangers or artist managers. "Buffeted by sexism from venue owners and record companies in the United States, they often went abroad to pursue careers in Europe or even Asia," writes Giovanni Russonello. Valaida Snow—nicknamed the "Queen of the Trumpet" and "Little Louis"—toured for years from China to Egypt, Japan and beyond. Grantham adds, "I don’t think they’ve been given enough credit for that, because of their willingness to go everywhere." Read more at The New York Times.

Apple TV+ hasn't delivered a ton of original programming since it launched in November, but it has given streaming audiences some of the best and most creative scripted series of a new TV era, marked by its arrival and the touchdown of Disney+. A new content-packed challenger, HBO Max, debuts next month


   


  The irreverent and oddly charming "Dickinson" is one great example of Apple's winning gamble on unorthodox productions. The smart and moving anthology of immigrant tales, "Little America," is another.


   


  Now its newest offering, "Defending Jacob," could be Apple's first big flop. The limited drama series pales in comparison to Apple+ peers like "The Morning Show" largely because it avoids risk and embraces the formulaic. Part legal thriller, part whodunit, the eight-part series stars an A-list cast, adheres to familiar crime genre convention and steps so carefully toward the finale reveal that it often feels more sleepy than suspenseful.


   


  "Defending Jacob," which premiered Friday with three episodes, follows a driven, respected Massachusetts public servant whose world implodes when his 14-year-old son is accused of murdering a classmate. The big questions: Did the boy do it? And how far will his parents go to protect him? The idea is to keep viewers guessing up until the end, but the true challenge is sticking with this unimaginative story long enough to find the answers.


   


  Andrew Barber (Chris Evans) is an assistant district attorney who's poised for great success. His spouse, Laurie (Michelle Dockery), is a beloved leader at a school for disadvantaged youth. They appear to have it all -- looks, money, an Audi and a Range Rover -- until their son Jacob (Jaeden Martell) is arrested for allegedly murdering a classmate.


   


  Based on William Landay's novel of the same name, the TV adaptation brings viewers into the seamless lives of the Barbers, a family whose secrets could be their undoing. If only the journey toward that great fall or redemption (no spoilers here) had a few more unexpected detours or a jolt or two of adrenaline-producing turbulence.


   


  Instead, "Defending Jacob" is a measured and duplicative story that feels like a collection of clips from other well-produced, but ultimately forgettable, crime narratives. It's a wide field with plenty of players but only a handful of standouts, such as HBO's "The Night Of" or BBC's "Happy Valley."


   


  Cherry Jones is a welcome sight as the teen's sage defense attorney, and Pablo Schreiber, who plays Barber's former mentee and nemesis, is also a bright spot. As head prosecutor on the case, he'll do just about anything to destroy Andy's once-stellar standing in the courthouse and the community. They add a bit of grit and texture, which is sorely needed because there's little dynamism between Dockery and Evans.


   


  Martell is plenty creepy as Jacob. Or is he simply an emotionally clueless teenager? The character is intentionally hard to read, making his weird behavior annoyingly nebulous one moment, intriguing the next.


   


  Directed by Morten Tyldum, the series looks and feels like a prestige TV production. The woods are wonderfully foreboding (think "Dublin Murders"), perpetually rainy streets reflect the mystery and misery of the place, and inside the Barbers' upscale home, everything's a disquieting shade of oppressive off-white.


   


  The series does explore a few interesting theories about baked-in predispositions toward violence, and convincingly pits the deep love of father and son against the churn of a compromised criminal justice system.


   


  But Apple TV+ has done more, and better, with a lot less. "Defending Jacob" plays it too safe to break new ground, or repave old inroads into the genre.

Security researchers have discovered a critical security vulnerability in Microsoft Teams desktop and browser instances which could lead to widespread data theft campaigns, compromised credentials, ransomware attacks and corporate espionage.
 According to a blog post by CyberArk, researchers found that by that leveraging a subdomain takeover vulnerability in Microsoft Teams, attackers could have used a malicious GIF to scrape user's data and ultimately take over an organisation’s entire roster of Teams accounts. As users wouldn’t have to share the GIF – just see it --to be impacted, it has the ability to spread automatically.
 Researchers said that the vulnerability would have affected every user who uses the Teams desktop or web browser version.
 The flaw lies in the way Teams passes the authentication access token to image resources. Every time Teams is opened, the client creates a new temporary token or access token. This access token, in the form of JWT, is created by Microsoft’s authorisation and the authentication server – “login.microsoftonline.com.“
 The Teams client uses one of the created tokens to allow a user to see images shared with them or by them, as those images are stored on Microsoft’s servers which applies authorisation control. This token called “skype token,” can also be seen as a cookie named “skypetoken_asm.” Microsoft validates both the authtoken and a second Skype token via *.teams.microsoft.com.
 Researchers found two vulnerable Microsoft subdomains “aadsync- test.teams.microsoft.com” and “data-dev.teams.microsoft.com”.
 “If an attacker can somehow force a user to visit the sub-domains that have been taken over, the victim’s browser will send this cookie to the attacker’s server, and the attacker (after receiving the authtoken) can create a skype token. After doing all of this, the attacker can steal the victim’s Teams account data,” researchers said.
 Researchers created a proof of concept that only needs to the victim to view the Gif for the attack to work.
 “The fact that the victim needs only to see the crafted message to be impacted is a nightmare from a security perspective. Every account that could have been impacted by this vulnerability could also have been a spreading point to all other company accounts. The vulnerability can also be sent to groups (a.k.a Teams), which makes it even easier for an attacker to get control over users faster and with fewer steps,” said researchers.
 Researchers said that they worked with Microsoft Security Research Center under Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure after finding the account takeover vulnerability. Microsoft quickly deleted the misconfigured DNS records of the two subdomains, which were exposed to take over.
 Matt Aldridge, principal solutions architect at Webroot, told SC Media UK that the remote working policies should be reviewed, and cross checked for any security or privacy compliance risks as the user numbers scale up.
 “Monitoring and detection will need to be improved accordingly. There will be pressure on IT teams to get more users, better, faster and more secure access into their systems remotely, but this should not come at the expense of security and cyber resilience as a whole,” he said.
 Jake Moore, cyber-security specialist at ESET, told SC Media UK that it is interesting that the vulnerability lies in the more colloquial portion of the platform.
 “Fighting off strong competition, Teams has been able to hold its head high amongst the fierce battle of whose video conferencing app is the best. Teams has long prided itself on security but has possibly let a vulnerability slip through the net in the form of a GIF. Unless this is patched quickly, I would suggest businesses stick to the more formal procedure on Teams with no added GIF functionality for now,” he said.

Each country records and tracks both infections and fatalities differently, meaning the total number of cases and deaths are likely higher than official figures suggest.


  For example, in the UK, the number of people to die outside hospital environments - e.g. in care homes or at private residences - is not included in the official daily figure released by the Department of Health and Social Care.


  Meanwhile, some countries have begun preparations for easing lockdown measures implemented to combat the disease.


  In the US, states including Alaska, Georgia and Oklahoma, which have not been hit as hard by the virus, are beginning to allow certain businesses to reopen.


  However, others that have struggled to keep a lid on the disease, such as New York and Michigan, are keeping stay-at-home restrictions in place until at least mid-May.

Non-Resident Keralites (NoRKs) from the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries form the bulk of the 2.20 lakh persons to register online till 7 p.m. on Monday on the website of the Department of Non-Resident Keralite Affairs (NoRKA) to return to the State.
 Among the GCC countries of Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), most of the registrations from Sunday evening onwards on the www.registernorkaroots.org are from the UAE. NoRKA sources said they were yet to analyse the countrywise breakup of those who had enrolled.
 The process was launched for making quarantine arrangements on their return to Kerala. The registration is available round the clock and no date has been fixed for closure.
 The response to the government’s request for registration, despite it being made clear that no priority would be accorded to those who registered early, has surprised the authorities. The registration touched 30,000 in two hours after it was opened on Sunday evening. It went up to 1.5 lakh on Monday noon and crossed the two-lakh mark in the evening.
 According to official estimates, there are 33 lakh NoRKs in various countries, including 22 lakh from the Gulf region. The government is expecting around three to 5.5 lakh of them to return once the flight services are resumed to Kerala. About 1.4 lakh beds have been identified in government and private healthcare facilities in the State. The Public Works Department has already examined the facilities identified as COVID care centres.
 ## Criteria
 As per the guidelines issued by the government, the NoRKs who are returning will have to get tested in the country they are staying and should carry with them COVID-19 negative certificates.

I usually write a “thankful” column around Thanksgiving, as do many writers. It’s an easy way to give thanks, while also clearing our pockets of all sorts of little notes we save throughout the year.


  Thanksgiving is more than six months away. We truly don’t know if we’ll be carving turkey and arguing about politics with relatives in person, or if we’ll be fighting off the virus again within our own four walls. So, why wait?


  I am thankful for truck drivers and other shippers who are so under- appreciated, and yet so essential. Some of us ran out of toilet paper a few weeks ago, conducting a futile search for Sears catalogs. (When did they stop making those, and why didn’t someone tell me?) But thanks to our freight haulers, our beloved Charmin soon returned to the shelves. A grateful nation thanks you.


  I am thankful I recorded about 15 episodes of “Whose Line Is It Anyway” that I never got around to watching last year. I may need those guys to make me laugh again next year if this darn virus returns.


  I am thankful that my wife is a good cook, and always puts leftovers in the freezer. Some great Sunday dinners from last fall sure have tasted good during the quarantine.


  I am thankful for postal workers. The mail carrier is the only “outsider” who has visited my property in more than a month. In my callous youth, I would make fun of the old-timers who looked forward to “the mail” every day. Looks like I’ve become an old-timer.


  I am thankful for first responders. They signed up for hazardous duty, but they didn’t see a pandemic coming. Plus, in my neck of the woods, they have dealt with tornadoes too. If we ever get this economy straightened out, they should be among the first to get a raise.


  I am thankful for retail workers who have loyally and patiently stocked shelves and guided customers in and out of the checkout lines. We have taken you for granted for a long time. We should never do that again.


  I am thankful for the small business owners who are doing all they can to stay open. Many of them were already struggling, and this has only made it worse. Will they be able to reopen when the time is right? I hope and pray they can.


  I am thankful that my children are grown. Yes, this is selfish, but I don’t envy those who have been trying to challenge, educate, and entertain their children. All of this, plus having to work from home, or figure out child care. I guess you can understand why I’m thankful my nest is empty. And no, I’m not a grandparent yet, so my payback is surely coming. When it does, feel free to laugh at me.


  I am thankful that my insurance company realizes that I’m driving about 90 percent less than usual. They are giving me a 15 percent rebate for April and May. That math doesn’t quite match up, but at least it’s something.


  I would be thankful that gas prices are at rock bottom, but since I haven’t needed to buy gas in six weeks, it hasn’t affected me at all. I’m all gassed up, with no place to go.


  I am thankful that I can work from home, although it might spoil me. I have a feeling that when I return to my workplace, pants and shoes will be required, and pajamas will be frowned upon.


  I am thankful there is practically nothing on my calendar for the rest of the year. Sure, I have daily and weekly deadlines for my broadcasting and newspaper gigs, but there are no appointments. Zero. For the first time in my life, my dentist canceled on me. It’s usually the other way around.


  I am thankful that with fewer cars on the road, our air quality is better. I’ll take a silver lining anywhere I can.


  I am thankful that the pandemic has pretty much put robocallers out of business. Don’t let your guard down though. The scammers are coming after your stimulus check.


  I am thankful my wife knows how to cut my hair.


  Of course, I’m leaving out numerous folks for whom I should give thanks. Just know that if you protect us, patch and build our roads, heal our mind, body and spirit, keep our medical facilities clean, maintain and repair our utilities, help put food on our tables, help keep our land beautiful, work with those who are less fortunate, or volunteer in any way, I am thankful for you too.


  Let’s hope and pray this is once in a lifetime. In the very near future, I want to write a column titled, “I am thankful the Braves are back!”

The reusable segment is one of the leading packaging types with the highest market share in the Asia Pacific automotive parts packaging market. Reusable packaging, commonly known as returnable packaging is packaging materials that are capable of being reused in the manufacturing & distribution cycle. It involves materials like crates, racks, and pallets. Generally, the reusable packaging is used by automotive manufacturers for the shipment of body parts particularly, between component suppliers and assembly plants. The significance of these packaging systems lies in the mutual effort between the parties to maximize the container usage by evading the probabilities of them to get lost, misplaces, or forgotten. In the highly competitive automotive industry, the manufacturers are following lean manufacturing process to minimize waste throughout their process to cut costs. Reusable packaging helps in reducing inventory cost.

The airstrike is the fourth in Syria in less than a month, despite the coronavirus pandemic gripping the region, and comes amid rising tensions between Israel and Lebanon's militant Hezbollah group in Syria as well as along the Lebanon-Israel border.
 The Syrian military statement, carried by state TV, gave no other details about the attack or what it targeted specifically. Syria's state SANA news agency said shrapnel from the Israeli missiles hit homes in the Damascus suburbs of Hajira and Adlieh, killing three people there and wounding four. Both areas are close to the Sayyida Zeinab suburb that is home to a holy Shiite shrine and Iran-backed fighters have a presence there, according to opposition activists.

Experts say the scope of the problem in Brazil behind bars is unclear because only 682 of the country’s more than 773,000 prisoners have been tested.


  Drauzio Varella, a doctor who has studied and written books about the health care needs of prisoners in Brazil, said a disproportionate number suffer from serious conditions, including diabetes, obesity and hypertension.


  “Prisons in Brazil often have double or triple the capacity they were built for, with people sleeping on the floor,” he said. “One person coughing can infect everyone else.”


  Even with the releases, tensions are escalating inside several Brazil facilities, where some gang leaders are threatening violent rebellions and others have smuggled out messages to relatives saying they’re going hungry.


  A group of gang members detained at a prison in Minas Gerais state recently recorded a video calling on all criminal gangs, which hold considerable sway inside Brazilian prisons, to join forces to wage “war against the government.”


  Reading from a statement, one of the prisoners said they were not being provided with medicine and complained about rancid food. He threatened to direct gang members outside to set buses on fire and execute prison guards as detainees standing behind him mimicked a decapitation.


  “This virus that is circulating around the world is going to kill many brothers in prison,” he said. “We’re prepared to knock down these prisons.”


  A state official said in a statement that the men in the video had been identified and that authorities had confiscated the cellphone used to make the video.


  To prevent transmission of the virus, officials in Brazil have suspended visits from relatives and lawyers and sought to step up hygiene measures at federal and state prisons.


  While Brazilian judges have approved thousands of early-release petitions, top Justice Ministry officials have said it would be a mistake to release prisoners en masse, arguing that would create risks to public safety.


  Prisoner advocates say it is more risky for the inmates to remain in prisons.


  Pastoral Carcerária Nacional, a Christian organization that supports prisoners and their families, said many relatives of the incarcerated have been barred from providing them with food and hygiene items.


  “Prisoners get the bulk of material support from what their families can bring, because the food they are given inside is terrible and scarce,” said Sister Petra Silvia Pfaller, the group’s coordinator. “Even before the pandemic they were already going hungry.”


  Andrelina Amelia Ferreira, who heads the Mothers of Jail Movement in São Paulo, said she had received hundreds of messages from women alarmed about the tidbits of information they have gleaned from prisons that are now inaccessible.


  One woman received a handwritten note from her husband, who reported running a high fever and having body aches. Lacking enough food, he told her, had prompted him to eat clumps of toilet paper and toothpaste.


  “I’m scared I will die in prison,” the note said. “I’m starving in this damn place.”


  Vincent Ballon, the top expert on detention issues at the International Committee of the Red Cross, said the coronavirus crisis should prompt governments across the world to reconsider the laws and policies that have led to overcrowded and poorly run prisons in the first place.

Asserting that the battle against COVID-19 is going to be a long- drawn affair, Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy said Andhra Pradesh stood first in the country in conducting tests.


  Mr. Jagan pegged the number of tests at 1,396 per million population, and the total number done so far at 74,551.


  Addressing the public through video-conference from his camp office on Monday, he said infected persons should not be treated as untouchables lest they should suffer from the social stigma, and insisted that no one was safe. “It is like any fever but those with low immunity need to be extra cautious,” he added..


  Nine viral research and diagnostic laboratories and 44 TrueNat facilities had been set up in the State since the outbreak of COVID, the CM said.


  Mr. Jagan said 63 mandals were in the red zone and 54 and 559 mandals were in orange and green zones respectively and five critical care hospitals were established.


  He observed that 80% of the infected persons might never exhibit any symptoms and only 14% would require hospitalisation. The positivity rate in the red and orange zones was 1.61%.


  The Chief Minister said of the 40,000 beds, 25,000 were single isolation ones and adequate number of personal protective equipment were distributed to doctors, paramedics and others serving the masses at great personal risk.


  ## Telemedicine centres


  The government had set up 14,410 telemedicine call centres apart from filling doctor, nurse and lab technician posts.

Despite recent progress, the majority of US states don't yet have sufficient COVID-19 testing capacity to consider relaxing stay-at-home orders after May 1, according to an analysis by Harvard researchers and the health news site Stat.
 It directly contradicts the position held by President Donald Trump that the US has caught up after months of fumbling and is now "doing a great job in testing."
 In reality, just 19 states are ready, according to the analysis, including Alaska and Montana which have been relatively spared from the pandemic.
 On the other hand, 31 states and the District of Columbia are well behind. The worst hit, New York, will need to perform between 130,000 to 155,000 tests every day, compared to the average of 20,000 per day around mid April.
 Georgia, which began to re-open some non-essential businesses this weekend, has a testing deficit of about 5,000 tests per day.
 The Harvard team , which said it based its recommendations on realistic goals, estimated that the US needs to be able to perform at least 500,000 tests a day to safely reopen. The group worked off a Los Alamos National Laboratory model that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) consults.
 Ashish Jha, director of the Harvard Global Health Institute, said the news wasn't all bad because the number of tests has been steadily increasing. 300,000 were reported on Saturday and 256,000 on Sunday, according to the Covid Tracking Project.
 "Testing was stuck forever. Now finally starting to break loose! 4 day-trend gives me hope we may be making progress. We still have a long way to go," he wrote on Twitter.
 "If we can ramp up testing a bunch more, we can more safely ease distancing restrictions."

Can the Ryder Cup produce the same spectacle without its large partisan crowds?
 There would be spectators; it is just that they will be stuck at home on their couches. Even behind closed doors, the USA v Europe is a spectacle people will crave to follow on television and on radio.
 The Ryder Cup could be a diversion to brighten this sustained dark period when most senses of normality have been suspended.
 It is not just about brightening the mood, though. There are serious economic implications. The PGA of America and the European Tour most likely need it to be played, to satisfy lucrative television contracts which are their financial lifeblood.
 "I would not want to do anything that would hurt the financial position of the European Tour," Gallagher added. "We are unlike the PGA Tour; we don't have deep pockets like them."
 If this year's match is delayed by 12 months, Europe's next home contest is likely to be pushed back to 2023, meaning the cycle between the tour's biggest paydays would be stretched from four to five years.
 "It's fair to say that is not something that is in the financial planning," a member of the European Tour's tournament committee told me. "I think we have to play if we can."
 America's PGA Tour aims to be under way in June, while Europe may have a string of British-based events in late summer. In all probability, these tournaments will be played without fans present.
 It will be more anaemic, less atmospheric and far from perfect. The same will be said of Premier League football if it resumes without the creak of turnstiles - and of every other professional sport that ventures back in unfamiliar form.
 These are our times. Sport will have an important role to entertain and enthral whenever it is safe to resume.
 If all goes to plan, PGA Tour players will happily compete in June for millions of dollars without need for spectator ropes and it would be comforting to think they will feel the same about representing their continent or country in September.

Although all the 17 goals cannot be treated individually and in isolation, independent from one another, they are very integrative and have very strong working relationships. If one goal is affected, this would affect the outcome of other goals. This is the case with SDG3 (Good health and well-being) where COVID-19 is the main agent but its emergence has since turned everything upside down. The fundamental issue of health is in the public domain, our health is central to our livelihoods. SDG3 makes sure that everyone has health coverage, access to safe and effective medicines and vaccines, especially these times of COVID-19. This also means that the available means to make good health more than just a wish have been affected. In this regard, all the progress and targets that were beginning to bear fruit are severely threatened with erosion or they are at a standstill. For this reason, soon after the coronavirus easing and allowing people to move out, a major review might be in the offing although it’s not clear which agenda they are going to come up with.

“They were still awake and talking, which scientifically should not be possible,” he said.
 Beyond the day-to-day horror of dealing with coronavirus victims, Mahoney and Cheng are also wrestling with the loss of normal comforts, like most New Yorkers. Cheng said he missed ordering Chinese food and found many of the restaurants around him had closed indefinitely. Mahoney, a lifelong Boston Red Sox fan, feared baseball season was slipping away.
 Neither will seriously entertain visiting family members. Mahoney said he hoped to get a coronavirus test so he could see his wife, twin daughters and their baby brother this month. But that window, he said, would be brief; by the next shift, he would again be at risk of exposure and would have to isolate himself once more.
 Cheng video chats daily with his young daughter but said he had no idea when he might return home. Even when the city begins reopening, paramedics would still be at high risk of exposure, he said. He was recently reminded why he had taken pains to protect his family when his father-in-law, who was not quarantining with them, died of the virus.
 As they wait in the ambulance between calls, the men wear surgical masks, and they put them on whenever they are off-duty and go out in public. Cheng fashioned a headband that held the straps away from his ears, which he said got “shredded” by the elastic.
 Even when he is at home, Mahoney said, the feeling haunts him.
 “At the end of the day, I still feel like I’m wearing the mask,” he said.
 At the peak of the virus’ rampage through the city, paramedics were pronouncing hundreds of people dead in their homes every day. The 911 calls were constant, and many of the patients were too ill to save.
 Some days, the calls were relentless. Mahoney recalled one shift this month when he and his partner had been assigned to Brooklyn, but they were diverted almost immediately after leaving Fort Totten.
 “We got hit from the academy and just bounced from one call as soon as you hit the button,” he said. “We never made it out of Queens.”
 That pace has abated in recent days, indicating that the virus’ first wave might be ending; fewer New Yorkers were making emergency calls.
 “They’re either recovered, or most of them are dead,” he said.
 Call levels soared to record highs in early April, rising to around 7,000 a day compared with the normal 4,000.
 Now they have dropped to levels even lower than that. So many people are staying inside that injuries related to car accidents and crime, for example, have plummeted. And many people have decided against calling ambulances for maladies unrelated to the coronavirus because they are fearful they could be exposed to the illness if they go to a hospital.
 On one call last Monday, for example, Cheng and Mahoney responded to a patient who had difficulty breathing. It was unclear if the person had the coronavirus, but the medics donned their protective gear anyway.
 The patient had mostly normal vital signs and was unlikely to be admitted at a hospital, the medics said. In the end, the patient opted to stay home.
 Such calls were growing more and more common. People were scared, the paramedics said, and often they just wanted a medical professional to come and make sure they were not dying of the virus. Many of them were equally afraid of going to a hospital.

Against Luzardo’s Athletics, Carpenter got the offense in motion early. New to MLB The Show 20 before entering the tournament, Carpenter said he wanted to take advantage of the virtual Cardinals’ speed – and planned to push for extra bases, steal some. Kolten Wong opened the game at Oakland with a single, and Carpenter didn’t wait long to give the green light. Wong’s break for second created a hit-and-run for Carpenter’s No. 2 hitter, Matt Carpenter, and that Carpenter sneaked a single to right field as Wong took third. Luzardo’s starter hit Paul Goldschmidt with a backfoot slider, and, with cleanup hitter Paul DeJong, Carpenter (the real Carpenter) capitalized with a two-run double into the right-field corner.

HOUSTON -- In light of the ongoing uncertainty due to the COVID-19 pandemic the Chickasaw Development Foundation and Potters House, the winners of a 2020 Levitt AMP concert series grant, have made the difficult decision to cancel the series.
 The series, funded by a $25,000 grant from the Levitt Foundation, was set to begin on May 23rd and continue every Saturday through August 1st at Legion Lake Park.
 Organizers are saddened by this turn of events but feel that it is the safer bet for the community.
 “With hundreds of new diagnoses of the COVID-19 continuing to be reported daily across the state, we didn’t feel like beginning a concert series on May 23rd would be appropriate or responsible. After speaking with Mississippi Emergency Management, city leaders and community partners, the foundation directors and other communities facing the same challenges with their series, we’ve made the difficult decision to postpone the series until 2021,” says Sean Johnson, the director of the Chickasaw Development Foundation.
 According to Johnson, the Levitt Foundation has agreed to defer the $25,000 grant until next year, by which time the COVID-19 pandemic will hopefully be behind us.
 “We’re very appreciative of the Levitt Foundation’s generosity and expressed desire to continue to help with our shared mission of reinvigorating public spaces.”
 In addition to postponing the series grant until next year, the Levitt Foundation has opened applications for a new $5,000 grant for a single event that will be held later this summer or early fall if the situation improves. Johnson said that he is in talks with the foundation about this grant, which could include an outdoor event, or something streamed online. Johnson said also that he wants to stress that the while the series will not happen this summer, everything is in place for it to happen next summer if the situation at the time allows.
 Regarding Houston Homecoming and other events, Johnson says that as more becomes known over the next few weeks the mayor and city leaders will be looking at options on how to move forward.
 “The health, safety and well-being of our community is what is most important right now, but we’ll get through this, and when we do we’ll be on to greater things.”

There are so many distinct flavours in Mexican cuisine, but cumin is one of the most commonly used spices in regional dishes. It has a strong flavour, which Hilton’s culinary experts caution can easily overpower a dish if it is used excessively. However, when used properly, cumin adds a distinct earthy flavour and a hint of spice to food. One of the best ways to experience cumin’s rich and deep flavour is to prepare it from scratch by toasting the whole seeds on a dry pan before grinding them to use in recipes. Try sprinkling cumin on chicken or steak for flavourful fajitas, or blend the spice with roasted tomatoes and whatever vegetables you have in the fridge for a savoury salsa. Combining it with olive oil to create a sauce is another tasty tip.

The Kia Stinger was nothing short of a strategic surprise by the brand when it debuted, combining the agility of a rear-wheel-drive sports sedan with a forward-looking exterior design and premium cabin materials. The Stinger also debuted at a time when most automakers were looking at ways to build fewer sedans, not more, and instead were staking their futures on expanding their crossover and SUV offerings. The arrival of the Stinger was a bolt out of the blue from Kia, signaling that it could take on the more established premium automakers from Japan and Germany in their favored segments if it wanted to.


  Korean Car Blog now reports that the Stinger, which has been on the market since 2017, may not get a second generation, facing pressure from a number of trends that have weakened the business case for Kia's premium sports sedan.

Borussia Dortmund chief executive Hans-Joachim Watzke has warned that the Bundesliga could "go under" unless Angela Merkel's government grants permission for the German football season to resume next month despite the coronavirus pandemic.
 "It's about nothing more and nothing less than saving football," Watzke told Sky Sport News.
 "If we don't play for the next few months, the whole Bundesliga will go under. It will no longer exist in the form we have known it."
 The league ground to a halt in Germany on March 13 due to the virus outbreak, with defending champions Bayern Munich four points clear of second-placed Dortmund in the table.
 Last week, the German Football League (DFL) signalled that it is ready to resume from May 9, albeit behind closed doors and with players tested regularly for the virus.
 The DFL still needs permission from German Chancellor Merkel and the leaders of the states, who are due to meet on Thursday.
 Some leading scientists and health advisors have been highly critical of the Bundesliga's plans to resume amid the pandemic. Germany has recorded almost 6,000 coronavirus deaths.
 Watzke insists clubs are not looking for "special" treatment. "We just want to pursue our profession," he said.
 Germany's top clubs want the league to be finished by June 30 to free up an instalment of television money worth around 300 million euros ($325 million).
 Magazine Kicker claims 13 of the 36 clubs in the top two leagues are on the verge of insolvency.
 Both Werder Bremen and Schalke 04 have admitted their finances have been badly affected by the crisis.
 Former Bayern Munich president Uli Hoeness believes holding games behind closed doors -- known as 'ghost games' in German -- is the only viable alternative.
 "In principle, I consider ghost games to be questionable, but in view of the economic situation facing some clubs, they are vital," Hoeness told Kicker.
 Hoeness also backed calls for pay-per-view broadcasters Sky and DAZN to allow the nine remaining rounds of Bundesliga games to be screened on free television to help boost morale in football-mad Germany.
 With so many teams struggling financially, there are also calls for the league to adopt a salary cap.
 Fortuna Duesseldorf's CEO Thomas Roettgermann wants salaries capped because player wages are "a large part of the expenses and you are in a never-ending rat race" with other clubs.
 "It would be possible to calculate a salary cap based on the total turnover of the respective club," he told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper.
 "All clubs, indeed all over Europe, are currently prepared to talk about this topic," Roettgermann added.
 Augsburg's managing director Michael Stroell also wants a financial rethink.
 "Everyone must have realised in the past months that 'higher, faster, further' is not always the right way, and, especially in times of crisis, is enormously dangerous," Stroell told local paper the Augsburger Allgemeine.

Mr Johnson wanted, as ministers have in recent days, to emphasise what the government believes it has achieved in recent weeks - slowing the spread of the disease with distancing measures, and stopping the NHS from being overwhelmed.
 There was barely a mention of the difficulties we've heard from around the country over medics and care staff being short of the kit they need to protect themselves, what's going on behind closed doors in care homes, or the bumpy progress in testing.
 Not much acknowledgment either that other leaders, like the First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, and others in Europe, have been much more candid with the public already about how the next phase might actually look.
 He promised he would be transparent in the coming days, but would not follow them today.
 But with only a few slips into his more familiar pre-pandemic tone, branding the virus "an invisible mugger" the country was trying to wrestle to the ground, this was a serious statement from the prime minister, in exceptional times, to explain to the public Downing Street's thinking, but a speech largely designed to hold the line.

“They were still awake and talking, which scientifically should not be possible,” he said.


  Beyond the day-to-day horror of dealing with coronavirus victims, Mahoney and Cheng are also wrestling with the loss of normal comforts, like most New Yorkers. Cheng said he missed ordering Chinese food and found many of the restaurants around him had closed indefinitely. Mahoney, a lifelong Boston Red Sox fan, feared baseball season was slipping away.


  Neither will seriously entertain visiting family members. Mahoney said he hoped to get a coronavirus test so he could see his wife, twin daughters and their baby brother this month. But that window, he said, would be brief; by the next shift, he would again be at risk of exposure and would have to isolate himself once more.


  Cheng video chats daily with his young daughter but said he had no idea when he might return home. Even when the city begins reopening, paramedics would still be at high risk of exposure, he said. He was recently reminded why he had taken pains to protect his family when his father-in-law, who was not quarantining with them, died of the virus.


  As they wait in the ambulance between calls, the men wear surgical masks, and they put them on whenever they are off-duty and go out in public. Cheng fashioned a headband that held the straps away from his ears, which he said got “shredded” by the elastic.


  Even when he is at home, Mahoney said, the feeling haunts him.


  “At the end of the day, I still feel like I’m wearing the mask,” he said.


  At the peak of the virus’ rampage through the city, paramedics were pronouncing hundreds of people dead in their homes every day. The 911 calls were constant, and many of the patients were too ill to save.


  Some days, the calls were relentless. Mahoney recalled one shift this month when he and his partner had been assigned to Brooklyn, but they were diverted almost immediately after leaving Fort Totten.


  “We got hit from the academy and just bounced from one call as soon as you hit the button,” he said. “We never made it out of Queens.”


  That pace has abated in recent days, indicating that the virus’ first wave might be ending; fewer New Yorkers were making emergency calls.


  “They’re either recovered, or most of them are dead,” he said.


  Call levels soared to record highs in early April, rising to around 7,000 a day compared with the normal 4,000.


  Now they have dropped to levels even lower than that. So many people are staying inside that injuries related to car accidents and crime, for example, have plummeted. And many people have decided against calling ambulances for maladies unrelated to the coronavirus because they are fearful they could be exposed to the illness if they go to a hospital.


  On one call last Monday, for example, Cheng and Mahoney responded to a patient who had difficulty breathing. It was unclear if the person had the coronavirus, but the medics donned their protective gear anyway.


  The patient had mostly normal vital signs and was unlikely to be admitted at a hospital, the medics said. In the end, the patient opted to stay home.


  Such calls were growing more and more common. People were scared, the paramedics said, and often they just wanted a medical professional to come and make sure they were not dying of the virus. Many of them were equally afraid of going to a hospital.

Responding to a tweet by Congress leader Udit Raj, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) on Monday said that no coronavirus test kits have been procured at Rs 4,500 a piece. The country's apex health research body also shared the price range approved by it for the rapid test kits and RT-PCR kits used in the detection of the COVID-19 infection."This is Fake News. Price range approved by ICMR is Rs 740-1150 for RT-PCR and Rs 528-795 for Rapid Test. No test has been procured at Rs 4500. Any Indian company wanting to supply at lower rates is welcome to contact ICMR or Ms Anu Nagar, JS Health Research(011-23736222)," the ICMR said in a tweet on Monday morning, responding to a post by the Congress leader. Raj had posted a screenshot of a tweet on Sunday which claimed that even though 17 companies were ready to manufacture and offer coronavirus test kits for Rs 500, the prime minister granted the tender for COVID-19 testing kits to a Gujarat-based company at the price of Rs 4,500 per kit. The former Lok Sabha member had, however, added that, "This is being circulated on social media. It is difficult to say what is the truth." Meanwhile, the ICMR on Monday asked states to stop using the COVID-19 rapid antibody test kits procured from two Chinese companies and return them to be sent back to the suppliers.In an advisory sent to chief secretaries of all states and Union Territories on Monday, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) said it "evaluated the kits of Guangzhou Wondfo Biotech and Zhuhai Livson Diagnostics in field conditions. The results have shown wide variation in their sensitivity, despite early promise of good performance for surveillance purpose". "In view of this, states are advised to stop using these kits, procured from the above mentioned companies and return them to be sent back to the suppliers," it said.The health ministry on its part issued a statement saying that ICMR has not made any payment whatsoever in respect of these supplies. "Because of the due process followed (not going for procurement with 100 per cent advance amount), the GoI does not stand to lose a single rupee," the ministry said. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi also, earlier in the day, had alleged that some people were indulging in profiteering while supplying rapid test kits for COVID-19 to the government.

Still, though, that loss would be felt, as Krejci could center top lines for many teams around the NHL, and the Bruins have been in the fortunate spot of having him pivot the second unit.

On Friday, the World Health Organization warned against relying on these tests for policy decisions. While countries such as Italy have even floated the idea of “immunity passports” for people who test positive, WHO officials noted that it is not known to what extent people carrying antibodies are immune to the virus.


  (The WHO on Saturday backed off an earlier assertion that people with antibodies may not be immune at all.)


  But widespread testing has started nonetheless, and important decisions are likely to flow from the results. The National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and virtually every university with an epidemiology department has begun antibody surveys in communities across the United States.


  “It seems like all of a sudden, everybody just decided that antibody tests are going to give them some grand answer,” said Dr. Michael Osterholm, an infectious diseases expert at the University of Minnesota.


  The goal of most of these projects is to get a handle on the size and nature of the epidemic here rather than to guide decisions about reopening the economy. But now scientists are racing to fine-tune the tests and learn more about what having antibodies actually means, both for the patient and for the community.


  Many questions raised by these initiatives have no easy answers: When will we achieve “herd immunity”? How quickly does the virus spread? How long does immunity last, and how strong is it?

Although developing countries welcome and appreciate green funding from international donors, COVID-19 has come as a wake-up call for developing countries to fund the national adaptation programmes from within. Then the donors would come to support what is already on the ground not on paper. As it sands right now, developing countries would now rely on the availability of funds for their adaptation programmes to continue or even new ones to kick- start. Promised funding may still come or can be reduced or even suspended and this would spell doom for the already incapacitated developing countries that rely on food hand-outs in times of crises most of the times.

Bank of Japan lifts bond-buying limit, leaves policy rate unchanged. US Dollar Index steadies above 100, stays in negative territory. 10-year US Treasury bond yield gains more than 7% on Monday. The USD/JPY pair started the week under modest selling pressure and dropped to its lowest level in more than ten days at 107.00. However, with the market sentiment remaining positive in the second half of the day, the JPY struggled to preserve its strength and the pair staged a rebound. As of writing, the pair was down 0.23% on a daily basis at 107.25. BoJ expands loan programme to support economy Following its April monetary policy meeting, the Bank of Japan (BoJ) decided to keep its policy rate unchanged at -0.1% as expected. The BoJ also pledged to buy an unlimited amount of government bonds and said that it will purchase up to 20 trillion JPY of corporate bonds.Nevertheless, the market reaction to the BoJ's announcements was relatively muted as these changes in the policy were already priced in. In the early trading hours of the American session, the 10-year US Treasury bond yield extended its rebound after Wall Street's main indexes started the day higher and allowed the pair to erase a portion of its daily losses. At the moment, the 10-year US T-bond yield is up more than 7% on the day and the S&P 500 is gaining 1.25%. Meanwhile, the upbeat market mood on Monday weighed on the greenback as well and made it difficult for the pair to extend its rebound.

FALL RIVER, Mass. -- When one thinks of Brian Fox's artwork, images of rock stars and sports legends come to mind. Not saints or Knights Templar, and definitely not stained glass windows.


   


  Turns out, Fox has been designing stained glass images for New England Stained Glass for the past 25 years. But his latest piece for the company is a true showstopper: a stained glass window for race car driver Alexis DeJoria's Newport mansion.


   


  The stained glass window at the DeJoria mansion with Fox's image based on the concept of Knights Templar was securely placed over a bathtub in the mansion earlier this month. Fox said the commission for the piece came to him through New England Stained Glass owner Jim Donahue, who reached out after DeJoria's mother, Jamie Briggs DeJoria, contacted him with a commission for a stained glass for the mansion.


   


  "The [John] La Farge stained glass windows at the Breakers mansion inspired us to have one made for our home. The one Brian created is better than we ever imagined," said Jamie Briggs DeJoria.


   


  The process started more than a year ago, when Donahue and Jamie Briggs DeJoria, who also happens to be an interior designer, visited Fox's studio at Commonwealth Landing to discuss ideas for the image, he said.


   


  "It took months to come up with the right design," Fox said of the process of refining the image before Donohue's team took over cutting the pieces of colored glass to the right shapes to fuse together to make the design.


   


  "We put our heads together, it was a lot of sketching, a lot of drawings. Then New England Stained Glass cuts out all those pieces of glass. It's a very painstaking process [of cutting them out]," added Fox.


   


  When it was all put together, Fox said he stepped in again to paint on the glass, adding even more dimension to the piece. "It was a cool combination of doing all the colored glass and then painting on top of it. It's a really cool end product."


   


  Though it looks like a window, the piece was placed in an alcove that was created for it over the bathtub with a light behind the stained glass piece. The DeJoria family purchased mansion, called Ocean Lawn, in 2017. Built in the Gilded Age, it was the residence of the Firestone family.


   


  Fox, who said New England Stained Glass has called on him many times over the past 25 years for various designs for stained glass pieces, was pleased with the results of this piece.


   


  "I'm happy if the client is happy. New England Stained Glass is great to work with and they bring a lot of creativity to the table, and Jamie brought a lot of creativity to the table so it was really a lot of fun working with everybody involved in this project," he said.


   


  Jamie Briggs DeJoria echoed his sentiment.


   


  "New England Stained Glass and Brian were the perfect people to work with," she said. "They did such a wonderful job we are having them design and build two more custom windows."


   


  "Amazing art work and window," added Alexis DeJoria.


   


  On Tuesday, Fox announced he had even more to celebrate when he was named as the United States Sports Academy's 2020 Artist of the Year. Fox, who has painted the likes of Derek Jeter, Rob Gronkowski and Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps, is the recipient of an award that was bestowed to the great sports artists who inspired him, including LeRoy Neiman.


   


  "Being recognized by a prestigious organization such as the U.S. Sports Academy is an incredible honor. I am as humbled as I am grateful," Fox said. "Having been selected for this honor is truly one of the highlights of my career, especially given that I'm in the company of such talented artists as Stephen Holland and LeRoy Neiman -- previous recipients -- who have positively influenced my life's work."


   


  In a press release, the academy credited Fox's "meticulous attention to detail and uncanny ability to capture the iconic expressions of his larger- than-life subjects...." Awards of Sport "honor those who have made significant contributions to sport in categories as diverse as the artist and the athlete."


   


  Fox will have to wait until the Academy's Awards of Sport event in November, in Daphne, Ala., to fully enjoy that accolade, but for now, he's focusing on current projects and the success of completed projects including the stained glass windows.

“Heads-up,” a radio barked. “Possible COVID.”


  The paramedics, Sean Mahoney and Kenny Cheng, rushed to the apartment building; donned gowns, goggles and face masks; and restarted the patient’s heart. But then the person crashed. The ambulance doors closed as Cheng frantically began chest compressions. Moments later, the patient was dead.


  Such is the disturbing new normal for the city’s paramedics, whose days can be mundane until — suddenly — they are not.


  The peak of the coronavirus epidemic in New York City — when paramedics were declaring scores of people dead a day — has passed, at least for now. Yet the virus still casts a shadow over everything they do. And when it resurfaces, it does so swiftly and with a vengeance.


  Like the rest of the city, paramedics are facing an unnerving uncertainty: When can they see their loved ones again? When, if ever, can they return to normal? And what if the virus comes back when they do?


  “It’s a little bit overwhelming,” said Mahoney, 40. “But that’s what we signed up to do, right?”


  Nearly two months into the coronavirus crisis, the strain has taken a heavy emotional and physical toll on paramedics. The city employs around 4,500 paramedics and emergency medical technicians, who are buttressed by privately employed ambulance crews paid by hospitals. Although the city’s medics work for the Fire Department, they are paid significantly less than firefighters and do not receive the same benefits.


  For weeks, they have worked exhausting days trying to save people, facing the threat of exposure each time they respond to a call. And after their shifts, they have had to isolate themselves at home to protect their relatives, spouses and children from infection.

Every team in every sport across the board was hoping to have a spring season, before the PIAA put the kibosh on all athletics for the remainder of the school year because of the COVID-19 pandemic.
 But if there was one Lancaster-Lebanon League squad that was truly looking forward to this spring sports season, you could make a terrific argument that it was Lampeter-Strasburg’s softball team.
 Coach Gene Charles and his Pioneers were set to return eight full-time starters from a team that went 28-2 and reached the PIAA Class 5A championship game last spring — one year after L-S went 23-5 and won PIAA gold.

Sumac is most commonly recognised in the Middle Eastern za’atar seasoning, which is a mix of dried herbs, toasted sesame seeds, salt and sumac. It has a tangy, sour flavour and it is sometimes used as a substitute for lemon juice to add a bit of tartness to dishes such as hummus or a salad dressing. Use it to brighten roasted, baked or even fried potatoes, or sprinkle it on top of avocado toast for some extra “zing.” It’s also nice on pita bread brushed with olive oil. Alternatively, to satisfy a sweet craving, Hilton culinary experts suggest trying sumac mixed with honey and drizzled on ice cream. You can also try it in a pastry; wrap a fruit puree in filo dough, then brush the dough with sumac-infused honey before baking it to create a delightful sweet treat.

With another week of Gov. Tim Walz’s stay-at-home order under our belts, I want to provide an update on some of the unprecedented decisions the city management has had to make regarding city services due to the economic impacts of COVID-19.


  As you may know, the city’s recreational facilities, including the Hopkins Activity Center, the Hopkins Center for the Arts and the Hopkins Pavilion, were closed in March by state mandate and as a best practice for public health.


  At this time, we are unsure of how long these facilities will be closed and those services impacted. We do know, however, that the city is experiencing revenue shortfalls as a result of the closures.


  To help mitigate these losses, city management has taken steps to reduce expenditures by temporarily reducing services at these facilities, which will take place over the next month. Some of these reductions affect staffing.


  I want to emphasize that these reductions are in no way a reflection of the quality of our staff, their value to the city or the importance of the services they provide to you, our community. I am sure many of you have had a positive experience with a staff member at one of our facilities and can reinforce this sentiment.


  I also want to mention that this is not the order in which we would make reductions in a different budget situation. We are making these reductions due to the specifics of this situation relating to group gatherings and the gathering of vulnerable populations. They are temporary measures focused on reducing short-term financial impacts to the city.


  These reductions are fluid, and will be monitored on a week-by-week basis and adjusted as necessary.


  In addition, I want to let you know that Hennepin County has delayed tax payments until July and our Hopkins City Council has initiated an emergency ordinance to remove utility payment late fees until July as well, with the hope of assisting you all through the coming months.


  These changes will affect the city’s liquidity. Though the city is in a strong enough position to handle the delayed payments and loss of late fees, city management has asked all staff to hold back on discretionary spending.


  While the situation we find ourselves in is not ideal, I want to remind you that nothing is permanent. Our efforts through the governor’s stay-at-home order seem to be working and I hope to see you all out and about in our community sooner rather than later.


  In the meantime, our Hopkins local businesses, including our restaurants and bars, still need our support. Consider purchasing a gift card for later use and/or using curbside pick-up or delivery options so that our small business owners can survive this uncertain time.


  I would like to share my positive thoughts with our students, teachers and school staff members that are being innovative and working to continue education through distance learning. It is a challenging time and with the announcement that the existing distance learning for schools will continue through the end of this school year, my thoughts go out especially to the seniors this year. I know this a time of gatherings and events that you have been looking forward to sharing with your classmates. I ask that you remember how you will forever be connected as the Class of 2020. The class that took this struggle and allowed it to make you stronger.


  And a message to every resident in Hopkins, I know you all are getting a little stir-crazy and would like life to get back to normal – I am feeling the same way! But I want to remind you to be kind to one another, especially your neighbors. We are all facing similar challenges, but we all handle it in different ways. We could all use a little grace. Please be patient with one another. This is only temporary. I challenge you to do something nice for someone. An encouraging note sent, a phone call to just chat, offering to share some treats …


  Thank you for doing your part to help our community weather this extraordinarily challenging time. I appreciate every one of you.


  _Jason Gadd is the mayor of Hopkins_

The trial enrolled its first patient this past week, and preliminary results could be available in a few months, she said.
 “It’s totally out of the box, which is how good ideas often start,” said Nachman, associate dean for research at the Renaissance School, which is part of the State University of New York.
 The gender gap in coronavirus survival became apparent early in the pandemic. Reports from China indicated men were dying at higher rates, but the disparity was attributed to higher smoking rates. But the outcomes were consistent in other countries, with men in Italy dying at higher rates than women and men in New York City dying at nearly double the rate of women.
 Scientists who study sex differences say that both biological differences in immunity, as well as behavioral factors, are at play. Men smoke more almost everywhere, they say; men also wash their hands less. While women appear to have more robust immune systems, these experts say, the causes are complex and multifactorial, and hormones are only part of the picture.
 If such sex hormones were the primary protective factor for women, then elderly women with COVID-19 would fare as poorly as elderly men, because women’s reproductive hormones plummet after menopause, said Sabra Klein, a scientist who studies sex differences in viral infections and vaccination responses at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.
 But that’s not the case, she said.

The Srikakulam district administration is leaving no stone unturned to control COVID-19 spread in the red zone of Patapatnam mandal where four positive cases were identified a couple of days ago.
 All the 12,500 residents of 18 villages, including Kaguvada Sidi, Tamara, Timara, Patapatnam and others have been told to remain indoors. Special teams with 23 doctors, 265 ASHA workers and 265 volunteers have been formed to conduct medical tests for all the families.
 All essential goods, including milk and vegetables, were being supplied at the doorsteps of the people and residents had been asked not come on to the streets even during the early hours. A special control room had been set up in Patapatnam to monitor the situation in the containment area.
 The district administration has focussed on the situation in Palakonda mandal as it is adjacent to Patapatnam. Palakonda panchayat Commissioner L. Pushpanatham said that COVID-19 survey was being taken up in the entire mandal and data of persons aged above 65 years was being prepared. He said that health condition of senior citizens was being closely monitored.
 Srikakulam Collector J.

He directed RIMS hospital authorities to establish a laboratory to conduct COVID-19 tests in the district itself.

The Madison Center is a nonprofit pediatric speech and occupational therapy center in Excelsior. Like many other businesses, it has had to close its doors due to COVID-19. Now, the center offers its services through the telecare platform thera-LINK.


  The therapists reached out to clients to let them know the clinic would close and would offer virtual services, Jennifer Schmitz, one of the speech therapists said, adding that services look just about the same as in the clinic.


  Staff members have seen fewer clients since pivoting to virtual sessions, Schmitz said. Therapists are seeing about 25-50% of their normal caseload. Families are adjusting to a lot right now including distance learning, said Courtney Fischer, one of the occupational therapists at the center.


  “Adding one more thing on top of it can feel like a lot,” she added.


  The therapists see clients either once or twice a week and most families are staying consistent or are trying one session a week, Schmitz added. Another speech therapist is seeing an increase in clients who want to start teletherapy after taking the first few weeks of quarantine off, Schmitz said.


  Therapists see clients between the ages of 2 and 20, Schmitz said. Clients seeing a speech therapist have either speech, language, fluency or social needs.


  Occupational therapy is more movement and task-oriented, Fischer said. The goal is for children to participate in their daily activities as independently and successfully as possible. That means being able to learn, play, socialize and participate in their family dynamics, she added. Therapists see children with a variety of diagnoses such as autism, ADHD, Down syndrome and anxiety and children who are not formally diagnosed, she added.


  In the switch to virtual sessions, families need a device and an internet connection, Schmitz said. For occupational therapy “we can use whatever they have at home” because it is about client’s daily occupations, Fischer said.


  Therapy at the Madison Center is play-based, Schmitz and Fischer said.


  Overall participation and attention is a challenge in virtual sessions, Schmitz said. In the clinic, they can get up and move, play games and adjust to how the client is feeling that day. It’s difficult to redirect the younger clients. Now, parents need to be present in sessions for children 3-5 years old. In clinic sessions parents were not involved, she said.


  Therapists are trying to get creative in virtual therapy to target the same skills as in clinic, just in different ways, Fischer said. Occupational therapists are providing verbal instruction for clients. That could be playing a version of Scattergories, education on emotional regulation with worksheets or doing guided core exercises on the floor.


  “We’re limited by what we really can do,” Fischer said. When doing exercises, she can’t always see their whole body to analyze if they’re doing the correct positioning and she cannot guide their movements, she said, adding there is still a lot they can do.


  Connecting with the families and sharing the week’s activities and resources so parents can print it out for the session has been going well, Schmitz said. Therapists have been checking in to see how their clients are doing. If they can do anything to support them even if it’s not a direct session. “So, that’s been encouraging,” she said.


  Now that sessions are taking place at home parents are able to overhear what they are working on and hopefully implement the information more easily, Fischer said. Clients are also in their natural environment so they can write themselves reminders that won’t get lost in the transition from the clinic to home.


  It was unexpected how excited some of the clients were to see them, Fischer said, adding they are socially limited right now because they aren’t able to see friends or go to school.

MotoGP chief Carmelo Ezpeleta said on Monday he was hopeful the season would start in July after having to cancel or postpone the opening eight races due to the coronavirus pandemic.
 "Right now we are optimistic to make a season between July and November," Ezpeleta, the CEO of MotoGP promoter Dorna, told broadcasters BT Sport.
 "If it's possible then we will be able to but it depends on the situation because we need to take care about different things," he added.
 Ezpeleta said the two other options being considered are commencing in September as well as starting later in the year.
 Six of the of the season's 12 races not to be postponed or cancelled are set to be held in Europe.
 Despite his positivity the Spaniard said having borders closed across the world poses a problem.
 "One is any individual country will need to allow us to do it when the doors are open and second is the possibility of travelling from one country to another," he said.
 "In principle we will concentrate on trying to make a championship in Europe.
 "Depending on what the situation is, we will consider the possibility of going to the end of they year if the countries allow us to do it," he added.
 Ezpeleta said if the campaign is to start then the races will be held behind closed doors.
 "We consider right now the most possible scenario is without spectators because unfortunately we don't think for this season it will be possible unless there is vaccine. It will be difficult to have spectators," he said.
 Confirmation regarding the MotoGP season will be published in the coming days, a source told AFP.

In an unprecedented move, New York has canceled its Democratic presidential primary that was scheduled for June 23 amid the coronavirus pandemic.


  The Democratic members of the State’s Board of Elections voted Monday to nix the primary. New York will still hold its congressional and state-level primaries on June 23.


  Commissioner Andrew Spano said he had pondered at length, reaching a decision just Monday morning. He said he worried about potentially forcing voters and poll workers to choose between their democratic duty and their health. While there will still be other offices on the ballot, Spano reasoned it made sense to give voters an opportunity to choose in contested races but not to “have anyone on the ballot just for the purposes of issues at a convention.”


  New York Democratic Party chair Jay Jacobs has said that the cancellation of the state’s presidential primary would mean a lower expected turnout and a reduced need for polling places.

Tolan's prospects looked bleak when his dad dragged him out of the water on the evening of Friday, April 17.
 He was revived by his dad at their Mirfield home and then helped by paramedics.
 When he arrived at Calderdale Royal Hospital he was put into a induced coma after a CT scan showed he had swelling to the brain.
 Fears he may be suffering significant brain damage saw him transferred to Leeds General Infirmary's intensive care unit.
 Medics there told the family to prepare for the worst and after a couple of days in intensive care they recommended he was read his 'last rites' \- a Catholic tradition of allowing a priest to say final prayers shortly before death.
 But just a day later Tolan showed signs of improvement and by the end of the week he had been woken with apparently no serious damage done.
 He was eventually discharged from hospital just six days after being pulled unresponsive from that pool.
 Martin said the paramedics, doctors and nurses had all told him he'd saved his son's life.
 He recalled: "I was standing close to the hot tub and we were talking about treating ourselves to a takeaway when I noticed Tolan was at the bottom of the pool face down.
 "He sometimes does that anyway, as he's a strong swimmer, but I walked over to check. When I grabbed him I realised there was something wrong.
