Officials said federal emergency and health workers would partner with states to set up community centers capable of testing 2,000 to 4,000 people per day. The details come amid growing frustration about lack of access to testing and concerns the virus is spreading undetected.The death toll in the United States climbed to 61, while infections neared 3,000.The Peace Corps is telling its volunteers around the world that it is suspending all operations globally and evacuating all volunteers in light of the spread of the new coronavirus.In an open letter to volunteers posted Sunday on its website, the federal agency‚Äôs director, Jody Olsen, says the decision follows recent evacuations in China and Mongolia due to the outbreak.Olsen says that with evacuations now underway at other posts and travel becoming more challenging by the day, the agency decided to expand the suspension and evacuations.Olsen‚Äôs statement stressed that posts would not close, but didn‚Äôt provide a timeline for resuming operations.As of September 2019, the service program run by the U.S. government said it operates in more than 60 countries and has more than 7,300 volunteers and trainees.The Peace Corps was established in 1961 during the Kennedy administration as a government-run volunteer program serving nations around the world.Iranian state TV says the new coronavirus has killed another 129 people, pushing the country‚Äôs death toll to 853 amid 14,991 confirmed cases. Iran is struggling to contain the worst outbreak in the Middle East. Monday saw the biggest one-day rise in the death toll since the epidemic began. Even senior officials have been infected.The real numbers may be even higher, as some have questioned the government‚Äôs reporting.Two Iranian news agencies said a 78-year-old member of the clerical body that chooses the country‚Äôs supreme leader died from the illness, the latest of several senior Iranian officials to have been infected.People around the world began holing up at home, stocking up on supplies and keeping a wary eye on how close they got to friends and neighbors as fear of the fast-spreading coronavirus sunk in.While it‚Äôs a reality Northeast Asia has been living with for months, there were signs across the region that the focus of the pandemic was shifting away from its former epicenter, even as countries urged vigilance against hard-won drops in infections.South Korea reported 74 additional cases of the new coronavirus Monday, continuing its downward trend. The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the additional cases brought the country‚Äôs total to 8,236. It has 75 deaths.The country‚Äôs central bank executed an emergency rate cut of 0.5 percentage point to help ease the economic fallout from the virus.The Bank of Korea‚Äôs move on Monday brought its policy rate to an all-time low of 0.75% amid concerns that the global spread of COVID-19 will rattle South Korea‚Äôs trade-dependent economy.South Korea has the fourth- highest number of cases worldwide, but its new cases have been declining recently. About 90% of cases in South Korea are in the southeastern city of Daegu and nearby areas.China is relaxing travel restrictions in the hardest- hit virus province of Wuhan, sending thousands of workers back to jobs at factories desperate to get production going again.The official Xinhua News Agency reported Monday that cities just outside the epicenter of Wuhan were chartering buses to send back to work residents who had returned home for the Lunar New Year in late January.The move comes as Chinese officials say the outbreak that spread from Wuhan starting in December has mostly run its course domestically, while they remain vigilant against imported cases.The outbreak of COVID-19 has had a devastating effect on China‚Äôs service sector and industries from autos to cell phones, although President Xi Jinping has pledged that economic growth targets for the year will still be met.China‚Äôs consumer spending and other business activity fell more than expected in January and February as it fought the virus outbreak, prompting some forecasters to warn this year‚Äôs economic growth might slump to its weakest level since the 1970s.Retail sales fell 20.5% from a year ago after shopping malls and other businesses were closed in late January.Factory output declined by a record 13.5% after the Lunar New Year holiday was extended to keep manufacturers and offices closed.Economists warned manufacturers and others will struggle despite official efforts to reopen factories and other businesses in many areas while preventing a new spike in infections.Japan‚Äôs central bank is expanding its purchases of stocks, bonds and other assets and provide zero interest loans to companies running short of cash due to the virus outbreak.The measures were among many by central banks seeking to salvage economies swooning from downturns in travel and other spending as authorities impose sweeping controls to curb the spread of the virus.The BOJ‚Äôs move followed a decision by the U.S. Federal Reserve‚Äôs decision to cut its key interest rate to near zero to help boost the availability of cash and credit.The BOJ cut its key policy rate to minus 0.1% several years ago as part of a massive, prolonged effort to use cheap credit to keep the economy growing.Japan‚Äôs economy contracted at a 7.1% annual pace in the last quarter and is expected to shrink further in this quarter given the shock from the coronavirus outbreak.Lebanon has gone into lockdown and Iraqis are preparing for a curfew as part of regional efforts to contain the new coronavirus. But businesses remained open in Iran, which is battling the worst outbreak in the Mideast and where another senior official has died.The divergent approaches adopted by local authorities reflect continued uncertainty over how to slow the spread of a virus that has infected around 170,000 people worldwide and caused more than 6,500 deaths.Copyright 2020 Associated Press.

AT last we have some respite from the almost continual rain. The sky is blue, bright and populated with fluffy cumulonimbus clouds.
 We pick up my mother and after another spending spree at Toad Hall garden centre, we‚Äôre assailed on our departure by the shrieks of ring-necked parakeets (Psittacula krameri).
 Considered an agricultural pest in the Indian subcontinent, they are becoming commonplace here in the south of England.
 No one is quite sure how they have made a new home here (presumably after escaping from confinement) but we‚Äôve got them now and as long as they do not disrupt our native birds‚Äô food supply, then they are welcome. They are certainly handsome, garrulous birds.
 Red-legged partridges with an IQ of zero look surprised as we try to avoid them as they scuttle up the sides of the holloway on our descent of Aston Lane.
 We dive into the Flower Pot pub for lunch ‚Äî ham, egg and chips like no other. When we leave the pub there are those silly birds again.
 We ascend the narrow road before bracing ourselves to sail down White Hill, with its perilously leaning beech trees, and back home through Henley.
 The weather forecast seems favourable but can we trust it after last week? Well, we‚Äôre going for it come what may.
 We arrive at the Harcourt Arboretum near Nuneham Courtenay, some six miles south of Oxford. Owned by the University of Oxford, it runs to some 130 acres in total. This is my first visit and long overdue too. I‚Äôm immediately stunned by the range of trees that I see.
 Walking south from the car park, you are presented with a choice between the Arboretum Amble, a simple mile‚Äôs walk around native woodland and wildflower meadows, or a walk that winds through the Old Arboretum via a grassy path. We opt for the former.
 Peacocks and peahens wander around The Lodge and ticket office, seemingly tame. I do advise visitors to keep some distance from the showy males that can fly off the handle in a flash, especially during April‚Äôs breeding season.
 As we progress along the path, I‚Äôm taken by the amount of old English oaks that stand proud as if in protest at the din of traffic roaring up and down the A4074. In between the old trees a large tally of many species and cultivars of maple are growing. I‚Äôm stunned by the sheer number.
 Our path takes a bend to the right and heads westwards past a picnic area and a large shelter surrounded by a smallish coppice. The noise from the busy road has gone.
 Here we meet a bluebell wood so vast it defies belief. Sitting among oaks, beech and other native trees, it will be a welcome sight come late spring.
 This is part of the arboretum that consists mainly of native species, the sole exception being a roble beech, or Patagonian oak (Nothofagus obliqua), a native of Chile and Argentina and capable of reaching 50m or 170ft. I‚Äôd love to be able to travel into the future to see what becomes of it.
 Still following the now waterlogged path, we enter an area known as Lime Wood.
 A notice advises us that limes or lindens once made up a large proportion of our primeval forests. I know this to be true from pollen records so I presume that they are the small-leaved lime (Tilia cordata) and not the common lime (Tilia x vulgaris).
 My confusion lies in the large number of suckers, normally a giveaway for the latter. I‚Äôll have to return to confirm either way and if the seed leaves have jagged tips I‚Äôll know their true identity.
 Under the lime trees bluebells have given way to dog‚Äôs-mercury and primroses, which are at their peak. A lone wild service tree grows like a rod of iron at the woodland edge. One thing of note is the solid wooden benches that line the trail and add to the welcome. A nice touch. This is a walk for people of all ages and abilities to enjoy.
 A green woodpecker yaffles. Rosemary and I exchange a glance as we know what this means and smile. A greater spotted woodpecker flies through the trees and disappears around the back of an old oak. Small birds are all around chirruping and obviously pairing up.
 We leave the woodland behind to be presented with a splendid stand of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) that sits in open country. What a handsome sight it is. A pair of buzzards and a red kite soar above. The path takes us eastwards past more old oaks, some of them forming glorious shapes against the nearly clear sky.
 We pass a rather large pond that my leaflet tells me is occupied by bogbean (Menyanthes trifoliata). We‚Äôll look out for its white five-petalled flowers on summer‚Äôs approach.
 As we near the end of our walk and return to our starting point, the real fun starts. I feel tiny in comparison to some of the trees here in the Old Arboretum. Coastal redwood (Sequoia sempervirens), a member of the cypress family from western North America, tower above us. The trees here are comparatively young but back home they can live for more than 1,500 years, one of the oldest living species on our planet, and grow to heights in excess of 370ft.
 Giant redwood (Sequoiadendron giganteum) from California rise above my insignificant frame. Some in the wild are known to be at least 3,200 years old and over 300ft tall. I feel like an ant by comparison.
 California nutmeg (Torreya californica) has the scent that its name suggests. Incense cedar (Calocedrus decurrens), another native of California, is also tall with a trunk that nearly always splits into two and is so elegant.
 Sweet gum (Liquidambar styraciflua), a relative of witch hazel, will display a startling colour of leaves come autumn.
 Two more natives of western North America are Western yellow-pine (Pinus ponderosa), which can shoot to well over 200ft, and Brewer‚Äôs weeping spruce (Picea breweriana), which is a slow grower with lovely pendulous foliage and rare both here and back home. Campbell‚Äôs magnolia (Magnolia campbellii), a native of the Himalayas, is bursting into flower.
 What an absolute delight our day has been. It will be a regular fixture from now on, especially as we‚Äôve only explored a portion and there is so much more to see.

That means your property must cost enough to qualify. So we took that out. We advocated for equity language on the ballot.
