Officials at the Williamsburg golf club announced it has “officially transitioned to a private club.” Members and their guests will enjoy the club located less than two miles northeast of the intersection of U.S. 31 North and M-72.
 “It’s exciting news, it really is,” said LochenHeath General Manager Kevin O’Brien. “We’re ecstatic about the decision, the ownership group is. It was always the plan to turn private and the time has come.”
 “We have always had the vision of LochenHeath becoming a private experience,” LochenVest Board Chairman Brent Maitland said in a release.
 “With the investment from our owner group, strong leadership and service team, our commitment to maintaining world-class course conditions, and growing interest in the club membership, we feel now is the time to transition to a fully private experience,” added Maitland, whose family cherry farm was used to construct the course.
 LochenHeath offers three levels of membership. It offers both resident and national memberships.
 O’Brien said there is a financial benefit for signing up for membership before the end of the year.
 Since the decision was made to transition on Oct. 15, O’Brien said seven new members have signed up. Six of those said their reason for joining was being a part of private club.
 LochenHeath wants to add 28 new members from Oct. 15 through the end of 2021, and another 30 in 2022.
 “Then we’ll evaluate how many new members we want to bring in. That’s both resident and national members,” he said.
 National membership dues will be less than those for residents because they’ll play the course less often. National membership is possible because of the construction of two cottages on the property.
 The cottages, which opened Aug. 1, 2019, are four-bedroom, 4½-bathroom units with 2,400-square-feet of living space. O’Brien said one or two additional cottages are scheduled for construction at the close of the 2021 golf season.
 The restaurant at LochenHeath will go private along with the course. A limited number of dining memberships are available.
 O’Brien said other on-course adjustments are planned for 2021 and beyond.
 “What changes does that mean?” O’Brien said. “There are a few.”
 For one, O’Brien said “the already pristine course will get better with less play.” He said there were 7,400 to 7,500 rounds played at LochenHeath in 2020, a figure that will drop with the transition to private.
 A three-year bunker renovation program will begin in the spring and one or two additional forward tees — five of which were added over the last several years — will continue in 2021.

Measuring success in three different domains
 A growing body of research supports the idea that failure can make you better off in the long run. Indeed, in another recent study, Wang himself found that an early career setback often set up scientists for later success.
 However, as the stories of Ford, Edison, and Rowling plainly demonstrate, the road to success typically involves more than a single setback. "You don't just fail once," Wang said. "You fail over and over." And while that litany of failures may make the Edisons of the world better off, it seems to thwart many other people.
 To understand why, Wang and his colleagues needed a lot of information about the process of falling, getting back up, and trying again.
 They turned to three massive data sets, each containing information about very distinct types of failure and success: 776,721 grant applications submitted to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) between 1985 and 2015; the National Venture Capital Association's database of all 58,111 startups to receive venture-capital funding from 1970 to 2016; and the Global Terrorism Database, which includes 170,350 attacks between 1970 and 2016.

Conservative Cllr Annie Brewster, chair of the district’s community, environment and sport scrutiny committee, has accused the Lib Dem administration of failing to consult on plans to remove the traditional blue and yellow market stalls and replace them with a variety of gazebos.
 She said: “The proposal to dispose of our traditional market stalls seems to have been advanced without adequate debate or attention.
 “The committee felt this is a very major issue affecting the future look of our city centre and it needs to re-thought and consulted on more widely. We must hear the views of traders, shoppers, local businesses and the public at large.
 “Members felt it was important to ensure that, once the pandemic is over, our 1553 Charter Market is uniquely branded again in St Albans’ colours. It needs to revert to a tidy, uniform appearance to project the right image of our city, as a major jewel in our crown.
 “There was a concern that dispensing with stalls to save the council money would open the door to re-development of the storage depot in Drovers Way where the market equipment is stored, removing this valuable resource.
 “While Covid has hit the council’s finances and we always have to be cost efficient, the committee was of the view that the Charter Market is the beating heart of the city and must be properly resourced.”

Milano, 9 dic. (Adnkronos Salute) - Quattro anni, sintomi come la tosse già dal 21 novembre, nessun precedente di viaggio segnalato. Sono le caratteristiche di quello che si configurerebbe come il nuovo paziente 1 d'Italia, secondo lo studio dell'università Statale di Milano pubblicato sulla rivista 'Emerging Infectious Diseases'. Mattia, il 38enne primo caso di Covid-19 sul suolo tricolore, diagnosticato a Codogno il 20 febbraio 2020, arriva - secondo la ricostruzione degli scienziati del Laboratorio di sorveglianza sul morbillo dell'ateneo meneghino - circa 3 mesi dopo. Gli autori dello studio descrivono il caso nel dettaglio. Il piccolo, nel cui campione raccolto tramite tampone è stato ritrovato l'Rna del coronavirus Sars-Cov-2, "vive nei dintorni di Milano. Il 21 novembre mostra tosse e rinite, circa una settimana dopo, 30 novembre, viene portato al pronto soccorso con sintomi respiratori e vomito. L'1 dicembre sviluppa un'eruzione cutanea simile al morbillo; il 5 dicembre (14 giorni dopo la comparsa dei sintomi), viene sottoposto a tampone orofaringeo per la diagnosi clinica di sospetto morbillo", ricostruiscono i ricercatori. Negativo. "Il decorso clinico di questo paziente, che includeva manifestazioni cutanee tardive, assomiglia a quanto riportato da altri autori. Le lesioni maculopapulari sono state tra le manifestazioni cutanee più prevalenti osservate durante la pandemia Covid-19 e diversi studi hanno notato un esordio successivo nei pazienti più giovani", sottolineano gli studiosi dell'ateneo meneghino. L'analisi sul campione del bimbo ha mostrato il 100% di identicità alla sequenza di riferimento Wuhan-Hu-1, nonché a sequenze di altri ceppi di Sars- CoV-2 circolanti in tutto il mondo in una fase successiva. Pertanto, chiariscono gli autori dello studio, "non è stato possibile determinare con precisione l'origine del ceppo identificato". I campioni analizzati nell'ambito dello studio sono stati raccolti tra settembre 2019 e febbraio 2020 da 39 pazienti (di età da 8 mesi a 73 anni, per una media 19,9 anni). Uno solo è risultato positivo a Sars-CoV-2 nell'esame 'a posteriori' condotto dai ricercatori su test che, nella circostanza in cui sono stati eseguiti, erano negativi al morbillo.

Those letters, called the "Social Security Statement," started going out once a year to all Americans over age 25 sometime in the 1980s. That statement primarily provided two important pieces of information. It gave you an up-to- date list of all the earnings posted to your record. And it gave you an estimate of your future Social Security benefits.
 You were supposed to check that earnings statement to make sure all your earnings were properly posted. Why? Because your potential Social Security benefits are based on those earnings. And if you saw an error, you were instructed to contact the SSA to correct the problem.
 And, of course, you were to use the data about your future Social Security benefits to make plans for your retirement.
 I remember at the time thinking that these statements were one of the best services the SSA had ever come up with. But at some point, we did some kind of survey of statement recipients. And guess what we learned? Most people were simply throwing them away!
 As you might guess, producing those statements and mailing them to almost every American was really quite expensive. And given the fact that many people just ignored them, especially younger people, SSA officials decided to save the taxpayers some money and change their policy on mailing Social Security statements. They are now sent out to all Americans over age 25 once every five years. But when you turn 60, they are sent to you annually, until you file for Social Security benefits. Also, you can request a statement anytime you want by going to www.socialsecurity.gov.
 One final side note about letters and the Social Security Administration. And this time, I'm talking about the reverse of what this column has been about.
 Are you thinking of sending a letter to the SSA to complain about something? Or to ask about something? Well, don't. Those letters almost always get lost in the bureaucratic maze. Why? Because the SSA's service provider network isn't based on responding to letters. It is based on one-on-one personal service, either at your local Social Security office (once it reopens post- COVID-19), or at their toll-free hotline: (800) 772-1213. Or even more efficiently at www.socialsecurity.gov. So, don't write the SSA a letter. Get in touch with them in person or online.

Video footage showing the lead homicide detective offering a man in police custody $500 for Burrell's name, even if it was just hearsay.
 -- Burrell's co-defendants saying the teenager wasn't at the scene that day. And one of them, Isaiah Tyson, said he, not Burrell, was the actual triggerman.
 The investigation's findings sparked national outrage and gave Burrell's family and community organizers the ammunition needed to get Klobuchar's attention. She said the case deserved a fresh look and called for the creation of the state's conviction review unit -- which received federal funding two months ago -- to examine other questionable cases. Protecting the innocent was just as important as punishing the guilty, she said.
 Laura Nirider, co-director of the Center on Wrongful Convictions at Northwestern University, and Barry Scheck, co-founder of the national Innocence Project, served as advisors to the panel, which included a former state attorney general, a former federal prosecutor, a member of the country's first conviction integrity unit, and the past president of the national Innocence Network.
 Several Minnesota organizations, including the state's chapters of the NAACP and American Civil Liberties Union, also supported the panel's efforts.
 The report acknowledged the devastating impact that Tyesha's death had on her family and the community, and said most of her surviving relatives chose not to comment about his recommended release from prison. One family member explained that the issue was "super touchy."
 But Tyesha's biological father, Jimmie Edwards, said he hoped Burrell, who has already served 18 years, would remain behind bars.
 "If you do the crime, you do the time," he was quoted as telling the panel. "The guy is a thug, and his whole family is thugs ... he should have had his ass in school. I hope and pray they will not release him."
 Throughout the report, the panel pointed to troubling examples of "tunnel vision," a term used when authorities build a narrative early in an investigation and zero-in on evidence that supports their theory of guilt while ignoring or suppressing anything that goes against it.
 "It's very common, especially when it comes to high-profile cases," said Richard Rivera, a former New York police officer who exposed wrongdoing in his own force. "When something does get in our head, and pieces start to fall in place, then we have a tendency to either pursue those pieces or kind of make the square pegs fit in round holes sometimes."
 Though not speaking specifically about Burrell's case, he said such a closed- minded mentality by investigators can shape the criminal proceedings as a whole, from prosecutions to plea deals.
 Burrell's name was first brought to police two hours after the shooting. They got a jailhouse call from a well-known confidential informant, Isaac Hodge, who said the intended target of the shooting -- a low-ranking member of Hodge's gang -- had implicated the teen. Panel members note that these jail calls to the eyewitness and police should have been recorded, but there is no indication they were, which was another key failing.
 When Burrell was arrested and interrogated four days later, he told detectives he was at Cup Foods -- the same store George Floyd visited in May just before his death in police custody.
 Though Burrell told detectives to pull the store's surveillance footage, there's no evidence that ever happened, which the panel highlighted as another troubling example of tunnel vision. If Burrell was seen on the video, it could "only disconfirm" investigators' theory that he was the killer, the panel wrote.
 However, it was evident early on from jailhouse calls between Burrell and his mother that the teen believed the tapes had been recovered and that he would soon be going home. His mother -- who died in a car crash after visiting him in jail three weeks later -- reassured him, saying she had gone to Cup Foods with his sister and his girlfriend. She said the store owners told them the footage had already been handed over to the police.
 "I bet you they already know I'm innocent!" Burrell is heard telling his mother on the recorded call from jail. "They just don't know … they ain't found the right person. And they don't want to let me go until they find him."
 The panel review also raised serious questions about the inconsistent testimony from the sole eyewitness. He was 150 feet (46 meters) away from the shooter, who was partially concealed behind a wall. And they were skeptical about the stories collected by six jailhouse informants, all of whom also had ties to Hodge, the man who gave police their first tip.
 All of the informants stood to benefit by cooperating with authorities and some were considered "serial informants" who provided police information on several cases. One, who said his 16-year sentence was cut to three years, recently told the AP he was lying when he implicated Burrell. Another said he agreed to work with detectives on 14 other cases.
 According to the panel, police and prosecutors often turn to "snitches" when they don't have enough evidence to close a case. Once authorities are married to a theory, it can be difficult to evaluate the reliability of their own informants, sometimes called "falling in love with your rat." Other cases involving the same informants used to secure Burrell's conviction also should be considered for review, the panel wrote.
 The panel also was concerned that other jailhouse calls and four witnesses with no vested interest were ignored, even though they had information that could have helped exonerate Burrell. One of the most credible was the getaway driver's girlfriend, who called 911 and pointed to Isaiah Tyson, the self- confessed shooter.
 She later told detectives she had been assured Burrell was not at the scene.
 Two other eye witnesses also identified Tyson as the shooter, the panel noted, but police appear to have ignored their accounts and never ran ballistics or gunshot residue tests on his jacket.
 Burrell's case has also raised questions about the handling of other criminal investigations, particularly some involving young Black men and women.
 "This is not an isolated incident, and we need to free the countless other men and women who have been wrongfully convicted," said Leslie Redmond, the former president of the Minneapolis NAACP and founder of Don't Complain, Activate. She said what happened to Burrell was "a shame and should be a crime."
 Freeman released a statement last month maintaining that Burrell was the triggerman. However, he said he would be willing to cut 15 years off Burrell's prison time, which would make him eligible for release when he's 46, because the current sentence "is too long of a penalty for someone who was convicted as a teenager."
 That angered many community members.
 "He's being vindictive," said Mel Reeves, of The Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder, the state's oldest continuously operated Black newspaper. "Because the evidence doesn't support that. He's made serious statements about Myon Burrell which border on slander."

While the mass of organisms has continued to shrink over the last 120 years, humans have dramatically ramped up material production, making it the key driver of the shift in balance between human-made materials and nature.
 At the start of the 20th century, human-produced objects were equal to just 3% of global biomass.
 But explosive growth has continued almost unabated since World War II. Today, the authors estimate that human-made mass is being produced at a rate of roughly 30,000,000,000 tons (30 gigatons) per year.
 This means that on average, materials outweighing the body weight of every person on the planet are being produced each week.
 If this pace continues, human-made mass -- including waste -- is expected to exceed 3 teratons by 2040, tripling the weight of all living things.
 Given the challenges of accounting for such huge global stocks of human-made mass and biomass -- and how you define the two -- the authors acknowledge there is uncertainty about exactly when we will reach the crossover point.
 It is possible that the point of transition already occurred in the past decade, and if not, it will occur in the next 20 years, the study says.
 And though the scientists say the finding is symbolic, they say this milepost does provides humanity with a chance to take stock of how we got here -- and what the future looks like.
 "The study provides a symbolic and mass-based quantitative characterization of the Anthropocene -- the geological age of 'the era of humanity,'" two of the study's authors, Emily Elhacham and Ron Milo, said in response to questions via email. "Given the empirical evidence on the accumulated mass of human artifacts, we can no longer deny our central role in the natural world. We are already a major player and with that comes a shared responsibility."
 Fridolin Krausmann, a professor at the University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences in Vienna who has studied interactions between nature and society but was not involved with this study, said the researchers' findings show how large society has become compared to the natural world.
 And though he said the findings were not particularly surprising, he does hope they send a strong message to people, and bring more attention to how modern societies can grow sustainably.
 "It's the two highly problematic trends, that the study relates here, that are important: The comparatively slow, but long-term, continuous human-induced reduction of the global biomass stock vis-à-vis the exponentially growing anthropogenic (human-made) mass," Krausmann said by email. "Better knowledge about the dynamics and patterns of anthropogenic mass, and how it is linked to service provision and resource flows is key for sustainable development. The big question is how much anthropogenic mass do we need for a good life."

Hardik Pandya has been India's star performer both on and off the field in Australia. The all-rounder who played as a batsman in the limited-overs series against Australia not only emerged as one of the bankable batsmen in the middle-order but also showed signs of a matured teamman by handing over his T20 Man of the Series to newcomer T Natarajan.
 Reacting on the same, former Indian batsman VVS Laxman said it was an 'excellent' gesture by Pandya and added that there is no doubt Natarajan will continue to work hard in the future.
 "Excellent gesture from @hardikpandya7 Great to see him exhibiting qualities of a leader. Also feel very happy for @Natarajan_91. I have no doubt Nattu will continue to work hard and show improvement and progress in his craft. Good luck," Laxman tweeted.


   
   
 Natarajan made his ODI and T20I debut in this Australia tour and impressed one and all with his ability to adapt to different situations. Natarajan emerged as captain Virat Kohli's go-to man in the absence of experienced seamers Jaspirt Bumrah and Mohammed Shami.
 "I want people to believe in themselves and to achieve anything even if odds are against them. It's just my way of appreciating his hard work over the years. For me, Natrajan deserves the Man of the Series award. To perform so brilliantly on his debut speaks volumes of his belief and the talent he possesses," Pandya said.
 While Natarajan picked just two wickets in the ODIs, he finished with six wickets in the three-match T20I series - the most. In fact, it was the manner in which he kept bowling the yorkers that impressed one and all with the pacer being compared to someone like Zaheer Khan.
 Pandya had earlier spoken about how the pacer deserved the Man of the Match award after the second T20I as well.
 "I thought Natarajan would have been Man of the Match. The other bowlers struggled and he really had a good game, he gave us a target about 10 runs lower than it would have been," he had said.
 Skipper Virat Kohli had said that the pacer can be an asset for the team. In fact, Kohli is known to be fond of left-arm pacers due to the angle they create.
 "Natarajan special mention for him as in absence of Bumrah and Shami. He is been the guy who has stood up and really delivered under pressure. And it's an outstanding fact that he playing his first game at the international level," Kohli had said during a virtual press conference on Tuesday
 "He looks very composed and is a very hard-working guy and very humble too. I wish him all the best and a left-arm bowler is always an asset on the field and if he can be consistent it will be a great thing for us heading into the world cup next year," he had added.

The researchers tested this model with their data, using average time between attempts as a proxy for an individual's learning ability (since better learners will start from scratch on fewer components, allowing them to produce new iterations quickly).
 What they found was a surprising relationship between learning and eventual victory. It's not the case that each additional unit of learning boosted one's odds of success equally. Rather, there's a singular learning threshold that separates eventual successes from the rest.
 Wang compares this threshold to the transition between water and ice. "Imagine I go from -5 to -4 degrees Celsius," he explained. "Nothing happens. The ice stays as ice." But the moment the temperature hits a particular point, it begins to melt.
 Similarly, if someone's learning ability is below the threshold, it's as if they were learning nothing at all. They may improve slightly over time, Wang says, but they will never retain enough good components to produce a full- throated success.

Packing snow also was the only ingredient needed to build an igloo.
 Each of us would scoop up a handful of snow, pack it into a snowball, push it down into the snow and begin rolling it along the ground. If the snow consistency was correct, the ball would grow as it rolled. We would guide our individual creations toward a central location, then wrestle them toward each other until they touched.
 The process was repeated until we had an almost-complete circle about six feet in diameter. Then we’d make more big snowballs in progressively smaller sizes, stacking them layer atop layer, curving the walls inward. Eventually, an igloo-like shape would appear. We always were careful to form the classic entry tunnel we’d seen in pictures of real igloos.
 Setting the snow capstone to seal the center of the roof was a three-person job, our big brother outside to lay a sheet of crusty snow over the hole and my sister and I inside to try and prevent collapse. If we could find a suitable piece of ice on a nearby pond, we’d use that instead to create a skylight.
 Our masterpiece of architecture complete, we’d stand back to admire the lumpy, misshapen heap of snow and congratulate ourselves on the successful completion of a major building project. Then all three of us would crawl inside and look at each other for perhaps a minute. Then my sister, coming to her senses, would retire to enjoy the intelligent alternative of dry clothes, a blanket and a mug of hot cocoa. My brother would last awhile longer before he also would abandon the cold Michigan winter.
 Frequently I would end up alone huddled inside the igloo, thinking about my wild, wild life. I vaguely recall watching my frosty breath linger in front of my face, then studying the many imperfections of the interior snow masonry. Then I’d realize my arms and legs were frozen and begin thinking about logical alternatives to squatting alone in a dark cave of snow. I’d tough it out inside the igloo until I ran out of things to think about, then I, too, would stumble back into the house.
 Each subsequent day after school, I’d crawl back inside for a moment of quiet reflection, sometimes joined by a sibling or two. But the visits grew less exciting until the igloo just huddled out there, abandoned and forgotten in the midwinter darkness.
 Our igloos typically survived a week or two before succumbing to a thaw. They faded away without a tear from any of us.
 Like everyone else, I am more than ready for the coronavirus to fade away. This been a cold, dark, introspective year. Many Americans have shed tears for lost loved ones during this pandemic.
 My home is much warmer than those igloos of my childhood. It’s brighter and roomier and has WiFi. But I’m anxious for the pandemic to melt away. I want to crawl out of my house and enjoy the world.

To make a long story short, it took 6 years to finish the car (did it all myself!) and it became the car I wanted, white with blue stripes, a 306ci small block with 2-four barrel carbs, a T-5 and it's low, loud and fun. I drove it maybe 3000 miles over 10 years so to say it was a garage queen is an understatement. Then I got a job in Oregon, packed my belongings and my beloved car into a trailer and headed out of California. Here the weather is beautiful during the summer and I don't have a gravel driveway or have to park in a gravel lot at work, so I started actually driving the car to work once in a while. In the meantime, my little boy grew up to a 6'+ teenager and one day the inevitable happened. He had his permit and came to me and told me he'd like learn to drive a manual trans and maybe someday if it was OK, he's like to learn to drive and since the only manual trans vehicle we owned was my pride and joy...you can see where this was going. Now I need to tell you, this car has only had 2 owners since 1968, the 93 year old lady I bought it from and me. Since 2001, I have been the only one to drive it. I Paid for it, I did all the work, it's MY car. But it's also MY son, he watched this car come together from day one. So I grabbed the keys and we went to learn to drive a stick. I drove to the bottom of our one-lane road since old cars feel a little "wandery" to people who'd never driven them. Once we got to the bottom, I got traded places with him and gave him the wheel. He let the clutch out the first time and killed it. Some guy sitting on the steps of a local store giggled, my son got embarrassed, but started the car and tried again. This time, the car lurched a couple times, then like magic, we were driving! I was never so proud to give my son an experience in my life! He remarked on the loose feel of the steering and the manual discs were a little different than what he'd felt in my wife's Fusion, but we both knew this was a special day. We stopped in a church parking lot down the road a few miles and I let him practice the whole clutch thing again. With the newer pavement, he barked the tires a couple times, got a dirty look from some old biddy who apparently thought a couple idiots in a loud Mustang were violating her place of worship. That day the Mustang went from "mine" to "ours". He started taking real pride in the car and someday will own it, but that day was huge for both of us.

La ministra italiana è stata inserita nella prestigiosa lista per "quanto fatto a Torino quando era Assessore e per le più recenti iniziative come 'Sperimentazione Italia', la norma che consente a startup, università, centri di ricerca e pmi di accedere ad una procedura semplificata per la sperimentazione di progetti innovativi", si legge nella motivazione. "Sebbene gli impatti del Covid-19 siano stati devastanti per le persone di tutto il mondo" la pandemia "ha anche dimostrato che i 'servitori pubblici' possono essere agili" e "che è possibile lavorare in modi nuovi" ha commentato la co-fondatrice di Apolitical Lisa Witter e ex co-presidente del Wef Agile Governance G Witterlobal Future Council. "Ci auguriamo che questa lista, evidenziando esempi eccezionali di agilità nel governo, serva come ispirazione per rendere questi modi innovativi di lavorare una 'nuova normalità'" ha aggiunto Witter. Apolitical è la rete di apprendimento globale utilizzata dai pubblici dipendenti in oltre 170 paesi. L'Agile Governance Global Future Council del Wef riunisce i principali esperti del mondo del business e del governo per guidare una riforma normativa che scateni l'innovazione e stimoli la crescita economica.

 TORONTO/OTTAWA, Dec 9 (Reuters) - Canada on Wednesday approved its first COVID-19 vaccine, clearing the way for doses of the Pfizer Inc and BioNTech SE shots to be delivered and administered across the country.
 Canada is the third country after the United Kingdom and Bahrain to give the green light to the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.
 Canada has a temporary accelerated drug review system very similar to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's emergency use authorizations.
 "The approval of the vaccine is supported by evidence that it is safe, effective and of good quality," regulator Health Canada said in a statement. It has initially been authorized for use in people 16 years of age or older.
 The news comes a day before a panel of advisers to the FDA is set to review and recommend whether the U.S. agency should authorize use of the Pfizer vaccine, and a day after UK citizens become the first in the world to get the shots outside of clinical trials.
 Canada will receive an early shipment of up to 249,000 doses of Pfizer's vaccine this year. The province of Saskatchewan said on Wednesday it expected to receive enough doses for 1,950 people by Tuesday to inoculate healthcare workers in direct contact with COVID-19 patients.
 "Today's decision from Health Canada is a historic moment in our collective fight against the COVID-19 pandemic and is a major step towards returning to normalcy in Canada," said Cole Pinnow, president of Pfizer Canada, in a statement.
 The UK, on Dec. 2, was first to approve the two-dose Pfizer vaccine, which in a large clinical trial was 95% effective at preventing illness.
 Pfizer is responsible for shipping its vaccine, which requires ultra-cold storage, to warehouses across Canada.
 Canada has a firm order for 20 million doses of the vaccine, enough to inoculate 10 million people, with options to buy up to 56 million more.
 For the most part, provincial and territorial health systems will administer the shot, for free, across the country. They will have final say over how to use scarce early supplies in their jurisdictions.
 According to preliminary guidance published by the federal government in early November, vulnerable people and those who look after them are high priority, including long-term care residents and some healthcare workers.
 Regulators have received rolling applications for three other experimental vaccines, from Moderna Inc, AstraZeneca Plc and Johnson &amp; Johnson.
 Of those, the Moderna vaccine is farthest along, having completed pivotal trials showing it to be 94.1% effective at preventing illness and 100% at preventing severe COVID-19.
 Officials have said they expect to receive six million doses of Pfizer and Moderna vaccines before the end of March 2021. Each vaccine requires two doses given about three weeks apart.

Roma, 9 dic. (Labitalia) - "Sono bastate meno di 24 ore per superare l'obiettivo minimo di raccolta. È davvero un segnale di grande fiducia". Così Marco Rizzelli, General Manager di Seed Money, il primo acceleratore privato italiano ad aver completato un round di equity crowdfunding nel 2018, commenta i risultati della campagna. Oltre 180 soci di cui più di 50 investitori seriali con all'attivo oltre 10 investimenti ciascuno e che compongono il nocciolo duro del club deal di Seed. Un portafoglio di 15 startup tra accelerate e partecipate, attentamente selezionate che può vantare un tasso di rivalutazione a 12 mesi pari all'80%. Una formula vincente, collaudata nel tempo, che ha permesso alle startup accelerate di poter raggiungere, nelle rispettive campagne di raccolta in equity crowdfunding, tassi di successo dell'87% con un overfunding medio del +267%. Tra i casi recenti, Locare, Birrificio 620 Passi, RepUP, LegalEye, solo per citarne alcune.
 "Le startup hanno bisogno non solo di risorse finanziarie, ma anche di apprendere come fare impresa. A volte il problema è più la mancanza di una cultura imprenditoriale che di risorse finanziarie e spesso genialità e velocità di execution, si scontrano con scarsa organizzazione e assenza di controllo di gestione. Noi operiamo proprio cercando di colmare questo gap e i risultati raggiunti sono la prova che la direzione è giusta", spiega Rizzelli.
 I business angel di Seed Money, oltre ad essere spinti da un obiettivo finanziario, devono anche saper apportare valore alle startup. Per questo il modello operativo di Seed Money si fonda su tre pilastri che nel corso degli anni hanno generato risultati tangibili: un'attività di mentoring portata avanti da un team di business angel soci, provenienti dal mondo dell'impresa e delle professioni, impegnati nel seguire le startup accelerate apportando non solo fondi ma anche competenze e relazioni; una grande attenzione ai numeri e a un corretto controllo della gestione operativa; l'uso del crowdfunding come strumento di approvvigionamento finanziario per le startup in fase early stage.
 "Raccogliere fondi attraverso l'equity crowdfunding equivale, secondo noi, un po' a una piccola quotazione. L'ingresso di molti soci, infatti, educa i founder a una maggiore attenzione e responsabilità nei confronti degli stessi e al tempo stesso permette di preservare una certa autonomia di azione fondamentale nelle fasi iniziali di vita di una startup", sottolinea Rizzelli.
 Nel radar di Seed Money sono passati progetti particolarmente significativi come CleanBnB, la startup degli affitti brevi, quotata su Borsa Italiana nel 2019, che è stata incubata e accelerata in Seed prima della costituzione societaria. Oggi Seed Money è pronta ad accelerare la propria crescita e lo fa attraverso una nuova campagna di equity crowdfunding che permetterà di investire su nuove startup ampliando ulteriormente il proprio portafoglio. Si tratta per tutti di un'occasione importante per poter investire in startup e innovazione, attraverso una realtà di eccellenza senza doversi accollare il rischio legato agli investimenti in startup innovative.
 Aderendo alla campagna di Seed Money, tutti possono entrare a far parte di un club che sa fare scouting, sa guidare le giovani aziende e sa negoziare condizioni di favore per sé e per i propri soci durante gli aumenti di capitale delle startup accelerate. "Oltre a partecipare ai successi del veicolo di investimento, tutti i soci saranno coinvolti dal team nelle fasi di selezione e accelerazione e potranno anche interagire direttamente con le startup. Un modo di lavorare unico in Italia che permetterà agli investitori non solo di approfondire il business model della specifica iniziativa, ma anche di valutare forme dirette di collaborazione", conclude Rizzelli.

The topics of automation and artificial intelligence came into play. How could these technologies play a role in potential airline crash situations? Some thoughts were shared as to how AI might play a role in airlines. In the short term, it can and is being used to help the pilots and crew do their jobs. By 2030, it could enable flights with only one pilot on board and by 2035, maybe a pilotless flight. For sure this will be looked at for cargo flights initially.

They addressed key urgent issues, including protection of civilians, quality of the response, relocations and returns, and the need for greater synergy among all actors and stakeholders. The delegation visited camps and host communities where IDPs and community members emphasized the need for further food and general assistance. Women IDPs also underlined the need to reinforce protection assistance for women and girls. Meeting with governors in the three states, the Humanitarian Coordinator stressed on the imperative of maintaining joint efforts in preventing the propagation of COVID-19 across most fragile communities and the need to ensure greater protection for aid workers in light of increasing insecurity. In Borno State, the Humanitarian Coordinator also discussed the sensitive issue of resettlement and relocation, insisting on the need for greater engagement from the authorities with the aid community and the respect of agreed-on mechanisms to ensure safe and dignified returns.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Retiring Rep. Joe Kennedy III used his farewell speech from Congress on Wednesday to deride the “great lie of our times” that the government lacks the resources and will to help people in need. He said the real problem is greed, not scarcity.
 Speaking for five minutes on the House floor, Kennedy, D-Mass., called his four terms in Congress an honor and said he was departing “proud and hopeful.”
 But the only remaining member in Congress of the vaunted Kennedy political dynasty also said the U.S. was “a complicated and messy country.” He said it had “violated our founding promises before the ink was dry,” citing slavery and rights that initially applied largely to “rich, white and Protestant men."
 Kennedy, 40, said the country was gradually making progress, saying, “Our arc isn’t clean, but it is clear."
 But without mentioning names or political parties, he called that progress “the counterweight to the great lie of our times: that the American pie is finite. That for my family to survive, yours must suffer. That the richest nation on Earth is somehow plagued by scarcity – rather than greed."
 He added, “Loosening that lie’s grip on our country is the work of our generation. For the people who feel unseen, unheard and unpresented. For those most in need of assistance and protection, justice and opportunity, who have been told by their government that there is just no room or money or time or will. And that injustice is a reality etched in stone, rather than a deliberate choice by those in power, about who is worthy and who is not."

The Atlanta Police Department is investigating a double shooting that occurred during an attempted carjacking in Buckhead.
 According to a preliminary report, Dec. 8 at about 12:10 p.m., officers responded to a 911 call about two individuals being shot outside the Peachtree Cleaners and Laundry at 1891 Peachtree Road in Buckhead.
 When they got there, officers found two males, later identified as James Pope, 45, and Tanner Pope, 22, who each were shot in the shoulder while stopping a man from stealing a car. Both were alert, conscious and breathing and transported to a local hospital for treatment.
 According to the preliminary report, Michael Stuckey parked his 2016 black Volvo SUV in the dry cleaner’s parking lot and left it running while inside. When he returned to his car, he saw a male suspect sitting in the driver’s seat.
 “The suspect attempted to drive off, and that is when Mr. Stuckey opened the driver-side door of his vehicle and began to tussle with the suspect,” the report stated. “Two good Samaritans attempted to assist Mr. Stuckey with preventing the suspect from leaving the parking lot with his vehicle. While doing so, a second suspect pulled up in a silver Volkswagen Jetta and shot at the victims, striking (both) in their shoulders. The vehicle owner, Mr. Stuckey was uninjured.”
 The first suspect then got into the Jetta with the second suspect and they sped off. Police later found the Jetta abandoned on Collier Road, and later determined it had been reported stolen in Smyrna.
 Anyone with information on the suspects’ identity is asked to call 911 or contact Crime Stoppers Atlanta. Information on the case can be submitted anonymously to its tip line at 404-577-8477 or online at www.stopcrimeatl.com. Callers do not have to give their name or any identifying information to be eligible for the reward of up to $2,000 for the arrest and indictment of the suspects.

SALISBURY, Mass. — A West Boylston man caught in an undercover state police fireworks sting over the summer not only saw the hundreds of dollars he spent go up in smoke but was fined $100, according to Newburyport District Court records.
 Jeffrey A. Perry, 36, of Worcester Street, was summonsed to court in July on an unlawful possession of fireworks charge back in July. Last Thursday in court, Perry saw the charge dismissed but was ordered by Judge Peter Doyle to pay $100 in court costs.
 Trooper John Ragosa was one of several state police officers conducting "fireworks enforcement" around 5 p.m. on July 8, in Salisbury, just before the state line. On the other side of the New Hampshire border, several undercover troopers were keeping an eye on fireworks retailers.
 Around 5 p.m. undercover troopers spotted two people leaving Phantom Fireworks in Seabrook and load a bag and a box into the trunk of a gold 2000 Buick LeSabre.
 "I stopped that vehicle on Route 95 (south) in Salisbury," Ragosa wrote in his report.
 After confirming that Perry was a Massachusetts resident, Ragosa found a slew of fireworks in the trunk. The trooper then told Perry, who admitted to buying the fireworks in New Hampshire, that he would be summonsed to court.
 Among the fireworks found in the trunk were a Komodo 3000 Fountain, 24 fully loaded shells, Echo In The Air 6-5 shells and Wolfpack Firecrackers. Added together the list price for the fireworks were well over $400.
 "All items were seized and later handed over to the bomb squad," Ragosa wrote in his report.

Santas have decided that magical feeling is worth the risk. But they have to take the right precautions. First, there's the issue of masks - a challenge when you a long beard.
 "You don't really look like Santa" in a mask, says Arnold. Many Santas have opted for face shields instead, which allow children to see their expressions.
 Then there's social distancing, often facilitated by child-impermeable barrier. It's important that kids can't climb around it, or run up to Santa, and not just for their health.
 "If a child were to, in a burst of enthusiasm, try to run up to me and give me a hug, it would be incumbent upon me to physically reject that child, which Santa cannot do," says Erwin.
 So set designers are getting creative. One of Arnold's in-person appearances this year will have him at the top of a very tall sleigh. Children will pose six feet below him for their photos. In another, he'll sit inside an inflatable bubble with air filtration.
 He actually thinks he'll be healthier this year. "Most of us catch a cold or bronchitis or something every year," Arnold says. "Not being exposed to three or four or five or six or seven hundred children a day is going to go a long way."
 Bass Pro Shops, which hosts an elaborate Santa's Wonderland each year, has forged ahead with its tradition, with one important addition: They call it "Santa's Magic Shield." It's a plexiglass divider that is invisible in photos, so it looks like Santa is sitting with the kids. "When we took stock of everything, we were hearing about what families have had to endure this year," says company spokesman Jack Wlezien. "We really challenged ourselves to say, is there a way we can do this safely and responsibly?"
 So, this year, the store is making Santa visits appointment-only and requiring social distancing in line. After every child's turn, a crew of elves comes in with sanitizer and disinfectant to wipe down the magic shield.
 The setup might prompt some tough questions from the kids. How do elves do social distancing? Can Santa still visit us if we are quarantined? Can Santa catch covid-19? Can Santa give me covid-19? Is Santa a superspreader?
 Connaghan, the Toys for Tots Santa, has a ready answer. The magic of Christmas is what makes reindeer fly, and how Santa squeezes down the chimney of every child in the world with his bottomless sack full of presents. And in 2020, it conveys other privileges. Epidemiological ones.
 "The way I can get around the world in one night to all the homes and all the children - well, that magic extends a little bit to where it'll be safe for me to go into all those homes," he says. "It's safe for you. But only for that one night."

A person evaluates the components of their past tries based on feedback from others (for the people in Wang's analysis, feedback might come from the NIH, venture capitalists, or higher-ups in a terrorist organization).
 But the model acknowledges that some people learn from their failed attempts more than others, with those who "learn more" incorporating more components of their failed attempts into their later attempts.
 At one extreme, the very worst learners incorporate zero information from their previous tries, starting from scratch on every component every time. At the other extreme are perfect learners, who consider all of their past failures with each fresh attempt. Most people are somewhere between these two extremes.
 While perfect learners will likely achieve success quickly, the model predicts, the worst learners have a low chance of success -- since they never learn anything, they simply "thrash around for new versions," Wang said, wasting valuable time going back to the drawing board again and again.

Harvey’s only complaint was the timing of the news. She had hoped TCAPS would have announced the news Monday after Whitmer’s press conference.
 Amanda Malinao felt the same way.
 Malinao, a mother of three TCAPS students — one each at the elementary, middle and high school levels — said too many families were left wondering whether or not they needed to coordinate childcare or working from home.
 “Something should have been in place right away so that TCAPS would already have plan A if she extends it and plan B is she doesn’t extend it,” she said. “As soon as she said something either way, they should have a response for the parents.”
 Malinao is “conflicted” about her daughter returning to East Middle School on Wednesday.
 Although she believes face-to-face education is vital for children, Malinao said the same reasons the high schools are shut down apply to the middle schools.
 “They go classroom to classroom to classroom, and they’re all in the hallways at the same time,” she said. “If they’re shutting down the high schools because they’re constantly by each other, junior high is constantly by each other, too.”
 High school students could return in person for just two days — Dec. 21 and 22 — before the holiday break, but it is possible instruction will stay remote. VanWagoner said board trustees are likely to make that decision at the Dec. 14 meeting.

 "It's nice to see that there is not only one or two guys that maybe will take over tennis in a few years but there is more than a handful or even more than 10 guys that have the possibility and level to become champions," he said.
 "Few of them play very differently to one another and there is good variety coming in the next few years."

_The Nutcracker_ ballet, famously choreographed by Marius Petipa and Lev Ivanov to the music of Tchaikovsky, was an instant success when it first premiered in St. Petersburg on December 18, 1892. And perhaps because of the enchanting music, or the Christmas tree that magically grows to be larger than life, or maybe because of the dancing sweets that twirl deliciously on their toes, the tradition has remained alive. But after well over a century of seasonal performances, ballet dancers and audiences, like much of the world, find themselves facing an unprecedented disruption of tradition. With theaters closed around the country since March, COVID-19 has made live performances of _The Nutcracker_ a risky endeavor. But that doesn’t mean that dance companies around the country will let this season pass sugarplum-less (for their sake, as much as ours).

Airborne Command Posts were first nicknamed doomsday planes by the United States, as they are designed for use in the event of nuclear war or a major disaster that would see ground-based command infrastructure destroyed.
 The most famous models of such specialized aircraft are the US Boeing E-4B, based on the Boeing 747, and the Russian Ilyushin-80, based on the passenger Il-86. According to Tass, the country's armed forces currently have four Il-80s in service.
 Russia's "doomsday" planes can take off from any civil or military airfield, according to state news agency RIA Novosti. Each has a powerful engine, modern communication facilities and a life support system that enables it to remain airborne for several days.
 Aside from the cockpit windshield, the plane does not have any windows, so those onboard are not blinded by a nuclear explosion, RIA Novosti said. The tail section houses an outlet cable antenna for communication with submarines.
 While specifics of the equipment on board the aircraft are not known, it is believed to have everything necessary to control the armed forces, while also accommodating high-ranking passengers with areas for both work and relaxation.
 Back in October, Tass reported that the planes were set to be upgraded.
 An aircraft industry source told Tass the updated version would be based on an Il-96-400M quadjet, long-haul, wide-body airliner.
 The source said the new version would "significantly increase the period of airborne combat duty and to extend the radius for troop command."

This note provides a set of recommendations, with a view to strengthening strategic and policy collaboration across the three institutions in fragile and conflict prevention situations (including FCV countries, but also partner countries facing difficult political challenges and transitions at all levels of income and capacity). These recommendations are not meant as a panacea: sustaining peace is first and foremost a question of national ownership and political will, with the UN and the IFIs playing a supportive role to national reformers. Moreover, a complex landscape of global actors beyond the UN and the IFIs, including foreign investors, bilateral partners, and regional organizations, increasingly play a critical role in peacebuilding. But strategic complementarity between the UN, World Bank, and IMF is vital not only to amplify the impacts of their respective interventions, but to provide a basis to help countries build the constituencies and alliances necessary to end violence and sustain peace.

Hardik Pandya has been India's star performer both on and off the field in Australia. The all-rounder who played as a batsman in the limited-overs series against Australia not only emerged as one of the bankable batsmen in the middle-order but also showed signs of a matured teamman by handing over his T20 Man of the Series to newcomer T Natarajan.Reacting on the same, former Indian batsman VVS Laxman said it was an 'excellent' gesture by Pandya and added that there is no doubt Natarajan will continue to work hard in the future."Excellent gesture from @hardikpandya7 Great to see him exhibiting qualities of a leader. Also feel very happy for @Natarajan_91. I have no doubt Nattu will continue to work hard and show improvement and progress in his craft. Good luck," Laxman tweeted. Excellent gesture from @hardikpandya7 Great to see him exhibiting qualities of a leader. Also feel very happy for @Natarajan_91 I have no doubt Nattu will continue to work hard and show improvement and progress in his craft. Good luck. pic.twitter.com/aqvfrMR3xG&mdash; VVS Laxman (@VVSLaxman281) December 9, 2020 Natarajan made his ODI and T20I debut in this Australia tour and impressed one and all with his ability to adapt to different situations. Natarajan emerged as captain Virat Kohli's go-to man in the absence of experienced seamers Jaspirt Bumrah and Mohammed Shami."I want people to believe in themselves and to achieve anything even if odds are against them. It's just my way of appreciating his hard work over the years. For me, Natrajan deserves the Man of the Series award. To perform so brilliantly on his debut speaks volumes of his belief and the talent he possesses," Pandya said.While Natarajan picked just two wickets in the ODIs, he finished with six wickets in the three-match T20I series - the most. In fact, it was the manner in which he kept bowling the yorkers that impressed one and all with the pacer being compared to someone like Zaheer Khan.Pandya had earlier spoken about how the pacer deserved the Man of the Match award after the second T20I as well."I thought Natarajan would have been Man of the Match. The other bowlers struggled and he really had a good game, he gave us a target about 10 runs lower than it would have been," he had said.Skipper Virat Kohli had said that the pacer can be an asset for the team. In fact, Kohli is known to be fond of left-arm pacers due to the angle they create."Natarajan special mention for him as in absence of Bumrah and Shami. He is been the guy who has stood up and really delivered under pressure. And it's an outstanding fact that he playing his first game at the international level," Kohli had said during a virtual press conference on Tuesday"He looks very composed and is a very hard-working guy and very humble too. I wish him all the best and a left-arm bowler is always an asset on the field and if he can be consistent it will be a great thing for us heading into the world cup next year," he had added.

Milano, 9 dic. (Adnkronos Salute) - Quattro anni, sintomi come la tosse già dal 21 novembre, nessun precedente di viaggio segnalato. Sono le caratteristiche di quello che si configurerebbe come il nuovo paziente 1 d'Italia, secondo lo studio dell'università Statale di Milano pubblicato sulla rivista 'Emerging Infectious Diseases'. Mattia, il 38enne primo caso di Covid-19 sul suolo tricolore, diagnosticato a Codogno il 20 febbraio 2020, arriva - secondo la ricostruzione degli scienziati del Laboratorio di sorveglianza sul morbillo dell'ateneo meneghino - circa 3 mesi dopo.
 Gli autori dello studio descrivono il caso nel dettaglio. Il piccolo, nel cui campione raccolto tramite tampone è stato ritrovato l'Rna del coronavirus Sars-Cov-2, "vive nei dintorni di Milano. Il 21 novembre mostra tosse e rinite, circa una settimana dopo, 30 novembre, viene portato al pronto soccorso con sintomi respiratori e vomito. L'1 dicembre sviluppa un'eruzione cutanea simile al morbillo; il 5 dicembre (14 giorni dopo la comparsa dei sintomi), viene sottoposto a tampone orofaringeo per la diagnosi clinica di sospetto morbillo", ricostruiscono i ricercatori. Negativo.
 "Il decorso clinico di questo paziente, che includeva manifestazioni cutanee tardive, assomiglia a quanto riportato da altri autori. Le lesioni maculopapulari sono state tra le manifestazioni cutanee più prevalenti osservate durante la pandemia Covid-19 e diversi studi hanno notato un esordio successivo nei pazienti più giovani", sottolineano gli studiosi dell'ateneo meneghino.
 L'analisi sul campione del bimbo ha mostrato il 100% di identicità alla sequenza di riferimento Wuhan-Hu-1, nonché a sequenze di altri ceppi di Sars- CoV-2 circolanti in tutto il mondo in una fase successiva. Pertanto, chiariscono gli autori dello studio, "non è stato possibile determinare con precisione l'origine del ceppo identificato".
 I campioni analizzati nell'ambito dello studio sono stati raccolti tra settembre 2019 e febbraio 2020 da 39 pazienti (di età da 8 mesi a 73 anni, per una media 19,9 anni). Uno solo è risultato positivo a Sars-CoV-2 nell'esame 'a posteriori' condotto dai ricercatori su test che, nella circostanza in cui sono stati eseguiti, erano negativi al morbillo.

BALTIMORE) -- The Baltimore Ravens faced off against the Dallas Cowboys Tuesday night without their wide receiver Dez Bryant, who tweeted he would not be taking the field after testing positive for COVID-19 just minutes before kickoff.      Bryant said he was warming up with the team on the field -- with a mask on -- when he was pulled off by team officials for further testing.      Fox Sports reported an earlier COVID-19 test came back inconclusive and had to be retested.      Bryant reacted angrily on social media, as the former long-time Cowboys player had been looking forward to facing his former team. He tweeted he had the same routine and the positive test made no sense to him, before saying he was going to call it quits for the rest of the season.      The Ravens went on to beat the Cowboys without Bryant, 34-17.      Two weeks ago, Baltimore experienced a coronavirus outbreak among players and staff. Twenty-three players and staff were put on the COVID-19 list, including reigning MVP quarterback Lamar Jackson.      The team had to postpone its Thanksgiving Day against the Pittsburgh Steelers three times. It also prompted this week's game to be pushed back to Tuesday.

Roma, 9 dic. (Adnkronos) - C'è anche la ministra italiana Paola Pisano nella lista delle 50 persone più influenti che hanno rivoluzionato il modo di governare di un Paese rendendolo più agile. La lista è stata stilata e diffusa oggi dal network Apolitical e dall'Agile Governance Global Future Council del World Economic Forum. La titolare dell'Innovazione tecnologica e della digitalizzazione si è conquistata un posto nella lista che vuole celebrare "quei politici, funzionari pubblici e imprenditori che sostengono una governance agile nei governi del mondo" e vuole dare un riconoscimento "sia alle icone di alto profilo" che "fare luce sugli eroi non celebrati il ​​cui lavoro è indispensabile per trasformare il modo di governare al servizio di tutti i cittadini in questi questi tempi difficili".
 Pisano è nella lista accanto, tra gli altri, al ministro dell'Economia degli Emirati Arabi Uniti, Abdulla bin Touq, al ministro dell'Istruzione e Direttore responsabile dell'innovazione della Sierra Leone, David Moinina Sengeh. La ministra italiana è stata inserita nella prestigiosa lista per "quanto fatto a Torino quando era Assessore e per le più recenti iniziative come 'Sperimentazione Italia', la norma che consente a startup, università, centri di ricerca e pmi di accedere ad una procedura semplificata per la sperimentazione di progetti innovativi", si legge nella motivazione.
 "Sebbene gli impatti del Covid-19 siano stati devastanti per le persone di tutto il mondo" la pandemia "ha anche dimostrato che i 'servitori pubblici' possono essere agili" e "che è possibile lavorare in modi nuovi" ha commentato la co-fondatrice di Apolitical Lisa Witter e ex co-presidente del Wef Agile Governance G Witterlobal Future Council. "Ci auguriamo che questa lista, evidenziando esempi eccezionali di agilità nel governo, serva come ispirazione per rendere questi modi innovativi di lavorare una 'nuova normalità'" ha aggiunto Witter. Apolitical è la rete di apprendimento globale utilizzata dai pubblici dipendenti in oltre 170 paesi. L'Agile Governance Global Future Council del Wef riunisce i principali esperti del mondo del business e del governo per guidare una riforma normativa che scateni l'innovazione e stimoli la crescita economica.

Shantz noted that in total, there were 46 call outs for Monday, out of 458 teachers and staff, adding that number "was no greater than the district has experienced in past occasions in the regular course of delivering instruction."
 "Data on staff 'call-outs' was not publicized in the letter, but was known in advance by you. Yet, you chose to communicate at the last possible moment to the community that the basis for the suspension of hybrid and in-person teaching was 'functional closure,'" Shantz wrote
 "By emphasizing a 'functional closure' as the basis for your communication, you have fueled emotional and unsubstantiated responses, on multiple social media platforms. Allegations that the district was 'forced' by a presumed 'organized effort' by the teachers to coordinate a 'sick out' were insinuated. Such allegations are unequivocally and patently FALSE — as you likely know — but the premise of your letter enflamed the passions of the community, in a manner that you did nothing to refute or dispel," he wrote.
 "The backlash from the community in response to your decision was subsequently deflected, and targeted at the teachers, with unsubstantiated and inaccurate claims of an organized effort among PGEA members," he wrote.
 "We wish to emphasize in the clearest and strongest terms that the PGEA leadership would never prompt its membership — explicitly or implicitly — to engage in legally prohibited actions that would violate an existing contract or state labor law," Shantz wrote.
 Shirk, Shantz wrote, would have been justified in citing an increase in COVID-19 cases for postponing the return to class. As of 10:30 p.m. Monday, the district's COVID dashboard shows 10 cases of students testing positive for the virus, and two staff members.
