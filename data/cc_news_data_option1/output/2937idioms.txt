Almost every actress in Hollywood wanted to play Scarlett O’Hara in David O Selznick’s much-heralded production of Gone with the Wind. Olivia de Havilland, very shrewdly, aimed at Melanie; Joan, who had been considered for Melanie but wanted only Scarlett, recommended her sister, not without malice, for the less interesting role. Jack L Warner, who had consistently rejected Olivia’s pleas for better parts, was unwilling to let her go until she appealed to his wife.

De Havilland was among the last of the top screen performers from the studio era, and the last surviving lead from "Gone With the Wind," an irony, she once noted, since the fragile, self-sacrificing Wilkes was the only major character to die in the film. The 1939 epic, based on Margaret Mitchell's best-selling Civil War novel and winner of 10 Academy Awards, is often ranked as Hollywood's box office champion (adjusting for inflation), although it is now widely condemned for its glorified portrait of slavery and antebellum life.

A capable actress, well-mannered and softly spoken, she had a gentle beauty which lit up roles that might otherwise have seemed cloyingly sweet or merely uninteresting, such as Maid Marian in The Adventures of Robin Hood (1938) and Melanie in Gone with the Wind (1939). Excellent performances in The Snake Pit (1948) and The Heiress (1949) showed that she possessed a wider range, and in a famous clash with the studio she exhibited a steely firmness: but she was always most fondly remembered as the softening feminine element in swashbuckling adventure stories. A highly publicised tiff with her sister, Joan Fontaine, spluttered throughout their lives.

LAKE PALMDALE: Continued good catfish action on stink baits fished in sponge rigs, dough baits, or cut baits. The weeds are getting pretty thick, so flying the baits has been the best bet so the bait settles on the top layer of the weeds where the catfish can root it out. Top spots have been the north side of the Blacktop or Pier One -- the deep water parts of the lake -- but the fish are showing all around the lake now, cruising the weed beds. The largemouth bass are fair to good and showing early and late in the day all around lake and at all the docks and aggressively chasing baitfish. Spinnerbaits and chatter baits with the skirts doused with scent and nightcrawlers or plastics have been the best baits fishing over the tops of the weeds. The bluegill bite is fair to good off any of the docks on fly-lined nightcrawlers with a lot of hand-sized and bigger fish. The trout bite is surprising still decent with some good catches again this week.

DESTIN - Eddie Mansfield was sitting in church when the name came to him for his second women's clothing boutique in the Destin area, Kiss the Sky.
   
 A name was something he prayed about after driving by his ideal location at the Plantation Commons numerous times on his way to Destin Fitness. He also wanted something more catchy than Favori Boutique, the boutique he opened six years ago at The Market Shops in Miramar Beach. The name is based off of the French word for favorite.
   
 "I felt like the Lord sent me that Kiss the Sky name, so it must be the green light to go ahead,'" Mansfield said. "I called them up, we got in talks and I chose the space and I started decorating it."
   
 Mansfield made the space pretty and nice, he said - only to close its doors. He opened in February, just a month before the government mandated shutdown.
   
 Now, he wants the community to know it's reopened.
   
 "I sell artwork, gifts, soaps, some perfumes, clothes - primarily women's apparel," Mansfield said. "It's got a bohemian look. I like things that are a little bit more on the edgy, beachy side. (The brand) Johnny Was on the higher end and Z supply, which is on the younger, inexpensive end, and everything in between."
   
 The shop also offers jewelry, soy candles and women's shoes.
   
 Mansfield loves hand selecting items for the shop. He, his girlfriend and one of their employees have fun going to markets in Atlanta and other cities to search for merchandise, he said.
   
 And, running a boutique is in his blood. His family is also behind the Boca Boutique & Galleries in the area.
   
 "My mom was in the boutique business," Mansfield said. "She had her own stores, from the time I was 5 until recently. It seemed like a good business, something I liked doing - going to market, decorating, finding clothes and jewelry. Even though I'm a man, I kind of enjoyed it."
   
 Decorating the shop was fun, too.
   
 "It's got a shabby chic look - really white and uplifting, very coastal," Mansfield said. "We have a lot of coastal artwork. My dad's an artist. He's painted several pieces of new, modern art in there and I've bought a good bit of art from Atlanta."
   
 Mansfield has lived in the area since 2005. He moved to be closer to his parents and has worked at Path of Grace Women's Recovery Homes for 10 years - currently as the managing director. He loves Destin, he said.
   
 "I've always loved the beaches," Mansfield said. "I've been coming here for years and I love the atmosphere in Destin - the relaxed, peaceful community that's here. It's nice to be in the slower paced living where you don't have to dress up much, more casual. My stores are more casual. They're not really business-y, more going out to dinner, relaxed, beach style clothes."

“It is important (to get the contracts sorted). But at the end of the day I can’t sign the contracts," he said after the defeat to Brighton.

 “I do that obviously, not just me, our scouts and staff - we have regular meetings on what we think is appropriate and important.
 “I know the guidelines of the club, the financial framework, but we are in a very healthy state financially.
 “At some point these decisions will get made, I can only guide and give the answers to the situations I think are important."
 Dyche has been linked with a move away from Turf Moor in recent weeks with speculation continuing to suggest Crystal Palace will target him.
 But the Burnley boss has always distanced himself from those rumours and said he was happy at Burnley if the framework is right.
 He said: "I think every manager is ambitious. We’ve been ambitious within the framework we’re given here.
 "Ambition is a strange situation - here it is making the best of everything we can and that’s a big challenge.
 “We try and rinse every drop out of every situation. It’s tough at times but enjoyable. My staff and the players buy into that. I believe in the development of what we do.

Gurugram Over the past week, Gurugram has witnessed a discernible rise in the number of active cases -- for the first time since flattening early this month. From 1,029 cases on July 19, Gurugram's tally of active patients grew by 10 percent, touching 1133 cases on July 25. With Sunday's 170 recoveries outweighing the day's 121 new positives, however, Gurugram's recovery rate has ensured that the district has just 1,084 active cases.District health department data going back three weeks show that Gurugram's daily recovery and growth rates have been neck and neck, a trend which officials cited as favourable. While active cases grew by 10 percent over the past week, the total tally of patients who recovered from Covid-19 grew by 12 percent, from 6,603 patients discharged on July 19 to 7,408 on July 26.Health department officials also pointed out that the share of active cases to Gurugram's total caseload has remained stable. "In early July, active cases were about a quarter of total infections. This came down to about 13 percent in mid-July, and is still around 13 percent only," said Dr Jai Prakash Sharma, Integrated Disease Surveillance Program's district surveillance officer in Gurugram.Officials also said that the uptick in active cases, until Saturday, was comprised largely of asymptomatic patients who have been put under home isolation. "While growth of active cases can put more pressure on the healthcare system, we are getting mostly mild cases who are capable of recovering at home. Enforcing home isolation strictly has been central to our response and its success," said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, Gurugram.Yadav added that the district's recovery rate on May 31 was just 36.7 percent. "When we began focusing on home isolation as a strategic intervention, the recovery rate rose to 64 percent at the end of June, and is now close to 85 percent," he said. However, challenges in enforcement still persist. A doctor with the district health department, on the condition of anonymity, revealed that complaints about patients violating home isolation rules are frequently received. "In at least four cases, where the violations were very blatant, FIRs have also been filed and the persons booked under the Epidemic Diseases Act," the official said.District health department data, meanwhile also showed a slight increase in the number of hospitalised patients over the past week. From 98 who were hospitalised on July 19, there were 128 patients hospitalised across Gurugram till Saturday. It then fell to 116 cases the next day. "Not only is the recovery rate climbing, the percentage of positive cases that end up requiring tertiary care has remained stable, at between 9 and 10 percent, throughout July. We are in control of the situation," Sharma said.When asked whether it would be possible to slow the district's current daily average growth rate -- about 1.7 percent at present -- even further, deputy commissioner Amit Khatri said, "That will depend on community participation as much as our interventions. In theory, yes, we could perform even better at containing the virus, reducing active cases, increasing the doubling rate and so on. But there are challenges to on ground interventions which mathematical models don't capture. Our approach is to respond to the situation as it arises, and if cases surge we will take necessary steps."

Although Robin Hood, in particular, was hugely popular, even she failed to appreciate its classic quality until she saw it again, long afterwards, and declared herself “enchanted by its gaiety and charm”.

 Kudlow told Tapper that "we have had a flood of inquiries and phone calls and complaints that small stores and businesses and restaurants can't hire people back."
 "They went too far," he continued. "Maybe last March, it was necessary for that, but really the consequences of people not returning to work ... we want to pay folks to go back to work."
 The enhancement was designed to keep laid-off people at home instead of out looking for work during the pandemic-fueled lockdowns and has helped millions pay the rent, buy groceries and cover other bills. But it has also kept some workers on the sidelines -- creating headaches for employers trying to get back up and running, even as new coronavirus surges complicate state reopenings.
 Lawmakers on Capitol Hill have been divided about whether to extend the federal boost, with Democrats saying it should be extended into next year because the economy is still weak and the unemployed say they are having trouble finding positions, as well as childcare.
 Republicans, however, are concerned that such generous payments may deter people from going back to their jobs, which would slow the economic recovery.
 And even as Republicans are gearing up to release their coronavirus stimulus bill, Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham had a stark prediction for an upcoming vote on such legislation.
 "Half the Republicans are going to vote no to any Phase 4 package, that's just a fact," Graham said in an interview on Fox News' "Sunday Morning Futures," though he noted, "I think we will come together before August the 5th to get this done."
 White House chief of staff Mark Meadows said on ABC's "This Week" that "the original benefits will not" be in the new bill, adding that "the original unemployment benefits actually paid people to stay home."
 The chief of staff also confirmed he and Mnuchin are returning to Capitol Hill on Sunday to continue going over details of the bill.
 Meadows said the proposal will involve offering enhanced unemployment benefits that would replace a laid-off worker's wages up to 70%, although he acknowledged challenges some states will face in administering such a complicated benefit. He said he has worked with Mnuchin and Labor Secretary Eugene Scalia to ensure "antiquated computers" in some state benefit offices don't stop people from receiving their benefits.
