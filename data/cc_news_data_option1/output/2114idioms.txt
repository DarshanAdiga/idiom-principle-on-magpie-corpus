We decided if we can't beat them, we'd join them and had a date night ... well, we got a take-out meal, sat at the kitchen counter (instead of the couch) and I put on lipstick and a clean top with my leggings.

PLYMOUTH - Plymouth North Baseball Head Coach Dwayne Follette and this week's 50-for-50 profile Joe Flynn have something in common.
 Flynn always wanted the baseball in the most important games. And when those games came up on the schedule Follette always wanted the baseball in the hands of the big right-handed pitcher.
 "Joey's the best pitcher I've ever seen throw the ball for Plymouth," Follette said. "I've been lucky to have some really good pitchers over the years but in my mind Joe is the best out of all of them. He threw the ball in the high 80's but he had this amazing pinpoint control. He could put the baseball anywhere he wanted to around the plate and he had several pitches that he had the confidence to throw at any time in the count.
 "Joe was a very good athlete but the thing that really set him apart from the pack was his competitive nature. He is such a great gentleman off of the field, but when he got between the baselines he was an intense competitor."
 "I'm still that way," admitted Flynn, 29, who is a firefighter in town. "The competition aspect of the game is the thing that I always loved about playing sports and it's also what I miss the most now that I'm not playing any longer.
 "The bigger the game, the more I liked it and nobody had more fun playing high school sports than I did," Flynn added. "Sports were a huge part of my day back then. A lot of my teammates were my best friends and I'm still close with so many of them to this day. We shared a lot of great times together."
 An outstanding relief appearance in a come-from-behind playoff win over Dighton-Rehoboth as a freshman was just a taste of what was to come for Flynn. He was 33-4 as a starter over his final three years with the Eagles, twice winning the Atlantic Coast League and Division 2 Player of the Year honors while leading Plymouth North to the Div. 2 state title game against Auburn at the end of his junior and senior years.
 He was also a solid defender at third base when not on the mound as well as a very good hitter, slugging six homers and driving in 28 teammates as a senior.
 "He was unbelievably consistent on the mound. Whenever I gave the baseball to Joe I was sure that we were going to win that game," Follette said. "He threw a couple of no-hitters and had a 9-1 record in playoff games in high school. I can only remember him having one bad start in all the time that he played for me."
 Flynn thought his team was meant for big things during his sophomore year in 2007 but the Blue Eagles were upset by Foxboro in extra innings in the second round of the Div. 2 playoffs.
 Plymouth North finally put it all together in 2008, running the table for a 26-0 record and a Div. 2 state championship when they beat Auburn 1-0 in 10 innings.
 They ended the season ranked seventh in the USA TODAY national high school baseball poll.
 "That year was magic," said Joe, who had four of his team's six wins during the tournament run and was an unblemished 12-0 over the entire season. "It was special. There were games where things could have gone off the rails but every time we needed it somebody different stepped up and made a play to keep the winning streak going."
 Wins were harder to come by in 2009 when the Eagles snuck into the playoffs with a record of 11-9. Despite being the 20th seed in the bracket they got hot at the exact right time and ran off five straight upset wins to get to a state title re-match with Auburn that they lost 2-1.
 "Auburn scored two unearned runs in the first inning and then Joe shut them down the rest of the game," Follette said. "Unfortunately we couldn't get anything going offensively against their pitcher."
 The next step up the baseball ladder for Flynn was time with the Franklin Pierce baseball program and two summers playing in the Cape Cod Baseball League as a member of the Wareham Gatemen where he was a teammate of Boston Red Sox reliever Matt Barnes, Houston Astros All-Star outfielder George Springer and Los Angeles Dodgers infielder Max Muncey.
 "It was a big jump from high school baseball to Franklin Pierce, which is one of the top NCAA Division II programs in the entire country," Joe said. "You were competing against some top baseball talent every game and your training had to be year-round to keep up with everyone else. You had to give it a full commitment or you were going to fall by the wayside."
 Franklin Pierce made it to the NCAA tournament all five of the years Flynn pitched with the Ravens, including two trips to the Div. II national playoff finals.
 Flynn was off to a great start to his junior year (4-0 with a 1.40 earned run average) and was getting some draft buzz from MLB teams before things came to a screeching halt. Discomfort in his pitching elbow led to season-ending Tommy John Surgery.
 "I remember just not feeling right and Matt (Franklin Pierce starting catcher and former Plymouth North teammate Matt Walsh) noticed that my pitches were a little off," Flynn remembered. "I decided to get it looked at and that's when we found some pretty significant damage in the elbow that had to be taken care of."
 Flynn made it back to the mound by the end of the 2013 season and picked up five saves in 10 innings of relief action. He closed out his senior season back again as a starter with a record of 5-3.
 With all his baseball accomplishments at Plymouth North you might forget that Flynn was also a very good football player. A two-way starter at quarterback and safety, Flynn led the Blue Eagles to a winning record in both his junior and senior years.
 "There was no better adrenaline rush than walking down that hill at the old Romano Stadium to get to the football field," Flynn said. "It had that 'Friday Night Lights' feel to it with the big crowds cheering the team on. I loved playing football and it was tough giving it up to concentrate on baseball in college."
 Former Blue Eagle Head Football Coach Bill Burkhead praised Flynn for both his athleticism as well as his competitive nature.
 "Joe had a passion for the game. He was a gifted athlete who could run with the football and he had a cannon for an arm," said Burkhead. "We were traditionally a running football team but we switched things up when Joe came around. He was a talented passer and he had a couple good targets in Keegan Grabhorn and Tom MacInnes."
 Flynn still lives in town with his wife, Noelle. He was inducted into the Plymouth Athletic Hall of Fame in 2015.
 Each week during 2020, the 50-for-50 project will profile a Plymouth person or state championship team that positively impacted the town in the last 50 years. To nominate someone, email Sports Editor David Wolcott Jr. at dwolcott@wickedlocal.com with information on the nominee.

Ohio Department of Health director Dr. Amy Acton signed two new orders on Friday, one extending the closures of most indoor and outdoor entertainment and recreation facilities until 11:59 p.m. on July 1.


   


  That extends by a month the closures of auditoriums, stadiums, arenas, concert or music halls, parades, fairs, festivals, carnivals, amusement and theme parks, water parks, aquariums, zoos, museums, arcades, children's play centers and playgrounds.


   


  Acton also signed an order removing a restriction on sales of spiritous liquor to out-of-state residents that had been imposed April 13 in certain Ohio counties to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The measure mostly applied in eastern Ohio where residents of Pennsylvania were crossing into Ohio to buy alcohol because state liquor stores in that state were closed at the time.


   


  The first order involving entertainment and recreation facilities did not sit well with at least one state representative. Jon Cross, a Republican from Kenton whose 83rd district includes all or parts of Hardin, Logan and Hancock counties reacted angrily on his Facebook live page broadcast Friday night.


   


  Cross complained his district has had only one death while unemployment rates are 15% or higher in his counties. He called for Acton's removal.


   


  The new orders extending certain Coronavirus cases continued to increase Saturday in Ohio, though some figures released by the Ohio Department of Health did not have include the latest data because several lab results were not received in time due to technical difficulties.


   


  The state reported 32,639 confirmed cases and 2,395 probable COVID-19 cases on Satirday for a total of 35,034 cases statewide. That's up 468 cases from the 34,566 reported on Friday.


   


  COVID-19 deaths in Ohio rose 18 from a total 2,131 Friday to a total 2,149 on Saturday, which includes 1,928 confirmed and 211 probable coronavirus deaths. Again, the state's Saturday figures do not include all labs reporting.


   


  Total reported hospitalizations on Saturday were 6,011, an increase of 64 over the 5,947 on Friday, state data shows. The Saturday figure includes 1,548 intensive care unit admissions


   


  The age range of COVID-19 victims is from less than 12 months old to 109, with the media age being 52. Males continue to have more cases than females, 52% to 47%. About 1% of reported cases did not list the sex.


   


  Franklin County continues to lead the state in the dubious categories of total cases (5,773 on Saturday, up 99 over Friday) and in total deaths (260, up four over Friday).


   


  Cuyahoga County, which includes Cleveland, eads the state in total hospitalizations (1,098, up a dozen from Friday) but is second in cases (4,369, up 51 from Friday) and third in deaths at 226. as of Saturday. Lucas County, which includes Toledo, is second in deaths at 242 (up two from Friday).


   


  Other central Ohio counties of note include Marion County, which is third in total cases at 2,226 as of Saturday due in large part to state prison cases; and Pickaway County at fifth in total cases at 2,050. However, both Marion and Pickaway counties had 80 or fewer hospitalizations and 37 or fewer deaths as of Saturday.

That, too, may be shy a few pages. There are sure to be more issues than there are solutions. This COVID thing is turning out to be the ultimate sports challenge.
 By this time next week a large swath of the northern part of the state will be in the green zone, the rest in yellow. But what exactly that means to high school sports remains a mystery.
 “We hope that in those areas in the green settings, that they would have the ability to return to some sort of activity at the school,” Byers said.
 He’s just not sure what that will mean, other than maintaining some sort of social distancing on the field and off. How that applies to blocking and tackling drills is anybody’s guess.
 How will athletes be able to train? How will coaches be able to prepare their teams? How can we possibly envision football being played at the high school level come Labor Day? Again, more questions than answers, and that might not change for a long time.
 The PIAA Board of Control expressed earlier this month that it wants to see athletes return to the field as soon as they can, even if that means those in certain parts of the state get a jump over others.
 Competitive advantage at this point appears to be a microscopic issue compared to gigantic concerns, such as how to play safely.
 “We can only control what we can control,” Byers said, “and right now unfortunately (a lot of) this is outside of our control.
 “I wish I had a better answer. (We like) to look at things in black and white, and there’s a whole lot of gray area in this.”
 We want to know how and when, but right now the shelves are empty in the answers aisle.
 “I feel that same frustration (as others),” Byers said. “We all like to know exactly what’s going on, (but) this is outside of everyone’s control.”

Courtney Whitmore may be new to her heroic role on _DC's Stargirl_ , but the star of The CW's latest DC Comics-inspired superhero television series, Brec Bassinger, is already thinking ahead to what the future holds for this new generation of justice -- including a possible Arrowverse crossover. And if Bassinger could choose what Arrowverse hero Courtney might team up with, Supergirl seems like a solid choice given the heroine's super names.


  Speaking with _TV Guide_, Bassinger said that Stargirl and Supergirl just go together, name-wise.


  "Just the names in general kind of lend them to needing to work together," Bassinger said.


  Generally speaking, an Arrowverse crossover may not totally be out of the question. During The CW's "Crisis on Infinite Earths" crossover event last season, it was established that _Stargirl_ exists on the new Earth-2 after the Multiverse was reformed. While the main Arrowverse heroes of Earth-Prime have no idea there's a new Multiverse, it's not impossible that they'll figure things out eventually -- something that would give _Stargirl_ time to get through its first season. Bassinger has previously said that she thinks Stargirl and Supergirl would, in fact, be a dynamic duo, when the time is right.


  "Last night I was watching a bunch of interviews of Melissa [Benoist], and she's just the best Supergirl," Bassinger said. "I bet Stargirl and Supergirl would be this dynamic duo. That would just be awesome. So yes, my hopes are high. I really, really hope for it. But as of now, nothing planned, but fingers crossed."


  She also previously revealed that there have been some early talks about Stargirl getting to appear on _The Flash_.


  "There have been talks of Stargirl getting to go on an episode of _Flash_ , and having a bigger storyline, but it didn't happen this season," she said. "But I think that would be the coolest thing. So much of my family has watched _Flash_ for years."


  Series creator Geoff Johns has also expressed the possibility of an Arrowverse crossover, though his focus is on _Stargirl_ simply being the best show possible before that happens.

  "The future is wide open in the DC multiverse, so anything can happen between film and TV," he said. "Who knows? Because that's what the multiverse is. Obviously, right now the main concern is making sure that this show is great, that these characters are great, that they have their own stories and they get the proper screen time and the proper episodes to develop on their own. So hopefully in the future we can do something fun, but the first season is all about making sure that _Stargirl_ is the best show it can possibly be."


  What do you think? Would you like to see a Stargirl/Supergirl team up? What Arrowverse show would you like to see _Stargirl_ crossover with? Let us know in the comments below.

Both high and low temperatures are not recommended for paint drying. High temperatures cause the first layer of paint to dry quicker than the lower ones and form a skin over a surface. Extremely hot temperatures will cause the paint to dry too quickly. This will develop bumps, blisters, cracks, or discoloration on a surface. Conversely, low temperatures affect the process of drying too. It's extremely important to not paint when the temperature is freezing because this will cause all the moisture contained in the paint to crystalize. Also, note that temperatures should be appropriate not only during painting but also when drying. So recommended temperatures for oil-based paint are 45°F (7°C) for at least 48 hours; some paints are formulated to dry at lower temperatures so pay attention to the instructions.

Prime rib cooked medium rare throughout to amplify takeout orders, perfect grill marks on a signature burger while enjoying an extended patio season, and a guaranteed hot meal in the middle of a classic Lake Huron winter storm. Chefs and restaurant owners in Kincardine are preparing new and improved offerings with the imminent arrival of natural gas being brought to the community by EPCOR.
 In the fast-paced food industry, chefs demand more than just taste. Quickness, control and reliability are big benefits of cooking with natural gas. Local eateries are drooling over the opportunities it is presenting.
 West Coast Catering owner and chef, Alexandre Lussier, opened up a small business with his partner Sandra Giles. Their Kincardine grab and go food store specializes in prepared meals, a daily gourmet take out menu and a custom catering business. They already have the infrastructure in place and are ready to shift to natural gas.
 "When we took over the building, we knew natural gas was coming, so we wanted to be ready to jump on it. All our equipment is ready to convert--just bring it to the building and we'll do the rest," Lussier said. "All chefs are versatile, no matter what their environment is. But this will make a difference. I'm here to provide food for the local economy, and I'm excited to start cooking with natural gas."
 Lussier says natural gas provides a cleaner flame, burns stronger and is less expensive to operate. He anticipates purchasing a new deep fryer, shawarma machine, and a commercial combi oven featuring set and forget technology that cooks food consistently until complete; cue the prime rib.
 The Tartan Tusk, tucked into one of the oldest houses in Kincardine, is looking forward to the cost savings natural gas brings to the table, leading to a longer lakeside season for the typically summer-focused gastro pub.
 "We are a small, independently-owned business. Every penny counts. The cost savings of natural gas over propane make the decision to switch an easy one. A reduction of overhead and carrying costs means I can employ more people, offer better value on our menu and allow our business to thrive and expand," said owner Braden Prasad.
 Prasad's restaurant currently has two ovens, a grill, deep fryer, and 10 stove top burners all fuelled by propane. He says the popular eatery needs a reliable, cost effective fuel to deliver its product and food is just the start. The pub's water heater, HVAC, and laundry all require an energy source. Natural gas allows more room in the budget for upgrades, including gas power heaters to extend the life of its patio season, and other equipment improvements.
 "Our burger is a great example. It is easily our most popular menu item. We start with fresh, house-made buns, not possible without our trusty ovens. Our beef comes from Formosa and we treat it very well. That means a light seasoning of the patty, perfect grill marks and just melted cheddar cheese. We can't produce this kind of food without our equipment running at peak performance," said Prasad.
 Chef Ricardo Roque oversees menus for Huron Stone, The Erie Belle and Bistecca. Conversations with the ownership group suggest they will be retrofitting to natural gas once the service comes to town.
 "Hands down, natural gas is the way to go. It is always there. Turn your dial and it lights up. I've been doing this for over 40 years, I have lots of experience on different heat sources, my experience is natural gas burns better and is easier on the equipment," he said.
 With major winter storms posing road closure risks for hours or even days at a time, propane delivery can be postponed and force restaurants to shut down from supply issues. With natural gas piped in, these establishments are guaranteed to run their equipment.
 "The best thing is reliability. That is huge. When storms come in, you don't want to close because people are trapped, and they need to eat. So, you can still do well if your business is open," said Roque.
 Having a large propane tank onsite also takes up valuable real estate. Removing a tank allows for opportunities to increase parking or patio space. Tanks also have a life span and need to be replaced, adding a capital cost and an interruption in service.
 "With a traditional propane tank, I can't stress enough the hassle of needing to constantly check tanks to see what level you are at. Imagine cooking in the middle of food service and suddenly, the stoves go off, the tank is empty and a delivery is not coming. You must shut down and lose business, Roque said. "Just like BBQing with family and friends over. The steaks are ready to go on and the propane goes out. Imagine that on commercial scale, it's not good experience to have."
 Business owners and homeowners in Kincardine, Inverhuron and Tiverton are encouraged to sign-up for now at epcor.com/southernbruce to get natural gas service in the fall of 2020. Residents of Huron Kinloss with property between Saratoga Road and Concession Road 10, west of Lake Range Drive, are also eligible to sign up now for service this year.

When the word came down in one of those end-of-the-week news dumps that UAH was whacking its men's hockey team, it hit especially hard.


  “Complete shock,” said Tony Guzzo, a Michigan native who played for the Chargers from 1993-97 and now lives in Huntsville. “It came out of nowhere. No one was expecting it.”


  Thankfully, an impromptu fundraising campaign that got a boost from NHL goalie and UAH alum Cam Talbot raised more than $1 million, bringing word Friday that the Chargers will return to the ice for at least one more season.


  UAH also eliminated its men’s and women’s tennis teams at the same time it announced hockey’s demise — all in the name of balancing a bottom line that has taken a huge hit during the coronavirus pandemic.


  Across the country, scores of lesser-known college teams have been eliminated in the past couple of months, from the baseball team at Bowling Green to the wrestling squad at Old Dominion.


  Each of these blows is devastating in its own right.


  But the UAH hockey program has meant so much to the sport's development across the South — and, by extension, in every place where ice is used primarily to keep the drinks cold.


  “I don't know if I really understood what they did to grow hockey in the South until I was removed from it a little bit,” said Talbot, the Calgary Flames goalie who played for the Chargers a decade ago. “Alabama-Huntsville has been instrumental in growing the growing the game of hockey down south. It would be a shame to take it away from them.”


  In 1988, I first wrote about this one-of-a-kind program, the only NCAA- sanctioned team south of the Mason-Dixon line. In just four short years, the Chargers had gone from a club squad offering no scholarships to a bona fide Division II team. I still have a souvenir puck on my bookshelf that proclaims Huntsville to be the “Hockey Capital of the South.”


  Not that they had a lot of competition in those days.


  “I didn't even know Alabama had a hockey team,” Guzzo said, remembering the recruiting pitch he got from the Chargers. “But it was an amazing opportunity. Obviously, growing up in Michigan, the winters are not very nice. When you can walk out of the (arena) in January and it's 60 degrees — and you get to play hockey — that's a pretty good situation.”


  He adored the city so much that it became home.


  Dozens of other hockey alumni put down roots as well.


  The Chargers would go on to win Division II national titles in both 1996 and '98, then moved up to the big time. They joined College Hockey America, earning bids to the NCAA Tournament in 2007 and 2010 (both times, they were eliminated by one-goal defeats in the regional semifinals, including a wrenching, double-overtime loss to Notre Dame).

Of course the Fitbit only went and died on me on route and while I know I covered the distance, I'd no proof. That cheesed me off way more than it should have. Pandemic power walking is a very serious business.

Debuting as an 18-year-old in 1960, Hammond played in North Adelaide’s premiership side in his initial season and was a triple premiership player for the Roosters across a 234-game SANFL career. He then coached Norwood to the 1975 and 1978 premierships – the first ending a 25-year drought for the club and the second flag triumph coming in the Redlegs’ centenary year. He later coached both SA and the Sydney Swans in the VFL, before a remarkable administrative career in which he was the inaugural chairman of the Adelaide Crows, overseeing the clubs’ only two AFL premierships, and then serving as an AFL Commissioner for a decade from 2001-11. He was inducted into the Australian Football Hall of Fame in 2015, after previously being inducted into the SANFL Hall of Fame and being awarded Life Membership of both the SANFL and the AFL.

To illustrate the extent of losing community value, I remember my late classmate who told me that his mother practically knelt down to plead with him to marry from his community in Anambra State. Mama’s reason was that her five older sons who lived overseas married foreign women and Mama found it very difficult to communicate with her daughters- in-law. She was almost losing her community rights because none of her daughters-in-law had come home to pay homage as expected in their community. Mama who was widowed early never carried her grandchildren; instead she saw only their photographs and managed to mumble words on telephone with them once in a while. Mama believed that if her daughters-in-law lived close by, they would understand the joy parents get when they behold their grandchildren especially during festive periods in the rural communities. Mama’s joy was almost fulfilled when her third son brought home from England a full black African Kenyan lady. Her spirit leapt for joy only to discover that she could not communicate with her as well. Meanwhile he came very near home at least an African lady.

Governor Mike DeWine and Columbus Mayor Andrew J. Ginther announced Saturday afternoon that the Ohio National Guard have been ordered into Downtown Columbus in an effort to help quell protests that have turned destructive.


   


  A citywide curfew has been implemented from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. until the violence has passed, according to Ginther.


   


  "This curfew is not intended to stifle peaceful protest, but protect from those who use to seek to use this moment … to destroy our city," he said.


   


  The governor also said the Ohio State Highway Patrol will help enforce Columbus law.


   


  DeWine stressed that a small number of people have been perpetrating the violence and vandalism that necessitated this action.


   


  "This violence must stop," he said. "I understand that people have pent-up rage. I understand that we are living in very uncertain times right now in this country. In these times of uncertainty and these times of division that we must call upon the better angels of our nature."


   


  "We do this today so that love and kindness and compassion and peace can triumph over hate and violence," DeWine said.


   


  The announcement was made around 5 p.m. Saturday, hours after around 10 a.m. when protesters had first gathered at the Ohio Statehouse.


   


  Columbus police will also be closing all Downtown streets to non-emergency traffic as of 6 p.m. Saturday.


   


  The Saturday morning protest began with a few hundred people and grew within an hour to more than 1,000, prompting a heavy police presence.


   


  Saturday marked the third straight day of protests, which began in earnest Thursday evening.


   


  Columbus Police Chief Thomas Quinlan said the protesters concerned about racism deserve to be heard, but they're being drowned out by the people breaking windows in buildings and pushing back against police.


   


  "Enough," he said.


   


  Protesters have been gathering in solidarity in response to the May 23 death of George Floyd, who died while in Minneapolis police custody. A former Minneapolis police officer has been arrested and charged with murder.


   


  The move to bring in the National Guard comes as Columbus police officers have been ordered to work 12-hour or longer shifts. Additional officers have been called in and vacations or scheduled days off canceled to bring more officers to the city.


   


  Quinlan said the city's response to the protests and demonstrations will cost "hundreds of thousands of dollars" in overtime. He said there have been about "a dozen" arrests that have been made ranging from riot to vandalism and other charges.


   


  Around 1:30 p.m. Saturday, the city issued an emergency declaration for Downtown and said everyone should avoid the area.


   


  This came in light of face-offs between protesters and police. About 2,000 people showed up for Saturday's protest. While most of the protesters, who were of every race and age, demonstrated peacefully, some pushed back on police trying to clear them from the streets.


   


  Police used pepper spray to disperse the crowd.


   


  "There's a contingent of people in the crowd, not the people seeking redress over discrimination and racism," Quinlan said. "People seeking to exploit this opportunity to violent protest and damage business - beyond repair in some cases."


   


  Quinlan and Ginther both said there is evidence and intelligence police have gathered that there are demonstrators within the group from outside the community and are increasing their presence within the protests, turning them violent.


   


  "Lives are on the line and its important that we bring an end to this," Quinlan said, urging another form of dialogue to focus on the issues of racism and discrimination.


   


  Quinlan said there was evidence that a firearms store was looted and multiple firearms were stolen.


   


  Saturday's protest followed a tense night between police and several hundred protesters.


   


  Most of the protesters were marching peacefully, with some shouting at police as they walked. Other groups were pushing back against police, throwing full plastic water bottles, rocks and fireworks at officers. Pepper spray and rubber and wooden projectiles were used by police to push back the protesters.


   


  Around 10 p.m. Friday, an emergency was declared and police told demonstrators they needed to leave the area. Groups of protesters then scattered, breaking windows of businesses Downtown and in the Short North for the second straight night. There were also those who spray-painted buildings and windows.

  This week's question  


  Destination Plymouth's executive director sees a dire picture for Plymouth and the county in terms of a significant loss of tourism dollars this year and in coming years. Unless, possibly, assistance in the form of promotion funding aid comes to bear. What do you think of local tourism as an economic engine, and what impact will the coronavirus pandemic situation have on it?


  Pat Adelmann


  Lea Filson, the executive director of Destination Plymouth, was doing a good job of promoting Plymouth as a tourist haven, before the Coronavirus pandemic. No doubt she will continue and succeed to bring tourists to Plymouth when all the restrictions are lifted. On a flight to Buffalo in January, I saw multiple life-size murals in the airports, enticing travelers to experience the many offerings in Plymouth.


  The rebound will be long and tough but Plymouth is too beautiful to miss. Tourists will be back. Perhaps some of the Cares Act's $90,000,000 awarded to the County can be dispersed to help Plymouth's tourism.


  Pat Adelmann has been a Plymouth resident since 1977 and is a mother of five Plymouth Public School graduates, a proud grandmother of 12, a former School Committee member and a former Town Meeting representative.

  The virus shutdown is and will continue to be a disaster for the tourist industry in Plymouth. People will be reluctant to travel, particularly people from overseas. Plimoth Plantation is, to some extent, an outdoor venue, but derives significant revenue from retail sales and school trips. School trips are gone. I think people will be reluctant to congregate in the retail shops at the Plantation. As pointed out by Lea Filson in the news paper, tourists are a great driver of the local economy in terms of hotels, restaurants, retail shops, etc. I can imagine that people will be reluctant to travel great distances. So, an economic disaster.

  A town or city should not base its income on tourism. If you are a business owner that caters to tourists you "may" be ok on a regular yearly basis. However, the economy follows cycles. It goes up, falls and corrects itself and then starts over. When something like this virus happens it only gets worse on the down side. If you are a regular working Joe you do not support your family on the pay that a tourist trap or retail will pay you.


  No promotional funding aid. If individual or groups of businesses want to pool their money and place their own advertising then that is fine. But any sort of aid or bailout only means that someone somewhere else has to pay for it. Or we can kick the can down the road, borrow lots of money and our grandchildren will have to pay for our greed. Which is currently what our state and federal governments are currently doing.


  We have an industrial park. Guess we should have allowed more industry in there instead of pretty office space.


  Open up the economy. Try to minimize the damage as much as possible. Make Massachusetts a free state again.

  Tourism is the largest resource that we have in Plymouth. It brings millions into the community. Be it the Arts, History, Dining, Retail Shops, Special Events, Recreation etc., we all benefit in some way or another. The loss of revenue has been immediate to restaurants, bars, historical facilities, concert and arts venues, retail shops, etc., not to mention those who have lost their livelihood. (My company, Nightlife Music Co. has not had a cent of income since February).


  The recovery will be equally challenging. With the loss of marketing and events dollars in 2021, we will need to resort to collaborative marketing with our Tourism partners, massive free Social Marketing, an uptick in generous sponsorships, etc. to speed our recovery. I hope that in the next recovery stimulus package, Tourism and supporting businesses, non-profits, workers in those industries and others will not be forgotten. Our non-profit, Project Arts of Plymouth, Inc. are planning our FREE Summer Concert Series to be larger than ever for 2021, because obviously, the key to our recovery is a resurgence of tourists and locals coming out to support us and all other businesses in Plymouth in 2021.

  Covid19 has knocked tourism to a complete standstill. The key question, of course, will be the pace of the rebound, the recovery. On that, I am optimistic, as there is a growing pent-up need to travel and get out from under house arrest. And those future tourists will be uneasy about getting on an airplane, so they will more likely be picking destinations to which they can drive with their families. Plymouth is a relatively easy drive from anywhere in the Northeast, including New York and New Jersey. I predict a regional rebound while we wait for the slower return of national and international visitors. And we are the Cape without the bridges: fine beaches of salt and fresh water, great restaurants, lively outdoor brew pubs, fishing and whale watching excursions, vast hiking and bicycling recreation, not to mention 400 years of history. Getting help for promotion and marketing would be a great accelerator, reminding our future visitors that we are close to home, we are open, and we are a great destination, year round.

  School principal Luke Zartman and speedway officials came up with a plan that worked within the state's social distancing guidelines to give these seniors an unforgettable moment.

  Kreuk also said that while she no longer feels an "intense" tie to _Smallville_ , she does think it's "neat" that the iconic Superman prequel series has been incorporated into The CW's slate of DC-inspired shows.


  "It's so fun to have _Smallville_ get incorporated into the current comic book shows," Kreuk said. "it feels like we're in a continuum, which is really neat."


  Kreuk also expressed excitement for the upcoming ___Superman& Lois_ series which will see Lana Lang have a significant role in the series. In _Superman& Lois_, Emmanuelle Chriqui will play Lana Lang-Cushing, a loan officer at Smallville Bank. Married to Smallville police chief, Kyle Cushing (Erik Valdez), Lana will re-establish her friendship with Clark Kent (Tyler Hoechlin) during what is described as a difficult time in her life. That series is expected to debut on The CW in January 2021 and while _Superman & Lois_' Lana will be different from _Smallville_ 's, Kreuk is excited just the same.


  "I imagine that Lana is a very different character in a different universe," she said. "I am excited to... hear about how the show portrays her. She's an interesting character in the canon, so having her be in a predominant role on this new show is awesome."

Indeed, population control of COVID-19 requires a collectivist mindset, consistent with the public health adage "a case anywhere is a risk everywhere," but this is easier said than done, especially in societies (including the U.S.) that are often characterized as individualistic; that is, geared toward self-protection rather than the common good. Mask-wearing has been characterized as a "culturally-determined disposition" intended as a "form of social etiquette representing courtesy to others when one is feeling sick."

Craig Poland arrived at his Downtown printing business at daybreak, expecting the worst.


   


  His big storefront window on East Gay Street was still intact. His alley-side door and window off East Lynn Street were not.


   


  "It looks like they threw a brick through the window and then went in and ransacked the place," Poland said, surveying the damage at Capitol Square Printing and trying to figure out what to next.


   


  He's never seen anything like the past two nights in Ohio's capital city, where protesters have broken windows, sprayed graffiti and otherwise voiced their anger about police brutality and injustice.


   


  Capitol Square Printing has been in business for more than 40 years. Other than occasional vandalism, "We never had any problem here," Poland said.


   


  He added, "I think it's crazy. I think it's uncalled for. I don't understand it. I don't agree with what happened to that man (in Minneapolis). That was uncalled for. I don't see this even lends to that -- this is a different state. Why they attacking the businesses?"


   


  Poland and other business owners were poised for more destruction Saturday night, as long-simmering racial tensions boil over across the country, following the death of George Floyd at the hands of police in Minneapolis.


   


  "At the core of everything that we're seeing is the need for the conversation around racism in America," said Franklin County Commissioner Kevin Boyce. "You can see it happening in all major cities across the country right now… People are angry, they're frustrated… What you're seeing is a waking up of America around the need for change."


   


  Boyce and other officials continued Saturday to urge peaceful protests and larger community conversation and action to address racial disparities and inherent racism. County officials earlier this month declared racism as a public health crisis, with vows to do something about it.


   


  "It's unfortunate that violence and destruction of property has pressed into this conversation," Boyce said. "I think it distracts from the broader conversation. At no level do I personally condone (violence and destruction)... We'll do everything we can to protect lives and property… There's a concrete effort to clamp down on these outbursts of aggression. We're calling on all protesters to protest in a peaceful way, in a nonviolent way."


   


  Saturday morning Downtown, bricks and rocks and pieces of granite, the latter from walkway squares around the Statehouse, were strewn on sidewalks and in the street, along with empty water bottles and other debris.


   


  A business sign was blowing down Broad Street just south of High Street. There were a couple of mangled metal chairs, a smashed oversized flower pot and demolished landscaping and building fixtures all around.


   


  And lots of busted windows, from WesBanco Bank at East Lynn and North Third streets to the Sprint store at Broad and Gay, with empty phone case packaging all over the street. Few storefronts were left unscathed.


   


  As one African American man standing on East Gay Street put it, "all because of one a--hole cop."


   


  "There's a lot of angry poor people, and because of the coronavirus, who have been locked down… ," said Tim, a Columbus man who declined to give his last name. "… 400 years of suppression and all the other cops that got away with it… People are angry, and this is the way that we're showing anger, is to say listen, we're going to shut down businesses of all these rich people... It's no more going to the hood and burning up s---. It's going to be like hit the pockets in the financial district."


   


  Business owners property managers and passersby on East Gay Street were reluctant go on the record with The Dispatch on Saturday morning as they cleaned up their premises or gazed at the aftermath.


   


  Many were boarding up shattered windows. Others were trying to determine how to attach plywood to unbroken panes to stop further damage.


   


  Poland didn't know if he could even get boards in place before dark.


   


  "They're supposed to be coming back tonight," Poland said. "When's it going to stop? … I'm just going to pray they don't come back and break out the front tonight."

We have just surpassed the 100,000 death mark for COVID-19 in the United States amidst projections of a resurgence in the fall, and the wearing of a basic face mask or cloth face covering in the community is now considered a necessary non-pharmaceutical intervention (in conjunction with other protective measures) for prevention and control.This emphasis on mask- wearing is in stark contrast to earlier advice against it. That change was prompted by the highly contagious and virulent nature of SARS-CoV-2, along with mounting evidence of asymptomatic and presymptomatic spread. The CDC now estimates that about 35% of COVID-19 infections are asymptomatic, and 40% of transmission is occurring prior to symptom onset. Nonetheless, public compliance with mask-wearing remains a challenge, and this could be attributed, in part, to misguided messaging about the benefits of face masks or cloth face coverings.This messaging emphasizes that you wear a mask to protect others from you, not you from others. I believe this is counterintuitive and counterproductive. Although the scientific evidence in support of the potential protective value of mask-wearing to the wearer is sparse and of varying quality, it can be considered meaningful, nonetheless. A few experimental studies (not specific to COVID-19) have suggested that face masks may help to protect the wearer from acquiring various infections or transmitting infection. Additional support for the protective value of a face mask to the wearer can be inferred from an experimental animal study involving healthy and COVID-19-infected hamsters in separate cages, with a surgical mask used as a partition between them and serving as a proxy for the hamsters wearing a mask or not. This experiment documented significant protection for the uninfected animals.Unfortunately, the message that masks have no benefit for the wearer detracts from the perceived benefit, which is a salient and statistically significant determinant of preventive health behavior, and thus this messaging undermines public health efforts to stem the pandemic.Indeed, population control of COVID-19 requires a collectivist mindset, consistent with the public health adage a case anywhere is a risk everywhere, but this is easier said than done, especially in societies (including the U.S.) that are often characterized as individualistic; that is, geared toward self-protection rather than the common good. Mask-wearing has been characterized as a culturally-determined disposition intended as a form of social etiquette representing courtesy to others when one is feeling sick.Best practice in public health aims for evidence from true experiments or randomized controlled trials, but such information is lacking for mask-wearing and COVID-19; however, triangulation of the available evidence can provide a reasonable guide for decision-making in this regard. The totality of the evidence addressed herein signals a potential protective value of a face mask or cloth face covering to the wearer against respiratory droplets, and this information should be included in messages about mask-wearing in the context of COVID-19 to facilitate more informed individual cost-benefit analysis toward the adoption and maintenance of this protective measure. In the words of FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn, MD, social distancing, hand washing, and wearing masks protect us all.Rossi A.

BRASILIA: Brazil on Saturday reached 28,834 coronavirus fatalities, authorities said, surpassing hard-hit France and becoming the country with the world's fourth-highest death toll.


  At the epicenter of South America's coronavirus outbreak, Brazil also saw an increase of 33,274 cases in the past 24 hours -- a new daily record, the Health Ministry said.


  That number brings Brazil's total caseload to 498,444, the second-highest in the world, lagging only behind the United States.


  Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro remain the hardest-hit states in Brazil in terms of sheer numbers, while per capita rates are higher in the country's impoverished north and northeast, where health facilities are reaching capacity.


  Brazil's Ministry of Health has indicated "there is no way to foresee" when the country's outbreak will peak, and experts say the number of cases could be 15 times higher than the confirmed figure because there has been no widespread testing.


  The pandemic is spreading across Brazil under a cloud of confrontation, as governors and mayors implement restrictive measures while President Jair Bolsonaro, who has pinned his hopes of re-election on a booming economy, has berated them for imposing what he calls "the tyranny of total quarantine."


  The US death toll now stands at 103,685. The United Kingdom, meanwhile, has a toll of 38,376 and Italy stands at 33,340, according to a latest count by AFP.
