The bank made no change to its 1.35 trillion ($1.58 trillion) pandemic emergency bond purchase program, which pumps newly created money into the economy to keep credit flowing to businesses and promote economic activity. Those regular purchases are set to run through the middle of next year. Analysts say that is one reason the bank is holding off increasing the amount, since there is plenty of stimulus still in the pipeline.

Algood Foods Company is an essential employer. And if you've been working and parenting under the same roof for even some of the past seven months, then you'd no doubt agree.
 See, Algood makes peanut butter and jelly. It produces the sandwich staples for grocery chains, which sell them in stores under their own brands. Essential, to be sure: When the pandemic hit, U.S. demand for peanut butter mushroomed 75%. And the Louisville, Kentucky, company's factories were ready to roll.
 But when it came to a recipe for keeping its 350 workers healthy, company executives had to start from scratch. Algood had no technology to leverage for its COVID-19 response. And because many line workers don't bother with email, the company didn't even have a reliable way to alert them to procedural changes, or for workers to report symptoms and test results.
 "We were using our bulletin boards and a phone tree. And we quickly realized that was just too antiquated," said Kelly Zeilman, Algood's vice president of human resources.
 Working from home, in your bed? You're not alone. Mattress sales are soaring during the pandemic.
 Many companies were in the same boat.
 Popular cloud-based work-from-home tools like Zoom, which helped keep professionals safe and productive at home, don't extend well to the front line. So they've turned to technologies designed to limit exposure to the virus, like virtual health checks and social distancing aids. High-touch communications, many find, play an outsized role in their success.
 Toward that end, Algood deployed a smartphone app called Redeapp to connect management and workers. This summer, the company added an electronic form that workers fill out each morning. Even if a worker feels healthy, the app might send them home or for tests if they've been in contact with someone with symptoms.
 A different scale
 When it comes to protecting folks who work from work, even high-tech companies' first order of business was the low-tech quest to secure personal protective equipment, or PPE. Of course, you can't just head over to Amazon.com to find millions of masks and thousands of thermometers. Even if you are Amazon.
 Like many companies, Amazon had a difficult time finding - and vetting - masks, thermometers and hand sanitizers. "We spent a lot of time testing those products," said Cathy Hovde, principal industrial hygienist at Amazon. "We needed them for our associates. But we didn't lower our bar on safety because we were having supply chain issues like everyone else."
 Amazon health and safety officials said they did manage to quickly secure enough PPE for workers. For a time, the company said it even tested - and ultimately purchased - hand sanitizer from distilleries, which had pivoted last spring to produce PPE. All told, the giant e-tailer said it purchased 151 million masks, 30,000 handheld thermometers - even enough plexiglass to build about 5,000 stands to protect folks doing temperature checks.
 From there, Amazon said it started its higher-tech response by leveraging existing equipment. Jane Bourke, Global Leader, Health and Safety Technical Solutions at Amazon, told me that one team, for example, developed an algorithm to repurpose security cameras to gauge how well sites were adhering to social distancing protocols. Today, that algorithm also powers Amazon's "Distance Assistant," a mobile workstation that reminds workers in high- traffic areas to maintain space.
 Early this month, Amazon announced that in just over six months, the company had 19,816 positive or presumed positive cases of COVID-19. While that sounds like a lot, it represents only 1.44% of the 1.372 million front-line workers Amazon employed over the time span - less than the national average.
 Going forward, Amazon is focused on shoring up its COVID-19 test capabilities to help better identify and isolate infections. The company soon plans to perform 50,000 tests a day across 650 sites.
 Contact tracing
 At Ford Motor Company, the few workers on the job last spring weren't just using PPE. They were also making it.
 Ford had stopped making vehicles, though it signed on to make items like respirators, medical gowns and face masks. And to help keep workers safe, Mark Goderis, Ford's Digital Engineering Manager, set out to help workers maintain proper social distance and to generate contact tracing reports when someone came down with COVID-19.
 To do that, Goderis' team switched gears on a project that was using Bluetooth to locate bins inside Ford's massive plants. The team customized Samsung's Galaxy Watch Active2 smartwatches, using Bluetooth to help gauge how far devices - and, by proxy, workers - were from one another, and Wi-Fi to send the data to the cloud.
 "Rather than asking 'Who have you been in contact with?' and have you go back in your memory, I can have the answer in five or 10 minutes," Goderis said.
 The union's shop chairperson "was very excited for the technology," he said. "There was a global pandemic and all of our manufacturing facilities were closed. Michigan was a hot spot. So they wanted the people making those medical devices to know that they were safe when they came into work."
 That's something everyone hopes one day to take for granted again. As everyday as, well, peanut butter and jelly for lunch.

GORHAM — The end of the regular season arrived out of thin air, and while Penn Yan claimed another the Finger Lakes West title, the Finger Lakes East title will at the very least belong to Palmyra-Macedon.
 The Red Raiders (7-3, 7-3) used a strong performance on Wednesday night against Marcus Whitman (7-3, 7-3) to win the match 4-1 and claim at least a share of the Finger Lakes East title.
 “I think as the year’s gone on we have really improved steadily,” Pal-Mac head coach Tane Robinson said. “Players have been working hard and definitely gotten better with each match and we seem to be putting it all together at this time.”
 Pal-Mac will wrap up its regular season this Saturday against Penn Yan, while Marcus Whitman concluded its regular season on Wednesday afternoon.
 “I’m super proud,” Marcus Whitman head coach Bryan Law said on his team’s performance over the course of the season. “I’m super proud that we’re 7-3 and the only team’s we lost to was the number one team in Penn Yan and the number two team in Mynderse. I’m very proud of their efforts.”
 At the No. 1 singles position, Marcus Whitmans Caty Goodman faced Pal-Mac’s Heather Weaver. Goodman used her strong and consistent backhand along with a few power forehand’s to cruise to victory. Weaver’s strong serve and forehand were not enough and Goodman’s 10-3 victory gave her team it’s first win on the day.
 Unfortunately for the Wildcats, that would be the lone victory.
 The 1 and 2 doubles teams saw Pal-Mac win both with scores of 10-2 at No. 1 and 10-4 at No. 2. Sophie Lyko and Anna Kubasiewicz secured the Wildcat win at the No. 1 doubles spot while Kaleen Anderson and Katie Schreills secured the win at the No. 2 doubles spot.

When Woodcock meets Alma (Vicky Krieps), who serves him breakfast and gets his order right, he takes her into his house as his lover and muse. Their relationship is, to say the least, a little intense. Day-Lewis is nominated for an Oscar, as is Lesley Manville, who plays Woodcock's sister.

Reed told reporters Wednesday he anticipates the presidential race between President Donald Trump and Joe Biden “is going to be close,” and will come down to a half-dozen states. The recounts could take weeks and lead to a George W. Bush v. Al Gore situation, he said.
 The 2000 presidential race between Bush and Gore was decided when the Supreme Court ended a recount of Florida’s ballots.
 Counting absentee and military ballots won’t start for weeks in some states. Absentee ballots postmarked by Nov. 3 will be accepted in New York. Some states require absentee ballots to be received by Election Day.
 The recanvasing and litigation associated with it could go on for some time, Reed warned.
 “We’ll have a better sense on how long it will be” after Election Day and early votes are counted on Nov. 3, Reed said.
 The results of early voting and Election Day voting in the 23rd Congressional District will be an indication of how many absentee votes would be needed to overcome returns from early and Election Day voting. Those absentee ballots often break similarly to the results at the polls.
 Due to COVID-19 concerns, large numbers of voters in Cattaraugus County and others across the state have requested absentee ballots.
 In the telephone press conference set up by the Reed campaign, Reed also expressed deep disappointment that Democrats and White House negotiators had been unable to agree on a $2 trillion COVID-19 stimulus/relief package.
 Reed, co-chairman of the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus in the House, had urged both sides to continue negotiating, even after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said it was not his priority.
 Commenting that he was waiting for a call from Treasury Secretary Stephen Mnuchin, Reed said that if the two sides couldn’t come with an agreement in the next few days, he doubted anything would happen until January or February.
 The winner of the presidential race and who will control the Senate are also factors in when a stimulus bill will be voted on, he said.
 “If people think the White House and Senate will flip, they will hold out,” Reed said.
 “It’s a shame,” he continued. “A lot of people are suffering.” A plan B and C need to be developed, he added. “The focus is on politics.”

 The vaccine will enable the economy to get growing again and bring back manufacturing jobs, he said,

Dall’assessora regionale all’Istruzione Elena Chiorino arriva _“un grazie sentito a Tigotà per l’attenzione rivolta al Piemonte e la sensibilità verso il sistema dell’istruzione, ancora una volta messo a dura prova dall’emergenza sanitaria in corso. Il fatto che un’azienda cosi importante si dimostri attenta anche al nostro territorio non solo ci lusinga, ma ci conferma un potenziale di grandi sinergie che possiamo sviluppare con il mondo imprenditoriale per risollevare l’economia in momento davvero delicato per tutti. La scelta di destinare la donazione alle agenzie formative è dovuta alla grande attenzione del Piemonte verso una realtà fortemente radicata sul territorio, che sta garantendo nonostante le difficoltà l’operatività del sistema. Insieme alle misure regionali di sostegno alle agenzie_ – prosegue Chiorino – _questa donazione aiuterà concretamente studenti, insegnanti e operatori a lavorare e studiare in sicurezza”._

Are we looking at a repeat of the dollar melt up in 2016?As Biden leads in the polls, almost everyone has been talking up the case for a 'blue wave' and what scenarios may take place should that happen.The straightforward one being "buy everything, sell the dollar" of course, but there are some risks associated with that once the euphoria begins to fade.For bank trade ideas, check out eFX PlusOver the past ten months, I grew from thinking Trump would easily win this election to thinking that Biden should have this in the bag, judging by the lead in the polls. But now, I'm less confident of that outcome as we approach the home stretch.I would still argue that the base case remains for a 'blue wave' but Trump winning once again and stealing this election is not within the realms of being unworldly, if you ask me.As a trader, it's best to be prepared for all outcomes and eventualities, so what is the trade if we do see another four years of Trump in the White House after next week?Is it going to be the total opposite of the reaction if we see a 'blue wave' outcome?The biggest clue that the market has to go on is the 2016 melt up in the dollar, where we saw the greenback smash everything in its wake - especially EM currencies.In case you forgot, we had USD/JPY going from 101.20 to 118.00 in the span of just over a month and even EUR/USD tumbled from 1.1300 to near 1.0300 in that time.This time around, I don't think we will see a repeat as convincing a surge in the dollar; going past the initial reaction to the election result that is.The knee-jerk reaction may still be a rush to the dollar based on the 2016 narrative, alongside four more years of geopolitical uncertainty with the market also not really anticipating the result to be the 'base case' outcome given election pricing.I would say equities will also rally alongside the dollar on the result as we all know Trump prides himself on the stock market and Biden's tax increases can be cast aside.If Republicans hold the Senate, that will add to the optimism in stocks as stimulus hopes would be renewed as well.But the stock market reaction is a pretty straightforward one, all things considered.Beyond that, the real trade would be to fade any dollar euphoria on a Trump victory.As the global economic recovery continues to encounter more setbacks and the Fed not going to even consider hiking rates in the next 5 years possibly, fiscal and monetary support is here to stay for a long, long time.Essentially, we're returning to the pre-election status quo and I don't see how that changes the narrative that the dollar is arguably in the early stages of a multi-year decline.While equities may still be rocked from time to time on virus jitters and negative economic developments, the big picture is that the dollar is likely to falter as long as the Fed keeps their word in the medium-to-long term.That should see more flows into EM currencies, with the reflation trade narrative only adding reason for investors to pile more money into gold as well.If a 'blue wave' is characterised by a "buy everything, sell dollar" reaction (at least in terms of a knee-jerk reaction potentially), then a Trump victory should be characterised by a "buy stocks, then sell dollar" reaction (one which is arguably more straightforward).

The recent coronavirus outbreak has had a massive impact on several economies across the globe. Due to the rapid spread of the disease, several countries are looking to implement strict measures with a view to controlling the spread of the disease. The measures taken to curb the spread of the diseases have affected businesses across all sectors. Although several healthcare businesses have benefited from the Covid-19 pandemic, the US C-arms market is among the very few who have not derived any significant growth. In fact, the hesitancy among people has delayed the orthopedic procedures and this will have a negative impact on the US C-arms market in the coming years.

But this edition will probably be best read in tandem with the 1831 version. For that edition, with the author revealed and the story still shocking, there was likely some pressure on Shelley to create a slightly more pious impression. But she had lost children, siblings, and her husband in the interim, and in some ways the later edition reflects a life defined by grief (she notes that the book echoes "many a walk, many a drive, and many a conversation, when I was not alone; and my companion was one who, in this world, I shall never see more.") The fatalist turn of the 1831 text might be an attempt by Shelley to make sense of loss and loneliness as much as an attempt to gentle a legacy.

About a dozen members of the Resistance Revival Chorus, a group of women and nonbinary vocalists based in New York City, performed protest songs on site. ArinMaya Lawrence, a 38-year-old singer/songwriter who recently moved from New York City to Philadelphia, was among them.
 “It was wonderful being part of the energy that was sustaining people in the process of getting out to the polls,” Lawrence said. “But it should not be a two-and-a-half hour wait. That is absolutely a form of voter suppression. Nevertheless, it was wonderful to be a part of it and keep people’s energy and spirits up while they endured.”
 When the chorus wrapped up its performance, a DJ took over and began playing classic line-dancing songs like the “Cha Cha Slide,” “The Wobble,” and “The Electric Slide.”
 “He played all of the slides,” Lawrence said. “As a Black woman, line dancing is one of our traditions. This is what we do at barbeques and all of the parties. Everyone was going crazy. It was just beautiful.”
 Cooper didn’t want to get out of the long line just to do “The Wobble,” but he was halfway up the ramp leading into the school with plenty of room around him when the “Cha Cha Slide” came on.
 “And the rest is history,” he said.
 Cooper led the other voters in line through the dance and even “put a little spice” on his moves while members of the Resistance Revival Chorus, dressed all in white, danced in step below.
