Edin Dzeko has confirmed his hope that Henrikh Mkhitaryan will stay with Roma beyond the summer transfer window, having enjoyed a spell on loan from Arsenal this term.


  The Armenian all-time top goalscorer has struggled to break into the Gunners first-team plans since joining from Manchester United in January 2018, in a deal which saw Alexis Sanchez go in the other direction.


  Mkhi has since enjoyed a return to regular action in the Italian capital, and talks are believed to be in the pipeline for a permanent move for the 31 year- old, although the asking price may well prove a stumbling block.


  There has been talk of a possible swap deal, but until the full extent of the financial implications of the current suspension of football are known, talk of a fee may have to be put off.


  Despite the uncertainty, Edin Dzeko has insisted that he is keen to see Mkhi stay with the club into next season.


  Dzeko said: “I have always liked [Mkhitaryan] as a footballer and now that I have known him I can say that he is a very good person and a fantastic player, we want to keep him and we hope that he stays.


  “We need people like him to make important results.”


  The Bosnian is also his country’s all-time goalscorer, with both players having more than double the amount of goals scored of their nearest rival for the tag, also left the Premier League on an initial loan deal in order to find more regular first-team football, before joining permanently.


  It remains to be seen whether the current world pandemic will effect the transfer between the clubs, although all recent talk suggests his future will be at Roma.

Fremont (US), May 12 (AP) Tesla CEO Elon Musk is restarting its California factory in defiance of local government efforts to contain the coronavirus.


  In a tweet Monday, Musk practically dared authorities to arrest him, writing that he would be on the assembly line and if anyone is taken into custody, it should be him.


  State law allows a fine of up to $1,000 a day or up to 90 days in jail for operating in violation of health orders.


  The plant in Fremont, a city of more than 230,000 people south of San Francisco, had been closed since March 23.


  Early Monday, the parking lot was nearly full at the massive factory, which employs 10,000 workers, and semis were driving off loaded with vehicles that may have been produced before the shutdown.


  The restart defied orders from the Alameda County Public Health Department, which has deemed the factory a nonessential business that can't open under virus restrictions.


  The department said Monday it warned the company was operating in violation of the county health order, and hoped Tesla will "comply without further enforcement measures" until the county approves a site-specific plan required by the state.


  The department said it expects Tesla to submit such a plan by 5 pm Monday.


  "We look forward to reviewing Tesla's plan and coming to agreement on protocol and a timeline to reopen safely," the statement read.


  No agency appeared ready to enforce the order against Tesla.


  County Sheriff Sgt. Ray Kelly said any enforcement would come from Fremont police. Geneva Bosques, Fremont police spokeswoman, said officers would take action at the direction of the county health officer.


  County Supervisor Scott Haggerty, who represents Fremont, said he's been working on the issue for weeks trying to find a way for Tesla to reopen in a way that satisfies the health officer.


  He said officials were moving toward allowing Tesla to restart May 18, but he suspects Musk wanted to restart stamping operations to make body parts needed to resume assembling electric vehicles.


  Tesla planned to maintain worker safety, including the wearing of gloves and masks and social distancing.


  Haggerty said the company initially pushed back on checking employee temperatures before boarding a company bus to get to work. But Tesla relented, he said, and agreed to check workers.


  "I'm seeing emails going back and forth between the plant and our public health department so I'm encouraged by that, and that's what I mean by cooler heads," he said.


  "There's a lot of people whose lives depend on that plant opening safely." The restart came two days after Tesla sued the county health department seeking to overturn its order, and Musk threatened to move Tesla's manufacturing operations and headquarters from the state.


  Tesla contends in the lawsuit that Alameda County can't be more restrictive than orders from California Gov. Gavin Newsom. The lawsuit says the governor's coronavirus restrictions refer to federal guidelines classifying vehicle manufacturing as essential businesses that are allowed to continue operating.


  "Frankly, this is the final straw," Musk wrote in a now-deleted Saturday tweet. "Tesla will now move its HQ and future programs to Texas/Nevada immediately."


  He wrote that whether the company keeps any manufacturing in Fremont depends on how Tesla is treated in the future.


  Newsom professed not to know if Tesla had reopened. "Not aware (of) the details of that," he said.


  "I have great expectations that we can work through at the county levels," the governor said about conflicts involving the Fremont plant.


  He said county health directors are in charge of restrictions and the timing of any resumption of manufacturing.


  Alameda County was among six San Francisco Bay Area counties that were the first in the nation to impose stay-at-home orders in mid-March.


  The order in the Bay Area has been extended until the end of the month, but the counties plan to allow some limited business and manufacturing starting May 18, the same day Detroit automakers plan to reopen auto assembly plants.


  The governor has repeatedly said that counties can impose restrictions that are more stringent than state orders. Early in the coronavirus crisis, Newsom praised Musk as the "perfect example" of the private sector assisting the state in the pandemic.


  His comments came after Musk pledged to provide more than 1,000 ventilators to California hospitals, a fact Newsom repeated often and called a "heroic effort." But whether Musk made good on the promise remains in dispute.


  Several weeks after Newsom was touting the ventilators, the state said it hadn't heard of any being delivered.


  Musk responded, demanding on Twitter that Newsom correct the record and sharing tweets and screenshots from hospitals and Los Angeles County thanking him for sending supplies.


  Musk has been ranting about the stay-home order since the company's April 29 first-quarter earnings were released.


  He called the restrictions fascist and urged governments to stop taking people's freedom.


  The coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms for most people. But it has killed nearly 80,000 people in the US, with the death toll rising.


  Despite Musk's threat, it would be costly and difficult to quickly shift production from Fremont to Texas or Nevada. The Fremont facility is Tesla's only US vehicle assembly plant, and the company would lose critical production if it shut down the plant to move equipment. (AP)

  Kim Hall is part of ‘Love to Move’, the British Gymnastics Foundation’s popular seated activity programme used by many older people across Cambridgeshire, but which has now been made available online for free and expanded to help more people during the current lockdown.


  Hall is the lead deliverer of the nationwide programme designed to get older people moving and functioning better by increasing strength, flexibility, co- ordination and stimulating the brain.


  The majority of the programme is based on movement patterns, which work the left and right sides of the brain separately, benefiting older people and particularly those living with dementia and mild cognitive impairment.


  Two online sessions have been made available by the Foundation, partner charity of national governing body, British Gymnastics, with more free sessions to follow.

  With those likely to benefit most currently isolating at home, the programme, which has also been adapted to allow for social interaction ‘to screen’, can now benefit more lives than ever before.


  Hall, who features in the online classes, said: “The best thing about delivering Love to Move is seeing people’s quality of life improve. To see someone moving again, feeding themselves and re-engaging with their loved ones, and to see them visibly appear younger, brighter, more confident and happier is such a privilege.

Some of the deportees who came back from South Africa escaped from the Beitbridge Quarantine centre and efforts to locate for them are underway.      Zimbabwe has been receiving large numbers of people coming back from other countries in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.      The mandatory quarantine period is 21 days, with testing conducted on the first, eighth and 21st days, according to the government's latest testing plan for returning residents and international travellers.      Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Information, Publicity and Broadcasting Services, Ndavaningi Mangwana confirmed eight people absconded from Beitbridge.      "There are 197 people at Beitbridge Quarantine Centre as of today (Tuesday).111 males, 64 females, 11 boys and 11 girls. Eight absconded and 22 were discharged. 49 are still awaiting their PCR results (that is COVID-19 results tested from the Polymerase Chain Reaction machine).  Efforts are underway to account for those who absconded," he said on his Twitter platform.      According to Statutory Instrument 77 of 2020, Section 6 (4-5), it is a criminal offence for a person to leave any place of detention, isolation or quarantine without clearance and may be arrested without a warrant.      They are liable to ﬁne not exceeding level 12 or to imprisonment for a period not exceeding one year.      In an interview with CITE, Deputy Minister of Public Service, Labour and Social Welfare, Lovemore Matuke, said some returnees did not understand the importance of quarantine.      "They are not treated like prisoners but deal with friendly units when they come in to the country. The returnees come in large numbers and the ratio does not match number of police officers on the ground to watch them," he said.      Matuke said returnees needed to be educated on why going on quarantine was important.

Kyle McElvany resigned as Dundee's football coach in late February.


  Everyone in the community knew that replacing him would be a big hire.


  The Vikings are coming off a season that saw them qualify for the state playoffs for the first time since 2012. And the school is in process of building a new football field, thanks to a $1 million gift from former Viking John D. Craig.


  They had to get this right.


  So, athletic director Tom Oestrike took a little time to make sure he had the right procedures and right committee in place.


  He could not have predicted the delay that would throw a wrench in the process.


  Dundee had whittled its original list of 17 applicants down to five candidates to interview when the coronavirus pandemic hit Michigan hard.


  In late March, school was canceled for the rest of the year and the Michigan High School Athletic Association called off the remainder of winter sports season and the entire spring campaign.


  But Dundee still had to complete its task. A new coach needed to be picked in time to direct summer workouts.


  So Oestrike and his committee turned to the only option they had left - virtual interviews.


  "We didn't officially post the job until the last week of February," Oestrike said. "We were thinking we were going to be busy anyway, then coronavirus hit.


  "Everyone was in shock. We thought, 'Oh my gosh, it's real.' We had the committee formed. We just had to make sure we were all on the same page."


  The committee was made up of high school principal Bryan Schroeder, volleyball coach Shayna Munson, athletic secretary Judy Henning, football player parent Kim Salenbien, junior football program coordinator Aric Bennett and football player Carson Irwin.


  "We would rather not do interviews on internet, but it's the best we could do," Oestrike said.


  By the time interviews were set to begin, everyone on the committee was tired of being isolated.


  "We were happy to see each other," Oestrike said. "It was exciting at that time. It was good to see different faces."


  The committee met online and tested the technology before the interviews began. The five candidates met with the committee over a three-day period.


  "A couple of the coaches had never done anything like this before," Oestrike said. "It was very new to them. And it was new to us, too.


  "Sometimes that helped break up the nervousness. We would say something like, 'Hey, coach, look at the camera a little more.' That kind of got a laugh out of them."


  But the candidates had the advantage of doing the meetings in their own homes rather than being marched into an interview room.


  "When you're interviewed in the comfort of your own home, you tend to be more relaxed," Oestrike said. "They could be themselves more."


  Each of the interviews lasted about an hour.


  The committee thought the process went well.


  "It's always really nice to sit down face to face, but the Zoom process worked very well," Schroeder said. "I guess it's the next best thing to an in- person interview. You can see someone's responses. It was a very powerful way for us to get to know the candidates."


  "It went as well as it could go," said Salenbien, whose son Zack is a sophomore at Dundee. "We were able to communicate on Zoom and see faces and body language. That helped us understand them and talk about their skills. It ran pretty smooth."


  "I thought it went good," said Irwin, who will be a junior this fall. "Seeing the candidates and their mannerisms helped us understand what they were saying."


  Oestrike always likes to incorporate an athlete into coaching searches.


  It was even more valuable this time to have Irwin involved. As the youngest member of the committee, he was more familiar with the technology being used than the others.


  "Carson took it very seriously," Oestrike said. "He did his research. He was great."


  And Irwin kept the meetings lighthearted by needling the head of the committee.


  "He was making fun of me when I kept losing my connection," Oestrike said. "He said, 'Coach, I am surprised you even know how to turn on a computer.'"


  Having the technology to do the interviews online was great, but everyone on the committee wished it could have been done the old-fashioned way.


  "I would rather get back to face-to-face," Oestrike said. "There is something about looking someone in the eye to know where they are coming from."


  "Interviews are much better in person," Irwin added.


  The process worked out well for the man who eventually got the job.


  Ross Crow currently lives in Arizona, but was anxious to return to his Michigan roots. He was fully prepared to fly back for an interview, but coronavirus travel restrictions saved him the cost of a flight.


  "For me as a tech-savvy person, it wasn't anything abnormal. It wasn't anything I hadn't experienced before," Crow said of the digital interview. "It was definitely a little intriguing and, if anything, it worked in my favor.


  "I was really comfortable at home on my own computer. I was able to open up and show my true self."


  Oestrike is convinced that Dundee landed the right coach.


  And the entire committee learned some valuable lessons along the way.


  "This could be the way we are doing things for a while," he said. "People have to adapt."

Peri implant disease is associated with two main entities - peri-implantitis and peri-implant mucositis. Peri-implant mucositis is an inflammatory reversible reaction in the soft tissues which surrounds the dental implant. Peri-implantitis is defined as an inflammatory reaction with results in the loss of bone surrounding the tissues and the dental implant.Anaerobic plaque bacteria can show a bad effect on peri-implant tissue health which can lead to peri-implantitis disease. Inadequate distribution of the chewing pressure on the tissues surrounding the implant can cause peri-implantitis disease.Peri- implantitis treatment is a major concern as peri-implantitis disease leads to infection of the surrounding tissues, loosening of the artificial supports, and can also cause inflammatory processes. Peri-implantitis can result in bone loss around the implant and eventual loss of the implant. Peri-implantitis treatment is needed when the occurrence of dental failures shows a major effect on the dental tissues and can lead to peri-implantitis disease. Bacterial infections play an important role in dental implant failures. Gram- negative anaerobes are mainly associated with dental implant failures such as Porphyromonas gingivalis, Bacteroides forsythus, Prevotella nigrescens, etc. Healthy peri-implant tissue acts as a biological barrier to the agents that can cause peri-implantitis disease. Destruction of healthy peri-implant tissue can lead to the bacterial contamination which spreads directly to the bone. Other factors that can develop peri-implantitis disease are the poor design of the implant, corrosion, excessive mechanical stress etc. Along with these factors, other etiological factors such as osteoporosis, smoking, radiation, and chemotherapy are responsible for peri-implantitis disease. The destruction of crestal bone which is usually saucer-shaped, destruction of vertical bone leading to the formation of peri-implant pocket, bleeding of gums, toothache, swelling of peri-implant diseases are the symptoms of peri-implantitis disease. The parameters used in the diagnosis of peri-implantitis disease include clinical indices, bleeding on probing, mobility and peri-implant radiography. The peri-implantitis treatment can be done either by surgical methods or nonsurgical methods. The peri-implantitis treatment can be done only by antibiotics or antibiotics along with mechanical debridement. Laser treatment along with mechanical debridement can also be used for peri- implantitis treatment market. Tetracyclin is used for peri-implantitis treatment.

Aberdeen, Partick Thistle and Stenhousemuir had publicly backed the resolution.


  And Falkirk and Inverness CT, who have missed out on possible promotion, had criticised the league body.


  After coronavirus caused the suspension of football in March, clubs were balloted about ending the Championship and Leagues One and Two and awarding titles on an average points basis. The resolution also proposed giving the SPFL board the option to curtail the Premiership if it deems the 49 outstanding fixtures cannot be played.


  Dundee had submitted a no vote which the league initially said was never received, before changing to a yes. Had Dundee voted no, the resolution would not have passed.


  SPFL chairman Murdoch MacLennan said after the result of Tuesday's ballot about Rangers, Hearts and Stranraer's call for an independent investigation: "The last few weeks have been bruising ones for many people in our game.


  "Far too many words have been spoken and written which have sown anger and division amongst clubs. That is a matter of the deepest regret to very many people in our game, myself included.


  "I know those who proposed this resolution will be disappointed, but I trust that everyone involved, on both sides of this argument, will now respect the clear, democratic and decisive result we have seen today and allow our game to move forward together.


  "The overwhelming majority of clubs voted to oppose this resolution and it's now incumbent on all clubs to put their differences aside, otherwise we will all suffer together.


  "I have taken careful note of the concerns expressed by the minority of clubs which voted in favour and when we are back to playing football in a safe environment, I will bring clubs together to discuss the lessons learned.


  "In reality, we must do everything humanly possible to get games back up and running by the end of July. We simply cannot afford the distraction of further infighting or legal challenges.


  "I'm sure we can all agree that the quicker we get back to playing football, the better."

Fishermen will deliver salmon to Kiwkpak’s tender boats as they have in the past, but crews receiving the fish will wear gloves to winch the haul on board and unload the fish.


  There is usually at least 6 feet (1.83 meters) or more between staff on the larger tender boat and the fishermen in skiffs, but this year jumping between boats will not be permitted.


  How to pay fishermen without making contact is a detail still being worked out, the company said.


  The company plans to isolate any workers who contract COVID-19 before medivacing them to a medical facility.


  “KwikPak has community support behind it, or else this wouldn’t be happening,” General Manager Jack Schultheis said.

DUBAI, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News / WAM - 12th May, 2020) The healthcare and pharmaceutical sectors in Dubai and the UAE have shown a remarkable level of readiness and capabilities in facing COVID-19 and its associated challenges, according to an analysis of the Department of Economic Development in Dubai (Dubai Economy).


  Dubai's ability to mount a robust response to the crisis has shown that its sustained focus on attracting large-scale investments in infrastructure as well as research and development related to healthcare, pharmaceuticals and medical equipment has been a prudent strategy, it found.


  Pharmaceuticals and medical equipment constitute one of the six priority sub- sectors in the Dubai Industrial Strategy 2030, which aims to transform the emirate into a global platform for knowledge-based, sustainable and innovation-focused industries, Dubai Economy noted, adding that COVID-19 has made it imperative to continue investing in these sectors for improved readiness to meet emerging challenges.


  The role of the leadership in promoting investment and excellence in the healthcare sector in the UAE has received global attention, especially in light of current circumstances. Following the COVID-19 outbreak, His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President, Prime Minister and Ruler of Dubai, chaired a cabinet meeting, in which he issued directives to draft a post-COVID-19 UAE development strategy and hold intensive Federal as well as local government meetings to highlight key changes and identify our development objectives as well as our upcoming agenda.


  He also asked for an urgent plan to be prepared in order to raise the level of productivity and competitiveness of the healthcare industry in the country and formed a working group headed by the Ministry of Energy and Industry.


  He stressed that the new teams are required to work in a faster and more comprehensive manner; further response is needed to accelerate daily changes and our national priorities need to be reviewed by the post-COVID-19 world. He said that financial and human resources need to be redirected, and country's medical, food, and economic security needs to be further entrenched through new programmes and projects. "Preparation for the post-COVID-19 world is the preparation for a new future that no one expected only months ago," His Highness said.


  Data from the Dubai FDI Monitor indicates that Dubai has attracted 55 foreign direct investment, FDI, projects in the healthcare, pharmaceutical, and medical equipment sectors over the past five years, with a value of AED 3.82 billion.


  Dubai Economy has expected that the federal cabinet’s approval for the first list of economic activities open to 100 percent foreign ownership in accordance with the Foreign Investment Law Dubai will attract further foreign investments into various health sectors.

Think of it this way, the last couple Pirates movies really weren't the same caliber as the first three, as On Stranger Tides and Dead Men Tell No Tales felt like they were all over the place, and the last movie really feels as though it ended any chance of the allure that the Pirates movies could hold considering that breaking a symbol that abolishes all curses at sea leaves a lot of questions. What happens now if another curse is laid, or can another curse be laid upon anyone? At that point it almost feels as though any magic left in the seafaring adventure would be gone for good. Thanks to creative writing there are ways to bring it back, but so much care has to be taken to make it so that the room for error is next to none. Bringing Karen Gillan in as a female lead could be a great idea, so long as she's given the kind of edge she needs in both a comedic and dramatic sense, meaning a sort of female Jack Sparrow character that is her own unique self and has the strength of character needed to take on such a role. Think back to Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, and remember the scene of Jack sailing into Port Royal. The proud yet nearly penniless captain, riding a sinking ship into the bay, his eyes set upon the near horizon, and none of us knowing until we saw just how dire his situation really was.

HILO, Hawaii (AP) — Observatories on Hawaii's highest mountain started resuming activities following a forced closure in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Observatories within the Mauna Kea Science Reserve on the Big Island have been closed since March, The Hawaii Tribune-Herald reported Monday. The observatories were among nonessential businesses and facilities closed in accordance with Democratic Gov. David Ige’s emergency proclamation to mitigate the spread of the coronavirus. Ige issued an updated proclamation allowing certain establishments to reopen Thursday, including astronomical observatories. The Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope was able to resume nighttime observations, executive director Doug Simons said. “I was pleased to see a night log with some actual data after so long,” Simons said. Canada-France- Hawaii’s internship program, which attracts several dozen interns every year, has been suspended indefinitely because of the state’s mandatory 14-day quarantine for arriving travelers, Simons said. Despite the green light to reopen, the observatories may not return to full operations for some time. \"We’re going to be going at a slower, more deliberate pace,” said John O’Meara, chief scientist at the W. M. Keck Observatory. “We have two telescopes up there, and we’re going to get them live one at a time.” The majority of Keck’s employees are still working from home, with only a skeleton crew being sent to the summit each week to comply with social distancing guidelines, O’Meara said. The additional safety measures needed to sanitize shared surfaces will extend the time before the observatory is back to full capacity, O’Meara said. “I don’t know when we’ll be beginning science operations again, but as soon as we can...

Sears, Jake’s co-owner, says it’s difficult to control human behavior inside a hospitality environment, let alone on the sidewalks outside. He suggests that it’s difficult to ask a group to break up if they’re talking too close together, though he emphasizes that he and his staff tried.


  “At any point if there was something that didn’t look safe we’d politely ask them to move apart,” Sears says. “At the same time, again, there has to be personal responsibility here.”


  “I think we opened in an extremely responsible fashion,” he adds. “If I had determined that I couldn’t open in a safe manner, I wouldn’t.”


  Adedokun, the War Mouth bartender, suggests that the onus should be on government leaders, not restaurants and their workers, to figure out how to best balance the weighty concerns associated with reopening.


  “I feel like it’s wrong and irresponsible [to keep] the public safe on the back of the business owners and the workers, which is what it’s being done, instead of the buck stopping at the top of the totem pole,” he opines.

Les équipes japonaises de baseball professionnel pourraient reprendre le chemin des stades après la mi-juin, a annoncé lundi le président de la ligue nippone, suscitant des espoirs parmi les fans de ce sport extrêmement populaire dans l'archipel. Atsushi Saito, le président de la ligue japonaise de baseball professionnel (NPB), s'est entretenu lundi avec des experts des questions sanitaires, mais aussi avec les représentants des équipes de baseball professionnel du pays. «Les 12 équipes ont accepté d'oeuvrer pour que la saison puisse redémarrer dans la deuxième quinzaine du mois de juin, à condition que tous les préparatifs aient été effectués, tout en suivant de près l'évolution de l’épidémie», a déclaré M. Saito dans un communiqué. Il a laissé entendre que le huis clos faisait partie des options envisagées, mais sans préciser quelle était la préférence de la ligue ou des équipes.


  Avant son annonce, des médias locaux avaient déjà rapporté que la saison pourrait reprendre dès le 19 juin. M. Saito a toutefois estimé qu'il était trop tôt pour fixer une date précise, disant vouloir observer la situation à Taïwan et en Corée du Sud, où les équipes professionnelles ont repris leurs activités. Le Japon, avec quelque 16.000 cas d'infections au coronavirus et environ 620 décès, a été nettement moins touché par la pandémie que la plupart des pays d'Europe et les Etats-Unis. Le nombre de nouveaux cas quotidiens recensés a nettement diminué ces derniers jours, et le gouvernement devrait prochainement lever l'état d'urgence dans une grande partie du pays, ne le laissant en place qu'à Tokyo et dans d'autres régions les plus touchées.

BETHEL, Alaska (AP) — An Alaska fish purchasing and processing company plans to open this season while reducing interaction with members of the public during the coronavirus pandemic. KwikPak Fisheries LLC says it will operate its Yukon River facility in Emmonak this summer, KYUK-AM reported Sunday. The company worked with Emmonak and state officials and health care providers at the Yukon-Kuskokwim Health Corporation to devise an operation plan in the midst of the COVID-19 outbreak. KwikPak staff will undergo a quarantine in Anchorage before arriving in Emmonak at the end of the month. The quarantine will include testing to ensure staff members are free of the coronavirus before taking chartered flights to the village. After landing in Emmonak, staff will transfer directly to the salmon processing plant and remain there until the fishing season ends. “We have the necessary equipment and will keep our distance, with no contact with locals,” said Darren Swain, KwikPak medical and safety director. Fishermen will deliver salmon to Kiwkpak’s tender boats as they have in the past, but crews receiving the fish will wear gloves to winch the haul on board and unload the fish. There is usually at least 6 feet (1.83 meters) or more between staff on the larger tender boat and the fishermen in skiffs, but this year jumping between boats will not be permitted.

The city of Wuhan will begin what they are calling "ten days of mass battle" to test all 11 million residents after the discovery of a new cluster of coronavirus cases, NPR's Emily Feng reported.


  Each of the city's districts is required to created a testing plan by Tuesday, according Reuters, which first reported the initiative.


  Wuhan, where the world's first coronavirus cases were reported in late December, eased many restrictions in early April after a strict lockdown. But earlier this week, authorities found at least six new cases, the first to be confirmed in Hubei province in more than a month. Now the city will test all of its residents over a 10-day period.


  All six new cases came from the same residential compound, and included an 89-year-old man. Five of them never had symptoms, Feng reported. The city has been trying to find asymptomatic carriers through a random testing initiative, which it started in April.


  In response to the outbreak, the city's top Communist Party official vowed to bulk up testing efforts across the city, Feng reported. It also fired an official because of the cases, accusing him of "poor management over the closing-off and control of the Sanmin residential community," according to the state-run People's Daily.

"They need education of the importance on quarantine to their families, friends and fellow countrymen. But some don't understand it," said the deputy minister.      He claimed there was a possibility that those who would have escaped could have been criminals who did not want to be arrested.      "Some of these people would have committed crimes then run away to South Africa for hibernation. Now when they are here and have a chance to run away, they do. It's a mixed bag of people who come back to the country. Some are genuine, some are not genuine.      "Those who are not genuine would have committed crimes such as murder, theft or some would have run away from their families or have pending cases. It is not everybody who is genuine. Profiling is underway at Beitbridge but go with a camera, some may run away not wanting to show their faces," Matuke explained.      Matuke said quarantine centres were not prison facilities but their aim was to provide security.      The deputy minister acknowledged that his department was focused on the people's welfare and was not up to speed with security issues at the centres.      "As for the bigger picture, why some absconded may not come from social welfare but security. I am giving you an answer from a social point of view," Matuke said.      He lamented that the escapees left at a time when testing could have been in progress.      "They could have absconded anytime in the process. I don't know if they had done testing but they should have gone for proper testing.  I am not sure if they had completed that, I don't have enough information but once testing is done, they graduate to leave," said the deputy minister.      There is a possibility that if the escapees had not tested but were positive for COVID-19, they could transmit the virus to others, a point which the deputy minister concurred with.      "It is correct to say they can infect others but it doesn't eradicate that police will follow up on them. Some may have crossed back into South Africa but police will find them since details were taken during profiling.

This is the seventh in a series of columns featuring some of the most memorable moments I’ve had as a reporter for this publication. The articles are in no particular order and the topics were selected based solely on how memorable they are to me.


  The Class of 2008 brought a lot of attention our way.


  The group of local high school seniors that year included some talented and highly recruited athletes who generated much interest for that February’s National Signing Day. It was before there was an early signing period for football athletes so Signing Day was a little more exciting.


  Among the highly touted seniors was A.J. Green, who had given his verbal commitment to the University of Georgia during his junior year of high school. As a Bulldog fan, I anxiously awaited the day he could make that commitment official. After all, many athletes change their mind after giving a college verbal commitment so I wouldn’t allow myself to celebrate too much until Green’s decision was formalized.


  On Feb. 6, he made it official and went on to three great seasons with the Dawgs before being drafted into the NFL.


  Another future professional player kept his decision closer to the vest. There was a little more drama at Fort Dorchester that day as Robert Quinn turned down offers from colleges such as Alabama and Auburn and signed with the University of North Carolina.


  Even Pinewood Prep had a football player sign with a Division 1 program, which isn’t something the private school can boast as often as Summerville and Fort Dorchester. Ryan Steed signed with the Furman University Football program.


  Athletes from other sports also formalized their college plans. Rudi Hellberger became the first Fort Dorchester soccer athlete to sign with a Division 1 program. Summerville senior Stacee Roberts signed with the University of South Carolina Track and Field program.


  Below is my article from Feb. 6, 2008:


  High school Signing Day in Dorchester County wasn’t without any surprises this year, but for the most part things went as expected.


  A dozen high school seniors gathered with friends and family at their respective schools to announce where they would be spending most of their time the next few years. The county has several big time football recruits in the Class of 2008 and on Wednesday some of them signed a national letter of intent with a Division 1 program.


  Summerville seniors A.J. Green, Reid McCollum and David Behr all honored the verbal commitment they had already given to their program of choice.


  At Fort Dorchester, senior Robert Quinn announced he would be a Tar Heel. Quinn had narrowed down his choices to North Carolina, Auburn and Alabama. He said on Tuesday evening he decided to sign with Auburn, but then had a change of heart Wednesday morning.


  “I stayed up thinking it over and thought I had made the choice, but then I woke up this morning and realized North Carolina was the place for me,” he said. “I just had a gut feeling and knew UNC is where I want to be. It’s an up and coming program and I just like the coaches there. I feel most comfortable with North Carolina.”


  Quinn’s high school football season was cut short when he had a brain tumor removed. Some speculated he would never play again, but he never had any doubts. He said if it is up to him, he won’t red shirt.


  “I was ready to play the day after I got out of surgery,” he said. “For now I will concentrate on the rest of the wrestling season and then I will start preparing for football.”


  After giving his verbal commitment to Georgia in the Fall of 2006, Green officially became a Bulldog.


  “Since I was a sophomore, I knew where I was going so today was pretty easy,” he said. “This is a relief. Now I can just focus on academics and finishing the basketball season strong.”


  In the past few years, Georgia Head Coach Mark Richt made a couple of trips to Summerville to talk to Green and watch him on the basketball court. Green said after talking to Richt, he is optimistic about his future at UGA.


  “He told me he would like to give me the opportunity to become a big-time receiver, to be the go-to guy,” Green said. “Hopefully, I will be able to play as a freshman and get better each year as a player and a student. Georgia has a young team and I think we will be real good in the future.”


  McCollum was so committed to the Gamecocks that after graduating high school early, he enrolled at USC this Spring. He decided early enrollment wasn’t all it’s cracked up to be and returned home, but did sign Wednesday and will return to Columbia in the Fall.


  “I’ve always wanted to go up there and play so it’s pretty much a dream come true for me,” he said. “I’ll likely be red shirted, but that just gives me an extra year to get my feet on the ground and figure things out. Eventually, I’m going to have my chance to play and then I will have to take advantage of it. For now, I’m working out and throwing so hopefully I’ll be ready for everything in the Fall.”


  Behr had decided to go to the Naval Academy, but changed his mind after visiting the Air Force Academy.


  “I would like to be a pilot so that’s the place to be,” he said. “I like that after college I know I will have a job for five years and the coaches are great. That program is something that I really want to be a part of.”


  Wednesday also marked the first time that a Fort Dorchester soccer player had signed with a D-1 college. Rudi Hellberger signed with the College of Charleston.


  Others who signed Wednesday include Richard Spain (SHS, football), Hutchinson Community College; Marcus Morris (SHS, football), Fort Scott Community College; Justin Ball-Collins (SHS, football), Chowan University; Stacee Roberts (academic), University of South Carolina; Tony Mack (FDHS, football), Newberry College; Ryan Hall (FDHS football), Presbyterian College; and Ryan Steed (Pinewood Prep, football), Furman University.

TORONTO -- The organization representing Ontario's nurses says the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for sweeping reforms to the province's health-care system.


  The Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario is updating its previous calls for change in part by incorporating lessons learned from the deadly outbreak that's killed at least 1,600 people in the province so far.


  The Association says the health-care system is too focused on hospitals and should instead concentrate on providing comprehensive primary care for all.


  It sets out 13 recommendations in a report dubbed ECCO 3.0.


  Those recommendations include a call to integrate long-term care homes in Ontario's regional health teams to ensure they don't fall through the cracks of the health-care system.


  Other recommendations include extending primary care into settings like homeless shelters, modernizing staffing and housing models in congregate care settings, and expanding primary care to include addiction and mental health services.


  "There is a crying need to enhance community care as we take stock of lessons-learned during COVID-19. Precious lives were lost due to weaknesses in our health system, in particular the neglect of congregate settings such as nursing homes, retirement homes and shelters," the Association said in its report. "We must seize the moment to build a stronger health system for all who call Ontario home."


  This report by The Canadian Press was first published May 12, 2020.

BAZELON: You're right about creating a great deal of uncertainty. There's another way to think about this, which is that it's a bargaining chip in the negotiations over money, over funding from Congress. We've had this dynamic in the last couple of months where it's Democrats who are trying to protect essential services, parts of the government - this includes the election funding we were talking earlier - and Republicans who have been resisting. And so sometimes, you know, when you take an unreasonable position at the beginning of negotiations, you force the other side to rush in and say, wait. Wait. We need that. And then something that should be kind of obvious becomes a concession that you're making to the other side. And I wonder if that is also informing the dynamic that we're seeing here with the post office.

And, you know, one additional point to make is, even if you still think it's important to have the polls open, you reduce the burden on the polling places. There are fewer people there.

And so I think for a lot of students, this has just been a real sad loss.

Beijing, May 12 (PTI) China on Tuesday released a list of 79 American products which will be exempted from the second round of retaliatory tariffs imposed at the peak of the bilateral trade war, as it faced fresh pressure from the US to import more to end the bruising dispute.
 This is the second list of American goods to be excluded from the second round of tariff countermeasures against the US Section 301 measure, according to a statement from the Customs Tariff Commission of China's State Council.
 The exemption will be valid from May 19, 2020, to May 18, 2021, it said.
 There are 79 products in total on the list published on Tuesday by the Ministry of Finance that included rare earth mineral ores, aircraft radar equipment, semiconductor parts, medical disinfectants, and a range of precious metals, chemical and petrochemical products.
 The first batch of exclusions was announced in September 2019, and included major agricultural commodities such as soybeans and pork, as well as petrochemical products.
 Tariffs that have already been levied will be refunded, the statement said. The remaining US products subject to China's second round of additional tariffs will not be excluded for the time being, it said.
 For US products that are not on the first two lists, the commission advised enterprises to apply for the exemption of additional tariffs following a specific product list that applies to domestic firms which plan to sign deals to purchase and import these products from the United States in a market- oriented and commercial fashion, the state-run Xinhua news agency reported.
 The US and China signed the phase one deal on January 16 to end the 22-month- long trade war during which two countries slapped tit-for-tat tariff hikes over nearly half a trillion USD worth of products.
 Under the January deal, China agreed to increase its purchases of US goods from a 2017 baseline by USD 200 billion over two years.
 China's announcement comes at a point when two countries are engaged in fiery exchanges over the origin of the coronavirus pandemic that had cast a shadow over the deal.
 US President Donald Trump last week threatened to tear up the phase one trade deal if China did not increase its imports of US goods, as per the purchasing agreement element of the deal.
 Trump had launched the trade war with China in 2018 demanding Beijing to reduce the massive trade deficit.
 The US goods trade deficit with China was USD 419.2 billion in 2018.
 His demands included an intrusive verification mechanism to supervise Beijing's promise to protect intellectual property rights (IPR) technology transfer and more access to American goods to Chinese markets.

Jammu, May 12 (PTI) The Jammu and Kashmir administration Tuesday allowed the operation of stone-crushers in the union territory after 50 days of closure due to coronavirus lockdown.


  The Department of Industries and Commerce allowed the operation of stone- crushers with a view to ensure supply of construction material such as sand and stone aggregate, especially for ongoing development projects, an official spokesman said.


  Brick kilns have already resumed their operations in the Union Territory from April 16.


  "The Government of J&K; has allowed some select additional activities for resumption of construction activities during the lockdown period by the construction departments.


  "The representatives of Industry have highlighted the necessity of operation of Stone Crushers to meet the demand of sand and aggregate. Industries & Commerce Department examined the issues and allowed the Stone Crushers as covered under government order to operate subject to fulfillment of all requisite norms as prescribed by the Government of J&K; for operation of Stone Crushers," the spokesman said.


  He said Director Industries and Commerce, Jammu, Anoo Malhotra, and Director Industries & Commerce Kashmir, Mahmood Ahmad Shah, issued separate orders for operation of stone-crushers in their respective divisions subject to fulfilment prescribed norms.


  Commissioner Secretary, Industries & Commerce Department, M K Dwivedi expressed hope that with the operation of stone-crushers, the supply chain of construction activities for development projects would be ensured.


  He also emphasized the need for ensuring social distancing and safety measures on unit premises.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk is restarting its California factory in defiance of local government efforts to contain the coronavirus.In a tweet Monday, Musk practically dared authorities to arrest him, writing that he would be on the assembly line and if anyone is taken into custody, it should be him.State law allows a fine of up to $1,000 a day or up to 90 days in jail for operating in violation of health orders.The plant in Fremont, a city of more than 230,000 people south of San Francisco, had been closed since March 23.Early Monday, the parking lot was nearly full at the massive factory, which employs 10,000 workers, and semis were driving off loaded with vehicles that may have been produced before the shutdown.The restart defied orders from the Alameda County Public Health Department, which has deemed the factory a nonessential business that can''t open under virus restrictions.The department said Monday it warned the company was operating in violation of the county health order, and hoped Tesla will &quot;comply without further enforcement measures&quot; until the county approves a site-specific plan required by the state.The department said it expects Tesla to submit such a plan by 5 pm Monday.&amp;ldquo;We look forward to reviewing Tesla''s plan and coming to agreement on protocol and a timeline to reopen safely,&quot; the statement read.No agency appeared ready to enforce the order against Tesla.County Sheriff Sgt. Ray Kelly said any enforcement would come from Fremont police. Geneva Bosques, Fremont police spokeswoman, said officers would take action at the direction of the county health officer.County Supervisor Scott Haggerty, who represents Fremont, said he''s been working on the issue for weeks trying to find a way for Tesla to reopen in a way that satisfies the health officer.He said officials were moving toward allowing Tesla to restart May 18, but he suspects Musk wanted to restart stamping operations to make body parts needed to resume assembling electric vehicles.Tesla planned to maintain worker safety, including the wearing of gloves and masks and social distancing.Haggerty said the company initially pushed back on checking employee temperatures before boarding a company bus to get to work. But Tesla relented, he said, and agreed to check workers.&amp;ldquo;I''m seeing emails going back and forth between the plant and our public health department so I''m encouraged by that, and that''s what I mean by cooler heads,&quot; he said.&amp;ldquo;There''s a lot of people whose lives depend on that plant opening safely.&amp;rdquo; The restart came two days after Tesla sued the county health department seeking to overturn its order, and Musk threatened to move Tesla''s manufacturing operations and headquarters from the state.Tesla contends in the lawsuit that Alameda County can''t be more restrictive than orders from California Gov. Gavin Newsom. The lawsuit says the governor''s coronavirus restrictions refer to federal guidelines classifying vehicle manufacturing as essential businesses that are allowed to continue operating.&amp;ldquo;Frankly, this is the final straw,&amp;rdquo; Musk wrote in a now-deleted Saturday tweet. &amp;ldquo;Tesla will now move its HQ and future programs to Texas/Nevada immediately.&amp;rdquo;He wrote that whether the company keeps any manufacturing in Fremont depends on how Tesla is treated in the future.Newsom professed not to know if Tesla had reopened. &amp;ldquo;Not aware (of) the details of that,&quot; he said.&amp;ldquo;I have great expectations that we can work through at the county levels,&amp;rdquo; the governor said about conflicts involving the Fremont plant.He said county health directors are in charge of restrictions and the timing of any resumption of manufacturing.Alameda County was among six San Francisco Bay Area counties that were the first in the nation to impose stay-at-home orders in mid- March.The order in the Bay Area has been extended until the end of the month, but the counties plan to allow some limited business and manufacturing starting May 18, the same day Detroit automakers plan to reopen auto assembly plants.The governor has repeatedly said that counties can impose restrictions that are more stringent than state orders. Early in the coronavirus crisis, Newsom praised Musk as the &amp;ldquo;perfect example&amp;rdquo; of the private sector assisting the state in the pandemic.His comments came after Musk pledged to provide more than 1,000 ventilators to California hospitals, a fact Newsom repeated often and called a &amp;ldquo;heroic effort.&quot; But whether Musk made good on the promise remains in dispute.Several weeks after Newsom was touting the ventilators, the state said it hadn''t heard of any being delivered.Musk responded, demanding on Twitter that Newsom correct the record and sharing tweets and screenshots from hospitals and Los Angeles County thanking him for sending supplies.Musk has been ranting about the stay- home order since the company''s April 29 first-quarter earnings were released.He called the restrictions fascist and urged governments to stop taking people''s freedom.The coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms for most people. But it has killed nearly 80,000 people in the US, with the death toll rising.Despite Musk''s threat, it would be costly and difficult to quickly shift production from Fremont to Texas or Nevada. The Fremont facility is Tesla''s only US vehicle assembly plant, and the company would lose critical production if it shut down the plant to move equipment.

"We were so looking forward to hosting our big VIP grand opening events," Foti said.


  As COVID-19 spread through the nation and the world and severe restrictions were placed on businesses and organizations to fight the spread of the virus, it became clear any sort of normal opening would be out of the question.


  However, the need for such facilities continues, and area families continued to sign up to house their loved ones at The View, unless care was needed so urgently their loved one had to move to another facility before The View opened.


  This continuing need led planners to work toward a June 1 "move in" date, with no fanfare and no visitors allowed inside the building, and additional layers of precautions to keep new residents safe.


  "We are following all DHS protocols," Foti said. "It's not right to have vulnerable residents move in and then throw a big party," she said.


  "Now we have to be very protective of our residents who will be moving in, so there will be no big events for a long time for us," she said. "But yes, we are accepting move-ins as of June 1."


  When the facility opens, Foti said planners anticipate continuing restrictions on visitors which will make it impossible to offer the kind of entertainment and enrichment opportunities they had originally envisioned making available to residents.


  However, staff members are working hard to provide "in-house" programs.


  The administrator of the Oconomowoc facility is an accomplished violinist, for example, and has been doing concerts at the sister facility. Activity coordinators have also brought a horse to the property and toured the horse around the perimeter of the Oconomowoc facility so residents could see it through their windows.


  They have also worked to connect residents to family members quarantined elsewhere through video calls and conferences.


  "We meet with families on an individual basis to help them through the transition," Foti said.


  Overseeing the construction process was general contractor Consolidated Construction out of Appleton.


  The Johnson Creek facility has room for 64 residents. There will be four wings, two for memory care, two for assisted living residents whose needs are primarily physical.


  Where the four corridors join is the "hub," with an activity center, salon, rooms for on-site health care providers, and labs with X-ray capability.


  The facility will have professional nurses on staff, two licensed nurses in the building.


  Despite the necessity of a "low-key" opening at this time, Foti said that The View is really excited to join the Johnson Creek community.


  "We have been fortunate to have an outpouring of welcome, even during this strange time," Foti said. "A lot of the leaders of the community have reached out to us."

With a significant disparity between the supply and demand for housing, Investors see BTR as a positive solution to increasing supply. Many of these developments in the pipeline are utilising the specific Apartment Design Standards for BTR launched in 2018 to support the delivery of purpose-built BTR. In fact, 2020 is expected to see the opening of the first BTR schemes designed in accordance with this guidance, which clearly shows the infancy of the Irish BTR market.”

MADRID -- Spain ordered a two-week quarantine on all travelers arriving from abroad from this Friday in a bid to prevent visitors from sparking a second wave of the coronavirus, a move that will further harm a tourism sector already reeling from the epidemic.


  One of the world's worst-hit countries, Spain has largely brought the outbreak under control within its borders and has begun to relax its tight lockdown regime.


  The main risk now lies in importing new cases from abroad, Health Emergency Coordinator Fernando Simon told a news briefing.


  "We have to do prevention efforts until other countries reach the level of control that we have achieved," he said.


  Health ministry data showed the daily death toll rising to 176 on Tuesday from Monday's seven-week low of 123 and bringing the total to 26,920. But the number of diagnosed cases rose by just 594 overnight to 228,030 - its smallest daily rise in about two months.


  An official order published on Tuesday said the quarantine would apply to all travelers arriving between May 15-May 24, when the country's state of emergency is due to end.


  Vsitors must remain indoors, only allowed out for groceries, to visit health centers or in a "situation of need."


  Truck drivers, airplane and ship crews, cross-border workers and health staff working in Spain will be exempt.


  The government had previously imposed restrictions on traveling from outside the open-border Schengen Area, which includes most of the European Union countries and other European states such as Norway.


  The order can be prolonged with possible state of emergency extensions. Spain has so far extended its restrictions four times since mid-March.

  Further restrictions on movement could spell disaster for Spain's vital tourism industry, which draws some 80 million annual visitors and accounts for around 12% of gross domestic product in the world's second most visited country.


  Gloria Guevara Manzo, chief executive of the World Travel and Tourism Council, said the government should make it clear that the rule is only intended to last as long as Spain maintains restrictions on movement.


  "If confinement is lifted and this 14-day quarantine policy is maintained, unfortunately that would put the country at a competitive disadvantage," Guevara told reporters on a conference call.


  Shares of International Consolidated Airlines, which owns the Iberia airline, were down 1.2%, in afternoon trade, while shares of Melia Hotels, whose largest market is Spain, were down 4.8%.


  Spain has embarked on a four-step plan to wind down its lockdown and aims to return to normality by the end of June. About half the population moved into Phase 1 on Monday, with cafes and bars allowed to reopen their outdoor seating with capacity restrictions.


  However, the move did not go smoothly everywhere, as crowds formed outside some bars, in an infringement of social-distancing rules, forcing police to shut down the establishments in some cases.


  On Tuesday, the Guardia Civil police force said it had reported to the national government Sunday's Iberia flight to the Canary Islands from Madrid for breaking coronavirus safety rules on social distancing. After complaints from some passengers, police in the Canaries discovered the aircarft was more than 70% full.

BY the time they hit their 30's most guys will know what they like and what suits them when it comes to clothing.   In most cases, we'll spend our teens and our 20's experimenting with our personal style but the flirty thirties are when we really lock it down.   The key to dressing in your 30's is in establishing a list of labels that suit your body and your personal aesthetic.   Buy well and buy in bulk because as you move into your fourth decade on this earth your priorities will inevitably change from things like fresh kicks and sick fades to things like career advancement and starting a family.   And while T-shirts, jeans and trainers will still feature heavily on weekends, suits will become increasingly important this decade. Even if you work in a job with a strict uniform or a trade, your diary will be filled with words like ‘wedding' and ‘christening' so it's in your best interests to suit up and suit up well.   It's not all grown up doom and gloom however because your 30's is also the decade where you start giving back to yourself.   You should have the basics down by now, so use your thirties to invest in the occasional luxury item that's going to last you years– and look damn good doing it.   Quality leather jackets and designer trainers are great additions to any man's wardrobe, but make sure you also set some funds aside for classics: a beautifully made bag for work, a go-anywhere overcoat or an umbrella that doesn't look like it was previously owned by a circus clown.   To cut a long story short, it's time to grow up – literally and in terms of your style. But this isn't bad news and here are a few handy tips to help you along the way...

BAZELON: That's right. The states are under a lot of pressure to make these changes. These are expensive changes to make. In the long run, voting by mail can save money, but not when you have to make this big switch to your system. So one example I found was, in Michigan, they've received $11 million for all election expenses from Congress. There has been a little bit of funding so far. That's all election expenses related to the pandemic. They've already calculated that it would cost them $40 million just to supply mailing costs for November and then another special election they have in August. So you can just see here that the costs are much greater than the resources the states have on hand.

Employees at these factories work closely together, and thousands nationwide have become infected with the novel coronavirus. At least 20 have died. As their workers fall ill, the plants have lowered capacity or temporarily shut down.   The plants’ diminished capacity means some beef can’t get processed, and that has thrown cold water on the market for cattle: Why pay top dollar for the animals if you might not be able to sell them later?


  That’s a problem for California, the nation’s fifth-largest cattle-producing state. In a good year, commercial ranchers could aim to get more than $1 per pound for a premium calf. Now, the expected price has dived 15% to 25%, said Mark Lacey, president of the trade group California Cattlemen’s Assn.


  “We’ve had some major droughts, we have had some bad market years, but this is unlike anything I’ve ever seen,” said Megan Brown, a sixth-generation cattle rancher and manager of Brown Ranch in Plumas and Butte counties. “Even in the family history, nothing compares to this.”

Everyone Is So Concerned’


  McMaster’s May 4 return to outdoor dining fell in line with a South Carolina Restaurant and Lodging Association reopening proposal given during accelerateSC meetings, the team of state and local government officials and business leaders that the governor formed to determine the best way to reopen South Carolina’s economy. McMaster’s May 11 easement of restrictions also lined up with the proposal’s timeline, as it details that indoor dining should resume by May 18, adding that some restaurants that are particularly capable of doing so safely could get back to serving customers indoors by May 11. It further suggested easing social distancing regulations depending on the public health at a later, untargeted date.


  It mirrors what other states, particularly in the South, have decided to do. Georgia was the first to begin to reopen closed businesses, and others, such as Texas and Alaska, have followed suit.


  While it remains to be seen how conditions progress and if McMaster will continue to follow the restaurant reopening proposal, some owners reported strong results from their initial returns, and a positive response from their staff, as well.


  Five Points’ Publico received attention when it decided to re-close on May 5. Some local media reports indicated the closure came after May 4 and May 5 crowds were too large for the business to feel comfortable exposing its employees.


  But co-owner Michael Duganier claims that isn’t the case, and that the restaurant and bar planned all along to reopen for two days and then re-close for work needed on the building. He says that his workers, mostly college students, enjoyed their shifts despite the crowds and attention.

While some schools have cut varsity sports teams or announced furloughs to deal with budget crunches caused by the coronavirus pandemic, The Citadel athletic director Mike Capaccio is hoping to avoid such drastic measures.


  Capaccio said last week that he hopes an across-the-board cut of 10 percent in the athletic department's budgets will be enough to prevent having to take the more extreme steps that other NCAA Division I schools have had to take.


  "Our money has been cut across the board right now, and we do have a financial hole to plug," Capaccio told Citadel supporters in a Zoom call last week. "But I feel very good that we are going to be able to do that this year.


  "But I'm a little worried about next year, so some of the steps we are taking are cutting budgets across the board, traveling closer to home, possibly having fewer competitions in some sports ... We are looking at a straight 10 percent cut across the board that will allow us not to have to furlough anybody or reduce coaches' salaries or things like that."


  The cancellation of the lucrative NCAA men's basketball tournament this year impacted all Division I schools.


  On March 26, the NCAA it would cut its annual distribution to Division I conferences to $225 million. That’s just 37.5 percent of its typical $600 million that was set to be distributed to those institutions at the end of the 2019-20 academic year.


  That has led to hardships of varying degrees. ACC member Louisville cut 40 positions in its athletic department and is furloughing an additional 45 people. Old Dominion University dropped its wrestling program. At Florida International, the athletic director has deferred his salary for one year, while the department will furlough 22 employees and cut the men's track and field team. Division II Florida Tech announced Monday that it will drop its football program.


  Also Monday, West Virginia announced that its athletic director and some coaches would take a 10 percent pay cut, while 65 athletic department employees will be furloughed for 60 days starting May 24.

Is It Worth It?’


  Debate about whether reopening restaurants is safe will undoubtedly continue, but one point remains clear: South Carolina is doing so against recommendations for what would best serve the public health.


  Per federal guidelines, one of the key tenets to reopening an economy is to have 14 consecutive days of declining positive coronavirus tests. That has yet to happen. In April, McMaster reasoned in a press conference that those “were just guidelines” and that he felt the state could move forward with reopening without endangering lives.


  Reporting done by _The Post and Courier_ ‘s Avery Wilks and Thad Moore showed the state needs more contact tracers, workers trained to identify infected individuals and locate those who could have been exposed, and testing to contain the outbreak as the economy reopened. The two reported that, by one model, the state will require about 1,500 contact tracers to effectively contain flare ups. The state currently has about 230 and hopes to hire about 1,000 more.


  Testing is a large part of federal guidelines and it has long been on the mind of some owners in Columbia. In April, Porter Barron, co-owner of The War Mouth, told _Free Times_ that more testing was needed for him to feel comfortable with reopening. Gardner echoes that, as well.


  But things could be improving.


  The state’s Department of Health and Environmental Control announced on May 6 that it had plans to test more than 200,000 people in the next two months. Columbia Mayor Steve Benjamin also announced plans last week to initiate virus testing for workers that are returning to work.


  Asked at McMaster’s May 8 press conference what kind of data South Carolina was seeing to green light further scaling back of restaurant restrictions, state epidemiologist Linda Bell pointed to the flattening of the state’s rate of infection and increases in testing.


  “We’ve seen a flattening of the curve for a relatively short period of time and we’re hopeful that flattening remains [as we increase testing],” she elaborated.


  Sigma Xi’s Vernon says that if health guidelines are being followed and protective is gear provided, then public-facing employees should feel confident in returning to work. He cites things like occupancy restrictions and one-way aisles in grocery stores as measures that can still help.


  Still, he worries that it can be difficult to follow these guidelines due to customer behavior, and some restaurant owners acknowledge this.
