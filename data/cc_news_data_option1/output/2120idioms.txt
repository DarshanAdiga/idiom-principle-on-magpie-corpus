But he’s worried the pandemic closures will hasten the permanent closure of more theaters and limit the types of movies that could succeed on the big screen.


  “I would hate that,” he said. “I’m old. I don’t know anything. For the new generation … they’re used to sitting at home. They don’t know what they’re missing. I fear it’s only a matter of time.”


  The National Association of Theatre Owners of Illinois unsuccessfully urged Gov. J.B. Pritzker to include theaters in Phase 3 of the state’s reopening plans.


  “It’s something that we’ve contemplated for Phase 4, lower capacity and so on, but not in Phase 3,” Pritzker said. “I know that the theater owners would like it to be in Phase 3. It’s just, it’s very difficult to imagine it happening.”


  The theater owners’ organization called for limiting attendance to 50 percent of seat capacity, rather than the 50-person limit for gatherings under Phase 4, and six feet of spacing between viewing parties in the theater.


  While Pritzker hasn’t yet agreed to those requests, the group’s CEO, Chris Johnson, said “we are encouraged and excited that we are in the conversation.”


  “Our biggest push is the capacity constraint, which we hope to alter,” he said.


  Even at 50 percent capacity, Koplinski wondered “how financially they’re going to make it,” noting that Goodrich Quality Theaters — which has a multiplex in Savoy — filed for bankruptcy protection earlier this year.


  “AMC was in trouble as well,” he said, though it was able to restructure its debt and expects to withstand closures until a partial reopening ahead of Thanksgiving.


  Koplinski is worried the only movies that theaters will pick up will be blockbusters — “the ones with a budget over $150 million,” he said — while smaller movies might go straight to streaming.


  This proved successful for the Trolls World Tour movie, which made more than $100 million in digital sales this spring.

LONDON -- British foreign minister Dominic Raab on Sunday defended the government's careful loosening of the coronavirus lockdown, saying it was the "right step to be taking" at this time.


  Prime Minister Boris Johnson has come under fire from some scientists for easing a lockdown put in place 10 weeks ago, with several saying it was a premature and risky move in the absence of a fully functioning system to track new outbreaks.


  Britain has one of the world's highest death rates from COVID-19 and the government says it is easing the stringent lockdown cautiously to balance the need to restart the economy while also trying to prevent another increase in the number of infections.


  "We are confident that this is the right step to be taking at this moment in time," Raab told Sky News. "We are taking those steps very carefully, based on the science but also based on our ability now to monitor the virus."


  From Monday, up to six people will be able to meet outside in England, some school classes will restart, elite competitive sport can resume without spectators and more than 2 million people who have been "shielding" will be allowed to spend time outdoors.


  Housing minister Robert Jenrick said the government was "reasonably confident" the easing would not boost the rate of infection, but some pictures of people apparently flouting the new rules has caused concern.


  England's deputy chief medical officer, Jenny Harries, emphasized the need for people to remain on their guard.


  "This is a really, really critical time. So where we are seeing (that) government is easing measures, the public really, really need to stick to those measures," she told a news conference.


  Johnson, meanwhile, is under pressure from some in his governing Conservative Party and businesses to start reopening the economy after spending billions to help to protect companies and workers from the impact of the coronavirus crisis.


  TEST AND TRACE


  At the heart of the strategy to ease the lockdown is a system to test and trace those people who have come into contact with confirmed cases of COVID-19.


  On Sunday, the government said it had met its 200,000 capacity testing target, including the means for 40,000 antibody tests a day, which health minister Matt Hancock described as "an important milestone."


  Ministers also say the tracing system is already working, though some scientists warned that it is too early to say whether it is fit for purpose and fear that it might not be able to cope if the lockdown easing increases the transmission rate.


  Britain has recorded more than 38,000 deaths from confirmed COVID-19 cases. The Office of National Statistics and other sources of data put the figure of fatalities from suspected and confirmed cases at 48,000.


  Peter Openshaw, a member of the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group and who sits on the government's scientific advisory group, said he shared other scientists' "deep concern."


  "I think unlocking too fast carries a great risk that all the good work that has been put in by everyone to try to reduce transmission may be lost," he told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show.


  Scotland's first minister Nicola Sturgeon, who has offered the nation slightly different guidance to that in England, agreed with scientists urging caution.


  "I agree with the opinion that has been expressed over the weekend that we've got to be very cautious," Sturgeon told Sky News. "This virus hasn't gone away, there is still a significant risk that it could run out of control again." (Reporting by Elizabeth Piper Editing by Alexandra Hudson and David Goodman )

  Hedger also noted that “the unmoderated world does exist,’’ pointing to Gab.com, which has become a haven for extremist views. “The unmoderated internet is not a pretty place,’’ he said.

  The White policeman’s brutality in the viral video was unspeakable. A handcuffed Black man named George Floyd lay on the ground groaning and repeatedly saying “I can’t breathe” to the officer who knelt on his neck for five minutes, ignoring pleas from distraught passers-by who were concerned that the man was going to die.


  Floyd, 46, later died in hospital, the latest victim of US police brutality against Black people. According to The New York Times, he had worked as a bouncer at a restaurant in Minnesota where the incident happened. And he did not pose any danger to the officer considering that he was handcuffed.


  The officer did not seem bothered at all as he brought the full force of his weight onto the victim’s neck. His left hand was in the pocket as he nonchalantly continued pinning the man to the ground with his knee. Another police officer simply looked on. Media reports said four officers were responsible for the brutality and had all been fired, but no sacking renews life.


  For people who keep track of news and current affairs in the US and other parts of the world, there is nothing new in this incident, of course. That Black people are treated appallingly badly in nearly all parts of the world is par for the course. It may not be happening on a daily basis, but whenever it happens, it is appalling and shocking.


  Why they have done this to us baffles me. We have never fought wars to colonise anyone. Yes, African chiefs sold people into slavery, but they sold Black people, not non-Black people. And if there were no buyers of slaves, there would be no sellers.


  We have never looted natural resources of countries of non-Black people. When we have done some looting—for example, when Uganda invaded the DR Congo and its soldiers stole the country’s mineral wealth—the looting has been Black on Black. History does not have examples of Black people mistreating non-Black people. It is the other way round.

Uganda, like Malcolm X’s America, seems to be divided against itself as half- field and half-house Negro. In the field, the ghettoes swarm with poor folk whose air of injured innocence has left them feeling robbed of all hope.   With few skills and even fewer opportunities, their bank balances are in the red. And so when they regard their condition, they see red with ‘people- powered’ intensity.


  This vision manifests itself in the form of rage towards a gerontocracy (rule of the old) which seems to treat government like a retirement home. So these greying leaders are not about to leave the house to go into the field.


  To them, it makes little sense to separate from the “masser” who comes in the shape of pay and perks at no cost to themselves. Yet this free lunch is paid for by a taxpayer shrinking under the deadweight of expanding public debt.


  The taxpayer seeks to unburden themselves of this cross and venture into the unknown, splintered by the thorny paths of activism. Any place is better than the place at which they find themselves.


  Tragically, the duality of these two Ugandas may lead to an Armageddon-like showdown. For we inhabit warring worlds, peopled by the haves and the have nots.


  When the two disagree, the former uses words like “bitter” or “disgruntled” to describe the latter.   This serves to delegitimise criticism against the former’s obvious excesses while the latter views the government as predatory and vampiric -- full of leaders who are the merest utensils to a feeding frenzy.


  A gulf between the two is thus widened to a pit large enough to accommodate us all in a mass grave.


  Moderates on both sides of this stalemate have been silenced. On the side of the Opposition, for instance, you cannot propose the Leninist tactic of infiltrating the State’s institutions without being labelled a sell-out.


  You must line the streets and gnash your teeth to prove you truly want change. The danger here, of course, is that resistance might become an end in itself; a way of life detached from the objective of ending the plight it protests against. When this happens, the Opposition becomes a debating society analysing freedom in its secondary colours.   Or it becomes a commemorative association ritualistically observing the anniversaries of heroic efforts and the deaths of martyrs by organising funerals for fallen loyalists to the cause.


  Before his death, Malcolm X joined forces with suspected “field Negro” Martin Luther King Jr.   And inadvertently sent a message to a divided world which stated that there were two kinds of slaves, but only one kind of bondage; from which only a love born of unity can unshackle us to strengthen our mystic chords of humanity.

Fishermen will make their way to sea in 120 mechanised boats in Thoothukudi district on Monday.
 The boats have been anchored since March 5, when mechanised boat fishermen started an agitation.
 It was followed by the lock down imposed on March 24 in the wake of the pandemic. About a fortnight later, the annual ban on fishing began on April 15, which ended on Sunday (May 31).
 The fishermen have stocked diesel, ice and other items, as they are optimistic about a huge catch due to the long hiatus in activity.
 Out of the 241 mechanised boats in the district, 120 will set sail on Monday, Wednesday and Friday, while the remaining will be permitted to fish on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday, officials said.
 Though the government has accorded permission for fishermen to begin fishing from June 1, the community in Rameswaram, Pamban and Thangachimadam hasdecided to stick to its decision to resume activity only on June 15.
 The decision was arrived at a meeting held last week, Jesu Raj, a fishermen association leader, told The Hindu.
 He says all fishermen have been confined to their homes since March 24 due to the national lockdown.
 Hence, repairs have to be carried out in a majority of boats that suffered minor damage under the the impact of Cyclone Amphan.
 Now that the State government has relaxed curfew guidelines, workers can repair the boats.
 Most importantly, exporters have pleaded their inability to take stocks from fishermen from June 1 as workers in their organisations, who are mostly migrants, have left for their native States.
 Hence, it has been decided that it may not serve the purpose for fishermen to go into sea from June 1.

A project to install a seawall along the toe of the bluff aims to change that path.


  "We are in danger of losing our bluff," said Dennis Nahnsen. "If we did nothing this year the homes would fall into the lake within a year or two or three."


  Dennis Nahnsen is president of the Wildewood Association, a group of 25 cottages located on Lake Michigan about two miles north of Frankfort. Eleven of those cottages are perched atop Sunset Slope, which is owned by the association.


  The group hired a consultant about a year ago when it became apparent that if nothing was done the 11 cottages would eventually be lost, said Nahnsen, of St. Louis.


  Permits for the seawall have been obtained from the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy and from the U.S Army Corps of Engineers. Steel sheets about 15 feet tall will be buried about 10 feet into the sand, with about 5 feet left visible.


  In 1986, when water levels were at a 100-year high, a similar wooden wall was placed along the shoreline. It soon got covered up with sand because the water receded and only an inch or so can now be seen, but it did serve to stave off erosion of the bluff for many years, Nahnsen said.


  This year, those high-water records are being broken.


  "At the low point we had 150 feet of shore," Nahnsen said. "Now we have none."


  Several of the property owners along the stretch of bluff had installed wooden seawalls back in 1986, most of which are now buried, said Tom Kucera, the consultant hired by the association.


  Kucera is confident the seawall now being installed will be enough to prevent scouring and keep the bluff from sloughing off. He is also confident water levels will go down.


  "The lake levels will recede and over time the seawalls are going to be covered again with sand and the beach will be there again," Kucera said. "The trick is having the crystal ball to know when it's going to happen."


  The bluff is all sand and when wave action scours its base the top of the bluff eventually collapses. Over the last several years, since water levels have been on the rise, the toe of the bluff has moved back about 40 feet, while the top has lost about 20 feet. Nahnsen's cottage is now about 25 feet from the edge of the bluff.

  Uganda never ceases to amaze, amuse and offend in almost equal measure. When you think things cannot possibly get worse, something obnoxious and repugnant pops up from nowhere. Most Ugandans are fed up and have switched off in protest or become immune to many absurd and outrageous happenings in our beloved country.


  How else can one explain the fact that before the dust has even settled down on a scandal involving Shs20 million Ugandan MPs illegally and shamelessly gave themselves, allegedly to fight the Covid-19 pandemic, a bigger scandal has been exposed by the media! More than 300 MPs of the NRM party are accused of receiving Shs40 million each.


  According to a front page story published in Sunday Monitor of May 17 titled, “MPs in fresh double-your-money bonanza,” MPs who betrayed Uganda in 2017 by supporting removal of the presidential age limit from the Constitution have been paid Shs40 million by Government Chief Whip Ruth Nankabirwa. The dubious deal was confirmed anonymously by some MPs after picking the cash bonanza. The Chief Whip has denied the story, but it’s an open secret in Kampala. It’s disgusting, outrageous and unacceptable!


  Where is the usually indefatigable minister of Ethics and Integrity, Fr Simon Lokodo, when the services of his docket are urgently needed by wananchi and taxpayers of Uganda whose hard-earned resources are being stolen in broad daylight by what John the Baptist would have called “a brood of vipers”?


  John castigated crowds who came for baptism at River Jordan: “You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath? Produce fruit in keeping with repentance.


  And do not begin to say to yourselves, we have Abraham as our father. For I tell you that out of these stones God can raise up children for Abraham. The axe is already at the root of the trees and every tree that does not produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire.” John 3 v 7-9 (NIV)   With general elections due in 2021, our votes are the equivalent of the John’s axe. I urge Ugandans to turn out in droves on election day and vote out unpatriotic MPs and others who have been exploiting, looting and plundering taxpayers’ hard-earned resources with impunity.

  “Facebook doesn’t want to alienate certain communities,” said Dipayan Ghosh, co-director of the digital platforms and democracy project at Harvard’s Kennedy School. “It doesn’t want to tick off a whole swatch of people who really believe the president and appreciate his tweets.”


  Twitter, on the other hand has a history of taking stronger stances, he added, including a complete ban on political advertisements that the company announced last November.


  That's partly because Facebook, a much larger company with a broader audience, caught in the crosshairs of regulators over its size and power, has more to lose. And partly because the companies' CEOs don't always see eye to eye on their role in society.


  “Our position is that we should enable as much expression as possible unless it will cause imminent risk of specific harms or dangers spelled out in clear policies," Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a post on his social network Friday.

“I think it's important to be out here to show this kind of protest is all right and spread the word,” said the 21-year-old Bermudez, who added he's a part-time student at Porterville College and a seasonal worker.


  Bermudez was at the corner of Centennial Park holding with another protestor an American flag with “Black Lives Matter” printed on it.


  “The situation needs changing. Everything is not OK. It's important we get our voice. It doesn't get any more complicated than that.


  “It's important to show that the small towns like here in Porterville — everybody has their voices, their causes.”


  When asked if it was important that the protest be peaceful, Bermudez said, “Of course. Any intention of destruction or rioting is separate from what we're doing here today.”


  Bermudez said Porterville Police officers did tell the protestors “that they're here to protect us” and that they were there to manage the situation and “to make sure everybody is OK at the end of the day. That it's a peaceful protest.”


  Bermudez said protests like the one on Saturday are important because “everybody needs to speak up and become part of the process.”

The Coyles were ready to get out of Illinois, but they had agreed they would wait until after their sons graduated from high school.


  “After they graduated, we sold the practice,” said Coyle. “Basically within 45 days, we sold the practice and the house and we were on the road. We were jobless and homeless.”


  They began cruising around doing job interviews and seeing the country when, out of the blue, Dr. Allen Stout called them and invited them to Bullhead City for an interview. A couple of weeks later while preparing for an interview in Portland, Oregon, the devoutly religious couple had a spiritual moment.


  “We went to this little sandwich shop in downtown Portland before the interview,” said Rose. “I get up and I had a spiritual experience. We had been doing a lot of praying on this. I came out and told Terry there’s no reason to do this interview. We need to call Dr. Stout, we need to go pack our hotel room and cancel the other appointments you have scheduled. And go back to Bullhead. That’s what we did.”


  Coyle’s focus is now non-narcotic interventional pain management. “It’s pain medicine minus the narcotics,” said Coyle.


  He can treat patients with joint injections, epidurals, PRP injections and traditional chiropractic methods.


  “It’s just a wonderful combination,” said Coyle. “Medicine is not the cure all. The medicine allows your brain to either not feel it or react to it so that you can fix the problem. The only way to fix the problem is to physically fix the problem.”


  Coyle also specializes in Video Fluroscopy, Carpal Tunnel treament and Hyalgan knee injections.


  The Coyles are very active in the community, including the Kiwanis Club of the Colorado River, the Bullhead Area Chamber of Commerce and with the Caring Hearts Food Ministry at Amazing Grace Fellowship Church.


  “Dr. Coyle is here to stay,” added Rose. “He’s not looking for an out plan. He has put down roots and is part of the community.”

By the time this issue of the paper goes into print, it’ll be just about a week away from my birthday. The one time of year that feels like a day dedicated to just me and I get to spend it with my family and friends.


  This year uncertainty surrounds June 4th because for the first time in my life I’m not sure what kind of celebration I’m going to have. Everything is very much up in the air besides the fact that I’m hitting my mid thirties, that part is very certain.


  But I’d be lying if I said the past three and a half decades haven’t been a blessing. I’ve had my fair share of ups and there’s been a lot of times where I’ve been way down. There’s been people come into my life as friends that I didn’t ever expect to be there. There’s also been a lot of people I expected to be there for me that pulled a magic act and vanished.


  But to be able to live the life that I’ve had, it’s a blessing in itself. Most of my life hasn’t been perfect, but there’s been blessings in disguise in just about every part of it. I didn’t see it then because I was being short- sighted, but looking back on things I see how many times things could have been worse but ended up not as bad as I thought it would be.


  I’m bad for worrying about things. I think that’s why at 35 years old, I have my fair share of gray hair in my beard. I could lie and say they’re for wisdom, but let’s be honest here, I’m a worry-wart. Most of the time the things that I stress myself out over don’t even come to fruition, but that doesn’t stop me from obsessing over the outcomes.


  I think that’s one thing I’m going to try to stop doing as I get older is worry so much. I need to just relax and take things one day at a time instead of keeping myself torn to pieces all the time. Sometimes, when you’re in that negative mindset you worry and don’t even realize you are because it comes so natural to you.


  Another thing that I want to do is just slow down a little. I’m not talking about driving, but more along the lines of taking time to smell the roses. There’s a lot of things that keep us busy. It can be our job, someone we’re dating, ball games, movies, even facebook. You can make yourself feel busy and do absolutely nothing. One thing I want to do as I grow older is spend more time with the right people in my life. There’s a lot of people I think of quite often in my mind that I haven’t heard from in awhile. Most of the time, I think about sending them a message letting them know I miss hanging out but I delete it and never send it.


  When I grew up, my circle of friends was very tight. We had our own little group and we stuck together really tight. It wasn’t a day or two at most that we didn’t call each other and talk & laugh about everything. But I notice, the older I get the more that circle of friendship widens. There’s people I’d consider a friend right now that I haven’t spoke to in years. I think I’ll make it a goal the rest of this crazy 2020 to try to get back in touch with people that have slipped away and try to spend a little time together when all this virus stuff is safe again.


  I watch Andy Griffith every night at home now, I have most of the seasons on DVD because I think it’s the best tv show ever by far. But on a episode the other night I was watching, Andy & Barney were just sitting on the porch after eating one of Aunt Bee’s famous suppers. They weren’t doing nothing extraordinary, just sitting there talking. Andy was peeling a apple with his old knife and Barney was just sitting there in his salt and pepper suit with his feet propped up on the porch. It made me think just how long it’d been since I’d done that with a friend, it’d been awhile. It’d been awhile since I’d had a friend over period, but it made me miss those times. Sitting out on a cool summer night somewhere just talking about the latest gossip and spending time together. I miss those times so bad the older I get. I need a night like that really bad really soon!


  But as I digress, I want to thank God for almost 35 years of a wonderful life that I’ve been fortunate enough to live. For my friends, my family, my church and my health. I hope I’ve got 35 more left in me! What a ride it’s been! Whether I have a huge party or a small get together, I’ll feel like a lucky man!

These upheavals seem to occur only in Democrat-run cities:  Ferguson, Baltimore, New York, Los Angeles.   It is easy to see why after seeing the mayor of Minneapolis called back the police and National Guard giving the vandals free rein to destroy his city.  His concern was that they be masked so as not to spread the virus!  The leadership of Baltimore did the same in 2015; "Let them have their space"  said then-Mayor Stephanie Rawlings.  The riots in Ferguson in 2014 were exacerbated by President Obama and Eric Holder, who, as was their habit, immediately blamed the police which had the effect of giving permission to angry citizens to act out in the most destructive ways.  Rioters in that city also burned the businesses owned and operated by their neighbors. They burned the markets they regularly patronized.  The rent-a-mobs get the action going and the suddenly mindless residents join in to destroy their own community.

Five days later, Senator Robert F. Wagner, a Democrat, and Senator Robert Taft Jr., a Conservative Republican from Ohio, introduced an identical resolution to the Senate.  Although the sniping between both political parties had gone on since the creation of the Republican Party, on this issue, evidenced by their respective platforms in 1948, bipartisan support for the emergent state of Israel was unshakable.

“A lot of (smaller movies) are already going that route, and they’ve made it work because their budgets tend to be smaller anyway,” Koplinski said.


  Derek Long, a film historian at the University of Illinois, agreed that the pandemic would likely cause an “intensification” of trends already underway.


  “There will probably be major changes, whether it’s to the theatrical experience or certainly to the types of films you see in theaters,” he said. “But those changes have already been underway.”


  He expects more “low-risk franchise films,” with more sophisticated films more likely to be streamed.


  While he believes there’s still a “desire to have that experience in the theater even beyond blockbusters,” he fears that could be increasingly hard to come by when not in major markets.


  Champaign-Urbana’s Art Theater met that fate before COVID-19, when it closed abrupty in October and the Art Film Foundation filed for bankruptcy.


  David Kraft, who owns the property at 126-128 W. Church St., put it up for sale earlier this year, but has yet to find a buyer.


  “No update,” he said. “Hopefully things will get back to normal soon, and any interested parties will come forward. It is a great location and the community deserves for it to be open.”


  Long said theaters, especially smaller ones, will likely try to open as soon as states allow them to.


  “They can’t really afford to be closed for much longer,” he said.Once they do, they could be further hurt if customers are wary of buying concessions, as theaters make most of their money on that.


  “They might not be spending the extra money, either because of their circumstances and they have less disposable income, or because they might be afraid of contamination in the popcorn,” Long said.


  The theater closures have pushed back the opening dates for many movies Koplinski was planning to review.


  “We should be watching ‘Fast and Furious 9’ this weekend, but that was pushed back till next year,” he said. “Everything’s been shifted on down the line.”


  While he’s not thrilled about theaters’ prospects, he said the success of drive-in theaters, like the Harvest Moon Twin Drive-in in Gibson City, “indicates to me that people want to go back.”

“The results of the survey show that many young technology companies are facing bankruptcy, and the industry is not receiving sufficient assistance from the Israeli government. The additional support approved for high-tech companies, valued at NIS 1.2 billion, is not sufficient and is not based on a thoughtful and methodical response. The innovation industry is the main growth engine of the economy, and has been carrying the Israeli economy on its back towards unprecedented growth and prosperity, almost without any government support,” Karin Meir Rubenstein, CEO and President of IATI, said in a statement. “In light of the figures we have, the government must provide a response to the immediate needs that came up in the survey, and provide financial solutions that will allow the industry to continue to exist.

Lionel Messi ha mostrado su lado más sensible al referirse a los efectos que dejará en nuestras vidas la pandemia del coronavirus. Para el futbolista argentino es una lástima lo que ocurre en el mundo y apunta que el fútbol, como la vida, no volverá ser igual a causa del COVID-19. “A casi todos nos queda la duda de cómo va a ser el mundo tras todo lo que ocurrió. Más allá del confinamiento y de la situación que nos agarró por sorpresa, muchísima gente lo pasó realmente mal porque les afectó esta situación de alguna manera, como ocurrió con todos aquellos que perdieron a sus familiares y amigos y ni tan siquiera pudieron casi ni despedirlos”, dijo Messi en El País Semanal. “Creo que hubo muchas cosas negativas en esta crisis, pero no puede haber nada peor que perder a las personas que más querés, eso me crea una frustración enorme y me parece lo más injusto de todo”, agregó el capitán del Fútbol Club Barcelona. Más allá del fútbol, Lionel Messi confiesa sentir penal y frustración por aquellas personas que, afectadas por el coronavirus, no pudieron despedirse por última vez de sus seres queridos. “El fútbol, como la vida en general, pienso que no volverá a ser igual. Todos los que hemos vivido esta situación recordaremos lo que ocurrió de una u otra manera. En mi caso, con un sentimiento de pena y frustración para con aquellos que sufrieron más por la pérdida de sus seres queridos.

Y en la parte del desempeño profesional porque la vuelta a los entrenamientos, a las competiciones y a lo que antes se hacía de una manera normal, ahora se va a tener que implantar de nuevo, pero de manera progresiva. Será una situación extraña para nosotros los deportistas y para cualquiera que tenga que cambiar sus dinámicas habituales de trabajo”, agregó.

Plays, concerts and other productions have been shut down across the country and around the world since the pandemic, but area theaters have found ways to keep fans interested.


  Trinity Bird, executive director at The Sauk in Jonesville, said there is currently no reopening schedule at The Sauk, but the theater has found ways to connect virtually while shifting production plans.


  "We have made the choice to move our productions of "Tony N' Tina's Wedding" and "The Sound of Music" to our 2021 season," Bird said. "We are still planning to present the remainder of our 2020 season as currently scheduled, although that could change as well."


  Nevertheless, Bird is proud to say that since The Sauk closed the doors on March 13, they have created new theatre every week but two. The 17 Living Room Monologues and the four Plays-in-Development can all be found on the website at www.thesauk.org.


  "We also have two shows in rehearsal, Sauk Shorts and Weekend Comedy," Bird said. "We are exploring a number of options to continue presenting theatre. These include, but are not limited to, performing outside, performing to limited audience numbers in the theatre, streaming the shows live online and offering a streaming video version of productions."


  Bird said the theater has had some successful online fundraising and they were waiting to hear about the MCACA Emergency grants being announced soon.


  "We continue to feel the love and support of our community and that means the world," Bird said.


  Erik Gable, Director of Marketing and Audience Development at The Croswell in Adrian, said they were forced to cancel all shows from mid-March through the end of July.


  "As of right now, we are proceeding with plans to produce a show in August, but we know that things may change," Gable said. "One particular challenge for us is that, as a producing theater, we can't just be closed one day and open the next. Every show we produce takes at least three months to get from auditions to opening night, and it has to be safe for people to be in the theater rehearsing for much of that time."


  While the theater has been shut down, they have been engaging people in a number of ways.


  "We have started a Facebook group called 'The Great Big Long-Distance Croswell Show' where community members are invited to share videos of themselves performing in their own homes," Gable said. "We have also started a program called Streaming Sundays, in which shows from our archives are shown on our Facebook page every Sunday at 7 p.m."


  To watch, go to the Croswell's Facebook page at fb.com/thecroswell.


  Moving forward, The Croswell anticipates that when the theater is able to start producing shows again, there will be some restrictions.


  "We may need to limit our seating capacity to allow more physical distance between patrons, and although we already cleaned the theater before every performance, we expect that our cleaning regimen will be intensified," he said. "We're eager to get back to doing what we love, but the safety of our cast members, volunteers and guests will always be our top priority."


  At the Tibbits Opera House and Theatre in Coldwater, Executive Director Christine Delaney said


  with the tagline "Conquering Covid One Show at a Time," Tibbits is forging ahead with a new professional summer theatre season, keeping the safety of all in mind while becoming one of the few theatres to produce a live summer theatre season.


  Delaney said theatre staff has had to reevaluate everything about the season in light of the executive order and current environment.


  "Tibbits will now offer seven shows starting in July, presented as fully- staged reader's theatre and concert-style performances with small casts," Delaney said. "While the new season still includes 'Man of La Mancha' and 'Love Letters' from the original plan, it now also offers a variety of plays and music that will change almost weekly. A very small company featuring many Tibbits favorites will demonstrate their professional versatility and put the season emphasis on the performances rather than sets and costumes."


  Tibbits staff is in the process of reaching out to all who have tickets for the season or individual shows. Once those ticket changes have been accommodated, tickets will go on sale at Tibbits.org for all shows. Seating will reflect social distancing recommendations. Prices range from $10-$25 with discounts for students, groups, and Tibbits members.

Joe Burrow can teach the NFL a thing or two.


   


  The rest of America, too.


   


  Unlike most prominent white male athletes, who have stayed largely silent about the racism and systemic oppression of people of color in this country, the No. 1 pick in last month's NFL draft addressed it head on. At his own initiative.


   


  "The black community needs our help. They have been unheard for far too long," Burrow said in a Twitter post Friday. "Open your ears, listen, and speak. This isn't politics. This is human rights."


   


  The outrage over the death of George Floyd, who died Monday after a white police officer held his knee on Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes, seems like a sea change. Perhaps it's the sheer brutality of the video of Floyd's death, with Derek Chauvin appearing calm and impassive to Floyd's cries that he can't breathe until his body goes limp. Or maybe it's exhaustion from the unending bigotry of President Donald Trump, who has emboldened racists and white nationalists to say the quiet things out loud.


   


  Whatever it is, the rage and protests roiling the country feel different. Burrow's heartfelt post, as well as similar statements by Clemson quarterback Trevor Lawrence and the Eagles' Carson Wentz and Zach Ertz, capture that shift.


   


  "It's very rare to see a white athlete say something to this magnitude," said Louis Moore, an associate professor of history at Grand Valley State and author of "We Will Win the Day: The Civil Rights Movement, the Black Athlete and the Quest for Equality."


   


  "It's important because it's so different," he added. "But it's also a call to action. And if they pull through, if they actually do something about it, it can change the tide."


   


  When Colin Kaepernick began taking a knee almost four years ago in protest of police brutality against people of color and the racism at the root of it, he was joined by dozens of other players. But with few exceptions - very few exceptions - those players were also people of color.


   


  Sure, there were white players who expressed support for their teammates. Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers went so far as to say Kaepernick was being blackballed from the league. But very few white NFL players - and none with the profile and sway to change public opinion - were willing to initiate the conversation or take a visible stand.


   


  The message was that this was a problem for black and brown players. It was their communities that were affected. They were the ones who knew the pain and humiliation of being judged by the color of their skin.


   


  "That's just how the movement has always been," Moore said.


   


  Whether that's out of privilege, ignorance or fear of saying the wrong thing, I don't know. What I do know is that people of color did not create this structure that is rooted in racism, and they cannot be expected to fix it. Not on their own, at least.


   


  White people have to speak up and call for change, too. Particularly those who have a platform.


   


  Like, say, an NFL quarterback.


   


  Sad as it is to say, the letter from the Players Coalition asking for a federal investigation into the death of Ahmaud Arbery, who was chased down and killed by two white men while he was jogging, probably would have gone largely unnoticed had it not been for one name on it.


   


  Tom Brady.


   


  Brady avoids anything that could be considered even slightly controversial like he does strawberries. So for the six-time Super Bowl champion to add his name to the call for justice was significant. If you're a fan of the New England Patriots or Tampa Bay Buccaneers, or just Brady in general, and you've never much thought about inequality, or you disapproved of Kaepernick, maybe you reconsider the way you think now.


   


  If you're a Clemson fan, maybe you pause and think about your own implicit biases after reading Lawrence's posts.


   


  "There has to be a shift in the way of thinking," Lawrence said Friday on Twitter. "I'm siding with my brothers that deal, and continuously deal, with things I will never experience. The injustice is clear ... and so is the hate. It can no longer be explained away. If you're still 'explaining' it - check your heart and ask why."


   


  And if you're a black or brown player who has stayed quiet, knowing what happened to Kaepernick, maybe you feel emboldened to speak up, knowing your quarterback has your back.


   


  "Being from North Dakota, I've spent a large part of my life surrounded by people of similar color, so I'm never gonna act like I know what the black community goes through or even has gone through already," Wentz said Thursday night. "I'll never know the feeling of having to worry about my kids going outside because of their skin color.


   


  "However, I do know that we are all equal at the foot of the cross and Jesus taught us to value others' lives like they were our own - regardless of skin tone."


   


  Systemic racism is not a black or brown problem. It's a problem, period, one we all need to work to fix. It's nice to see high-profile, white male athletes finally joining in the fight.

COVID-19 has put a damper on almost everything. Several concert tours have either been canceled or postponed. Even new music and album releases have been hampered.      By this point most years, I'm putting together a column predicting what the songs of summer will be. I don't see the point of doing that now. Nothing "feels" like summer, nor does there seem to be a surge from the music industry to push songs.      I understand it, but that doesn't mean I have to be happy about it. I can say this, though: If you're a true artist, you're finding ways to weather this current situation.      I'm loving all the internet videos from artists on YouTube, Facebook Live and other outlets. It is a way for them to keep in touch and entertain the masses. It doesn't compare to a live show, but it's music.      Several artists have canceled tours, including the much-hyped pairing of Bon Jovi and Bryan Adams. Elton John scrapped his "Farewell" tour for another year and I recently learned Janet Jackson's "Black Diamond" tour has been postponed. I was looking forward to seeing her perform again.      Taylor Swift also canceled her tour. This was a big deal, considering the tour was to support her latest hit album, "Lover," her first LP since her highly publicized departure from Big Machine Records. Swift left the label so she could have more say and rights to her own music. Matters turned even uglier when it was later made known that Swift's nemesis, Scooter Braun, had purchased her catalog when he joined her former label. Braun owns the rights to the music from Swift's first six albums.      Swift's canceled tour is a major bummer for her and her fans. But that hasn't stopped the singer. First, she performed on the televised "One World" concert for COVID-19 relief for front-line workers. Then, ABC gave her a prime spot following the "American Idol" season finale, airing a special one-hour performance, taped last fall in Paris, of Swift performing music from "Lover."      Last weekend, Swift may have done what her diehard fans wanted her to do the most. She tweeted her love for the cover of her song "Look What You Made Me Do" heard in an episode of "Killing Eve." The song was credited to a fictional band called Jack Leopards & The Dolphin Club. Boom!      This was a huge move. At one time, Swift's brother Austin went by The Dolphin Club on social media. The song was produced by Nils Sjoberg, which was a pseudonym Swift used on a track she produced with Calvin Harris. The last part of this plan was Swift asked "Killing Eve" executive producers to have her brother featured on the show's soundtrack.      If you haven't heard the track, check it out. It's stellar and has a different feel to it than it did before. If this is, indeed, Austin, then the world had better make room for another Swift.   Sorry, Scooter - Look what you made Taylor Swift do.   David T. Farr can be reached at farrboy@hotmail.com.

It wouldn't be surprising to see the Eagles rattle off at least three victories inside the division. A split with the Giants is likely, and a sweep of the Redskins is very possible. On paper, the Cowboys are much more talented, and the Eagles might take a goose egg against them, which would be the difference for first place in the competitive NFC East.
