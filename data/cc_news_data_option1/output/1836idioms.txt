Who are the people today who run the largest data networks? It’s Amazon, Facebook, Google and everybody else. They have a tremendous amount of expertise in running data networks. My personal point of view is that at some point it makes sense to synergise what we call our voice networks and data networks because when data flows, these artificial distinctions increasingly become obsolete and sometimes a hindrance. Look at present networks. You need a translation mechanism for IP versus voice in networks, and then retranslated at the end. There are friction points, and as we go forward, I think that this unlocks more value for our operators in the long term.

_Napoli, 08 mag 17:30 - (Agenzia Nova)_ \- "Nell'illustrare le ragioni per cui i cittadini della Campania dovrebbero evitare di recarsi negli ospedali del Nord perché da noi, a suo avviso, l'assistenza sarebbe la migliore in Italia, De Luca ha omesso alcuni interessanti primati inanellati in questi ultimi cinque anni". Così la capogruppo regionale del Movimento 5 stelle in Campania Valeria Ciarambino. "A partire dai tempi ancora biblici delle liste d'attesa - ha proseguito - Basti ricordare che per una mammografia si aspetta anche un intero anno, mentre per interventi urologici e oculistici l'attesa sale fino a tre anni, per non parlare della chirurgia oncologica. A scorrere i dati Agenas, si scopre che primi in Italia lo siamo anche per morti da ictus, mortalità tumorale, per mortalità materna e per morti evitabili. E laddove ci ritroviamo ultimi, in questo caso in Europa, lo siamo per aspettativa di vita. L'unico vanto della sanità campana sono la straordinarie eccellenze che vi lavorano, purtroppo mortificate da una politica che premia l'appartenenza politica a scapito del merito e della professionalità. Interessante il passaggio in cui il comiziante del venerdì ha dichiarato che i test rapidi sono del tutto inaffidabili. Ci spiegasse allora perché, nonostante fossero stati sconsigliati da ministero e Oms, li ha comprati e, soprattutto, per quali ragioni i dirigenti delle sue Asl hanno sottoposto a test rapidi pazienti sintomatici che hanno dati esiti falsamente negativi e che nel frattempo hanno trasformato l'ospedale di Pozzuoli e Villa Mercede a Ischia in autentici lazzaretti, diffondendo il contagio tra sanitari, pazienti e anziani che hanno perso la vita", ha concluso Ciarambino.

Alabama's dine-in restaurants, bars, salons and gyms prepped to reopen Monday as the state eases restrictions during the continuing coronavirus pandemic.
 The state is lifting restrictions on nonwork gatherings of 10 or more people beginning Monday. Businesses including restaurants, hair salons, bars, breweries and gymnasiums can reopen with rules including increased cleaning, crowd limits and, in some cases, the use of face masks.
 Christy DellÁria, the owner of In the Loop Hair Studio in Montgomery, Alabama, said she was looking forward to reopening, but said some clients had already been driving to Georgia where salons opened sooner.

A Pueblo West banker with a heart of gold is the "biggest cheerleader" for volunteer organizations with which she works. And it.s the littlest residents who motivate her.
   
 Terry Baughman, a vice president for the Bank of the San Juans, said when she started her career in banking 35 years ago, "it was suggested you get out in the community and volunteer," she said.
   
 "I am a native of Pueblo and moved to Pueblo West in 1995. I love this town and I love volunteering; I am very extroverted," Baughman said.
   
 Due to recent COVID-19 stay at home and safer at home orders, she said she has felt "very lost without all the events I am used to, but I am very lucky because I am still working."
   
 As a mother of three grown boys and grandmother to seven (an eighth grandchild is due in September), she admits to having "such a love for the little ones."
   
 In February, she became president of the Pueblo Child Advocacy Center, which serves young victims of abuse. She signed up last year because of a personal experience with victims of sexual abuse.
   
 "That center is an amazing place for the police or sheriff to bring a child in for an interview. They have the ability to do medical exams at the center as well.
   
 That team -- the things they have had and see and have to deal with -- I could not do it. Because of the stay at home order, there has been an increase in cases," she said.
   
 "The numbers are going to kill me when we see what's going on. I wish we didn't need it, but I am so thankful we have this center," Baughman explained.
   
 "I want every little kid to be safe, And if that can't happen, I want a safe place to help them through a very traumatic incident, from the initial intake through the follow-up," she said.
   
 Having considered a career in teaching and deciding against it due to the pay, she instead serves as a teacher through her volunteer work with organizations such as Junior Achievement of Pueblo. It is an organization she has served for three decades and she strives to help children decide what they want to be when they grow up.
   
 "I started with Cheryl Ford's fifth-grade class, and as Junior Achievement has continue to grow, I've done little kids and bigger kids.
   
 "We are teaching things they don't have to time to teach in school like entrepreneurship -- what a business owner does, hiring employees, payroll -- or how to behave during a job interview," she explained.
   
 Her favorite exercise was a role play she did with a teacher. The teacher took on the role of the boss.
   
 "I was the poor interviewee ; I was chewing gum and had my phone in my hand," she said with a laugh. "We want to help the kids understand how to be professional."
   
 Baughman also has volunteered with Pueblo Crime Stoppers, the Pueblo Parade of Lights and the Colorado State Fair Parade. She has helped with many chamber events and has been board vice president with the Pueblo West Chamber since last February.
   
 "Just watching the growth in the community, I felt like now is a good time to get involved. I would like nothing more than to see Pueblo West grow and continue to do good things," she said.
   
 Working with small business owners during the virus outbreak has been sobering.
   
 Some business owners have told her, "I don't know if we are going to survive. There are so many small businesses that are not going to be able to reopen," she said.
   
 Pueblo West Chamber Director Amy Gasperetti is working full steam ahead with the board to support businesses here, Baughman said. Some of the stimulus money will help, but "its not going to be a save-all. It is going to be work for those willing to step up to help these businesses," Baughman said.
   
 Her efforts are appreciated by Gasperetti.
   
 "Terry has been a tremendous asset to our board of directors at the Pueblo West Chamber. I've heard people she works with call her their 'biggest cheerleader' and that describes her well," Gasperetti said.
   
 "She is full of energy; always positive, supportive and seeking solutions. She jumps in to help whenever and however she can and often brings more people with her.
   
 "She's the best kind of board member and I'm grateful to have the opportunity to know this amazing woman," Gasperetti said.
   
 "I just have a passion for things I really feel are important. I don't know if I will ever be able to slow down," Baughman said.

USC was Simon's first offer late in his freshman year heading into his sophomore year. That has always carried significance for him, even as he went through something of a lull in communication with the program after the offseason coaching changes on the defensive side.


  "First offer. It was a blessing. It was kind of surreal, it was kind of crazy getting an offer from USC. Being my first, I was so happy," he told TrojanSports.com back in February.


  "I can't appreciate them enough for that because recruiting kind of took off just from that. I appreciate the opportunity they gave me being the first ones. I always show them love for that."


  His lead recruiter back then was Johnny Nansen, who was let go after last season. Eventually, though, new cornerbacks coach and ace recruiter Donte Williams picked up that role and he, defensive coordinator Todd Orlando and defensive graduate assistant Michael Hutchings all helped close the deal with Simon.


  "Just the relationships I have with them, it was top-notch," Simon said Sunday during his announcement. "They're kind of a newer staff, but I feel like they really trust and believe in me. It was more about me as a person because the football thing is going to take care of itself if you work hard at it, and they really tried to recruit me as a person and that's one thing I'll say set them apart."


  At Lincoln HS, Simon had 32 tackles, 4 interceptions, 2 sacks and 2 tackles for loss, but he also made a major impact on the offensive side, catching 83 passes for 1,033 yards and 12 touchdowns and rushing for 138 yards and 7 TDs.  


  He'll make his impact on the defensive side for the Trojans, though, and so far that new defensive staff is putting a nice stamp on this recruiting class. Overall, USC has landed eight commitments since March 11.


  The class so far now includes Simon, Davis, Garcia, Gaoteote, Beavers, Campbell, 4-star DT Jay Toia, 4-star safety Calen Bullock, 3-star safety Xamarion Gordon, 3-star OG Maximus Gibbs, and 3-star OT Mason Murphy.


  And the buzz is that more commits are on the way. For more about that and what we're hearing, check out the latest intel on our Trojan Talk message board.

Clopidogrel has remained, ever since its first approval in 1997, the antiplatelet therapy of choice among physicians for the treatment of patients with conditions such as acute coronary syndrome or percutaneous coronary intervention. The drug was the first thienopyridine to hit the market, which gave it an excellent head start over a number of drugs for these conditions that are either available in the market or are in clinical trials. As a result, the drug did not face much competition and has taken over the global market, with its array of application constantly expanding.

China reported 14 new cases Sunday, its first double-digit rise in 10 days. Eleven of 12 domestic infections were in the northeastern province of Jilin, prompting authorities to raise the threat level in one of its counties, Shulan, to high risk, just days after downgrading all regions to low risk.
 Authorities said the Shulan outbreak originated with a 45-year-old woman who had no recent travel or exposure history but spread it to her husband, three sisters and other relatives. Train services in the county were suspended.
 "Epidemic control and prevention is a serious and complicated matter, and local authorities should never be overly optimistic, war-weary or off-guard," said Jilin Communist Party secretary Bayin Chaolu.
 Jilin also shares a border with North Korea, which insists it has no virus cases, much to the disbelief of international health authorities.
 South Korea reported 34 more cases as new infections linked to nightclubs threaten its hard-won gains against the virus. It was the first time that South Korea's daily infections were above 30 in about a month.
 The U.S. has seen 1.3 million infections and nearly 80,000 deaths — the most in the world by far, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University.
 Many families celebrated Mother's Day weekend from afar, delaying or changing their normal plans. A nursing home in Miami held a Mother's Day parade on Saturday, with children and grandchildren driving past the windows and waving at loved ones inside. Others grieved for those victims of the virus that has caused particular suffering for the elderly and previously sick.
 Matilda Cuomo, the mother of New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, called into her son's daily briefing so he and his three daughters could wish her a happy Mother's Day.
 "I am so blessed as many mothers today are," she said.
 Andrew Cuomo, whose state is the deadliest hot spot for the virus in the U.S., said he looked forward to getting back to normal. "We're going to have fun, and then you can spend more time with me. I know I am your favorite," he said in a playful dig at his siblings.
 Cuomo also announced two policy reversals a day after an Associated Press report in which residents' relatives, watchdog groups and politicians from both parties alleged he was not doing enough to counter the surge of deaths in nursing homes, where about 5,300 residents have died. Nursing home staff in New York will now have to undergo COVID-19 tests twice a week and facilities will no longer be required to take in hospital patients who were infected.
 Three members of the White House coronavirus task force, including Dr. Anthony Fauci, placed themselves in quarantine after coming in contact with someone who tested positive.
 Worldwide, 4 million people have been reported infected and more than 280,000 have died, over half of them in Europe, according to Johns Hopkins.
