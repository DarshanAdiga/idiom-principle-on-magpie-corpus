I've never read such a bunch of self entitled tripe in my life. This woman is a danger to society and should be removed from it. She has no regard for anyone but herself, not even her children. This claim that her children needed to see their father sounds totally empty to me. She had five years to connect her kids with their father, either he didn't care or she didn't. In fact the authorities should be examining her fitness as a mother and look at removing her kids from her. I hope the authorities throw the book at her and deny her legal aid. She hasn't contributed a thing toward our economy in the last 5 years, but she'll put her hand out and think she is entitled to assistance. Time to get tough on these morons.

There was shame and guilt attached to that decision, he said, and it was important to May, who had heard a quote from Tigers outfielder Cameron Maybin about looking for allies, to show that he was one. May aimed to do that Friday night when he knelt during the the national anthem.
 “That was my way of saying, ‘I’m here. I’m at your disposal. I recognize your suffering and the things that I’ll never have context for, no matter how much I try. But I’m going to just continue trying,’ ” May said. “I want to get to a point where in this country, we feel like the people directly affected by this system and these policies, they feel like they don’t need to kneel anymore. I think I have a role to play in that. I think that everyone has a role to play in that.”
 May, along with teammates Byron Buxton, LaMonte Wade Jr., Aaron Whitefield, Taylor Rogers, Sergio Romo and Tyler Duffey, and manager Rocco Baldelli and coaches Mike Bell and Tommy Watkins knelt on Friday.
 More and more conversations have sprung up within the clubhouse about racial inequalities in the United States, and they’re conversations that May welcomes. He said the fact that everyone is thinking and listening is step one and has been an encouraging and hopeful sign to him.

Seattle City Council President M. Lorena González said Robart appeared focused on maintaining the “integrity of the city’s commitment to the consent decree,” not on the legality of the weapons ban itself. Yet the decision risked escalating tensions during the weekend’s protests, she said.
 “I am nervous that allowing the Police Department to use this tool effectively guarantees that they will use it,” González said. “And that is going to be in combination with the federal agents who are in town.”
 Best said in a statement that police officers would carry pepper spray and blast balls during protests planned for Saturday. "SPD promises the community that we will not deploy CS [tear] gas," Best said.
 Best had repeatedly voiced strong opposition to the ban, saying it would endanger officers and leave them with only "riot shields and riot batons."
 Tear gas and pepper spray are different substances but can have similar effects, like pain in the eyes, nose and throat. During protests in June, Best and Mayor Jenny Durkan announced that Seattle police officers would stop using tear gas for 30 days, but several days later police used tear gas.
 Mayor Jenny Durkan's office said Saturday the council bill “could conflict with the requirements under the consent decree” and Robart's ruling will allow for more review by police oversight bodies.

Noting the legacy of slavery continues to disadvantage African Americans, the motion called on the Board to declare that racism is a matter of public health and to prioritize its elimination from County policies, practices, operations and programs.   The motion also called for making legislative, policy and programmatic changes to prioritize physical and mental health, housing, employment, public safety and justice in an equitable way for African Americans. Finally, it calls for tracking progress by reporting annually on the State of Black Los Angeles County.
