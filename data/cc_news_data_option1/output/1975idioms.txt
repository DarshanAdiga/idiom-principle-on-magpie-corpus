 A day earlier, the U.S. Justice Department warned Newsom that the restrictions he imposed and his plans to scale them back could infringe on religious groups’ constitutional freedoms.
 Eric S. Dreiband, an assistant attorney general and the head of the Justice Department’s civil rights division, questioned Newsom’s decision to keep houses of worship closed until the third phase of the state’s reopening plan while allowing restaurants, offices, shopping malls and schools to open in the second.
 Dreiband cited a statement from Atty. Gen. William Barr that religious institutions “must not be singled out for special burdens.”

As area high school students prepare to graduate, school systems are trying to come up with strategies that will honor their achievements in this most difficult of times while still maintaining social distancing.
 Stoughton has come up with a "hybrid model," which also is being employed by Randolph in a unique way. Others are in various stages of development at this time.
 Randolph
 The Randolph Public Schools released a letter on May 8 which detailed a similar strategy for graduation. Like Stoughton, the administration decided to keep the original graduation date - which is June 6 for Randolph High School. There will be a prerecorded musical playing and singing of the "Star Spangled Banner," reading of speeches and announcement of the graduates' names at 10:30 a.m. This will be shared with the entire Randolph Public Schools community.
 At 1 p.m., a parade for the graduates will commence, led by a decorated school bus, fire engines and police cars, and possibly motorcycles. At staggered times, the graduates and their families will proceed in their cars up North Main Street from the Higashi Center, to Memorial Parkway and Randolph High School. Cars will line up by group in a first-come, first-served basis.
 Students will give an index card with their names to a staff member, then be directed to line up 10 feet behind the previous student. Once the student's name is called, the diploma will be placed on a table. The family's car will be allowed to go to the main entrance to view the event. The student will turn the cap's tassel from right to left and be declared a graduate. A photographer will take one picture.
 School Committee Chair Andrea Nixon spoke of her pride for the class and the work the School Department and community have put forward to make this event a reality in a statement.
 "As the Class of 2020 prepares to celebrate their graduation in a non- traditional manner, the Randolph School community would like to congratulate them on all their success and accomplishments," she said. "Since the pandemic started the District staff and community have been working together to ensure the success of all our graduating students. The District has worked hard to facilitate on-line learning to ensure our graduates meet the new requirements for graduation."
 She added that Town Councilor Christos Alexopoulos worked with the PTO in distributing lawn signs throughout town as a display of tribute to the graduates.
 "The RHS PTO has worked with Town Councilor Christos Alexopoulos, the District and community volunteers to publicly acknowledge graduates with lawn signs showing how much we LOVE our RHS graduating class. What the current events have shown me is that even in the face of uncertainty - we are One Randolph. While graduates are not able to walk across that stage at graduation, with their parents, family and community looking on in a traditional way, please know that we are celebrating with you and are so very proud of you. Congratulations Class of 2020!"
 Stoughton
 Stoughton School Superintendent John Marcus unveiled the high school's plans to honor the graduating class in a two-part graduation ceremony on Thursday, June 4.
 After weeks of planning with community stakeholders and surveying plans of other districts both locally and nationwide, Marcus said officials agreed on a graduation ceremony on the original date rather than on postponing it until the summer.
 "We worked hard together as a team to make this happen," he said. "It's been a physically and emotionally difficult experience for this class. We want to make sure we keep the occasion safe and one that they will remember."
 The plan takes into consideration the fact that gatherings of large crowds may not be possible for weeks or months. Also, many students may be going on family vacations or heading to college and would not be able to participate in a late-summer ceremony.
 ""It's a wonderful plan developed with a number of voices giving feedback," including said the Student Council, School Committee, parents and local officials, Marcus said.
 He called it a "hybrid model," with some ceremonies taking place online and some in a public, socially distant way.
 "We want to give the students all the recognition they deserve and an online experience everyone can enjoy," Marcus said. "The second part will be as close to in person and live as we can get it while keeping socially distant and safe. I'm really excited about it."
 There will be a prerecorded portion of the graduation ceremony that will be shared with the entire Stoughton Public Schools community at 10 a.m. June 4. This presentation will include the Pledge of Allegiance, award announcements and graduation speeches. Also, seniors will be able to include videos of themselves in their caps and gowns with messages of thanks or their future plans.
 At 3 p.m., the graduates will proceed in a car caravan in a drive-up style graduation ceremony. At staggered times, they will arrive at the Stoughton High School campus. Students will exit their vehicles one at a time and proceed to the bus entrance, where they will stand on a red carpet.
 Each student will walk across a stage and receive the diploma from Principal Juliette Miller and Marcus. Then, as the grad turns the cap's tassel from right to left, each will graduate and turn a page in a tumultuous but triumphant chapter in their life history.
 Each graduate will be adorned with an orange stole to commemorate the occasion, Marcus noted.
 "The stole was Principal Miller's idea and had been planned all along," Marcus said. "This is the first class to graduate in the new building, so we wanted to commemorate this historic moment. Miss Miller really cares about these kids and wanted to do something special for them."
 This year, the caps and gowns will be given to students to free, due to a diversion of school budget funding, Marcus said.
 "We knew it was going to be tricky, but we were able to shift money from items we would normally have to purchase but didn't because of the school closing and use it to provide free caps and gowns to students," he said.
 Teachers and staff members plan to be along the bus lane, Middle School parking lot and Cushing Street to celebrate the graduates' accomplishments.
 "Everyone wants to send the students off the best way possible," Marcus said. "I sat in on a faculty meeting today, and (the) overall theme is to keep connected to the students however we can."  
 Holbrook
 Holbrook Middle-High School Laura J. Stevenson said she was "unable to be interviewed regarding our graduation plans at this time" in an email dated May 12.No other plans have been released.
 Canton
 Canton Superintendent Jennifer Fischer-Mueller and Canton High School Principal Derek Folan did not respond to several requests for information regarding the school's plans.

WASHINGTON (AP) — After nearly two months sidelined in Guam with a coronavirus outbreak, the USS Theodore Roosevelt has gone out to sea for training, in preparation to return to duty in the Pacific. The ship has been docked in Guam since March 27, as the 4,800 crew members went through rotations of quarantine, and more than 1,000 of them have tested positive for the virus over that time. “It feels great to be back at sea,” Rear Adm. Stu Baker, commander of Carrier Strike Group 9, said in a statement. “Getting Theodore Roosevelt and Carrier Air Wing 11 one step closer to returning to their mission in the Indo-Pacific is a great achievement for the crew.\" In an Associated Press interview from the aircraft carrier earlier this week, Navy Capt. Carlos Sardiello said the ship will sail with a scaled-back crew of about 3,000, leaving about 1,800 sailors on shore who are still in quarantine or working with those who are. The sailors in quarantine include up to 14 who recently tested positive again for the virus, just days after getting cleared to return to the carrier. The puzzling COVID-19 reappearance in the sailors adds to the difficulty in getting the ship’s crew healthy again, and fuels questions about the quality of the testing and just how long sailors may remain infected or contagious. The ship plans to conduct required carrier qualifications for about two weeks, including recertification of the flight deck and fighter squadron, such as takeoffs and landings on the carrier. The ship will then return to Guam and pick up healthy crew members. If all goes well, it will set out again to conduct operations before eventually heading home to San Diego. The ship has been extensively cleaned, and crew members are taking a wide range of precautions to prevent another outbreak, including social distancing, repeated...

Kevin Harvick scored his 50th win Sunday in NASCAR’s comeback race at Darlington (S.C.) Raceway. It was one of the most historic victories for Harvick in the series, ranking right up there with his very first win in March 2001 at Atlanta Motor Speedway three weeks after Dale Earnhardt’s death. As historic as Sunday’s win was, Harvick wants more, including number 51, which could come in Wednesday night’s Darlington 500k at Darlington. Harvick, driver of the No. 4 Mobil 1 Ford Mustang for Stewart-Haas Racing (SHR), will bring back the same car he won with on Sunday. He dominated the race with 159 laps led and won by 2.154 seconds over Alex Bowman. Wednesday’s race will be a bit different than Sunday’s as it will be only 500 kilometers – 311.4 miles – and will be run at night, as opposed to Sunday’s race that was conducted during the day. Harvick will have the No. 1 pit stall for Wednesday’s race but will start 20th as the top 20 cars invert to create the front half of the grid. But if his pit crew is as good as it was Sunday, Harvick could once again be in contention for the win. He’ll also have Mobil 1 on board as a sponsor and partner. Mobil 1 isn’t just the world’s leading synthetic motor oil brand, it also provides the entire SHR team with leading lubricant technology, ensuring that all SHR Mustangs have a competitive edge over the competition on the track. In its 18th consecutive season as the “Official Motor Oil of NASCAR,” Mobil 1 is used by more than 50 percent of teams throughout NASCAR’s top three series. Harvick will also have Christopher Bucciarelli’s name on his Mobil 1 Ford Mustang during the Darlington 500k in continuation of NASCAR’s support of The Real Heroes initiative. Bucciarelli works in imaging at the Novant Health Matthews Medical Center and is from Monroe, North Carolina. He spent 11 years as a United States Navy corpsman and had three combat deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan as a corpsman for the United State Marine Corps. Bucciarelli joined Novant in 2018 and is regarded as dependable, loyal and always willing to go above and beyond for his patients and team members. He volunteered to work at the field hospital that was planned during the COVID-19 crisis. He realized his passion for emergency care during his time working with Med Center 1 in 2018 after Hurricane Florence. Bucciarelli’s son Keegan, who is 6, are avid NASCAR fans, and his favorite driver is Harvick. Here’s hoping Mobil 1, along with Bucciarelli, can help Harvick score win number 51, which would put him only three behind Lee Petty for 11th on the all-time NASCAR wins list. TSC PR

WARRENSBURG — Warrensburg School District Superintendent Scott Patrick discussed how summer school, graduation and food services are being impacted by the ongoing pandemic at the Tuesday, May 19, Warrensburg School Board of Education meeting.
 District response to COVID-19
 Patrick said the district will have summer school for high school students but will not be having summer school for kindergarten through eighth grade.
 “We had talked about some various scenarios, the possibility of doing something virtual,” Patrick said. “We are not prepared to do that. We don’t have the infrastructure, don’t have the time, necessarily, to do that between now and when school is going to start.”
 Patrick said the district will have an extended school year, using packets and other resources, for special education students who require it for the completion of their Individualized Education Program.
 The district will also not have Adventure Club this summer.
 Assistant Superintendent Michael Scott said the plan for June for the summer feeding program is to have meals available for curb-side pick up Monday through Thursday at Sterling Elementary, Martin Warren Elementary, Reese Education Center and Maple Grove Elementary. Meals for Fridays will be distributed on Thursdays.
 Scott said the district is delivering to about 1,000 students, for breakfast and lunch, while school buildings are closed and the district is currently providing meals to a total of about 2,000 students.
 Patrick also discussed the district’s plan should the pandemic continue into the 2020-2021 school year.
 “If we would find ourselves back in this situation again ... as we have said before, we are going to have one or more than one backup plan and one of those is definitely some kind of one-to-one initiative that will allow us to have virtual education,” Patrick said.
 Patrick said the district has two possible dates, June 13 and a day in July, for graduation but does not have a definite plan in place at this time.
 2020-2021 start date
 The board discussed possible changes to the start date of the 2020-2021 school year.
 The Missouri State Board of Education voted May 12 to grant exemptions to the school start date law, HB 604, which mandates a school year cannot begin 14 days before the first Monday in September.
 At the Jan. 28 Board of Education meeting, the Warrensburg School Board of Education approved the 2020-2021 school year to begin Aug. 26.
 “I’m not recommending, I don’t know that any of us are recommending that we start any earlier or later,” Patrick said.
 Nurse position
 The board approved a full time nurse position in the district.
 Assistant Superintendent Andy Kohl said the administration sought approval for another nurse in anticipation of any health concerns for next school year in light of the pandemic and this was a position that would help to ease some of the strain on other school nurses.
 This position would float between all school buildings.

Clark's pre-Superman wanderings were important in terms of developing the character and allowing Clark to find his place in the world. The scene in the bar where Clark defends a waitress was an opportunity to see Clark avoid a physical fight and turn the other cheek when confronted by a bully. In this moment, he has a choice to walk away. And the idea that he can simply walk away was also an interesting notion to Snyder. He admitted to being really taken by the idea of Clark Kent hitchhiking. "He could run anywhere, but he's not in a hurry."

For protesters across the country, a haircut is a political statement.


  Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, made a statement recently by getting his first pandemic haircut from a hairdresser who was jailed for defying the state's order to close her salon.


  A barber in New York drew the disapproval of state officials, after continuing to give haircuts against orders. The barber later tested positive for the coronavirus.


  Wednesday's protest was organized by the Michigan Conservative Coalition, the same group that organized Operation Gridlock in Lansing in April.


  This protest was billed as Operation Haircut in support of 77-year-old-barber Karl Manke whose license has been revoked and is now in a court battle with the state after opening up his business during the stay-at-home order.


  But some customers and business owners aren't so eager to return to salons and barber shops, even those that will open under strict safety protocols.


  Nefertiti Harris, owns Textures by Nefertiti, a salon that caters to Detroit's black community which has been particularly hard-hit by COVID-19.


  She said she finds it hard to believe that people are protesting to get their hair cut and to open salons and barbers back up.


  "Are they really chomping at the bit to get their hair cut? I mean, are those protests really about that? I question that. I don't even think it's about a haircut at all. ... When you have lost so many loved ones to this disease you think twice," said Harris.


  The freedom to make that decision depends on where you live. In states like Missouri and Arkansas, barbers and salons have sprung back to life.


  In others, like Michigan, even as remote parts of the state reopen, salons and barbers remain closed, and according to Gov. Gretchen Whitmer are unlikely to reopen even after the stay-at-home order has been lifted.

Today, we're talking to all these retail people that we’re working the rest of the retail that we got up on the board in this room, the rest of the retail just went to sleep for a long time or gone rogue.

Obviously I can only speak from my own experience but in the past it has – not on all sets – felt like you have got to really hold your own and maybe you're not listened to, or you're spoken over. There's no malice in it, It's just an unconscious habit. Sometimes you have in the back your mind ‘Oh gosh they’re going to think I’m difficult because I’m disagreeing’ when actually it’s perfectly fine to offer another way of approaching a scene. I’ve certainly found there's a lot more of an even keel in terms of having a voice heard. I think there's still a way to go but now if I had an idea about something or a suggestion I wouldn't feel like I’m having to drum up the courage to do it – it wouldn’t feel as courageous an act. It feels like you're invited to the party now.

He added, "What we have to do between now and November is make sure that every single voter in every single state has a choice. The choice to vote on election day. So the choice to early vote, the more days of early voting, the more social distancing you do and the right to vote absentee with no excuse, the right to vote by mail. Republicans and Democrats agree on that. This president, in a desperate effort to steal an election, is going to stop at nothing."

_Elementary_ taught me a lot because it was such a slick operation and Lucy Liu and Johnny Lee Miller are both such great actors. The thing I loved was they were very responsive to what you do with the character - the producers and writers allowed you to have creative freedom. If you said, ‘Is it OK if I play it like this?’ they welcome you developing the character because they write it as you go along. Whereas with British TV everything's written in advance. _Hooten & The Lady_ was challenging - we got to travel all over the place and you’re stroking an elephant’s trunk (that’s not an innuendo!) and thinking, ‘I’m in Cambodia, this is absolutely mad’. If I was able to tell 10-year-old me she’d be in Cambodia filming…you dream of it then you get to do it!

 South Carolina and the United States are facing unprecedented times. As we come together to face a crisis head-on by working closely with private organizations, taking measures to ensure small businesses have what they need to preserve jobs, and making sure that families stay healthy and safe, House Democrats are using this crisis as an opportunity to seize additional powers by expanding government overreach and infringing on freedom.
 Last week, I spoke on the House Floor in opposition to this parade of absurdities on behalf of America's children. Our families, small businesses, and hospitals need support now, more than ever. Unfortunately, Congress could not come together to fight for our families and jobs.
 Instead, we have the largest out-of-control spending package yet, a $3 trillion wish list that House Democrats put forward. A bill that truly shows that Democrats will let no crisis go to waste. While millions of Americans are out of work and our families are attempting to recover, Democrats are mortgaging the future of younger Americans.
 This massive, partisan bill truly shows that House Democrats will let no crisis go to waste. This liberal wish list included paying illegal immigrants and giving billions of dollars to states who have already ruined their economy, while states like South Carolina are already cautiously reopening their economy. That's why I voted against this legislation.
 The next Democratic power grab was a vote to allow proxy voting in the House. This pandemic is no excuse to forget our Constitution. If Congress was able to vote on the House Floor last week, surely Members can conduct official business in a safe manner that follows guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control going forward.
 Congress should be at work, setting an important example to the American people of this new normal. I am committed to fighting for jobs in our community and our national security. I am also committed to our men and women in uniform. We cannot sit idly by and not do our jobs like Democrats want. We must work to pass bills, such as the National Defense Authorization Act so that our troops and their families are healthy and safe.
 Now is the time for Congress to work together to help our families recover from the coronavirus pandemic, it is not the time for partisan politics. I will continue to work for the Second District to ensure that we recover from this pandemic while also working for jobs and our national security. Now is the time for resilience, not power grabs.

And out of that 280 to 300 trucks that run that, we did replace some of the freight on those trucks through some broker freight and some other customer freight, and then some of the freight that picked up with pause of the COVID. So grocery and paper goods and all that kind of stuff. So a little bit zero revenue on those trucks during the middle of March when the plant shutdown. But it was quite a scramble at the end of March, because the timing of the plant closures were a little quicker than we had been told, they were looking at week out two weeks out when they all of a sudden, one bank decides now we're going to close that. And so that took the brand one of the last few week of March, but April use some of those trucks and some of them got furloughed, et cetera.

What this letter indicates is that, for all the rhetoric, the NHS Confederation does not yet believe that the government has a robust plan for virus testing and tracking of contacts of those who are infected.
 And that comes even after the prime minister's statement that such a programme will be in place by 1 June with 25,000 contact tracers appointed.
 A widespread testing and tracing system is seen as a necessity if lockdown restrictions are to be further eased, including the reopening of schools.
 The confederation, which represents health leaders and organisations in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, does welcome Mr Johnson's commitment to a testing and tracing programme.
 But tellingly it notes that its members are not yet reassured, and that if there is not rapid action there could be a second wave of infections and serious consequences for NHS patients and staff.

Not all secrets are as easy to keep as Clark Kent's true identity. Still, that doesn't make the reveal any less rewarding. This morning director Zack Snyder hosted a watch party and live commentary of _Man of Steel_ (2013) on the social media app Vero, followed by a fan Q&A. In the same format as his _Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice_ (2016) commentary in March, Snyder shared behind the scenes stories, storyboards, and Easter eggs. All of this served as the lead up to an unprecedented announcement, with special guest, the man in blue himself, Henry Cavill. There will certainly be much to talk about in the coming months, but for now the _Man of Steel_ commentary provides an opportunity to go back to where the DC film universe first began.
