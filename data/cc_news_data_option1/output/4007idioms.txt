 Among those named in the FIR are HTTL managing director, Ashok Kumar Bansal; and director, Anju Bansal. Unknown bank officials are also under the scanner. The complaint was filed by the Punjab National Bank on behalf of the consortium.
 ## 3 facilities
 HTTL has a soft-toy manufacturing facility, a home-furnishing product facility and a textile processing facility in Uttar Pradesh’s Noida and Roorkee in Uttarakhand. It approached the consortium for credit facilities, which was sanctioned.
 As alleged, HTTL defaulted on honouring its commitments towards letters of credit and guarantees. Accordingly, restructuring of the account was done in 2014. However, it did not adhere to the terms of reconstruction and the account slipped into the non-performing asset category.
 The forensic audit report, received in September 2019, revealed several alleged financial irregularities.
 Transactions to the tune of ₹11,257 crore were routed through one Almondz Impex Private Limited. However, its office was not found at the given address. The Corporate Affairs Ministry website revealed that the firm was set up in February 2013 but had not filed any balance-sheet. Its name has now been struck off by the Ministry.
 Usher Agro Limited, a vendor of Hanung Toys that deals in agro products, had been declared a fraud by banks, said the FIR.
 The audit detected that payments on account of exports were not realised, and for imports, the banks had to make payments under the letters of credit arrangement, it is alleged.
 “Non-realisation of proceeds is deviation of merchant trade, also it is not possible that all of a sudden all buyers stop making payment,” said the FIR, adding that the company undertook transactions with the parties that were not in the line of its business. Besides, a mismatch in figures suggested that the books of accounts were forged.
 The accused company transacted with international firms that were not in the business of soft toys and textiles, which raised suspicion.

PIERRE, S.D.

Fire department volunteer Gerrit Tronvold was driving to a training session in 2016 when he ran a stop sign north of Pierre and collided with a motorcycle ridden by Randall Jurgens and Lisa Tammen. Both suffered life-threatening injuries and had to have their left legs amputated. Jurgens and Tammen say the city should be held responsible because Tronvold was on his way to a fire department meeting. He was not injured in the crash. In dispute is whether the training session was mandatory. The high court is hearing the case this week and will rule at a later date, KELO-TV reported.

Now that the Google Wifi app is being rolled into the Home App, you will set up the new router with the latter straight out of the box. Each “point” is capable of providing up to 1500 sq. ft of coverage in your home and you’ll enjoy the security of WPA3 encryption, automatic security updates, and Google’s Trusted Platform Module. Like the original, these can be set up as a mesh network. Google also touts that the new Wifi’s plastic is made of 47% recycled materials. I definitely think that the Nest routers are a “smarter” purchase if you are into the smart home scene but this refresh makes sense for buyers who simply want fast reliable Wifi coverage. The other advantage is that a single Google Wifi only costs $99 which is $70 less than the main Nest Wifi alternative. You can find the new Google Wifi in a single pack or a three-pack on the Google Store and Best Buy right now.

PHILADELPHIA (AP) — Occupants of a small homeless encampment outside the Philadelphia Housing Authority departed Monday night under an agreement that officials hope will lead to the clearing of a much larger encampment that has been on the city's Benjamin Franklin Parkway for months. Approximately 20 people are to begin a process that will eventually get them into nine now-vacant homes in northwest Philadelphia, with several of them working on rehabilitation of the houses, the Philadelphia Inquirer reported. Mayor Jim Kenney said Monday that he hoped the pact “will lead to a resolution of the separate protest encampment\" of 100 to 150 people on the parkway, as well as two other ancillary sites. Kenney called issues of homelessness and lack of affordable housing “deep-rooted and urgent.” The tent encampment on the parkway was erected on a baseball field June 10 and the one outside the housing authority in north Philadelphia later that month. Organizers said the camps were tied to the Black Lives Matter movement and were demanding equal access to fair, safe and affordable housing. Philadelphia Housing Action — the coalition of groups that organized the encampment — said it was conceived as a form of political protest over homeless policies and the lack of low-income housing. “We’re proud that we were able to get a win like this,\" the newspaper quoted PHA organizer Jennifer Bennetch as saying. A federal judge earlier gave the green light for the city to clear out the encampments but required occupants to receive at least 72 hours’ notice and said any property seized must be stored and returned. City officials have ordered people there to leave several times, but relented each time. Officials had said more than 138 people had accepted aid such as transitional housing in COVID-19 spaces in hotels, or...

There are several elements that make a Fleet Foxes album great. Layered vocals, daring instrumental swells and vibrant, at times anxious, lyrics are all present throughout their catalogue, from the assured folk-pop of their 2008 self-titled debut to the magnificent existential ramblings on 2017’s _Crack-Up_. These signifiers are all present on their new album _Shore_ , but the effects are much more nuanced. Fleet Foxes remain a quintessential millennial band, and, on _Shore_ —which dropped with only a day’s warning—they’re once again tapping into the millennial psyche, this time with a little more optimism. Upon first listen, _Shore_ lacks the immediacy of _Fleet Foxes_ and 2011’s _Helplessness Blues_ —at least from a sonic standpoint. But frontman Robin Pecknold’s astonishingly thoughtful lyrics quickly bring the listener back up to speed, at times recalling the grandiose scope of _Crack-Up_ ’s more cheerful moments, even if the indie-rock stylings are lagging a bit. _—Ellen Johnson_

Celebration to be marked with day of activities
   
 A local legend and hero would be celebrating 130 years of life this year. Even though he died in 1969, Denison and the surrounding areas continue to celebrate the works of former President Dwight D. Eisenhower.
   
 This year's birthday celebration for the Denison native will be just as large but will have a socially distanced them.
   
 "I think that it is important that we pass on Eisenhower's importance to our youngsters so that they can see how history has changed and he molded our society," Main Street Director Donna Dow said. "It is specifically important to us because he was born here."
   
 On Oct. 10, the city will hold its annual brick-laying ceremony for the Eisenhower monument. Festivities will begin at 8 a.m. with music and a reading for the names of the people who will have bricks laid at the site in their honor.
   
 A larger formalized ceremony will be held at 10 a.m. at the Eisenhower Auditorium at Scott Middle School. Dow said this is possible due in part to the size of the auditorium, which allows for social distancing.
   
 This year's festivities will also feature the return of the Wall of Honor throughout the month of October at the Katy Depot. The wall features 231 photos of local veterans ranging from those who served in World War I to present.
   
 Dow said that Eisenhower was always passionate about the armed forces, so it made sense to work the two events together.
   
 "We have a committee that works on the Eisenhower birthday. Of course, we are all passionate about veterans and their contributions to the freedoms we enjoy."
   
 Dwight D. Eisenhower was born in 1890 into a railroad family that had settled into a small white house near the tracks in Denison. Eisenhower's father worked with the railroad as an engine wiper.
   
 Eisenhower's stay in Denison was brief, and he moved early in life to Abilene, Kansas which he later in life referred to as his hometown. It wasn't until later in adulthood that Eisenhower would return to his birthplace.
   
 Eisenhower rose to fame through his military career, which was capped of when he became the Supreme Allied Commander during World War II, and helped orchestrate the landings on Normandy Beach -- one of the largest military operations in history.
   
 Following his military career, Eisenhower was courted by both political parties as a potential presidential candidate. Eisenhower eventually ran as a Republican candidate and was elected as the 34th President of the United States in 1952.
   
 Other contributions of Eisenhower include his work in the establishment of NASA and his work in creation an interstate highway system.
   
 "He made such an impact on American society and we are blessed to have that connection," Dow said. "Sure there is a tourism aspect, but for a lot of people it is much more personal than that.
   
 "It is about how you can be born in a house by the railroad tracks, not have family wealth, and still work hard and become a great world leader and president. To me, it is a message of hope and a message of pride."
   
 Traditionally, students with Denison Independent School District would conduct field trips to the birthplace as a part of the anniversary. However, COVID-19 led organizers to instead focus on in class study and presentations this year.
   
 "So, we are going to be doing more things to feature his visits to Denison in the future," Dow said, referring to a trip Eisenhower made as a hero to his birthplace where he was served breakfast with U.S. Speaker of the House Sam Rayburn.
   
 "We always like to showcase the Texas Big Breakfast because it also highlights our volunteers and we tie that in because it took volunteers and local citizenry to preserve the birthplace and we are very fortunate that that occurred."

In a block or so, you’ll be at another highway ramp, again with no crosswalk, then you get to a traffic light by the New York State Psychiatric Institute building. This is the spot where Riverside Drive changes personality from ugly highway to normal-looking city street.

BELDING, Mich. (AP) — A western Michigan company faces a $115,000 fine as part of a proposed consent order with the state over safety concerns tied to the use of a chemical used to make chlorine tablets for swimming pools. Kassouni Manufacturing in Belding also has been ordered by the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy to prevent future air quality violations, WOOD-TV reported. The state said trichloroisocyanuric acid was not disposed of properly at the facility, northwest of Grand Rapids.
