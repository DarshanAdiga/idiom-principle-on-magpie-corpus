My favourite caller was the out-of-work actor who phoned in bemoaning that times were particularly hard for actors at the moment, with which Bellamy fervently agreed. I wonder if any other actors or comedians, recently at a loose end – someone like Rhys Thomas, just to pluck a name from the air – might have been tempted to take part in the comeback of a magnificent parody of a radio phone-in to help pay the bills. I’m very grateful to them if so.

Thank goodness for brave and forthright radio broadcasters who tell it like it is, and none are more fearless than the award-winning Gary Bellamy. Bellamy, who has won several awards for his no-nonsense hosting of phone-ins on a range of heritage radio networks from Radio 4 to Radio Wickford, is back, a safe pair of hands to give the nation a voice during the pandemic.
