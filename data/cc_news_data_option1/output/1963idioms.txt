For example, the district is currently looking at how to redesign the nurse's offices. The superintendent said one part of the office will most likely be dedicated to basic needs like administering medication to students, while a separate part of the office will be for students or staff who are feeling ill.
 "We are going to wait for the state and city officials before we bring students and staff back," Gallagher said, "and obviously, everyone will be well-informed of the plan. We are still waiting for guidance from the commissioner and the governor regarding the reopening of schools."
 This past week, the district began offering time slots for families to pick up students' belongings at Edward G. Molin Upper Elementary School and Rupert A. Nock Middle School. Staff removed items from each student's locker and placed them in individual trash bags for curbside pickup.
 Additionally, Assistant Superintendent Angela Bik said the district has been in conversations about how to hold summer programming. While much is still unknown, Bik is hopeful that there will be some curriculum enrichment opportunities for students.
 Though most of it may still take place remotely, she said face-to-face activities are not yet out of the question. Bik said the summer could be a test run for what may take place in the fall with smaller groups of people and social distancing still intact.
 "If we have the opportunity to do some summer programming in person, we were hoping to test out a little bit of the hybrid model over the summer," Bik said.

Jaguars (2016-2017) - Also a lackluster one, you’ll see my point in a second. Being one of the laughing stocks of the NFL, the Jaguars came out with a force during the 2017 campaign. Going from 3-13 to a Touchdown away from a Super Bowl, this was one of the most surprising turnarounds ever. Although they had success then, “Sacksonville” had a guy at the helm of their offense who was never going to get it done. Putting their faith in Blake Bortles and (I apologize) washed Tom Coughlin was an inevitable recipe for disaster. Just like the Dolphins, there was no one path to follow after 2017. It’s impossible to have continued success through the Draft and FA like they did, especially with a mediocre at best QB at the helm.

Earlier this month, Tran Ngoc Thai Son, founder and CEO of Tiki, proposed a few relief measures to support e-commerce and tech firms over the coronavirus crisis. Among them, e-commerce and tech companies are looking to access public capital markets to accelerate capital raising and finance key investments. Therefore, he proposed the state to loosen the IPO rules for local firms. According to the current rules, companies need to meet three-year profitability requirements to file for an IPO. This makes Tiki and other e-commerce players ineligible for listing on the Vietnamese stock market given that they have been wilfully suffering mounting losses to scale up presence. Lowering IPO criteria could help e-commerce firms like Tiki access the Vietnamese equity market Tiki's CEO suggested the state to launch a pilot to remove the profitability requirement. As a result, e-commerce and tech companies could conduct IPOs to raise capital, improve operating capacity, and build a reputation in the market. However, the proposal has been questioned as e-commerce companies have always been in the red due to the "money burning" race to capture market share.

At this point, investors would do well to consider the meaning of the morbid phrase, "you don't have to outrun the bear, you just have to outrun your friend." This hypothetical scenario refers to a bunch of human campers trying to outrun a hungry bear that is chasing them (and which is faster than humans, but can't catch all of them).
 In other words, policymakers around the world can't afford to let a massive deflationary economic collapse occur, and for millions and millions of people to be unable to afford the necessities of life and for half of large companies to go out of business, so they will be forced to keep the stimulus taps open, funded with printed money, with a willingness to devalue currency to avoid the worst case economic scenario. Cheap stocks that survive and go on to rebound, are likely an opportune set of investments.
 That doesn't mean that the large stock indices won't go down; in fact I think they've come too far too fast and could use a reality check. And it certainly doesn't mean every company is safe; many of the weaker ones with a lot of leverage are dead weight and I wouldn't touch them.
 But a sweet spot in my view is companies that have recently become cheap and that will have a tough 2020 and 2021, but have among the strongest balance sheets in their industry and structurally strong business models in a post- virus scenario. If we start with the premise that, say, the whole steel industry won't go bankrupt, or the whole automotive industry, or the whole multifamily housing industry, or the whole banking industry, and so forth (especially all at once in a mass collapse), then the question becomes, "which players are the strongest in their industries, the best-positioned to outlast their peers and make it through to the next reflationary cycle?" That's where I am looking and buying for some of my risk exposure.

Whether you just picked up a new iPhone SE, Samsung Galaxy A51, or any other phone, one of the first things you should do -- after you've processed the initial rush of excitement -- is an important task that will help keep your phone secure and in smooth, working order. Transfer the accounts being used by your Google Authenticator app so you can access your two-factor codes on your new device. Otherwise, you may find yourself unable to log into some of your online accounts.
 Two-factor authentication (2FA) adds an extra layer of security to your online accounts by requiring a randomly generated six-digit code after you've successfully entered your password. As privacy concerns continue to rise amid breach after breach, two-factor authentication is increasingly recommended as a way to help fortify your online security by making it harder for others to log in as "you."
 Most websites give you the option to receive your 2FA codes through SMS texting or using a dedicated app like Google Authenticator, but we don't recommend using SMS. Hackers have had a lot of success tricking wireless carriers into switching the SIM card associated with a person's phone number and in turn, receive the two-factor codes sent to the actual user's phone number. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey is a prime example.
 Google recently updated the Android version of its Authenticator app, the first update in a few years. It adds a fancy new transfer tool that removes the painstaking process of individually moving your accounts between your old and new phones, which makes moving your 2FA codes simpler than ever. We'll also explain how to do this on an iPhone.

Police chiefs in outlying Winnebago County municipalities say they are not taking enforcement action against citizens regarding the statewide stay-at- home order in effect in Illinois until June 1.
 The development comes after Winnebago County Sheriff Gary Caruana told Rockford media he made the personal decision not to enforce the order on recommendation from the Illinois Sheriffs Association.
 South Beloit Police Chief Adam Truman said his department will not respond to complaints of people not wearing personal protective equipment (PPE) including masks or face coverings and won’t follow up on complaints about social distancing.
 “We’re not going to respond unless there are other issues such as arguing, fighting, etc.,” Truman said. “We encourage voluntary compliance but will not be issuing any citations.”
 For businesses potentially violating the order, Truman said the department would forward any potential violation to the Winnebago County Health Department and State’s Attorney’s Office for review and possible action.
 “Although there is a lot of rapidly evolving information coming in, that’s where I stand at this point,” Truman said.
 In Rockton, Police Chief Stephen Dickson said his department enforces laws and ordinances to maintain safety and public order.
 “The stay-at-home order is neither of those,” Dickson said. “The only enforceable parts are closing of businesses that are regulated by the State in some fashion. The order allows for travel for a number of reasons. It is not up to my agency to keep people in their homes, make sure they wear PPE or not allow them to peacefully assemble.”
 Roscoe Police Chief Jamie Evans said her department had received complaints from village residents regarding people not wearing face masks or people not observing social distancing recommendations, but police officers did not take any enforcement action.
 “We are here to protect and serve and follow the law and the constitution, we will do what is fair and right to act in the best interest of our citizens,” Evans said.
 In response to Caruana’s comments, Winnebago County Health Department Administrator Sandra Martell said communities should not need to rely on law enforcement to “do the right thing to protect lives and livelihoods.”
 “I encourage our community to heed the governor’s executive order and Stay Home except for essential services. We would not want to jeopardize moving to the next Phase of Recovery,” Martell said.

Across the military, uncertainty about future jobs or college opportunities is driving more service members to re-enlist or at least postpone their scheduled departures. As unemployment, layoffs and a historic economic downturn grip the nation, the military — with its job security, steady paycheck and benefits — is looking much more appealing.
 "Everything from elementary schools to universities is closing down and there’s no saying how it’s going to go when the fall semester opens,” said Gozikowski, adding that he’s hoping schools start opening up for spring semester. "This is like a safety net. I have a source of income and I’ll be able to continue working.”
 Gozikowski, who is from Cherry Hill, New Jersey, and is serving at Fort Hood, Texas, is one of hundreds of service members who are taking advantage of newly developed, short-term extensions being offered by the military.
 As of last week, the army had already exceeded its retention goal of 50,000 soldiers for the fiscal year ending in September, re-enlisting more than 52,000 so far. And the other services have also met or are closer than planned to their target numbers. The influx of people re-enlisting will offset any shortfalls in recruiting, which has been hampered by the outbreak. And that will help the services meet their total required troop levels for the end of the year.
 "We're hiring,” said Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy. "Like anything, market dynamics come into effect and people will see where the opportunities lie.”
 Sgt. Maj. Stuart Morgan, the senior army career counselor, said Gozikowski was able to take advantage of a new program designed to help soldiers who were planning to leave this year but are now worried and reconsidering their options. The program allows them to delay their departure for up to 11 months to get them past the peak coronavirus period. By early last week, he said, 745 soldiers had signed up.
 "What we’re seeing this year, which is directly related to COVID, is we do have a population of soldiers that what they were expecting at the end of transition has suddenly disappeared,” Morgan said. "And now you have a soldier that is trying to go through a transition period that is now facing uncertainty on the outside.”
 The U.S. Air Force is on track to meet its recruiting goal, but expects to fall short of its effort to get recruits through the training pipeline by as much as 5,800 as a result of the virus. That gap, the air force said, could be filled by service members who decide to re-enlist or extend their service.
 So far, the number of air force personnel who have withdrawn their requests to leave the service or have asked to extend their enlistment is 700 more than last year at this time, including 230 pilots and medical staff.
 For one pilot, the opportunity to make that sudden change of course was a relief. In discussing his plans, he asked that his name not be used to preserve any future employment options.
 Nearly two months ago, he was in Miami taking an airline certification course and getting ready for his next career. For months, he and his fellow pilots at Scott Air Force Base in Illinois had been talking about which airlines were hiring.
 "Everybody was getting out,” the 10-year transport aircraft pilot said in an interview from the air base. "The conversations were like, oh, who got picked up by Southwest, who got picked up by American, who got picked up by Delta. And then the whole coronavirus thing started to play its course.”
 Suddenly, he said, "the discussions are more like, what are we gonna do now?"
 The pilot said he was worried about the uncertainty. Even if he got a job, it might only be temporary, if the economic downturn continued.
 "I need stability in my life. There’s no steady income on the outside, or guaranteed income either,” said the pilot, adding that in the military, he’s guaranteed a job. "While other people are getting laid off and not working, we’re still collecting a paycheck and going to work.”
 Retention is also on the rise in the U.S. Marine Corps.
 Currently there are about 183,000 marines, and the goal for the end of the fiscal year is about 184,600. The Corps has nearly reached its retention goal of about 12,600 for the fiscal year, with only about 100 or so to get by the end of September. The U.S. Navy was not able to provide retention numbers.
 In addition, marines who were planning to leave the service are being allowed to extend their enlistments by a few months, to get past the initial COVID crisis, or by a year or two.
 Maj. Craig Thomas, a U.S. Marine Corps spokesman, said virus-related restrictions on recruiting and shipping new marines to initial training will likely mean the service won’t meet its goal for total force size this year. He added, however, that while it is too early to tell if the bad economy will further boost retention, the enlistment extensions could make up for the recruiting shortfalls.

PLYMOUTH - Whether you knew it by the name of the Plymouth Sports Dome, the Jungleplex, or even the Plymouth Sports Complex, since the summer of 1997 the building located off Long Pond Road at 8 Natalie Way in America's Hometown was always a hub of activity.
 It's been the place for athletes of all ages to play indoor soccer, lacrosse, volleyball and field hockey or even learn karate. It was also the go-to place for the high schools in town when the weather canceled spring practices. It was also packed to the rafters for mixed martial arts exhibitions and even a place for home shows and wedding exhibitions.
 Things are different now. These days there's no longer any kids running around the turf field chasing a soccer ball. Time marches on, things change and late in 2019 the building started to transition from an indoor sports emporium to a self-storage facility.
 But the memories remain.
 "I loved that place. I worked there in one form or another for about 20 years, I guess. It was an enjoyable time with some great memories, and I was able to work with a lot of awesome people. I lived just down the street from the building so I always loved that short drive to work," said Plymouth native Jason Tassinari, a former general manager of the facility who estimates that he officiated more than 6,000 soccer games there. "I had a lot of great times in that building and I will always think of it as a happy place for me."
 Original owners Carl Pratt, Dick Arietta, Al McChesney, Bill Weiler, Bill Johnson and Darin Yee first inflated the fabric roof of the Plymouth Sports Dome in the summer of 1997 and Tassinari joined on as an assistant manager and referee coordinator the next year. The bread-and-butter in the early days of the business was soccer training on the indoor and outdoor fields, but operations would expand in other directions over the years. Business was usually strong in the months from August to April; the key to the sustained success of the venture was finding revenue to help keep the lights on in the off-months.
 McChesney joined up with the ownership group as they were putting the final touches on what would become the Plymouth Sports Dome.
 "I got to know Darin Yee because we played together in the same men's hockey league," McChesney said. "They needed more money for the project and were looking for another investor to jump into the mix. I looked into what they were planning to do and liked the idea, so I joined up with them."
 "All of us had our lives outside of the business, but we came together to try and get this idea off of the ground. (Former Silver Lake boys soccer coach Bill Johnson and late SL boys basketball coach Dick Arieta) were the ones that got the ball rolling on this," McChesney said.
 McChesney said that when business was booming he was having as much fun as the kids chasing soccer balls under the dome roof.
 "It was a great seven years," remembered McChesney. "Walking into the building each weekend was like a scene out of Cheers. You looked around the lobby and there were people you knew all over the place. It really was the lifeblood of the community back then."
 Things were going well for the business until Mother Nature stepped in and threw everyone a curve ball in January 2005 with a winter storm that literally brought the roof down.
 "We had a smaller issue in December 2004 when a corner of the roof collapsed because of the weight of the snow. That should have been a sign to all of us that we were in trouble," Tassinari said. "Then there was a bigger storm on the way with a lot of snow and wind. None of us felt easy with what was coming. It was a nerve-racking time for all of us."
 It was all hands on deck when the storm finally hit town. Over a 48-hour period everyone did all they could to keep the bubble inflated, but the weight of the snow eventually brought down a section of the roof.
 The building was closed for a couple of years before returning with a new steel structure, a new ownership group, and a new name. But the Jungleplex could never get back the numbers it enjoyed before the roof collapsed. The facility was still being used for indoor games until the coronavirus outbreak earlier this year finally closed the doors for good.
 "Dave Wickson and I refereed maybe a thousand games together in that building. We were planning to do the last soccer game in the building together, but unfortunately life stepped in the way and changed all of our plans," Tassinari said. "I refereed games at the Jungleplex from back when I was a college freshman. It was a labor of love, and I was very sad to see the business go."

EGLIN AFB -- An F-35A Lightning II assigned to the 58th Fighter Squadron crashed upon landing around 9:30 p.m. Tuesday at Eglin AFB, according to a news release from the 33rd Fighter Wing.
   
 The pilot safely ejected, according to the release, and was taken to the 96th Medical Group at the base for what the release calls "evaluation and monitoring." The pilot was listed in stable condition Tuesday night.
   
 There was no loss of life nor damage to civilian property as a result of the crash, according to the 33rd Fighter Wing.
   
 "At the time of the accident, the pilot was participating in a routine night training sortie," according to the wing's news release. The pilot's name "is not being released at this time," the wing's release stated.
   
 First responders from the 96th Test Wing, the host unit at Eglin AFB, responded to the scene, and the crash site has been secured, the release continued.
   
 The accident is under investigation. Routinely in the case of Air Force crashes, both a safety investigation board and an accident investigation board are convened. The safety investigation board report is not released to the public, but the accident investigation board report is made public. It can take months, or sometimes years, to complete an accident investigation report.
   
 Tuesday's crash comes just four days after an F-22 Raptor crashed on the Eglin AFB reservation. The Friday crash occurred 12 miles northeast of the main part of the sprawling base, on a closed portion of the installation.
   
 The pilot of the F-22 safely ejected from the aircraft, and there was no loss of life or damage to civilian property associated with that crash, according to base public affairs officials. That crash is now under investigation.

Converse College athletics director Jenn Bell recently made a monumental hire, picking Ryan Saunders to be the first coach of a men's sport in the 131-year history of the school.
   
 "I cannot wait to meet him," Bell said.
   
 That's right. They have not been face-to-face, talking only through video conversations on Zoom. Social distancing and quarantine measures due to the COVID-19 coronavirus made it challenging. But Bell and others on the selection committee felt strongly enough about Saunders as men's basketball head coach to make it a virtual reality.
   
 "We decided that we needed to move forward with this," Bell said. "We could've sat back and waited and waited for things to clear up, not knowing when we would move ahead. But we decided that we just had to deal with it and make the best of it. Thank goodness for technology. We were able to do everything that normally would've done except for being face-to-face."
   
 Converse is adding basketball, soccer, tennis, track and field, cross country and volleyball as men's sports beginning in the 2021-22 academic year, when the school will change its name to Converse University. Teams will compete as full members of the NCAA Division II Conference Carolinas.
   
 "It's an exciting time to start men's programs," said Bell, a former Dorman High standout volleyball player (as Jennifer Nodine) who played and coached that sport at Wofford as well. "We're working on our hires. Those folks will officially come on board in July or August. They'll start recruiting and will have a whole year to get ready."
   
 Saunders, who was as associate head coach in his fifth year at Belmont Abbey, also in Conference Carolinas, helped the Crusaders this season to a 21-10 record, 14-6 in league play. They made it to the league championship game and earned an at-large invitation to the Division II national tournament, which was canceled because of COVID-19.
   
 "I think we all had to rely on faith and gut feelings a little bit with this hiring process," Saunders said. "But the research is the same. I had a great comfort level with Jenn Bell and everyone. I knew it was a good situation. She and president (Krista) Newkirk have tremendous vision. The conversations we had made my decision very easy."
   
 Saunders said he wants his team to start winning games from the opening tip next fall. But, more importantly, he said, his job is to find players with the right kind of character to match their talent, players who will politely entire this new era instead of rudely crashing the all-female party.
   
 "We don't want to take a few years to get rolling. We want to be competitive in Conference Carolinas as early as possible," Saunders said. "But I don't want guys who will disrespect the history of the college. There might be some people and some alums who aren't real comfortable about the direction of the college. There might be students who are thinking, 'I came to an all-women's school. I'm not sure how I feel about men coming in.' So it's going to be important for me to bring in the right kind of people who will respect those who have been here.
   
 "I want guys with mindsets similar to mine. This is a great opportunity to be a part of history. But we're going to be under a microscope. It's going to be ultra-important to find the right guys for the school and the community."
   
 Saunders recently got a call from Dale Layer, who started the men's program at previously all-women's school Queens University in Charlotte. He led that team from 1988 to 1998, is now a member of its hall of fame and in 2013 had the court named for him. He was 168-88 at Queens and won three league championships. Layer went on to Colorado State (head coach from 2000-07), Liberty, Marquette, back to Liberty as head coach (2009-15) and Mercer. He was a special assistant to Buzz Williams at Virginia Teach and went with him to Texas A&M.;
   
 "I thought it was super-cool that Coach Layer called me," Saunders said. "I didn't know he had started the men's program at Queens. He told me to understand how lucky I am. And that if I did things the right way, people will look back at this time and say it was pretty special."

For example, public transportation has long been one of the benefits of living in a city. But new priorities — ensuring less crowding during peak hours and maintaining cleaning regimens without impacting ridership — may prove difficult.

Streets may need to close to encourage more social distancing or to encourage restaurants, bars and music venues to transition to open-air.

I think big picture, one way to think about it would be that we're going to sell a broad assortment across merchandise categories and services to customers. And we're going to do that as they come into our stores and clubs as they utilize pick up on-site and as we deliver to their home and eventually into their home. And what we will do is design and execute a supply chain underneath that, that leverages all of our assets. So there'll be times when it makes sense for an order to go straight from an FC based on what that order is comprised of, there'll be other times where that may be split between stores and fulfillment centers. There are other times where it may flow completely through a store. Maybe even John receiving something from a fulfillment center to a store, joining our last mile delivery, which I know you've been working on, as we speak. I think we just learn over time how to manage the costs underneath that top-line demand. And we've got a lot of assets to use, a lot of flexibility to balance speed, expectations of service with cost.

First there was "The Trip," a six-part, three-hour BBC TV series with Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon playing Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon ... or at least fairly close versions of themselves. The show presented them as friends or, more accurately, close acquaintances who, between acting jobs, got a writing assignment to drive through the north of England, hop from hotel to hotel, and eat lunches in fancy restaurants, then report on the experiences. The charm of the whole thing was captured in their conversations, most involving history and pop culture and any topic imaginable practically in between. The charm of that charm was in full flower when the discussions started including impersonations of celebrities - Michael Caine and Sean Connery among them - and an ever-spiraling sense of competition between the two guys over who could do the better one.      It was a wonderfully entertaining and meandering series of half-hour shows which were eventually edited into the feature film "The Trip." Which begat the series and the movies "The trip to Italy" and "The Trip to Spain," and has now resulted in the fourth and supposedly final installment, "The Trip to Greece." More driving, hotels, restaurants, conversation and imitations.      But the shows and films haven't been just a lot of goofiness. In and around all of the talking, viewers have been treated to two spot-on improvisors - and gifted imitators - who are operating with all pistons firing, and are regularly and successfully trying to crack each other up. But there's much more, and credit goes to the creator and director Michael Winterbottom, who has seamlessly instilled a serious side of things, a sense of gravitas, that keeps everything in balance.      These are comedies, but wrapped up inside them are personal issues that reveal what's making these characters tick. Truth be told, Coogan and Brydon are so good at this sort of thing, it's very difficult to pinpoint where the real people and their characters diverge. In previous entries, there have been looks at the relationship between Coogan and his son (Tim Leach) and the relationship between Brydon and his wife (Rebecca Johnson), and not all has been rosy. In "The Trip to Greece," the thin plotline brings in heartfelt and serious thoughts of mortality.      But, yes, it's still a comedy, and although Coogan and Brydon present it as a continuation of what they've done before, they make sure to infuse it with a breath of freshness. As does Winterbottom.      The director chose Greece partially because of the country's beauty, but also because of its history and its myths. The route he puts his protagonists on distantly mirrors the one taken by Odysseus in "The Odyssey." The actors - driving and eating and chattering away - let pieces of their real lives seep into their discussions, and they up the ante in the impressions competition (my favorites include a meeting between Stan Laurel - who Coogan played in the film "Stan & Ollie" \- and Tom Hardy, and one involving British actor Ray Winstone if he were to play Henry VIII) and, this time, even get into a physical contest over a swimming challenge.      As in the previous TV shows and films, there are six lunches, brief peeks - in extreme close-up - of the meals being prepared in restaurant kitchens, and visits by a couple of women from their publication. One of the odder things about all of this is that neither Coogan nor Brydon seem all that knowledgeable about the food they eat or the wine they drink. Or maybe that's just how they're playing the parts. But they certainly come across as an educated, well read pair of travelers with both shared and completely different interests in what they're seeing and talking about.      If this does turn out to be the final "Trip" film, that'll be too bad, because these have always been a joy to return to. But it also makes sense to end it here, as the Odysseus story is about going on and ending an extended voyage. To be sure, this has been a funny, thoughtful, long, strange one.      "The Trip to Greece" will be available on cable and digital VOD starting May 22.      Ed Symkus can be reached at esymkus@rcn.com.

With all of the stepped-up activity, the chances of a misunderstanding and accidental escalation is an “ever present danger,” Suorsa said.
 “This is an environment in which close adherence to agreed regulations and codes on unplanned encounters at sea and air, established lines of communication, as well as exercise of restraint on both sides becomes critical in avoidance of accidental escalation,” he said.

On the other hand, both the Chiefs and Niners came back to their winning ways for the same reasons. The Niners hired Kyle Shanahan and brought in Jimmy G, and the Chiefs hired Andy Reid and brought in Alex Smith. The combination of a smart HC and a QB more often than not transcend most franchise’s woes. The Niners took it even a step further and brought in a GM in John Lynch who was in sync with Shanahan on what they wanted to do. This blueprint has been executed on par, if not even better by the Miami Dolphins organization. In one year they took themselves out of cap hell and mediocrity to a team that has a bright future loaded with young talent. The Dolphins accomplished this by getting a GM/HC tandem that knew exactly what they wanted to do. They literally fleeced teams in trades, brought in a culture that has been missing for god knows how long, and executed one of them, if not the best smokescreen in NFL history. Acquiring Tua Tagovailoa while hiring Brian Flores and promoting Chris Grier should have Dolphins fans truly elated. They started this season losing by two blowouts, being torn apart by the national media, and being subjected to literal ridicule (still keeping tabs and waiting for the apology.) By the end of the season/off-season, we finished 5-11, established a culture, brought in a huge FA haul, but, most importantly, we got our Quarterback. The blueprint from former teams suggests an immediate improvement, and the weakening of the AFC means it’s ripe for the taking. I’m not saying we should expect a SuperBowl in the next 3 years, I’m not even saying that there won’t be ups and downs, but if recent history suggests what’s to come I would finally use something called optimism.

The virus has opened the doors to surveillance and monitoring technologies that many fear are here to stay. While such systems have been creeping into people’s lives across the globe — particularly in Asia, with China’s facial- recognition points system and South Korea’s invasive infection-tracking software — the trend runs up against Europe’s much-vaunted privacy culture. Europeans trading in privacy for safety now may find the longer-term consequences unacceptable.
 "The use of mass surveillance infrastructures can lead to a normalization of these highly intrusive tools, and the hasty introduction of apps, devices and cameras will, in the long term, lead to a dissolution of trust between employers and employees,” said Ella Jakubowska, a researcher at internet rights association Edri.
 Businesses are walking a fine line between keeping people safe and protecting their privacy. The absence of clear guidance from European regulators is forcing companies — who could also be on the hook if they don’t sufficiently protect workers — to make "extremely difficult decisions,” according to Daniel Cooper, a partner at law firm Covington and Burling, who advises clients on tech regulation.
 "The exposure of companies collecting that information goes up because it’s sensitive,” Cooper said. "They also have to balance the privacy rights of the people whose data they’re collecting and get that balance right and not break the law.”
 About 23 percent of companies surveyed globally are considering workplace tracking or contact tracing to transition back to on-site work, according to a study published this month by tax and consulting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers, which is testing its own contact tracing tool in its Shanghai office.
 Providers of such technologies tout them as a safe way to get people back to work and revive economies crushed by lockdowns. While many acknowledge the systems aren’t foolproof, they say infection risk can be capped.
 "Our bracelets are tools to keep workers safe and to increase performance,” said John Baekelmans, the chief executive officer of Rombit, the Belgian company whose 100-gram bracelets will add a tracing feature in June to allow Antwerp port doctors to keep track of a possible spread of the virus.
 Rombit sees the bracelets outlasting the virus as companies use them to track employees’ health and performance. The company says it will supply such devices to 300 companies in the coming weeks.
 Like Rombit, Poland-based Estimote Inc. is selling social distancing devices to factories, research centers and hospitals, which also let them trace contacts made by any infected staffer.
 The devices, attached to lanyards, buzz when workers have spent too much time near a colleague. Employees developing symptoms or testing positive can press a button on the gadget to notify the company, allowing it to trace all the people they’ve been in contact with.
 "It’s in our DNA to come close” to other people, said Estimote CEO Jakub Krzych, adding that the devices alert users to those habits, keeping the spread of the virus in check.
 Herta Security in Barcelona is developing both mask-detection technology and facial recognition for touchless access in workplaces, including for a global retail company that’s considering using it in its offices in Europe and Latin America, according to Laura Blanc Pedregal, Herta’s Chief Marketing Officer.
 Shopping malls and major transport hubs in Spain, France, Israel and the U.S. will be using Paris-based Outsight’s laser technology to ensure social distancing, its president and co-founder Raul Bravo said. Aeroports de Paris, which manages the French capital’s airports, is testing Outsight lasers to monitor passenger flows.
 Fever-checking thermal cameras are also starting to become ubiquitous. In Madrid, University Camilo Jose Cela is setting up a Chinese camera system that simultaneously measures students’ temperatures and checks if they’re wearing masks. Airports including London’s Heathrow and Paris’s Charles de Gaulle are testing thermal cameras.
 "We sell more cameras every week,” said Guenther Mull, CEO of German biometrics company Dermalog Identification Systems GmbH, which offers mask detection as an add-on to its software. "The demand is currently very high.”
 Privacy advocates are alarmed. Thermal cameras could be seen as an invasion of privacy, said Rob van Eijk, managing director for Europe at the Future of Privacy Forum, a nonprofit think tank.
 "It would pressure individuals with relatively higher body temperatures to disclose or divulge, likely against their will, their personal health information that might be unrelated to COVID-19 or other respiratory viral infections,” he said.
 In Europe, where breaching data protection laws can result in a fine of as much as 4 percent of annual global revenue, companies typically wouldn’t link temperature readings to names or store the information. Still, fever readings wouldn’t be difficult to trace back to an individual, said Covington and Burling’s Cooper.
 For now, the checks are being taken in stride. Consider the employees of Bayer 04 Leverkusen, the German soccer club, which invested in five Dermalog thermal cameras. When the Bundesliga became the first major soccer league to resume playing last weekend, the club was ready. It had been scanning its players when they came in for training.
 In late April, while much of Germany was sheltering in place, professional soccer player Leon Bailey stood at the entrance of the club’s training facilities to have his temperature taken. The camera zeroed in on his forehead to read a temperature of 37 degrees Celsius. No fever. He passed through the arena’s gates and joined his teammates for practice.
 "They see it’s for their own safety,” said Dr. Karl-Heinrich Dittmar, Bayer Leverkusen’s medical director, in an interview. "Nobody wants to become ill.”

The shrine also accepted messages from remote worshipers, displaying them on virtual wooden tablets that are then offered to Shinto gods to keep away evil spirits and the epidemic.
 "I thought about how people can pray and have peace of mind at a time when everyone is feeling uneasy about all the news and going through major changes in their life but still cannot go out to pray,” said head priest Ryoki Ono. "The idea is to provide a chance for people to pray from home.”
 For Machi Zama, a freelance writer, that’s just what she needed. Zama prayed for her friend who recently had surgery, and everyone else experiencing difficult times, as well as for an early end to the global pandemic.
 Watching the priests perform the purification rites, she felt as if she was at the shrine, Zama said. When one of the priests faced the screen and waved the _ōnusa_ sacred wand decorated with paper streamers, she bowed. It was like her prayers were answered, she said.
 "Wherever you are, I think it’s your feelings and thoughts, the wish to pray — that’s what’s important,” Zama said. "Whether online or offline, I don’t think it matters.”
 For Ono, praying in the sacred shrine is still better. He said he hoped people would visit the shrine for a real experience when it reopens. The shrine ended the online prayers last Sunday to prepare for its upcoming annual festival.
 Shinto is Japan’s indigenous religion that dates back centuries. The term means "the way of kami,” which refers to Shinto gods or spirits. It includes features of animism, in which sacred spirits are believed to reside in living things and aspects of nature, including wind, rain, mountains, trees, rivers and fertility.
 Purification is key to Shinto rituals, in order to keep away evil spirits. Worshipers can also make wishes for traffic safety, good health, success in business or exams, safe childbirth and many other things.
 There are about 80,000 shrines in Japan. Revered as the most sacred is Ise Shrine in central Japan that venerates the sun goddess Amaterasu, the mythological ancestor of the emperor.
 Not everyone in the conservative religion agrees with the departure from the traditional in-person prayers.
 But Naomi Shiba tweeted six prayers to the online shrine, hoping for an early end to the pandemic, for her two sons to be able to resume their work and studies, and for herself to lose some weight.
 "Perhaps this is the way to do it in the current age,” she said.

It was very interesting to me, and I think very important to everybody creatively involved, that this episode was not going to be an opportunity to show how being a liberal is the way to be, and that you can take a person who had a very narrow view of the world and put her in an environment that is expansive. She was able to really be present and bear witness to all of that. And she is different because of it. But it’s not an opportunity to say, “Oh, I see the light, and now I reject everything I have ever been taught, told, or believed in.” It’s just more of an assimilation or an integration of what she’s seen, because these women were only, in her mind, the enemy. They were trying to take something away from her that she valued, which was her place in the home. And that’s what she felt this [ERA] movement was about. And she had a limited understanding of it because oftentimes we only feed our brains and our hearts the things that support the things that we already think. I think she was absolutely a victim of that, at her own hand. But once she has seen for herself that the women on the feminist side are human beings with their own wants and desires and feelings that are as integral to their sense of self as hers are, it is impossible for her to go forward and not remember that. But it’s not a big jump to Alice having her eyes opened and now she’s a liberal. I don’t think that’s what happens there.

"When we want to implement this beating, we must bear in mind the following: First of all, the man must be sure that his wife is the kind of woman who may be reformed by beating. Second, if he has to beat her, he must not break her bones or cut her skin. Third, he must not beat her in front of her children, and he must not accompany the beating with rebuke, curses, or verbal offenses. If the beating is excessive, and harm is done to her body, the judge might punish the husband and sentence him to be lashed."

Initially posited in 2015, the ECB's Vison20/20 project for the harmonisation and integration of European cash and securities settlement services represents a major upheaval for European banks.      However, the pressures caused by the ongoing pandemic and Swift's recent move to delay the timetable for the introduction of the new ISO 20022 messaging standard respresent major roadblocks to the consolidation effort.      The call for a slowdown to the work comes in a letter to the ECB co-signed by The European Banking Federation, European Savings Bank Group, European Association of Co-operative Banks and European Association of Public Banks.      "In light of recent developments, we urge the ECB to consider a delay of one year in the consolidation project and to bring the deadline to November 2022," the trade bodies write, pointing to the severe constraints on bank resources from Covid-19.      Furthermore, Swift's postponement of the switchover to ISO 20022 will require all affected parties to reconsider their cross border payments strategy and re-engineer their internal projects, concept and documentation to deal with the mismatch of message types being introduced.      "Given the advanced T2-T2S consolidation project status, the decision has to be made as soon as possible in order to allow the market to take time to conduct a proper analysis of the different options available rather than rush into individualised solutions leading to possible unexpected effects on clients and the wider community," the letter states.      "Since the implementation is to be by means of a 'big bang', failure is not an option which means that the project is dependent on the weakest link in the chain being ready notwithstanding any unexpected and unforeseen events for which adequate contingency is considered to be essential," the paper concludes.

Coy Dean Reel passed from this life into eternal life at his residence in Hood River, Ore., while surrounded by family after a long battle with cancer on May 10, 2020, at the age of 85 years young.
 Coy came into the world on Jan. 28, 1935, in Peggs, Okla., to Eva and Herb Reel. Coy was shortly followed into this life by his now late siblings, Gaylord and Loretta. During the earlier years, the family had packed up and traveled to California, looking for a new life. This is where Coy had come to meet beautiful and young Dolly Waller. On Sept. 2, 1955, Coy married Dolly and they had lived many happy years together in California before eventually coming up and settling in Hood River, where they would come to put down roots into the community. Coy and Dolly had four children, Cheryl Wiggins (Steve), Brenda Schweller (Alan), Pamela “Gail” Midland and Curtis Reel, followed by eight grandkids and seven great-grandchildren.
 Coy has always encouraged and promoted freedom by the way he had lived his life. Everyone of Coy’s family members can recall times in which he would serenade them with either a guitar or a harmonica in his hand, working on becoming the next Hank Williams. If there was one thing Coy loved more than his music, it was his dogs. You would often find him up in the woods with his best hunting dogs, enjoying the freedom that nature brings. On the off chance that he was neither playing music or hanging in the woods, you would surely find him with either a fishing pole or a bottle of booze in his hands.
 Coy is and will always be remembered fondly by his friends and family as the one who lived by the words he had spoken. The family has decided to not have a service, but rather will have a celebration of life at a later date.
 Arrangements are under the direction of Anderson's Tribute Center (Funerals • Receptions • Cremations), 1401 Belmont Ave., Hood River. Visit www.AndersonsTributeCenter.com to leave a note of condolence for the family.

Marc, it’s also great to see that the marketplace has grown faster. So some of the things we were trying to get done over a period of time have accelerated as a result of what's happened during this period. But there are several things Paul I’d be keeping an eye on. At the end of this, it's about really healthy top-line with a strong mix represented not just consumable items at low margin, delivered through any means they want, through our stores if that's the most efficient route, straight from FCs if that's the most efficient route, and that's the math that we work with underneath.

The Wilmington Fire Department is requesting $12,800 from city council to purchase ballistic vests.
   
 An agreement with the Wilmington Police Department, New Hanover County Sheriff's Office and local emergency medical technicians (EMTs) requires each entity to acquire vests for their employees.
   
 "Back in 2015, a policy was adopted in the department," said WFD spokeswoman Natosha Tew. "The multi-agency high threats response plan identified the need of bulletproof vests."
   
 Deputy Chief Jon Mason said the vests are "strictly for EMS or medical assistance to a shooting or a stabbing incident."
   
 All firefighters are EMTs, said Mason, "so we've been responding to gunshot calls, shooting and stabbing accidents."
   
 According to Tew, fire departments across the country have been taking this step in recent years in light of recent events.
   
 "In an active school-shooter situation, we would be responding," Tew said.
   
 Mason echoed this, emphasizing that EMTs are sometimes placed in dangerous situations.
   
 "Often times we're the first arriving on scene," he said.
   
 Julian March, a spokesman for the New Hanover Regional Medical Center, said ballistic vests are issued to each EMS unit.
   
 "EMS procedure says a vest should be worn when there is an increased risk of firearm violence," he wrote in an email. "This could include responding to a potentially high-risk situation, such as scenes involving reported shooting or domestic violence."
   
 Mason said the WFD will buy 60 vests to cover each employee on a given shift.
   
 "Police officers have a softer type vests to wear underneath their uniform," he said. "Our's would be a plate carrier, heavy over top of uniform, which would be clearly marked fire and have a different color.
   
 Mason said the vests could "stop handgun ammunition and take a rifle round."
   
 The budget item was recommended at Wilmington City Council's May 12 meeting. Council will vote on a proposed 2020-21 budget on June 16.

A number of politicians have received flak for comparing the risk of driving to resuming daily life during the COVID-19 pandemic, the most recent being U.S. Sen. David Perdue of Georgia.
 In some ways, the pushback makes sense. The death tolls aren’t comparable and motor vehicles aren’t contagious, so reducing risk works differently.
 However, there are ways in which they are the same.
 Whether you are climbing in your car to drive or you walk into a crowded store, there is an assumed risk. If you stay at home, you are much less likely to get into a car wreck or contract COVID-19.
 Beyond that assumed risk, there is personal responsibility. We have a responsibility not to endanger others. If you’re drunk, you shouldn’t climb in the driver’s seat. If you’re sick, you shouldn’t go to crowded public places.
 State governments have actually codified personal responsibility for drivers. You can receive a ticket if you’re caught speeding, following too closely or ignoring the painted lines because of the danger it causes to others. If you don’t wear your seat belt, you can be fined because of the danger it causes to you. And if you’re caught driving while impaired or you cause serious injury, you can face jail time.
 That is for driving, which is a privilege — at least if you are driving on a road that you likely helped pay to pave. There aren’t laws in place requiring people to wear masks or stay home when they are sick, and such statutes could prove problematic.
 However, it shouldn’t take legislation to get people to act responsibly. That means there are things you should do to keep from spreading COVID-19.
 A big one is staying home if you are sick, especially if you might have COVID-19. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, it took just two people showing up sick at an Arkansas church to spread COVID-19 to 35 members of the congregation, killing three of them. Even if you are in the majority and are unlikely to face serious illness from this virus, you don’t know who you could end up contracting COVID-19 from you if you get it and don’t stay home.
 While you _should_ follow other CDC guidelines — frequent hand-washing, keeping 6 feet between you and people you don’t live with, and wearing a mask when you can’t practice social distancing — you can judge which risks you are willing to take. However, bear in mind that there are people who are following those guidelines, including those who are more at risk for serious illness, and you should respect that. And if you live with someone who is older or has underlying conditions, remember that they share the risks you take.
 In other words, be respectful of others and don’t turn _your_ risks into _their_ risks.
 This is you as an individual, not as an employee or a business owner. If you are required to abide by certain guidelines at work, either from your company or from the government, you should generally follow them. And if you are patronizing a business, you agree to follow its rules when you enter.
 And for all the people out there who say that we wouldn’t stay at home to prevent driving deaths, you are absolutely right, we wouldn’t and shouldn’t. However, staying at home has been effective at preventing driving deaths, even it was was unintentional. According to the state Department of Public Safety, in the past four years, we were at 360 to 400 traffic deaths as a state by this point in the year. As of Monday, South Carolina had just 284 for 2020. That’s down by about 25% — and we only hunkered down for a little more than a third of that time.

Arsenal are being linked with a move to sign Justin Kluivert from Roma this summer, but who is he?
 I struggle to believe that any of you will not recognise that footballing surname, and he is of course the son of legend Patrick Kluivert, who had an amazing goalscoring record for both Barcelona and Holland.
 Justin has some way to live up to the family name, but at 21 years-old he is showing plenty of promise, and has already established himself as a regular starter for both Roma and Ajax previously.
 Young Kluivert plays predominantly on the left wing, but has featured on either flank and is more than competent at using either boot.
 We are said to be considering a move for Justin as part of the deal to send Henrikh Mkhitaryan to Roma this summer, and I warn you now, this highlight reel below will get you a little excited.
 The former Ajax youth product is one of the best dribblers out there, and is still a raw talent that could be honed into a truly top player.
 Would Kluivert be a great addition to our young and exciting squad? Who would be most threatened in the Arsenal squad at his arrival?

But Grossman said that while “Japan and other allies have got to be worried about U.S. military readiness … there are many other signs of a still-strong and sustained U.S. military presence in the region.”
 He cited back-to-back U.S. freedom of navigation operations near Chinese-held islands in the South China Sea last month, as well as the simultaneous sailing of the USS America, an amphibious assault ship loaded with F-35B short-takeoff and vertical-landing fighter jets, ostensibly for training in the strategic waterway — part of what he said was a concerted effort “to confront Chinese assertiveness.”
 “As much as allies and partners may worry about U.S. sustainability in the region, thus far, there is little evidence to suggest much has changed for the worse,” Grossman said, “Quite the contrary, the U.S. military seems to be paying more attention to the Indo-Pacific than usual.”
 Indeed, the U.S. Navy has been unusually vocal in publicly conveying its operations and training in the western Pacific in recent weeks.
 In one particularly surprising move, the Pacific Fleet even took the rare step on May 8 of announcing that all of its forward-deployed submarines were at sea conducting operations "in support of a free and open Indo-Pacific region amidst the pandemic." A day later, the 7th Fleet said that three subs had joined ships and aircraft for “a joint advanced warfighting training exercise” from May 2 to 8 in the Philippine Sea.
 And in what was widely seen as a response to the Chinese dispatch of government vessels near the West Capella, the 7th Fleet also deployed two advanced littoral combat ships for separate “presence operations” near the drillship.
 In addition to the navy’s operations, the U.S. Air Force has also beefed up its missions in the region.
 Although after 16 years it wrapped up its “continuous bomber presence” of rotating heavy bombers through the island of Guam for long durations, the U.S. Air Force has in recent weeks flown B-1B bombers in the area as part of its “unpredictable” new “dynamic force employment” missions.
 Over the last month, it has heavily publicized five B-1B training missions over the East China Sea as well as one off northern Japan involving a whopping six U.S. Air Force F-16 fighters, seven Air Self-Defense Force F-2s and eight ASDF F-15s.

 Since the coronavirus began early in April, local Realtors have been pushing lawmakers to be considered an essential business. Previously, businesses and employees in the real estate industry were permitted to conduct limited in- person activities in counties in the yellow phase of the commonwealth’s phased reopening plan.

Doch das ist nur Plan B, kommen wir zuruck zu Plan A und den drei neuen Serien. Dabei handelt es sich um "B Positive", "The Equalizer" und "Clarice". "B Positive" ist eine Multicamera-Sitcom, hinter der Multicamera-Spezialist Chuck Lorre steckt - der gemeinsam mit "Young Sheldon" und "Mom" dann drei der vier Sitcom-Platze am Donnerstagabend bespielen wird. Thomas Middleditch spielt darin Drew, einen Therapeuten und alleinerziehenden Vater, der eine neue Niere braucht. Er trifft auf Gina (Annaleigh Ashford), eine ruppige Frau aus seiner Vergangenheit, die sich als Spenderin anbietet. Sie beginnen eine so unwahrscheinliche wie lebensbejahende Freundschaft, die das Leben beider fur immer verandern wird. Zweiter Neustart im Herbst ist "The Equalizer", eine Neuauflage der gleichnamigen Serie aus den 80ern. Diesmal ist der heimliche Held, der bescheiden auftritt aber mit seinen außergewohnlichen Fahigkeiten Menschen in Not hilft und Gerechtigkeit wieder herstellt, aber weiblich und wird von Queen Latifah dargestellt. Erst 2021 wird man "Clarice" zu sehen bekommen. Die Geschichte setzt sechs Monate nach den Ereignissen aus dem Film "Das Schweigen der Lammer" ein und erzahlt die personliche Geschichte von FBI- Agentin Clarice Starling (Rebecca Breeds).

BELOIT — The Beloit Public Library (BPL) has taken advantage of its doors being closed during the Safer At Home order to upgrade to Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) tags.
 Over the past three weeks, staff have spent approximately 1,600 hours working to apply and activate the new tags on every item in its 160,000-piece collection. RFID tags use electromagnetic fields to automatically identify and track objects and will eventually replace the need for barcodes.
 The library has been closed since March 16 due to the state’s Safer At Home order. Conducting this project during closure has had its advantages.
 “Tagging items while closed has been a benefit because materials haven’t been moving on and off of our shelves like they would have, had we been open,” said BPL Head of Library Resources Michael DeVries. “We also have been able to dedicate more staff time to getting this project done quicker —a few weeks rather than a few months.”
 Beloit Public Library, along with 28 other libraries in the SHARE Consortium, are upgrading to RFID tags to improve the speed and accuracy with which items are processed. The end result will be materials moving into the hands of patrons more quickly and without as much physical contact for staff behind the scenes.
 Patrons also will notice a difference in the time that it takes to check out. One entire stack of books can be checked out in a matter of seconds, compared with the time it takes to scan traditional barcodes, one at a time. In the current health crisis, it also means materials are being touched less.
 The RFID project is possible thanks to funding from Arrowhead Library System, as well as a 2020 SHARE RFID Adoption Grant from the Lakeshores Library System.
 Eight libraries applied for the Lakeshores RFID grant. Beloit Public Library and Rochester Public Library were chosen. Arrowhead Library System, of which BPL is a member library, also contributed funds toward Beloit’s tagging project.

The only other thing I would add Karen, we have seen higher growth rates, most customers who are 50 years of age or older than what we had seen in previous quarters. Other than that it's been across the board, the repeat rates have been higher. And I think it's a real strength of the organization to be able to enlist so many stores to help fulfill like we did in the quarter. I think only Walmart could turn on 2,500 stores to fulfilling customer orders as quickly as we did. So I’d just like to thank our team for being able to do that.

Some physicians misuse their credentials. Earlier this year, Dr. Drew (Drew Pinsky) beat the CV-19 media hoax drum telling Fox News' Laura Ingraham the problem "will not be the virus." Pinsky later issued a mea culpa apologizing and admitting he now wears a mask in public. It's never too late to do the right thing. When my friend Carolyn McClanahan speaks, I listen, but Dr. Drew not so much.

Lo stesso vale per il centrodestra, che punta tutto sulla scarcerazione dei mafiosi e sulle violentissime rivolte che si sono verificate nelle carceri, ma parla anche di prescrizioni e intercettazioni.

Nines, also referred to as the "easygoing" type, will want to go with the flow. At a restaurant, they might even order the same thing as you just to keep the peace. For agreeable nines, a plant-based curry chickpea salad will hit the spot. Just like this personality type, this recipe is easy to make and can pair with almost anything. Crackers, naan bread, sandwiches you name it.

 CSU-Landesgruppenchef Alexander Dobrindt hat den 500 Milliarden Euro schweren deutsch-französischen Wiederaufbauplan zur Erholung der EU nach der Corona- Krise zurückhaltend bewertet. Der Vorschlag von Kanzlerin Angela Merkel (CDU) und dem französischen Präsidenten Emmanuel Macron „kann ein Weg sein, um die europäische Solidarität und den Zusammenhalt zur Bewältigung der Corona-Krise zu stärken“, teilte Dobrindt am Dienstag in Berlin mit. „Wir werden uns die Details genau anschauen, wollen den Weg aber konstruktiv begleiten.“ Der Plan braucht nicht nur Einstimmigkeit innerhalb der EU, auch der Bundestag muss zustimmen.
 \n
 Der Schwerpunkt der Hilfen solle auf den Themen Investitionen und Innovationen liegen, betonte Dobrindt. „Es kann keinesfalls darum gehen, nationale Haushalte durch Corona-Hilfsmaßnahmen zu sanieren.“ Ziel der CSU sei eine solidarische Lösung in Europa. „Entscheidend dabei ist, dass sich die Lösung innerhalb der bestehenden europäischen Verträge abbilden lässt, die nationalen Parlamente die Entscheidungen tragen und keine neuen Kompetenzen für Brüssel wie beispielsweise ein europäisches Steuerrecht begründet werden.“ Nach erster Betrachtung bewege sich der Vorstoß innerhalb der EU-Verträge.

We did suspend the NCIB program at the end of March in light of the market activity. We've got a conservative prudent approach to risk management, which has served us well.

And from an outlook perspective, no, it is actually what I said I think this is by the substantial economic crisis and we’re discussing COVID and that’s the first step of the equation, but then it is quite some burden on healthcare, on governments. It is also an impact to people in how they perceive their willingness to spend significant amounts and we just don’t have the answer, but there tends to be some compression in our industry if you go back to 2008 or 2009 where you can say look over the years after it was muted we were not in the 6% to 7% growth rates at that point of time. So I think it’s just – I think it’s something to keep in mind, we still have 75% to 80% as out of pocket pay right.

For Rand’s Grossman, the common refrain that Beijing is exploiting the pandemic for geopolitical gain is simply overblown.
 “Its actions in places like the South China Sea and near Taiwan are simply a continuation of past assertive behavior,” he said.
 Whatever the case, the U.S. military has promoted the view that it is on the mend — and looking to return to a steadier foothold in the western Pacific.
 Last Thursday, navy pilots began nearly a month of carrier landing practice on Iwo Jima to qualify for the Reagan’s upcoming patrol, while the navy’s top medical officer told CNN that he is “very confident” the virus-hit Roosevelt is “medically ready” to return to action.
 The carrier is expected to leave port later this week, nearly two months after it was sidelined in Guam.
 And what about the navy’s top officer, Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Michael Gilday? He is continuing his self-quarantine, and currently working from home.

But I’m sure there are some much more intelligent people than me that will know what it will take for us to be able to do as a team, be on the field, interact with one another and resume things the way that we had them but with some adaptations. I think that all will be settled once they start diving into this a little bit deeper.”

While the impact of Covid-19 and other such viruses can’t be fully minimised or eradicated in the absence of an effective vaccine, Whelan’s plan for the redevelopment of DIT’s former Kevin Street campus has been future-proofed by architects, Henry J Lyons, to allow the occupiers of its office space to respond quickly to changes in business practices such as headcount growth and contraction, new ways of working necessitated by phenomena such as Covid-19, and changes in team sizes.
