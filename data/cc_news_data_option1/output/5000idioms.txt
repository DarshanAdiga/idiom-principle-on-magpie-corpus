He said when it comes to the clients, the horses help bring peace to their chaotic world.
 Wasatch Crest offers an on-the-ground form of equine therapy. There is no riding involved, instead the therapeutic services involve walking, grooming and bridling the horses.
 “This takes therapy out of the office,” McDonald said.
 McDonald is a strong believer in the connection of being outdoors to find quiet peace and inner strength. McDonald said most, if not all, of his clients with addiction, particularly drug addictions, have sought the services of various therapies and therapists before coming to Wasatch Crest.
 Wasatch Crest staff is comprised of about 30 team members, including clinicians, recovery advocates and business development. The team of about seven clinicians includes a medical director, director of nursing and director of recreational therapy.
 “They (clients) know what to say to a therapist,” McDonald said. “This (equine therapy) takes the talking out of it.”
 Meaning, according to McDonald, clients don’t feel the need to perform or hide parts of themselves to a therapist. McDonald said he was a skeptic about equine therapy before he saw it work.
 “It blew me away,” McDonald said. “It’s really good for clients who need a different approach.”
 Most clients McDonald supports have lost trust, not just in themselves but in society in general. They show hard exteriors, but when they become invested in the animals, there is give and take.

The assassination of Black Panther Illinois Chairman Fred Hampton was brought up briefly in _The Trial of the Chicago 7_, but one of the most shocking events (and what led to it) in the City of Chicago in the second half of the 20th Century will be examined thoroughly in the upcoming drama _Judas and the Black Messiah_. In the upcoming Shaka King-directed project, Daniel Kaluuya will play the late Fred Hampton leading up to his murder following an FBI investigation that involved Williams O'Neal (Lakeith Stanfield), a criminal- turned-informant who went undercover in the Black Panther Party. _Judas and the Black Messiah_ was originally supposed to come out on August 20, 2020, but it is now being released at some point in 2021.

"È una grande squadra come l'Inter ma in questo campionato devi giocarti tutte le partite. Noi abbiamo perso punti in casa con squadre che stanno sotto di noi e magari contro il Napoli che è più forte di noi abbiamo vinto. Il campionato è ancora molto equilibrato. Con la Roma non è una partita con le altre ma non vuol dire che non possiamo fare risultato. Non voglio entrare nei discorsi di altre squadre, credo che la sconfitta di Napoli sia stata un'incidente di percorso come è capitato a tutte tranne al Milan. La Roma comunque rimane una squadra forte con giocatori forte e una forte identità, è da prendere come una grande squadra perché lo è a tutti gli effetti".

When foreign markets closed their doors to seafood imports during the COVID-19 pandemic, B.C. fisheries suffered huge losses this year. Some sympathetic consumers here at home abandoned the cheaper, farmed products from other countries to pay a little more for fresh, locally sourced wild catches, as suppliers and retailers identified new ways of getting that seafood on the shelf.

Moscow, which currently accounts for about a quarter of the country's new daily infections, moved ahead of the curve, opening 70 vaccination facilities on Saturday. Doctors, teachers and municipal workers were invited to book a time to receive a jab, and Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said that about 5,000 signed up in a few hours after the system began operating on Friday.
 Russia boasted that Sputnik V was the world's "first registered COVID-19 vaccine" after the government gave it regulatory approval in early August. The move drew criticism from international experts, who pointed out that the vaccine had only been tested on several dozen people at the time.
 Putin has shrugged off doubts about it, saying in August that one of his daughters was among the early vaccine recipients.
 Over the past months, Sputnik V has been offered to medical workers and teachers even as it was still in the middle of advanced trials. Several top officials said they also have received the jabs, and earlier this week the Russian military began vaccinating crews of navy ships scheduled to depart on a mission.
 Health Minister Mikhail Murashko said Wednesday that more than 100,000 people in Russia already have received the shots.
 The free vaccine is offered to people aged 18 to 60 who don't suffer from chronic illnesses and aren't pregnant or breastfeeding.
 The two-shot Sputnik V was developed by the Moscow-based Gamaleya Institute. An advanced study among 40,000 volunteers was announced two weeks after the vaccine received government approval and that is still ongoing.
 Last month, developers of the vaccine said interim analysis of trial data showed it was 91.4% effective. The conclusion was based on 39 infections among 18,794 study participants that received both doses of either the vaccine or a placebo, which is a much lower number of infections than Western drugmakers have looked at when assessing the effectiveness of their vaccines. Two other Russia-designed vaccines are also undergoing tests.
 On Wednesday, Britain became the first country in the West to authorize the use of a vaccine against the coronavirus developed by U.S. drugmaker Pfizer and Germany's BioNTech.

China and the United States need to proceed together with "good will" to improve relations, the Chinese ambassador to Washington said on Saturday, as ties remained fraught between the world's two biggest economic powers. Sino-US relations have fallen to their lowest point in decades over issues from trade and security to human rights and Covid-19. On Friday, a Chinese state media editorial said ties are being shifted to "a dangerous path"."In order to put the relations on the right track, to have real improvement of the relations, both sides have to proceed with good will and good faith," Ambassador Cui Tiankai told the Annual Conference of the Institute for China-America Studies via video link. "I don't think that China should just do something to please anybody here," he said, according to a transcript posted on his embassy's website. Tensions between the two countries dramatically escalated in July when China closed the US consulate in the southwestern city of Chengdu in retaliation for Beijing's ouster from its consulate in Houston, Texas.Also Read | US suspends exchange programs with China, calling them 'propaganda'Earlier in the year, Washington cut the number of Chinese nationals allowed to work at the US offices of major Chinese state media. Beijing then expelled US journalists in the China bureaus of New York Times, Wall Street Journal and the Washington Post.POSITIVE GESTURES When asked by President of the National Committee on United States-China Relations Steve Orlins if China is prepared to reopen the Chengdu consulate among other positive gestures before President-elect Joe Biden takes office in January, Cui did not rule out the possibility. "I have to say we did not initiate the closing of consulates. We were not the first one to ask foreign journalists to leave the country. We did all these things in response to actions taken by the United States. So if the US government is ready to reverse the course, we are ready to look at it," Cui said. But, Orlins said, Beijing had unilaterally taken measures against US interests, including the blocking of the three newspapers' websites, as well as Facebook, Google, YouTube and Twitter, and that Washington had not responded to those actions. "There were provocations. If you look at what happened in the past year or so," Cui replied.
