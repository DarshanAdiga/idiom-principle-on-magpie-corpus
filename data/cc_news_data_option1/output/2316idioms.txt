Promising to initiate an “unprecedented development” process in the next five years in J&K, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on Sunday said people in Pakistan Occupied Kashmir (PoK) will soon will prefer India over Pakistan after watching the progress on this side.
 Addressing BJP leaders and workers in a virtual Jan Samvad, Mr Singh said, “Development is our priority. In the coming five years, we will change the future of J&K and PoK residents would envy it too. People in PoK will also raise their voice and will prefer to live in India's J&K, not with Pakistan.” He also highlighted the opening up of six new medical colleges, two central universities in the Union Territories.

 Referring to the standoff in eastern Ladakh, the Minister said the dialogue on military and the diplomatic channels were underway to resolve the issue on the Line of Actual Control (LAC).
 “Military and diplomatic channels were open with China. China has also expressed desire to resolve the issue through a dialogue. We also believe that Indo-China tussle could be resolved through a dialogue at the military and the diplomatic levels,” Mr. Singh said.
 Referring to the opposition’s criticism over the issue, Mr Singh said the government would not keep the people or the Parliament in the dark about the developments in Ladakh.
 “We will divulge the details at an appropriate time,” he said. He assured the people of the country and the opposition parties that “there will be no compromise with national pride”.
 "India is strong, not weak. We are augmenting the security of the country," he added.
 On the revocation of Article 370 and J&K’s special status, Mr. Singh said even Muslim countries supported it, except Malaysia and Turkey.
 “Article 370 and Article 35-A were in our manifesto. Even the party workers were suspicious if the BJP will pursue the agenda. Under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, what we say, we do. PM Modi did it in the blink of an eye. We will not allow a crisis of credibility,” said Mr. Singh, while defending the move of reading down the Article 370 on August 5 last year.
 He said in the garb of the _azaadi_ (freedom) agitation, the Pakistani and the Islamic State flags were being unfurled in Kashmir. “But, only the national flag is being hosted in Kashmir now,” he said, adding “Kashmiriyat is about the coexistence of the Hazratbal shrine and the Baba Barfani (Amarnath shrine).”
 On the national news channels telecasting the temperature of Muzaffarabad and Gilgit, Mr. Singh said, "There might be changes in Islamabad (Pakistan) with the temperature readings. That is why it's bent upon doing some mischievous acts. But our defence forces, paramilitary, intelligence and J&K Police are giving befitting response to their activities in J&K.”

Perhaps if the symbol were a unique flower, or hybrid, that could be planted anywhere, to represent the beauty and strength of humanity. A symbol that could be a reminder in front of schools, houses, religious buildings, business buildings, farms and buildings that have an official presence in a community. Whatever the symbol, it would have to be one that could stand the test of time and be recognized as a representation of the requirements of belonging to the human race. A powerful and yet delicate symbol for it must dictate to and guide the human heart. Another part of being human, often affected by the hurts of the historical past and all too current present impressions and beliefs. Here is where the symbol needs to remind all of us that our being on this earth requires the best in us as humans, as we interact with each other. Without that best: compassion, forgiveness, reasoning, patience, courage, forbearance, etc., we gradually lessen our humanness. Dooming ourselves to just be; to exist without the difference being fully human can make and develop – instead, a life diminished and less capable of love, friendship, and a peace-filled society and world.

Danny Green says NBA, union talks on restart "very up in the air right now"

Britain is marking the third anniversary of the Grenfell Tower apartment block fire with a virtual church service to remember the 72 people who died in the blaze.
 Sunday marks three years since a small kitchen fire in the west London public- housing block turned into the worst domestic blaze in the country since World War II.
 The fire spread rapidly and engulfed the 24-story building, shocking the nation and prompting a widespread investigation into low-cost, flammable cladding at high-rise buildings.
 “As a nation, we are still dealing with the consequences of what happened and working to make sure it never happens again,” Prime Minister Boris Johnson said in a video message to be shown at an online commemoration service.
 For all the latest headlines follow our Google News channel online or via the app.
 In tribute to each victim who died in the fire, the bells of London churches will toll 72 times and green lights will glow from tower block windows to show solidarity with survivors and the bereaved.
 A public inquiry into the disaster was paused in March because of the coronavirus pandemic and is due to restart in July.
 Police have said that no one is likely to face criminal charges until 2021.

Some local child care providers are daunted by the state's reopening guidelines, saying that while they understand the need to be safe during the pandemic, the new regulations will limit their ability to serve families.
 At least one center operator said she can't envision reopening under those new rules, which were announced by the state last week.
 "No one's going to be able to do it - there's no way," said Ann Latino, director of Miss Betty's Step in Time Daycare Center in Worcester, who added the regulations for older students, who cannot be in groups larger than 10 and must remain with the same staff members each day, is particularly challenging. "That means no floaters - (staff) won't even be able to go to the bathroom."
 Like schools and colleges, child care centers and preschools in Massachusetts had to shut down to most families in mid-March, when the coronavirus pandemic took hold of the state. The only exceptions were children of emergency workers, who were still allowed to attend specially licensed centers.
 Earlier this spring, Gov. Charlie Baker set a target of June 29 for centers to begin reopening to the general populace, and on June 1 unveiled the guidelines for doing so.

Head over to MetroWestDailyNews.com to sign up for the Coronavirus newsletter and make sure you never miss a thing. You pick the news you want, we deliver.
 For many small private child care providers around the region, however, it may be too late to reopen, said William Eddy, executive director of the Massachusetts Association of Early Education and Care in Worcester.
 "Their entire revenue streams went away" in March, he said. "Those programs are under tremendous stress right now, and some quite frankly won't be coming back."
 Some centers that are partially subsidized by the government, meanwhile - meaning they receive funding to take in lower-income children, children under the care of the state, and other vulnerable populations - will also be hard- pressed to meet some of the state's guidelines, some of which are "grim, just grim," Eddy said.
 But he also said the updated regulations are necessary to get the state's child care and preschool system back to some semblance of what it was before the virus.
 "The emergency care (offered the past few months) has not been to their usual standards," Eddy said, adding Massachusetts normally has some of the most stringent standards in the country for early childhood education. "(Emergency care) has been effective, it's been necessary, but it's not the system parents are used to for their students."
 Linda Cavaioli, executive director of the YWCA Central Massachusetts, and Darlene Belliveau, the organization's Director of Children's Services, said they can appreciate the state's strict reopening requirements as the world continues to face down a still mysterious and deadly disease.
 "I think it's based on data," Belliveau said. "Can we accept them, health and safety wise? Yes."
 But whether the YWCA's two early education and care centers in Worcester and Westborough can financially weather the new regulations is another story, they said.
 "To be perfectly honest, we're in the process of trying to do a year-end estimate," Cavaioli said. "We're not sure if we'll be able to break even with this … we're trying to figure out who's going to show up (once the centers reopen on a non-emergency basis in July), and if we're able to make a go of it."
 One of the main problems facing their centers, they said, is the square footage requirement per child, which will increase to 42 square feet under the updated guidelines. That means the Worcester center will have to accept 43 fewer students than normal, while the Westborough center will have to accept 24 fewer, according to Cavaioli and Belliveau, leaving many of their usual clients without a placement for their child this summer.
 Under the emergency care regulations, in comparison, the state "was a little bit laxer on the ratios," Cavaioli said.
 Yet the YWCA didn't have any instances of students, who had to submit to temperature screenings every morning, getting sick from COVID-19 over the past three months they said. That was also the case at Miss Betty's, said Latino, who wondered why the state couldn't just continue with the current emergency care guidelines going forward.
 "Why do the regulations have to change so drastically?" she said, when centers like hers have been able to make their operations work this spring.
 Child care and preschool providers are hopeful the reopening regulations will not be in place for long, assuming the pandemic continues to wind down and centers are eventually able to go back to more normal operations this fall.
 But in the meantime, they're worried about not being able to help parents who are now gradually getting back to their regular work routines - "our mission is absolutely critical," Cavaioli said.

The estimated buildout will last 12 years. The original plan called for the corporate office to span 500,000 square feet. A 1,500-unit senior living and transitional housing development would be 2.5 million square feet. Another 3.4 million square feet would be reserved for mixed-use retail and hotels. At full buildout, the project now called Redtail Ridge, could generate in the ballpark of $24 million in annual real estate taxes, according to Brue Baukol.

10/10 GPAs galore
 This is the first time in the history of SSC exams that the results will not be declared since there is no question of judging who all passed or failed because the State government has decided to promote all Class X students automatically due to lockdown. As a consequence, there will not be supplementary exams.
 The sole interest was now focussed on grades achieved by children on the basis of their performance in internal assessments conducted in schools.
 Of the 5.35 lakh children who enrolled for the exams, nearly 3.75 lakh were from private schools which were blamed for awarding internal assessment marks to their children at free will. It was said that they awarded 20 out of a maximum of 20 marks in each subject to 1.5 lakh students. Since there is a weightage of 20 marks for internal assessment, as many marks are multiplied five times for the overall grade points in each subject. The grade point average for all these students was likely to be 10/10.
 Leaders forced to keep away
 The surge in number of coronavirus cases has apparently created a panic among elected representatives.
 With some of them testing positive for the virus, ministers and MLAs are taking care to avoid mass contact not to give scope for contacting the virus. Some ministers are going ahead in asking the people not to meet them directly and instead, represent their grievances over telephone. Elected representatives of Warangal resolved unanimously in this regard and assured people of their constituencies that arrangements will be put in place to receive their grievances round-the-clock.
 It is indeed a tough decision taken by them because politicians prefer to be among people all the time, especially at a time when solutions to crying problems did not appear in near future.
 Make hay while sun shines!
 At a time when there’s large-scale retrenchment in private sector due to severe slowdown of the economy under the impact of COVID-19, some blessed ones in the public (government) sector are getting extension of services even after their attainment of superannuation age. With the help of their reach in the corridors of power such individuals are getting extension of service denying senior positions to those down the line or an opportunity to the unemployed youth waiting for recruitment to fill those vacancies. Although there are several bureaucrats and other officials clinging on to one post or the other, including the role of advisors even after retirement, the classic example is that of an engineer holding a key position in the Irrigation Department who has been getting extension after extension since July 2013. Another senior irrigation engineer who was in-charge of executing the head works of one the two most spoken about projects in Telangana was denied extension of service mid-way through execution of works in spite of his “commendable” work. More recently, a lecturer in Higher Education Department and another official in Excise Department were given extension of three years each as their kin are office-bearers of an employees’ association and have close ties with political bosses.
 Hopes of transfer in police department were raised once again as some officials are slated to retire by the end of this month. At least five senior officers, including Warangal Police Commissioner V. Ravinder, Special Investigation Branch chief T. Prabhakar Rao, State Police Housing Corporation Managing Director B. Malla Reddy, Cyberabad Joint Commissioner A. Venkateshwar Rao and Nirmal Superintendent of Police C. Shashidhar Raju, are demitting their office.
 With this, several officers are hoping that they will get new assignments. The grapevine is that at least two superintendents of police from north Telangana and one from West Zone are likely to find a place in three urban commissionerates, while a few deputy commissioners of police posted in Cyberabad and Rachakonda are hoping of getting transferred to districts. Moreover, the aspirants for promotion, especially Group-I officers from 2009 batch, are pulling the levers of power to find good placements.

“If you had any niggles in your body just to completely flush them out of your system. Train away but stay fresh. Match fitness will come. The mental side is the biggest benefit I've found. Just to get away from the game and re-energise yourself.”
 His take is that this hiatus could well prove beneficial down the line.
 “Hopefully it will add a year or two to the end of my career as well. Some players have taken sabbaticals, some southern hemisphere guys over the years, and this is pretty much one of them. I have enjoyed it. It's been tough but you have to look at it in a positive way.”
 That positivity is shared by colleagues, coaches, and fans eager to see their new signings in competitive action, hopefully come the weekend of August 22nd when Johann van Graan's side are due to meet Leinster behind-closed-doors at the Aviva Stadium.
 Matt Gallagher is due to arrive soon from Saracens, Roman Salanoa has made the shorter trip down the road from Leinster, while RG Snyman and Damian De Allende have already arrived in Limerick after their World Cup-winning exploits last year and brief stints in the J League.
 “What they did at the World Cup was really special. Obviously envious of it but incredible to see what they did. To have guys like that to come to our squad which has been there or thereabouts but just come up short in quite a few semi-finals ... and that's part of what I have been focusing on in my time off, is the club.
 “It is your bread and butter. Winning something would be... I have been very lucky over the years to win stuff with Ireland and go on a few Lions tours but, genuinely, winning something with Munster is something that is burning in me and something I really want to do. So I am delighted to see those two lads walking around Limerick.”
 There are other goals to attain when rugby kicks off again. Ireland have a 2020 Six Nations campaign to see to with outstanding fixtures to fulfill against France and Italy. The Lions are due to tour South Africa. When exactly has yet to be confirmed.

For players NBC Sports has spoken to in recent days, money also plays a significant factor in this decision. Players would be giving up paychecks from this season (something Howard, Irving, and McCollum can afford to do more easily than the 72% of players who make less than the league average salary). Plus, not playing would lead to a tearing up and renegotiating of the current CBA, and those negotiations during a pandemic would lead to the players certainly getting a smaller share of league revenue in the future.
