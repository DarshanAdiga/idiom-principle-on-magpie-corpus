Honestly, where is King James I when you need him?
 I like eating turkey and pie with friends and relations as much as the next person, but I will not be doing so this year because, my fellow Americans, this is a no-brainer. The first Thanksgiving was a celebration of survival. The people who gathered for that meal had lost friends and loved ones en masse, had been forced to live in ways that were difficult and sometimes only marginally successful, and had found themselves relying on people about whom they harbored many misconceptions and much mistrust.
 If we are going to share in their gratitude, could we please do it in a way that does not fly in the face of all the hardship they had to endure?
 Do you think any member of the Wampanoag or the Plymouth Colony would insist on some big feast if they knew it would result in more illness, more deaths? They lost children and parents and spouses and friends to diseases they could not even name, diseases that we can prevent with an inoculation or cure with pill. Imagine what they would have given for the knowledge we possess; imagine how horrified they would be at the notion of the country they helped found simply ignoring that knowledge because its citizens were tired of watching Netflix, of not being able to travel or have parties.

Everybody is just stretched," Welch said, "our housekeeping, they have to go in and clean those rooms thoroughly before we can put anybody else in on them."
 The University of Kansas Hospital broke records on Monday for the total number of hospitalized coronavirus patients, those in the ICU and the number of virus patients on ventilators, the Kansas City Star reported.
 The hospital had 139 COVID-19 patients, said Dana Hawkinson, medical director of infection prevention and control at The University of Kansas Health System.
 Of the 100 patients deemed active coronavirus cases, 46 are in the intensive care unit, and 26 of those in the ICU are on a ventilator, he said. In addition to those active cases, 39 other patients are in recovery at the hospital.
 Chuck Welch, vice president of the Hutchinson Regional Healthcare System, said his hospital has averaged about 30 COVID-19 patients since October, compared to about four in the months before -- an increase of more than 600%. Nurses have had to take about 10 shifts in a row, with less time off, Welch said.

A GAA afternoon that brought a glow to the skies transported an immortal line from the BBC‚Äôs golden age of sports broadcasting skidding across the years. As first Tipp and then Cavan staged miraculous, electrifying coups, it was as if the words of Barry Davies had been tailored on Saville Row, or by Louis Copeland himself, to fit a Sunday that can only have rolled off the production line in some fantasy factory.As a verbal portrait of euphoria, it is without flaw or kink.&quot;Look at his face, just look at his face,&quot; announces Davies after Franny Lee unleashes an unstoppable long- range missile that detonates in the Manchester City net.A nine-word masterpiece, Davies&rsquo;s voice cracking with emotion, and an instruction worth repeating after a day when the footballers of Cavan and Tipperary achieved something that will colour the rest of their lives. Look at the face of Cavan&rsquo;s Ciaran Brady as he dives into the embrace of his manager Mickey Graham.Look at the face of Tipp&rsquo;s returned Aussie exile Colin O&rsquo;Riordan.Look at the faces of every man in Breffni blue or Tipp&rsquo;s specially commissioned Bloody Sunday centenary shirt as the final whistle breaks down the Bastille gates.They are the faces of men set suddenly free from a lifetime of incarceration.Rapture; wonder; incredulity; gratitude; visceral, uncontainable convulsions frame their features.In their eyes, wide- open windows to their souls, is the overflowing ecstasy of liberation. Now, listen to their voices.O&rsquo;Riordan, the minor All-Ireland winner turned Aussie Rules star, back among his own after five years in the mighty harbour town of Sydney, going where no Tipp man has gone in 85 years, overwhelmed by the weight of the moment.Lost in its freakish beauty.His voice trembles like a skyscraper in an earthquake, the seismic impact of the shifting Munster football tectonic plates throwing him beautifully off-balance.It isn&rsquo;t what O&rsquo;Riordan says, though the words are persuasive and moving. It is his delivery. The genuineness that seeps from every sentence. The audience is given a ringside seat to the overwhelming power of that moment when an athlete touches his dream. His words are a quivering instrument, making the music of elation.&quot;This is an emotional day for me. A few weeks ago, I didn&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d be here. Just to be able to be out there with all the lads. Just giving your all for the sake of, for the sake of Tipperary. I can&rsquo;t put it into words. It&rsquo;s the best feeling. It&rsquo;s the best feeling I&rsquo;ve had for many years. It just fills me with pride so much. I get emotional even thinking about it.&quot;By this stage he&rsquo;s sniffling, shaking his head as if trying to clear his brain of the occasion&rsquo;s concussive magnitude.&ldquo;To me it&rsquo;s one of the best days of me life. This is not about Colin O&rsquo;Riordan coming up here to give interviews. This is about the boys out here‚Ä¶&rdquo;Here, he takes a deep breath, gasping for any lingering remnants of the composure that has long ago fled the scene. A granite-bodied sportsman, one in the very prime of his life, who, minutes ago, soared to catch a ball that finally broke Cork, is now as helpless as a new-born.&ldquo;To me, it just means so much to be able to put on the Tipp jersey. It is something I&rsquo;ll never ever take for granted. And something I&rsquo;ll respect until the day I die.&rdquo;Dignity and thanksgiving seep from every syllable. All those nights on the other side of the world, living the professional athlete&rsquo;s dream, but feeling the draw of his home place. Now here he is. With his own. Atop Everest.Some 240 miles away, Cavan will soon be transforming a little corner of Armagh into their own Theatre of Dreams.Graham was on the last Breffni squad to touch greatness back in 1997. Now, his ruddy face peeking out from beneath a woolly cap, he brings to mind a surfer amid a tsunami.Buffeted by this tidal wave of high achievement, impotent in the face of the mighty waves of emotion, his expression is as of the soil as any line from a poem composed by their Monaghan neighbour, Paddy Kavanagh.&quot;You got me at a bad time,&quot; he apologises to his interviewer, though, the truth is we have caught him at the perfect hour, all his uncontainable passions bursting from every pixel of the screen.&quot;I&rsquo;m just trying to catch me thoughts. What, what, what the lads, what can you say, it was just, they gave everything you can ask of a team. Honesty, guts, determination, belief, while nobody else had it, they had it. I&rsquo;m just delighted for them.&quot;Asked about the impact this day of their lives will have on a county ravaged by Covid, one that has endured a disproportionate amount of pain over a brutally annulled year, he surrenders entirely to the depths of his fervour.&quot;Words can&rsquo;t describe it. You know. It is just huge. That&rsquo;s all I can say,&quot; sobbing, he exits the frame.Goalkeeper and captain Raymond Galligan has been the poster boy of a journey from the shadows that has seized the imagination of so many.It was Galligan&rsquo;s 55-yard free at the very death that brought down Monaghan last month and, literally, kick-started a journey into the territories of GAA folklore.His face twisted with emotion, pausing constantly to gather himself, he merits the last word.Quizzed about how this would lift the county, his entire body seems to shudder and jolt and tremble.&quot;Ah, massive. We had our doom and gloom over the last couple of months with Covid. There have been fantastic members of my own parish have passed away. My own community have had a lot of hurt. But, I hope we put a smile on everybody&rsquo;s faces back home today.&quot;We knew there was thousands and thousands of people all over the world, all Cavan people, dressed in their Cavan jerseys, supporting us and screaming for us. We knew in the last quarter, there was every single mother and father and child was at home driving us on. We knew that and that got us over the line today.&quot;Listening to Galligan's sincerity and sense of place, the happy ache in his voice rising and falling like the drumlins of his home county, was to understand that here was a man it would be an honour to follow into battle.If you don&rsquo;t believe me, arm yourself with a Kleenex and call up the clip.Look at his face. Just look at his face.

WASHINGTON (AP) - California Sen. Dianne Feinstein said Monday she will step down from her role as the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, giving up the powerful spot after public criticism of her bipartisan outreach and her handling of Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett‚Äôs confirmation hearings. Feinstein, 87, said in a statement that she would not seek the position in the next Congress. She did not say why, but said she would instead focus on wildfire and drought issues and the effects of climate change, which are important in her home state. She plans to continue to serve on the Judiciary, Appropriations and intelligence panels, but said she will not seek the role of top Democrat on any of those committees. ‚ÄúI will continue to do my utmost to bring about positive change in the coming years,‚Äù she said in the statement. She has held the Judiciary post since 2017. Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin, the Senate‚Äôs No. 2 Democrat, said he will seek to replace Feinstein as the committee‚Äôs top Democrat. He is third in seniority on the panel, after Vermont Sen. Patrick Leahy, who is currently the top Democrat on the appropriations committee. Durbin organized the Democratic response during the Barrett hearings, coordinating an effort to focus the criticism on the court‚Äôs upcoming consideration of the health care law and away from the nominee personally. He led daily news conferences during breaks in the hearings with the other Democrats on the panel while Feinstein usually did not appear. ‚ÄúWe have to roll up our sleeves and get to work on undoing the damage of the last four years and protecting fundamental civil and human rights,‚Äù Durbin said in a statement. Durbin‚Äôs office has said there is nothing in Democratic caucus rules that blocks him form serving in his leadership post and also as the top Democrat on Judiciary.Feinstein, first elected in 1992, has been a powerful force in the Democratic Party and is the former chairwoman of the intelligence panel. She has not shied from bipartisanship even as her state has become increasingly liberal and both parties have become more polarized. That tension came to a head at the Barrett hearings, when Feinstein closed out the proceedings with an embrace for Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and a public thanks to Graham for a job well done. Democrats fiercely opposed Barrett‚Äôs nomination to replace the late liberal icon Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. ‚ÄúThis has been one of the best set of hearings that I‚Äôve participated in,‚Äù Feinstein said at the end of the hearing. Those actions put her immediately in the crosshairs of some influential liberals who had been questioning for some time whether she was right for the job. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs time for Sen. Feinstein to step down from her leadership position on the Senate Judiciary Committee,‚Äù said Brian Fallon, the executive director of Demand Justice, which opposes conservative nominees to the courts. ‚ÄúIf she won‚Äôt, her colleagues need to intervene.‚ÄùFeinstein also irked some of her fellow Democrats at Barrett‚Äôs first confirmation hearing, in 2017 for an appeals court, when she said that Barrett‚Äôs opposition to abortion must be rooted in her religion and questioned if it would influence her rulings on the bench, saying the ‚Äúdogma lives loudly within you.‚ÄùRepublicans seized on the phrase, saying it was offensive to Catholics. The backlash helped Barrett rise in the ranks of Supreme Court hopefuls. Graham also seized on Feinstein‚Äôs complimentary words at the end of Barrett‚Äôs hearings, frequently repeating them on the campaign trail in his reelection bid this year and using the backlash to disparage Democrats. ‚ÄúI hate the fact that saying something nice about me, about the way I conducted the hearings, has gotten to the point now that people will drive you out of office,‚Äù Graham said.In a statement, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said he was ‚Äúgrateful for Senator Feinstein‚Äôs leadership and contributions to our caucus and country‚Äù in the Judiciary post. Feinstein‚Äôs ‚Äúexperience, decades-long relationship with President-elect Biden, and leadership on so many issues will continue to be an asset for our caucus, California, and the country as we begin a new term with the new president,‚Äù said Schumer, D-N.Y. It is still unclear which party will hold the majority in the Senate next year. If Democrats win two runoff elections in Georgia, they could take the Senate very narrowly. Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley is expected to reclaim the top Republican spot on the panel next session after leaving for two years to head the Senate Finance Committee. ___Associated Press writer Meg Kinnard in Columbia, S.C., contributed to this report.

WASHINGTON (AP) - President-elect Joe Biden is set to formally introduce his national security team to the nation, building out a team of Obama administration alumni that signals his shift away from the Trump administration‚Äôs ‚ÄúAmerica First‚Äù policies and a return to U.S. engagement on the global stage.The picks for national security and foreign-policy posts include former Secretary of State John Kerry to take the lead on combating climate change. Kerry and several other people set to join the upcoming administration will be discussed by Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris during a Tuesday afternoon event.Outside the realm of national security and foreign policy, Biden is expected to choose Janet Yellen as the first woman to become treasury secretary. She was nominated by President Barack Obama to lead the Federal Reserve, the first woman in that position, and served from 2014 to 2018.Biden‚Äôs emerging Cabinet marks a return to a more traditional approach to governing, relying on veteran policymakers with deep expertise and strong relationships in Washington and global capitals. And with a roster that includes multiple women and people of color ‚Äî some of whom are breaking historic barriers in their posts ‚Äî Biden is fulfilling his campaign promise to lead a team that reflects the diversity of America.The Biden-Harris team announced key appointments on Monday.The incoming president will nominate longtime adviser Antony Blinken to be secretary of state; lawyer Alejandro Mayorkas to be homeland security secretary; Linda Thomas-Greenfield to be U.S. ambassador to the United Nations; and Jake Sullivan as national security adviser. Avril Haines, a former deputy director of the CIA, will be nominated as director of national intelligence, the first woman to hold that post.Thomas-Greenfield is Black, and Mayorkas is Cuban American.Those being introduced on Tuesday ‚Äúare experienced, crisis-tested leaders who are ready to hit the ground running on day one,‚Äù the transition said in a statement. ‚ÄúThese officials will start working immediately to rebuild our institutions, renew and reimagine American leadership to keep Americans safe at home and abroad, and address the defining challenges of our time ‚Äî from infectious disease, to terrorism, nuclear proliferation, cyber threats, and climate change.‚ÄùIn the weeks ahead, Biden could also name Mich√®le Flournoy as the first woman to lead the Defense Department. Pete Buttigieg, the former Indiana mayor and onetime presidential candidate, has also been mentioned as a contender for a Cabinet agency.In making the choices public on Monday, Biden moved forward with plans to fill out his administration even as President Donald Trump refused to concede defeat in the Nov. 3 election, has pursued baseless legal challenges in several key states and worked to stymie the transition process.Trump said later Monday that he was directing his team to cooperate on the transition but vowed to keep up the fight. His comment came after the General Services Administration ascertained that Biden was the apparent winner of the election, clearing the way for the start of the transition from Trump‚Äôs administration and allowing Biden to coordinate with federal agencies on plans for taking over on Jan. 20.Biden‚Äôs nominations were generally met with silence on Capitol Hill, where the Senate‚Äôs balance of power hinges on two runoff races that will be decided in January.The best known of the bunch is Kerry, who made climate change one of his top priorities while serving as Obama‚Äôs secretary of state, during which he also negotiated the Iran nuclear deal and the Paris climate accord. Trump withdrew from both agreements, which he said represented a failure of American diplomacy in a direct shot at Kerry, whom he called the worst secretary of state in U.S. history.‚ÄúAmerica will soon have a government that treats the climate crisis as the urgent national security threat it is,‚Äù Kerry said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm proud to partner with the president-elect, our allies, and the young leaders of the climate movement to take on this crisis as the president‚Äôs climate envoy.‚ÄùBlinken, 58, served as deputy secretary of state and deputy national security adviser during the Obama administration. He recently participated in a national security briefing with Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris and weighed in publicly just last week on notable foreign policy issues in Egypt and Ethiopia.Blinken served on the National Security Council during the Clinton administration before becoming staff director for the Senate Foreign Relations Committee when Biden was chair of the panel. In the early years of the Obama administration, Blinken returned to the NSC and was Biden‚Äôs national security adviser when Biden was vice president, then moved to the State Department to serve as deputy to Kerry.___Associated Press writers Michael Balsamo in Washington, Bill Barrow in Atlanta and Alexandra Jaffe in Wilmington, Delaware, contributed to this report.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.

Self-care isn‚Äôt a new fad. The difference is that pre-pandemic, it could fall by the wayside if a to-do list got crowded. Now, eight months into the new reality, it is a priority.

In the 1980s, the Canadian Tourism Commission (now Destination Canada) began offering experiences that encouraged tourists to ‚Äúgo native‚Äù through pre- packaged cultural encounters with Indigenous people. These experiences exacerbated stereotypes about Indigenous people. Certain gendered constructs‚ÄîIndigenous women as tragic ‚Äúprimitives‚Äù or romanticized Pocahontas types‚Äîpersisted. In the absence of Indigenous operators, tourists came to expect them.

Jim√©nez L√≥pez apoy√≥ a Enrique C√°rdenas durante las elecciones extraordinarias para gobernador, por lo que indic√≥ que su labor result√≥ importante para que se obtuvieran resultados positivos para el panismo El presidente nacional del PAN, Marko Cort√©s Mendoza, se deshizo en elogios hacia el diputado local Oswaldo Jim√©nez L√≥pez, por lo que podr√≠a estar siendo considerado como ‚Äòplan B‚Äô por la alcald√≠a ante el enfrentamiento entre Genoveva Huerta y Eduardo Rivera, que entr√≥ a su punto m√°s √°lgido con la filtraci√≥n de las conversaciones de la dirigente estatal con el ex alcalde. El legislador local present√≥ su segundo informe de actividades, el cual cont√≥ con la participaci√≥n del l√≠der nacional del blanquiazul, quien reconoci√≥ el trabajo que ha hecho el poblano al interior del partido. Esto debido a que record√≥ que a diferencia de otros perfiles panistas, apoy√≥ a Enrique C√°rdenas S√°nchez durante las elecciones extraordinarias que se llevaron a cabo el a√±o pasado, afirmando que su labor result√≥ importante para que se obtuvieran resultados positivos para el panismo en la capital del estado. ‚ÄúNosotros como PAN ganamos frente a Morena en la elecci√≥n extraordinaria y t√∫, amigo Oswaldo, fuiste parte fundamental, nunca te echaste para atr√°s, estuviste ah√≠ con nostramos, estuviste con Acci√≥n Nacional y nuestro candidato empujando‚Äù, dijo. Cort√©s Mendoza tambi√©n destac√≥ las actividades legislativas que Jim√©nez L√≥pez ha realizado en el congreso local, despu√©s de recordar que existieron diputados que llegaron a su cargo a trav√©s del PAN y despu√©s abandonaron el partido. ‚ÄúReconozco el esfuerzo que al interior del grupo parlamentario has estado haciendo (‚Ä¶) enhorabuena Oswaldo por este informe de labores, por las batallas que hayas dado‚Äù, expres√≥. De esta manera es que Cort√©s Mendoza le dio un espaldarazo a Oswaldo Jim√©nez de cara al proceso electoral del pr√≥ximo a√±o, pues el diputado local ha manifestado sus intenciones de buscar la alcald√≠a de Puebla, pese a ser de los perfiles menos preferidos seg√∫n los resultados de distintas casas encuestadoras. Dentro de su mensaje, Marko Cort√©s aprovech√≥ para hacer un llamado a la unidad al interior del partido blanquiazul, a fin de que se puedan obtener buenos resultados dentro de los comicios electorales. Esto tras las acciones de la dirigente estatal Genoveva Huerta en su b√∫squeda por la candidatura a la alcald√≠a de Puebla, pues en d√≠as pasados se filtr√≥ una conversaci√≥n suya con Eduardo Rivera P√©rez, exhibiendo la negativa del ex edil de reunirse con ella, destacando el hecho de que los chats difundidos se dan desde el punto de vista de la panista. ‚ÄúHoy mi exhorto es a seguir sumando, a seguir trabajando, estoy convencido que si nos sumamos todos Puebla va pintarse de azul, Puebla la capital, Puebla varios municipios y muchos de sus distritos‚Äù, manifest√≥.
