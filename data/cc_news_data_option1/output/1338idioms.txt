The Lewiston-Clarkston Valley dominated the boys’ and girls’ basketball landscape in the small-school divisions of the state as the Idaho Statesman in Boise released its annual All-Idaho teams today.
 The Tribune does not have a say in the process. These are teams strictly voted on by the coaches in each classification throughout the state and conducted by Statesman.
 The area had a total of six of 10 first-team spots in Class 1A Division I, while the region also had the player of the year and coach of the year on the girls’ side. Nine players were honored in the class between the boys’ and girls’ teams.
 There was one honoree on the boys’ side in Class 4A, while there were two honorees, each on the second team, in girls’ Class 1A Division II.
 In girls’ Class 1A Division I, Prairie’s Madison Shears earned the player of the year honor. The 5-foot-4 junior guard did it all for the Pirates. She averaged 16.8 points, 4.0 rebounds, 3.0 steals and 3.0 assists per game in helping Prairie to a 17-4 overall record and a runner-up finish in the state tournament behind Lapwai. In the Feb. 22 final against the Wildcats at the Ford Idaho Center in Nampa, Shears had a team-high 13 points on 4-for-10 shooting from the field, adding a pair of rebounds.
 “Madison is a great floor leader and our leader at the point position,” Prairie coach Lori Mader told the Statesman. “She made key shots that showed the type of leader she is.”
 Lapwai interim coach Ada Marks was named the classification’s coach of the year. She led the team to a 25-1 record and the Wildcats’ state record 10th championship after turmoil before the start of the season led to her elevation.
 Eric Spencer was set to lead the team this season, but just days before the campaign was to begin, Spencer submitted his resignation to the Lapwai School District amid controversy.
 Family was a big theme of the season for the Wildcats. In some form or fashion, all of the Lapwai players are related to one another. That was something Marks noted after the Wildcats won the title.
 “It was just their grit,” Marks told the Tribune after the championship game. “I talked about it all season, and even in this big of a tournament, they never gave up. They never hung their heads and never (let adversity) change how they played the game.”
 The Wildcats’ KC Lussoro and Grace Sobotta also made the first team in Class 1A Division I.
 Lussoro, a senior, averaged 13 points per game and was a stalwart on defense, where Marks typically asked the wing to guard the opposition’s best player.
 Sobotta, a 5-8 sophomore guard, is a two-time selection. She averaged 10.0 points, 4.0 rebounds, 2.0 assists and 2.0 steals per game. Sobotta had 14 points and eight rebounds in the title game against Prairie.
 Sobotta’s sister, Glory, was a second-team honoree. The 5-7 junior guard averaged 9.4 points, 1.4 assists and 1.3 steals per game for the Wildcats. She led Lapwai with 17 points and added five rebounds in the championship.
 Also making the Class 1A Division I girls’ second team was Genesee junior guard Bailey Leseman. She averaged 12.5 points, 2.7 rebounds and 2.6 steals in helped the Bulldogs finish 18-11 overall and a spot in the third-place game.
 The Salmon River duo of Lotus Harper and Emily Diaz earned spots on the girls’ Class 1A Division II second team. Harper, a 5-6 junior point guard, averaged 12.8 points, 5.8 rebounds and 3.0 assists while Diaz, a 5-8 senior center, averaged 13.3 points, 7.1 rebounds and 2.3 assists per game for the Savages (17-6). Diaz had 14 points, six rebounds and three assists, while Harper tallied 12 points, seven rebounds, three assists and three steals in Salmon River’s third-place game against Tri-Valley.
 Although neither team won the title, Potlatch and Lawpai dominated the spots on the boys’ Class 1A Division I teams, taking four of the 10 spots overall.
 The Loggers had two spots on the first team, led by senior Brayden Hadaller. A two-time, first-team All-Idaho standout, Hadaller, at 6-3, avereaged 16.4 points, 6.8 rebounds and 5.2 assists per game to lead Potlatch (22-3) to third place in the state.
 Senior Connor Akins also landed on the first team. The 6-2 senior forward averaged 14.4 points for the Loggers and shot 50 percent from the field on the season. As a third-year starter, he typically was tasked by coach Ryan Ball to guard the opponents’ top scoring threat.
 Potlatch had two epic battles with The Ambrose School, the eventual state champion. The Loggers beat the Archers 57-44 in a neutral-site game Feb. 8 in which Akins finished with a game-high 21 points. However, Ambrose got revenge in the state tournament, beating Potlatch 39-37 in overtime of a March 6 state semifinal game. Hadaller finished with 13 points and Akins added 11 in that one.
 Lapwai’s Titus Yearout also earned a spot on the first team. The 6-2 sophomore guard led the entire state in scoring at 29.5 points per game. The Whitepine League Division I player of the year had the ability to single-handedly take charge of games with his ability to score from anywhere on the court.
 Wildcats sophomore AJ Ellenwood was named to the second team. The 6-4 center averaged eight points, 11 rebounds and two blocks per game to help Lapwai to a 22-4 mark.
 In the third-place game March 7, Hadaller had 14 points, six rebounds and four assists, while Akins chipped in 12 points as the Loggers beat the Wildcats 62-49. Yearout finished with 16 points and six assists, and Ellenwood tallied six points.
 In Class 4A, Moscow’s Benny Kitchel earned a second-team nod. The 6-4 junior wing averaged 12.6 points, 3.4 rebounds and 2.9 assists to lead the Bears (17-10) to the state title game.
 In a 59-43 loss to Preston in that state final March 7, Kitchel finished with a team-high 12 points.

Some of our grandkids are so young they will not remember this time of social distancing and isolation amid a global pandemic. Others are old enough that they will remember schools closing, playgrounds off-limits, no visits with their friends, cousins or grandparents.
 My father-in-law, Hub, had a phenomenal memory. He often told of the time his family home was quarantined. What struck me every time he told the story was the detail about the teddy bear and how that was permanently seared into his memory.
 He was 5 at the time. His older sister, Alice, was 8 and his oldest sister, Mabel, was 12. Alice got sick and the doctor diagnosed it as scarlet fever. Outbreaks of scarlet fever in the early 1900s were often deadly or left children with lifelong disabilities. It was also highly contagious.
 The doctor said Hub and Mabel had to stay away until Alice got better and the house had been fumigated.
 Later in life Hub put his memories to paper, filling one yellow legal pad after another. He wrote, “There was no place to go except to Grandpa and Grandma’s, just down the road. We were packed up and sent off to their house. I had a little coaster wagon that we put our clothes in, and a few of my toys, and we walked down the road.
 “On the way, my little teddy bear fell off, and when we discovered the loss, we went back to look for it. A man who was working with a crew paving the road found it and gave it back to me.”
 He recalled days spent waiting out in the front yard, watching the men work on the highway and waiting for his sister Mabel to return from school.
 His dad often brought them food, cereal, fruit and milk for the grandparents to feed them.
 “My grandparents were old and poor and didn’t have very many pieces of good furniture. The mattresses were muslin bags filled with corn shucks. They weren’t too happy about having us there. They talked in German between themselves, most of the time, and we surmised they were conversing about us. Whether this actually happened or not, we do not know for sure, but we thought so.”
 They stayed with their grandparents three or four weeks. “It was a happy day when Dad came down and told us we could go home.”
 What will be our memories of this time in history?
 I hope we remember family, friends and neighbors checking on one another, caring for one another. I hope we remember the exhausted medical personnel and first responders risking their own health, the truck drivers, food service workers, and all the clerks and cashiers who kept grocery stores open. Never forget the garbage collectors, and that the mail kept coming.
 I hope we remember private industry retrofitting plants for the manufacture of face masks and ventilators, scientists, researchers and pharmaceutical companies racing to find therapeutic treatments and a vaccine.
 I hope we remember how fear cast a long shadow. May we also remember renewed soul searching, fervent prayers and leaning hard on God.
 We are writing history. May we write it well.

While the nationwide lockdown has caused a disruption in the day to day life of almost every individual in the country, the situations of sex workers residing in Nashik's Bhadrakali are no different. These sex workrs are facing a financial crisis due to lockdown and are demanding help from the government to make their ends meet.
 "If all citizens of the country are getting help from the government why we should be left behind. The government should help us too as we have children whom we need to support. We neither have savings through which we can sustain ourselves nor have we done any business in the past few days," a sex worker from the Bhadrakali area told ANI here. "We have Aadhar, ration cards still we do not get any help as we are treated like below par citizens because of our profession. Every class of citizens in the country have got help from the government, then why should we be left wanting," another sex worker added.
 The condition of sex workers in Nashik is not a unique one as women who pursue this profession around the country are facing problems a huge financial crisis with many of them not being able to feed their families. Sex workers in Sonagachi, a red-light area in North Kolkata, West Bengal, and in the GB road area in the national capital Delhi also narrated similar difficulties. (ANI)

Elsewhere, Texas GOP Gov. Greg Abbott also described religious services as essential in his order to limit gatherings during the pandemic. In Georgia, where some of the state’s worst virus outbreaks have been linked to large religious services, GOP Gov. Brian Kemp on Thursday issued a stay-home order that states no faith-based gathering can occur with more than 10 people unless they keep a six-foot distance.
 While some faith leaders who continue to hold in-person services have pointed to their First Amendment rights, including Ohio’s Solid Rock megachurch, it’s not clear that their activity during the pandemic would be legally protected.
 State or local governments would be “constitutionally justified” in including houses of worship in their closure orders during a public health emergency as long as those orders are “generally applicable,” said John Inazu, a law professor at Washington University in St. Louis who studies the First Amendment.
 But the burden shifts if a government attempts to stop a church from holding services with less than 10 people while allowing secular businesses to operate under the same conditions, Inazu added: “There, I think there’s a very plausible religious freedom claim.”
 Before issuing his order, Kemp held two calls with hundreds of clergy from across Georgia, urging houses of worship to stream services online or implement other social distancing measures, like holding drive-up services where people listen from their cars.
 Most religious services across the country have already moved online.
 “We’re making the best of a bad situation. It’s going to be devastating in the short term,” said Todd Gaddis, senior pastor of the First Baptist Church in Dallas, Georgia, referring to the loss of donations from in-person services. “But I’m confident there will be spiritual dividends in the long run.”
 And the Trump administration’s entreaties for churches to stop meeting in- person extended beyond the White House. Sam Brownback, the president’s special envoy for religious freedom, said Thursday that “religious groups should practice social distancing.”

President Donald Trump met by phone with many U.S. pro sports leaders Saturday to discuss how that industry has been affected by the global coronavirus pandemic, saying he was looking forward to the resumption of competitions “as soon as we can.”
 “I want fans back in the arenas,” Trump said later in a briefing at the White House. “I think it’s ... whenever we’re ready. As soon as we can, obviously. And the fans want to be back too. They want to see basketball and baseball and football and hockey. They want to see their sports. They want to go out onto the golf courses and breathe nice, clean, beautiful fresh air.”
 A person with direct knowledge of what was discussed on the call said Trump thinks the NFL season — scheduled to begin Sept. 10 — will start on time with fans in seats. But that seemed too optimistic for California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who was asked if he thought the NFL season would start on time.
 “I’m not anticipating that happening in this state,” said Newsom, whose state has three NFL franchises.
 The NBA, NHL, NFL and Major League Baseball all were represented on the call by their commissioners — Adam Silver, Gary Bettman, Roger Goodell and Rob Manfred, respectively. None of the leagues released public comment about the call.
 A second person with knowledge of the call said some commissioners, Silver among them, stressed to Trump they are working on multiple plans to resume their seasons but cautioned none of those plans can be enacted without clearance from public health officials. The people spoke on condition of anonymity because no discussion from the call was to be revealed publicly.
 Others on the call included PGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan, Indianapolis Motor Speedway owner Roger Penske, UFC president Dana White, World Wrestling Entertainment owner Vince McMahon, MLS commissioner Don Garber, WNBA commissioner Cathy Englebert, LPGA commissioner Mike Whan and Breeders’ Cup president Drew Fleming.
 The NBA was the first of the major U.S. sports leagues to shut down on March 11, doing so after Utah Jazz center Rudy Gobert tested positive for the COVID-19 virus. Other leagues quickly followed, and hundreds of games already have been lost. The NCAA men’s and women’s basketball tournaments were canceled along with virtually every other college athletic event for the remainder of the academic year; major events like the Masters, the Kentucky Derby, Wimbledon, the French Open and the Indianapolis 500 have been either canceled or postponed; and thousands of arena employees have lost work because of the shutdown of the sports and entertainment industries.
 NASCAR gave teams a tentative schedule to resume racing May 24 with the Coca- Cola 600 at Charlotte Motor Speedway. North Carolina’s stay-at-home order is through April 30. The next race on NASCAR’s schedule is May 9 at Martinsville Speedway in Virginia, which is under a stay-at-home order through June 10. NASCAR so far has declined to publicly address the schedule and said it had no comment on the call with Trump.
 Penske suspended the IndyCar season 48 hours before the opening race and the next publicly scheduled event is May 30 at Detroit, a doubleheader Penske has said can be moved to later in the season if necessary.
 Penske already has rescheduled the Indianapolis 500 for the first time in history to Aug. 23 from Memorial Day weekend.
 The PGA Tour’s next start still is scheduled for May 21-24, at Colonial in Fort Worth, Texas. After that would be stops in Ohio, Michigan, Canada and then the U.S. Open — scheduled to be played at Winged Foot — extremely close to the virus hotspot of New Rochelle, N.Y. The LPGA Tour just rescheduled its next five events, with the U.S. Women’s Open in Houston now set to be played in December in what would be the latest spot on the calendar ever for a men’s or women’s major championship.
 It remains unclear when anything will be able to resume. Even the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, which announced its 2020 induction class including Kobe Bryant on Saturday, has a backup plan for October in case the pandemic delays its planned Aug. 29 enshrinement ceremony.
 “I want to be happy and I am happy,” said Baylor women’s basketball coach Kim Mulkey, one of this year’s Hall inductees. “But at the same time, I want to also keep perspective right now, and let’s all do our part and let’s all get this world back on track and our country back on track.”
 Trump addressed Little League players, tweeting to tell them, “hang in there! We will get you back out on the fields, and know that you will be playing baseball soon. We will get through this together, and bats will be swinging before you know it.”
 Trump even said the need for physical distancing is affecting his 14-year-old son, Barron. The president described his son as a good athlete and soccer fan.
 “We have to get back,” Trump said. “We have to get back. Remember that. We have to get back and we have to get back soon.”

US President Donald Trump told Americans to brace for a big spike in coronavirus fatalities in the coming days, as the country faces what he called the toughest two weeks of the pandemic.&quot;There's going to be a lot of death,&quot; Trump said at a briefing with reporters.He pushed back on criticism that the federal government has not done enough to get ventilators that many critically ill coronavirus patients need to survive to the states, saying some governors are asking for more machines than they will need.&quot;Fears of shortages have led to inflated requests,&quot; Trump said of submissions his administration has received to dole out equipment from the strategic national stockpile.The United States has the world's highest number of known cases of COVID-19, the flu-like respiratory disease caused by the coronavirus. More than 306,000 people have tested positive in the United States and over 8,300 have died, according to a Reuters tally.White House medical experts have forecast that between 100,000 to 240,000 Americans could be killed in the pandemic, even if sweeping orders to stay home are followed.&quot;We are coming up to a time that is going to be very horrendous,&quot; Trump said at the White House. &quot;We probably have never seen anything like these kind of numbers. Maybe during the war, during a World War One or Two or something.&quot;'Like a fire'In the grimmest day yet for the US state hit hardest by the pandemic, coronavirus-related illnesses killed 630 people in the last 24 hours in New York state,gGovernor Andrew Cuomo said on Saturday.The disease has now killed 3,565 people in New York and the situation is particularly worrying on Long Island, east of New York City, where the number of cases &quot;is like a fire spreading,&quot; Cuomo told a news conference.Health experts calculate that New York, home both to bustling Manhattan and hilly farm country stretching to the Canadian border, might be around a week away from the worst point in the health crisis which has killed about 60,000 people worldwide.&quot;We're not yet at the apex, we're getting closer ... Our reading of the projections is we're somewhere in the seven-day range,&quot; Cuomo said.&quot;It's only been 30 days since our first case,&quot; he said. &quot;It feels like an entire lifetime.&quot;New York City alone accounted for more than a quarter of the US coronavirus deaths tallied by Johns Hopkins University. Hospitals and morgues in the city are struggling to treat the desperately ill and bury the dead.Because of the risk of infection, many people with critically ill relatives in New York City are unable to see their loved ones in their final hours.A resident at New York- Presbyterian hospital said he and his colleagues have made several death notification phone calls every shift this week.&quot;There's something sort of unquantifiably painful about telling a family their loved one died without letting them see them,&quot; he said.The emergency stockpile of medical equipment maintained by the US government has nearly run out of protective garb for doctors and nurses.Cuomo announced that the Chinese government facilitated a donation of 1,000 ventilators that will arrive at JFK airport on Saturday.&quot;This is a big deal and it's going to make a significant difference for us,&quot; Cuomo said.The dispatch of the ventilators was a result of a conversation on March 27 between President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, a source familiar with the discussions said.Staying home, finallyAlmost all Americans are under orders from state and local officials to stay home except for essential outings such as grocery shopping or seeing a doctor.Areas of the country such as Florida and Texas that had been slow to lock down have started practicing social distancing and sheltering at home.&quot;We see what's going on in New York now, we see that people are dying,&quot; Rick Scott, a US senator from Florida, told Fox News Channel.&quot;People are beginning to understand that the best way that we can slow the spread and actually avoid death is by this stay-at-home standard, going out only for essential services,&quot; Texas governor Greg Abbott told the channel. He was among the last governors to issue a statewide order telling residents to avoid leaving their home.There were still some hold-outs elsewhere, though.Louisiana pastor Tony Spell said he plans to hold three services at his 1,000-member Life Tabernacle megachurch in a suburb of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, on Palm Sunday this weekend, defying state orders against assembling in large groups.&quot;We're defying the rules because the commandment of God is to spread the Gospel,&quot; he told Reuters.Louisiana has become a US hot spot for the virus, on Saturday reporting a jump in deaths to 409.

When Sen. Mary Souza of Coeur d’Alene talks about the state of the economy — with businesses closed and staff reductions — she isn’t thinking only of situations happening to “somebody else.”
 Souza and her husband, Rick, are going through the same struggles of many business people throughout the Gem State as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. The Souzas make their living staging corporate events, which include elaborate graphics and all the production bells and whistles that make those happenings shine — and corporate customers asking for more.
 It’s a booming enterprise when times are good, but to say it’s “slow” now is an understatement. Their calendar is empty, with businesses large and small canceling corporate events, and their 12 employees are on reduced schedules.
 “It’s what bars, restaurants and other businesses are going through, absolutely,” she says. “I understand cash flow needs, and employee needs.”
 As a third-term Republican senator, she also knows a thing or two about state government and understands what her fellow lawmakers may be facing next year — especially if the virtual lockdown from the coronavirus goes into the fall or beyond. If that happens, the Legislature won’t be worried so much about some of the issues that were at the forefront of this session — such as transgender athletes, reversing affirmative action or what’s printed on Idaho license plates. Next year’s session has the potential of making the recession of a decade ago look like the height of prosperity by comparison.
 Souza doesn’t claim to have a crystal ball, but she doesn’t see gloom and doom on the horizon — for the state, or her family business.
 “We’ve been through ups and downs for over 35 years. Our calendar emptied out completely on the afternoon of the 9/11 attack, so we’ve been through this before. We know how to survive,” she said.
 On the legislative front, she thinks the next session will be business as usual — with the education budget getting a boost and state government providing usual services.
 “We will be back on the road to working — not all the way back, because it will take the economy time to recover,” she says. “But I don’t think this will be long lasting.”
 For one thing, she says, President Donald Trump won’t tolerate a long-term shutdown on the federal level. He has talked about getting at least some people back to work by Easter.
 “He is a business-oriented person. He has seen the need for a shutdown to this degree right now, but I do not believe he will let this go on. The economy couldn’t stand it,” Souza says. “They are working fast and furious to do testing and find treatments for the virus. I see a turnaround, not necessarily quickly, but I think in the next several weeks, we’ll be talking about getting back to work and getting the economy going.”
 So far, she has gotten negative reviews from constituents on Gov. Brad Little’s stay-at-home order.
 “I’m not opining on the governor’s decision, because I don’t have all the information he has. But I do know that people are concerned and discouraged by the fact that the orders have become more stringent rather than less,” she says. “I have yet to get one email or phone call that supports what the governor did.”
 Overall, her outlook remains positive. “I think people will be getting back to work sooner rather than later.”
 Senate President Pro-Tem Brent Hill of Rexburg, who is retiring after 19 years in the Legislature, isn’t offering predictions, but says lawmakers are equipped to deal with whatever happens.
 “Recessions pose unique problems, but in some ways they are not unique at all,” says Hill. “They’re dealing with the same issues the Legislature did a hundred years ago — how to fund public education, how to improve higher education and taxes.”
 For now, he says, it’s important that Idahoans take the steps needed to stay safe. “We don’t need to panic — we’ll get through this,” he said.
 And the Legislature will find a way to get through this, hopefully close to the way that Souza expects. As for Hill, his calm nature — which comes in handy during times of political chaos — will be sorely missed when the Legislature convenes in January.

Saif further said that acting happened because he took a chance and he knew he could have never done a 9-5 job. After the Gwalior ad that he had done with his parents, he got his first offer from Anand Mahindroo. Saif said his mother encouraged him after he got his first offer. However, that didn't work out due to various issues. The project itself was cancelled as the actor was left hanging. Even after six months, there was no progress on the script.

COEUR D’ ALENE — A 47-year-old Texas man was arrested in Idaho on charges of interference with a child custody order after he was accused of taking his 6-year-son on an 1,800-mile trip during a scheduled visitation, authorities said.
 Ronald Whitted of Fort Worth, Texas, had a visitation session with his son last week, but he was accused of not returning the boy to his mother and instead going on a multi-day trip, the Coeur d’Alene Press reported.
 Texas authorities believed the child was in danger and enlisted the help of the U.S. Marshals task force to locate Whitted, who they learned had traveled to northern Idaho.
 Whitted left Hurst, Texas, around March 17 and began the trip north, police said, adding the drive is estimated at 27 hours, or about three days.
 “He was believed to have attempted to flee the country,” U.S. Marshals deputy Michael Leigh said. “After being on the run for almost two weeks, the Greater Idaho Fugitive Task Force … tracked Whitted and his son to an apartment in downtown Coeur d’Alene.”
 The child was safely recovered, authorities said.
 U.S. Marshals-led task forces find and arrest fugitives throughout the country who are charged with violent crimes, drug offenses, sex offenders and other serious felonies, and they investigate and recover missing and exploited children, Leigh said.
 Whitted’s attorney in Idaho, Anne Taylor, did not immediately return a phone message left by the Associated Press.
 Whitted is being held without bond in the Kootenai County Jail until he can be extradited to Texas.
 Extradition proceedings will begin this month for Whitted, who faces civil charges in Kootenai County, and whose criminal charges will be pursued in Texas. His next court appearance is next Friday in Coeur d’Alene.

 "Maya Angelou would have turned 92 today, and I couldn’t agree more with her wisdom on the matter. ‘There is no greater agony than bearing an untold story inside you.’ I’ll check back soon Until then, stay Safe, Optimistic, Vigilant, And maybe most importantly-Connected, RDJ,” he added.
   
 On the other hand, word on the street is that the birthday boy is in search of a way he could get back into the Marvel Cinematic Universe through a special cameo in the upcoming _Spider-Man 3_.
 Sources have revealed that this will be possible by bringing his character back as AI that mentors and guides Tom Holland’s character of Peter Parker aka Spider-Man.
