There's little doubt that Mike Tyson is one of the most controversial fighters - if not athletes - in history. Whether it was doing time for rape, biting a piece of an opponent's ear off, talking insanely or acting in a violent manner outside the ring, Tyson earned himself quite a dangerous reputation during his prime years of fame. Mellower and more honest than he once was, the former heavyweight great has now decided to come clean about the fact he cheated while being tested for drug use.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Republicans controlling the Senate unveiled a government-wide, $1.4 trillion spending bill on Tuesday, a largely bipartisan measure that faces uncertain odds during this period of post- election tumult in Washington.The GOP-drafted measure contains funding for President Donald Trump’s border wall and other provisions opposed by Democrats, but top leaders in both parties want to try to mount a drive to enact the unfinished spending bills — which, along with a separate COVID-19 relief effort and annual defense policy bill, represent the bulk of Capitol Hill’s unfinished business for the year.Success depends on getting the signature of Trump, however, whose unpredictability and toxic relationships with Democrats threaten to doom the effort. The recent history of lame-duck sessions conducted as the White House is turning over has been that unfinished spending bills get kicked into the next year, with existing funding simply left on auto-pilot.“I’ve had this argument before and so far I’ve lost. I argued 12 years ago, the Obama transition, that the best thing you could do to help the new president was to get this year’s work done, and we didn’t get it done,” said Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo. “Four years ago I argued that ... and we didn’t get it done.”At issue is the roughly one-third of the federal budget that is written annually by Congress under a time-tested bipartisan process. The overall spending amount has been set in law by last year’s bipartisan budget mini-deal, so any delay into next year won’t likely result in more money for the Biden administration. Current funding expires Dec. 12.The 12 spending measures, released by Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Richard Shelby, R-Ala., have been stalled for months, trapped by fights over COVID relief and potential battles over police reform issues. But he has the backing of top panel Democrat Patrick Leahy of Vermont, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer of New York to at least pursue the effort. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., herself a long- ago veteran of the Appropriations Committee, also would like to wrap up the unfinished business.“By and large, these bills are the product of bipartisan cooperation among members of the committee,” Shelby said in a statement. “Time after time, we have demonstrated our willingness to work together and get the job done. We have before us the opportunity to deliver for the American people once again.”But Leahy carefully avoided endorsing the measure outright and instead criticized the legislation for ignoring COVID-19 relief, shortchanging safety net programs and the environment, and wasting money on unused detention beds for immigrants entering the country illegally.Large swaths of the measure are indeed bipartisan, including a $696 billion defense budget that adds 96 F-35 fighters to the Pentagon’s ranks, funds nine Navy ships, and provides $69 billion for overseas military operations. It adopts $2 billion for 82 miles of border wall, certain to be fought by Democrats, along with $8.8 billion for Immigration and Customs Enforcement that Democrats charge isn’t needed because there are fewer apprehensions of illegal border-crossers.NASA, health research, and veterans' programs all would be rewarded with healthy increases, while foreign aid and education programs would get smaller increases.If the catch-all bill is to advance it would have to contain COVID relief such as funding to help schools reopen, vaccinate the country, help the jobless, and boost the economy.“This country is headed for a deadly winter and it is long past time for us to provide the resources the country needs to get this virus under control and our economy back open,” Leahy said in a statement. “These bills do not provide any such relief. It is imperative that we do what is necessary to stop this pandemic from spreading.”Copyright 2020 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The state Department of Health reported Tuesday that the three-county area saw 249 new positive cases of COVID-19 and eight new deaths attributed to the disease.
 Luzerne County added 133 new cases and one new death, Schuylkill County added 83 new cases and seven new deaths, and Carbon county added 33 new cases.
 Of Luzerne County’s new cases, five each were reported in Hazleton’s 18201 zip code and Mountain Top; three in Drums; and two in Freeland. In Schuylkill County, eight new cases were reported in Shenandoah; six in Tamaqua; four in Mahanoy City; and two in Coaldale, while in Carbon County, four new cases were reported in Nesquehoning and two in Lansford.
 Fifty-six individuals will have to self-isolate following the latest report of a positive COVID-19 test at Tamaqua Area High School.
 District Superintendent Raymond Kinder Jr. alerted district families to the case Monday evening and said the person is recovering in isolation.
 He noted that the district contacted the state Department of Health.
 He stressed that even though a high number will have to quarantine, they have not tested positive for the virus.
 Those in self-isolation should not attend group functions, interact in-person with others, nor visit public spaces such as restaurants or shopping centers.
 The district announced last week that one high school student and two elementary students had tested positive for COVID-19.
 A Schuylkill County Courthouse employee also tested positive for COVID-19, according to a Tuesday press release. Contact tracing resulted in two other employees needing to quarantine.
 Statewide, the 4,361 new cases reported broke the daily record for the second time in a week and the state’s 62 new deaths marked the most in a day since 69 on June 5, though lagging reporting sometimes inflates Tuesday reports. To date, 9,086 state residents have died of the virus with 238,567 cases overall.

Universities UK said students and staff will "appreciate confirmation of the government's end-of-term plans" in light of the "prolonged uncertainty they have faced this year".
 "With universities being asked to end in-person learning by December 9, some students will now miss out on timetabled placements, practical classes and other in-person teaching near the end of term," a spokeswoman said.
 "Universities will need to work with students and government to manage the challenges this creates.
 "The government must now urgently turn its attention to working with the sector on plans to ensure students can safely resume their studies in person in January, supported by enhanced testing capability."
 Jo Grady, general secretary of the University and College Union, said the government's plans were "riddled with holes" and "raised as many questions as they answer".
 "Allowing just a week for around one million students to travel across the country leaves little room for error," she said.
 "If the government instead told universities to move online now it would provide much more time to stagger the movement of students and better protect the health of staff, students and their wider communities."

In some ways, the coronavirus is still a mystery. Scientists can’t say for certain why it’s deadly or debilitating in some people but has virtually no effect in others. They don’t know exactly how long immunity lasts or whether (or when) a vaccine will stop its spread and bring this wretched chapter to a close.
 But they do know this: The virus spreads most rampantly between people who gather indoors, in close quarters, to talk or laugh or sing, without wearing masks. Experts say the wave of outbreaks now sweeping the nation has been caused by precisely these types of gatherings.
 As gut-wrenching as this may be, one of the most obvious ways to mitigate further viral spread will be for as many people as possible to stay home this holiday season. Even before the recent spike in cases, scientists knew that holidays were risky business. Memorial Day, the Fourth of July and Labor Day weekend were all followed by measurable spikes in case counts. The fall and winter holidays are likely to be much worse, because they tend to involve more travel and indoor gatherings.
 In normal times, some 50 million Americans usually travel at least 50 miles for Thanksgiving dinner, according to AAA. This year, especially, the need to draw loved ones close feels urgent, and the idea of sacrificing one more sacred tradition in a year when we have already sacrificed so much feels deeply unfair. But skipping or severely curtailing in-person holiday celebrations now is as much a civic duty and an act of solidarity as wearing a mask in public or standing at least six feet apart.
 The coronavirus is surging again, not just in a few hot spots but across the country, with an average of 59,000 new cases per day — as high as that number has been since August. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have labeled indoor gatherings with far-flung relatives as “higher risk” and is advising people to keep these get-togethers as small as possible and to hold them outdoors if they can. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the government’s leading infectious disease control expert, has said that, for safety’s sake, he won’t be seeing his own children this Thanksgiving.
 It’s tempting to view the coming holiday season as a well-earned respite from a year filled with hardships. But, as others have argued, those hardships are precisely the point. Children have all but lost a year of schooling, small business owners have seen their livelihoods destroyed, people everywhere have watched loved ones die alone, in nursing homes and hospital wards where restrictions related to COVID-19 prohibited visitors. Failed leadership and failed policy have exacerbated all of these tragedies. Individual or family sacrifices, made for the greater good, have helped.
 Taking unnecessary risks now would be an affront to all those sacrifices. What will have been the point of closing schools, hobbling industries or swapping so many human interactions for so many virtual ones? So much of it will have been for naught if a surge of holiday travel gives way to a tsunami of outbreaks and, ultimately, more death.
 It’s true that not all gatherings are the same and that individual families can minimize their risks by taking precautions — by keeping gatherings small, by holding them outdoors and by testing and quarantining before and after travel. But those things are all much easier to do for families of means, who are more likely to have spacious, easily ventilated kitchens, space to gather outside, easy access to diagnostic testing and the ability to quarantine.
 What’s more, low risk is not the same as no risk, and when it comes to the coronavirus, all risk is ultimately shared. The danger is not individual — it’s collective. The decisions you make are not only about whether you might infect your own grandmother, they’re about whether your family gathering will seed an outbreak that could ultimately infect someone else’s grandmother. The more people gather from far and wide, around densely packed tables, to eat and talk and occasionally shout, the more the coronavirus will spread. That’s an indisputable truth that no amount of wishful thinking or careful planning can undo.
 Zoom gatherings will never fully match the intimacy of in-person ones. But they can help keep families connected and maybe even preserve some traditions. Social media is full of suggestions for how to make virtual holidays more festive, like pie-baking over FaceTime and cooking and eating the same meal across different tables and time zones.
 It might also help to remember that, with vaccines and therapeutics progressing through the pipeline, there’s every reason to hope that next year’s holiday season can be celebrated in person again.
 If the past nine months have made anything clear, it’s that nobody is coming to save us. That’s scary and enraging, but it’s also liberating — because we’re learning how to save ourselves.

A tight majority could cause headaches for Pelosi, empowering any determined group of lawmakers to pressure her on what bills should be considered or look like. But sometimes, a slender margin can help unify a party because its members know they must stick together to achieve anything.
 Democratic moderates and progressives clash periodically, and while the moderates are more numerous, the progressives' ranks include influential social media stars like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.
 Underscoring that tension, House Democrats vented during a three-hour conference call last week in which both factions blamed the other for rhetoric and policies they said proved costly in the campaign.
 "We should be honest that this was not a good outcome," Rep. Tom Malinowski, D-N.J., a moderate freshman, said in an interview. He said terms like "defunding the police" hurt Democrats by making it sound like they oppose law enforcement, and said they shouldn't speak "as if we were talking to woke progressives in neighborhoods where 90% of the votes are for Democrats."
 Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., a progressive leader, said in an interview that Democrats need to discuss "how we talk about some of these issues that are critical to different parts of our base." But with moderates complaining that the GOP hurt Democrats by repeatedly accusing them of pushing socialism, Jayapal said such accusations "will be used against us no matter what we say."
 Democrats believed they'd pick up seats, especially in suburbs, because of a decisive fundraising edge, President Donald Trump's unpopularity and exasperation over the pandemic. Many Republicans and independent polls supported that expectation.
 But with some races still uncalled, Democrats haven't defeated a single GOP incumbent and failed to capture open GOP-held seats in Texas, Missouri and Indiana they thought they'd win.
 Instead, they've lost at least seven incumbents: six freshmen from states including Florida, Oklahoma and South Carolina plus 30-year veteran Rep. Collin Peterson from rural Minnesota. And while they successfully defended most of their 29 districts that Trump carried in his 2016 victory, they saw stronger than expected performances by GOP candidates all around the country.
 "With President Trump on the ballot, it just drove enormous turnout that was almost impossible to surmount," said Rep. Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich., a reelected freshman.
 " The country has become more polarized and divided," said Rep. Gerald Connolly, D-Va. "If you're running in alien territory, you're always at risk of failure."
 So far, Democrats' only pickups were three open seats from which Republicans retired. Two were in North Carolina, where court-ordered remapping made the districts strongly Democratic, and one was outside Atlanta.
 Going into the election, Democrats envisioned strengthening their moderate wing, since most districts they seemed likely to capture were closely divided between GOP and Democratic voters. But they ended up suffering losses in those same type of districts, meaning it was mostly moderates who lost.
 "In electoral politics, moderates are the beachfront property," said Jim Kessler, an official with Third Way, a centrist Democratic group. "And if there's flooding, they're the ones that get washed away."
 Illustrating that, the Blue Dog Coalition of the most conservative House Democrats, whose membership has dwindled in recent years, lost at least six of its roughly two dozen members.
 On the other hand, a handful of hard-left progressive freshmen will be coming to Congress, including Democrats Jamaal Bowman and Mondaire Jones of New York and Cori Bush of Missouri, who each won seats in overwhelmingly blue districts.
 On the Republican side, the conservative House Freedom Caucus was hoping to grow from its roughly 30 members.
 The group has tried pushing GOP leaders to the right over the years and was a consistent source of trouble for the past two Republican speakers, John Boehner of Ohio and Paul Ryan of Wisconsin.

Of the funds from the CCCH Community Fund, $1,377 came from a contribution made by Visit Clearfield County from the proceeds of the Chainsaw Carvers Event they sponsored in June. The $1,377 donation was made possible through the generosity of the four carvers that participated in the event, Doug Ryan, Ray “Knotty Ray” Good, Todd Gladfelter and Mark Mann.
 On behalf of the Charitable Foundation Board and Grant Review Committee, Charitable Foundation Executive Director Mark McCracken said, “The awarded grants went to some fine community based organizations and include projects that will benefit many people with specific needs. Several of the projects will benefit area youths while others address needs for people with medical issues. There are also specific projects to establish a much needed food bank in the Coalport / Irvona area along with a project to purchase and install smoke and carbon monoxide detectors in homes that don’t have them.”
 McCracken added, “We also had some great organizations with viable projects that did not make the cut for funding this year, but we would encourage them to resubmit next year.”
 Since 2006, the Clearfield County Charitable Foundation’s grant program has awarded over $120,000 to projects in communities across Clearfield County.
 Anyone who would like to contribute to help fund grants next year can do so by sending contributions to the Clearfield County Charitable Foundation, PO Box 1442, Clearfield PA 16830 by designating the donation to go to the Community Fund, the Kurtz CLC Donor Designated Fund or the Sara Jane Mattern Fund.

 # One man in hospital, suspect arrested after Port Orchard shooting
 Andrew Binion
 Kitsap Sun
 A 23-year-old Lakewood man shot at a Port Orchard apartment early Tuesday morning was taken to a Tacoma hospital for surgery, and another 23-year-old from Lakewood was arrested.
 At about 2:25 a.m. police in the city were called to the 2200 block of Sidney Avenue after a woman called 911 to say a man had been shot and the suspect had left the scene, according to a statement from a team of Kitsap County-area police investigating the shooting. The statement said the man was shot in the upper torso.
 The suspect, a felon, was booked into the Kitsap County Jail for investigation of first-degree assault and first-degree unlawful possession of a firearm.
 Neither the suspect nor the victim was identified in the statement. No charges have been filed.
 Four adults and a 6-year-old child were in the apartment when the shooting occurred, but the child was not injured, according to the statement.
 The shooting is being investigated by the Kitsap Critical Incident Response Team, made up of officers from Bremerton police, the Kitsap County Sheriff’s Office and Port Orchard police.
 The team is usually formed to investigate officer-involved shootings or the deaths of people when in custody of the police but also assists smaller departments to investigate major crimes.

Jasper James Marshall, of College Park in Adelaide’s inner east, will spend two years behind bars for importing up to $110,000 worth of the drug in 2018.Sentencing him in the District Court on Wednesday, Judge Paul Slattery said Marshall, 23, and two others leased five post office boxes in Adelaide in early 2018.Then, in May of that year, three parcels purportedly containing photographs were sent to Adelaide from Los Angeles.However, they were intercepted by the Australian Border Force and found to contain cocaine in heat-sealed bags.Judge Slattery said a total 275 grams of pure cocaine was found, with a street value of up to $110,000.In June, Border Force officers searched Marshall’s home and found cocaine hidden in shoes in his cupboard as well as more than $5000 in cash, digital scales, plastic bags and three mobile phones.He was charged and pleaded guilty to importing a marketable quantity of a border-controlled drug and trafficking a controlled drug.The court heard he had a difficult upbringing, and was prescribed medication after he was diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).“After discovering that you were able to make money by selling your medication, you began doing so,” Judge Slattery said.“You were in high school at that time.”The judge said the offences currently before the court were similarly committed “with the primary goal of financial reward”.“I have determined that you played a principal role in organising the importation of multiple consignments of cocaine,” he said.Marshall recently completed a carpentry apprenticeship and was in the process of starting his own business.However, the court heard his sentence could not be suspended or served on home detention.Marshall, who arrived at court in a suit accompanied by supporters, was handed a term of four years, with a non-parole period of two years.

A day after President Donald Trump fired his defense secretary, the White House installed a Trump loyalist in a key Pentagon post on Tuesday and promoted another one who has falsely called former President Barack Obama a terrorist. Trump announced his dismissal of Defense Secretary Mark Esper on Twitter on Monday, signaling he may use his final months in office to settle scores within his administration. But the further reshuffling at the Pentagon is raising concern among Democrats about whether U.S. national security policy may become unsettled as Republican Trump exits office. It could also potentially make it easier for Trump to execute policies that Esper had opposed, such as deploying active duty troops to suppress street protests in the United States. Trump's move sent a dangerous message to America's adversaries and dimmed hopes for an orderly transition as Democratic President-elect Joe Biden prepares to take office, Democrats said. It is hard to overstate just how dangerous high-level turnover at the Department of Defense is during a period of presidential transition, said Representative Adam Smith, the Democrat who leads the House Armed Services Committee. Esper was replaced by Christopher Miller, who had been the director of the National Counterterrorism Center. The Pentagon said Kash Patel, who was the top counter-terrorism adviser on the White House National Security Council, would be Miller's chief of staff. Patel worked as a top aide to Representative Devin Nunes, the pro-Trump Republican who chaired the House Intelligence Committee and now is its top minority member. While working for Nunes, Patel helped produce a memo accusing the FBI and Department of Justice of bias against Trump. In the wake of Esper's departure, the Pentagon's top policy adviser resigned, allowing that post to be filled by Anthony Tata, a retired Army brigadier general who has called Obama a terrorist leader. Tata failed to secure a Senate confirmation hearing in August and was performing the duties of the deputy undersecretary of defense for policy. The reshuffle raises the possibility that Trump will try to make good on still unfulfilled campaign pledges before Jan. 20, when Biden takes office. Those include potentially ordering a full withdrawal of U.S. forces from Afghanistan. Representative Elissa Slotkin, a Democrat who served as a senior Pentagon official in the Obama administration, called on Miller to put national security interests ahead of loyalty to Trump, saying the country and the military he has dedicated his life to are counting on him to do the right thing.
