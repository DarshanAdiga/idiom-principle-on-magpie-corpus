PLYMOUTH - James Kernen spent years dreaming of playing football for Plymouth South. He first stepped onto the sideline during a game as 6-year-old, serving as the team's water boy. Season after season, he rarely missed a game, always waiting for the day when he could wear the black and teal. And when he finally did, he made the most of it.
 "He was this little skinny kid with glasses," remembers recently retired Head Football Coach Scott Fry.
 Kernen isn't little or skinny anymore. Now 6-foot-5 and 250 pounds, he was instrumental in leading the Panthers to the Division 4 Super Bowl last season, playing tackle on both sides of the ball. His play earned him a spot on the Patriot League All-Star team.
 "He dominated [opponents], but he's also a really good athlete," Fry said.
 Kernen was also selected to play in the prestigious Shriners High School All- Star Football Classic, which was scheduled to be played June 19 but was recently cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
 "It was an honor to be selected," he said. "It was a goal of mine since sophomore year. It was just really special for me and my family to be honored."
 Kernen's connection to the football program began when his childhood friend, Anthony Loranger, the son of wrestling coach Marc Loranger, asked him if he wanted to join him on the sidelines as the team water boy. "I said sure, and I did it every year, every game," he said.
 He was on the sidelines when the Panthers went to the 2013 Super Bowl, dreaming that it would be him someday. "I kept thinking when I get to that point, I want to do what they're doing, but better," he said.
 "Going into my sophomore year, I had no clue if I'd be playing," he said. "I just put my head down, worked out, tried to put on as much weight as I could and then see where the chips fell. When I started the first game, it was special to finally see all those dreams come to fruition."
 The fact that Kernen played tackle last season was testimony to his leadership qualities. When he first suited up at Plymouth South, he was a tight end. But Fry asked him to shift to the less-glamorous offense tackle position in his sophomore season. And after playing defensive end in his sophomore and junior years, Fry moved him to defensive tackle last season. Those are not the type of position changes many players would embrace, but Kernen did so without complaint.
 "He would do anything for the team," Fry said. "He had no problem doing whatever we needed him to do. He was the ultimate team player. He's probably one of the best captains I've ever had at South. He was all about winning football games, which is what made him such a good leader."
 By the time Fry asked him to switch position on defense last season, Kernen said, "I was kind of used to it at that point, so it just came naturally.
 "If it's best for the team, you just do it, no questions asked," he said.
 The highlight of Kernen's senior season came on Sept. 27 when the Panthers scored a touchdown with 16 seconds remaining to upset defending Super Bowl champion Scituate, 15-9.
 "This was a statement game for us," he said. "To come back in the last minute and score a touchdown … I've been around the program a long time and I think it was probably the loudest I'd heard that stadium in 11 years."
 The Panthers did not lose another game until the Super Bowl.
 A National Honor Roll student, Kernen will head to Assumption College in the fall to study business, with a focus on marketing. He'll also play football.
 "I think he'll be a phenomenal college player," Fry said. "He's just going to get better and better, because he has a tremendous work ethic."

_The following editorial first appeared in the Los Angeles Times._
 As business skyrockets for Amazon and other online shipping and delivery services during the pandemic, it’s tempting to ask whether it’s time to pull the plug on the U.S. Postal Service, with its every-door every-day delivery schedule, its bricks-and-mortar neighborhood service centers, its unwieldy pension burden and the enmity of President Donald Trump and much of the GOP establishment. It’s widely projected to become insolvent this year, with drop- dead estimates ranging from June to September, and in any case before October — when vote-by-mail ballots are due to go out in much (and perhaps all) of the nation.
 Trump’s dislike of the Postal Service is so intense that he reportedly threatened to veto the recent $2 trillion economic relief package if it included any postal bailout. Private airlines and other giant corporations, yes; the national lifeline that reaches virtually every American in good times and bad, no way.
 Yes, the agency is premodern — in a good way. When the electricity goes out, the cell tower is down or the internet isn’t working (all of which could easily happen during a natural disaster or enemy attack), the Postal Service and its employees are the nation’s vital link, as befits a publicly held resource. One emergency plan not (yet) in use is to have postal workers quickly deliver to each American an antidote like Cipro in the event of a wide-scale biological attack. Who else would be able to do that? As a recent Wired article notes, the plan could quickly and easily be retooled for a pandemic.
 The agency plays an essential role in urban and suburban areas, where postal workers are the ones who bring many of those Amazon packages to the front door. And in rural and hard-to-reach areas, postal workers are the only ones who provide regular delivery service because there’s not enough money in it for private courier businesses. Postal delivery is the only way many Americans can get their essential medications or pension checks — and yes, ballots, much to the chagrin of Trump, who accurately recognizes that broadening the voter base diminishes the election chances of Republicans like himself.
 The agency is a little like face masks, ventilators and test kits — national goods too easy to forget about when there is no emergency, and to economize into oblivion just before you need them.
 Congress has hamstrung the agency with an unsound plan to fund future retiree pensions. It also has prevented it from employing modern technologies or adding services that might compete with private companies. It should unleash the agency.
 In the short term, though, Congress should do exactly what should be done for the nation’s most essential services in times of emergency. It should properly fund the Postal Service to keep it serving us in normal times and to keep it ready for times like now.

 NAIRAB, Idlib, Syria (Reuters) - Taher al-Matar's home in northwest Syria is in ruins but he has gone back to live there anyway, driven by dire conditions in camps for displaced people, where he fears any outbreak of the coronavirus would be devastating.
 Even though he worries a fragile ceasefire in the Idlib region may not last, the Syrian father is clearing rubble from what's left of his house while looking out for any unexploded shells that could have fallen in the last government offensive.
 "It's better than living in the camps. We were there, we lived the humiliation," Matar, 42, told Reuters in the town of Nairab, where his house, close to a frontline dividing territory held by rebels from Russian-backed Syrian government forces, was destroyed by a missile three months ago.
 "They tell us to stay home because of corona ...but in the camps, the tents are right next to each other and people can't keep their distance."
 Matar wants to spend the holy month of Ramadan with his six children at home. "Praise God, I got them out unscathed," he said. "Now I'm making repairs with my own hands because I have no money."
 Like Matar, thousands of Syrians have started moving back to the Idlib region since a truce brokered by Russia and Turkey took effect in March, halting an offensive in the last remaining rebel stronghold.
 Nearly 1 million people were uprooted, many of whom had already fled other battles earlier in the nine-year war. While the region has no confirmed coronavirus cases, with little testing so far, doctors warn its ravaged hospitals and makeshift camps would quickly turn any outbreak into a catastrophe.
 A local relief agency said nearly 120,000 people had returned to towns in Idlib and the nearby Aleppo countryside since the ceasefire.
 "What will happen next, only God knows... At the end of the day, a person has nothing but his home," said Saher al-Ali, 32, a driver who also went back to Nairab to try fixing his house.
 Air strikes blew out all the windows and doors before his family escaped. After first fleeing to a camp on the border, he searched for other houses, but they were too full or expensive.
 "Where was I supposed to live? In the camps or in the street?... If the battles come back, we will flee again."

Trips to area farmers markets will look considerably different this year as vendors make changes because of the coronavirus.
 Gov. Jay Inslee’s stay-at-home order said farmers markets are essential. But Washington Farmers Markets Association Executive Director Colleen Donovan said customers should plan on a new approach to shopping to minimize health risks and maintain social distancing.
 “Try and have a shopping list,” Donovan said. “Try and shop as efficiently as possible so that you spend as little time in the market as possible.”
 She understands those directives fly in the face of what’s normally encouraged through free samples and friendly vendors open to conversation about their products. However, it’s the best way to ensure sellers can stay in business and keep providing valuable contributions to their local economies, she said.
 The significant steps necessary for farmers markets to adapt to a new environment forced many to postpone their scheduled May openings, including those in Ellensburg and Yakima. Yakima Farmers Market manager Don Eastridge still hopes to open the Union Gap market on
 May 23 but said that will depend on the governor’s orders and whether the Valley Mall can re-open.
 When they do re-appear, the markets will implement changes to encourage social distancing and minimize the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19. Donovan said she’s been working with health departments, officials and farmers market staff leaders throughout Washington as well as other states to help markets operate safely.

 (Reuters) - When stay-at-home orders sparked by the coronavirus forced him to find new ways to reach young voters ahead of the November U.S. election, Felix Clarke turned to an online computer game.
 The New Hampshire college student logged in to Minecraft, dressed his avatar in the blue T-shirt worn by canvassers for NextGen America, the progressive group for which he works, and strolled virtually up to other players, making his pitch.
 "I pretty much used the same conversation starters I'd use in-person talking to other students at Plymouth State," Clarke said via a NextGen spokeswoman. "We talked in-game mostly about how to vote, why as the largest chunk of eligible voters it is so important that young people make their voices heard."
 Political groups large and small have turned to digital campaigning amid the social distancing restrictions affecting almost all Americans, using texts, social media and video chat to carve out a new form of organizing as the U.S. presidential election looms.
 The election pits Republican Donald Trump against presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden in a campaign taking place against the all-consuming backdrop of the pandemic.
 Republican organizers switched from holding packed, raucous rallies to setting up livestreams and social media events with just 24-hours notice, said Trump campaign spokesman Ken Farnaso. About 1,000 staff and hundreds of thousands of volunteers have switched to digital outreach, he said, while others make voice calls from their homes instead of crowded phone banks.
 "We are hosting virtual events, training members of the Trump Neighborhood Teams online, activating the massive volunteer network to make calls on behalf of the President, and continuing our efforts to register voters online," Farnaso said in an email.
 Biden's campaign built a studio in the candidate's home in Delaware, where the former vice president streams podcasts and town halls, and makes television news appearances.
 Organizers recruit volunteers via text messages, and hold conference calls and video chats with voters led by such backers as strategist Symone Sanders, said Biden spokesman Vedant Patel.
 'VIRTUAL CLIPBOARDS'
 The Democratic party has trained 7,000 digital organizers over the past month and was connecting with voters using social media handles among other methods, chair Tom Perez said Friday.
 "We're not knocking on doors, but we have our virtual clipboards in hand, and we are engaging voters where they consume their news, talking about what we're fighting for," Perez told reporters.
 Reaching voters digitally - particularly younger voters who may be adept at technology and new media but jaded about politics - has involved a steep learning curve for some groups, and taken a lot of creativity, organizers said.
 Naseem Makiya, the founder of Outvote, an application for digital mobilizing, said his company had seen a dramatic uptick in inquiries.
 "When it's safe to organize door knocks and hold events, I think people will be really excited to go back to doing that ... (but) now they'll know there are these options digitally that can be just as impactful," he said.
 When Ohio's shelter-in-place order began in March, gay rights activist Brad Henry cast about for a way to salvage voter engagement efforts he had planned.
 At a neighbor's suggestion, Henry said, he decided to livestream dance parties involving DJs and bands to keep up that contact. On Saturday, his latest event featured drag performers Maja Jera and Jennifer Lynn as hosts and raised funds for healthcare workers on the front lines of the pandemic.
 Jen Miller, executive director of the Ohio League of Women Voters, also made an appearance.
 "Be a voter," she said via video from her home. "It's how we create a healthy democracy where everyone's voice is heard."
