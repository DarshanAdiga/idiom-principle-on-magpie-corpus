I am a relative newcomer to Kentucky, having moved here from Louisiana 29 years ago. My wife’s family has been in Hopkins County for more than 200 years. I am the descendant of a Confederate veteran.
 The question that the members of this Hopkins County Fiscal Court must weigh is this: Will we, as a community, allow a handful of vocal activists to erase our county’s history by making changes to the Madisonville town square in order to appease the feelings of those who believe that history has done them wrong?
 The question is a rhetorical one, because we as a community already did that. In 1909, we allowed the Daughters of the Confederacy to put up a monument whose purpose was just that — to erase, and rewrite history, so that they no longer had to live with the stigma assigned to the actions of the men in their families who chose to fight for the Confederacy.

Some folks might argue that this monument represents our county’s history. I would argue, strenuously, that it does not; that it blatantly and intentionally falsifies our county’s history in order to render noble the ignoble actions of a handful of men.
 The courthouse monument states, in prominent relief letters, that it is dedicated to our confederate dead. “They heard their country’s call,” it says. That is an out-and-out lie — a falsehood no matter how you sit.
 If you are of the opinion that the South was in open rebellion against its legitimate government, then these men did not fight for their country. They were traitors who fought an armed insurrection against the United States of America.
 If you take the other view, that the South had every right to secede and was a legitimate country defending itself from northern aggression, then these men were still traitors. Kentucky did not join the confederacy. If one is of the opinion that the Confederate States of America was a sovereign country, then that means that Kentuckians who fought for it left their homes to fight alongside foreign troops against American soldiers.
 It is the reason that Kentuckians were excluded from the general amnesty for Confederate soldiers. And it is the reason that the Daughters of the Confederacy worked so hard to erect monuments in every county of Kentucky; to deliberately erase this fact, and to try and rewrite history to reflect their favorable views of their fathers and husbands.
 Historically, this monument not only misrepresents the Confederate soldiers that it celebrates, but it misrepresents our county. The line of support for the confederacy ended about halfway up Christian County; Hopkins County, and Madisonville within it, were loyal to the United States of America, and for that loyalty we were attacked and our courthouse was burned.
 Putting a monument to the Confederates right in the spot where they attacked our town is akin to putting up a monument celebrating Al Qaeda where the Twin Towers once stood.
 But putting aside the deliberate ahistoricity of the monument, let us look to what it represents. To try and separate the institution of slavery from the confederacy is impossible; we have all heard the argument that the South was fighting for State’s Rights, but, leaving aside entirely the legitimacy of that argument, one of the rights that every single state in the confederacy sought to maintain was the ability to legally buy, sell, rape, torture, breed, and murder human beings.

DENVER (AP) — One hand watches the other. Bipartisan teams transport, verify, open, sort, count and store Colorado’s ballots — all in secure rooms with windows through which anyone can watch. Election judges and computers check each vote and signature against state registries before they’re tabulated and stashed by the hundreds in cardboard boxes, numbered and dated. No single person or party controls any portion of the process. Checks, balances and redundancies guard against fraud, interference and innocuous errors. Colorado’s mail-in voting system is as safe as it gets, local and national experts, election judges, Republicans and Democrats agree — despite efforts by President Donald Trump and others to question the security of voting by mail. Colorado is one of just five states employing an automatic vote-by-mail election system and many now wonder how the remaining 45 and the District of Columbia will handle the November election as the coronavirus pandemic continues. More and more eyes are turning to Denver to see how it’s done. — The ballots Alton Dillard nodded with apparent satisfaction as he watched a man lug a red metal lock box into a secure room inside the Denver Clerk and Recorder’s Office downtown during the June 30 primary.

"There's one!" 5-year-old Sam shouted with glee, as a bright green dragonfly darted around the algae loosely covering the edges of the lake.
   
 Three-year-old Max and 7-year-old Hannah scrambled over to spy the newly found "darting needle" as they are sometimes called. Such are the goings-on when taking three young anglers fishing off a dock on a beautiful, albeit hot, summer day.
   
 Of course, since the three were new to the sport, fishing poles had to be got, adding a few colorful worms with sparkles for bait, hooks, sinkers and a few other odds and ends. Pure joy to Nana and Granddad (pronounced Gandad, by these small fry).
   
 After casting practice on the grass with warnings about looking behind before sending the hook singing over the water to ensure a sibling wasn't caught in the cheek, the three raced to the dock cheeks doused white with sunblock, life vests snuggly fit across chests, hats on and poles in hand.
   
 Max was thoroughly satisfied to keep his yellow weighted practice fish on the line and simply drop it over the edge of the dock, watching it drop into the depths of the murky water until it disappeared. With large eyes, mouth in a circle, he would murmur "Ohhh" as it fell. Hannah and Sam had visions of pulling out 30-inch northern pike or 10-pound bass like the ones mounted in the small cabin beyond the lake.
   
 Hannah did catch a small bluegill and one of the largest green sunfish ever seen. It was definitely keeper size, but "catch and release" was the goal of the day. Pictures taken of Hannah and her fish were all that were needed. As the excitement of fishing ebbed and flowed, interest in bullfrog searches, dragonfly counts, other bug interests and mosquito slapping kept them busy.
   
 The weekend to the family farm in Iowa included tractor climbing and pretend driving, hiking, prairie flower identifying and walking up the road to the "deep dark forest." Funny how these city kids could walk several blocks to a park, but walking a country road called for the need to be carried by the nearest adult because their "legs were so tired!" Admittedly, it was awfully darned hot to be trudging up a steep hill in the sun.
   
 After dinner in the cabin, the small rowboat was always launched with the three adventurers. Voices were kept low in the hopes that deer, turkey and other wildlife would be seen as they traveled down to the water for their nightly drink. The scouts were always rewarded with numerous white-tailed deer sightings, fish jumping and other tales to eagerly share with Nana and Gandad. Game boards, cards and other entertainment came out in the evenings, before and after the three had been tucked to bed.
   
 Hours and hours were spent in the shade sorting rocks in the gravel driveway looking for the "prettiest" rocks. Drink cups overflowing with the choicest finds were clutched tightly in small hands as the car drove back home. There is no doubt that heavy eyelids fell on the way, as the excitement of the weekend drifted off into dreamland.

As the first week of “Race Week” was ending, Mr. Tafoya entered the race at the Lawrenceburg Speedway where he was able to bounce back from his last race disappointments by capturing a 14.722 during pole position, the ninth fastest time in his group. When it was time to race, he continued to turn heads when he placed fourth in his heat while competing against two of the USAC’s racers, automatically qualifying for the final race where he started and finished in the 19th spot.
 “Lawrenceburg was definitely the highlight of the trip,” Mr. Tafoya said. “We went straight into the A-Main Event from the heat race. I definitely like that fast track, and the roughness. Just had to be up on the wheel and ready to go. I was hoping to make the main straight through the heats, but I didn’t know if I could get it done (being the first time on the track).”
 After experiencing the highlight of his trip, he finished off the series with an encoring finish at the Terre Haute Action Track, placing 10th and eighth, respectively, in a couple of rained out events while racing against five of the top 10 racers in USAC National point standings, which was a very rewarding because he was able to gain some much-needed experience of that challenge. Since there isn’t much racing going on in California because of the COVID-19 pandemic, Mr. Tafoya and his team are looking forward to returning to the Midwest and compete in Indiana’s annual “Smackdown” race at the Kokomo Speedway Aug 27 to 29.

LANCASTER, S.C.

A pardon board in South Carolina unanimously voted to keep Kayla Marie Cook in prison, The Herald of Rock Hill reported. Cook was convicted in Lancaster County a year ago of homicide by child abuse for beating 3-year-old Lillian Schroeder in 2017. Cook told the board she had cancer in her neck and head and doctors have told her it is incurable. She was released on bond in 2018 while awaiting trial because she was getting cancer treatments. Family members of the girl and law enforcement investigators on the case asked that Cook remain in prison because of how badly the child was beaten and the severity of the crime, prosecutor Randy Newman said. South Carolina law said prisoners can ask for a pardon when they have less than a year to live because of a terminal illness.

NEW ORLEANS (AP) — Tulane University in New Orleans says researchers from its School of Architecture have been awarded a $15,000 grant to assist in designing new uses for African American schools in Louisiana that were abandoned in the wake of school desegregation. In a news release, the university said the biennial Richard L. Blinder Award, will allow researchers to work with alumni of the schools in designing reuse strategies for the buildings. According to the university, the mid-20th century structures were originally constructed as last-ditch efforts to protect segregation by providing “separate but equal” facilities for Black students. Many were closed after schools were desegregated, the release said. “For many years, these mid- century African American school buildings have sat vacant, many preferring they be forgotten and their history silenced,” said Laura Blokker, interim director of the Preservation Studies program at Tulane. Blokker and Andrew Liles, assistant professor of architecture, received the grant. The award was given through the Trustees of the James Marston Fitch Charitable Foundation, which Blinder, an architect, served as president. The project leaders aim to identify as many as possible of the surviving buildings. A team will identify potential new uses for the buildings and outline preservation and design recommendations. “A meeting of stakeholders from across the state will be convened to brainstorm about potential uses of schools in different communities,” the university release said. “Some of the ideas that have been discussed include community centers and senior housing facilities.”

 Even after these cells unite, the newly fertilized egg must take root in the uterine wall — this is called implantation. This can be a tricky process. Research shows that about two thirds of lost pregnancies happen due to implantation failure.
 Normal implantation can be an asymptomatic process or it can be accompanied by light bleeding (for more information on that, check out our article Is this Spotting My Period or am I Pregnant? _)._

ANKARA, Turkey (AP) — Turkish air and naval forces conducted joint training exercises in the Aegean Sea, the country’s Defense Ministry said Saturday, amid strains with neighbor Greece over hydrocarbon discoveries. F-16 fighter jets took part alongside warships to “enhance, maintain and improve the operational capability of joint inter-forces operations,” the ministry tweeted. The announcement came as NATO members Turkey and Greece are facing off in the eastern Mediterranean Sea over gas and oil exploration and a day after Turkey declared significant gas discoveries in the Black Sea. Two weeks ago, Turkey sent a warship-escorted research vessel to prospect in waters where Greece claims exclusive rights to the underlying seabed. Athens responded by sending its own warships to the area and placing its military on alert. France also sent warships and planes to join drills with Greek forces. Greek officials said Friday that the United Arab Emirates would also dispatch fighter jets to the southern Greek island of Crete for joint training next week. Relations between Greece and Turkey have traditionally been tense. The two have come to the brink of war three times since the mid-1970s, including once over drilling exploration rights in the Aegean Sea that separates the two countries. French relations with Turkey are strained over Ankara’s involvement in Libya’s civil war. The UAE is a bitter rival of Turkey in a broader struggle over political Islam, while Abu Dhabi and Ankara back rival factions in Libya.

“How can we discern the signs of the times, Bevel asked? How can we not recognize that the hour has arrived for black men and women to claim what is rightfully their own — indeed the right to vote?” Marsh writes of the sermon. “Our demand is that we not ignore the clear signs before our eyes. God’s time is upon us; let us not back down from the challenge.”
 A few weeks later, Hamer and 17 others rode a bus some 24 miles to Indianola, Miss., to register to vote. It took three attempts at literacy tests designed to disenfranchise Blacks and the payment of poll taxes for Hamer to obtain voting rights. As a reward for her efforts, she and her husband were kicked off the plantation where they worked. She faced death threats and endured a severe beating that left her with lasting kidney damage.
 The terror visited upon her did not hinder her activism. Instead, she co- founded the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party and pushed to be recognized as the delegation from Mississippi at the 1964 Democratic National Convention. At her speech before the credentials committee, Hamer asked questions that resonate: “Is this America, the land of the free and the home of the brave, where we have to sleep with our telephones off the hooks because our lives be threatened daily, because we want to live as decent human beings, in America?”
 Her words linked voting, the opportunity to make our concerns known, to life. She wanted to know if America wanted Blacks to live and flourish in this country or simply pick its cotton and shuck its corn. Those who look upon what continues to happen to Black people in this country still find ourselves asking, “Is this America?” Is America the place that shoots Black women who are asleep in their homes or stalks Black men in pickup trucks? How can we vote for hope and against terror except through concrete policies designed to expand Black freedom?
 Although her efforts at the 1964 convention were unsuccessful, Hamer dedicated her energy to helping the SNCC (Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee) and the SCLC (Southern Christian Leadership Conference) expand voting rights to others. Many voting registration drives such as the one that inspired Hamer occurred in Black churches. Hamer described her activism as rooted in her Christian faith.
 After American women obtained the right to vote 100 years ago, many Black Christian women such as Hamer fought against restrictions that kept them from the same voting booths as White women. Much attention has been rightly paid to the late congressman John Lewis for his historic role in voting rights activism, but Americans should also familiarize themselves with Hamer’s story.
 The fight for voting access is one way that Black Christians have lived out their faith in the public square. But when one constructs a list of issues that religious voters care about, voting rights is not often mentioned.

 Arriving at Heathrow on Saturday, Neringa Juskauskaite, 27, from Woolwich, in south-east London, said: "It was all a complete rush, we weren't given enough time to get home and there were no flights back on Friday, it would have been useful to have a few more days but it is what it is.

GALESBURG -- Max Snell doesn't get to play football for Quincy University this fall.
   
 And it's not because the 2016 Galesburg High School grad, who played for the Silver Streaks, is dealing with an injury.
   
 The 22-year-old is healthy as can be, but due to the coronavirus pandemic, the Hawks, members of the Great Lakes Valley Conference, won't take the gridiron until this spring.
   
 Snell, a senior, will be ready when the NCAA Division II squad is finally able to battle. He always is.
   
 "I am just excited to play football whenever I can. It doesn't matter to me when the timing is," Snell said Tuesday afternoon via cellphone from Quincy. "I was hoping to play this fall, but everyone needs to be safe and that's the concern for everybody. I'm just excited. It just gives me four more months to get ready, to be honest.
   
 "We will do running and weightlifting as a team, but even if we don't, then I will do it on my own," he added. "I was in Quincy the whole summer trying to get ready. I'm always trying to stay in shape. You have to always be working to improve because if you're not getting better, then you're getting worse."
   
 Snell, a 6-foot-5, 315-pound offensive lineman, will play a key role for the Hawks, and he's got a great bond with Quincy coach Gary Bass.
   
 "I was lucky enough to have gotten the opportunity to recruit him while I was the offensive coordinator and offensive line coach prior to becoming the head coach here at Quincy. I know his family very well and have the privilege of also being his position coach even now," Bass said of Snell. "Max is an old school offensive lineman that is extremely physical and plays with a violent disposition. If you know him as a person that would shock you because he comes across more as a big teddy bear. However, as an offensive lineman, as I was, you have to be a protector by nature with the position.
   
 "He has played four out five positions along the line since his freshman year. He has been a three-year starter and someone that our offensive line looks to as a senior leader this year," Bass added. "He has been an absolute pleasure to coach, and to be honest, I am in disbelief that is almost time for him to graduate. He was an all-conference performer for us last year and is slated to start at left guard this year."
   
 Bass has instilled a new offensive game plan, and the Hawks, who went 5-6 overall and 2-5 in league affairs in 2019, lost a few members from last year's team, according to Snell, who dons No. 69 for Quincy.
   
 "It will be some different guys stepping up and being leaders," he said. "A team goal will be managing to still come together and have chemistry even though we are not going to be physically together this fall."
   
 And Snell's personal goals?
   
 "Just be the best teammate I can be," said Snell, who sat out as a redshirt in the 2016 season. "This university and this football program have given me so much.
   
 "It's an extra year for me, so I'm just looking to give back and make a lasting impact on my team. I want to step up and be a better leader on and off the field."
   
 Once his career concludes, Snell, an exercise science major with an emphasis in human performance, doesn't plan to walk away from a sport he's played since he was a fourth-grader.
   
 "I would love to go into coaching football at some level either college or high school," Snell said. "Other than that I am not really sure what is next.
   
 "Football has been a massive part of my life, and I know I'm definitely going to be coaching no matter what I do."

A pair of tropical cyclones forecast to become hurricanes early next week are headed for the U.S. Gulf Coast and will spin over the Gulf’s warm waters simultaneously, a rare weather event that could cause massive disruption as they make landfall.
 There have never been two hurricanes in the U.S Gulf of Mexico at the same time, according to the National Hurricane Center. The closest event was in 1933, when a major hurricane made landfall in south Texas while a separate hurricane weakened to a tropical storm after crossing the Florida Peninsula, the NHC said.
 The last time two cyclones were in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico was in 2002, when Tropical Storm Fay and Tropical Depression Edouard overlapped for about 18 hours, according to the NHC.
 Tropical Storm Laura and a separate tropical depression brewing near Honduras could approach the Gulf Coast as hurricanes next week in an area spanning Texas to the Florida Panhandle, according to the National Hurricane Center.
 Meteorologists say there is still a lot of uncertainty around the systems and how they develop and move in coming days, particularly as they cross land.
 Both storms currently look on track to remain separate, however, any interaction between the two could change their intensity or trajectory, said Dan Kottlowski of AccuWeather. It is unlikely they would combine, he added.
 “More than likely one will become stronger, and inflict more vertical wind shear causing the other to weaken,” Kottlowski. “But if they stay of equal strengthen, then they will probably prevent each other from getting really strong.”
 In some cases when storms interact, they can orbit each other and the speed of one cyclone could accelerate the other, part of something known as the “Fujiwhara effect,” said David Streit of Commodity Weather Group.
 Tropical Storm Laura, which is currently east of the Antilles, was upgraded from a depression on Friday and has sustained winds of 45 miles per hour (72 kph), according to the NHC. Laura is forecast to make landfall as a hurricane on Wednesday.
 Tropical Depression 14, which would be named Marco if it strengthens, is on track to make landfall on Tuesday near the Texas and Louisiana border. It would arrive around the three-year anniversary of Hurricane Harvey, which dumped a record 50 inches (127 cm) of rain on parts of Houston in August 2017 and caused billions of dollars in damage.

Hearts and Scotland defender John Souttar has suffered another injury blow.
 The 23-year-old’s club announced he had suffered a “relapse of an Achilles injury”.
 A brief statement added: “The Scotland defender will go for a scan, which will present a clearer picture of the extent of his injury.”
 The former Dundee United player was carried off on a stretcher with an Achilles injury during Hearts’ Scottish Cup win over Rangers on February 29.
 Souttar had already missed several months of the season with an ankle problem.
 The centre-back, who has three Scotland caps, previously suffered a ruptured Achilles in January 2017, which ruled him out for the rest of that season.

Concord, N.H. (AP) — A regional coalition that supports the development of offshore wind power is set to launch later this month. New England for Offshore Wind, which includes environmental advocacy organizations, educational institutions, justice and health organizations, and business alliances, will hold a press conference Wednesday to announce the launch. The group will argue that offshore wind is necessary to address growing energy demands, as more power plants go off line in the coming years. Speakers from all six New England states will be at the virtual press conference. The federal Bureau of Ocean Energy Management is currently weighing concerns from commercial fishermen, environmentalists, coastal communities and other stakeholders before deciding where leases on the Outer Continental Shelf in the Gulf of Maine might be allocated and where they wouldn’t be allowed. The first offshore wind farm is still six to 10 years from operation. Still, supporters including New Hampshire Republican Gov. Chris Sununu have touted the economic benefits of offshore wind and said the region could be model for other parts of the country. Others have said offshore wind could help their states meet ambitious renewable energy goals. But commercial fishermen have expressed concerns and cautioned the federal government to move slowly and ensure their decisions were based on sound science.

He is mystified by White evangelicals support of Trump, which many say is because the president has appointed conservative judges and sided with conservative religious groups in legal and political disputes.
 “Evangelicals sold out” to Trump, Perkins said. “That created a split in the church.”
 Other Black leaders are drawing their own lines in the sand. Charlie Dates, a prominent pastor from Chicago, said he recently felt uncomfortable when invited to speak on the same radio station with White evangelical pastors Robert Jeffress and John MacArthur, who support Trump and decry “social justice.”
 Dates said many White evangelicals prefer to emphasize unity, which he said allows them to overlook systemic racial inequity. “There’s no repentance in the conversations about reconciliation,” he said.
 For Black Pentecostal speaker and author Brenda Salter McNeil, the 2016 election made 30 years of talking about racial reconciliation feel like “a waste.” She began to speak out more specifically on systemic issues like immigration, the lack of clean water in Flint, Mich., and police brutality.
 A year ago, McNeil said, a White middle-aged man posted a message on her Facebook page that said: “We liked you better when you just quoted Bible verses.”
 Black authors and speakers say demand for their training and consulting has skyrocketed this summer as people are hungry for information. These leaders are willing — on their own terms.
 On Friday at noon, author and speaker Lisa Sharon Harper will moderate a live discussion with three other Black Christian educators about the most pressing issues around faith and racial equity. Harper said nearly 500 people have already signed up to watch the livestream, which will be open to the public.
 With a grant for nearly $1 million from Facebook, one of those educators, Latasha Morrison, created heavily moderated Facebook groups for thousands of people to discuss race. Participants are not allowed to say anything until they have observed the discussion for three months and completed a specially designed curriculum.
 “We were saying these things about race a decade ago, but no one was listening,” said Morrison, whose 2019 book “Be the Bridge” became a bestseller this summer. “Trump did not invent racism. Has he fueled it and poured some oil on it? Yes.”
 During the summer protests over racial justice, former NFL linebacker Emmanuel Acho launched a video series called “Uncomfortable Conversations with a Black Man”; his first recording was viewed 11 million times on Instagram. The son of a Black pastor who grew up in an affluent White neighborhood and has attended predominantly White evangelical churches, Acho believes White Christians have been able to live in ignorance.
 “Some Christians say, ‘It’s not about race, it’s about grace. It’s not about skin, it’s about sin,’ ” Acho said in an interview. “It’s hard for Black people to attend predominantly White churches, specifically when White pastors are silent on the issues that matter to Black people.”
 Some White evangelicals are looking to do more than push racial reconciliation or general awareness of racial discrimination. Greg Thompson, a white pastor based in Charlottesville, said that six months ago when he told people he was working on a book on reparations for a Christian publisher, he would get blank stares. Now, he said, his phone is ringing daily with people wanting to know more about to possibility of making payments to Black Americans.
 “My hope is that white supremacy and reparations will roll off the tongue as easily as race and racial reconciliation once did,” said Thompson, who did his doctoral dissertation on the Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr.
 The book “The Color of Compromise” by Jemar Tisby, about White Christian complicity in racism, became a national bestseller in June, 18 months after it was released. There are a host of other books out this year examining Christianity and racism, including “White Too Long” by Robert P. Jones, “Jesus and John Wayne,” by Kristin Kobes Du Mez, “Reconstructing the Gospel,” by Jonathan Wilson-Hartgrove and “Taking America Back for God,” by Andrew Whitehead and Samuel Perry.
 Tisby said it now seems less risky for White pastors to speak against racial injustice since major corporations have gotten on board. But some other Black Christians are remain skeptical, especially with the presidential campaign in full swing.
 “We’re seeing Black Christians say to White Christians, ‘You’re welcome on this journey, but we’re not waiting,’ ” Tisby said.

WASHINGTON, Pa. (AP) — “I always enjoyed school, and I enjoyed learning. I knew early on that academics was more of my route, and I was fortunate to have a family that encouraged me,” said Campbell, an English teacher at Washington High School. Campbell’s passion for learning was also nurtured by his teachers. But when he got into high school, it struck Campbell, who is Black, that other than his elementary and middle school gym teachers, he hadn’t been taught by a person of color throughout his academic career in the Washington School District, where minority students make up nearly 50% of the student body. “High school was a reality check. I looked around and realized in 10th grade that my world history teacher was the first teacher of color I had in a core class,” he said. After he graduated from the University of Pittsburgh at Greensburg, Campbell, 33, returned to his alma mater, where he has spent the last 11 years sharing his love for literature and serving as a role model for his students – especially students of color. “I aspire to be a role model for all of my students, but especially for my minority students, because I know how difficult it can be to be a Black male in this country,” said Campbell. “What upsets me is the low expectations people have for African American children.

However, Clarke said he was so “miserable” at that time and it was something that had to be done. He knew he was in good hands.
 “I knew going in, once I was on the ventilator, it was going to be kind of touch and go,” he said. “And apparently, talking to some of my nurse practitioners, a few days there was really pretty bad, but I told them, ‘God still has plans for me’ and I think he listened to all these prayers.”
 Clarke was eventually extubated on July 20, which left him “very weak.”
 He struggled to hold a popsicle afterward and still felt short of breath in following days. He underwent physical therapy and occupational therapy exercises to bolster his weakened strength, before going home on July 30 to a heartwarming farewell celebration at the hospital.
 Baptist Health employees applauded for Clarke, who works for Baptist Health Medical Group, as a health care worker guided him to the hospital’s exit after discharge. He exchanged “elbow bumps” and air elbow bumps with many of them as he left. The experience brought him to tears.
 “As of August 1st, I’ve been there at Baptist for 34 years,” he said. “It just brought tears to my eyes. I just couldn’t believe it. Still, when I think about it, it still kind of breaks me up. It really was something to see that. I feel like I’m part of the family.”
 Now, weeks later, Clarke still requires supplemental oxygen and he gets short of breath with exertion. But, his strength is better and his lungs need to heal. The healing process can take several months with a “bad viral pneumonia,” and he’s hoping to get back to work.
 Clarke also thanked everyone at the hospital — ranging from doctors, nurses and respiratory therapists to physical and occupational therapists and other hospital workers — and appreciates all the prayers, as evident in the many “get well soon” cards, balloons, gift baskets and signs on display at his Melber home this week.
 He stressed the importance of social distancing and wearing face masks to protect others, urging people to be altruistic and think of their fellow man and woman.
 “If I have it and don’t know it, I don’t want to give it to somebody else,” Clarke added.
 “The thing that made me feel the worst about this is I infected my wife, because by the time I knew I had it, she’d already been exposed. I feel terrible about that — that because of me, she got sick. Think about wearing a mask. I know it’s uncomfortable at times, but it’s a small thing to do to try to ... keep the virus from spreading. This virus is real.”

London and its environs are home to a notable diversity of faiths and flocks. Rites that have been the bedrock of their beliefs for centuries had to evolve swiftly during the pandemic lockdown to be safe and relevant for the faithful amid global uncertainty.
   
 In the Hertfordshire county village of Northchurch, Anglicans normally worship in the more than 1,000-year-old St. Mary's Church. That ended March 24 when the Church of England closed all its buildings, and Canon Rev. Jonathan Gordon began recording and broadcasting weekly services via smartphone with the help of Rachel Gordon, his wife.
   
 "It posed an immediate and immense challenge," the Rev. Gordon said. "It meant that we had to completely rethink how we did everything."
   
 In Neasden, a suburb northwest of London, a magnificent Hindu temple of carved stone constructed according to ancient Vedic architectural texts usually welcomes thousands of visitors a day. Now the BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir gets just a trickle of devotees who book appointments online first to keep the crowds down and are told to wear face masks.
   
 Everywhere there are reminders of the unusual times: Instead of donation boxes, smart screen devices flashing images of Hindu deities allow for contactless donations, and after each prayer session, workers in full-body protective suits swoop in to spray and sanitize any surface that may have been touched.
   
 On a recent day at a suburban home in Hemel Hempstead, three female members of the Patel family dressed in their best saris watched attentively in their living room as Hindu swamis and gurus spoke to them through their video screen. "That is what we would have worn to the temple," said Hemali Patel, "so it felt only right to dress for the occasion."
   
 Taking worship services virtual has been particularly challenging for the Orthodox Jewish community, members of which are proscribed from using electronics on Shabbat, their day of rest. Rabbi Mordechai Chalk broadcasts video services from his home Fridays just before sunset, as Shabbat nears.
   
 "L'chaim," he toasted in Hebrew recently, connected to the congregation via Zoom. His children ran into the picture in their pajamas to peer curiously at his laptop, before Shira Chalk, his wife, whisked them away for a bedtime story.
   
 Nestled in the Chiltern Hills northwest of London, the Buddhist Amvrati monastery decided to simply close its doors and retreat inward to protect the communal way of life of its yellow-robed monks.
   
 The monastery, whose name translates from the sacred Buddhist language of Pali as "deathless realm," takes delivery drops at the back gate, and it took multiple rounds of negotiations before an AP journalist was allowed to enter, wearing a mask and gloves and observing strict social distancing.
   
 Spokesman Ajahn Dhammanando said the reopening of the temple as the United Kingdom emerges from coronavirus lockdowns will happen with the utmost caution to avoid spreading COVID-19, and for the time being only for certain functions such as funeral ceremonies.
   
 At the Cambridge Central Mosque in the city of the same name, Imam Ali Tos has found solace in a slow reopening and the mosque's essential role in the lives of the faithful. Mats are now spaced a meter and a half apart during communal prayers, and worshippers are asked to bring their own. People's names and numbers are meticulously collected for possible contact-tracing purposes.
   
 "The mosque is not only a place of worship for Muslims," the imam said, "it is the center of our lives."
   
 Rabbi David Mason, who heads an Orthodox synagogue in North London, recalled going to a Jewish cemetery to preside over a funeral and being "aghast" at the rows of new graves, often several people being interred the same day.
   
 "It really hit me, you know, the number of dead that we've got," Mason said. "And that's one cemetery of many."
   
 But religions have endured trauma countless times before, and indeed, many of the tenets of faith held dear today were born out of hardship and suffering. And today's pandemic has not been without its lighter moments.
   
 Mason said he took joy from knowing tech-savvy volunteers were spending hours on the phone patiently helping older community members get online for services.
   
 "My high point during lockdown was when a 90-year-old lady came onto a Sunday night talk and explained how delighted she was," the rabbi said. "That's how communal collaboration works. I watched it work, and it was just wonderful."

The pandemic has created a potentially unstable college sports system after years of athletic departments and universities holding the power, money and resources.
 Eddie R. Cole, a UCLA associate professor of higher education and historian who authored “The Campus Color Line: College Presidents and the Struggle for Black Freedom,” said college athlete activism hasn’t been this rampant in 60 years.
 “We should be mindful we didn’t just arrive at this moment,” he said. “It’s not unique. Students have made their concerns known about the amateur model, if you will. But for some time academic leaders have stood at this crossroads, hoping it would blow over. At this particular time there’s no way around it. A decision must be made.”
 North Carolina switched to online learning this week after students returned to campus and COVID-19 outbreaks took the school to the brink of its quarantine housing capacity with 177 positive cases. The university decided fall athletes could remain on campus to practice for upcoming seasons.
 Michigan State also transitioned plans for in-person learning to remote classes but also said athletes could stay on campus to practice. Notre Dame pivoted to a two-week period of online classes after a rapid outbreak, but the football team, playing in the ACC this season, will continue workouts after a brief pause.
 These examples could poke a legal hole in the amateurism argument predicated on athletes being treated the same as other students — and not as employees.
 “There is so much public pressure on (universities) to get campuses functioning, there’s a moment for athletes to absolutely ask to have this model revisited and dismantled and put together in a way that’s equitable,” Cole said. “There’s an urgency to it. If you’re a professional sports league, yes, you pay athletes millions and you get testing everyday in the (NBA) Orlando bubble. But if you are a university that has severely mismanaged athletic funding for decades — in the sense that if you make a dollar, you go spend $2 for the rationale of ‘(we) can’t pay athletes’ — and you see that if you can’t have one season, the whole model is going to collapse? Then it’s not a sustainable model.”
 The tables could be shifting, similar to college campuses being used during racial and political movements of the 1960s, Cole said.

Your domain name is considered as your address on the internet. Simply put, your audience will be able to find you by knowing your domain name. Thus, you must pick a domain name that is not only unique but one that is easy to remember as well. In this case, a short one will prove to be more beneficial than a long domain name. Also ensure that it is easy to type, which means that you need to steer clear of using hyphens, numbers, or double letters. It is also a good idea if your domain name somehow reflects what you are writing about in your blog.

MACON, Ga. (AP) — Strolling through downtown Macon with a cocktail is no longer limited to Fridays. The Macon-Bibb County Commission has temporarily relaxed liquor laws to allow open containers of alcohol outside in downtown areas from 4 p.m. to 10 p.m. every night for the rest of the year, local news outlets report. Commissioners say they're trying to help businesses that have been hit by a decline in patronage because of COVID-19. Previously, outdoor drinking was allowed only during events of the first Friday of each month. “This supports the health of entrepreneurship and those business owners that are suffering,” said Mayor Pro Tem Al Tillman “It’s time for us to get on board and let’s help our businesses any way we can.” Drinks must be bought in designated cups from certain businesses and people must wear a wristband proving that it's legal for them to drink. Three commissioners opposed the plan, saying it could cause further spread of COVID-19 and other problems. “I want everybody to be able to survive down there but I don’t see it seven days a week, especially on Sunday,\" Commissioner Mallory Jones said. \"I think you’re going to have a hard time with enforcement. You’re going to encourage activities you don’t want.” Mayor Robert Reichert told commissioners that downtown group NewTown Macon will watch out for problems.

Readers will be delving into my world. They’ll be reading about Juliet that the screens don’t show and the media had no idea about. Readers will also use my stories and experiences in A Toast To Life to understand that they’re not alone in the world and can use their own experiences to become better instead of dealing with it alone and thinking that’s the worst thing that could happen to them. My book will motivate and inspire them in every aspect of life. It can be purchased anywhere in the world.

We no longer think the world is flat, but we still struggle to imagine a world beyond our own experience (known to behavioural economists as availability bias). Our tendency to overstate the amount of time we spend with social media is partly because we observe other people consuming media when they are out and about (staring down at their smartphones), but rarely get to see how others consume media at work or at home (listening to the radio during breakfast or watching the evening news).

The authorities, particularly the leadership of the Nigerian Police Force must be charged to put a stop to such killings of innocent citizens. No nation, except banana republics can afford to watch those charged with the sacrosanct order.of protecting its citizens turn against the same citizenry for no just cause. The Inspector General of Police, Mohammed Adamu must go beyond the solution of stun guns as his predecessor proferred during his tenure, rather we must insist that officers are properly trained and educated to understand the demands of their duties. Also, asides from dismissing officers, one thinks that holding commanders and DPO’s whose officers misbehave responsible for such gory events should do more to check these killings too.
