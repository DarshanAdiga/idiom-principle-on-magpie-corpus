"articleBody": "BILOXI, Miss. (WLOX) - After more than 300 students were placed in quarantine for COVID-19, Biloxi High School switched to a total virtual learning platform. Officials with Biloxi High School said that a combination of social gatherings and COVID-19 has forced their campus into change, which started Tuesday. A letter to parents said the reason for the change was to allow students to be distanced from one another and to stop the spread of the virus within the school. School officials said that the transition was seamless and gives students the same schedule they would have if they were in-person.“We are running a seven-period day, on our regular seven-period schedule with those bells ringers, those teachers doing their bell ringers, and they’re doing it all virtual. It’s an outstanding piece that we have in place to be able to switch to that with confidence,” said Principal Teresa Martin. “First and foremost is the safety of our students and our staff. It is no secret about what is going on in the world right now, of course, you know, Biloxi, Mississippi is not excluded from that.”
