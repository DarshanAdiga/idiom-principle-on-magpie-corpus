Elections officials, ballot suppliers and security researchers say such problems do occur with some regularity. They don’t indicate fraud, they say, but rather human error.


  WHAT IS HAPPENING?


  About 100,000 absentee ballots with the wrong names and addresses printed on the return envelopes were sent to voters in Brooklyn, N.Y., in late September. Ballots returned in envelopes bearing different names would risk being voided.


  The city’s election board blamed the ballot-printer, Phoenix Graphics of Rochester, N.Y., which said without elaborating that it “experienced mechanical-inserting issues” in what was its first ballot-printing run for the affected counties.

For those of you who aren’t aware, my father passed away this past summer due to complications from COVID-19. He was 83 and had diabetes. He managed to get through the COVID, but he had a heart attack and a stroke, and later his kidneys failed. Despite that, he had doctors, who helped him manage his pain, and at the end of the day, he was at rest when he made his transition.
 Now, as much as I have my own issues with the president, I don’t wish COVID-19 on anyone. It is a dangerous disease that has the potential to take you out. And if you are older than the age of 65, and the president is in his 70s, you are a lot more likely to feel the effects of COVID-19 if you contract it. I wish him and his wife nothing but the best for a speedy recovery.
 While I want the president and the first lady to recover, I hope they and their supporters learn something from this. Three things I hope they learn are to wear a mask, to social distance and to wash your hands or use hand sanitizer. This isn’t hard, folks. If you wear a mask, you decrease your chances of spreading the disease. This comes in handy if you’re asymptomatic and can spread the disease even when you don’t know you have it.
 Second, I realize there are quite a few people who have (or in this case had) a problem with the stay-at-home orders and other COVID-19 government-related mandates. So did I, particularly here in Marion County, where bars have to close at midnight, even though the Indianapolis infection rate is under 5%. But once again, the point of the mandates and the rules are to save lives, control the spread, and make sure hospital facilities aren’t overrun with COVID-19 patients.

Solar power pumps are devices that majorly run on electricity generated through photovoltaic cells. These cells mainly collect the incident solar energy, which further gets converted into electric energy through various processes. Solar powered pumps are known to be widely economical in the long run as compared to electrical powered pumps majorly due to less operational costs and low maintenance expenses. Solar powered pumps also have less environmental impact than the pumps that run on electricity. Thus, looking at these advantages, these pumps are gradually being used in a large numbers, thus constituting a distinct solar pumps market from a global perspective.

Although the letter doesn’t say how the information was obtained, it’s somewhat specific as to the time of collection. The letter attempts to be vague by stating the reporting was collected in “late July 2016,” but it reveals even more than that. According to the letter, Brennan told Obama that, according to the Russian reporting, Clinton allegedly approved this campaign plan on July 26, 2016—although Brennan’s handwritten notes indicate that it could have been July 28. In either case, if this alleged Clinton approval was on July 26 or 28, and the information was obtained by the intelligence community in “late July,” that leaves a three- to five-day window in which the information was collected and relayed back to the U.S. government. Revealing this temporal specificity—combined with the detailed substance of the reporting that was disclosed—would easily allow the Russian government to determine the intelligence unit from which the U.S. obtained the material. Based on those leads, it won’t be that hard for Russia to figure out how the U.S. obtained that information, thereby compromising the source or method that the U.S. successfully deployed against this extraordinarily hard target—which was apparently providing the U.S. with internal Russian intelligence in near real-time. Even if Russia doesn’t figure this out, the U.S. intelligence community will have already pulled back the collection source or method based on the letter, rendering it useless. It’s been reported that the heads of the CIA and the National Security Agency lobbied against Ratcliffe’s disclosure, presumably for these reasons.

Consider what was taking place in full public view in the spring and summer of 2016. In May 2016, Trump had hired Paul Manafort to run his campaign—prompting extensive reporting about Manafort’s deep connections to Russian and Ukrainian oligarchs, who in turn had ties to Russian intelligence. In mid-June 2016, the DNC hack, and the fact that Russia was behind it, was publicly reported. The next month, the Trump campaign worked behind the scenes to weaken the Republican National Committee platform on Ukraine in a manner that benefited Russia, with this coming after Trump had made a series of positive remarks about Putin during the campaign. On July 22, WikiLeaks began releasing the hacked DNC emails, right before the DNC nominating convention kicked off. Two days later, Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook went on CNN and alleged that the Russians hacked the DNC in order to help Trump, noting that Trump’s positions on NATO and Ukraine were favorable to Russia.

Many also cited geopolitical events as heightening uncertainty. In addition, most forecasters were assuming that an additional pandemic-related fiscal package would be approved this year, and noted that, absent a new package, growth could decelerate at a faster-than- expected pace in the fourth quarter. In light of these and other risks, as well as the ongoing pandemic, market participants continued to suggest that the supportive policy environment and the backstops to market functioning remained important stabilizers.

I voted in favor of submitting it to Kentucky voters for ratification or rejection. Our state is long overdue in the redistricting of judicial districts. With the lack of uniformity in terms of Commonwealth's attorneys and district judges, it has proven difficult for the Supreme Court of Kentucky and the General Assembly to ensure each region's needs are met. By marrying the two terms and making their elections coincide, both positions will be filled at the same time.   Furthermore, the eight years as a licensed attorney requirement will provide that candidates for the job are adequately prepared to take on the many and growing demands placed on holders of this position. I have heard from several people who are very concerned about giving these officials eight-year terms. I encourage you to read the amendment closely before making your decision to vote “yes” or “no.”

This incident happened during my first year of college, which is now 45 years in the past. For some reason, the day has stayed in my memory.


  It was the carpentry shop supervisor Velayudan who suggested it in the first place. “The Adyar Banyan Tree is the biggest tree in the world,” he said, “It has been there since pre-historic times and it covers 5 acres.”


  His buddies nodded in agreement, but they had a brief debate about whether the correct Tamil name was _aala maram_ or _arali maram_. When I looked it up later, it was not so far from the truth, although you could quibble about the details.


  On a typical sweltering Madras afternoon not soon after this discussion, I set out on my wobbly Atlas bicycle to see the famous banyan tree. It wasn’t far from our campus, but the Theosophical Society grounds were harder to find than I thought. In typical Madras fashion, everyone I asked said “just go straight”. I had almost given up in favour of a tender coconut, but the vendor pointed me to the entrance. A further kilometre or so inside the sprawling grounds and there it was.


  There was only one other group there, which looked like an extended family, with an older man, some middle-aged people and two young girls. I left my bike unlocked (it would only take one blow with a stone to break that lock anyway) and walked around. The tree was big, very big. There was a sign saying it was over 400 years old (not quite pre-historic) and the oldest in the world. I figured it must have been planted about the time Babar fought the battle of Panipat. It covered about an acre — not the five that Velayudan claimed, but an acre is plenty big for a single tree. It wasn’t until I saw the giant redwoods of California years later that I was so impressed by a tree.


  I sat on the stone bench, watching the other visitors. The two young girls were perhaps 10 and 6 years old. They wore identical tops and jeans. Even on that hot day, they both had more energy than me, clearly much more than their grown-up family. The older girl was clearly the boss, and the younger one seemed to accept this.


  “Who are you?” The older girl asked me.


  “My name is Krishna, I go to college nearby. What are you doing here?”


  “My sister and I are visiting thatha. I am 11 years old, my sister is 6 years old. We live in California. Have you seen the giant redwood trees?”


  “No, I have never been to California. In fact, I have never left India. But I will someday. I want to go to Chicago.”


  “Chicago is not in California. My mom teaches in Berkeley. Have you heard of it? I am in grade five, my sister is in grade one. I can do multiplication. Ask me a question.”


  “I am sure you can. But what are you doing in Madras?”


  “We came to visit Thatha. We come to Madras every year. Thatha and my chittis take us to the beach and tell us good stories. We love to walk on Marina Beach. It is the longest beach in the world. Have you seen the Gandhi statue? We like to get peanuts on the beach, but they call them groundnuts. Amma thinks it will make us sick but it doesn’t. I love eating masala dosas at Woodlands. I am going to make them myself on TV someday.” She said all this without pausing for breath.


  “The way you talk, I think you are going to be a lawyer someday. And maybe a politician. I am sure you will be on TV. What do you think of the banyan tree?”


  “It is like a forest,” she said. I thought that was a pretty astute remark for a 11-year-old.


  “Did you know it was here when Columbus discovered America? A ghost lives in it. It likes to gobble up little girls.” The Columbus part wasn’t quite true, but I figured I could get away with it.


  “Columbus discovered America in 1492. That sign says this tree is 400 years old. And we don’t believe in ghosts.”


  I was not doing very well against this 11-year-old girl. I was tempted to tell her my JEE rank, this usually worked with older people. But better sense prevailed. I sat back and smiled, wondering if all American kids were this way. The stone bench was nice and cool and the shade from the banyan tree was a relief from the heat. I watched them for a few minutes, carefree and energetic. At 17, maybe I was already feeling old.


  Presently, the older members of their party were ready to leave. The two girls ran after them, the older one trailing her sister.


  I got back on my bike myself, thinking I should get back to campus before it was dark. Also, I was getting hungry and the hostel mess would be opening for dinner soon.


  “Wait, you didn’t tell me your names,” I called after them.


  “My sister’s name is Maya.”


  “And yours?”


  “Kamala”, she said. “My name is Kamala.”

WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump on Wednesday tried to salvage a few priority items lost in the rubble of COVID-19 relief talks that he himself blew up, pressing for $1,200 stimulus checks and new aid for airlines and other businesses hard hit by the pandemic. But it's not clear whether he can undo the self-inflicted political damage so close to the election.
 In a barrage of tweets, Trump pressed for passage of these chunks of assistance, an about-face from his abrupt and puzzling move on Tuesday afternoon to abandon talks with a longtime rival, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. The California Democrat has rejected such piecemeal entreaties all along.
 Trump's tweets amounted to him demanding his way in negotiations that he himself had ended. Trump, who absorbed much political heat for abandoning the talks, is the steward of an economy whose continued recovery may hinge on significant new steps such as pandemic unemployment benefits. His tweets seemed to move the financial markets into positive territory, though it was far from certain whether they would impress voters demanding more relief.

Total nonfarm payroll employment expanded strongly in July and August, al­though payrolls had retraced only about half of the jobs lost at the onset of the pandemic. The unemployment rate moved down further to 8.4 percent in August. The unemployment rates for African Americans, Asians, and Hispanics declined over the past two months but remained well above the national average. The labor force participation rate rose, on net, and the employment- to-population ratio increased further in July and August. Initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits continued to move down, on net, through early September, but the pace of declines had slowed. In addition, weekly estimates of private-sector payrolls constructed by the Board's staff using data provided by the payroll processor ADP suggested that employment gains likely were still solid from mid-August to early September.

There are moments throughout history that cause a shift in course.


  In a year already marked by significant changes due to the COVID-19 pandemic, May 25, 2020, is among them.


  It’s the day when a 46-year-old African American man named George Floyd was killed at the hands of four Minneapolis police officers, pinned down by one who knelt upon Floyd’s neck for an excruciating eight minutes and 46 seconds.


  Stunned bystanders watched the scene unfold, with captured video of the event going viral.


  It signaled an immediate outcry, sparking protests throughout the world and conversations that had been overdue regarding systemic racism, police brutality and perception of the Black experience in America.


  For three Dubuque women, it further inspired a call to action through education, awareness and in providing a platform for those marginalized to give voice and value to their story.


  It was something Floyd never got the opportunity to do, as he cried out, “I can’t breathe,” and pleaded for his mother in his final moments.


  “Watching his last words is what did it for me,” said Gwendolyn Fountain. “He was calling for his mom. That was so overwhelmingly heartbreaking. For me, that was worth getting involved.”


  Fountain, along with Dereka Williams and Monique McCauley who call themselves the Queens for Peace, established the Switching Places Foundation in early June in Dubuque. Its mission is focused on bringing awareness to racial issues within the community, all the while promoting peace.


  In its infancy, the organization has organized four peaceful protests, as well as a Community United event at Dubuque’s Comiskey Park, bringing together a multiracial group of community members in celebration and solidarity.


  The Queens serve as mentors through their relationships with community members and are in the early stages of developing a program intended to inspire young Black women and children in the community, supporting them in becoming leaders and entrepreneurs.


  “We were motivated by passion,” Williams said. “We attended a protest and became inspired. We knew that as Black women, it was our duty to stand up and be a voice for our community. We were with the rest of the world to demand justice for our people.”


  Williams, 39, moved to Dubuque in 1995 with her sister and mother, who was hoping to provide a better life for her daughters. But, Williams said, that proved to be a struggle in a community immersed in racial tension.


  “It was really hard for me,” she said. “I knew that racism existed, but to experience from my teachers and peers in the 1990s what my mother experienced from her teachers and peers in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s was weird.”


  Williams eventually found herself at Dubuque’s now defunct Central Alternative High School, where she met Fountain, who shared a similar experience, and where both said they thrived.


  “It showed me that there are teachers who really care,” Williams said. “They showed me that it’s always worth the discussion to try to understand another person. I don’t think I would be where I am today without that.”


  Williams went on to earn her Bachelor of Arts in business management from the University of Dubuque. Until helping establish the Switching Places Foundation, she spent approximately five years mentoring children through other local organizations. Now, she’s setting out to do that on her own.


  “I’m very passionate about helping people, especially Black children,” she said. “I became a mother young in life. I have four children — a daughter, who is 22 and who graduated from Iowa State University and now works for the Department of Human Services in Des Moines. She was my blessing and helped me get through high school. I also have three sons — 17, 10 and 5. So this cause is important to me. My babies are my reasons. I don’t want them to live in fear of the people who are supposed to protect them. I want them to know that they can do whatever they want to do without the color of their skin holding them back.”


  Fountain, 42, moved to Dubuque in 1994 and, along with her investment in the newly established foundation, continues to work as paraprofessional. She got her start with Hillcrest Family Services before joining the Cornerstone Academy through the Dubuque Community School District.


  Much of her enthusiasm for the Switching Places Foundation also was born in her love of working with youth.


  “I always adored working with kids,” said Fountain, who has three children — daughters, ages 18 and 23; and a son, age 16. “A lot of what kids are still going through today are things that I went through. So when it comes to getting to the bottom of trying to settle differences and understand why a child might be acting out, I have a lot I can bring to trying to decipher what’s going on.”


  McCauley, 40, moved to Dubuque in 2002. While she doesn’t have children, she shares the same motivation in working with them as Williams and Fountain. She also has started a business, creating activities for kids.


  “I was raised to love everybody,” she said of her childhood upbringing. “So that’s the thing for me, helping children today have that same sense of love instilled in them.”


  Though longtime friends, the three said that life caused them to lose touch in recent years. The events surrounding the death of Floyd, and attending the same local protests that resulted, reunited them.


  “I feel like we found ourselves in a moment that was supposed to happen,” Williams said. “George Floyd awakened people. And the three of us were here to fight, to say no more and to standing on the side of good. It was destiny.”


  Through their educational efforts in the community, they’ve been able to foster other relationships, too. The women said others also are standing up in solidarity, building bridges and creating an empowering sense of community with a new willingness to speak up, to listen and to understand.


  “People who are White are speaking up, too,” McCauley said. “We’ve met people who attended our protests even though their families felt differently and didn’t want them to. That’s powerful.”


  It also has broken ground to three engaging in positive and progressive dialogue with not only community residents but leaders, emphasizing that while all lives indeed matter, it’s the value of the Black lives that has, over time, been threatened and needs to be addressed.


  “When it comes to racism, it’s not always the fault of the person who thinks that way,” Williams said. “Racism is something that is received. It’s about a lack of knowledge and fear. And it comes from a place of how people were taught. That’s why an organization like this is so important. It creates a place for people to understand what the Black community goes through from firsthand experience. And it gives a voice to the unheard.”


  The trio said they are humbled by being recognized as Women of the Year for their efforts, as well as seeing measures taking place within in the community.


  Among them are the creation of the “Solidarity” mural at Five Flags Center, for which they each had a hand in helping to paint, as well as Loras College’s decision to remove the statue of its founder after he was revealed to be a slave owner.


  “The support of the community and everyone standing by us has been really amazing to see,” Fountain said. “I feel like this is a really big step in a positive direction.”

I was paging through old photographs at my mom and dad’s earlier this fall, looking for a 1980s picture of my dad, his friend, Robert, and myself after a pheasant hunt in LaMoure County.


  We each held and proudly displayed one trophy rooster. It was from 1983, when you had 24 or so pictures on a roll of film and the investment was even more for buying and developing the precious film.


  Honestly, three decades later, the photograph is priceless.


  It represents the value of a hunt with friends, and the level of success was measured in a few birds and not “bagging a three-man limit” before lunch. Don’t get me wrong, the expansion of Conservation Reserve Program acres and the addition of other wildlife and habitat across the landscape since the 1980s has been a boon for pheasants and hunters alike.

Chennai Super Kings head coach Stephen Fleming said Kedar Jadhav was sent ahead of Ravindra Jadega and Dwayne Bravo in a tense run chase against Kolkata Knight Riders because of his ability to play spin well.


  However, Jadhav laboured to seven off 12 balls as KKR won the game by 10 runs here on Wednesday.


  “At the time, we thought that Kedar could play the spinner well and dominate, while Jadeja was there to come and finish. But in the end there was too much work to do and we fell short,” Fleming said at the press-match conference.


  Jadhav was trolled heavily on social media following the defeat.


  The New Zealander rued that their batsmen let it “slip” despite having so much resources. The team added just 14 runs from 11-14 overs, a period when they lost both Shane Watson and an in-form Ambati Rayudu.


  “If we could have got one of those players to 75-plus and continued that partnership for another maybe four or five overs, the game might have been a lot different.


  “Kolkata hung in there long enough to put pressure on us and we just couldn’t accelerate. We feel disappointed that we let it slip.”


  The absence of Suresh Raina, who pulled out of IPL for personal reasons, was once again felt sorely in the middle but Fleming said they have a well- balanced side.


  “But the performances like today, with the experience we have got, we should have put it away.”


  “We have got a lot of batsmen anyway so the balance is very good with the six bowlers. I don’t think an extra batsman is going to help.”


  Dinesh Karthik’s ploy to hold his ace spinner Sunil Narine for the back-end of the innings paid dividends as he dismissed his ‘bunny’ Watson for ninth time in T20s.


  “Ideally, you have one or two players bat through...Today with (Sunil) Narine holding overs back, it made it very difficult in the back-end,” the former Kiwi skipper said.


  Fleming further said they have plenty of batting resources and on the day their ploy did not work out.


  “We’ve got so much batting resources. Kedar is a late middle to late batter for India. We could have gone a whole lot of different ways. Today Kedar had some balls but that didn’t work out.


  “You always put players in different areas and that’s just when you have so much batting talent to choose from. It’s one of the things we look at, but it’s all in hindsight.”


  CSK bowlers on the other hand stood up to stage a remarkable comeback in the back to bowl out KKR for 167.


  In his first game of the season, legspinner Karn Sharma, who replaced Piyush Chawla in the XI, was the most economical of the lot and got CSK back into the game with his figures of 2/25 from his full quota.


  “He’s been waiting for a while for an opportunity. In the first over he was a bit unlucky but the next three overs he really worked hard and he got us back into the game. I think he can get some confidence from this.


  “With the pitches drying out, we can use him in combination with Piyush and Jaddu. We might be able to operate with more spinners which we are used to,” Fleming said.


  Medium pacers Sam Curran and Shradul Thakur also bagged two wickets, while left-arm spinner Ravindra Jadeja was not given the ball on a slow pitch.


  “It’s a question more for MS (Dhoni). I don’t make those decisions. I would imagine that it was a little bit to do with the wind and also the matchups that were out there with the left-handers. I think the general feel was that the medium pacers were doing a good job,” Fleming signed off.

In particular, these participants preferred forward guidance in which the target range for the federal funds rate remained at the ELB until inflation had moved above 2 percent for some time. Especially in light of the lengthy period in which inflation has run below the Committee's longer-run 2 percent objective, these participants judged that it was critical to demonstrate the Committee's commitment to achieve outcomes in which inflation averages 2 percent over time.

Members considered the staff proposal to eliminate the requirement in the directive to increase the holdings of agency CMBS in the SOMA portfolio. In light of the substantial improvement in market functioning in the agency CMBS market, the Committee judged that it would be appropriate for the Desk to purchase agency CMBS only as needed to sustain smooth market functioning, rather than seek to steadily increase agency CMBS holdings, and to cease reinvestments of agency CMBS principal payments. Members also concluded that, in light of ongoing low take-up at Desk repo operations, it was not necessary to include a sentence on these operations in the FOMC statement. However, the directive adopted by the Committee continued to direct the Desk to conduct overnight and term repo operations to support effective policy implementation and smooth functioning of short-term U.S. dollar funding markets.

It was a scrap but we get to tomorrow and that's all we can ask for." In the National League, Atlanta's Dansby Swanson and Travis d'Arnaud hit home runs to give the Braves a 2-0 victory over Miami and put them on the brink of advancing to the MLB's final four.


  The Braves, who haven't won the World Series since 1995, could complete a three-game sweep Thursday.


  The Atlanta-Miami winner will face either the Padres or Dodgers in the National League Championship Series.


  While the Braves used overpowering pitching, the A's won a slugfest with some relief help from Down Under.


  Pinder blasted a three-run homer in the top of the seventh inning to lift the A's level at 7-7, the club matching a 31-year-old team record with five homers in a playoff game.


  "That was awesome," Pinder said. "We came in there at 7-4. We had to come back. I was just looking for a good pitch and trying to put a good swing on it." Pinder and Sean Murphy each hit a run-scoring sacrifice fly to right field in the eighth inning to give Oakland their final victory margin.


  Closing relief ace Hendriks entered for Oakland in the seventh, the 31-year- old from Perth being asked to obtain the final nine outs -- triple his usual load -- to keep the A's season going.


  In the ninth, Hendriks retired the top of the Astros' batting order 1-2-3 to complete the victory.


  "He did a fantastic job. Time and time again, he has come through for us," Pinder said of Hendriks.


  Tommy La Stella, Mark Canha and Matt Olson hit solo homers early for the A's while Houston's Jose Altuve homered early as well.


  Marcus Semien smashed a solo homer in the fifth inning to give Oakland a 4-2 edge, but the Astros plated five runs in the bottom of the fifth, with Aledmys Diaz's two-run homer pulling the Astros level at 4-4.


  George Springer was hit by a pitch, took second on an Altuve single and scored on Michael Brantley's single to give Houston the lead. Alex Bregman doubled to drive in Brantley and scored himself on Kyle Tucker's single for a 7-4 Astros' adventage.

Investing in public relations is the best form of advertising, as for one, its permanent. Rather than spend $200 on advertising that will run out on a week, spending $200 on a published article to a leading news site will yield results long term, as it remains permanently, meaning increased chances of more eyeballs seeing it over time.

Democratic Senator Kamala Harris cemented her place in US history on Wednesday as the first woman of colour and the first Indian-American person to participate in a vice-presidential debate.


  Republican vice-president Mike Pence, the incumbent Harris is seeking to unseat, sought to live up to the expectations of defending President Donald Trump and his administration's handling of the Covid-19 pandemic that has killed more than 211,000 Americans.


  Despite tensions between the two camps, both Harris and Pence debated relatively more calmly compared to last month's acrimonious opening debate between Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and President Donald Trump that had devolved into name-calling.


  As a stark reminder of the times we are living in, Harris and Pence were separated by plexiglass barriers in an auditorium where guests had to wear face coverings, at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City.


   


   


  Social distancing norms were enforced far more rigorously than in the opening presidential debate, at which Trump's guests, including his family members, hadn't worn face coverings.


  "The American people have witnessed what is the greatest failure of any presidential administration in the history of our country," Harris said, landing the first punch of the night, referring to the Trump administration's handling of the pandemic.


  "I want the American people to know that from the very first day, President Donald Trump has put the health of America first," said Pence, defending the American president and himself as head of the White House task force, appointed by Trump, to lead the fight against the worst public health crisis in over a century.


  With at least 211,000 dead and over 7.5 million infected with the coronavirus in the US, and Trump, the first lady and a growing number of people in their circle testing positive for Covid-19, the pandemic was the top issue at the vice-presidential debate.


  Harris and Pence also clashed over climate change, trade war with China, economy, racism, healthcare, Supreme Court, women's right to abortion, and religion.


  As the running mate of Biden who was leading in national polls, Harris was expected to play it safe and not hand the Trump campaign a lifeline. And she did just that, overlooking several opportunities to attack Pence, much to the disappointment of many supporters who had expected to see flashes of her prosecutorial skills.


  "The debate was civil and constructive as compared to the presidential debate," said M R Rangaswami, founder of Indiaspora, a leading Indian-American advocacy group. "Kamala and Pence delivered their positions passionately and we now have 27 days to decide."


  Puneet Ahluwalia, a Republican running for Lt Governor in Virginia, a state that used to be Republican but has widely come to be considered Democratic lately, said, "VP Pence clearly distinguished himself by highlighting the exemplary job done for the American people by President Trump and his administration."

MARSHFIELD - The 2019 Marshfield High girls soccer team made a decent run to get into the postseason, only to be ousted after a tight competitive, game, 2-0 by Bishop Feehan. The Rams' disappointment at that loss was assuaged a bit when the Shamrocks (23-0-1) went on to win the Division 1 state championship.


  But there won't be much chance of building off the pride of a close battle with the state champs, because the bulk of that 2019 team's core graduated. How much soccer talent that 2019 class contained might be seen by noting that players from that group now play for the University of Rhode Island, University of Massachusetts, Bryant University, and Salve Regina.


  It's not like the cupboard is bare but the 2020 Rams will have a few veterans, and many more players either joining varsity for the first time, or seeing their first substantial minutes at the top level. Coach Dominic Centorino welcomed a stunning 71 candidates to the opening of practice this fall, so the varsity, JVs and freshman teams will all be fully stocked. And the Patriot League 'bubble' schedule is a bit unusual, in a good way for a young team, as five of the Rams' first six games are at home. They started the season Friday with a 6-0 loss to Hingham.


  "We lost a really strong senior core to graduation," said Centorino. "I would say at least three of them were just stellar athletes, the kind that are very hard to replace. This year's team is going to have to have a whole new identity of its own. We have some carryover, in returning players, but the new rules and everything make it all initially a bit overwhelming. I think our starting later this year has all the girls itching to get out there and play soccer, but it also leaves us a little behind on team bonding. Ultimately this season will be about the girls having fun, and bonding with their teammates, and we're just hoping to emphasize that, while playing good, competitive soccer."


  Marshfield has a couple of veteran captains in seniors Sam McGregor and Julie Alcaro, and the latter has a real desire to get back into action. Alcaro tore up her knee and missed all of her junior season.


  "They are a good pair of players to build around, and they are helping the other girls learn what it takes," said Centorino. "We kept as many players as we could this fall, so we have 29 players on our varsity team, and it is very senior-heavy, with 15 seniors. So I think that class will play a big role here, and Sam and Julie are excellent leaders."


  A couple of other veterans will play major roles for the new-look Rams, in juniors Riley Drosopoulos, a defender, and Bridgette Barrowman, an offensive- minded midfielder.


  "Riley is an outstanding back and we're lucky to have her," said Centorino, "while Bridgette is a junior who's basically been a starter since her freshman year. Those are two really important cogs for us."


  Marshfield High's reboot had to begin in net, where the 2019 team had standout netminder Kate McNeill.


  "We'll have senior Stella Scholfield and sophomore Sydney Sheehan playing goalkeeper for us," said Centorino. "They have both looked good so far. We also have a freshman goalie playing on the JVs - it's always good to have a couple goalies in the system, and after graduating Kate we had to replenish that position."


  Some other key performers come from all the classes.


  "We're looking for a big season from senior Laney Zaslaw, who scored a hat trick against Cohasset last year," noted Centorino. "And Laney has her kid sister, sophomore Sammy Zaslaw, a midfielder also on the team. We have two sets of sisters, with Sam McGregor's sophomore sister Maddie, a defender and midfielder, joining us, so that's always a good thing."


  "Mya D'Antonio is another young player with lots of potential, a sophomore forward who came up as a freshman last year," said Centorino. "And then we have junior Nadia Kiziuk, a very skilled midfielder. Sydney McCabe is another fine midfielder player, a junior, as is forward Sara Weijkus, and they've done well."


  "A couple of seniors we're looking to are forward Celine LeDoux and midfielder Gwyn O'Sullivan, and they are certainly in the mix too," said Centorino.


  When you get to the more specific roles, it isn't quite as clear who might emerge as the Rams scoring threats.


  "Last year we shared the wealth, and no one person scored a lot of goals," said Centorino. "I suspect it may be that way again. We have a lot of forwards this year, and we'll try and rotate them all in. One thing that helps there is the quarters format, instead of just playing halves like we did before. Four periods will help break it up and help us manage everyone's minutes better."


  The new pandemic MIAA rules changes are also likely to boost offense. There are no throw-ins but rather kick-ins, no heading the ball, no slide tackles, and minimal shoulder to shoulder contact allowed. Most observers would suggest it will make playing defense even more difficult.


  "We are expecting there will be penalties and a lot of indirect kicks for contact fouls," said Centorino. "And with teams unable to form defensive walls, those set plays become even more important. I think we are expecting a big season from Julie Alcaro, who has been itching to play for over a year, and did a lot of work to recover from her knee injury. We also expect to get some scoring from Bridgette Barrowman out of the midfield, as well as Laney Zaslaw, and Syndey McCabe."


  The Rams have studied the new rules and played two pre-season scrimmages, with referees to help them adjust.


  "Initially we all had some officials do a Zoom meeting to explain the new rules, and how they would be interpreted," Centorino explained. "My first impression was that this could be a high-scoring season for everyone, and from what we've seen it will be, but not absurdly so. I also believe the boys game is much more physical and faster than our game, so it may not be as big an adjustment for us. The silver lining, for us coaches, is that the key to playing with this new rulebook is stressing possession. We have to be more deliberate and patient with how we progress the ball down the field. And those direct free kicks with no wall will be big plays."


  "Our defenders have had two scrimmages with game officials to help us adjust," Centorino added. "The officials we had took the time to explain the calls they made, and those scrimmages - against Pembroke and Silver Lake - really helped us. If you kick the ball in the air, for example, it's a re- start. We have to play within the confines of the new rules, and find a way to be successful. But none of us wants a whistle every two minutes, or to ruin the flow of the game. We are hoping for consistency in enforcing the rules, and we know the officials' job is hard. But the main goal, is for everyone involved to have some fun playing soccer, and hopefully developing their skills, while enjoying all the social and emotional benefits of being part of a team"


  After the Rams' opening game, the state lifted restrictions on crowd sizes, so they anticipate being able to have up to 250 fans for each remaining home game. All the players and coaches were anxious to get going, and they have had to basically shrug off any misgivings about getting a late start and a compressed season. But once again, Marshfield becoming a full-fledged member of the Patriot League this fall has eased the way, and provided a competitive 11-game season.


  "There was a time we didn't know if this season would happen," Centorino admitted. "Finally they gave us a date and a structure, and we got to work. We do miss having more pre-season time, but we have 11 girls who play year-round, which helps. Every other team is in the same boat as far as limited practice, and I think we miss the opportunity for team bonding most of all. I have to give Bill Battis, our athletic director, a lot of thanks for all he's done, because he's been awesome, and brings so much credibility to our program. Our tryouts went well, the team looks good so far, and everyone is in agreement - it's great to be back."
