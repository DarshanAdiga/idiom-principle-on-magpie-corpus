The actor added he was instantly sold on Rai's vision of making the film's appeal wider by making it a funny movie. "I was sold with Aanand L Rai sir and Hitesh's vision because they wanted to make it a quintessential Bollywood movie and not approach this as a cause film. It's not an in depth look into the issue of same-sex relationships in our country," he added. Khuranna says the film, through the story of one family. "It should be viewed as a film that deals with the issues of one family and how they come to terms with their son being gay."

CARVER - Monday's 4-1 victory over Dennis-Yarmouth delivered Wareham/Carver hockey's third trip to the tournament in Coach Rich Valatkevicz's five-year tenure. The 10-6-1 Vikings have three regular season games left to sharpen their step heading into postseason play.
 "It's been great to have the chance to get back there again. It's been a great run. It was a team effort and it feels great to get back there again this year," Valatkevicz said coming off the Dennis-Yarmouth win.
 A big moment came earlier in the week for junior Tyler Lovendale, who scored his 100th career point in the Vikings' 7-6 loss to Somerset Berkley. He became the third player in Carver school history to do so, and Valatkevicz recognized how he has impacted the program.
 "He's been absolutely huge for the program. He's a great kid. The last three years I've given him the sportsmanship award. He's a quiet kid and he doesn't say a lot, but he goes out and does his job every night, (he) never complains. He'll do whatever I ask him to do. If I asked him to go down to the second line, he's like 'whatever it takes, coach, to win a hockey game'. That's the type of player you want. Very coachable, no question about it."
 As the tournament approaches, the Vikings have won four of their last five games, and it has been due to stifling play on the defensive side of the puck, both by the defensemen and senior goaltender Alex DeMarco. In their last three victories, they have given up three total goals, one per contest, showing off their defensive prowess in the latter half of the regular season.
 "It's probably (been) a combination (of defensemen and DeMarco). Alex has had some great games again this year, some shaky starts. I think the team overall has had some shaky starts, but we turn it on through the second and third. I think recently, finally, like I told them, put 45 minutes in. Not 15, not 30, but just go out and play hard and I think we have in the past three or four games or so. Again, it's good timing as the season is coming closer to an end and we need this run to play as hard as we can," he said.
 The team had a bit of an up and down start to the season, hanging around the .500 mark at the beginning and turning it up as the season dwindles to its end at this point of the year, but overall, it's been nothing short of yet another successful season for the team as a whole, but the job isn't done.
 Wareham/Carver finds itself in the midst of a battle in the South Coast League standings with teams like Apponequet and Seekonk as Somerset Berkley looks overhead, perched at a league best 14-3. Seekonk, Apponoquet, and Wareham/Carver are all within a game of each other in the standings, but the Vikings have done their part to put up a fight, even if the head-to-head record doesn't indicate it. The Vikings are 1-5 against those three teams this season, but it's been close on the scoreboard. The team has been one goal short against each of those squads this season, suffering a 5-4 loss to Seekonk early in the year, a 4-3 loss to Apponequet, and most recently, a 7-6 loss to Somerset Berkley earlier this week. A couple of bad breaks, and slow starts as Valatkevicz mentioned, could've flipped those one goal losses in the other direction.
 Although the team is making its way to the tournament once again, some pressure is surely applied based off the group out there on the ice. Many of the top players will leave the team at season's end, so capitalizing on the opportunity at hand is vital for the players and coaching staff. Making the most of veteran pieces will be the key to moving on throughout each round. DeMarco, along with one of the team's high-volume scorers Quirino doCanto, and a key member of the team's trusted defensive lines, Brian Gallagher, are all seniors and will graduate this spring, making this playoff run even more important to cap off their careers on a high note.
 "Absolutely (there is some pressure), losing Q, Alex, and Gallagher, on defense, they're three key players that definitely make an impact on the team. All three of them are huge parts to the team. It's going to be hard to replace all three. When one of your top scorers (is) going, your top goaltender, and top defensemen, they will be hard to replace. I'm just hoping these kids, the ones coming up, (will) be able to step into a good role in the next year or so. I lose them, but I'll have some good players. I should be able to have some good lines, I think goaltending will be the question."
 To close out the regular season, the Vikings square off against the league's surprise team, Bourne, followed by a two-game homestand against Monomoy and Upper Cape Tech. Valatkevicz commented on what it's going to take to finish off the regular season on top.
 "An overall team effort, that's the biggest thing. I think they need to come together as a team. They need to realize what they're going to face. I think, the way I'm looking at it, Bourne, for the first time, they're in the heart of the tournament for the first time in years, but they're going to give us a hard time. They're going to want to beat us, they're going to come after us."

During the popular revolution that deposed Bashir in 2019, The ICC renewed his indictment on charges of human rights atrocities in Darfur, but the Sudan's military, which shares the current transitional government with Forces of Freedom and Change and was still wielding a measure of power at the time, said it won't extradite him to face war crimes charges, a position that made people sceptical about change and the new system. With the new announcement, however, his fate may not be any more certain now than it was in 2019. However, it has certainly renewed a debate among Sudanese people on that big African question of whether the ICC is a good route to justice for Africans, whether there is any justice in sending men like Bashir to far-away courts, where they live in comfort for prolonged periods, being tried in courts surrounded by heavy security, where their victims will not be able to confront them and where they might die, as Serbia and Yugoslavia's Slobodan Milošević did, before any justice is exacted from them.

You have called your performance this quarter a temporary blip. Do we expect these expenditures to normalise soon? How long is temporary?There is a temporary dip in PAT and that is because of the investment we have made in sales, marketing, in people and technology. We have senior people on board. This the only way for us to drive sustainable growth in the future. Also, in terms of volumes, revenue has grown by 7% both in Q3 and for nine months. Our expectation was much higher. If we had volume growth in the mid teens, all of these expenses would have been fully absorbed and we would have been able to achieve the margins. At present, we are in a sluggish phase as far as demand is concerned. Whenever demand returns, we will be back to the margins that we have been delivering. When do you expect the situation to normalise? Would it be fair to expect margins bouncing back to previous levels of 20% plus anytime soon? The margins would bounce back but then the growth has to come in the demand so definitely we are looking at FY21 with much more planning and optimism than we have it now. Does demand continue to be as weak in Q4? What is the sense you are getting from the grass roots? Is the worst over?We do not approach the market only from the margin perspective. Our strategy has always been to invest for the future growth. We have an extremely strong balance sheet and we are debt free and are able to invest to create that growth. The market demand being whatever, the macro situation will affect everyone. But we are in an under penetrated premium apparel market and there is multiple opportunity for us to grow. We have been expanding the presence and distribution in exclusive business outlets and we are continuing to invest in technology. The Street is expecting the industry to grow by 10% in FY21. Do you concur with that? How do you see Page Industries growing vis-à-vis the industry?A double digit growth is something we always plan for. That is the way we prepare both the backend and the frontend of the organisation, in terms of channel and the solution. So yes the FY21 should be better than FY20. But I am not too sure whether it will be 10% growth for everyone. We have to wait and watch in Q4 as to how the demand pattern turns. Competition is also getting aggressive. The Birlas are pushing the Van Heusen brand and then there are the likes of H&M; etc. How are you protecting your market share?We do not look at it as a market share. It is an underpenetrated premium apparel market. We look at the penetration levels. The penetration into the premium market is of the order of 20% in premium men innerwear. We have a penetration of close to 6% to 8% in the women’s market as well as in the Athleisure which is the active wear segment. So the market is there, competition has been there, we have been in business for the past 25 years in India. We have faced competition only in the past two decades. Some have disappeared, some people have stayed. Our approach has always been to grow the market. We respect all the competition and we learn from them, but it is not an impediment as far as our plans to grow. Recently questions have been raised over the two pillars of Page’s peak narrative that the company is economy proof and competition proof. Is the concern justified?Page is also an example because we had almost double digit volume and revenue growth in the past. We have been subject to the demand and consumption story being sluggish but the differentiation as far as Page is concerned is that we have a strong balance sheet and a very large consumer base. We reach out to more than 63,000 retail outlets and we are able to withstand the slow phase. That is the reason we are able to invest. We have confidence and optimism that the market will return with respect to growth and we will succeed. We can say that we are our own competition. What we mean is that having been around for 25 years, we are able to improve on our value for money proposition in the premium quality apparel space. And because this market is underpenetrated, we are best placed to take advantage of that. You are expanding your channel presence in exclusive business outlets. Does it mean you would be reducing focus in small outlets? What is the difference in returns from EBOs versus small multi brand stores?In terms of the constant growth across channels, each channel is treated separately. We have 720 exclusive business outlets. They call as EBOs and we have a target of reaching the EBOs to a 1,000 plus, which will possibly happen in FY21. MBOs are also growing. We have to reach out to the consumer base and we are continuing to do that. We are present in large format stores as well as on e-commerce. All these channels are continuing to grow. What about your plans to enhance distribution? Is this going to be the new pillar of growth?We serve 63,000 retail outlets and these are serviced by about 4,300 plus distributor accounts. So, distribution is growing all the time. Speedo has not picked up in India as yet. When do you see it contributing meaningfully to Page Industries? What are your plans to expand beyond the Jockey brand?Swimming is a sports activity and it is still at a nascent stage in terms of widespread acceptance by the entire population. Also the access to swimming is not available to everyone. But Speedo International, whom we represent, has done a market study; India is the fastest growing swimming market and therefore we are present in 1,300 plus retail outlets and about 44 EBOs and we are taking all the steps to improve the market reach. Of course, Speedo is a niche market and it cannot be as big as Jockey, but it has its own place and this is also the first few years of operating in India. Page has been aggressively working on ramping up the kids clothing portfolio. You have set up an independent sales team for that. What is the acceptance like?The acceptance has been pretty good. We have grown almost 45% this year and we have also created a separate channel for kids. That means, right from the country level to the field, we have a 100-plus-strong sales force. We also appointed Jockey Junior’s specific channel partners in 50 cities and this is only the phase one. We are also planning to open exclusive Jockey Junior EBOs in the coming quarter.

“I remember coming out of the building, looking up, seeing the hole in the building,” she said. “Somebody said it was a plane.”
 Having no idea of the enormity of what was happening – the second plane hadn’t struck yet – she took a subway to Grand Central Station, where she used a pay phone to call her family. They were relieved to hear her voice.
 “I remember my dad saying, ‘I want you to get out of Manhattan, go to your apartment and stay there,’” she said.

 It took him hours to get through to the U.S. but eventually he talked to her parents. They told him Sara was OK.
 “My mom told me that Ovi was really emotional talking to her, because he couldn’t reach me – I didn’t have a cellphone,” Sara said.

 “I knew she was the one, and after Sept. 11, I just thought it was a good time,” he said. “My golf guys always joke that I caught her in a weak state of mind.”
 “It just made you realize what was important in life,” Sara said.
 They decided to move to Pittsburgh, where she got a position singing at Calvary Episcopal Church in Shadyside.
 “The first day I had that church job, I ran up to the minister and said, ‘How soon could you marry me?’” Sara said. “I called my mom and said, ‘I’m getting married Saturday – Can you guys come?’”
 Ovi and Sara were married Dec. 8, 2001. A year later they had a more traditional wedding, which Ovi’s family was able to attend.
 Ovi had been living in the U.S. on a tourist visa, but when they were married, he received a work permit. After a year, he was able to apply for a green card, and in 2005, became an American citizen during a ceremony at the courthouse in downtown Pittsburgh.
 “It was really a beautiful, meaningful service,” Sara said. “I remember Ovi taking his vow of loyalty to the United States.”
 “It was really something, really special,” Ovi said.
 Her grandfather attended that ceremony and their wedding. The couple remained very close to him until his death in 2008.
 The couple now lives in North Strabane with their three children, Henry, 9, Alex, 6, and Charlotte, 1. Sara is president of her family’s business, Botkin Family Wealth Management, in Peters Township, and Ovi is a real estate agent for Howard Hanna.
 Now, the whole family enjoys Caribbean cruises.
 “Even now when we go on a cruise, the formal dinners are one of the highlights,” Ovi said. “The guys wear tuxedos and the ladies wear pretty dresses. It’s very fancy.”
 Next month they plan to take a trip to Italy, just the two of them. This year, they’ll celebrate their 19th wedding anniversary, and 20 years since that magical cruise. They have a 23-foot boat and named it “The Century,” after the cruise ship on which they met.
 “I’m just so proud of Ovi,” Sara said. “He came to a totally new country and is such a beloved member of my family. He’s the best dad, the best husband. My dad always says I hit the jackpot.”

At Good Shepherd Lutheran Church, we receive two offerings at every service. The first offering is for the day-to-day ministry of our faith community. With the support of the faithful, this offering keeps the lights on, the heat running, and the salaries paid. And while some of the first offering is given back into the Manistee community to various ministries provided for in our annual budget, the second offering received is given away. We receive it with metal buckets, sometimes referred to as our noisy offering, it is also known in our parish as the "Team Jesus" offering. The congregation enjoys the levity of making as much noise as possible, although some also enjoy the giving of the 'silent' folded bills. In either case, we get the job done.

The Stonegate Pub Company , which operates The Fatling in Hornchurch High Street, submitted an application seeking planning permission for a new outdoor food unit and a fixed pergola on Monday, February 10. Havering Council's planning department is expected to make a decision on the submitted plans by April 6. Documents and drawings submitted alongside the application show that the company plans to completely upgrade the venue's outdoor offering in the space between the pub building and Nando's. The large umbrellas currently providing a covered area would be removed, under the proposals, and replaced with a new pergola with \"a clear, perspex-style roof\" that would cover slightly more of the outdoors area. The existing outdoor bar hut to the rear of the lot would remain, and a new outdoor food hut would be installed nearer the high street and backing onto the Nando's building. The plans also suggest the entire outdoor area would be lit by festoon lighting hanging from a new central post. No changes are set to be made to the interior of the pub, under the submitted plans. The Fatling, formerly known as the Bull, was a triple winner at the Havering Night Life Awards 2018 - where it scooped the best live venue, best customer care and best bar none prizes. A pub has stood on the site, in the centre of Hornchurch, since the 17th century. Any residents wishing to view the plans in more detail or comment on the application can visit havering.gov.uk\/planning. Residents can also email comments to planning@havering.gov.uk or write to Planning Control, Mercury House, Romford, RM1 3SL. All comments must be received by March 4.

DES MOINES -- Sen. Rich Taylor has learned over the years to filter out much of the loud chit chat that fills the Senate Chambers, but on Wednesday, he heard a voice he just couldn't shake.
 It was one of paranoia and suspicion.
 "Why are they talking to you? You don't know them. They're out to get you," the voice whispered.
 "In Senate Chambers, there are loud conversations going on all around me all the time, and pretty soon you learn to tune a lot of that out," the Mount Pleasant Democrat said. "Now the little girl who was in my ear here, I couldn't tune her out."
 That girl was Alyssa Dameron, a Burlington High School junior who traveled to Des Moines with 26 other students from 13 other area high schools participating in Southeastern Community College's MPower U Leadership program for Southeast Iowa Days, during which the student delegate lobbied local legislators for action on mental health, solar energy and sex ed.
 The whispering, done through a rolled up piece of paper, was an exercise to demonstrate what people with auditory hallucinations experience.
 "Imagine being in elementary school trying to learn a lesson and hearing things and looking around and seeing no one is talking to you," said Hunter Miller of West Burlington High School. "Imagine how hard it would be to focus."
 Taylor, Rep. Dennis Cohoon, D-Burlington, and Rep. Jeff Kurtz, D-Keokuk, as well as a room full of delegates from the southeast Iowa region, were presented with mental health statistics demonstrating just how pressing of an issue it has become.
 "One in six children aged 2 to 8 years have had a diagnosed mental, behavioral or developmental disorder in 2019," Dameron said. "This statistic does not account for the children that go undiagnosed year after year because of lack of education and resources."
 Johnson pointed to a 2020 study by the Iowa Department of Education that found one in five students in Iowa are affected by mental health issues during adolescence.
 Furthermore, Dameron stated, the Iowa Department of Corrections estimated about 33 percent of individuals incarcerated in Iowa have a serious mental illness, and another 24 percent have some other chronic mental health diagnosis.
 "Many of these illnesses start at a young age, so it's likely that if these people had the resources to recognize their illness at a young age, many of these individuals wouldn't have ended up engaging in criminal activity, which means crime rates and jail populations would decrease," Dameron said.
 The students acknowledged the $2.1 million in funding recently allocated to children's mental health, as well as a bill (Senate File 2113) passed in 2018 requiring teachers be trained in suicide prevention and postvention, but ...
 "Suicide is not the only problem," Johnson said. "It's just one among many disasters that results in mental illness."
 Alexandra Gerling was among the MPower U students who lobbied legislators for mandatory suicide prevention training prior to that legislation being passed. She was back at the capitol building Wednesday as a legislative ambassador with the University of Northern Iowa. She plans to be a full-time lobbyist for mental health after graduating.
 "It fascinates me how little people are educated (about mental health)," she said. "It's improved, but I don't think it will ever be enough."
 MPower U students this time around argued for mandatory training in Mental Health First Aid for all teachers and high school sophomores in the state of Iowa, school-based therapists at every school, mandatory mental health screenings much like hearing and vision screenings, and the use of Telehealth for follow up referrals.
 "In the past there has been trouble finding the resources to follow up with students and give them the proper referrals that they need. Previously, there has been no resources for students other than a counselor," Miller said. "Telehealth has changed this. Telehealth offers an online connection to resources for people who normally would not have access to a facility or professional therapist. Having this technology gives students the option to speak to a mental health professional online at a low cost."
 Once the students had completed their presentation, Taylor asked them if they knew how much funding was allotted to public schools to implement the suicide prevention training. They did not.
 "Not a dollar," Taylor said. "That's something that you guys can work on with us in the Legislature is if we're going to force your schools to do something, that takes something away from your education if we don't fund it."
 Johnson said they did not have a specific plan for how it would be funded, but she pointed to the Galesburg, Illinois, School District, which uses Title I funding and a voter-approved property tax to fund the Mental Health First Aid training at its schools, as well as to provide school-based therapists.
 Hope Haven Director Bob Bartles expressed his own frustration with mental health funding, or the lack thereof, and encouraged the students to continue advocating for mental health funding whilst meeting with legislators during a reception to follow that evening.
 "Last year, the Legislature cast a law requiring regional boards for counties to come together to fund mental health services for kids. That's a wonderful thing. The infrastructure's been put in place, but there is no funding," Bartles said. "The legislators decide amongst all the various ways to spend money, whether you're going to get it or not, whether mental health gets it or not, and they listen to you. You have powerful voices."
 Finding the Middle Ground: Sexual Education in Public Schools
 Another group MPower U students, each wearing a blue ribbon to represent teen pregnancy awareness, lobbied for a detailed set if standards to be covered in sexual education, that all students take a well-defined sexual education unit and that health professionals be involved in the delivery of that unit, and that health class be a required credit to graduate, with sexual education being a unit.
 Shelby Ryan of West Burlington High School argued that opting out of sex ed should not be an option.
 "We can all agree that students are responsible for educating students, and we can also agree that sex is going to be a natural thing that is going to one day occur in those kids' lives if it hasn't already," Ryan said. "Opting kids out of sexual education is opting them out of getting the experience to learn, understand and use factual information in a mix that will take place in their futures. Students cannot opt out of math, reading, or science, although we really want to, so why can they opt out of sexual education?"
 In preparing for the presentation, Ryan contacted education board for the state of New Jersey, which has the fifth lowest teen pregnancy rate in the U.S. and a well enforced sex ed curriculum. She learned that even if students in New Jersey do opt out of the school-offered sex ed unit, they still must complete alternative instruction based on state standards.
 Future Energy - Solar Energy
 Another group of about a dozen students, each sporting a pair of sunglasses on their shirts, lobbied for legislators to make solar energy more accessible for individuals.
 "We think most of you don't have solar energy because it costs so much," said Ethan Deacon of Fort Madison High School, arguing for an increase in tax credits.
 Deacon explained the average cost to set up solar panels is between $14,000 and $19,000. The federal tax credit for solar energy is 30 percent, while the state tax credit is 50 percent of the federal tax credit.
 "So if my parents wanted solar power, let's say they spent $19,000 and they got 15 percent back, they'd get $2,850 back," Deacon said. "They'd still have to pay $16,150."
 That is no small sum, especially when considering the average annual household income for Iowa residents is $58,570.
 Avery Maeder of Winfield-Mount Union requested an increase in the incentives budget for solar installation, as well as for those incentives to extend to non-profits including schools, churches and hospitals.
 "We know that there is $5 million allotted to solar energy incentives," Maeder said. "Those incentives get spent really quickly by for-profit businesses and industries."
 Maeder pointed to Great River Health System, which is in the process of installing a 30-acre solar field at its West Burlington location, an investment that will allow the hospital to save an estimated $433,000 a year in utility costs.
 "Because Great River Health System is a non-profit organization, they are not eligible for any tax incentives," Maeder said. "By putting non-profit organizations in the incentives fund, Iowa will become a greener state."
 Boone Messer of Keokuk High School spoke of the benefits of adding incentives for installation of batteries, which can cost between $5,000 and $8,000 by themselves, when installing solar panels.
 Batteries, Messer pointed out, release fewer emissions than do generators. It also is cheaper for homes when they don't have to use power from the grid.
 "Not a lot of people have them when they have their solar panels installed," Messer said. "Additional incentives would make that more common."

Weisz added that she approached the Saturday without the fear of failure and focused only on what she could control. That led to a score of 624.9.
 “The score was not at all what I would be hoping for at the second round of Olympic trails,” Weisz said. “It was not something that I would consider a good score for myself, but I was able to walk off the line and got talk to my coach and was like, ‘I did everything I could.’”
 Knowing that it was a close race based on the scores in December, Weisz improved on Sunday with a score of 625.3. Then, heading into the finals Sunday evening, she made an unusual decision.
 “I chose to avoid looking at the standings going into the finals. So I had no idea where I needed to finish, who was behind me, where they needed to finish compared to me to beat me, which in retrospect I couldn’t tell you if that was a good idea or bad idea,” said Weisz. “However it played out played out.”
 In the final round, which is used for additional points, Weisz placed sixth out of eight shooters. But the 1.5 points she scored was just enough to secure second place and a spot on the national roster.
 Weisz was eliminated in the finals by Georgia’s Sarah Beard in two shoot offs. Both shot a 10.4 in the first shoot off and then Beard won the second when she recorded a shot that was three-tenths deeper than Weisz.
 From that point Weisz became a spectator and hoped for the best.
 “I knew it was probably her or one other of my competitors that could have been pretty close to me in the point rank, but I wasn’t sure by how much,” said Weisz. “At that point all I could do is sit back and kind of embrace all of it, take it all in, watch my competitors finish out their final, and they were shooting well, and hope for the best.”
 Weisz had finished with a total score of 1256.0 in December and combined with her total in Part II of the trials, she edged Beard (2506.5) for second place.
 But, it wasn’t until Dan Durben, the national rifle coach approached her, that Weisz learned she had secured a spot on the Olympic team.
 “I think for a second I broke down a little bit. But I knew I still had to go congratulate my competitors and teammates, so I pulled it together before getting too emotional,” said Weisz. “But I just remember shaking his hand and literally all I could say was ‘no’. Like how, there’s no way just because I was pretty disappointed in my finals still.”
 The Olympic games begin July 24 and run through Aug. 9. Air rifle shooting will be contested July 25 (women) and July 26 (men).
  _Editor’s note: Weisz will have a short break before returning to competition March ... Weisz currently resides in Tennessee and serves as the graduate assistant coach for the rifle team at the University of Memphis ... Weisz trains and coaches during the day, while pursuing her masters degree at night._

Has the Republican Party completely surrendered to the outrageous behavior of Donald Trump? The "party of family values" remain silent while his actions continue to embarrass us at home and abroad. As he tells lie after lie and bullies anyone who challenges him by threats and name-calling, Republicans say nothing. Are they so afraid of losing their next election that they are willing to let Trump do whatever he wants? In fact, he claims that Article II of the Constitution gives him the power. Unbelievable! If he would read the Constitution, he would understand that we employ a system of checks and balances to safeguard against abuse of power by any one branch of government.
 I watched with complete shock while my congressman, Rep. Guy Reschenthaler, defended Trump's actions when he asked a foreign government (Ukraine) to investigate an American citizen in order to benefit him in the 2020 election. Sen. Pat Toomey, another Trump sycophant, voted against calling witnesses during the so-called impeachment trial. Has there ever been a trial without witnesses? How can Reschenthaler and Toomey, and the vast majority of Republican members of Congress continue to turn a blind eye to Trump's behavior?
 We, the American taxpayers, pay these people $174,000 a year to represent us and defend the Constitution, not to serve as lap dogs for an out-of-control president.

WENATCHEE — The City Council on Thursday voted to extend allowed operating hours for marijuana stores to 8 a.m. to midnight.
 Currently Wenatchee allows the stores to be open from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.
 The change puts the city on the same page as the state, which allows marijuana stores to operate from 8 a.m. to midnight. The city of Chelan also specifically allows those hours, and East Wenatchee doesn’t specify but complies with the state law.
 The reason for the discrepancy is unclear, but some councilmembers and city staff said it could have been that the state law was different when Wenatchee enacted the rule.

Martin Spellman M.D.
 Jan. 17, 1933 - Feb. 10, 2020
 Martin Adelbert Spellman, a radiologist, watercolor painter, Rotarian and world traveler, died February 10 in Fremont. Marty was born Jan. 17, 1933 to Martin Charles Spellman and Kathleen Carmelle Dolan in San Francisco. He grew up in the Sunset district and graduated from Lowell High School in 1950. He graduated from Stanford University in 1954 and Stanford Medical School in 1957. He worked as a radiologist at Washington Hospital in Fremont for over 30 years.      Marty met his future wife Sherril Steinman while working as a bartender at Sunnyside resort in Lake Tahoe, charming her while she was on a date with someone else. They married in 1956 and moved the next year to Bremerhaven, Germany, where Marty was an army captain and doctor for four years. In Germany, the two made an uncharacteristic splurge on a Porsche convertible, which took them on camping trips to Norway, an adventure in Gibraltar and everywhere in between. He drove that car for the rest of his life.   Life back in the U.S. in the 1960s was full of family and work and garden projects at the 1892 Victorian farmhouse the family settled in, which was the scene of volleyball parties and, later, a family wedding. His children remember sneaking the family's puppies into the hospital for Xrays after they swallowed sewing pins. Marty was known for being very fair and that set high expectations. One weekend morning, his children marched around the breakfast table with picket signs protesting the lawn mowing rate. Marty and Sherrill traveled the world with their family to adventurous destinations, visiting China, Russia and Nepal before tourism was common there. Marty took painting trips to France, Spain and Mexico. But he was expert at house painting, too, a skill each of his children appreciated.      Marty taught at Stanford Medical School in the 1980s and took trips to Ghana, Cuba, The Azores and Panama to help train local doctors. Marty was an active Rotarian in Fremont.      Marty always advised grabbing every opportunity for an adventure. His oft- repeated motto was "Live it up or give it up."      Longtime opera and ballet fans, Marty and Sherril were open to all kinds of entertainment, and once stumbled upon the Folsom Street Fair on the way to the opera and enjoyed a beer among the leather-clad celebrants. After retirement, he became a fixture in downtown Niles, attending Fremont Art Association painting classes, having breakfast at the Nile Cafe, visiting Joe's Corner, Niles ice cream shop and Federico's for crab cakes. He was a regular at the Olive Hyde art openings and attended a men's book group and an Irish book club in San Francisco.      Marty was predeceased by his wife Sherril Spellman. He is survived by brother Michael Spellman and his wife Berdell, his daughter Shannon Spellman and her husband Joel Cantor, his son Patrick Spellman and wife Wendy, and son Peter Spellman and his partner Anthony Spivey. He is also survived by his grandchildren Jake, Dylan, Elliot and Cooper Cantor and Bowen and Jack Spellman. A celebration of Marty's life is planned for August 1, 2020.

The U.S. Marshals Service said Headley was caught on Sunday Feb. 2 after being on the run for 21 months. He has been on the nation’s 15 Most Wanted List for the U.S. Marshals Service since November.
 For security reasons the U.S. Marshals Service have a longstanding tradition never to discuss specific prisoner transports or logistics. John Hall, chief deputy marshal for Vermont, said Tuesday the return of Headley is a priority, but gave no timetable.
 South Burlington Police Sgt. Chris Bataille, the lead investigator in the homicide, said he understands considerable paperwork, approvals and other steps need to be completed before Headley might arrive in Vermont.
 Once he is in Vermont, Headley will be formally arraigned on the murder charge.
 When Headley fled he had a sexual assault on a minor charge pending in court, records show.
 U.S. Marshals worked various investigative angles, to include exploring Headley’s ties to Jamaica, where he was born. Those ties were analyzed further by investigators in the U.S. Marshals Service Jamaica Foreign Field Office with the help of the Jamaica Constabulary Force, Jamaica Fugitive Apprehension Team.
 Investigators developed information that led them to believe Headley was in the Westmoreland Parish of Jamaica, specifically in the town of Negril.
 Jamaican authorities spotted Headley in Negril about 7 p.m., Sunday, Feb. 2, driving a vehicle that was previously identified during the course of the fugitive investigation.

 Martin Spellman M.D. Jan. 17, 1933 - Feb. 10, 2020 Martin Adelbert Spellman, a radiologist, watercolor painter, Rotarian and world traveler, died February 10 in Fremont. Marty was born Jan. 17, 1933 to Martin Charles Spellman and Kathleen Carmelle Dolan in San Francisco. He grew up in the Sunset district and graduated from Lowell High School in 1950. He graduated from Stanford University in 1954 and Stanford Medical School in 1957. He worked as a radiologist at Washington Hospital in Fremont for over 30 years. Marty met his future wife Sherril Steinman while working as a bartender at Sunnyside resort in Lake Tahoe, charming her while she was on a date with someone else. They married in 1956 and moved the next year to Bremerhaven, Germany, where Marty was an army captain and doctor for four years. In Germany, the two made an uncharacteristic splurge on a Porsche convertible, which took them on camping trips to Norway, an adventure in Gibraltar and everywhere in between. He drove that car for the rest of his life. Life back in the U.S. in the 1960s was full of family and work and garden projects at the 1892 Victorian farmhouse the family settled in, which was the scene of volleyball parties and, later, a family wedding. His children remember sneaking the family's puppies into the hospital for Xrays after they swallowed sewing pins. Marty was known for being very fair and that set high expectations. One weekend morning, his children marched around the breakfast table with picket signs protesting the lawn mowing rate. Marty and Sherrill traveled the world with their family to adventurous destinations, visiting China, Russia and Nepal before tourism was common there. Marty took painting trips to France, Spain and Mexico. But he was expert at house painting, too, a skill each of his children appreciated. Marty taught at Stanford Medical School in the 1980s and took trips to Ghana, Cuba, The Azores and Panama to help train local doctors. Marty was an active Rotarian in Fremont. Marty always advised grabbing every opportunity for an adventure. His oft-repeated motto was Live it up or give it up. Longtime opera and ballet fans, Marty and Sherril were open to all kinds of entertainment, and once stumbled upon the Folsom Street Fair on the way to the opera and enjoyed a beer among the leather-clad celebrants. After retirement, he became a fixture in downtown Niles, attending Fremont Art Association painting classes, having breakfast at the Nile Cafe, visiting Joe's Corner, Niles ice cream shop and Federico's for crab cakes. He was a regular at the Olive Hyde art openings and attended a men's book group and an Irish book club in San Francisco. Marty was predeceased by his wife Sherril Spellman. He is survived by brother Michael Spellman and his wife Berdell, his daughter Shannon Spellman and her husband Joel Cantor, his son Patrick Spellman and wife Wendy, and son Peter Spellman and his partner Anthony Spivey. He is also survived by his grandchildren Jake, Dylan, Elliot and Cooper Cantor and Bowen and Jack Spellman. A celebration of Marty's life is planned for August 1, 2020.

"I have no shame in my game when I'm scouting," Fultz said during a recent interview at Hotel Crosby in downtown Stillwater, which sometimes serves as her de facto office. "My daughter sprained her ankle, and I approached the ortho at Tria. He was married; he couldn't wear a ring. Mary absolutely was under the table. She was, like, 'Are you kidding me?'

Barr himself has been under fire for the reversal. Still, it was a highly unusual move for a member of the Cabinet to criticize the president — especially a Trump loyalist who shares the president's views on expansive executive powers. Thursday's comment served as a defense of his own integrity — an effort to salvage his own reputation and that of the Department of Justice by publicly rebuking the president he's propped up from Day One of his tenure.

Trump made the offhanded suggestion on Thursday as he railed against Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, a Ukraine specialist on the National Security Council who was one of several administration officials who listened in on the July call. Vindman, who was prematurely booted from his White House post last week, told impeachment investigators in the fall that Trump’s conduct during the call raised alarms and that he reported his concerns to a top White House lawyer.
