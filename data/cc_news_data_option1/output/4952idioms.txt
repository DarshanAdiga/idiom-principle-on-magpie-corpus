Hi Mike, I don’t believe Biden has ever been good not even on paper, and yes you are right, as soon as some of the 8 million candidates drop out, Biden’s lead will shrink. And it’ll shrink more because he won’t shut up and he has really bad instincts for everywhere in America that isn’t Delaware. Trump said one thing that is right, he does it every once in a while, Joe Biden was rescued from the dustbin of history by Pres. Obama.

But you can see the effects of the procedures we've put in place. I think the strategic decision to close the club facilities the last two days reflects that. We made that decision after a number of weeks of discussion based on the fact of potential additional risk of exposure during the holiday season last week. We're going to continue to monitor that. We'll obviously need to continue to evolve and to adjust based on what our data shows as we move forward, but we're seeing some very positive trends in the numbers."

 “Small businesses, for many, are the beating heart of our communities.
 “We must band together to make sure we save small firms and jobs from being lost.”
 London policy chair Rowena Howie added: “These have been trying and difficult times for so many, and with the festive season upon us, it’s never been more important to see trading resume.
 “Many small businesses will be issuing a sigh of relief that they can operate in Tier 2 in what is the busiest month of the year for many.”

Beyond providing adequate and accessible medical services and supplies, governments should consider means of reducing overcrowding and limiting transfers of detainees that might increase the risk of transmission of COVID-19 within the detainee population. State authorities might allow individuals in their custody or under their care to transition to reside in host communities where they might socially distance more effectively, within the bounds of official processes for determining status. Some States have already taken this approach: the Norwegian government has released some migrants from detention in light of the pandemic on a case-by-case basis, allowing selected individuals to seek accommodation with their contacts in the country so long as they regularly report to public authorities. Further, as _Foreign Policy_ indicates, courts in Portugal, France, Japan, Indonesia, and elsewhere have occasionally ordered the release of immigrants from facilities in response to COVID-19; Portugal went further, offering temporary legal status to migrants and asylum-seekers to encourage them to report and seek treatment for suspected COVID-19 cases.

Resort staff have learned many lessons in the nine months since the mountain abruptly closed, JHMR Communications Manager Anna Cole said.                                  Along with adapting on the fly to accommodate large crowds of summer visitors, JHMR has spent the time modifying and planning. The resort is implementing COVID safety measures at every level of winter operations, Cole said, from new skier limits on its tram to reengineered lift lines. The resort plans to be flexible, she said.                                  “I think the first thing we learned was, you gotta be prepared for anything, this is a very rapidly changing situation,” Cole said. Though the company strives to remain open the entire 137-day-season, she said, “if we have to close at a certain point, that’s OK. Health and safety are the first and foremost priority for our community, our guests and our staff.                                  “In the current climate with transmission rates being elevated in Wyoming … there is concern,” she said Nov. 18. “But we are hopeful these safety measures can ensure that we can open safely.”                                  JHMR is the big hitter, but its approach is shared by the smattering of smaller ski hills and snow sport lodges that dot the state.                                  At Hogadon Basin near Casper, the lodge will limit skiers and require masks in the rental shop. At Grand Targhee in Alta, operators are asking skiers to use their cars as base camps to avoid spending time indoors, and requiring face coverings at all times.                                  At Sleeping Giant Ski Area near Cody, operators are “trying to fight COVID with technology,” new owner Nick Piazza said. This includes setting up outdoor ticketing kiosks, requiring face coverings, implementing grab-and-go food options, installing outdoor seating and opening a tailgating area in the parking lot to avoid congestion in the lodge.                                  “We’re basically saying look, come in the lodge, buy what you want, eat if you have to, but don’t hang out,” Piazza said. “We’re just saying, ‘guys, spread out and enjoy it.’”                                  Piazza and his staff have made contingency plans. “Worst case scenario if we have to shut the lodge, we’re able to still operate the lifts,” he said. “I think we’re prepared for everything.”                                  COVID-19 contributed to a summer and fall spike in Wyoming outdoor-recreation tourism as travelers fled to the relative safety of the great outdoors. Public lands were so flooded that crowds and management issues taxed resources and overwhelmed many agencies.                                  But as winter arrives and temperatures drop, safely hosting visitors poses trickier challenges for destination resorts, mom-and-pop ski hills and tour operators across the state. It’s also unclear how Wyoming’s current high infection rate will impact the appetite to travel here.                                  Many in the industry say that, much like the summer, it’s hard to know exactly what will unfold. They do know one thing, however.                                  “We know there is demand for outdoor recreation this year,” Cole said. “We want to serve that need.”                                  Wyoming’s winter tourism is much smaller than summertime visitation, said Diane Shober, executive director of the Wyoming Office of Tourism. Only about 20% of all the year’s tourism occurs in the winter, she said. And the largest inventory of activities — skiing, dog-sledding, snowmobile tours, etc. — is in the Jackson region.                                  “So the concentration of product … is located right there in that northwest corner of Wyoming,” Shober said.                                  Even at one fifth of the sector’s annual activity, however, winter visitation is a critical contributor to Wyoming’s economy. Domestic and international visitors in Wyoming spent $3.95 billion in 2019, according to the Wyoming Travel Impacts Report. The Bureau of Economic Analysis recently released statistics measuring the outdoor recreation economy for all 50 states. Wyoming’s outdoor recreation value, measured as a share of state GDP, was among the highest in the country.                                  Summer tourism exceeded 2020’s pandemic-lowered expectations, Shober said, though changing habits meant visitors spent less money. The industry reported being down about 30%, she said.                                  Looking ahead, a whole host of factors, including travel restrictions, other states’ quarantine rules or diminishing desire to vacation, could affect what happens this winter. It’s crucial to get COVID-19 under control across the U.S., Shober said.                                  “If we can’t flatten this curve, it’s gonna be a tough winter,” Shober said.                                  In Jackson, the months-long juggling act required of constantly changing health restrictions and ever-adapting safety protocols throughout a very busy summer deeply challenged business owners, said Anna Olson, president/CEO of the Jackson Hole Chamber of Commerce.                                  “I think my main message here is: Businesses are feeling exhausted because of the stress of it all,” Olson said.

Even in a college football season like no other, the scene in Kansas State's locker room last Friday was surreal.
   
 Kind of like a grim reaper vibe.
   
 The Wildcats were preparing for their trip to Waco, Texas, to face Baylor, when suddenly they were short two offensive linemen. Whether left guard Josh Rivas and right guard Ben Adler tested positive for COVID-19 or were simply caught up in contact tracing, it didn't matter.
   
 They weren't going to Waco.
   
 "We tested that Friday, and we're all just waiting in the locker rooms, getting ready for meetings, and our athletic trainer came and pulled out Josh, and then Ben," said redshirt freshman Cooper Beebe. "It was then that we kind of realized when that happens, that's something we're afraid of when you see the training staff on those days.
   
 "So, we knew they would probably be out. Then it's just next man up."
   
 The next men up were redshirt freshman Taylor Poitier at right guard and junior college transfer Dawson Delforge on the left side. Beebe, who started at right tackle, later moved to left guard for the first time this season.
   
 Rivas, a junior, was the lone starting offensive lineman to log significant playing time last year, so adjusting on the fly was no small task for the Wildcats. Yet despite a devastating 32-31 loss, the Wildcats finished with 256 rushing yards and did not allow a quarterback sack.
   
 "I think we've been up and down there, but I thought we played really well last week against Baylor, especially when you have two starting guards that go out on Friday, and then we were able to reshuffle the deck with some walk- throughs on Friday night and Saturday morning," K-State coach Chris Klieman said. "We played physical and we played really well and they competed. I'm excited for those guys because it's a young group that's continuing to improve.
   
 "We've just got to sustain that and be more consistent, but they know that, as well. In the same respect, the youth that we have there and the guys we have coming back, I'm excited for the future. Coach (Conor) Riley is doing a fantastic job with those guys."
   
 Beebe, who has started all but two games at right tackle this year, said the linemen took losing Rivas and Adler in stride.
   
 "We didn't even flinch when they went down," he said. "Taylor and Dawson stepped up.
   
 "Taylor had a heck of a game, and we just took a step forward and continued to grind it out."
   
 It was the first career start for both Poitier and Delforge, a transfer from Butler Community College. Poitier, a 6-foot-2, 290-pounder from Shawnee and Bishop Miege High School, especially distinguished himself.
   
 "I thought Taylor was a real bright spot for us. We're excited about his future, just being a redshirt freshman," Klieman said. "He's going to play a ton of snaps for us at the guard position.
   
 "Sometimes you find things in adversity, and he's a kid that took advantage of the opportunity and will give us great depth in there. He's going to start again this week, and I think he's going to get better and better."
   
 Beebe, who played some as a true freshman last year but preserved his redshirt, had worked almost exclusively at tackle this season. But he was ready when asked to move inside to guard.
   
 "I knew once we lost Josh (Rivas) and Ben (Adler) right there on Friday that if coach needed me to go in, I was prepared to do so," he said. "He thought I needed to go in at left guard and I went in there.
   
 "I just felt really comfortable being on the inside. It felt more natural to me."
   
 While it may never feel natural to lose players midweek during a pandemic, K-State has still been able to piece together a team without missing any games. The Wildcats wrap up their regular season and celebrate senior day Saturday with an 11 a.m. kickoff against Texas at Bill Snyder Family Stadium.
   
 Poitier, and possibly Delforge, will again start at guard unless Beebe makes the move from tackle and Kaitori Leveston takes his place.
   
 "If we can have people prepared like we did with Taylor and them, it doesn't really affect me because we have other people that can step up and play in that big role," Beebe said. "So it doesn't bother me too much."

"Therefore, life, if it ever originated on Mars, may have followed liquid water to progressively greater depths," Rutgers said.                          "At such depths, life could have been sustained by hydrothermal (heating) activity and rock-water reactions," Ojha said. "So, the subsurface may represent the longest-lived habitable environment on Mars."                            Our knowledge of Mars and its lineage of water has been expanding at a rapid clip. Recent studies have pointed to hidden ponds of briny water under the Martian polar ice.                           Rovers will continue to scour the Martian surface for hints of ancient life, but we may one day want to peer deeper under the planet's skin to fully understand its history of habitability.

Much like many Korean dramas, “Cinderella and the Four Knights” tells you exactly what’s coming right in the title. The drama starts by explaining the life of Eun Ha-won, the main character. She works with her dad, helping him deliver fried chicken. Meanwhile, all the “knights” grew up rich and act however they please. One of the knights, Kang Hyun-min, is a party animal, and when he is out with his friends, he accepts a challenge to take the first girl who walks into the club to his dad’s second wedding.

The oily water was also reportedly taken to other parts of the vessel to be improperly stored before it was dumped overboard.
 Investigators discovered more than 60,000 gallons of oily water in what's known as the "duct keel," a tube measuring three feet around that ran about 400 feet along the bottom of the ship, court filings state. The duct typically contains other piping, electrical wiring and lighting and isn't designed to hold oily water. Prosecutors said it took "several days and a third-party contractor to properly clean out" after the hoard of waste was discovered.
 A laundry sink on board the vessel was additionally contaminated with oil, as crew members had dumped oily water and waste oil from other parts of the ship down the drain that led directly into the ocean.
 None of the improper disposals were accurately logged as federally mandated on the ship's record book, prosecutors said.
 Pacific Carriers Limited pleaded guilty to eight felony charges in three districts -- North Carolina, Texas and Louisiana -- on Tuesday, court filings show. The ship's chief engineer, Wenguang Ye, also pleaded guilty to falsifying the oil record book. Ye was fined $5,500 and banned from the U.S. for a year, according to the Justice Department's news release.
 This wasn't the ship's first run-in with the law.
 In 2008, prosecutors said the M/V Pac Antares was prosecuted in Wilmington for similar crimes involving the illegal discharge of oily bilge water and was fined $2.1 million.

DALLAS - American Airlines is taking its long-grounded Boeing 737 Max jets out of storage, updating key flight-control software, and flying the planes in preparation for the first flights with paying passengers later this month.                          The airline invited press reporters and photographers on board one of the planes Wednesday to demonstrate its confidence in the plane's safety.                          All Max jets worldwide were grounded in March 2019 after the second of two crashes that together killed 346 people. Last month, the Federal Aviation Administration approved changes — mainly in flight-control software — that will allow airlines to resume flying the plane.                          American planned to explain Wednesday the steps it has taken to bring the planes out of storage and make the FAA-required changes.                          American is likely to be the first carrier to put passengers on Max jets, beginning Dec. 29 with once-a-day round trips between New York and Miami. In the meantime, the airline has been flying the plane with employees on board and, now, reporters and photographers.                          Some relatives of people who died in the crashes — and who still believe the plane is unsafe — expressed outrage at both Boeing and American over what they termed a publicity stunt.                          Zipporah Kuria, a British citizen whose father died in the second Max crash, said Boeing and the FAA should instead turn over documents on changes made to fix the plane and how they were tested. The company has withheld the documents, saying they cover trade secrets.                          “I feel like Boeing is using the press to leverage public trust instead of actually genuinely earning public trust,” she said. “I'm really disgusted by the whole thing and the fact that American Airlines would pay for that. Their focus is more about the profit and corporate interest than it is about consumer safety.”

From first appearances, this budget has no surprises, and continues from the Unite and Recover Strategy and COVID-19 Fiscal and Economic review delivered in September this year.
 The focus on Queensland made and job creation through shovel ready projects across the State remains prominent.
 Increased or new funding in a number of arenas includes wellness professionals in our schools, the palliative care strategy and suicide prevention initiatives. Extra frontliners for Queensland’s emergency sectors includes firefighters and police, and given the ongoing management of COVID-19, essential.
 Free TAFE and free apprenticeships now include those up to 25 years of age which will assist both our youngsters and business who are seeking apprentices in multiple industries within Noosa.
 Government will now have a 25 per cent target in procurement from our small to medium business, embedding non price related considerations of social and environmental outcomes. Assistance in many forms includes the extremely popular Small Business Adaption Grants and retention of other initiatives such as payroll tax refund and payment waivers.
 Noosa specifics as below includes the Cooloola Great Walk and Tewantin netball courts. Stages 2 and 3 of Beckmans Rd intersection was not expected to be in the mix given the progress of designs, however trust that TMR and Council will escalate efforts to have those ready for the next Budget in June, unbelievably only seven months away.
 Additionally, other projects in our ‘list’ including upgrades to sports facilities and the Regen Hub have a way to go before funding consideration, though the smaller projects should have designs and costings ready for grants in the first part of 2021.
 The urgent priority as outlined to the minister last week, is to accommodate a resolution to the impacts to our hinterland communities of the inappropriate volume of heavy haulage that is impacting residents, businesses and infrastructure.
 With designs and costings not expected until the new year, and community consultation desired, consideration of this cannot be undertaken until then.
 Overall, at a glance as stated at the beginning, no surprises.

 # Feds crack down on service animals on airplanes, close emotional support loophole
 By David Koenig

 The government has decided that when it comes to air travel, only dogs can be service animals, and companions used for emotional support don’t count.
 The Transportation Department issued a final rule Wednesday that aims to settle years of tension between airlines and passengers who bring their pets on board for free by saying they need them for emotional support.

The Bench agreed that the Government of Liberia proceeded wrongly and therefore, put a halt to the printing of only three propositions of the ballot paper.

Which is why the events of  the last fortnight perhaps provide a clue to where the ‘real’ opposition to the Modi government’s dominance lies. It doesn’t lie in the political opposition which is weak and directionless, where the leaders of  the main national opposition party struggle to go beyond collegiate-style twitter debates. It doesn’t lie in democratic institutions that have been emasculated over time. It doesn’t lie in a mostly pliant media which has, with few exceptions, lost the capacity to tell truth to power. It doesn’t lie in the urban middle class which is way too hypnotized by political Hindutva and the razzmatazz ‘spectacle’ of  laser shows by the ghats of  Varanasi to even contemplate questioning the larger than life leadership on chaotic blunders like demonetisation.

Le Petit Chevalier Vineyard and Farm Winery got an update back in May, adding a wine tasting room to their decade old dream of owning a vineyard. While plans were delayed due to stay-at-home orders and state closures, the business has still been a roaring success.
 Mark Chevalier and his wife Margit started the six-acre vineyard back in 2009 after moving to the area from Europe. Margit grew up on a farm in Germany and had family friends that had been in the wine business for multiple generations. After the couple decided to move the family to the states, they wanted to try the business for themselves.
 At that point, the business was selling their grapes to other wineries for use in making wine.
 With their scenic location by Hocking Hills State Park, many tourists would stop by asking if there was wine they could purchase from the vineyard. The obvious demand helped push the Chevalier’s into taking the plunge and opening a full winery.
 They began building back in 2018 with funding from the Vinton County National Bank. The Chevalier’s also enlisted help from their friend and builder Dean Thompson who based the structure of the building on an 1800s barn design. The farmhouse was built in about 1880 so the choice was made to keep the architecture similar throughout the vineyard and winery.
 Guests can also stay upstairs at the winery in a bed and breakfast run by Margit beginning back in November of 2019. According to Mark, beds have been booked, “literally almost every night.” Most of the quests they’ve had have been tourists hoping to stay just a bit longer in the area after a visit to the local state parks.
 Their first release of wines came out this year produced with only the grapes they grew right here in Vinton County. Six different wines were produced with two already selling out.
 The 2020 harvest has just wrapped up, bringing in about 15,000 pounds of grapes that are currently fermenting in tanks. Once spring comes around, there will be anywhere from six to eight new wines for locals and tourists alike to come by and sample.
 The possibility of adding on an apple orchard to the already sprawling grounds has also been considered. Blackberries from a grower in Lexington were used to make a wine that is set to be released in about six weeks time.
 Mark explained, “We are going to do some fruit wines from other growers but all the grape wines we do are just from our own grapes.”
 Looking to the future, the Chevalier’s are hoping to incorporate dining into their winery as well.
 “Everybody that comes in is curious about the wines but always the second question is ‘Do you guys serve food?’” stated Mark.
 The original plan was never to serve food but, much like the demand for wine showed the owners a need for opening the winery, new demand has shown a need for dining options. The Chevalier’s are currently working on this next step with the health department and are planning a small menu.
 Further expansion into the retail sphere has been in the works as well. Currently, the Inn and Spa at Cedar Falls and Handy Mart grocery store in Jackson both carry Le Petit Chevalier label wines.
 When asked about the possibility of opening a restaurant, Mark Chevalier said it could happen and the importance of location for a restaurant, “Vinton County is a beautiful place. We’ve got such a beautiful scenic location up here on the ridge and when people come here they are just amazed at how beautiful it is.”

The rules would require the companies to "publicly disclose consistent, transparent diversity statistics regarding their board of directors" and require the Nasdaq-listed companies to have "at least two diverse directors" or provide an explanation as to why they do not. Criteria for a "diverse" director includes hiring an individual "who self-identifies as either an underrepresented minority or LGBTQ" and another who "self-identifies as female." There is no mention of hiring a biological female, meaning the role could, hypothetically, go to a transgender woman -- a biological male who merely identifies as a woman -- and still meet the diversity requirement:

Gina Force
 Indiana County First Assistant District Attorney Gina Force has announced her plans to seek election as judge on the Indiana County Court of Common Pleas.
 President Judge William Martin announced he will retire from full-time service on the Indiana County Common Pleas Court bench Jan. 4 after serving almost 30 years on the court.
 “I feel blessed to take the knowledge and experience I have gained throughout my career and service to the community and continue this service on our courts,” Force said in a news release. “In my position as first assistant district attorney, I have had the opportunity to work alongside the brave men and women in law enforcement to keep our families, neighbors and communities safe.
 “If elected to serve our county as judge, I plan to apply the law in a fair and unbiased manner with the same goal in mind.”
 “As we have witnessed, the judiciary plays an incredibly important part in our daily lives. It is critical we elect those with the experience and understanding of the role of the judiciary to interpret the law as written. As a textualist, I believe that words have meaning and in running for this judicial seat, I pledge to never legislate from the bench.
 “I look forward to speaking with voters and discussing why my experiences and Indiana County values have uniquely qualified me for this important position.”
 After graduating from Marion Center Area High School, Force attended Penn State University where she graduated with high distinction with a Bachelor of Science in Crime, Law & Justice and a minor in sociology.
 Force earned her law degree from Syracuse University College of Law. During her time at Syracuse, she participated in the Elder Law Clinic and Phi Alpha Delta. During a summer program, Force worked as a judicial law clerk in the Woolwich Crown Court in Greenwich, England. Adjoining the Category A Belmarsh Prison, Woolwich Crown Court is unique in that it serves as a higher criminal court, having heard some of the most egregious and high-profile cases in England, affording Force the opportunity to observe and participate in a number of criminal jury trials.
 Following law school, Force worked for a local practice before opening her general law practice Ryen-Force Law P.C. in May of 2016. She said her private practice has included broad representation in family law, business law and real estate matters.
 Force has served the district attorney’s office since October of 2016 and was promoted to her current position in January 2019. In this role, she has served as primary and co-counsel on jury and non-jury trials ranging from summary offenses to homicide cases. Force has served as the assistant who performs the legal research and drafting of legal motions, pleadings, briefs and appeals on behalf of the commonwealth at both local and appellate levels. She has represented the state at thousands of preliminary hearings wherein the commonwealth is tasked with presenting a prima facie case.
 Since 2016 Force has served as a parent advocate for Children & Youth Services, where she is involved in supporting parents and children of Indiana County by working to reunify and strengthen families. In this role, she has served as legal counsel for hundreds of parents and/or legal guardians who have had their children removed from their care. This has involved working with various local agencies to support parents dealing with mental health issues, drug and alcohol dependency and/or prison or jail time.
 She is also a member of Law Day Committee and solicitor for the Borough of Plumville, the Indiana County Prison Board and VFW Post 1989.
 She married her husband, Christopher Force, in August of 2016, and they welcomed their son, Kash, this August. She said that both she and her husband feel blessed to call Indiana County their home.

I'm surprised not more attention on here on this game, but I guess people are just skeptical the game gets played. We know about the Ravens missing, but the Steelers have a few out, including RB Conner and now starting center Pouncey. If Tomlin feels he has the upper hand, and based on the spread, one would think he feels that way, he will sit on the ball after getting a lead. I'm not sure what we get out of RG3. What a great year he had......in 2012. He hasn't had much activity in recent years. Do the Steelers put 8 in a box and dare RG3 to throw? I probably would, considering how Baltimore shredded them on the ground several weeks ago.

Though accounts differ on the "golden age of video games," most historical accounts place it roughly in the late 1970s with the appearance of "Space Invaders," "Asteroids" and "Pac-Man."
   
 While these games were fine, my favorite arcade game to play was "Galaga." I spent countless hours and a small fortune in quarters playing this game at the various arcades in Topeka.
   
 Though these arcades now exist only in my memory, I fondly recall walking, riding my bike and eventually driving to these places to spend money and time with my friends. Places like Showbiz Pizza, Little Italy, Golddiggers and Aladdin's Castle provided an opportunity to see people and to be seen by others.
   
 On other occasions, I might meet up with friends or jump into a car with some buddies as we made our way around town. The sights and sounds of the arcade provided endless stimulation while I tried my best to set new high scores on the games or to achieve a personal best on the different machines.
   
 Recent films and television shows like Adam Sandler's "Pixels" and "Stranger Things" have introduced younger generations to these games. Now with tablets and smartphones, I can download virtually any video game to my devices. While the graphics might be even better than the original and the game play free, it is still not the same as the arcade experience.
   
 I enjoy playing "Galaga" on my iPad, but still not have found the same level of comfort or enjoyment as I did playing in the arcade.
   
 Within the past 10 years, I have seen some arcades re-emerge in Topeka, Lawrence and Kansas City. Last year, I took my kids to one arcade where they had the chance to play some games they had normally only played on consoles like PlayStation. It whet my appetite for the "real thing."
   
 A couple of weeks ago, the holiday catalog from Best Buy arrived in the mail. One of the items that caught my eye was the "Pacman" 40th Anniversary Edition Arcade Machine. Knowing my kids enjoyed "Pac-Man," I found myself more excited the game included "Galaga."
   
 When the huge box arrived on my doorstep, I found the task of assembling the machine daunting. Even more challenging was how to hide the fact I had purchased this machine from my kids. Thankfully, the game arrived when I was alone in my apartment. I opened the box and hid the components from my family until I had the chance to spend a few evenings assembling it.
   
 I nearly held my breath as I turned in the machine for the first time. Seeing the banner "Pac-Man" banner light up and hearing the familiar sounds of both "Pac-Man" and "Galaga" gave me chills.
   
 It has been in nearly constant use in the last couple of weeks, though I have admirably resisted spending all my free time trying to achieve 200,000 points on the game. Hearing the various sounds of "Galaga" has proved quite nostalgic: the firing of bullets, the captured ship, the challenging stages, all bring me back to my adolescence.
   
 If I need to shelter for the next few months, at least I have "Pac-Man" and "Galaga" to keep me company.

“Normally it takes a week, two weeks to hopefully get back to where he was. But we take that into consideration. I hope a guy like Myles does or could get right back to form quickly, but I don’t think there are any assumptions that it’ll be that way,” coach Brian Flores said Wednesday as the Dolphins prepare for this Sunday’s home game against the Cincinnati Bengals.
 “We’ve got some other backs. Normally, we’ll rotate them.”
 After Gaskin, who has 387 yards and two touchdowns, first landed on injured reserve on Nov. 5, veteran Jordan Howard was the Dolphins’ starting running back for one game.
 That was before Ahmed, a rookie who played with Gaskin at the University of Washington, seized the starting role for the next two games, including a 85-yard outing in Arizona, which led to the eventual release of Howard, who scored four goal-line touchdowns earlier in the season.
 Ahmed suffered a shoulder injury against the Denver Broncos on Nov. 22, causing him to miss the New York Jets game, which saw Breida earn his first start of the season.
 Breida fumbled in the third quarter and the Dolphins turned to Washington, a five-year veteran acquired at the trade deadline.
 Washington, a four-year contributor with the Oakland Raiders, was praised by Dolphins running back coach Eric Studesville for his preparation, work ethic and toughness, which could lead to further opportunities with Gaskin and Ahmed on the mend.
 “I just think overall, I think he’s got a skill set that can help us and we’re looking forward to his skill set continuing to develop,” Studesville said of Washington, who had 51 yards rushing with two catches for 11 yards out of the backfield.

“I want to plead with our community to follow the recommendations, no matter what you think of them,” board member Tamara Leeper said. “There are people walking around without masks and this will lead us to closure. Our students have to follow the rules and our adults should, too.”
 “I think we should stay the course,” director Cinda Brode said. “We have done a good job so far. Our administration needs congratulations. And the students need to know what a good job they have done and how important it is to keep on doing it. … I hope adults will follow their lead so everybody can stay in school.”
 Director Barbara Barker charged district residents with making sure that the schools aren’t closed again.
 “This was not because of the spread in the schools but from what students and their parents do outside of school,” Barker said. “I’m asking each one of you to go home, make sure your neighbors know that if the community does not take this seriously, the schools will close again.”
 Schroth suggested that the district has some wiggle room for COVID-19 cases before the winter holiday break presents another opportunity to recover.
 “Ultimately our goal is to get our kids back in their seats in their classes and keep them there as long as we can.” Schroth said. “In the short term, we really need to sprint toward Dec. 18, the Friday before Christmas. The break starts the following week and that could provide another 14 to 17 days including weekends when we could be remote or off for the holidays.”
 Simultaneous with the board and administrators’ remarks in the meeting, some parents and teachers among the 75 spectators to the online session offered their praise to school nurses and special education teachers in their text comments in a chat window.
 Vuckovich said that although the schools would return to the overall mixture of at-home and in-school learning that began Sept. 8, parents still have the option to keep their children out of the buildings for synchronous or asynchronous at-home classes.
 He also acknowledged that the district’s need to quarantine some students, as identified through contact tracing in a bid to curb the coronavirus from the schools, has been inconvenient for families who want their children to continue taking in-school classes.
 The only exception to the current plan for 100 percent at-home learning is the decision to resume in-school education of at-risk students with individual education plans (IEPs) as early as Wednesday.
 In a closing public comment period, district resident Ashley Clouser choked back tears as she told the school board of the importance of keeping her special-needs child on a consistent schedule of classes with the same teachers in the same rooms every day.
 “In the spring when remote learning occurred, my son has autism … it did not go well,” Clouser said. “He had to be hospitalized for two weeks for behaviors that he developed because of the inconsistency and lack of routine.
 “I don’t use my son’s school district as a day care or a babysitting service. My son needs to be in school, and this meeting tonight has given him the ability to be able to succeed in his education by being in the classroom. I am extremely appreciative of Mike (Vuckovich) and Justin Zahorchak (district special education coordinator) and for Jackie Bartolini (special education teacher), everyone who has been advocating for those at-risk students to have their opportunity.”
 Vuckovich reminded board members and spectators that the district is liable to revert to all at-home learning once more if COVID-19 caseloads increase.
 “We have to be honest and realistic that there could be another closure, based on the number of cases we have,” he said. “If we want to stay open, we have to stick with the plan we have developed. This attestation requires us to do that. I was called a lot of names; I was called a coward (when he ordered the shutdown). We have to protect our students and our staff.
 “I don’t know what the future holds … but I will follow the same decision- making. It’s important to be transparent and that we are going to follow our plan.”

We all know that one person who’s a genius on paper, but a total wash when it comes to completing basic tasks. As an employer, sometimes someone high achieving can be tougher than simply spotting a high GPA on their resume.

Jack N. LeFevre      Hanover - Jack N. LeFevre, 86, met his eternal rest on Friday, November 27, 2020 at UPMC Harrisburg. His wife, Ann Rae (Keeney) LeFevre, died June 29, 2008. They were married 41 ½ years.      Jack was born in Venice, FL, on March 1, 1934 son of the late Earl Resser and Mary Romaine (Neauman) LeFevre.      Surviving are daughter Susan Mattern and husband Robert of York, PA, granddaughter Sara Ann Moose and husband Justin of Greencastle, PA, and great granddaughter Danielle Mae Moose. He was predeceased by a sister, Barbara L. Tanger in 2011 and brother-in-law, John C. "Jack" Tanger, III.      Jack was employed 43 ¾ years at the Evening Sun where he was sports editor from 1963 - 1984 and national editor until his retirement on March 1, 1996. He graduated from Eichelberger Senior High School with the Class of 1952, was co- manager of the 1952 South Penn Conference basketball champions, sports editor of the Orange and Black, and the Nornir.      He was a member of the original Big 33 Panel, which selected All-State Football Teams starting in 1959. Working with founder Armin Hostetter, he helped form the York- Adams Elementary Football League in 1969 and served as commissioner and schedule maker. Jack competed in the Industrial Golf League at South Hills Golf Club and was a member of the Hanover Bronze and Aluminum team which won the championship eight straight seasons in the 1980's.      Jack was a member of the Hanover Public School Athletic Hall of Fame selection committee. The inaugural class was inducted during the 2015-16 School Year. He worked with South Central Hall of Fame writers, Cap Grenier (predecessor at the Sun), Wib Davis, Vaden Richards, Don Brezm and Bob Kenworthy in selecting All-South Penn teams in football and basketball. Jack covered Hanover Football alongside former Gettysburg College coach Bob Hulton who was a sports correspondent for the York Gazette.      He was Lincoln Speedway publicist from 1976-1990 and was a lifetime retired member of the Golf Writers Association of America. Jack was a season ticket holder with the Baltimore Colts during the Johnny Unitas Era (1957-1972).      His hobbies include golf (three holes-in-one) and yard work. In retirement, he was a 9-hole regular with good friends Bob Matthews, Don Bair, Jim Barnhart, and Jim Brenner at South Hills. A die-hard Brooklyn Dodger Fan, Jack had the misfortune of attending the 1956 World Series game in which Don Larsen of the Yankees pitched a perfect game against the Dodgers with an equally ardent Yankee fan, Larry Gruver. Fortunately for Jack, he saw Johnny Padres pitch in game 3 of the 1955 World Series, the first-ever series won by the Dodgers, and it was against the hated Yankees.      Jack was a loyal member of St. Matthew Lutheran Church where he was captain of Usher Team 4.      Following cremation, graveside services will be conducted by Rev. Dr. Kathy Vitalis Hoffman and Rev. Faye C. Snyder at 11:00am, Saturday, December 12, 2020 at Mount Olivet Cemetery, 725 Baltimore Street, Hanover, PA.      In lieu of flowers, memorial contributions may be made in memory of Jack to St. Matthew Lutheran Church, 30 West Chestnut Street, Hanover, PA 17331.      The Kenworthy Funeral Home & Crematory, Inc., 269 Frederick Street, Hanover, PA has been entrusted by the family with the funeral arrangements.

The Subcommittee on Prevention of Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment underscores this recommendation in advising States Parties to the Optional Protocol to the CAT to “review the use of immigration detention centres and closed refugee camps with a view to reducing their populations to the lowest possible level.” UNHCR, together with the International Organization for Migration, WHO, and the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, urges that migrants held in overcrowded and unsanitary conditions “be released without delay” in light of “the lethal consequences a COVID-19 outbreak would have.” Most States, however, have proven reluctant to respond to these calls to release detained migrants, likely fearing that, once released, the migrants may not return. The consequences of this reluctance may be deadly.

For CIA to remain indispensable, it will need to prioritize service to a more varied set of customers beyond the president, break organizational stovepipes once and for all in favor of an integrated mission-focused business model, and cultivate a new generation of leaders with the experience and temperament necessary to support these necessary evolutions.

When Powell was asked if he agreed with that interpretation, Powell deferred to Mnuchin.                                  Powell did say Wednesday that the Fed had issued its statement to make it clear that the central bank was committed to providing further support to the economy.                                  “We were concerned that the public might misinterpret (Mnuchin’s action) as the Fed stepping back and thinking our work is done,” Powell said.                                  Asked what Congress should put in a relief bill that could pass in the lame-duck session this month, Mnuchin said his priority would be an authorization allowing the Treasury to use $140 billion in left-over funds to provide small businesses with a second round of Paycheck Protection Program loans.                                  The PPP program allowed businesses to get loans to keep their workers on the payroll with the loan forgiven if the business met certain terms geared at avoiding layoffs.                                  Mnuchin said Congress should also consider extending some of the emergency unemployment benefit programs that are being used by around 11 million workers. Those programs will expire at the end of this month without Congressional action.                                  Lawmakers have been unable to reach agreement on further economic relief after many programs in the $2 trillion CARE Act expired in August. Democrats are seeking more funds than the GOP-controlled Senate has been willing to provide.                                  On Tuesday a bipartisan group of senators introduced a aid bill totalling around $908 billion, raising hopes that the legislative impasse might be broken. Mnuchin said he was in discussions with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who since this summer has insisted on a larger bill. Mnuchin said unfortunately Pelosi has insisted that a half-a-loaf measure would not be good enough.                                  “I would encourage Congress in the lame duck," Mnuchin said. "Let’s get something done.”                                  He said has been keeping President Donald Trump abreast of the negotiations every day.
