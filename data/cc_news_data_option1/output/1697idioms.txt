Levin admitted to some worry about how stay-at-home orders would affect the amount of material he needed to fuel his infotainment empire at TMZ. But celebrities still need attention, even if they're not out and about, and Levin found out there's still plenty of things to talk about. (Photo by Chris Pizzello/Invision/AP, File)

The Mellanox acquisition is unique. Huang referred to the company as a “one- of-a-kind asset that could take 20 years to build from scratch,” which was why the company was willing to pay such a large premium (while it was just a 14.3% premium to Mellanox’s stock price just prior to the announcement, it is more than 50% above the stock price before reports first emerged of interest in the company) When a company like Nvidia, given its history of making markets from scratch, decides to make such a significant acquisition, you can be sure that it was seen as hypercritical piece of the company’s plan for sustainable growth.

Mariana Makramalla of Madaba, Jordan, who usually works in her family's mosaics workshop. Typically, Madaba attracts tourists who also visit nearby Mount Nebo, where the Bible says Moses was granted a view of the Promised Land. But Jordan closed its borders in mid-March, just before peak tourist season, as it tried to halt the the virus. During the closure, Makramalla, 24, and her 27-year-old brother Majed, visit the two-room workshop from time to time to tidy up. But she feels a bit aimless these days; she misses the structure of her time spent in the workshop.

OnePlus has taken the wraps off its latest flagship, the OnePlus 8 Pro. Along with its silky blue finish, the phone packs a multicamera setup that includes a standard zoom, a super wide-angle lens and a 3x zoom. It impressed Lynn La in her full OnePlus 8 Pro review, but how does this camera system stack up against the iPhone 11 Pro, one of the best phone cameras around?
 The 11 Pro has a similar camera setup, which also includes a standard zoom, a super wide-angle lens and a 2x zoom. The camera on this phone has seriously impressed me -- it even replaced my DSLR on a recent road trip around Scotland \-- so the OnePlus 8 Pro has a lot to live up to here.

All the computing power in the world won’t matter if the network can’t harness it. Nvidia plus Mellanox makes that achievable with more than just hardware — in a nutshell, this combination is the most comprehensive software for AI and Networking. I expect Mellanox to be able to handle the networking needs of even greater volumes of Nvidia-based clusters. This is a very important competitive advantage, as it will enable Nvidia to immediately support customers’ AI-intensive computing needs and in turn put pressure on the likes of Intel

That lens flare in night mode continues to be an issue here, with the OnePlus 8 Pro's shot looking like there's a big orange patch in the left side of the image. The iPhone's photo doesn't have the same issue, resulting in a better- looking image.
 Overall I'm impressed with how well the OnePlus 8 Pro performed in this test, particularly given its cheaper price tag. While it doesn't consistently provide the same rich colors as the iPhone, it still manages to take some great-looking shots with spot-on exposure. It takes the win when it comes to zoom ability, but If you're particularly into your night mode images, the iPhone is still the way to go.
