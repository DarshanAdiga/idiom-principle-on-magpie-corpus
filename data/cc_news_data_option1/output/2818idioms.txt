Hayden Gochneaur was looking forward to his first year at Harpool Middle School: sports, making new friends, more girls around his own age.
 As can be said about most anything, the pandemic changed those plans.
 The 11-year-old attended Liberty Christian School through the third grade before being home-schooled for the past few years.
 Damon Gochneaur, Hayden’s dad, said all three of his children will remain home-schooled for now. The family isn’t alone in its reluctance to have children attend in-person classes, but they are in the minority, according to some recent school district surveys.
 Hitesh Adhikari, father of a preschooler, and Dawn Moreland, mother of two high schoolers, decided to take advantage of Denton ISD’s online options for the coming school year.
 But Louie Pancoast said his three children plan to head back to campuses when they open. His oldest daughter, 18-year-old Jaden, is enrolled at North Texas Central College. Jesse, 15, goes to Denton High School. Judah, 4, attends KidZone Academy at GracePointe Church.
 He said the family reached a consensus to return to schools after talking over the risks and benefits that accompany in-person classes. In fact, he said they were feeling safer than ever with in-person classes with the extra health screenings and campus cleanings.
 “We are 100 percent comfortable and have zero concerns about our kids going back to school in-person this year,” Pancoast said by phone Friday morning.
 He said the family would abide by any safety measures schools might put in place, but he finds most anything beyond health screenings and thorough cleaning is counterproductive.
 He said he doesn’t judge people who wear masks out and about, but he doesn’t think children need to be worrying about that sort of thing while at school.
 He said there’s a lot of confusing information about the virus spreading around, but “from what I’ve seen, not going to school is far worse than anything else that’s going on.”
 Adhikari said his daughter, 3-year-old Aira, started going to the Gonzalez School for Young Children this past January — just three months before Denton ISD closed schools and sent students online.
 Now, Adhikari said they plan to keep Aira home and take advantage of whatever online resources they can.
 “She’s only a 3-year-old, so we don’t want to take a risk,” he said.
 He said he’s hoping to see a vaccine for the coronavirus. Then he would consider sending Aira to in-person classes. He’d like to have her back in the classroom in January if possible.
 He said children around his daughter’s age simply have trouble staying a safe distance apart and noticing potential symptoms of COVID-19 in themselves.
 Overall, Adhikari said he has been worried by the country’s handling of the pandemic. He pointed toward European countries and how aggressive public health responses have curbed the pandemic and allowed for the safe school openings.
 “In the U.S., I think, politics are playing a major role in the health of students,” he said.
 On the local level, he said he doubts Denton ISD has the resources to implement the safety procedures needed to make him confident about in-person classes.
 Gochneaur and Moreland agreed that not nearly enough is being done to make in- person classes seem safe.
 The three parents all mentioned the need for a functioning vaccine. Other common prerequisites for their confidence in the school system were widespread testing and lower numbers of people testing positive for the virus.
 “I think we just need to feel confident that we have the pandemic somewhat under control,” Gochneaur said of his family.
 He said his family weren’t sure any of the people charged with managing the virus had a grasp on what was going on, describing them as deer trying to stand up on solid ice.
 He and Moreland agreed that teachers have a mountain to climb in responding to ever-changing guidance during the pandemic.
 Moreland, whose two youngest sons attend Ryan High School, said she comes from a long line of teachers, so she appreciates the service they provide. That factored in her family’s decision to have Jeremiah, 16, and Nathan, 15, take classes online this coming semester.
 “Am I putting [teachers] at risk by sending my child to a classroom?” she recalled asking herself.
 Even though Jeremiah will miss out on hands-on classes, such as welding, and Nathan will miss his sophomore year of football, she said they were each handling the mutual decision to stay home fairly well.
 She said the current situation is smooth compared with how choppy the move online in March was.
 “They’ve kind of acclimated to the change,” Moreland said.

Soccer which is the other name for the beautiful game tossed around on lush green turfs, otherwise described as the king of sports. Football is played on the pitch, not inside court rooms or tribunals. Verdicts are instantaneous based on rules which are interpreted by the referees relying on his assistants to arrive at decisions where he is in doubt. The referees’ decisions used to be final until the introduction of the Video Assistant Referee (VAR) system was introduced to help match officials have a second look at scenes which the human eyes cannot capture due to the speed of the game. The essence of VAR is to reduce controversies on the pitch. This isn’t not to say the decisions on the game cannot be decided in courts, although FIFA frowns at such acts, preferring the aggrieved exploits the inbuilt mechanism for such issues to seek redress.

MARSHFIELD -- The population of Atlantic bluefin tuna is rebounding off the eastern seaboard, which should mean a banner year for fisherman but the normally high-priced fish is not in demand as its main markets are closed or doing little business during the pandemic.
 "It's all about supply and demand and there's no demand for them, so the dealers don't want to keep buying them if they're not able to keep selling them," fisherman Greg Ares, based out of Green Harbor in Marshfield, said. "Maybe within the next week or two, restaurants will be opened up in the U.S., sushi restaurants, and they will purchase our bluefin tuna. Even if I get $6 a pound, that's good enough to keep going."
 There are two types of bluefin tuna fishermen -- those who use a harpoon and those who use a rod and reel, the latter making up the vast majority of commercial licenses.

 In a Facebook post, the American Bluefin Tuna Association told its members that five high-volume seafood dealers are trying to manage the decrease in demand and would not even buy tuna, caught by rod and reel, until Thursday. Even then, they will not accept fish three days a week.
 "Each dealer will decide individually how many fish they are prepared to pick up," they said in the post. "Do not assume that if your dealer took a fish from you a few days ago that he will take a fish from you today. If you have not checked in with your dealer prior to going fishing, your fish will not be picked up."
 The message is signed by Chubby Fish Inc., Compass Seafood LLC, Sea Fresh USA, Red's Best and North Atlantic Traders. Sea Fresh USA referred questions to other dealers and Chubby Fish, Compass Seafood and North Atlantic Traders did not respond to requests for comment.
 The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration even took note of the decreased demand in a bulletin issued July 10.
 "NOAA Fisheries encourages operators of vessels authorized to sell bluefin tuna to contact their local Atlantic tuna dealers before departing on a trip to determine if dealers are willing to purchase bluefin," the agency said in the bulletin. "Some dealers may not accept or buy bluefin given uncertainty regarding current market conditions."
 American Bluefin Tuna Association President David Schalit said price has not really changed.
 "What has changed is the demand," he said. "The demand is way, way off. Restaurants in the U.S. are barely open, some are maybe selling takeaway, some are still closed and in the Boston or New York areas, you see tables on the sidewalk."
 Higher-end restaurants, where most of the bluefin catch goes, are still mostly closed, he said.
 "That market has diminished," Schalit said. "If it's possible to maintain some control on landings, we might just get through this without too much damage. That's the objective for everyone, stay in business until next year."
 Red's Best founder Jared Auerbach said demand for bluefin has been a problem since last year, when he started to get serious about trying to match the supply of fish with the demand.
 "We're only going to make the decision with the fisherman, to go out and kill a fish, if we're very confident there's a market for the fish," he said. "It's a big departure from our normal way of doing business, but I feel good about it."
 Auerbach stays in contact with the fishermen he buys from.
 "If the market sucks, I say, 'Don't fish today,'" he said.
 There are two big markets for bluefin tuna -- the U.S. and Japan, and the market share of each changes depending on the season. The early season, starting in June, is mostly lean fish who just migrated to the North Atlantic, where they will feed and fatten up before their next migration. The summer catch is mostly sold domestically, in part fueled by demand at seafood restaurants driven by summer tourism, Schalit said.
 "This summer is a weird summer," he said.
 As summer turns to fall and the fish get fatter, and more desirable to the Japanese market, the number of fish exported increases, an estimated 40 percent of the entire catch. Exporting the fish requires flights between Japan and Boston or New York, which have been missing in recent months, but have begun to slowly increase, Schalit said.
 High quality tuna in Japan can sell for millions of dollars.
 Auerbach said the quality of the fish in the summer is part of the reason there is so little demand because buyers know the longer they wait, the higher quality the fish will be.
 Harpoon fisherman Eric Hesse, based out of Chatham, said he appreciates the efforts of the dealers to manage the supply by being clear with their fishermen that the demand is limited.
 "It's a tough year to sell anything," he said. "I think they've done a good job. Anything tuna-related is controversial and there are competing interests. It's a reasonable thing they've done to let everyone survive."
 Hesse estimated at least there are 1,000 fishermen catching tuna by rod and reel once the season starts in earnest. Tuna don't usually start biting until the middle of July.
 "Even if 10 percent come in with a fish, they're going to crush the demand," he said.
 If there is no demand, and dealers are unwilling to take fish they never agreed to accept, that will mean fish killed for no reason, he said.
 "There could be some waste ahead, and that's tragic," Hesse said.
 Supply without demand
 The bluefin tuna fishery has recently rebounded. Last year, there was a problem with oversupply, Schalit said.
 "Too many fish were coming in at the same time, creating a bottleneck," he said.
 Auerbach said he began trying to match demand with the supply he was receiving from fishermen in 2019.
 "We had the same problem last year," he said. "We stopped buying for four or fives days in July. We had to stop buying in the summer of 2019 because the supply was far greater than the demand. Fishing's really good right now and demand was struggling last year. This is not a COVID story. This is a lack of positive news story."
 In January, the Monterey Bay Aquarium's Seafood Watch, a program that rates the sustainability of specific fish stocks, upgraded the Atlantic bluefin to the "good alternative" status, said that overfishing is unlikely and that measures to rebuild the fishery "may be working."
 Auerbach said the biggest problem with bluefin tuna is the negative perception people still have of the fish stock.
 "No large customer of mine offers bluefin, for fear of backlash from the sustainability community," he said.
 Bluefin only ends up in restaurants because supermarkets "won't go near it" because the public's perception is the stocks are overfished. It is still available from his company directly. While demand for fish from restaurants has gone down, demand from supermarkets has stayed even, which does nothing for bluefin fishermen because supermarkets won't carry it, Auerbach said.
 Bluefin fishing is highly regulated. Every single fish caught has to be tagged, weighed and reported to the federal government, which goes toward weight quotas for the year. Unlike haddock or lobsters that can be sold directly off the boat to consumers, bluefin tuna require special handling from the time they get onto the boat until they are cut up, Schalit said.
 "Consumers are going to eat it raw, so that sets us completely apart from these other fishermen," he said. "It's chilled down as quickly as possible. It's a very complex process, that's what sets us apart, is the use of the fish, how it's consumed. You can kill a lot of bacteria by cooking a fish, but we have to be very mindful of bacteria and the way its handled to eliminate that problem."
 Hesse said there is more than enough tuna out there for him. Unlike rod and reel fishermen, limited to one tuna a day by federal regulations, Hesse is limited to what he can store in his boat, and to what limits the dealers put on his catch.
 "The good news is the fishery has undergone a resurgence in the last five to six years," he said. "I've been doing this for 35 years and two of my best years have been in the last three. There are a lot of fish around."
 Ares said he is hopeful that demand will increase as more restaurants open and coastal tourism increases.
 "I'm excited, that's why I'm rigging up," he said. "When a buyer says they will pick up the fish, then it's go time."
