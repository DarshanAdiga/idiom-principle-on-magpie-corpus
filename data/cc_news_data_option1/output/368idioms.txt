Report: Bolton says Trump tied Ukraine funds to Biden probe
 The Russian contributor is now acknowledging that he was the point man in the shakedown of the Ukrainian government, working with Rudy Giuliani for President Donald Trump to hold back funding approved by Congress for Ukraine’s defense.
 Parnas needs to be called as a witness to validate his accusations or have the Senate dismiss them.
 I ask that the Senate approve a motion that supports calling witnesses and demands the release of documents that will get to the truth of the matter.
 After watching this solemn initiation and the oath taken, I cannot see how anyone would not want to call witnesses and require the release of documents to prove the case for or against the president.
 This is beyond politics and requires that the information presented either exonerate the president so we can move on, or, based on facts and evidence, the senators can uphold their responsibilities and the oath they took in protecting the Constitution.
 I trust they will do the right thing wherever the facts take us. If witnesses are not called and documents not released, any outcome will be overshadowed by the process. Depending on what side you are on, you may never accept the findings.

Calciomercato, Politano dice sì al Napoli. Intesa con l'Inter, nell'affare anche Llorente
   *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

U.S. stocks fell sharply Monday, slicing more than 450 off the Dow Jones Industrial Average, as investors grappled with fresh worries about the spread of a new virus in China that threatens global economic growth.
 The sell-off gave the Dow its first 5-day losing streak since early August and handed the S&P 500 its worst day since early October. Both indexes were off about 1.5 percent, giving up a significant portion of their gains this month.
 The latest bout of selling on Wall Street came after China announced a sharp rise in cases of the virus.
 Airlines, resorts and other companies that rely on travel and tourism suffered steep losses. Gold prices rose as did bonds as traders sought refuge in safer holdings. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 1.60 percent, its lowest level since October. The market's broad slide followed a sell-off in markets in Europe and Japan.
 "Over the weekend you saw more cases," said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. "That got investors and traders worried that this may be a longer event. The next question is, 'What happens to global growth if this does continue and magnify?'"
 Most markets in Asia were closed for the Lunar New Year holiday, but Japan's Nikkei fell 2.03 percent, its biggest decline in five months. European markets also slumped.
 Chinese health authorities have confirmed 2,750 cases of the virus along with 81 related deaths as authorities extended a week-long public holiday by an extra three days as a precaution against having the virus spread still further. The virus has spread to a dozen countries, including the U.S. Besides the threat to people's lives and health, investors are worried about how much damage the virus will do to profits for companies around the world.
 Even if they're thousands of miles away from Wuhan, the interconnected global economy means U.S. companies have plenty of customers and suppliers in China. It's the world's second-largest economy, and it accounts for 6 percent of all revenue for S&P 500 companies over the last 12 months. That's nearly double any other country besides the United States, according to FactSet.
 "Markets hate uncertainty, and the coronavirus is the ultimate uncertainty in that no one knows how badly it will impact the global economy," said Alec Young, managing director of global markets research at FTSE Russell.
 Resort operators were among the biggest losers in the S&P 500. Wynn Resorts led all company's in the index lower with an 8.1 percent tumble, while Las Vegas Sands dropped 6.7 percent. The companies get most of their revenue from the Chinese gambling haven of Macao.
 American Airlines lost 5.5 percent and Delta dropped 3.4 percent as part of a broad slide for airlines because of concerns international travel will decline amid the virus' spread.
 Booking companies like Expedia and cruise-line operators inlcuding Carnival also got hurt. Expedia Group fell 2.7% and Carnival slid 4.7%.
 Chinese companies that trade shares in the U.S. also declined.
 The technology sector, the biggest in the S&P 500, also saw heavy selling. Apple, which relies on China for supplies and sales, fell 2.9 percent.
 Financial stocks also took steep losses, and the energy sector fell broadly as U.S. oil prices fell 1.9% on worries about reduced demand from China.
 Utilities, real estate stocks and household goods makers held up better than the rest of the market, though they still finished in the red. The sectors are viewed as less-risky and are not as affected by international issues and developments.
 A few companies managed to climb against the sliding markets. Bleach and cleaning products maker Clorox rose 1.1 percent. Small biotechnology companies and drug developers made some of the biggest gains.
 "If you look at this right now, investors and traders are looking at pockets of opportunity," Krosby said. "It's not a question of if, but when they start buying."
 Investors are also dealing with a heavy week of corporate earnings. Apple will report financial results on Tuesday. Pharmaceutical giant Pfizer and Starbucks will also report.
 Boeing, McDonald's, Coca-Cola and Amazon are also among some of the biggest names reporting earnings throughout the week that includes 147 S&P 500 companies.

During the heyday of the old Boston Celtics, the smell of cigar smoke and the sight of Red Auerbach lighting a stogie from his seat on the bench was a sure sign the game was over for whoever was playing against Boston that night.
 There is no smoking in the WVU Coliseum these days, but the No. 12 Mountaineers have their own version of Auerbach’s victory cigar — a 5-foot-11 walk-on freshman from Fort Thomas, Kentucky.
 Make no mistake, Spencer Macke is more than just a glorified mascot for this West Virginia team. As a high school senior, Macke led the state of Kentucky in scoring — 34.9 points per game — and rebounding at 15.8 per game. He found his way to Morgantown via a connection his mother Tricia, a news anchor and youth basketball coach in the Cincinnati area, had with Bob Huggins.
 As WVU’s roster is currently constructed, Macke is going to be one of the last players off the bench, if he even gets into the game. Ask anyone around the program, however, and they will tell you — the kid can play.
 WVU has made a habit of blowing teams out in the Coliseum in recent weeks, and when the fans can sense the game getting out of hand the chants start to echo throughout the building.
 “MACK-KEE” “MACK-KEE”: When Macke gets up from his spot on the bench and approaches the scorer’s table, the arena erupts. The crowd — and the WVU bench — holds its breath every time Macke hoists a shot, and when he starts making shots? Better bring your ear plugs.
 That was the case last week when Macke nailed a 3-pointer — the first basket of his collegiate career — late in a rout of Texas. The Coliseum crowd went crazy. So did the West Virginia bench.
 After the game his teammates carried Macke off the floor on their shoulders, and highlights of his basket literally went around the world as ESPN anchor Scott Van Pelt highlighted the play in his “Best Thing I Saw Today” segment on SportsCenter that night.
 “All walk-ons are popular,” Huggins said. “All those students out there sitting (in the stands), that’s their dream.”
 Saturday, when West Virginia was busy stomping visiting Missouri during their Big 12/SEC Challenge game in Morgantown, a similar scene played out. The Mountaineers were ahead by a wide margin, Macke made his way to the scorer’s table late in the second half and the crowd went wild.
 If the Tigers’ spirits were not yet broken that day, the sight of WVU’s victory cigar checking into the game and the reaction from the Coliseum crowd had to be the final nail in that coffin.
 “Honestly I’ve never seen a walk-on as popular as Spence,” WVU senior Jermaine Haley, a starter for the Mountaineers who last season hit a game-winner against Kansas in the Coliseum, said. “This guy walks around — more people know him than they know me. I know he loves it, and we love him.
 “When he gets in the game, we did our job,” he continued. “That’s really what we work towards the whole game, to make sure we get Spence in the game. We know if we can get Spence in the game then we did exactly what we had to do.”
 Once he was in the game against Missouri, it was clear the mission was to get Macke another bucket. When he hit a 3-pointer, this one from the left side with a kiss off the backboard on its way through the hoop, you would have thought West Virginia had just won a championship from the crowd reaction. When a later attempt appeared like it was going to fall before missing the target, all anyone could do was shrug and smile.

(AP) – President Donald Trump is set to unveil his administration’s much-anticipated Middle East peace plan in the latest American venture to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Odds of it taking shape appear long, given the Palestinians’ preemptive rejection of the plan and Trump’s and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s shaky political standings. Trump is expected to present the proposal alongside Netanyahu at noon Tuesday in Washington. President Trump is set to unveil what he calls a peace plan between the Israelis and the Palestinians.It comes the day Trump’s impeachment trial continues in the Senate and the Israeli parliament planned a hearing to discuss Netanyahu’s request for immunity from criminal corruption charges. Netanyahu withdrew that request Tuesday, saying he had “decided not to let this dirty game continue."Copyright 2020 Associated Press. All rights reserved.
