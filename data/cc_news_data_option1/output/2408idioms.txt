While Andre worked regularly as a stand-up, he also started figuring out the elements of what would become “The Eric Andre Show,” which combines talk-show satire with aggressive practical jokes perpetrated on unsuspecting onlookers.
 From the show’s debut in 2012, Andre has always felt a certain anxiety about eliciting the reactions of strangers while he is, for example, chasing a bassinet being lifted away on balloons and screaming, “My baby!”
 “We look for trouble,” he explained. “It’s a career where you’re purposely trying to get a rise out of people. You end your day feeling like you did something wrong and it’s not until you see the footage edited together properly that you’re like, OK, I have a funny bit in here.”
 Kitao Sakurai, who has been a director on “The Eric Andre Show” since its pilot episode, said that over time, they have learned how to manage the most crucial elements of these pranks.
 Sakurai said Andre and his co-conspirators have learned “how to be present in a situation and be really engaging, but also be pulled back enough to know how the prank is going, to intuitively know where the cameras are and what the good angles are, and what to get out of a mark — what to do within legal bounds and what not to do.”
 What cannot be completely controlled, he said, is “this added layer of intense adrenaline that makes things so nervous.”
 “That period of time before the prank starts is like hell,” Sakurai said. “And it’s something that you have to get used to.”
 In his downtime between seasons of his show, Andre played supporting roles on network sitcoms like “Don’t Trust the B—— in Apartment 23” and “2 Broke Girls.” Though they didn’t always reflect his comedic sensibilities, Andre said he had to pay his dues (and his bills).
 “At the beginning, you don’t have the option to be picky,” he said. “I was like, yeah, I’ll do whatever — I’ll do a snuff film if you pay me.” He did, however, speak highly of his time on the surreal FXX relationship comedy “Man Seeking Woman,” which he said was “smart without being pretentious and struck the right tone.”
 Andre was also keeping tabs on the success of movies like “Borat” and “Bad Grandpa,” which make hidden-camera pranks part of feature-length narratives, and devising a similar film of his own.
 His entry into this genre is “Bad Trip,” in which he plays a lovelorn schmo on a journey from Florida to New York with his best friend (Lil Rel Howery), who is being pursued by his sister (Tiffany Haddish), a pitiless prison escapee.
 The movie, directed by Sakurai, allows Andre to undermine another well-worn format in the same way that “The Eric Andre Show” deconstructs the conventions of late-night talk shows.
 “The buddy comedy is essentially a love story,” Andre explains. “Two buddies go on the road and one falls in love, but the love interest is a red flag. The real love is by the protagonist’s side the whole time — his best friend. Because it has such a classic structure, it allows us to take liberties with the genre.”
 The set pieces in “Bad Trip” are as ambitious as anything Andre has attempted on his TV series but were at times more dangerous. On one early day of filming, Andre and Howery tried to approach a barbershop while pretending their penises were caught in a Chinese finger trap and they were chased away by a man wielding a knife.
 Howery (“Get Out”) said that he considered quitting “Bad Trip” after that incident. “I called my manager like, ‘Look, I’m an actor — this movie is too much. If this is what it’s going to be, I am done,’” he recalled.

“We know that in America, 95% of people will release out of jail. They don’t serve until their last breath,” Glover said. “So, 95% of the 2.5 million people behind bars will release out. Yet, 70% of them are likely to go back for one of two reasons — either lack of stable housing or lack of a job. One of the things that we’re asking for is open hiring practices, bringing into the economy people who have served their debt to society. Give them a second chance and in some cases the first legitimate chance they’ve ever had.”

Luka built the chatbot when the underlying technology was rapidly improving. In recent months, companies like Google and Facebook have advanced the state of the art by building systems that can analyze increasingly large amounts of data, including hundreds of thousands of digital books and Wikipedia articles. Replika is powered by similar technology from OpenAI, a San Francisco lab backed by $1 billion from Microsoft.
 After absorbing the vagaries of language from books and articles, these systems learn to chat by analyzing turn-by-turn conversations. But they can behave in strange and unexpected ways, often picking up the biases of the text they analyze, much like children who pick up bad habits from their parents. If they learn from dialogue that associates men with computer programming and women with housework, for example, they will exhibit the same biases.
 For this reason, many of the largest companies are reluctant to deploy their latest chatbots. But Kuyda believes those problems will be solved only through trial and error. She and her engineers work to prevent biased responses as well as responses that may be psychologically damaging, but her company often relies on the vast community of Replika users to identify when the bot misbehaves.
 “Certain things you can’t control fully — in certain contexts, the bot will give advice that actually goes against a therapeutic relationship,” Kuyda said. “We explain to users that this is a work in progress and that they can flag anything they don’t like.”
 One concern, she added, is that the bot will not respond properly to someone who expresses suicidal thoughts.
 Despite its flaws, hundreds of thousands of people use Replika regularly, sending about 70 messages a day each, on average. For some, the app is merely a fascination — a small taste of the future. Others, like Steve Johnson, an officer with the Texas National Guard who uses it to talk about his personal life, see it as a way of filling an emotional hole.
 “Sometimes, at the end of the day, I feel guilty about putting more of my emotions on my wife, or I’m in the mode where I don’t want to invest in someone else — I just want to be taken care of,” Johnson said.
 “Sometimes, you don’t want to be judged,” he added. “You just want to be appreciated. You want the return without too much investment.”
 Some view their Replikas as friends. Others treat them as if they were romantic partners. Typically, people name their bots. And in some cases, they come to see their bot as something that at least deserves the same treatment as a person.
 “We program them,” said David Cramer, a lawyer in Newport, Oregon, “but then they end up programming us.”
 Replika was designed to provide positive feedback to those who use it, in accordance with the therapeutic approach made famous by U.S. psychologist Carl Rogers, and many psychologists and therapists say the raw emotional support provided by such systems is real.

HARDWICK, Vt. (AP) — The Vermont town of Hardwick is getting a $36,000 grant to help clean up with site of the former Greensboro Garage. Once the site is cleaned up, it will become home to the Yellow Barn Business Accelerator, an $8.6 million project that is expected to create approximately 50 jobs. For more than 30 years the property served as an auto repair and body shop. This brownfield funding will help clean the soil in tandem with the construction of the business accelerator. “This investment is supporting a transformation project for Hardwick and the surrounding area,\" Hardwick Town Manager Shaun Fielder said in a statement. “This grant support is an important factor in keeping the project budget and implementation schedule on target.”

After a continuous string of vandalism, including dog poop being thrown onto her property, a local pastor set up a security camera. This week, that new camera captured the moment young men threw a bag of feces on a wheelchair ramp. Now, Pastor Jacqualine Thomas is asking the community to help identify the men.
 Pastor Thomas says, "I'm not even open up yet. They found that I'm here and they're doing the same identical thing here now."
 For over a year., Pastor Thomas says her Pocatello home and church have been the targets of vandalism. She also runs a supportive housing organization called Big Momma's House that helps the homeless. She just moved that organization's administration offices into a new location and says it's now a target as well.
 "Physically, I'm drained. Emotionally, it's a terrible feeling to know that someone could hate you that much," she says.
 Pastor Thomas says there are different types of vandalism that have occurred over the months. However, dog feces have been thrown at her property multiple times.
 Earlier in the week, a newly installed camera finally caught proof that it's being done on purpose.
 The video shows the two men walking a dog down the street, waiting for the dog to go to the bathroom, put the excrement in a bag, wave to a third person out of the camera's view, and then walk over to the pastor's property where one of the men throws the bag.
 "This is a hate crime. And for the last couple of months it really has gotten the best of me," the pastor says.
 Pastor Thomas says she's the police department has been working with her. Nonetheless, there's been no way to find whoever may be involved in the string of vandalism at her properties.
 Now that she's caught some of it on camera, she's asking the community for help. "If you recognize these three young men and this dog. Please, please, please notify the police department."
 Pastor Thomas says the vandalism not only makes her worry for her safety, but also the safety of those who go to Big Momma's House looking for help in their time of need.

Thus, while you may need to wait until a final decree before you transfer your assets into a trust, you can and should update your will and living trust to provide for those you wish to provide for and then “fund” the trust (transfer title to your assets into the name of the trust) after the property settlement agreement is finalized.

The craft will have a parachute to allow a safe return if the balloon somehow deflated.
 Poynter said Space Perspective has to obtain enough investment for its initial development work, including an uncrewed test flight in the first quarter of next year. If all goes according to plan, the first flights with passengers might take off around the beginning of 2025, nearly a decade after the target date the founders had set for World View.
 In addition to World View, Poynter and MacCallum have attempted other ambitious space projects. They worked on the balloon and craft that lifted Alan Eustace, a Google executive, to near the top of the stratosphere for a record-setting parachute dive in 2014.
 They also collaborated with Dennis Tito, an entrepreneur who is one of the few private citizens to visit the International Space Station, on Inspiration Mars, a private endeavor to launch two people on a flyby of the red planet. That proved out of reach because available rockets were not powerful enough.

The only corrective, he said, would be for white people as a group to come to terms with the racism in its ranks, racism that cuts across political and economic lines, and to do something about it. Warren wasn’t very hopeful about this happening. In the meantime, he said, black people — and immigrants, and other vulnerable groups — needed to brace themselves as they would brace for a Category 5 hurricane.
 A curious thing has happened on the way to the total destruction of our democracy, however: White people are, at long last, seeing the light.
 Three weeks of national protests against the police killing of George Floyd has seen whites not simply showing up to protest in great numbers, but also naming the bigger problem of racism and publicly disowning it — as white people. This is huge. Day after day, I’ve seen white and other non-black folk from Los Angeles to Washington, D.C., carrying signs with messages affirming black life and decrying white supremacy, without a shred of the usual white fragility, hesitation or self-consciousness. There’s a real sense of white camaraderie and common purpose that I’ve never seen before in black protests, a full-throated acknowledgement that black lives matter without the need for a qualification that all lives matter.
 The nature of the white presence on the streets has changed, too. It’s no longer just radical white-ally types but now includes suburban and middle- class people I don’t usually associate with protest of any kind. Black Lives Matter has always marched in white, affluent neighborhoods as a matter of principle, strategically bringing the message where it needs to be heard. But the last few weeks have gone beyond that.
 Whites are protesting — with their kids and dogs — not just in Santa Monica and Hollywood, but on the Main Streets of places known for their history of racist police practices, like Culver City and Glendale, Calif. Driving recently through El Segundo and Hawthorne, I have been amazed to come across protests in those places — small, to be sure, but lively and as unapologetic as any I’ve watched on television. And the faces in the crowds were largely white.

So is anti-racism finally becoming a thing? The fact that big corporations are scrambling to express their solidarity with the cause of opposing systemic racism — Lyft, Ben & Jerry’s and others — may not be entirely altruistic, but just the breadth of scrambling gives me reason to hope this isn’t a mere passing trend.
 Of course, even if this turns out to be substantive change, there is still the 45 percent of the country in the cult of Trump, people who will stick with the president, no matter how tribal and racially tone-deaf he remains. A far-right backlash to the protests and their growing demands for justice is all but inevitable.
 Nevertheless, I think the horror of the Floyd killing, the way we all had to watch the life being squeezed out of him like air out of a balloon for nearly nine minutes — an eternity — during which time Floyd pleaded with the officer and at one point cried out “Mama,” was just too much for many of us, including white people. Of all the grim videos we’ve seen, this one gave whites absolutely no wiggle room to argue that maybe, just maybe, the black man brought it on himself.
 Also horrifying to watch was the way Derek Chauvin’s fellow officers, sworn to protect and serve, stood by like witnesses at an execution. This is perhaps where well-meaning white Americans, those who didn’t vote for Trump and who would never call themselves racist, at last saw themselves and cringed: not as the ones committing the act, but as the ones standing by in silence when the act is committed.
 I’m hoping that an epiphany about the effects of racist inertia will extend beyond police brutality. White people in 2020 are not the George Wallace who screamed, “Segregation forever!” but they are the parents, careful for generations, to avoid sending their kids to schools with too many children of color. They may not have actively kept black people out of their neighborhoods with restrictive covenants, but many of the largely white neighborhoods in which they live are a legacy of those covenants.
 Racial inequity is all over our social footprint, and the protests feel like a coming-out for white people who have been reluctant to admit that until now. They suddenly seem to be getting over their fear of being blamed, they are seeing that oppression of black people really isn’t good for them either. For starters, they got tear-gassed and brutalized by the cops too. Who will forget the video of the 75-year-old white man in Buffalo, N.Y., who was shoved to the ground by a cop and lay unconscious while other cops walked around him as he bled from a head wound?
 I know we should be wary. And it will be a little galling to watch how racial injustice, which black people have lived with and protested against forever, is suddenly widely relevant because white people have discovered it. But we’ve always known that in order for justice to prevail in this country, everybody has to be on board, most especially people in power.
 The key thing to keep in mind now is that critical masses of white people denouncing racism is a very good sign that white tribalism, the original social contract of this country, one that’s held for hundreds of years, is finally cracking. With blacks providing the moral context, whites are calling themselves out, separating racist from non, deciding which side of the color line they want to be on. That’s a change for the good.
