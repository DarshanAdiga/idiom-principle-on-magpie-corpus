WASHINGTON--Scientists from the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Agricultural Research Service (ARS) have identified a new way to detect the presence of live African Swine Fever Virus (ASFV) that minimizes the need for samples from live animals and provides easier access to veterinary labs that need to diagnose the virus.


   


  "We have identified a cell-line that can be used to isolate and detect the presence of the live virus," said ARS Scientist Dr. Douglas Gladue. "This is a critical breakthrough and a tremendous step for African Swine Fever Virus diagnostics."


   


  There are currently no available vaccines to prevent ASFV, and outbreak control has often relied on quarantining and removing infected or exposed animals. Until now, effectively detecting live ASFV required collecting blood cells from a live donor swine for every diagnostic test, because the cells could only be used once. The new cell line can be continuously replicated and frozen to create cells for future use, reducing the number of live donor animals needed.


   


  The new cell line is also commercially available to veterinary diagnostic labs that traditionally did not have access to swine blood cells needed to test for live ASFV.


   


  Recent outbreaks of ASFV outside the African continent started after a single introduction of ASFV in the Republic of Georgia in 2007. The disease has recently spread to China and south east Asian countries. The current "Georgia" outbreak strain is highly contagious and lethal in domestic pigs. Even though the virus is not currently present in the United States, the U.S. swine industry could suffer substantial economic losses should an outbreak occur.


   


  This research, which is highlighted in this month's issue of Viruses, was funded through an interagency agreement with the Science and Technology Directorate of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Department of Energy and the U.S. Department of Agriculture. A provisional patent application for this research was filed in April 2020 and the technology is now available for license. ARS scientists at the Plum Island Animal Disease Center in Plum Island, N.Y. will continue to perform research and work towards finding tools to control the spread of ASFV in the nation.


   


  The Agricultural Research Service is the U.S. Department of Agriculture's chief scientific in-house research agency. Daily, ARS focuses on solutions to agricultural problems affecting America. Each dollar invested in agricultural research results in $20 of economic impact.

"Early [Tuesday] morning, Isaias was downgraded to a tropical storm with maximum sustained winds of 70 mph," said meteorologist Scot Haney. "It made landfall near the border of North and South Carolina and is now moving in our direction."


  Haney said that even though it's no longer a hurricane, it's still a strong storm that will have an impact on the state.


  "The center of Isaias is expected to pass near or just to the west of the Connecticut/New York border [Tuesday] evening, and it will be moving very fast," he said. "That means the most intense part of the storm will be limited to a 6 to 8 hour window, from 3 p.m. until 11 p.m."


  In terms of what to expect, Haney said showers will increase in intensity as the day continues. Tropical downpours will become likely, which may lead to flash flooding during the afternoon and evening hours.


  "A few strong thunderstorms are possible as well, and they could rotate due to a high level of shear," Haney said. "Therefore, a few tornadoes are possible."


  While a tornado could develop anywhere in the state on Tuesday, the Storm Prediction Center put Fairfield County in its "enhanced risk" category.

For this year’s Breastfeeding Awareness Month, Ohio will adopt the theme “Support Breastfeeding for a Healthier Planet.” This theme focuses on the impact of infant feeding on the environment and climate change and the imperative to protect, promote and support breastfeeding for the health of the planet and its people.


  CDC also states that rates of breastfeeding duration and exclusivity are lower among Black infants than among white infants. Increasing rates of breastfeeding initiation and supporting continuation of breastfeeding among Black women might help reduce disparities in breastfeeding duration. Strategies might include improving peer and family support, access to evidence-based maternity care, and employment support.


  “In light of the financial and life-saving benefits of breastfeeding, all elements of the Wood County community must cooperate and support breastfeeding,” said Jackie Mears, Wood County WIC director. “Ultimately our whole society benefits from having healthier mothers, babies and children when breastfeeding is promoted, protected and supported.”


  Breastfeeding is a personal choice, but communities play a vital role in informing and supporting a mother’s decision to breastfeed her baby. Returning communities back into a breastfeeding supportive culture will take efforts by family, friends, employers, educational institutions, hospitals and businesses.

Prior election laws prohibited Town Clerks from putting early ballots into the voting boxes until the day of the election. The new election laws passed by the legislature this month allow Town Clerks to feed the ballots into the voting tabulator ahead of time. But don’t think for a second that early voting means early results. First, Gemme hasn’t decided if Reading ballots will be fed into the tabulator ahead of time. And even if they are, results won’t be announced until after 8 p.m. on election day.


  Much of what guides Gemme is state law, including how those results are displayed.


  The tapes will be posted as usual on the RMHS Fieldhouse stands, but there will be no groups of eager supporters hovering around each precinct’s results. Only one person at a time will be allowed at the tapes.


  “I’m not going to allow a crowd to gather around the tapes as usual,” said Gemme.


  Like many, Gemme has followed the national talk about mail-in voting, including the opinions of Donald Trump. The president has said on Twitter that mail-in ballots will lead to a rigged election.


  “There is NO WAY (ZERO) that Mail-In Ballots will be anything less than substantially fraudulent,” Trump said in a tweet that had to infuriate more than a few town clerks across the country.


  “I can’t guess what he means by that and I don’t take stuff like that personally because he has a right to say what he wants to say,” said Gemme. “If you weren’t a reporter, I would have a whole lot more to say about this. What I will say is that the election system, no matter how it’s run, especially in the state of Massachusetts, is very secure. It’s not easy for fraud. Just like anything else there are some areas that could be fixed but whether or not it’s done by mail or in-person, there’s very little room for fraud in any way.”


  That doesn’t mean she doesn’t have concerns.


  “My only concern about doing election by mail is the United States Post Office actually making sure the ballots are transported in a timely fashion,” said Gemme. “Just before the pandemic started, I was in the office and looking at a returned ballot that the voter sent out from the April election a year before. We’re getting it back months later. That’s my concern about doing mail-in elections. That ballot didn’t count and that’s not fair to the voter.”


  This year’s voter will also be asked to decide the fate of current Select Board member Vanessa Alvarado, the subject of the recall election. The ballot will have two questions. The first is, are you for or against recalling Alvarado? The second is, if Question No. 1 creates a vacancy, who would you like to fill that seat? With John Halsey the only person on the ballot, the recall question as detailed in the town charter could turn into nothing more than a popularity contest between Alvarado and Halsey.


  “I guess you could look at it that way,” said Gemme.


  Regardless, town clerks don’t take sides. Gemme supports a well-run election with the emphasis on safety for all. That would make for a very happy anniversary.

This election season, with the health pandemic rewriting the rules for almost everything, elections will be different as voters decide how to cast their ballots. How different for Gemme, is hard to tell as July winds down.


  “I really can’t answer that until after Sept. 1 but I can say I don’t think it’s going to make much of a difference. There is slightly more work, because the applications have to be processed. There’s slightly more paperwork to it,” said Gemme. “But once the process gets put into place and there’s a routine, I don’t think it’s going to make much of a difference. I think it’s going to be much easier on election day simply because of the pandemic and having less staff.”


  Born in Hartford, Conn., Gemme has lived in Connecticut, New York, Florida, and now Massachusetts. She went to high school in Fort Myers, Fla., and graduated from Tampa College in 1993, where she studied accounting and computers. Town Clerk is a swiss-army-knife-like position with many different duties including elections.


  She’s also the town’s Justice of the Peace. And, she’s been busy.


  “I probably average at least one [wedding] a month. Since Covid’s been going on I’ve done quite a few more. People that had big weddings planned, they got canceled and they still wanted to get married on that same day. Instead of postponing their wedding for a year they just have the ceremony with me and then the big party a year later. I’ve done quite a few that way.”


  Has it been fun?


  “It’s actually one of the better parts of my job. It also depends. It’s fun because they want to get married and they like each other. And then some couples it’s like, are you people sure you’re doing the right thing? But it’s fun.”


  It will be more challenge than fun as the first day of early voting at the Public Library approaches on Aug. 22. If many of Reading’s roughly 20,000 the voters chose either early voting or mail-in voting it will create more work for Gemme and her team. But it also will create a much safer environment for everyone.


  “To me, safety means more than anything,” said Gemme. “From a safety perspective, the less people we have in the field house on election day the better. I would rather have to deal with the extra paper work with a mail-in ballot than have people expose themselves unnecessarily.”

  “All the bins at our disposal are being utilized at our 12 different sites,” Smith said. “This was not an overnight decision. We had had multiple talks with those affected by the issue, trying to come up with alternative, cost- effective solutions. Perrysburg Township ultimately made the decision that this would be the solution that would work best for their site, and we supported that decision.”


  She does not see the program coming back in the near future.


  “We’ve had a significant increase in volume of recycling coming into all of our sites, due to stay-at-home orders and people being home more, getting more deliveries, more cardboard especially, and we’ve also seen rising costs for recycling programs, across the board. So this is not county specific. I think the surrounding counties are seeing the same we are,” Smith said.


  The City of Perrysburg has recently eliminated cardboard recycling programs, which Smith said added to the problem in Perrysburg Township.


  The Perrysburg Township site has had many months with overflowing containers, primarily due to the high volume of cardboard, uncollapsed boxes and commercial use of the residential program.


  There has been a drop in price for the fiber goods recently, but the county does not operate the program on a profit based model, Smith said.

As Ellen DeGeneres finds herself in the midst of controversy following accusations that she has created a toxic workplace, _Ellen DeGeneres Show_ staff have reportedly dubbed her "Talk Show Karen." The unfavorable nickname, a term used to describe an entitled or demanding white woman, is allegedly being used by staffers as they discuss the current controversy.


  DeGeneres' nickname was revealed by production sources. Speaking to the _Daily Mail_, one source poised the question, "Who would've thought that one of America's most loved personalities would morph into America's most famous Karen?" That same source said that staffers are hoping that DeGeneres is outed as host, as "there's no way anyone on staff wants Karen and her band of toxic executives to return."


  Although rumors have swirled for months now that DeGeneres was perhaps not as friendly as she appears on her talk show, they came to a head in July when one current and 10 former employees of the talk show claimed there was a "toxic" work environment behind the scenes. The staffers said they faced intimidation, and racism from upper management during their time at the show. In a subsequent report, other staffers alleged they faced sexual harassment and misconduct from executive producers, accusing executive producers Ed Glavin, Mary Connelly and Andy Lassner, of "bullying."


  The accusations prompted WarnerMedia to officially launch an investigation. In a statement last week, WarnerBros. said that in the initial stages of the investigation, dozens of former and current employees had been interviewed, and that the network was "disappointed that the primary findings of the investigation indicated some deficiencies related to the show's day-to-day management." As a result, the media company added that several "staffing changes" and other "appropriate measures" will be made to "address the issues that have been raised."


  In the midst of the controversy, several reports have suggested that _The Ellen DeGeneres Show_ is on its way out, at least in its current form, with producers reportedly searching for a replacement host. Although some sources have claimed that such rumors are unfounded, and DeGeneres has not publicly commented on the possible fate of her talk show, an insider from Telepictures, the production company behind The Ellen DeGeneres Show, said that big names like Sean Hayes, Kristen Bell, Melissa McCarthy and "the ultimate A-lister" Jennifer Aniston are currently being eyed as a replacement. The source said that "they are all genuinely warm and could carry an Ellen-less show."

The staff at the Cape May County Park and Zoo are preparing for the onset of TS Isaias and have not closed the Parks and Zoo at this time, officials said. The staff is following all safety protocols and storm procedures to ensure the safety of the animals.


  Check the zoo's website at www.cmczoo.com and the county government website at www.capemaycountynj.gov for storm information and additional closings and cancelations.


  Freeholder Director Gerald M. Thornton advised all residents and visitors to take this storm warning seriously and follow safety guidelines in preparing for and during the storm.


  “Remove or secure outdoor furniture and other items that can blow away from the high winds associated with a tropical storm and hurricane,” officials said. “Stay indoors during the storm and if you must go out, avoid flood-prone areas for your safety and the safety of First Responders. Everyone is advised to follow posted notices at all beaches, and U.S. Coast Guard restrictions on boating during this storm. “


  —


  South Jersey is bracing for impact Tuesday morning as Tropical Storm Isaias is expected to bring heavy rains, dangerous rip currents and roadway flooding.


  Gov. Phil Murphy is scheduled to hold a briefing at 10 a.m. about the storm.


  It will be livestreamed here.


  Isaias was downgraded from a hurricane to a tropical storm Monday after making landfall near Ocean Isle Beach, North Carolina, according to an official with the National Hurricane Center.


  The hurricane had touched down just after 11 p.m. on Monday with maximum sustained winds of 85 mph (136 km/h). The storm now has maximum sustained winds of 70 miles per hour (117 km/h).


  “Now that the center has moved further inland into east North Carolina, the winds are now coming back down, so it has been downgraded back to a tropical storm,” Robbie Berg, a hurricane specialist with the National Hurricane Center, told The Associated Press.


  The weather service also said in its 4 a.m. advisory that threats of tornadoes were beginning to spread into southeastern Virginia.


  The storm set off flooding and sparked five home fires in Ocean Isle Beach, Debbie Smith, the town’s Mayor, told WECT-TV. Firefighters from the town’s fire department were battling the blaze with assistance from Horry County firefighters in South Carolina, Tony Casey, a spokesperson for Horry County Fire Rescue, told The Associated Press.


  About 80 miles (128 kilometers) north of Ocean Isle Beach, about 30 people were displaced due to a fire at a condominium complex in Surf City, news outlets reported. It is not clear if the fires were connected to the storm. No injuries have been reported.

This has afforded them the creative freedom to cross the line as they please. No topic is off limits: Gun control, abortion, pedophilia, incest, prostitution, Nazi memorabilia and cannibalism have all got the Sunny treatment. The Gangs ignorance, wilful or not, acts as a flippant counterpoint, undercutting the inherent seriousness of these topics. Even though the treatment isnt moralistic, it doesnt justify or excuse their behaviour. Through irreverence, Sunny demystifies these topics and puts the viewer at a distance. Irreverence defines these topics as any other situation in a sitcom to be analysed and satirised before identifying its contrarian viewpoints.

According to the complaint filed by the victim, she is 20 years old who used to work as a teacher in a computer center. She met Anwar, who lives in Prem Nagar phase 2, in January 2019 in the computer center. He described himself as a Hindu and befriended her. They used to go out together, and in March, he took her to his room. He gave her a cold drink, and as soon as she drank it, she lost her consciousness. After that, the accused allegedly raped her. He also made a video of her. When she woke up and started crying, he promised that he would marry her. He continued to rape her on the pretext that he will post her video on social media. Later he refused to marry her, but when the victim threatened to file a police complaint, he took her to a temple and got married to her after changing his religion. That was the time when the victim came to know about Anwar’s real identity.
