Un 22enne residente a Rottofreno è salito sul pullman della linea Borgonovo- Carpaneto senza la mascherina. L’autista ha invitato il giovane di origini albanesi a indossare il dispositivo di protezione obbligatorio sui mezzi pubblici ma lui ha rifiutato, ha sputato a terra e ha acceso una sigaretta. L’autista ha quindi richiesto l’intervento delle forze dell’ordine. Sul posto sono arrivati gli uomini della Polizia locale dell’Unione bassa Val Trebbia e Val Luretta e i carabinieri. Il giovane si è scagliato contro i militari colpendoli con calci e pugni e procurando una prognosi di cinque giorni. Il 22enne incensurato è stato arrestato con le accuse di resistenza, lesioni, rifiuto di fornire le proprie generalità, interruzione di pubblico servizio in quanto il pullman è rimasto bloccato mezz’ora e anche per il porto abusivo di un cavatappi con uncino di cui non ha saputo giustificare il possesso. Difeso dall’avvocato Mauro Pontini, il giovane nel processo per direttissima in tribunale ha patteggiato 10 mesi, pena sospesa.

And who are the naysayers? Most of them are critics of Donald Trump who are stubborn in giving the president any credit. Trump is certainly not my favorite president. But give the devil his due: Forging a peace deal between Israel and the UAE is a legitimate accomplishment. Skillful was the administration's seizure of the common ground shared by Israel and the UAE (concern over Iran's aggressive designs on the region) and forcing this common ground to translate into a peace agreement.
 Most detractors argue the agreement between Israel and the UAE has forsaken the Palestinians. But as a condition of relations with the UAE, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has agreed to temporarily suspend plans to annex portions of the West Bank (which is also known by its biblical name of Judea and Samaria and where a potential Palestinian state will take root).
 Critics object that Netanyahu insists his promise not to annex portions of the West Bank is only temporary. But a temporary agreement is better than no agreement. Moreover, Israel is bound to discover it will benefit much more from establishing relations with its Arab neighbors than to retain portions of the West Bank, thereby leading to Israel's eventual relinquishment of all claims to the Palestinian territory.

I was excited to unwrap Samsung's Galaxy Note 20 Ultra, a supercharged $1,300 flagship phone that gives the Galaxy Note 10 line a significant upgrade, for a price. But in some ways, I've anticipated the standard, cheaper Galaxy Note 20 even more. Positioned as the entry level Note phone this year, the $1,000 device has some major differences that could matter and a hefty price tag of its own, despite scaled-down specs that encompass screen quality, camera tech and build material all the way to storage and RAM (scroll to the end for the full specs comparison).
 I've now spent over a full day with the Note 20 and I have some observations to share. It takes a good week to thoroughly test a phone, so I'll keep updating this post as new observations develop. Just keep in mind that my opinion might change as the experience all comes together -- and that's a good thing. Getting to know a device takes time and the experience out of the box may settle as a person uses it in day-to-day activities. Ready for the first of my first impressions? Here we go.

Palestinian leadership is especially critical of the new Israel-UAE relationship. Concern has been expressed that the more Arab nations establish relations with Israel, the weaker the prospects become for the birth of a Palestinian state. Just the opposite is true. And the fact that peace is seen by the Palestinian leadership as a threat is telling. In reality, Israel is not the enemy of the Palestinian leadership. Peace itself is the enemy of the Palestinian leadership.
 Somewhat of a wild card in the current developments in Middle East politics is the kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Like the other Arab nations already mentioned, Saudi Arabia conducts thinly veiled relations with Israel (also based on the mutual concern over Iran). Saudi Arabia has been reluctant to establish public and formal relations with Israel because it sees itself as the guarantor of Palestinian interests and fears Iran taking over this role in the wake of peace with Israel.
 But if the aforementioned Arab nations follow suit with the UAE, Saudi Arabia will have enough cover to build on its overtures to the Jewish state. And speaking of Palestinian interests, far more valuable to Israel is a potential agreement with Saudi Arabia than a claim to the West Bank, thereby enhancing the potential of a Palestinian state.
 Speaking of a Palestinian state, another wild card in this mixture of Middle East politics is the Gaza Strip, now under the control of the terrorist organization known as Hamas. Gaza has been considered part of the Palestinian equation ever since the Oslo Accords of 1994. But it is more practical for the Palestinians to relinquish claims to Gaza. Not only is Gaza under control of Hamas and not only does it lack geographic continuity with the West Bank, but the inhabitants of Gaza aren't true Palestinians. They are Egyptian in background and have made clear their disinterest in peace with Israel.
 In the meantime, we will soon be witness to Israel and the UAE formalizing relations. If peace counts for anything, this is a great event. And the naysayers should look at the overwhelming benefits to such an accord, notwithstanding the credit President Trump might reap.

For all the bulbous faults of its protruding camera array, the Note 20 Ultra's enhanced photography got me closer to nature than the Note 20 and, after a while, I stopped reaching for the Note 20 altogether. Zoom didn't get me as near to the fluffy seals lounging on the rocks and when I did zoom in to the cormorants on the rocks or turkey vultures in the trees, the images looked grainier than on the Note 20 Ultra.
 I could still share the Note 20 pictures and videos with my birder and nature- loving friend -- who I knew would flip for them regardless -- and the photos are still effective and usable. But side by side, it's obvious where Samsung made its investments.

The plastic backing matters, but maybe not how you expect
 One of the major -- and very obvious -- differences between the Note 20 Ultra and standard Note 20 is the backing. You get a Gorilla Glass Victus cover material on the back of the Note 20 Ultra and a polycarbonate (that means plastic) backing on the Note 20. This may not seem like a big deal, but Samsung and other high-end smartphone makers are perhaps victims of their own success, training consumers that glass is classy and sophisticated, while plastic, a typically less shatter-prone material, is less refined.

His concentration lapsed, he forgot to keep two hands on the ball and a defender was there to knock it away. Jones has gotten stronger, adding nearly 10 pounds of muscle, and that should help. He has big hands, which should also help. The key here is Jones increasing his pocket awareness, and that comes with experience, knowing, or at least sensing, where the pressure is coming from. He is a sharp guy, and he knows this failing held him back as a rookie.
