Dr. Marshall, for many of us (myself included), your podcasts have been a source of enlightenment, entertainment, and--quite frankly--hope, during this very dark time in the history of the Church. As someone who studied his way into the Catholic Faith, having the grace and the integrity to acknowledge the necessity of conversion from the Protestant sect to which you formerly belonged, you have not been content to rest on your laurels but have "put yourself out there," launching the New Saint Thomas Institute and discussing current events _sub luce aeternitatis._ Your willingness to deal with things the way they are, and not the way they would be if we were all painted on holy cards already, is refreshing and appreciated.

His injury history has been the biggest knock on Clowney. He's played a full 16-game schedule only once in six seasons -- in 2017 with Vrabel as his coordinator.

Sir Frank stopped coming to races a few years ago because of health problems but the Italian Grand Prix was a sad affair as it was announced that the Williams Family will no longer be involved in the running of the team that bears the name.
 The existing directors of Williams Grand Prix Engineering (WGPE) have all resigned and a new board has been named with three directors: American citizens Matthew Savage and Darren Fultz and Britain's James Matthews, a wealthy hedge fund owner. The control of the business has passed to a Bermuda called BCE Ltd, which was registered in August 2019. This means that Frank Williams is no longer an F1 team owner.
 WGPE was established back in February 1977, although prior to that Frank owned Frank Williams Racing Cars Ltd, which was first involved in F1 in 1969 when he ran a Brabham for Piers Courage. Thus Williams was an F1 team principal for 51 years, a record that will be almost impossible to beat. In that period the team won 114 World Championship race victories and collected nine Constructors' titles and seven Drivers' championships.

“There are many firsts in this launch. The spacecraft is new, the launch method is also different. That’s why we need to make sure there is extra security,” the military source said.
 The Post, citing Xinhua, reported that during its two-day flight, the spacecraft would test reusable technologies with the aim of “providing technological support for the peaceful use of space.”
 And although details of the mission were scarce, the Chinese military source told the Post that it should “take a look at the US X-37B,” a reference to the U.S. Department of Defence’s top-secret space plane developed by Boeing. According to the U.S. Air Force, the X-37B is an experimental test program that aims to demonstrate “reusable spacecraft technologies for America’s future in space and operating experiments, which can be returned to, and examined, on Earth.”
 The X-37B is a reusable vehicle that doesn’t require an onboard crew. It enters space on top of a rocket, stays in low Earth orbit and then re-enters the atmosphere. It even lands like a normal plane.
 Could this mean that China’s developed its own version of the X-37B? Perhaps. We won’t exactly know unless someone decides to spill the beans. Until then, we can only hope the “peaceful use of space” affirmation was sincere. It’s 2020. The last thing we need is space drama.

Drones are increasingly autonomous. Drone vision defines the contemporary aesthetic of war, but it is also increasingly present in new modes of art, activism, and popular and promotional culture.
 Images of conflict are now often seen through the eyes of Predator and Reaper drones, which can make witnessing war difficult if not impossible. Police drones can capture footage of protests and be used in the court room against activists.
 Yet at the same time, drone vision can allow us to witness state violence that might otherwise have gone undetected and even reveal the invisible data systems that police airspace.
 Drone footage of open cut mines, Great Barrier Reef bleaching and the newly intense devastation of bushfires, floods and droughts make the effects of the climate emergency inescapable.
 As Black Lives Matter protests continue across America and the world, drones bear witness to clashes between police and activists, democratising the aerial view that once belonged to police and media helicopters.
 ## A brief history of drones
 Before drones, the view from above was limited to helicopters, satellites, air planes and, further back still, the hot air balloon. Drones have made the aerial view commonplace, found everywhere from news reports to geographic surveys to wedding photos.

In the ritualized world of diplomatic jargon, this moment signaled not only a new European tone but also a new direction.

Curtin University’s Professor Steven Tingay, who co-authored the study with Dr Tremblay, conceded the result was largely expected, despite being one of the biggest observations ever undertaken.
 “Even though this was a really big study, the amount of space we looked at was the equivalent of trying to find something in the Earth’s oceans but only searching a volume of water equivalent to a large backyard swimming pool,” Professor Tingay said.
 “Since we can’t really assume how possible alien civilisations might utilise technology, we need to search in many different ways. Using radio telescopes, we can explore an eight-dimensional search space.
 “Although there is a long way to go in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence, telescopes such as the MWA will continue to push the limits—we have to keep looking.”
 For now, the quest for uncovering alien life continues.
