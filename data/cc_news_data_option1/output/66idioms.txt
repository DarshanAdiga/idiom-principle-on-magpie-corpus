A teenager recorded on a dashcam speeding through the streets before crashing into a taxi has been given a suspended sentence and driving ban.
 Sean Grindle, who only had a provisional driving licence, drove at speeds of up to 75mph in built up areas, went the wrong way down a one-way street and drove through a red light in June last year, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said.
 The 18-year-old from Bootle was given a 10-month suspended sentence and banned from driving for two years, at Liverpool Crown Court. He had admitted dangerous driving, driving without a licence and without insurance.
 Senior district crown prosecutor Geoffrey Fryar said: "Dashcam footage showed the dreadful collision at the end of this extremely dangerous driving and it clearly is a miracle that no-one was seriously injured.
 "Grindle's recklessness is almost beyond belief. The Crown Prosecution Service would like to thank Merseyside Police and the witnesses in this case for their help in bringing this reckless teenager to justice."

“In the long run,” he later added, “this isn’t just going to save our college money; it’s going to save our local environment and our water table.”
 The Pump Pod DRAFTS Unit will be utilized primarily for hose training, in which cadets learn how to handle the high-powered hoses used in fighting fires. Lines can be connected from the mobile pod unit directly to a fire engine, much the same way that a real-word engine would connect to a fire hydrant.

There have been other personnel changes, of course, and not all of them have been good. The Chiefs lost defensive end Alex Okafor to a torn pectoral muscle late in the season, and rookie safety Juan Thornhill had his dynamic debut season cut short when he tore his ACL in a Week 17 win over the Chargers that helped the Chiefs earn the No. 2 seed in the AFC playoffs.

LONDON] European companies are limbering up for a Japanese-style foreign takeover binge. A shrinking domestic market and super-low borrowing costs spurred firms in Asia's second-largest economy to pursue ever-bigger overseas targets. Now their European Union (EU) counterparts, facing similar challenges at home, are poised to follow suit. Expect the likes of Germany's Siemens, Italy's Eni and banks such as BNP Paribas and ING to push further into faster- growing markets as 2020 kicks off.

“The last place we want them is on the street,” Weaver said. “We want them in a safe place.”
 Weaver said he’s not sure how many local youths might be expected to avail themselves of the Safe Place during a time of crisis.
 “We’re a little bit nervous in that it's unknown,” he said. “The city has responded to quite a few runaway youth calls but that doesn’t mean those youths will actually call somebody. So we really don’t know if this is going to be utilized or just something out there that maybe every once in a while somebody uses.

Protests were held in many Indian cities after masked goons attacked students and teachers at Delhi's prestigious Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) on Sunday night, leaving many injured. The RSS's student wing, Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP), is being widely blamed for the horrific attack, but it denies involvement and points the finger instead at alleged violence by Left student groups. The Delhi Police has come under fire for doing little to control the assailants, and one viral video shows a large group of young, armed men walking coolly down a street with impunity. Stay tuned to this live blog for the latest updates on the ongoing investigation of the JNU violence, political reactions, and protests taking place across India.
