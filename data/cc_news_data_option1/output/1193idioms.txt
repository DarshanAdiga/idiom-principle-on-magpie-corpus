Technical chart claims that Capstead Mortgage Corporation (CMO) would settle between $3.54/share to $3.75/share level. However, if the stock price goes below the $3.06 mark, then the market for Capstead Mortgage Corporation becomes much weaker. If that happens, the stock price might even plunge as low as $2.78 for its downside target. The stock is currently in the red zone of MACD, with the indicator reading -0.46. Traders are always alerted for the move of a stock above or below the zero line due to the fact that the reading is an indicator of the position of the short-term average relative to the long-term average. If the MACD is above the zero line, then the short-term average relative is above that of the long-term average, thus implying an upward momentum. Vice versa is the case if the MACD is below the zero line.

If the Olympics were held in spring, the marathon could move back to Tokyo and there wouldn’t be any worries about the humidity affecting any of the athletes competing in outdoor venues. And the cooler temperatures would make things more pleasant for the more than 1 million fans expected to attend.
 Still, the idea of staging the Olympics in the spring comes with plenty of drawbacks.
 “Think about all the sports you would be competing against at that time of year,” said Michael Phelps, who retired after 2016 Rio Games as the most decorated athlete in Olympic history. “You have these gung-ho Olympic fans who want to watch the game in the summer. What if ratings plummet because of a change they make?”
 A spring Olympics would compete for U.S. television viewers against not only baseball, which would have just opened its season, but the NHL and NBA playoffs. Also, many major domestic soccer leagues around the world would be in the homestretch of their seasons.
 The sport that would be hurt the most by a spring Olympics is basketball. Most NBA players would not be able to compete (except, perhaps, those whose teams didn’t make the playoffs) and it would be a short turnaround from March Madness for many of the top men’s and women’s college players.
 When taking the athletes’ needs into consideration — which, of course, should be the primary goal though it rarely is — Phelps believes the games should be rescheduled for the summer of 2021.
 “I think that’s best way to do it,” he said. “Then the athletes actually have a full year to go back to the drawing board, figure out what they have to do between now and the trials. If you try to do it sooner, you’re almost lost in limbo.”
 Rick Burton, a professor of sports management at Syracuse University, wonders if the Olympics could even be staged safely next spring.

Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden said on Wednesday that potential efforts by President Donald Trump to re-open American businesses in time for the Easter holiday could be "catastrophic."
 The governors of at least 18 states, including New York and California, have issued stay-at-home directives affecting about half the U.S. population, and shuttering many businesses, in a costly effort to slow the deadly pathogen's spread.
 Trump on Tuesday told reporters he would like to see businesses opening their doors again by Easter, which will be celebrated on April 12. "I would love to have the country opened up and just raring to go by Easter," he said on Fox News Channel.
 Biden, the front-runner for the Democratic nomination to face Trump in the November election, said a quick return to normalcy could backfire.
 "Now he's suggesting he wants to get the country back opened by Easter," Biden told reporters on a video conference, warning that it was an arbitrary or symbolic timeline.
 "It would be a catastrophic thing to do for our people and for our economy if we sent people back to work just as we were beginning to see the impact of social distancing take hold only to unleash a second spike in infections," Biden said. "That'd be far more devastating in the long run."
 Biden has been critical of Trump's response to the coronavirus, saying that a delayed effort to scramble tests and medical equipment meant Americans would be hit harder and take longer to recover. On Tuesday, he said on MSNBC that it "would be a real resurrection" to see American businesses re-open by Easter.
 Biden also called on businesses and investors to be guided by "the science of medicine" and "not the science of Wall Street" as they weigh what path is best for the economy.
 Trump and his coronavirus team on March 16 put in place recommendations for people across the country to cut down social and professional interactions for 15 days in a bid to reduce the spread of the coronavirus. Public health experts have said the timing for ending such orders must be flexible and based on medical research.

The market, though strong, is not quite as strong as the Dow makes it look, however. The S&P 500 has risen 4.7% to 2563.20, and the Nasdaq Composite has advanced 3.1% to 7648.01. And there’s an obvious reason for that—Boeing (BA). Shares of the airplane manufacturer have gained 30% to $166.34 on hopes that the rescue package will help it weather the storm. Since the Dow is price weighted, it has gotten a major lift—274 of points of its gain—from the stock. The S&P 500 is market-cap weighted, so has a decent slug of Boeing, but not nearly as much as the Dow. Boeing, which is listed on the New York Stock Exchange, is not in the Nasdaq Composite.
