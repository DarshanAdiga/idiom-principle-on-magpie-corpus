WASHINGTON -- The Republican-controlled U.S. Senate will hear opening arguments in President Donald Trump's impeachment trial on Wednesday, beginning several days of argument on whether to remove Trump from office.
 In Davos, Switzerland, Trump said allowing current and former top administration officials such as John Bolton to testify at the trial would present national security concerns.
 In a 13-hour battle over trial rules that lasted until the wee hours of Wednesday, Republican senators rejected requests for subpoenas seeking the testimony of Bolton, Trump's former national security adviser, and three White House officials.
 That battle is likely to resume next week.
 Trump was impeached last month by the Democratic-run House of Representatives on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress for pressuring Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, a Democratic political rival, and impeding a congressional inquiry into the matter.
 The president denies any wrongdoing.
 The trial, the third presidential impeachment trial in U.S. history, was due to resume at 1 p.m. ET (1800 GMT). On Tuesday - effectively the trial's opening day - Democrats argued that more witnesses and records were needed since the Trump administration had not complied with requests for documents and urged officials not to participate.
 Arguments became so heated that Chief Justice John Roberts, who is presiding over the trial, admonished both the defense and prosecution.
 Representative Adam Schiff, leading the House Democrats' prosecution team of "managers," said the evidence against Trump was "already overwhelming" but further witness testimony was necessary to show the full scope of the misconduct by the president and those around him.
 Trump is almost certain to be acquitted by the Republican-controlled 100-member chamber, where a two-thirds majority is needed to remove him from office. But the trial's effect on Trump's November re-election bid is unclear.
 Trump said he would prefer a longer trial so that current and former top administration officials could testify, but that having them appear would present national security concerns.
 "The problem with John (Bolton) is that it's a national security problem," Trump said at the World Economic Forum in Davos.
 "He knows some of my thoughts, he knows what I think about leaders. What happens if he reveals what I think about a certain leader and it's not very positive?" he told a news conference.
 Republican senators have not ruled out the possibility of further testimony and evidence at some point later in the trial but they held firm with Trump to block Democratic requests for witnesses and evidence.
 "They insist that the president has done nothing wrong, but they refuse to allow the evidence and hearing from the witnesses … and they lie, and lie and lie and lie," Representative Jerrold Nadler, another Democratic impeachment manager, said of Trump's lawyers in remarks to the Senate.
 White House counsel Pat Cipollone fired back.
 "Mr Nadler, you owe an apology to the president of the United States and his family," Cipollone said. "You owe an apology to the Senate. But most of all you owe an apology to the American people."
 REMEMBER WHERE YOU ARE
 That back-and-forth led Roberts, the chief justice of the United States, to admonish both men.
 "I do think those addressing the Senate should remember where they are," he said.
 Republicans could try to call Biden as a witness, an idea Democrats have resisted as a needless distraction.
 During a debate that finally wrapped up near 2 a.m. (0700 GMT) on Wednesday, senators rejected by 53-47 votes motions from leading Senate Democrat Schumer to subpoena records and documents from the White House, the State Department, the Defense Department, and the Office of Management and Budget related to Trump's dealings with Ukraine.
 Senators also rejected requests for subpoenas seeking the testimony of acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, White House aide Robert Blair and White House budget official Michael Duffey.
 Under the rules, lawyers for Trump could move early in the proceedings to ask senators to dismiss all charges, according to a senior Republican leadership aide, a motion that would likely fall short of the support needed to succeed.
 Schumer on Wednesday poured cold water on a report in the Washington Post that Democrats are privately considering a deal under which Biden and his son Hunter would testify in exchange for Bolton testifying.
 Hunter Biden served on the board of a Ukrainian gas company and he is at the heart of unsubstantiated allegations by Trump of corruption in Ukraine.
 The Senate trial is expected to run six days a week, Monday through Saturday, until at least the end of January.
 Trump and his legal team say that there was no pressure on Ukraine and that the Democrats' case is based on hearsay. Cipollone described the Ukraine investigation as an illegal attempt to remove a democratically elected president and avert his re-election.
 No president has ever been removed through impeachment, a mechanism the nation's founders - worried about a monarch on American soil - devised to oust a president for "treason, bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors." One president, Richard Nixon, resigned in the face of a looming impeachment.

“Nothing I do is fashionable,” Nettles tells _Free Times_. “I’m making this music for a small slice of life. It’s not for everybody. I think about it as being one percent of people who are into it, and I just have to reach them. But you make a record and you have to create a marketing campaign and you have to create a video and you have to do all this smoke and mirrors, and I’m just like, ‘I don’t know.’ I’d rather put out music that means something.”
 Pynchon never made things easy on the reader. Nettles takes it easier on the listener. Despite the heady approach, the results are simultaneously thrilling and approachable — brainy and sure, but also humorous and humanist. Consider last year’s _Missing Pieces_ , which resonates with a universal notion: the transience of life, and how we learn to live with the holes left when our loved ones leave this world for the next.
 Though it’s lyricless, _Missing Pieces_ is autobiographical, born out of personal loss. Nettles’ mother died. He was left reeling after a long-term relationship dissolved. Nettles’ grief and isolation were punctuated by the death by suicide of the Athens musician Carl Lindberg, a dear friend and a frequent collaborator.
 To cope — and to move forward — Nettles retreated deeper into his art.
 “I was writing to stay alive, more or less,” Nettles says. “I was trying not to think about anything other than what I was playing at the moment. I kind of put myself to work writing this music. I kind of just made it my job.”

And this renowned storyteller shows no sign of flagging in A Dangerous Man, perhaps one of Crais’ best books yet, as Cole and Pike tackle a case which begins in the most inauspicious of circumstances and snowballs into a tense and electrifying thriller filled with mystery, malevolence and high-octane action.
 Joe Pike didn’t want to run into trouble that day… he was simply going to the bank in Los Angeles to deposit some cash and cheques. Mission accomplished, he returned to his Jeep parked outside and it was at that moment that it all started to go wrong.
 Pike notices ‘details,’ not least because multiple tours with the Marines in hotspots like Central America and Afghanistan had ‘baked in his skills.’ And when he sees Isabel (Izzy) Roland, the 22-year-old teller who has just served him in the bank, step out of the building only to be rapidly bundled into the back of a car by two men, he feels he has no choice but to follow them.
 After chasing the car down, he rescues the terrified Izzy and the men are arrested. But not long after they are released on bail, the men are found dead, each professionally executed with a single gunshot wound to the head… and Izzy is missing.

             China has issued biosafety certificates for some genetically modified (GM) corn and soybeans that grow domestically. This is the first time that domestic GM crops have been issued certificates in a decade, but experts noted it is still far from allowing the commercialization of GM products.      The crops receiving the certificates include the SHZD32-01 soybeans developed by Shanghai Jiao Tong University, DBN9936 corn from Beijing Dabeinong Technology Group and the double-stacked 12-5 corn by Hangzhou Ruifeng Bitech Co, according to a list released by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs.      Jiao Shanwei, editor-in-chief of grain news website cngrain.com said that although the issuance of the certificates signifies a huge step in the research and development of GM crops, there is a long way to go before the government allows commercialization of the products, largely due to public concerns over safety.      "China has a strict set of regulations on GM crops, including imports and those grown domestically," Jiao told the Global Times. "Currently GM soybeans are only allowed for animal feed and oil production, as the GM process affects mostly the soybean meal rather than the oil pressed from it."      The only commercial GM products in China include cotton and papaya, according to a report from news portal thepaper.com. However, commercialization of key GM crops is highly unlikely under the new food strategy, which upholds food safety as the paramount guideline, Jiao said. "It is crucial to engage with and develop the technology of GM products, but I think for a long time we will only see commercialization of non-food GM products such as cotton," Jiao said.

       After protracted trade negotiations, China and the US finally signed the phase one trade deal on January 15. This agreement did not come easily. Both sides went through a 22-month trade battle and 13 rounds of high-level consultations. Although the phase one deal was reached, trade conflicts between the two sides remain unresolved. It is necessary to establish a mechanism for future trade and economy negotiations between China and the US.      Right before signing the deal, the Wall Street Journal claimed that Beijing and Washington have agreed on new semiannual bilateral dialogues, which are intended to "pursue reforms" and "address disputes" in economy and trade. But, this information was neither confirmed nor mentioned in the phase one deal. However, as economic interactions increase and strategic competition intensifies, institutionalizing bilateral negotiations in economy and trade would be a necessity for both countries.      From bilateral trade ties to the global industrial chain, the relationship between China and the US is so close that they are now fully aware completely separating the two countries is unrealistic.      In the meantime, the trade frictions are becoming more obvious. US President Donald Trump constantly finds fault with China in terms of economy, which led to the China-US trade war that has lasted for nearly two years. In order to deal with the differences, leaders, senior officials and negotiating teams from the two countries made plenty of phone calls and flew back and forth across the Pacific. However, even with all these efforts, the negotiations did not go very well. The lack of an institutionalized trade consultation mechanism is likely one of the reasons.      For a troubled relationship like that between China and the US, it is hard to maintain strategic stability without a series of communication mechanisms. As a matter of fact, over 100 dialogue mechanisms have been established between the two countries. For example, in the field of economy and trade, there are several, such as the China-US Strategic and Economic Dialogue (S&ED) and China-US Comprehensive Economic Dialogue (CED). However, not all are effective. After the first round of the CED in July 2017, the dialogue has not been held as scheduled due to the trade war, rendering the CED ineffective. Looking back at the obstacles and hardships the two countries have been through, establishing a regular consultation mechanism is of great importance.      Since the trade issues between China and the US cover many areas and government departments, an institutionalized mechanism will be conducive to reducing the costs. Take the phase one deal as an example. The negotiations covered intellectual property rights, technology transfer, trade in food and agricultural products, expanding trade, bilateral evaluation and dispute resolution. This involves departments related to diplomacy, commerce, finance and agriculture. The time savings stemming from having a trade consultation mechanism with relatively fixed members would be immense.      The new China-US trade consultation mechanism can be formed based on previous history and experience. As trade ties get tighter, strengthening the trade consultation body will be an inevitable outcome, which can also be seen as a product of the complexity of two countries' strategic competition. From the S&ED to the CED, China-US trade negotiations have a long history with much experience to learn from. The biggest difficulty will be how to maintain the running of the trade mechanism if other areas of cooperation were to decline.      While a new mechanism will surely benefit China and the US, it will also have a positive knock-on effect on global trade order and economic governance. China-US relations are one of the most important economic bilateral relations in the world. The development of China-US trade ties is highly connected with global trade order and economic governance. At present, if trade frictions between China and the US cannot be dealt with properly, institutional mechanisms for international trade, such as the WTO, will be affected. An effective China-US trade consultation mechanism will be of significance to the global economy.      Undoubtedly, forming a stable trade consultation mechanism is not going to be easy. Not only will the US shift its approach to China as new administrations are sworn in, personnel adjustments and competition over interests among government departments will negatively impact the consistency of the trade consultation mechanism. Additionally, the mechanism could be impacted by the condition of other fields where China and the US have cooperation. But all in all, China-US relations and their trade ties have entered a crucial point where a trade consultation mechanism will be of great importance in reinforcing communication and understanding.       _The author is secretary-general of the International Security Study Center at China Foreign Affairs University. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn_

Disinvestment in blue chip Bharat Petroleum Corporation (BPCL) is in all surety not happening this year, as also Air India sale. As such, the government is eyeing asset monetisation to make up for less proceeds from disinvestment compared to the projections. The proceeds under this head assumes importance since tax collections are set to fall short of projections by over Rs 2 trillion. Even as the Modi government revived the idea of strategic disinvestment, shelved off after the UPA government replaced the Vajpayee government, not much happened on this front. Though the Modi government did project Rs 28,500 crore from disinvestment in its second Budget in its previous stint, nothing came from it.

It's a similar story with rice exporters who remain on edge, fearing new regulations by Chinese authorities. China is one of the world's largest importers of rice, while India is big exporter. In fact, the staple grain for a majority of Indians remains by far the single largest exported farm commodity, making up $7.7 billion worth of outbound shipments in 2018-19.

It's been awhile since the U.S. market has seen an IPO that originated in China. That happened in 2017 when Shanghai-based Zai Labs Ltd. went public, reaping gross proceeds of about $150 million. A rule change in the spring of 2018 by the Hong Kong Stock Exchange allowed more pre-profit companies to list there, but some saw I-Mab's decision to go the U.S. route as evidence of a shift. Firms such as U.S.-based Grail Inc. and Stealth Bio Therapeutics Inc. made U-turns and listed in the U.S. after considering Hong Kong as an option. I-Mab, for its part, has been otherwise successful at pulling down money since it was formed in 2017 via the merger of Third Venture Biopharma Co. Ltd. and Tasgen Biotech Co. Ltd. The most advanced prospect in the pipeline is TJ-202, a CD38 antibody, licensed from Morphosys AG, of Planegg, Germany. The compound is undergoing two registrational trials, including a third-line monotherapy trial and a second-line combination therapy trial, in multiple myeloma (MM) in greater China. The company submitted an IND application to the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) in October 2019 for a phase Ib trial in systemic lupus erythematosus.

A new trailer for Pokemon: Mewtwo Strikes Back Evolution gives us our first look at the upcoming animated Pokemon film coming to Netflix on February 27, 2020.
 As a CGI remake of the very first Pokemon movie that released back in 1998, Mewtwo Strikes Back Evolution follows the origin story of Mewtwo who's created after researchers discover a way to exploit a fossil of the Mythical Pokemon, Mew. Going against the very rules of nature, Mewtwo is created to be a tool of destruction, but the Pokemon becomes aware of its own origin and wants to seek revenge against its human creators.
 Of course, iconic heroes Ash and Pikachu get caught up in the fray after Mewtwo is created. Some of the franchise's most famous characters also join adventure, with Misty and Brock journeying with Ash along with their classic Pokemon pals. In the trailer we also get to see the villainous Team Rocket duo Jesse and James get up to no good with Meowth in tow.
 Glimpses of some classic scenes from the original movie recreated in CGI form can be seen throughout the trailer to deliver a helping of nostalgia for those who saw the classic movie back in '90's. The remake brings the popular story back to life once again, with an interesting new look for all of the famous characters from the animated series.
 The movie was originally released in Japan last year, and whatever your view on the new CGI look, its arrival on Netflix at least means we'll be able to experience this new take on the classic movie.
  _In other Pokemon-related news,_ _you can watch the first episode of the animated short Twilight Wings, which is based on Pokemon Sword and Shield_ _. _

"You were talking in your sleep last night," I said to my husband when he stumbled into the kitchen that morning. I handed him a cup of Espresso to jolt him out of his coma.      "No, I wasn't," he said.      "How would you know," I said. "You were asleep. I was not asleep … because you were talking in your sleep."      "I don't talk in my sleep," he said as he sat down at the table. The dog came over for a scratch behind the ears or maybe just to take my husband's side.      "Well, you did last night," I said. "And you were very adamant about it."      Now my husband was interested. I'm sure he thought he had perhaps divulged some husband secret from deep within his subconscious, like, the fact that he purposely hangs the toilet paper the wrong way just to make me crazy.      "What did I say?" he wondered.      "Begone," I replied.      "I said 'begone?'" he repeated.      "Yes."      He shook his head. "I would never say 'begone.' I'd say 'Get lost,' but I wouldn't say 'begone.' I think you heard it wrong. Maybe I said, 'poupon.'"      "Were you dreaming about mustard?" I said.      "Unlikely," he admitted. We were both silent as we wondered what had inspired him to yell out "begone" in his sleep. Maybe he had dreamed he was a king's attendant in a Shakespeare play, or a French knight in a Monty Python movie. Perhaps he was a hobbit standing his ground in the Shire, or a constable clearing the cobblestone streets of Old England from lollygaggers. Or maybe he dreamed it was 200 years ago and I was berating him for hanging the toilet paper the wrong way and he yelled at me to "begone."      This wasn't the first time he had talked in his sleep. There was the time he did a musical countdown and conducted an orchestra while he slept, smacking me in the face as he directed the string section. Another time he yelled out, 'Who's there!" and I jumped out of bed and hid in the closet thinking there was an intruder in the house. And one time he told me to bring the camels inside, even though we lived in the suburbs and we weren't zoned for domesticated desert pets.      Sleeping with my husband was not restful, but it was certainly entertaining.      "Did I say anything else," he asked, hoping for some insight into the source of his nocturnal mumblings.      I thought for a moment. He had said some other things but mostly under his breath so I couldn't make them out.      "I don't know," I finally said. "Maybe I dreamed it."      "Probably," he said. "'Cuz I would never say 'begone.'"   "Okay. Anyway, honey, I have to run," I said, putting on my jacket. "I have an appointment. Would you mind taking the dog out?" I thrust the leash at him.      "Fine," he said. "Begone."   You can follow Tracy on Twitter @TracyBeckerman and become a fan on Facebook at www.facebook.com/LostinSuburbiaFanPage.
