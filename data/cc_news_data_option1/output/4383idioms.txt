Power for the Blazer-E comes from a 400-volt Bolt EV battery pack with 60kWh of usable energy installed in the cargo area. The output is about 200 hp and 266 lb-ft of torque, more than the stock '77 Blazer's 175 hp from a 400 cubic- inch gasoline V8. So it's ahead of the game already. Torque is routed through a Chevrolet Performance electronically controlled four-speed automatic and thence to the remaining stock '77 Blazer transfer case, driveshaft, differential and axles.
 New parts include an electric power steering kit, an electric pump to send vacuum pressure to the stock brake system, and an electric controller to drive inputs to the vintage Blazer gauges now showing battery state of charge where the fuel gauge used to be, for instance.
 The packages will be available in the second half of 2021. No word on prices yet.
 "It's too soon to discuss pricing as we have not finalized the components included in the eCrate system," said a Chevy spokesman. "This is a key reason we are surveying SEMA members. Understanding what components they would need for their EV builds will help as we finalize the parts lists for our initial eCrate packages."

“If Black people just act a certain way, [they] would be afforded rights and freedom” is how Angela Lewis-Maddox, a political science professor at the University of Alabama, Birmingham, and author of _Conservatism in the Black Community: To the Right and Misunderstood_ , describes the essence of the Black conservative experience, as articulated by Sowell and others. This is not a new phenomenon, she notes. In 1787, Jupiter Hammon, an enslaved person and a writer, addressed a crowd of enslaved people in New York. “Now I acknowledge that liberty is a great thing, and worth seeking for, if we can get it honestly; and by our good conduct prevail on our masters to set us free.” God wanted them to obey their masters and who were they to disobey God? Hammon wished for “younger Negroes” to be free but was comfortable remaining a slave because it was all he knew. But the belief that their freedom was bound up in their character and not their literal enslavement set the tone for an important theme in Black conservatism. Lack of morals, not racism or indifference or discrimination, could explain the Black condition.

But even though he has campaigned for him, Jackson has lost some of his enthusiasm for Donald Trump. When he explained when his disillusionment began, I was surprised. Surely, it was when the president refused to do anything to get a handle on the pandemic, which has had a disproportionate impact on Black and Brown communities. Or the economic collapse that his inaction spurred, which has also fallen disproportionately on Black and Brown communities. Or when George Floyd was killed by a white police officer who pressed his knee into his back for nearly nine minutes, and Trump responded to the mass protests with tear gas and federal troops. It turns out, it was much earlier than that. “I traveled across in all 67 counties of the state of Florida for him,” Jackson says. “I did it all. Then Omarosa came in with him and then I wished to God that I had never gotten behind him.”

Commercial roll out of the ambitious 5G technology in India has been in a hang for years now with the delay seemingly stretching over and beyond 2020 as well. While the industry has been in conflict with the government over what it contends as high pricing and scanty availability of the spectrum in the 3.3-3.6 GHz bands, the financial knockout on account of AGR has effectively made the operators incapable of bidding within this fiscal.


  Even though Airtel, Vodafone Idea, Jio and BSNL submitted applications to conduct field trials with DoT on January 15, industry experts still see 5G coming to India by 2022 since telcos having their balance sheets badly bruised lack monetary headroom to bid for the final auctions.


  In contrast, just two days before the new year, on December 30, the government allowed Chinese player Huawei (read all vendors) to conduct field trials in partnership with the telecom players. The move came after India’s prolonged silence over Huawei’s participation in 5G deployments in light of the United States pressing India to bar Huawei from deploying the network. India, however, finally took a position on the issue as it juggles to maintain strategic balance with two of its major trade partners--China and the US.

LONDON (AP) — Royal Dutch Shell increased its dividend payout to shareholders following a better-than-expected third quarter of the year, months after cutting it for the first time since World War II. The oil giant, which is trying to transform itself into a carbon-neutral energy company, said Thursday that it was planning to increase its dividend by 4% to 16.65 U.S. cents per share for the third quarter. “The strength of our performance gives us the confidence to lay out our strategic direction, resume dividend growth and to provide clarity on the cash allocation framework, with clear parameters to increase shareholder distributions,” Chief Executive Ben van Beurden said. The dividend hike came as the company reported earnings on a current cost of supply basis — the industry standard — of $177 million in the July to September period. Though down 97% on last year because of the sharp slide in oil prices, the company's earnings still beat the consensus in financial markets of $146 million. It's certainly a sharp improvement on the performance in the second quarter when the company reported a massive loss of $18.4 billion after it was forced to reassess how much the oil it had in untapped reserves would sell for. “On the face of it, there is a positive direction of travel here that should go some way towards assuaging concerns about Shell’s long-term direction of travel,” said Stuart Lamont, investment manager at Brewin Dolphin. Like others in the sector, Shell has faced a double challenge this year, dealing with plunging oil prices, some of which turned negative for a short while in April, and increased pressure to set new environmental goals. Shell and its U.K. rival BP have pledged to lower emissions to net zero by the middle of the century. . ..

The Franklin County School Board heard an assessment Monday afternoon of what it would take to have students back in the classroom for at least four days a week under pandemic conditions.


  The board’s consensus, ultimately, was that conditions aren’t right for making that leap, at least not yet. Schools Superintendent Mark Church recommended setting a goal to make that change next semester as opposed to implementing it for the second nine weeks.


  Board Vice Chairman Jeff Worley pointed out that the county is the midst of a surge in COVID-19 cases. “We’re in the red,” he said.


  On Sept. 8, the day school started, “we had 251 cases in Franklin County,” said Gills Creek Representative Jon Atchue. “Today we have 806. That’s an increase of 321%.” With seven weeks of school gone past, “600 more people in our community, who are parents, who are brothers, who are commuting back and forth, have COVID.

The protesters raised slogans against the arrest of Mir Shakil-ur-Rahman since March 12 of this year and in support of the media freedom which they said was under threat. Farmanullah Jan, Ehtesham Toru, Shakeel Farman Ali, Sabz Ali Shah, Ansar Abbas, Gohar Ali and others spoke on the occasion. The speakers criticised the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) government for targeting the Jang Media Group and its chief Mir Shakil-ur-Rahman.
 They deplored that Mir Shakil-ur-Rahman had been behind bars for the last 231 days in a case which was based on cooked-up charges. The speakers were critical of the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) for going after the opposition political parties and the independent media and thus becoming a tool in the hands of the government. They slammed the NAB for ignoring the massive corruption scandals such as wheat flour, sugar, Malam Jabba land, Billion Tree Tsunami and Bus Rapid Transit Project as those in the PTI were allegedly linked to these tainted practices.

ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) — A fraternity at the University of Michigan is being sued by its national organization after accepting women as members. A federal judge is holding a hearing Thursday about whether to ease an Oct. 23 order that bars Michigan Sigma Phi from using the national fraternity's name and Greek letters. Since 2016, Michigan Sigma Phi has accepted dozens of members who aren't men or who are nonbinary, a gender identity that is not strictly male or female, said Stephanie Stoneback, a graduate who was president in 2017-18. \"It did feel sort of like we were pioneering something,” Stoneback told The Detroit News. “But honestly, it really just felt like I was joining a group of friends.” Sigma Phi Society, the New York- based national organization, said membership decisions in Ann Arbor are harming the group and its trademarks, according to its lawsuit in federal court in Detroit. “In a nutshell, defendants want to continue to operate as a Sigma Phi chapter, identify as a Sigma Phi chapter, and use the trademarks — without following the rules. Respectfully, defendants cannot have it both ways,\" the lawsuit states. Michigan Sigma Phi was struggling to find people to live in the fraternity house when it decided to expand membership. “These are progressive University of Michigan fraternity members,” said David Nacht, a lawyer for Michigan Sigma Phi. “That is not a phrase you hear often. These are people who are standing up for civil rights, inclusion and gender equality. And we just want to give them a right to do so and have a voice.”

The four-lane southbound crossing historically serves 47,000 vehicles a day. Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, combined two-way traffic has grown nearly 10% this year, from 96,370 to 105,890 weekday trips.
 If that crossing is jammed, drivers can backtrack to a couple other Duwamish River bridges, just south of the city limits. Those are the South Park Bridge, where detouring cars already fill a neighborhood arterial, or the short bridge from Boeing Access Road to International Boulevard South in Tukwila, then uphill into White Center.
 Deb Barker, Morgan Community Association president, expects some drivers will go all the way south on I-5 to Southcenter in Tukwila, turn uphill to Highway 518 in Burien and then backtrack into West Seattle, a route she already takes sometimes.
 "It may be good for people to figure out some other routes, besides First," she said.
 Lora Radford, executive director of the West Seattle Junction Association, said that if possible, the state should avoid restricting other Duwamish River bridges while the West Seattle Bridge is closed.
 However, the Seattle Department of Transportation (SDOT) doesn't expect to finish lasting repairs to the cracked highrise until early 2022, or it may skip that step and move to demolition and a replacement, restoring capacity in 2023 at the soonest.

Tran's food is influenced by Vietnam, where she left as a refugee in the late 1970s, but she doesn't believe the dishes you create should remain static. And so for inspiration she sources the ingredients around her, engages with the cultures she's surrounded by in LA and also looks across the Vietnamese diaspora.

  Will any of these deals actually get better on Black Friday? Doubtful; a lot of them match the all-time-lows offered on Prime Day.

  What's more, if you wait, there's a chance the product you want will be sold out -- precisely because of all the early sales happening now. Food for thought while you browse these deals.

Zeta weakened to a Category 1 hurricane with winds of 90 mph (144 kph) as it moved into southern Mississippi a few hours after landfall.


  As much as 5 feet of Gulf water surrounded a casino in Biloxi, Mississippi, and deputies in Harrison County, Mississippi, received multiple calls from people who had remained in mobile homes that were threatened by winds.


  In the small coastal town of Bay St. Louis in Mississippi, former mayor Les Fillingame said the storm was “very intense” when it blew through.


  “It was a noisy storm. It was a truly howling wind,” he said, but said thankfully it was also fast-moving. “It was a lot of wind for several hours which is enough.”


  Tropical storm warnings were issued as far away as southern Virginia, highly unusual for the region. Forecasters issued a string of tornado warnings for as far east as the Florida Panhandle. And Atlanta, Georgia, was under a tropical storm warning for the second time ever. Its first warning was in 2017 when Hurricane Irma roared into Florida as a deadly Category 4 storm.


  New Orleans was in the warning areas of six previous storms that veered east or west this season. This time, Zeta stayed on course. Officials had been worried about the loss of a power from a turbine that helps power the city's aging drainage infrastructure and whether that would leave the city vulnerable to flooding but Zeta's swift movement meant flooding wasn't an issue.


  On Tuesday, Zeta raked across Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula, toppling trees and briefly cutting power to more than 300,000 people but causing no deaths.


  It then regained strength over the Gulf of Mexico along a path slightly to the east of those of Hurricane Laura, which was blamed for at least 27 deaths in Louisiana in August, and Hurricane Delta, which exacerbated Laura’s damage in the same area weeks later.


  The deteriorating weather prompted early voting sites to close for hours in the western Florida Panhandle. One voter in Mississippi worried about how long felled trees and debris might block roads.


  “With the election I just kind of hope the city gets the roads clear by November 3rd so everybody can get out and vote,” said Mackenzie Umanzor, of D’Iberville, Mississippi.


  An average season sees six hurricanes and 12 named storms. This extraordinarily busy season has focused attention on climate change, which scientists say is causing wetter, stronger and more destructive storms.


  And the fact that so many of the storms have been concentrated in such a small piece of Gulf Coast real estate has meant repeated damage for some places. On Dauphin Island, Alabama, Mayor Jeff Collier said residents and workers had nearly finished cleaning up from Hurricane Sally when the wind started blowing and the water started rising yet again.


  “This is going to put his back to square one again,” Collier said.

At a press conference in Islamabad, Marriyum said the selected hoard has destroyed every department and every sector of Pakistan. She said in the sugar and flour alone, this government has robbed the people's Rs1 trillion already.


  The former information minister said the government robbed Pakistan's Rs3 trillion in the power sector, which has now compounded to Rs7 trillion. The losses due to Peshawar BRT have amounted to Rs150 billion, she said. Marriyum said the Auditor General also caught embezzlement of Rs150 billion, in the Billion Tree Tsunami. She explained that the saplings worth Rs23 per piece were bought for Rs55 per piece and only 23 percent of the claimed saplings were sowed.


  She said that the people of Pakistan were being electrocuted every week by raising electricity tariffs. This will now be followed by another major increase in electricity tariffs in coming month on the direction of the IMF, she added. She said during the PML-N tenure the most economical electricity was produced at Rs12 per unit but today that electricity costs Rs32 per unit under PTI. On top of that, she said, the incompetent government of robbers has more than doubled the circular debt of electricity to Rs2400 billion from Rs1100 billion where PML-N left it. The hike in electricity and gas tariffs has shut down businesses and rendered mass unemployment.


  The PML-N secretary information said that instead of electricity from gas, the PTI gave special permission to import furnace oil and produce electricity from furnace oil to fill the pockets of government ministers while robbing the people of Pakistan. This decision to import furnace oil is Imran Khan's clear violation of power sector merit list, she said.


  Imran did all this to load the ATMs that run the expenses of Banigala with their ill-gotten money under government patronage, she said. The PML-N Quaid Nawaz Sharif added 14000 megawatts to the national grid, saving hundreds and billions of public money but Imran looted Rs7 trillion from them too, she added.


  She said these selected thieves are not only putting up their name plaques on Nawaz's projects but are making money from them too. In the tenure of these selected thieves electricity is extremely expensive yet the recovery is still less.


  Marriyum said the cases, under which Shahbaz Sharif was wrongfully arrested, were being shut down. But despite these cases being shelved, Shahbaz is still behind bars just to give PTI a free hand to continue looting the country, she concluded.

United have adapted their Old Trafford stadium so that 23,500 spectators could watch and be socially distanced under the coronavirus pandemic protocols.


  However, there is a ban on spectators being allowed to enter stadia across sports due to the upsurge in infections in England — which has a huge economic impact on those hosting sporting events.


  Prime Minister Boris Johnson suggested in September this ban could remain in force for six months.


  “It’s quite bemusing to understand why people can gather in other settings such as in a restaurant, or even in a cinema to watch football, when we know we’ve got the plans and the process is ready to deliver a match day here safely,” Roche told Sky.


  “We spent around two months working with the government guidelines to develop the right processes and measures to make sure that we can have around 23,500 people in this stadium safely social distancing.”


  She added that United had plans to introduce staggered arrival times for fans and temperature checks before entry to minimise risks.


  The financial impact of the virus has affected football clubs across the board, although particularly hard hit are those in League One and Two (third and fourth tier) who have no lucrative TV contracts and rely more on those coming through the turnstiles.


  However, even the giants such as United have been affected — they suffered $91 million drop in expected revenue in the period to June 30 2020 as a direct result of it.

ARLINGTON, Texas -- No dogpile, no champagne and a mask on nearly every face -- the Los Angeles Dodgers celebrated their first World Series title since 1988 in a manner no one could have imagined prior to the coronavirus pandemic.
 They did it without Justin Turner, their red-headed star who received a positive test for COVID-19 in the middle of their clinching victory.
 Turner was removed from Los Angeles' 3-1 victory over the Tampa Bay Rays in Game 6 on Tuesday night after registering Major League Baseball's first positive test in 59 days and wasn't on the field as the Dodgers enjoyed the spoils of a title earned during a most unusual season.
 "Thanks to everyone reaching out!," Turner said on Twitter. "I feel great, no symptoms at all. Just experienced every emotion you can possibly imagine. Can't believe I couldn't be out there to celebrate with my guys! So proud of this team & unbelievably happy for the City of LA."
 Commissioner Rob Manfred confirmed Turner's positive test moments after presenting the World Series trophy to Los Angeles -- a jarring reminder of all that's been different in this season where the perennially favored Dodgers finally broke through.
 Mookie Betts, who came to the Dodgers to make a World Series difference, had a mad dash to home plate in the sixth inning to put Los Angeles over the top.
 The end of a frustrating championship drought for LA -- and perhaps just the start for Betts and the Dodgers, whose seventh World Series title was their sixth since leaving Brooklyn to the West Coast in 1958.
 Betts bolted from third for the go-ahead run on World Series MVP Corey Seager's infield grounder, then led off the eighth with a punctuating homer.
 "I just came to be a part of it. I'm just happy I could contribute," Betts said
 Clayton Kershaw was warming in the bullpen when Julio Urias struck out Willy Adames to end it and ran alongside teammates to celebrate in the infield, later joined by family who had been in the bubble with them in North Texas. Players were handed face masks as they gathered, although many of their embraces came mask-free even after Turner's positive test.
 The Dodgers had played 5,014 regular season games and were in their 114th postseason game since Orel Hershiser struck out Oakland's Tony Phillips for the final out of the World Series in 1988, the same year Kershaw -- the three- time NL Cy Young Award winner who won Games 1 and 5 of this Series -- was born in nearby Dallas.
 Los Angeles had come up short in the World Series twice in the previous three years. Betts was on the other side two years ago and homered in the clinching Game 5 for the Boston Red Sox, who before this season traded the 2018 AL MVP to the Dodgers. They later gave him a $365 million, 12-year extension that goes until he turns 40 in 2032.
 Betts' 3.2-second sprint was just enough to beat the throw by first baseman Ji-Man Choi, pushing Los Angeles ahead 2-1 moments after Rays manager Kevin Cash pulled ace left-hander Blake Snell despite a dominant performance over 5 1/3 innings.
 "I'm not exactly sure why," Betts said when asked about the move. "I'm not going to ask any questions. He was pitching a great game."
 Randy Arozarena, the powerful Tampa Bay rookie, extended his postseason record with his 10th homer in the first off rookie right-hander Tony Gonsolin, the first of seven Dodgers pitchers. The Rays never got another runner past second base as LA's bullpen gave reliever-reliant Tampa Bay a taste of its own medicine.
 About 2 1/2 weeks after the Lakers won the NBA title while finishing their season in the NBA bubble in Orlando, Florida, the Dodgers gave Los Angeles another championship in this year when the novel coronavirus pandemic has delayed, shortened and moved around sports seasons.
 Seager, also the NLCS MVP, set Dodgers records with eight homers and 20 RBIs this postseason.
 The MLB season didn't start until late July and was abbreviated to 60 games for the shortest regular season since 1878. And the expanded postseason, with 16 teams making it instead of 10, almost went the full distance.
 It ended when Urias got the last two out Tampa Bay batters on called third strikes -- the 15th and 16 Ks by the Rays, with catcher Austin Barnes stuffing the last pitch in his back pocket. Along with the 11 strikeouts by the Dodgers, it was the most combined strikeouts in a nine-inning World Series game.

Liverpool and Manchester City also made it six points out of a possible six in Europe this season, after Bayern needed a late Joshua Kimmich strike to claim a 2-1 win at Lokomotiv Moscow in Group A.


  Leon Goretzka put the Germans ahead early on in front of a limited crowd in the Russian capital, but Anton Miranchuk tucked in an equaliser for Lokomotiv in the second half — Miranchuk’s twin brother Aleksei scored for Atalanta in the Champions League last week.


  But Bayern were not to be denied a record 13th straight win in the competition as Kimmich controlled a Javi Martinez pass and volleyed home low from outside the box 11 minutes from time.


  “We had to work hard for the victory,” Kimmich admitted to broadcaster DAZN.


  In the same group Atletico Madrid came from behind to beat Salzburg 3-2, with Joao Felix grabbing their late winner.


  The Portuguese starlet had hit the bar with a stunning overhead kick before Marcos Llorente put Atletico ahead in the Spanish capital.


  Dominik Szoboszlai levelled before the break and then a Felipe own goal put Salzburg ahead just after half-time.


  However, Joao Felix equalised on 52 minutes and then won it five minutes from the end.


  In Germany, Real were heading for another defeat in Group B, six days after losing 3-2 at home to Shakhtar Donetsk, as Marcus Thuram netted twice for Gladbach, either side of half-time.


  But Casemiro set up Karim Benzema to reduce the deficit in the 87th minute and the Brazilian midfielder then scored himself deep in injury time to salvage a point for Zinedine Zidane’s team.


  “If we continue to play like that, we’ll do great things and we’ll win matches, that’s for sure,” said Zidane.


  It is Shakhtar who lead the section, though, by two points from Inter Milan and Gladbach, after a 0-0 draw with the Italians in Kiev.


  Pep Guardiola’s City eased to a second straight win in Group C with Kevin De Bruyne setting up Ferran Torres for the early opener against Marseille after the hosts had carelessly ceded possession.


  Ilkay Gundogan and Raheem Sterling added late goals to make it 3-0, leaving Marseille without a point.


  Guardiola was confident City could build on their victory after an indifferent start to the Premier League season which has seen them come in for criticism.


  “Part of the criticism was right, but you’ve got to accept it. It’s part of our job,” Guardiola told BT Sport.


  “It’s about where we’ve come from in the last month, with lack of preparation, injuries and Covid-19, but the Champions League is in a good place now.”


  In the same group Porto beat Olympiakos 2-0 in Portugal with Fabio Vieira and Sergio Oliveira on target.


  Meanwhile, Liverpool built on their 1-0 victory at Ajax last week by defeating Danish champions Midtjylland 2-0 in a low-key game behind closed doors at Anfield in Group D.


  Diogo Jota finished off a fine move to give Jurgen Klopp’s team the lead early in the second half, before Mohamed Salah made sure of the points with a late penalty.


  Klopp rested Salah, Sadio Mane and Roberto Firmino from his starting line-up but his defensive worries deepened as Fabinho went off with an apparent hamstring injury.


  “It was a tough night,” Klopp told BT Sport.


  “It’s a bit like in a marriage, there are good and bad times. It’s not a bad time but it’s a tricky time.”


  He added: “It was a hard game to play. But winning 2-0 is completely fine so that’s it — let’s carry on.”


  Liverpool now have a double-header against Atalanta, who came from 2-0 down to draw 2-2 at home to Ajax.


  A Dusan Tadic penalty put the visitors ahead on the half-hour and Lassina Traore made it two, only for Duvan Zapata to save Atalanta with two goals in the space of seven second-half minutes.

Noah Baumbach’s coming-of-age dramedy “Kicking and Screaming” turned 25 this October. The film, unrelated to the more popular Will Ferrell movie of the same title, is a roaringly funny examination of several recent college graduates as they are forced to come to terms with the fact that they have their whole lives ahead of them.


  The film captures the essence of a time in life when uncertainty and anxiety rule and the only thing one wants is to be back on solid ground. The film’s main characters, four close friends who lived and graduated together, see themselves pulled in different directions in the months after graduation. One of them re-enrolls in school in order to prolong his life as a student, another keeps intentionally missing flights to Milwaukee, the city where he’d been accepted to grad school, and a third complains about not having a job, yet never tries to find one. The former students attend campus bars, go to student parties and sleep with people much younger than them, all as a kind of denial — a refusal to move on with their lives. The characters squirm and writhe miserably as they’re slowly forced to cope with their lives, all of them grasping desperately for a way to keep from growing up. They’re scared, and even as time drags them forward, they fight to go back.


  The film is remarkable because Baumbach manages to capture the emotions and actions of that uncertain time period with grace. He understands the desire to run away from the big world and return to a place of familiar comfort. The film is tinged with melancholy and nostalgia. Baumbach was 26 when he made this film, relatively fresh out of college himself. His own experiences undoubtedly inspired this film and provided him with deep insight into the emotions of his characters and the feel of that time in life.

SC in a closed hearing on January 16 dismissed Airtel, Vodafone Idea and Tata Teleservices' plea that they had filed back in November asking the court for a review of its October AGR ruling. Airtel and VIL have said they are likely to file curative petitions with January 23 due date impending in sight. The rejection to extend any help to carriers could potentially lead to a two player industry, analysts believe. VIL being left in the lurch could be seeing exiting the industry as KM Birla has previously said.


  Tariff revisions are believed to take the sector towards recovery, however, more clarity on where exactly the industry will be headed to will come post January 23 deadline of paying AGR compensation.


  Additionally, ahead of the Union budget coming on February 1, the industry which is being weighed down by multiple taxes and levies has reportedly asked the government for aid in the form of reduction of regulatory levies, taxes and license fees with lower interest rates to access credit. Demands for removal of GST from license fee and spectrum usage charges have also been made.

New Delhi: Bharti Airtel has delivered "solid" all round performance in the September quarter with revenue surpassing estimates, while its India mobile metrics logged improvement in key areas like growth in total subscribers without ARPU dilution, and 4G additions, according to analysts. ICICI Securities said Bharti Airtel's second quarter numbers underlined "superior execution" in India mobile and other segments.      "Bharti's India mobile print shows marked improvement in many areas such as growth in total subs without ARPU dilution which shows quality of customer addition; lower churn rate increasing life-time value of customers and continued delivery of 4G net add, which has now likely matched the market leader," it said in a report on Tuesday.      ICICI Securities believes that higher 4G subscriber base will enable the telco to better transfer tariff hike into Average Revenue Per User (ARPU), whenever such hike happens.     


  On Tuesday, Bharti Airtel reported its highest-ever quarterly consolidated revenue, on the back of a rise in data usage and higher realisations, helping narrow losses.      Consolidated revenue for India's No.2 telecom operator rose 22 per cent to Rs 25,785 crore in the July-September quarter while net loss narrowed to Rs 763 crore.      Goldman Sachs has termed Airtel's Q2 as "another solid quarter" and noted that the telco surpassed estimates, both on topline and operating profit level.      A key surprise was the strong data subscriber addition, which Goldman Sachs estimated could result in some ARPU increase in the December quarter.      Data for the last 9-12 months suggests Bharti has largely closed the gap versus Jio on wireless revenue growth, while Bharti's divergence with Vodafone Idea has continued, Goldman Sachs said.      "We expect this quarter to be no different, and forecast 4 per cent quarter- on-quarter revenue growth for both Jio and Vodafone Idea, versus 7 per cent for Bharti," the Goldman Sachs note said.      CLSA, in its report, observed that Airtel's September quarter revenue and Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortisation or EBITDA were "ahead of estimates", its India mobile 4G and subscriber momentum was "strong", and its ramp-up in non-mobile businesses "commendable".     


  In a note on Tuesday evening, Jefferies said Airtel's 14 million subscriber additions and sequential margin expansion in India mobile and growth in Africa operations "surprised positively".      "We remain constructive despite uncertainty around timing of next tariff hike, as, in its absence, market share gains are playing out," it added.

Sixth, the President chose to demonize researchers whose findings did not suit him (such as calling the work of researchers finding no benefit to hydroxychloroquine, an "enemy statement"), thereby putting some scientists in the position of not only defending their science but also their motives for conducting urgent and important research in the first place. Such assaults on science and scientists can lead researchers to think twice about engaging in potentially lifesaving work, and can set back the scientific process such that evidence-based answers to pressing societal challenges are slower in their evolution.


  Seventh, White House Task Force member Dr. Scott Atlas and Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar have met with and embraced proponents of the Great Barrington Declaration. The Declaration proposes to achieve herd immunity (before a vaccine is available) by protecting older persons yet removing most SARS-CoV-2 preventive measures among young people. Although he did not cite the Declaration, White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows recently said on CNN that "we are not going to control the pandemic," a sentiment consistent with the Great Barrington document. This herd immunity approach has been widely criticized by many in the public health community, because by not having in place the necessary preventive precautions, it could yield substantial expansion of Covid-19 cases in the US and induce serious increases in morbidity and mortality.


  Eighth, the President interpreted his personal experience of receiving world- class, life-saving, experimental medical care from a single-source, government run and supported program to be the kind of care that everyone in the US can have (especially as he supports the destruction of the Affordable Care Act, the means to health insurance for millions in the US). Further, based on his experience of medical care privilege, he told the residents of the US not to fear Covid and to not let it dominate their lives ... clearly dangerous health care advice for many and especially those without access to the same level of health care he enjoyed.


  Ninth, the President, his administration and his campaign have held or attended events in which they ignored most if not all public health recommendations for Covid-19 prevention. For instance, the first family brazenly took off their masks at the initial presidential debate despite the rules of the Commission on Presidential Debates and the Cleveland Clinic health care experts on site. One is reminded of celebrity Fernando Lamas saying, "it is better to look good than to feel good." Well, that ironic phrase is not one we utilize in public health.


  Tenth, the devastating disparities of Covid-19 in communities of color are matters of social justice, and yet the President barely seems to notice or acknowledge them. Clearly, to alleviate the suffering from Covid-19 in the US, one must address the injustice of these racial, ethnic and socioeconomic disparities and begin to better build health equity.


  Eleventh, if the administration wanted to address these issues, there would be a comprehensive, evidence-based national Covid-19 strategy, but there is no such national plan at this point. Without a plan in place, there can be no tracking of key metrics, no informed mid-course corrections, and little accountability.


  Twelfth, there are instances when members of the administration are giving out risky information, undermining the American public's ability to inform and protect itself. Just recently, White House adviser Dr. Scott Atlas tweeted "Masks work? NO" (synergistic with the President's less than enthusiastic attitude toward mask use), despite substantial evidence to the contrary.


  It is difficult to assess the precise number of deaths, life years lost, and lives disrupted by this collection of errors of commission, omission and complacency, but it is clear that a large number of the over 225,000 lives lost to Covid-19 could have been saved had these errors been avoided with straightforward, evidence-based precautions in place, delivered at the necessary scale, and provided at the right time.


  Going forward, I encourage the administration and all public health decision makers to keep in mind this definition of a public health error, to avoid such serious mistakes, and to accept the responsibility for their errors when they do occur. Just like surgeons go to great lengths to avoid leaving instruments inside of patients, we must avoid errors in public health. With either type of error, the outcomes can be deadly and in public health the devastation can be even more widespread.

NEW ORLEANS (AP) — A fast-moving Zeta weakened to a tropical storm as it barreled northeast Thursday morning after ripping through Louisiana and Mississippi where storm-weary residents were advised to stay indoors overnight while officials assessed the havoc the storm had wrought.


  The storm raged onshore Wednesday afternoon in the small village of Cocodrie in Louisiana as a strong Category 2 and then moved swiftly across the New Orleans area and into neighboring Mississippi, bringing with it both fierce winds and storm surge. There was heavy rain at times but since the storm was so fast-moving, rain related flooding wasn't as much of a concern.


  Zeta weakened over central Alabama but its strong winds continued across portions of the state and the Florida Panhandle. The storm was about 65 miles (104 kilometers) west northwest of Atlanta, Georgia, with maximum sustained winds of 60 mph (96 kph). Zeta is moving quickly toward the northeast at 39 mph (62 kph).

Where we need to pause is when we start bringing the Bronco's cybersecurity systems and engine control unit into the mix. This past August, the Bronco's Program Manager Jeff Seaman said the automaker will need to "walk carefully" when it comes to granting access to the Bronco's innards. As cars become more connected than ever, automakers consistently need to ensure they're not vulnerable to hacks. Handing over a simplified ECU to a tuning company could put the automaker and drivers at risk.


  It's a controversy we've seen in recent years as the possibility of automakers picking and choosing favorite tuners comes to light. HPE previously announced big upgrades for the 2020 Chevy Corvette Stingray, which uses GM's latest, hardened electrical platform for cybersecurity. Nothing has come to fruition for the sports car yet at HPE. Curiously, the company lists a "Ford wiring harness and ECU" as part of the upgrades for the Bronco, so it could be HPE has its ducks in a row for the SUV. Ford did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the tuning firm's plans.


  Potential difficulties aside, I think it's safe to say we all want to see a V8-powered Bronco become a thing.

Chicago Bears coach Matt Nagy is sticking with quarterback Nick Foles over Mitchell Trubisky and intends to keep calling plays on offense at least for now.


   


  He made that clear Tuesday, a day after an ugly 24-10 loss to the Rams. The Bears' poor performance at Los Angeles added more fuel to the idea that their sparkling record was more of a mirage than a reflection of how good they are.


   


  But if changes are coming, there won't be one behind center.


   


  "We have a lot of confidence and I have a lot of confidence in Nick right now with where he's at," he said. "Again, this is a process for us to work though, and it's not just one person. It's really not."


   


  The Bears (5-2) fell out of the NFC North lead with their first road loss. And their quarterback had a difficult time with the offensive line getting overwhelmed.


   


  Foles completed 28 of 40 passes for 261 yards without a touchdown. He was sacked four times -- twice by former Bears linebacker Leonard Floyd -- and threw two interceptions.


   


  Too often, Foles was unable to step into his throws with defenders bearing down on him. But Nagy dismissed the idea of going back to the more mobile Trubisky, who started the first three games before getting benched.


   


  "In regards to a mobile quarterback, I'm not so sure that that's the answer with that, with what we're talking about, with the drop-back of a quarterback and the tackle situation," Nagy said.


   


  The Bears are averaging a league-low 84.1 yards rushing, and rank 29th in total yards per game and 27th in scoring (19.7 points).


   


  Clearly, they have a wide range of issues. When it comes to who's calling plays, Nagy is open to handing off those duties. But for now, he is staying the course.


   


  "Right now, where we're at, that's not where we think it's at," Nagy said. "But at the same point in time, I'll always continue each week to look at it. I'll say this, too. When you're in a little bit of a rut like we are, a lot of bit of a rut like we are right now, you have to look at everything."


   


  By no means was it a great night, with the Bears allowing a season-high 161 yards rushing and 371 yards in all. But the defense produced Chicago's lone touchdown, when Eddie Jackson returned a fumble 8 yards in the fourth quarter.


   


  The line continues to be a big issue for the Bears. And they don't appear to have any real solutions on the bench. Unless they bring in outside help, any improvement will have to come from within.


   


  TE Cole Kmet. The second-round draft pick from Notre Dame is playing his way into a bigger role. He caught a touchdown in the win at Carolina last week, and he had a neat grab on Monday night. With Foles throwing across his body, Kmet turned, leaped and hauled in a 38-yard pass over Justin Hollins along the left sideline.


   


  "He's making plays," Nagy said. "There's a trust element there I think you're starting to really see and it's growing, and when you have a ball thrown your way when you're absolutely covered and you make a play, that's neat to see."


   


  PR Ted Ginn Jr. The 35-year-old Ginn simply hasn't been the steady hand the Bears needed once Tarik Cohen tore his ACL in Chicago's win at Atlanta in Week 3. Against the Rams, he looked helpless. Ginn did not run one back as Johnny Hekker buried the Bears inside the 10 on all five of his punts. He has five returns for 24 yards since Cohen went down. And with just three receptions for 40 yards, he's not giving the Bears much on offense, either.


   


  Center Cody Whitehair injured his calf in the second half, though Nagy said after the game he thought Whitehair was OK.

Our Texas Economic Activity Index improved for the second straight month in August, following the lockdown swoon from March through June. We expect to see further improvement in the Texas Index for September. In August, eight out of nine index components were positive, including nonfarm employment, unemployment insurance claims (inverted), housing starts, house prices, industrial electricity demand, total state trade, hotel occupancy and sales tax revenues. Only the drilling rig count sub-index remained in the red. We expect the rig count sub-index to turn mildly positive late this year reflecting recent stabilization and nascent gains in September. However, recent softer oil prices may challenge that assumption. Texas has four sets of economic risk factors that will be active through the remainder of this year. The first is regional coronavirus spread. Like most other states, Texas is seeing an increase in cases this fall. We do not expect to see a return to strict statewide social mitigation practices for the remainder of this year, but there is certainly potential for that outcome. The second big risk factor is the strength of the U.S. and global economies through the fourth quarter. Third is the specific risk to the energy industry. While Texas continues to diversify its economy, the energy industry remains a key accelerator for the state. The fourth set of risk factors include other idiosyncratic risks to key Texas industries, including airlines.

(The Conversation is an independent and nonprofit source of news, analysis and commentary from academic experts.) Juliet B. Schor, Boston College (THE CONVERSATION) Voters in California will decide in November whether Uber drivers and other gig economy workers should be considered employees or contractors – a question that’s been debated and litigated for many years now. On the surface, the issue pits the flexibility that comes with being independent against the higher incomes and benefits that employees tend to get. Uber, Doordash and others say the proposition they put on the ballot in California would split the difference by keeping them contractors – “with benefits.” I’ve been studying gig labor for nearly a decade. Since 2013, I’ve led teams that have interviewed more than 200 workers on platforms such as TaskRabbit, Postmates, Uber and other apps to learn about their experiences, earning patterns, desires and constraints. I believe there is a better way to marry flexibility with a livable wage. What workers want It’s true that gig workers want flexibility, autonomy and life without a boss. But my team and I also found that the lack of benefits and available work mean it’s almost impossible to earn a reliable primary income on these platforms. Those who tried to earn a full-time living on the platforms typically made less than the official poverty line, even when their hourly wages were decent. A separate 2020 San Francisco study found that ride-hail drivers were earning US$360 per week, after expenses. That’s $9 an hour for a 40-hour work week – and even less for the majority who work more than that. Almost half of the ride-hail and delivery workers in that study could not cover a $400 expense without borrowing. These poor conditions...

Special Representative of Prime Minister on Religious Harmony, Maulana Tahir Ashrafi, went to the seminary and offered fateha for those martyred in the terror incident. Talking to the media, he said he had visited the seminary on the special directives of Prime Minister Imran Khan. Maulana Tahir Ashrafi said culprits involved in this barbaric act have nothing to do with humanity. “I am proud to be students of a madrassa and the martyred students are children of Pakistan,” he said and hoped that enemies of the country would fail to achieve their ulterior motives by such acts of cowardice.
 The special representative of the prime minister said India was involved in funding groups in Afghanistan, adding Pakistan was being targetted for talking about peace in neighbouring Afghanistan. He said the nation would not forget the martyrs of the motherland and their sacrifices for the country would always be remembered. Meanwhile, a central leader of Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (JUI) Mufti Kifayatullah condemned the brutal attack on the seminary.
 He demanded the government to constitute a judicial inquiry to look into the matter and fix responsibility. The JUI leader was talking to reporters during his visit to the seminary. “The government should form a judicial inquiry under a Supreme Court’s serving judge,” Mufti Kifayat said. The JUI leader said the terror incident was pre-planned. It was a continuation of the killing of Maulana Mohammad Adil in Karachi recently after which Sheikh Rasheed Ahmad spilled the beans, he said.
 He said the terrorist incidents were aimed at terrorising the political and religious forces to stay away from the democratic movement. He said the matter should be resolved once and for all and the only solution was to conduct judicial inquiry into the issue.
 Mutfi Kifayatullah visited Lady Reading Hospital (LRH) and inquired after the injured students. Earlier, central chief of Jamaat-e-Islami Sirajul Haq visited the LRH and inquired after the health of the victims of the blasts. He was accompanied by provincial president of the party Senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan, party’s parliamentary leader in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly Inayatullah Khan. The JI chief condemned the incident and blasted the government for its failure to provide protection to the people. He said the government had badly failed on all fronts. He said the government was unable to take steps to provide security to the people.

Talk about Idaho’s version of “Groundhog Day,” the movie where Bill Murray reawakes to endlessly repeating the same day.
 The ink wasn’t even dry on Idaho’s improving tax receipts earlier this month before Gov. Brad Little and lawmakers started talking about tax cuts.
 This is part of a sorry pattern in the Gem State.
 When the economy stalls, governors and lawmakers hack away at budgets. Later, they happily discover they cut too deeply. So when the money starts flowing in, they declare a surplus. Rather than restore programs, they say the money belongs to the taxpayers.
 This systematic hollowing out of public resources is how Idaho wound up with the lowest per-pupil public school expenditures in the country while homeowners are forced to compensate with record-setting supplemental property taxes.
 It’s why students attending Idaho’s struggling institutions of higher learning wound up paying so much more in tuition.
 And it explains why Idaho is having difficulty paying a competitive wage to school teachers and many of its public employees.
 Here’s how it could happen again. As the economy sank under the weight of COVID-19, state coffers suffered and spending was slashed. Now that the economy is recovering, so have tax revenues.
 Consider the legislative budget office’s analysis of the $587 million surplus:
 l Subtract the $98.7 million hole in the public school budget. Although federal coronavirus relief funds came to the rescue this year, that money was available only once. For K-12 to fully recover, next year’s Legislature must restore that money on a permanent basis, to say nothing of meeting the costs of rising enrollments and inflation for the school year that follows.
 l Then there’s the $96.5 million still missing from the rest of Idaho’s general fund, which covers everything from higher education to public safety to health. Colleges and universities alone are in a precarious spot. Their bare-bones budgets were tied to a tuition freeze before the cuts were imposed. Since then, enrollments — and tuition dollars — have slipped due to the pandemic.
 l A good deal of this money is available for one time use. That includes $186.3 million in a cash balance plus another $60.3 million in Medicaid savings that emerged when the bookkeeping was completed. Invest this money in a permanent tax cut and you’ve created a budget deficit that will continue year after year.
 l All of which leaves about $102.6 million in new tax collections. That includes a 4.4 percent spike in sales tax collections, which can be traced to the federal stimulus dollars spread throughout Idaho’s economy. Less easily explained is the 17.1 percent increase in income tax collections and a 2.7 percent rise in corporate taxes.
 The picture may become clearer as more collections flow into the state coffers during the end of the year and possibly early into 2021. But even if you throw in the new sales tax collections from internet transactions, the state would have to stretch to meet the cost of eliminating the sales tax on groceries, which comes in at about $200 million.
 Where would the money come from to cover investments in veteran teacher pay, shore up the state’s institutions of higher learning or tend to an ever-rising number of people held in Idaho’s overcrowded prison system?
 Before you cast your ballot, take this up with the people who want to serve in Idaho’s Legislature. — M.T.

But you need some history to explain how we arrived at a place where the conservative views of Black people don't necessarily manifest in Republican votes. The story of Jackie Robinson, the first Black man to break Major League Baseball’s color line when he played for the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1947, is instructive. Robinson was a loyal Republican. This was not terribly bizarre in the 1950s. While Black people had begun migrating into the Democratic column in the 1920s, the party's appeasement of its racist Southern wing meant that a significant share of Black votes was up for grabs in the 1950s. Republican President Eisenhower, who sent troops into Little Rock to enforce a school desegregation order and oversaw the passage of the first civil rights bill since Reconstruction, won an estimated 39 percent of nonwhite votes in 1956.

Despite the film’s serious, almost grim subject matter, it’s not all dour. Most of the film is absolutely hilarious, as sharply written dialogue provides a near-constant source of raucous humor. Even as characters discuss big life changes and their fear and sadness lie visible on their faces, “Kicking and Screaming” is a riot. Baumbach proves his fantastic ability as a writer with this film.


  The characters are bitter and pretentious, yet oddly loveable and deeply relatable. Starring Josh Hamilton, Olivia d’Abo, Elliott Gould and Jason Wiles as well as standout performances by Carlos Jacott, Eric Stoltz and Chris Eigeman, the acting is solid. It’s not an easy task to make pretentious, sad and angry young adults into lovable characters, yet the cast manages wonderfully as there’s not one genuinely dislikable person onscreen. That’s a testament, not only to the actors, but to Baumbach’s writing as well.


  Overall, “Kicking and Screaming” is an excellent film that should be required viewing for any soon-to-be college graduate. It captures the emotions and anxieties of that uncertain time in one’s life with such grace, all while adeptly turning a group of jerks into relatable characters and providing laugh-a-minute comedy. Baumbach would go on to make many other great films in the 25 years since this one was released, but “Kicking and Screaming” makes for one hell of a debut.

Like the fantastic EVGA RTX 3080 FTW3 Ultra, this 3070 incarnation costs a steep premium—$610, versus the Nvidia FE’s $500—but you’re paying for every overclocking-friendly feature you could ask for. While Nvidia shrank the RTX 3070 Founders Edition design, which affected noise levels, EVGA stuck to a beefy 3-slot build for the FTW3 Ultra, using heavy metal to tame the Ampere GPU inside. EVGA supplemented the massive cooler with all sorts of tools that make it easier to top the 3DMark leaderboards, like dual BIOSes, several integrated temperature sensors to monitor various parts of the card, a dedicated fan control header, and more.


  Does it make sense to spend over $600 on a loaded RTX 3070 when you can upgrade to the much more powerful RTX 3080 for just $100 more? And does AMD’s looming $579 Radeon RX 6800 change the equation? Let’s examine the EVGA GeForce RTX 3070 FTW3 Ultra.

  ## EVGA GeForce RTX 3070 FTW3 Ultra specs, features, and design


  Here’s a recap of the GeForce RTX 3070’s key technical specifications, compared against its direct predecessor, the $500 RTX 2070, as well as the $1,200 RTX 2080 Ti with which it trades blows in gaming performance.

  EVGA changes only two key underlying technical specs with the RTX 3070 FTW3 Ultra, with the rest of its rejiggering dedicated to the cooler design and extra features. Most people will notice the increased clock speeds first. While the RTX 3070 reference specification hits a 1,725MHz boost clock, EVGA cranked the FTW3 Ultra up to 1,815MHz, a 90Hz increase. That gives it an out- of-the-box boost in gaming frame rates. It’s a small bump, but as you’ll see in our benchmarks section, it’s enough to move past the RTX 2080 Ti pretty much across the board—something that Nvidia’s Founders Edition couldn’t quite manage.


  If you’re buying this card, though, you’re probably not planning to stick to stock speeds. Just as important to the FTW3 Ultra’s mission is its increased power requirements. Stock RTX 3070 cards draw 250 watts over a single 8-pin power connector, coming from a recommended 550W power supply. In its quest for overclocking glory, the FTW3 Ultra bumps that up to a pair of 8-pin power connectors and recommends hooking the card up to a sturdier 650W power supply. (There’s no need to fiddle with ugly 12-pin adapters like you do with Nvidia’s Founders Edition, however.)

_The_ Omarosa? The Omarosa Manigault Newman who had been a contestant on _The Apprentice_ and gone on to a White House job? Though a long-time Democrat, she joined Trump’s campaign as the director of outreach for African Americans and then his administration in the Office of Public Liaison. “I realized very quickly that she was not going to be the voice of reason between him and the Black community,” Jackson says of Newman. “It was all about her.” Jackson could not fathom why any Black voter would take Trump seriously if he thought Omarosa was the best person for the job. “She didn't give a damn about Black America,” Jackson notes, “which in retrospect shows that [Trump] didn't give a damn about Black America.” Newman was fired in December 2017 after less than a year on the job. She claimed Trump was a racist, and that she'd heard tape of Trump using racial slurs. To Jackson, Trump relying on someone who was more interested in self-promotion than actual political outreach proved that wasn't really interested in reaching out to Black voters. It revealed a stunning lack of self-reflection.

In response to the advances made during Lyndon Johnson’s Great Society initiative, the Nixon administration concocted policies that would dismantle the programs established by Johnson to fight poverty. Behind the scenes, the racism was much more explicit. One 1971 conversation between President Nixon and California Gov. Ronald Reagan was recently revealed by Tim Naftali, a professor of history at New York University. Reagan disparaged the African delegates to the UN as “monkeys from those African counties—damn them, they’re still uncomfortable wearing shoes.” Nixon responded with a laugh at the gross characterization. A year later, Nixon, who championed “the great silent majority” (yet another in a long list of euphemisms for white people), sought to put a moratorium on school busing that was intended to bring some measure of equality to American education.

If you have any thoughts on this phenomenon please share them in the comments below, but do not name names. Suffice that we try to work out what is going on here - are these "Lockdown Legacy Catholics" staying away from church out of a [human but faithless] fear of "the virus", or is the virus merely an excuse to re-structure life in such a way that God's law does not interfere too much with their secular lives? Were they always Catholics of weak Faith, or what… What's the mentality - I'm genuinely puzzled. Over to thee…
