BERLIN (AP) — Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny was poisoned with the same type of Soviet-era nerve agent that British authorities identified in a 2018 attack on a former Russian spy, the German government said Wednesday, citing new test results.Chancellor Angela Merkel’s spokesman, Steffen Seibert, said in a statement that testing by a special German military laboratory at the Charite’s request had now shown “proof without doubt of a chemical nerve agent from the Novichok group.”“It is a dismaying event that Alexei Navalny was the victim of an attack with a chemical nerve agent in Russia,” Seibert said. “The German government condemns this attack in the strongest terms.”Navalny, a politician and corruption investigator who is one of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s fiercest critics, fell ill on a flight back to Moscow from Siberia on Aug 20 and was taken to a hospital in the Siberian city of Omsk after the plane made an emergency landing. He was transferred two days later to Berlin’s Charité hospital, where doctors last week said initial tests indicated Navalny had been poisoned.British authorities identified Novichok as the poison used in 2018 on former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter in England. The nerve agent is a cholinesterase inhibitor, part of the class of substances that doctors at the Charite initially identified in Navalny.Germany demanded a response from the Russian government. The Kremlin said Wednesday it hadn’t been informed yet of Navalny being poisoned with a nerve agent.“Such information hasn’t been relayed to us,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told the state Tass news agency.Seibert said the German government would inform its partners in the European Union and NATO about the test results. He said that it will consult with its partners in light of the Russian response “on an appropriate joint response.” Germany also will contact the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, he added.Navalny’s allies in Russia have insisted he was deliberately poisoned by the country’s authorities, accusations that the Kremlin rejected as “empty noise.” “To poison Navalny with Novichok in 2020 would be exactly the same as leaving an autograph at a crime scene, like this one,” Navalny’s longtime ally and strategist Leonid Volkov said in a tweet that featured a photo of Putin’s name and a signature next to it.The Russian doctors who treated Navalny in Siberia repeatedly contested the German hospital’s poisoning conclusion, saying they had ruled out poisoning as a diagnosis and that their tests for cholinesterase inhibitors came back negative.In the Charite’s latest update, the hospital said Navalny was still in an induced coma but in stable condition. Novichok is a class of military- grade nerve agents developed by the Soviet Union at the end of the Cold War. Western weapons experts say it was only ever manufactured in Russia. After the Skripals were poisoned, Russia said the U.S., Britain and other Western countries acquired the expertise to make the nerve agent after the Soviet Union collapsed, and that the Novichok used in the attack could have come from them.According to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, there is no record of Novichok having been declared by any nation that signed the chemical weapons convention.Britain has charged two Russians -- alleged to be agents of the Russian military intelligence service GRU --- in absentia with the 2018 attack, which left the Skripals in critical condition and killed a local woman. Russia has refused to extradite the men to the U.K.British police believe the nerve agent was smuggled to Britain in a counterfeit Nina Ricci perfume bottle and sprayed on the front door of Sergei Skripal’s house in the city of Salisbury in southwest England.More than three months later, the bottle was found by a local man, 48-year-old Charlie Rowley. He was hospitalized and his girlfriend Dawn Sturgess, 44, died after being exposed to the contents.____Daria Litvinova in Moscow and Jill Lawless in London contributed to this story Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.

VANDENBERG AIR FORCE BASE, Calif. (AP) — The Air Force says an unarmed Minuteman 3 intercontinental ballistic missile has been launched from California to a target in the Pacific Ocean in a test of the system. The missile blasted off from a silo at Vandenberg Air Force Base shortly after midnight Wednesday and its re-entry vehicle traveled approximately 4,200 miles to the Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands. The Air Force says test launches verify accuracy and reliability. The missile was brought to Vandenberg from Minot Air Force Base, North Dakota, but crews involved in the test came from an array of units. The Air Force says this demonstrates redundant capability during the coronavirus pandemic.

Attorneys for Perkins Coie filed a lawsuit in Richmond on Tuesday on behalf of two people who say they were tricked into signing an “Elector Oath” backing West’s candidacy. Under state law, a candidate must have 13 electors pledge their support for a candidate as part of the criteria to appear on the ballot. The lawsuit alleges that 11 of West’s 13 electors may be invalid and asks the court to block West’s name from appearing on ballots.

President of the Ghana Football Association, Kurt Okraku, has said that monies from the FIFA Forward 2.0 would be invested in the construction of infrastructures at the Ghanaman Soccer Centre of Excellence.   The FA is expected to receive $6 million in four years from FIFA, as monies to support the member federation.   At the 26th Congress of the Football Association yesterday, Mr Okraku announced the money would be used to build a gym, a swimming pool and a multipurpose court.   “The FIFA Forward 1.0 programme will also see an investment of $280,000 into boreholes at League Centres and Game Centres across the nation as well as upgrade in I.T to improve competitions. It involves supply of PCs, Scanners, printers as well as internet to clubs," he said.   “We will also use some of the money from the FIFA Forward 2.0 to complete projects like a multipurpose court, a swimming pool, a gym and others here at the Ghanaman Soccer Center of Excellence,” he added.   In a related development, the GFA Congress has approved the work programme and budget for the 2020/21 financial year.   The Association’s highest decision making body also approved a proposal by the Ad-hoc Compensation Committee on allowances and incentives for the President, Vice and Executive Council members.   In accordance with Article 32(l) of the GFA Statutes, Congress appointed Baker Tilly Andah & Andah as the Association’s Auditors for a period of three years.

With Hamilton’s scrimmage against Mantachie getting canceled, the Lions still made the most of their Friday, getting in an intrasquad scrimmage instead.
 “Our defense looked really good. The offense not as much, but this time of the year, that’s usually the case,” Hamilton coach Wade Pierce said. “The defense is usually ahead, especially in the first scrimmage. We wanted to play a game to get the offense a little action, but games getting canceled, that’s just the hand you’re dealt and there’s not a whole lot we can do about it.”
 Hamilton’s scrimmage against Mantachie was canceled due to the Mustangs having positive COVID-19 cases, and the Lions shifted their attention mid-week from preparing for Mantachie to prepping for their Week 1 opponent, Ethel.
 “It’s disappointing we didn’t get to play because we had been looking forward to it, and the kids had been preparing for a while,” Pierce said. “You go preparing for a game, and even though it was just going to be a scrimmage, we were treating it like a game. Now we get longer to prepare for Ethel, which is good in some aspects. It was a let down for the kids, but they adjusted well.”
 Losing the scrimmage also means that the Lions have just one game to use as a tune up for their division opener against West Lowndes on Sept. 11.
 “You hate to say Ethel is a tune up because we want to win and think we have a good shot,” Pierce said. “It’s a tough road to hoe because you have two weeks to correct mistakes and now only one week of preparation to get ready for a good West Lowndes team.”
 D-Line progress
 Pierce said his defensive line shined in the intrasquad scrimmage.
 “Zach Crawford had a great day, and he can be unblockable when he wants to be. Quinn Pounders is solid and has been a force to be reckoned with up front too,” Pierce said. “Grayson Cockerham is a guy that hasn’t played, but he’s probably going to be our starter at free safety and had an interception and looked good back there. Our linebackers look good as well. Sam (Robinson) has a lot of experience, and Josh Harrison is playing it some. Sean Potts is a guy who has really come on in fall camp.”
 Offensively, Hamilton’s running backs have looked strong in fall practice.
 “Rye (Howard) and Josh (Harrison) running the ball have been key for us, and we put Mark Melton back there in the scrimmage and he ran it well,” Pierce said. “Josh is not overly fast, but he is a tough runner. Rye is down right hard to tackle sometimes, and he sees the cutback lanes so well. He had about a 15-yard run in our scrimmage because he cut back across the field and gained that. Even though our running backs won’t be exactly the same as last year, they are going to do well for us.”
 Pierce also expects to throw the ball more than last season.
 “Evan (Pounders) has done really well throwing the ball in preseason, and we have a multitude of receivers like D.J. (Dobbs), Grayson (Cockerham) and Jacob (Imel),” he said. “We are going to try to get some guys in space. That’s kind of our identity we have developed in preseason.”
 Pierce said he doesn’t know what to expect from Ethel, a team that changed coaches in the offseason.
 “I have heard that their new coach Adam Smith, so we know they will be well- coached,” he said. “They have a big tall receiver, so I know they will try to throw the football some. That was a game we won last year, but we didn’t play our best ball. We played poorly and still won the game. The first game of the season though, it’s always the team that’s in the best shape. That’s flat out how it is. It’s hot, and guys will be tired and playing both ways. It will be whoever can gut it out in the fourth quarter.”

 HILLSDALE -- A parole absconder, wanted on outstanding warrants, is once again behind bars pending arraignment today in the 2B District Court on a number of new criminal allegations.
 Jonah Roland Johnston, 43, absconded from parole on May 26, according to the Michigan Department of Corrections Offender Tracking Information System.
 The Hillsdale City Police Department caught up to Johnston early Tuesday morning when officers were dispatched to a report of suspicious activity at Cherry Tree Lane Apartments on the corner of Barr Street and Fayette Street in Hillsdale.
 Officers were initially able to get Johnston into custody and place him in the back of a patrol car after identifying him as an absconder. While they continued their investigation outside the car, Johnston managed to slip his handcuffs to the front and either kicked out or punched out the plexiglass barricade giving him access to the front of the vehicle. He then took off with officers pursuing in other patrol vehicles.
 Johnston went down Barr Street to Spring Street and turned onto Stony Ridge Court--a dead end -- where he went off-road behind a home and crashed the patrol car in a wooded area. He then managed to take off on foot through the woods toward Fairview Avenue and made his way a short distance to a known associate's home in the 100 block of Spring Street where he broke into the home and barricaded himself in the basement with police trailing.
 Officers from the HCPD, Hillsdale County Sheriff's Office, Michigan State Police and Jonesville Police Department converged on the area and surrounded the home before entering with an MSP K-9 unit where they discovered Johnston.
 Chemical agents were deployed to bring Johnston back into custody safely and he was transported to the Hillsdale County Jail.
 Johnston was lodged on the parole absconder charge and an active warrant for possession of methamphetamine and manufacture of methamphetamine.
 He is facing additional charges of fleeing police, unauthorized use of a motor vehicle, destruction of police property, breaking and entering, resisting arrest, a weapons offense and a parole violation.
 Johnston has previous convictions for fleeing police, resisting arrest causing injury and second degree retail fraud out of Lenawee County.
 His parole case stemmed from a 2016 conviction for attempted breaking and entering a building to which he was sentenced to 3-5 years in prison on Feb. 7, 2017.
 In total, Johnston has 15 previous misdemeanors and 10 felony convictions in four separate states.
 No officers were injured during the chain of incidents early Tuesday morning, Police Chief Scott Hephner said.
 Johnston is being held without bond pending arraignment Wednesday.

MOUNT KISCO, N.Y. - A Robert Motherwell (1915-1991) signed acrylic on paper soared to more than eight times its high estimate at The Benefit Shop Foundation's August 26 Red Carpet auction. A buyer new to the auction house took it with a bid of $8,960. Motherwell's signature initials, "RM," were in the lower right corner along with the title of the 30-by-38-inch piece - Untitled Abstract - the subject, an abstract scene in yellow beige and black with large scattered brushstrokes, matted in black and housed in a giltwood frame. Motherwell was an American abstract expressionist painter, printmaker and editor. He was one of the youngest of the New York School, which also included Philip Guston, Willem de Kooning, Jackson Pollock and Mark Rothko. Not far behind at $7,040 against a $100/500 estimate was a signed watercolor on paper after Wayne Thiebaud, a phalanx of oversaturated candy apples, with a signature in the lower right corner that reads "Thiebaud." It measured 7 inches tall by 10 inches wide and was not framed. For information, www.thebenefitshop.org or 914-864-0707.

On the bright side, a steady stream of homes continues to come to market, so at least there’s hope that another good one will be along soon to take away the pain - a change from the drought-like conditions of a year ago.
 The housing market under the dark cloud of Brexit and, soon afterwards, the general election, was less than lovely – I say this from sorry personal experience.
 Back then people were wanting to wait and see how things would play out politically before putting their place on the market. Now everyone’s in a rush to up sticks before the stamp duty holiday comes to an end.
 We finally completed on our sale last week, nearly six months to the day since our offer was accepted.
 Six mad months, including a frozen market, many furloughed estate agents and – hurrah – the absolute blessing that was the stamp duty holiday.
 The latter made the frustratingly prolonged process seem suddenly worth it - and was all the sweeter for the fact that we were initially set to complete in June, a couple of weeks before Rishi’s announcement.
 Here’s hoping for some similar silver linings for the movers who’ve just missed out.

Falling behind in the polls because of his failed leadership, especially in handling the coronavirus pandemic, he uses the tactic that got him elected in 2016: stoking racial and cultural divide. He is desperate to be re-elected to buy time and escape all the lawsuits waiting to be filed against him for all the crimes and transgressions he has committed against the Constitution and the American people.

In my case, I am also the poster child for the lazy do-it-yourselfer who just wants to choose a winning horse, a thoroughbred if possible, stay the course and forget about it most of the time, simply checking occasionally. That’s why I choose index funds for the most part. Indexing and reinvesting is the way to go for people who really don’t have the time, the patience, the gumption and the persuasion to do a full dive.

Levels of interest have been so high locally that the dreaded open house has made something of a comeback - in an appointment-only, pandemic-friendly format, of course. I wrote last week about the back-to-back viewings that had taken place at our rental house, with a solid block of appointments over a four-hour period. Well the same's been happening in sales. Agents are saying they've never seen an August like it and stories of bidding wars continue to abound. One lucky local vendor found themselves with more than 10 offers to choose between - a rarity in any market, particularly one we're constantly being told is about to crash. Amazing news for them, less so for the many disappointed wannabe buyers who found themselves back at square one. On the bright side, a steady stream of homes continues to come to market, so at least there's hope that another good one will be along soon to take away the pain - a change from the drought-like conditions of a year ago. The housing market under the dark cloud of Brexit and, soon afterwards, the general election, was less than lovely - I say this from sorry personal experience. Back then people were wanting to wait and see how things would play out politically before putting their place on the market. Now everyone's in a rush to up sticks before the stamp duty holiday comes to an end. We finally completed on our sale last week, nearly six months to the day since our offer was accepted. Six mad months, including a frozen market, many furloughed estate agents and - hurrah - the absolute blessing that was the stamp duty holiday. The latter made the frustratingly prolonged process seem suddenly worth it - and was all the sweeter for the fact that we were initially set to complete in June, a couple of weeks before Rishi's announcement. Here's hoping for some similar silver linings for the movers who've just missed out.

HILLSDALE -- A parole absconder, wanted on outstanding warrants, is once again behind bars pending arraignment today in the 2B District Court on a number of new criminal allegations.
   
 Jonah Roland Johnston, 43, absconded from parole on May 26, according to the Michigan Department of Corrections Offender Tracking Information System.
   
 The Hillsdale City Police Department caught up to Johnston early Tuesday morning when officers were dispatched to a report of suspicious activity at Cherry Tree Lane Apartments on the corner of Barr Street and Fayette Street in Hillsdale.
   
 Officers were initially able to get Johnston into custody and place him in the back of a patrol car after identifying him as an absconder. While they continued their investigation outside the car, Johnston managed to slip his handcuffs to the front and either kicked out or punched out the plexiglass barricade giving him access to the front of the vehicle. He then took off with officers pursuing in other patrol vehicles.
   
 Johnston went down Barr Street to Spring Street and turned onto Stony Ridge Court--a dead end -- where he went off-road behind a home and crashed the patrol car in a wooded area. He then managed to take off on foot through the woods toward Fairview Avenue and made his way a short distance to a known associate's home in the 100 block of Spring Street where he broke into the home and barricaded himself in the basement with police trailing.
   
 Officers from the HCPD, Hillsdale County Sheriff's Office, Michigan State Police and Jonesville Police Department converged on the area and surrounded the home before entering with an MSP K-9 unit where they discovered Johnston.
   
 Chemical agents were deployed to bring Johnston back into custody safely and he was transported to the Hillsdale County Jail.
   
 Johnston was lodged on the parole absconder charge and an active warrant for possession of methamphetamine and manufacture of methamphetamine.
   
 He is facing additional charges of fleeing police, unauthorized use of a motor vehicle, destruction of police property, breaking and entering, resisting arrest, a weapons offense and a parole violation.
   
 Johnston has previous convictions for fleeing police, resisting arrest causing injury and second degree retail fraud out of Lenawee County.
   
 His parole case stemmed from a 2016 conviction for attempted breaking and entering a building to which he was sentenced to 3-5 years in prison on Feb. 7, 2017.
   
 In total, Johnston has 15 previous misdemeanors and 10 felony convictions in four separate states.
   
 No officers were injured during the chain of incidents early Tuesday morning, Police Chief Scott Hephner said.
   
 Johnston is being held without bond pending arraignment Wednesday.
