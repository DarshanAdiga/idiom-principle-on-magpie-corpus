The Miami Heat reached deals Saturday with two players from their NBA Finals squad, signing center/forward Bam Adebayo to the richest deal in franchise history, while also coming to terms on a one-year deal with veteran forward Udonis Haslem.
 Adebayo, 23, officially agreed to a five-year, $163 million deal with escalator clauses that could take it has high as $195 million, multiple outlets reported. Escalators include earning a spot on the All-NBA team, or earning an MVP or defensive player of the year in the upcoming season.
 The deal tops the previous high when Jimmy Butler signed a $141 million pact with the team.
 "One of the most important things a franchise can do is to make sure that your best, youngest, cornerstone players sign on the dotted line," Heat president Pat Riley said in a statement. "Getting Bam his extension was a no-brainer for us because we know he will be around for years to come. That's great for the Heat, great for the fans and great for Bam."
 Adebayo will make $5.1 million in the upcoming season on the final year of his rookie deal before his season-salary jumps north of $28 million for the 2021-22 season.
 Adebayo had a breakout 2019-20 season when he averaged 15.9 points with 10.2 rebounds and 5.1 assists. He was even better in the playoffs with 17.8 points and 10.3 rebounds, while adding 4.4 assists in 19 of the team's 21 playoff games.
 The Heat fell just short of an NBA title this past season, losing to the Los Angeles Lakers during a six-game Finals series.
 Miami re-signed Haslem to a $2.6 million veteran minimum deal, according to the Miami Herald. The deal means the 40-year-old will return for his 18th season, all of them with the Heat.
 Haslem scored 3.0 points with 4.0 rebounds in just four games this past season and is valued more for his leadership skills. In 858 career games, Haslem has averaged 7.6 points with 4.8 rebounds and is the franchise's all-time leading rebounder with 5,754 boards.

Irish Illustrated’s Tim Prister broke a pair of too-close-for-comfort injury stories last week with news that both center Jarrett Patterson, and the man to his right, fifth-year senior guard Tommy Kraemer, would miss Friday’s contest—and in Patterson’s case—the remainder of the season, due to surgeries. Irish head coach Bryan Kelly confirmed those realities this week, adding a dose of good fortune accompanying the latter. Patterson is out. He had foot surgery. It went very well. He’ll recover and do extremely well,” said Kelly. “We’ll have him back obviously next year. Disappointed in him. He was having a great season. But again, I think he’ll do quite well from this surgery.

This summer, Joe Jonas and Sophie Turner welcomed their first baby together, a daughter named Willa.
 "Joe and Sophie welcomed a baby girl last Wednesday in L.A. and are over the moon," a source told _Entertainment Tonight_ at the time. "The couple is already obsessed and can't stop gloating about their new addition. The couple is taking time to enjoy this special moment and have only shared the news and updates with family and friends. With the pandemic Joe and Sophie have been very cautious about who is around them and their little girl."
 Willa is only four months old, but her parents are already convinced they want more kids, a source told _Us Weekly_.
 "Joe and Sophie are already trying to have another baby," a source told _Us Weekly_. "They are really excited to expand their family. Having the baby has made them really close and want to have a large family together."
 Jonas and Turner got married in 2019, and just over a year later, they welcomed Willa into their family.
 "I feel like the only thing that's changed for me is having this incredible sense of security," she told _E_ _LLE_ in March of this year. "Just the word _husband_ and the word _wife_ --it just solidifies the relationship. I love being married. I think it's wonderful. I'm sure we'll have our hiccups and our different things. But right now, it's like the security and the safety is everything."
 She also gushed about her husband: "With Joe, I always felt like I was the one who was punching, like, way above my league. And I still feel like that," Turner says. "He's so handsome, talented, funny, charismatic. I'm really lucky to be with him and have someone like him want to be around me and spend time with me."
