Every time someone tests positive for COVID-19 in Gila County, health workers talk to an average of four of their “close contacts” trying to keep the infection from spreading.
 Health officials say that has limited the number of confirmed cases in Gila County to 11 as of April 23. But health officials know that they have the resources to talk to just a fraction of the people those carrying the virus might have encountered.
 Studies suggest half of those infected may never show significant symptoms, but can still spread the virus.
 In Gila County, a dogged band of disease detectives has tackled a virus that has all but shut down the U.S. economy. In Arizona, it has so far infected 6,716 people and caused at least 275 deaths, as of April 27.
 Health experts have warned that locating, testing and isolating contacts with known cases in the weeks it can take symptoms to develop remains the key to containing the virus.
 A comprehensive contact tracing system can slow the spread of a quick- spreading virus like COVID-19 — something Josh Beck, who runs point on Gila County’s response to COVID-19, understands.
 “The name of the game is to identify and isolate: this is how we stop a disease from spreading,” he said.
 Contact testing programs attempt to cope with “super spreaders,” those who can spread the virus quickly. One Italian played that role when he went to the office, played soccer, attended dinner parties and watched an opera. He spread the disease everywhere. Contact tracing determined just how far.
 The Gila County Health and Emergency Management department uses a practiced method to contact those who might be infected.
 “Our investigators have learned lessons from contact tracing sexually transmitted diseases such as HIV and syphilis, to speak to people in a way that’s not stigmatizing and will encourage them to get on board with the request to self-isolate or share their contacts,” said Beck.
 Information provided by the Gila County Health and Emergency Management Department shows his department has investigated 164 potential cases, but the department will not talk to close contacts until the patient tests positive.
 The symptoms of 103 of those 164 potential cases stimulated health workers to isolate them while awaiting test results — which can take days.
 As of April 22, Gila County health workers had talked to 43 close contacts of the 11 people who tested positive — roughly four close contacts for each positive test.
 How does the county’s health department define close contact?
 It depends on the level of risk from the contact, said Beck. Mostly, that means the close contact spent more than an hour in range of a person with symptoms, like a cough.
 This could prompt health officials to request the person exposed to self- quarantine for 14 days, pending return of a test. The same contact with someone who had mild symptoms might result in a request to “self-monitor symptoms.”
 Beck said, “What is important is to determine who is an at-risk contact.”
 The Centers for Disease Control currently defines a close contact as those from the same household, intimate partners, caregivers and “anyone who has had close contact (6 feet or closer) ‘for a prolonged amount of time.’”
 “If the patient who tested positive had symptoms like coughing or if they were wearing a mask which can block some respiratory droplets, these things also affect risk level,” said Beck.

Zimbabwe: Nurses Cry Foul Over Scrapping of Flexi Hours

River Phillips struggled against pitchers who threw from different arm slots.
 So, the slugger figured he needed to incorporate that into his pitching style.
 “When I saw a pitcher throwing submarine, it messed me up,” he said. “I figured I should do that so I could be just as effective.”
 So he added a variety of angles to his straight-over-the-top form during his sophomore season on the Payson High varsity baseball team. And he really excelled on the mound as a starter and reliever for the Longhorns.
 He’s got a nasty slider that baffles hitters coming from the same arm position he throws his fastball from.
 “It messes with their heads because they think I’ll throw a fastball,” he said. “I can throw a lot of different pitches at different arm angles. That has had a lot to do with my success.”
 He played a key role on the mound and at the plate in helping the Longhorns win their second outright 3A East Region championship in three years (they won it in 2017 and 2019 and shared it in 2018).
 He led Payson pitchers in innings pitched, appearances, wins and strikeouts in 2019. He started and served as the closer out of the bullpen. He welcomed the stressful late-innings situations others can’t handle.
 “Games start out pretty slow and my mind works fast, so I feel more comfortable closing,” he said. “I like inheriting pressure.”
 Phillips and his teammates were gearing up for another region title bid and a deep run in the state tournament when the COVID-19 pandemic shut down the season.
 “It was heartbreaking,” he said.
 He wants to play baseball on the collegiate level and hoped to get noticed this spring.
 “It just tears me apart that he doesn’t get a chance to catch the attention of college coaches,” said Payson High baseball coach Brian Young. “But I know that won’t hold him back from getting his chance, which is all he really needs.”
 Young believes Phillips and the eight other seniors on this year’s team have benefited from their years on the diamond.
 “This is where the character they have developed through their years of playing really defines them more than the outcome on the field,” the coach said. “I’m proud of all of our guys and how they have handled this.”
 Phillips isn’t letting COVID-19 kill his dreams. He sent a video of his highlights to coaches at Central Arizona College in Casa Grande. He hopes to earn a spot on the roster with his mid-80s fastball, wipeout slider and sidearm angles.
 “He is so tough because he mixes his arm angles and throws so many variations of pitches,” Young said. “It’s hard to have a comfortable at bat against a pitcher like him.”
 Losing a season of chances to get the attention of college coaches is frustrating. But the worst part about the shutdown is that he’ll never play with his buddies again.
 “Every time I stepped on the field I had a great time with all those boys,” he said. “We had a bond. I was always smiling.
 “Winning games with guys I played baseball with my whole life means more than winning with guys you don’t really know. You feel more satisfied when you win with your best friends. I’ve played with these guys my whole life.”

In any case, the switch from Odom to Drinkwitz could not have gone over well with the team’s players, who fought for Odom to keep his job. Now, they’ll be led by a 36-year old coach with one year of head coaching experience, who was making the transition from coordinating a high school offense to doing quality control for Auburn a decade ago at this time. And while Drinkwitz has risen rapidly through the coaching ranks, his accomplishments as the offensive coordinator of Boise State and NC State don’t jump off the page, and most of the players featuring in last year’s 12-win App State campaign were recruited by current Louisville coach Scott Satterfield. If the bar at Mizzou is putting together nine or ten-win seasons, I don’t see Drinkwitz being the coach to put them over the top in an intense conference.

Michigan State can’t keep up resource-wise with Ohio State and Penn State, and if archrival Michigan figures things out, we’re looking at third or fourth in the Big Ten East being the program’s ceiling. That makes it all the more impressive that the Spartans lured Tucker away from Colorado, but it also means their 11-win days are over. Context considered, I’ll give high marks for the hire.

Conspiracy theories appear to become particularly prevalent in times of crisis “when the state appears powerless over whatever it is trying to manage”, says Hill, and coronavirus provided a “perfect storm”. An earlier example might have included 9/11 when, again, conspiracy theories were commonplace. They arise, adds Hill, because for some people “they provide reassurance that there is a structure to the world and that someone one is behind it [all], no matter how evil or benevolent they are.” In a nutshell, “truth-seekers” are constructing a way of making sense of the world when faced with sudden and unprecedented threats, one that avoids the randomness of life.

 Science says man is a social animal. God says, and He said it first, It is not good for man to be alone.
   
 The folks who are worried about the health of the nation say for us to isolate ourselves.
   
 There is tension.
   
 Even if it weren't for the economy, if it weren't for restaurants closing down, if it weren't for stores closing, if it weren't for the retirement account (OH NO, she's gone, she's gone), we would still be yearning to reopen the world because we--as humans--yearn to be around other humans.
   
 We need the voices, we need the faces, we need to be able to touch, to smell (I'm thinking of you Joe Biden). We need to be physically present with people.
   
 I've been in Microsoft Teams meetings on a more than weekly basis. If you have the software, you can schedule them on your Outlook Calendar. While they are set for a particular time, you can show up early and visit with people before the meeting, just like regular meetings. And we do show up early. We need to see faces; we need to hear voices; even of people who we "just work with."
   
 I've a couple of groups I meet with on a regular basis, one for Bible study and one to study secular books. We've set them up to meet over Zoom. These groups have continued in their particular ways. We've held the groups together, preserved their continuity, kept the fire alive, continued spinning the thread.
   
 And we keep up with each other.
   
 But it's not the same as face to face.
   
 I've noticed something about meeting online. We tend to stray from the topic less. There are fewer political digressions; there are fewer humorous asides. We tick our way down the agenda and get the work done. What used to take an hour and ten minutes can now be done in 30. Then we click off the screen and retreat back into the isolation of our own homes, our own offices, our own heads.
   
 Fighting to get outside of ourselves is a battle we all fight. I am an introvert by nature, but I still recognize the need for other people. The mythological symbol for Man freeing himself from his Mother is a battle with a Dragon, but that battle is manifest in many ways. We are expulsed from the womb and we cry, missing that warm isolation. But those of us who go on to be healthy individuals continually fight to break barriers to go further in the world. While we will always want and need the warmth of a home, having tasted the wider world, having found Others in the world we've grown fond of, we miss our sojourns out of our homes.
   
 My back is better. I've lost the weight that I aimed to lose, and I can walk without pain now. I can walk out into our beautiful--now empty--world. I do see people out. We keep our distance. I raise my hand in the Vulcan salute of "Live long and prosper" and those who get it, smile back at me...from a distance.
   
 We are not meant to be alone. Like God said. Like Jewel said, "You were meant for me, and I was meant for you."

Even if the Sun Devils are able to stay in games and have a high-character team under Edwards, they’re going nowhere in the Pac-12 if they can’t put up points. And in this day and age of college football, you simply can’t hire a proven offensive innovator without giving him the title of ‘Head Coach’ to match, making it highly doubtful ASU will be able to keep pace offensively in the Pac-12.”

You've done it. I've done it. Everyone has had one of those cringe-inducing moments when we have spoken without thoroughly considering the impact our words. When the mistake is realized, we usually apologize or laugh at our momentary lapse of good judgment.
   
 The difference being few of us have our every word recorded, televised and dissected for hours on end following a slip of the tongue or confusion over the information we were passing along. Of even more importance, our every word doesn't carry the weight of that conferred on a world leader.
   
 In my opinion it's obvious when any president is speaking from a script/teleprompter. Contributions by speechwriters are carefully worded; ideas thoughtfully crafted and language, phrasing seem written with an eye to future historical citations.
   
 With all due respect, that difference is never more obvious than when President Trump strays from prepared texts, in the free-wheeling, stream of consciousness that typify his extemporaneous remarks. That has become part of the appeal to his most ardent fans. No flowery rhetoric. No elitist oratory. No concessions to "political correctness". Just shoot-from-the-hip, straight talk frequently laced with the kind of profane observations usually reserved for locker rooms, a neighborhood bar or the privacy of one's home.
   
 In the context of boisterous rallies or when "ambushed" by an often combative, barrage of reporter's rapid-fire interrogation on route to a waiting car or helicopter, those comments don't carry the weighty import of a formal, fact finding briefing from a White House podium, surrounded by prepared charts, graphs and statements from experts.
   
 I am certainly not a great supporter nor fan of the current occupant of the White House but rather than depend on the filter of either "main-stream" or "alt-right" media reporting, many of hundreds of opinion pieces or a torrent of social media comments, I try to base opinions on first-hand observation when possible.
   
 For that reason, I chose to watch the entirety of the televised "briefings" that began after the shutdown of the president's public appearances in consideration for his well-being. So it was, I observed not only those now infamous comments regarding disinfectants and UV light exposure that have caused a furor in the past few days, but also in the context of and including the preceding statements of the others participating in the briefing.
   
 No, it obviously wasn't sarcasm. No, it wasn't a dictate to the public. Just a spontaneous albeit, ill-advised musing as to possible implications of new test findings.
   
 The objection I have is to the follow-up "denial" that actually does put the president in a bad light. There is no sin in owning up to a momentary lapse in judgment. There is no harm in admitting to a bad decision. If acknowledged, there can be forgiveness for insulting, undeserved criticism of others made in the heat of the moment.
   
 Honesty, as always, is the best policy.

The Stoughton Recreation Department stepped up its game virtually to meet the town's needs for activities, according to Director Matt Cauchon.
 "A majority of people are staying engaged virtually, so we are trying to offer as much as we can online," he said. "The Rec Center plays such a big part in the town, and we have been receiving great feedback so far."
 One of the most popular activities has been lectures for senior citizens.
 "Mass Audubon has been doing a nature walk lecture series for us," he said. "One has been on the life of owls, where a biologist shows slides. Another is on birding in your backyard."
 For teens, a new activity that has sparked growing interest is a cooking class. The department also is working on craft ideas.
 Online learning offers residents of all ages a chance to explore a variety of activities, which Cauchon said he hopes will carry over once the center is able to open again.
 "One of our goals right now is to offer a lot of one-time workshops at different times," he said. "Our typical programs last about four to five weeks. This way, people can learn a new skill and build their confidence. They can always take additional courses and come to the rec center as well."
 Cauchon credited Molly Reid, the program facilitator, for coming up with inventive ideas, particularly for the children's programs.
 "For one broadcast, she did a slime-making workshop, which was a big hit," he said. "Another one was to make play dough. The goal was to make things from everyday household items so parents wouldn't have to go out."
 One popular activity is a Stoughton-themed board game that was designed by the department. And to celebrate Easter, wooden bunnies were placed around town for kids to take pictures of and post as part of a scavenger hunt.
 "Kids have been sending pictures of them playing the board game," Cauchon said. "It really creates a sense of community. It's a really cool idea."
 The Recreation Department team of Reid, Felica Baptista and Steph Patton all have added to the programs.
 An upcoming town event Cauchon promoted is the 5K race in honor of the four Stoughton High School students who were killed in a 2018 car crash.
 "Unfortunately, the race won't be able to be held," he said. "But we've decided to hold it virtually. There are eight sponsors who have already donated, and 300 people who have signed up. It's been gaining a lot of traction. It's a really cool way of keeping the race alive."
 People can send in their running times to the Recreation Center up until May 31, according to Cauchon. For more information about the department, go to stoughtonrec.org.
 All the money raised will go to the disaster relief fund and a scholarship fund for the high school.
 "Stoughton is a really strong community," Cauchon said. "I know it's a really stressful time. At the end of the day, my goal is to do whatever I can for this community."

The U.S. death toll from COVID-19 surpassed more than 50,000 people this weekend, and on Monday night the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases neared one million, according to John Hopkins University.
 The ad also highlights the more than 26 million Americans who have filed for unemployment in recent weeks. By Monday evening, more than a million people had filed for unemployment in Michigan as a result of COVID-19, according to the state's Unemployment Insurance Agency, and more than 1.6 million did so in Pennsylvania, according to the state's official website. Updated unemployment numbers for Wisconsin were not immediately available on Monday.
 The Democratic group pledged to spend $65 million on ads aimed at Mr. Trump and it has already targeted the recent public health response with $10 million, according to the group.

This hire was a stunning one at the time, with Fisher receiving the biggest contract in college athletics history, a 10-year, $80 million megadeal with $75 million guaranteed.

And what a hire they made, poaching a sitting head coach with six ten-win campaigns in eight years and a national championship from his seemingly better gig at Florida State.

Petersen, a unanimously loved figure, was never going to step away without leaving Washington in good hands, and with Lake, the coaching transition should go about as smooth as possible. It was only a matter of time before the 43-year old former DC got a head gig, and Petersen will remain with the team in a less-demanding advisory role. Lake has kept the 2020 recruiting class extremely strong - 15th in the country according to 247Sports - and five-star 2021 QB Sam Huard has stayed on board as well. Washington averaged 10 wins in Petersen’s four most recent seasons, and with Lake, there should be no drop- off and the Huskies should remain outside contenders for the College Football Playoff long-term. The only knock against Lake might be that he’s never been a head coach, but if Petersen had to leave, you’d be hard-pressed to find a better replacement.

Oh, how I hated this hire. Todd Graham’s ASU was rarely excellent, posting two ten-win seasons and four other mediocre campaigns. One could argue he should have been cut loose, but subsequently hiring Edwards made next-to-no sense at the time. This was a 63-year old that had been out of coaching for a decade, hadn’t coached college since ‘89, and knew defense. I wasn’t alone in questioning if Edwards would have the energy to recruit and tinker to the degree necessary to help the Sun Devils contend for the Pac-12 title.

Heck, they did that while starting a true freshman at quarterback, the talented Jayden Daniels. Edwards has recruited fairly well, too. I worry about the team’s ceiling - folks seem all too willing to heap praise on Herm for 8-5 in a poor conference - but he’s made a lot of doubters at least shut their mouths for the time being.

To fight against novel coronavirus with authentic information, Central University of Punjab, Bathinda (CUPB) has launched a unique COVID-19 information web portal, which it claims has most of the authentic information, and sources for references, research and an understanding of the phenomenon.

 “CUPB COVID-19 information portal will be updated automatically, which will provide authentic information and official resources related to global COVID-19 updates, India COVID-19 dashboard, health guidelines issued by WHO and other agencies, COVID-19 research funding, details of PM-CARES Fund and other essential information, which can be accessed by visiting https://cupcovid19.info,” he said.
 “During the ongoing crisis, people are not only struggling to fight the pandemic but also an infodemic due to ample amount of verified and unverified information related to COVID-19 available on the Internet. This portal is an attempt to compile the vast and scattered up to date relevant information on a single platform to facilitate the researchers and students as well as the common man. This portal would serve as a gateway for exploring research funding, research publications, global updates, government announcements, and the best strategies to beat COVID-19,” Mr. Kohli said.

The final thing that’s definitely worth touching on is how home and road games are decided. Assuming a Tier 1 or 2 team uses both of their open dates to schedule low-level opponents at home, that leaves nine remaining games (determined by the lottery) to try and get to any athletic director’s golden number of seven home games during the course of the season. As it would play out, maybe the lottery could determine who is home and away for each team’s first few draws, and then some wizard programming could allocate home or away for the remainder of games to get to either four or five home games from the draw for each team. Throwing around suggestions, Elsass mentions home field advantage potentially going to whichever team is ranked higher or willing to pay more, and the possibility of a neutral scheduling czar dictating who is home and away and how much money is being exchanged.

That one-point Mississippi State Egg Bowl win also had implications for the state’s other FBS head coach, Moorhead. School officials had discussed terminating the former Penn State offensive coordinator if he lost to Ole Miss, but the narrow win seemed like it would buy Moorhead another season. A bowl game loss to Louisville coupled with a fight in practice that Moorhead tried to downplay led to his dismissal. Ole Miss and Mississippi State will always be inextricably linked and occupy a similar role in the college football pecking order, and it’s hard not to feel like Moorhead did a better job than his counterpart Matt Luke in two years, going 8-5 before regressing to 6-7 in 2019. Still, folks in Starkville felt Moorhead hadn’t done enough with a talented 2018 roster and wasn’t a cultural fit for the Deep South.

An imprint can make you act illogically and it can make you believe things that aren’t true. That’s because imprints aren’t based on your current reality. They come from a past moment or a past reality (or your perception of a past reality). You can grow out of them, but if you hang on to them, they keep you acting from an old place. They can hold you back from growth and stepping into the now of your life.
 Imagine two people walking down the street together at night. They are both in exactly the same environment and are both at exactly the same risk of danger. Yet, one of them feels safe because, as a child, she got a lot of attention and reassurance and is imprinted with a feeling of security. The other doesn’t feel safe because, as a child, he was often put in precarious situations and he didn’t feel protected, so he was imprinted with a sense that life is dangerous.
 Maybe these two people were safe and maybe they were in danger, but neither one of them is perceiving the present moment because they are both operating under the influence of imprints.
 When you respond to the right-now based on the before, you cannot ever really exist in the right-now. Imprints may be affecting how you deal (or don’t deal) with what happens to you in life, how you think about things, and how you see yourself when you look in the mirror.

Devlin suffered a season-ending neck injury in 2019, and New England immediately seemed to struggle in the running game. Sony Michel, for example, regressed from 4.5 yards per carry in 2018 to 3.7 yards per carry in 2019. There were a number of factors which contributed to that decline, but there is no doubt that Develin was one of them.

This is a tricky one. It was easy to write off Michigan State’s 3-9 2016 season, which came right after Mark Dantonio incredibly produced five 11-win seasons in six years. The next season, Michigan State posted 10 wins and finished 15th in the AP Poll. But all was not well in East Lansing, as the Spartans then struggled to back-to-back 7-6 campaigns while stuck in the Big Ten East with Ohio State and a resurgent Penn State. Leave no doubt: Dantonio was going to further complicate his legacy as MSU failed to contend again in 2020. He couldn’t keep pace recruiting, and questionable assistant coaching moves further compounded the team’s issues. But Dantonio, who had the job for as long as he wanted, thought he wanted another shot in 2020. A lawsuit regarding recruiting violations probably pushed Dantonio off of the fence, and he stepped down from his role in early February, leaving Sparty high and dry after the coaching carousel had run its course.

The halt on film and TV shoots has meant that people are not getting to see new episodes of ongoing shows. This has meant that channels are showing old shows once again. Star Plus' again showing the mythological saga, Mahabharat and it has got a good response. Actress Pooja B Sharma who made her debut in the TV industry with the show has spoken about the cheer-haran sequence. She said that it took 20 days to shoot. Pooja Sharma told SpotboyE, "The cheer- haran scene was shot for 20 days. I won't say that shooting for it was difficult- because the ground work had been very well done by the writers of the show. I mean, that sequence was written so sensitively that there was not a single weak moment for me. I just had to feel the emotion written on paper. So yeah, it was not difficult."

To give your skin a glowy pick-me-up, use azelaic acid. “In lieu of a scrub or polish, naturally derived acids like azelaic will penetrate pores and dissolve impurities,” explains licensed esthetician Elizabeth Donat. This assists your skin’s natural cell turnover rate, helping remove dead skin cells that otherwise accumulate and contribute to a lackluster complexion.
 Furthermore, azelaic acid increases collagen and elastin deposits in the top layer of the skin. This is a noteworthy effect, as both collagen and elastin are needed to keep your skin healthy and resilient. And, get this: While azelaic acid suppresses overactive sebaceous glands, it _also_increases sebum secretion in super dry areas—which boosts the skin’s natural hydration and reduces dullness. Essentially, if your sebaceous glands are out of whack, azelaic acid will help normalize them.

Searching for a new spot to hike recently led to a wonderful discovery west of Payson.
 With many developed trailheads closed and looking for something outside the popular Payson Area Trail System (PATS), we set off down Main Street to the City Creek trailhead, near the Doll Baby Ranch.
 While I have lived in Payson for 11 years, and driven by the City Creek trailhead a handful of times, I have never ventured out on the trail, which I assumed was too rugged and difficult.
 After parking at the well marked City Creek trailhead, we crossed the road and headed south a short distance to an opening in the fence line, which marks the entrance. There is a large, yellow sign at the entrance warning that the area was damaged by a wildfire and to be aware of loose rocks, falling trees and flash floods (If you look on the back of this sign, there is an Arizona Trail sticker).
 We continued to City Creek, which this time of year is flowing. After bolder hopping across the creek, we followed a narrow trail up along the side of the ridge. The trail gradually climbs. And climbs. Flowers quickly distracted me from the elevation change. There were clusters of yellow ragwort, pale purple thistles, white flowers that looked like daises, paper-thin white buds on mariposa lilies and grape colored wild hyacinths. I stopped every dozen feet or so to capture a new flower on my camera.
 When I wasn’t looking down at flowers, the stupendous views slowed my progress.
 Luckily, I wasn’t tripping over rocks as the narrow trail is well maintained.
 The Mazatzal Divide Trail continues about 5.75 miles where it intersects with the Arizona Trail. We knew we didn’t have the daylight or the stamina to reach the Arizona Trail, so we settled on hiking two miles and turning around.
 Connie Cockrell, with the Payson Packers, wrote that their group generally hikes 2.4 miles to the top of a ridge where there are awesome 360-degree views.
 After breaking for a snack at two miles, we went back to the trailhead the way we came in.
 The best part: we didn’t see another person. There were no vehicles in the parking lot and the closest visitor we figured was a bear, who had left some scat on the trail maybe a few days earlier.

We’re all thrilled to see Gangetic dolphins emerge again in Bihar’s Vikramshila Gangetic Dolphin Sanctuary. Birding enthusiasts are recording rare sightings, and wild elephants are apparently strutting about in Kerala’s towns. Many of these clips are fake, but some are true, and we believe all is well with our wildlife. But think again.
 If the global pandemic raging today should teach us anything, it is to treat the Earth with care and realise human actions are to blame for the ongoing crisis. Perhaps it is something only a handful of us have realised. And the agency that should have woken up first, the government, has stayed wilfully asleep. Instead of concentrating on vaccines or PPE or migrant relief, the government has quietly been making inroads into the forests.
 The National Board for Wildlife (NBWL) has approved a slew of wildlife clearances for ‘developmental’ projects across the country even as the country is in lockdown mode.
 Mind you, the NBWL has not met for the last six years. According to a report in downtoearth.org, it has a Standing Committee that issues policy decisions and clearances. Then, in early April, the said Standing Committee decided to host its first-ever video-conference meet – chaired by Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar. And the meet was held expressly to grant these clearances. Why during a health emergency? Your guess is as good as mine.
 An earlier report in _The Hindu_ quotes an expert who was privy to the process saying, on condition of anonymity, that it is difficult to scrutinise maps on a video call that will show the exact location of the proposed projects. “There was also no occasion to ask questions of officials for clarifications,” the expert adds. The cleared projects include, among others, a highway construction in Goa (which passes through the Mollem Wildlife Sanctuary), the Nagpur-Mumbai superhighway (over 32,000 trees will be felled and the proposed design passes through 48 villages), and a railway bridge in Madhya Pradesh and Telangana (through the Kawal tiger corridor).

Projections about how COVID-19 will play out are speculative, but the end game will most likely involve a mix of everything that checked past pandemics: Continued social-control measures to buy time, new antiviral medications to ease symptoms, and a vaccine. The exact formula--how long control measures such as social distancing must stay in place, for instance--depends in large part on how strictly people obey restrictions and how effectively governments respond. For example, containment measures that worked for COVID-19 in places such as Hong Kong and South Korea came far too late in Europe and the U.S. "The question of how the pandemic plays out is at least 50 percent social and political," Cobey says.

Mention ‘Bonosree’ to Assamese Gen Z and they are sure to burst out in laughter. For the uninitiated, Bonosree is not another version of the famous ‘Raku Da’ (Rajkumar Thakuria) who is everyone’s go-to option for memes. Bonosree, instead, is a character to whom all Assamese and non-Assamese who have resided in any part of Assam will relate. Her creator, Vishal Langthasa, is a Dimasa boy from the northeast’s Assam’s Haflong district.
 The mention of Bonosree makes Vishal chuckle. After creating Bonosree for the Assamese YouTube fans, Vishal wanted to create a relatable character for the rest of the non-Assamese people of northeast. “Thus came Nijula or aunt Nijula who holds nothing back when it comes to reacting or criticising people. Nijula’s character, when closely observed, is the typical neighbourhood woman who will not think twice before putting you in an awkward situation,” laughs 28-year-old Vishal whose YouTube channel Chugli TV has more than 113,000 subscribers.
