How that equipment is being utilized, however, is doing more harm than good, according to Hackett, with dotted lines to determine an offside causing particular concern. &quot;With the Bamford scenario, you don&#39;t want a law that acts as a defender, helping to rule out goals,&quot; he said. &quot;Do away with the lines, and leave it in the hands of a well-trained VAR, as they do in the MLS. They don&#39;t have many controversies over there. Why are we making it too complex? The law has to change on offside. Give the benefit of the doubt to the attacker, rather than the defender, and write the law to accommodate that. If that means daylight between last defender and attacker then so be it.&quot;

FIFA, in fact, only allows three &quot;elite&quot; referees from each individual country. &quot;It is run like an old boys’ club now,&quot; Hackett added. There is no accountability... These guys are not amateurs, they are getting six-figure wages – you have to deliver. &quot;They are producing better referees in Europe.
