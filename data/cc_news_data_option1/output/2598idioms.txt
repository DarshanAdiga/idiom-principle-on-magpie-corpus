As a long time owner of a vacation rental property in Destin, I am saddened to see the beach chair rental companies taking over the best seating on our beautiful beaches.
   
 I am able to have sold-out dates on my rental calendar because potential rentals can see on my webpage my close proximity to those beautiful emerald waters. Imagine how frustrated they must be on their first day to the beach when they discover they must take a back seat to the plethora of rental beach chairs!
   
 We must all learn to share -- isn't that what we teach our children?
   
 Surely there could be a fair compromise between the rental companies and homeowners. Let's work together on this issue. We have all been cooped up for so long, and we all should be able to sit on the beach without hindrance of a view!

 COVID-19 heralds some good news for this Independence Day. We won't be facing heavy traffic. And, the scarcity of meat will keep our outdoor grills safe.
   
 Folks who grill hamburgers and hot dogs face a nasty choice. The U.S. Meat and Poultry Hotline advises grilling at high temperature to avoid food poisoning by E. coli and Salmo-nella bacteria. But the National Cancer Institute warns that high-temperature grilling of processed meats generates cancer-causing compounds.
   
 Fortunately, we no longer need to choose between food poisoning and cancer!
   
 A bunch of enterprising U.S. food processors have met this challenge head-on by developing a rich variety of convenient, healthful, delicious plant-based veggie burgers, veggie dogs, and soy nuggets.
   
 These products don't harbor nasty bugs or cancer-causing com-pounds. They are missing the cholesterol, saturated fats, drugs, hormones, and pesticides of their animal-based alternatives. And, they are waiting for us in the frozen food section of our favorite supermarket, along with nut-based ice creams, and other dairy-free des-serts.
   
 On this Independence Day, let's declare our independence from the meat industry, which exposes its workers to COVID infection. And, let's stay away from both the COVID and the barbecue bugs!

Children are especially at risk when it comes to fireworks. One-third of the fireworks injuries sustained in Massachusetts last year were to children 15 and younger.
 Even something as seemingly innocent as sparklers can be dangerous.
 Consider this: Water boils at 212 degrees. Wood burns at 575 degrees. Glass melts at 900 degrees. But sparklers burn at over 1,200 degrees.
 That does not seem like something you want a child holding.
 Indeed, sparklers were a major cause of injuries for young children, accounting for more than half of total injuries among those under age 5, according to the Consumer Product Safety Commission.
 “At those high temperatures, within two to three seconds a child can sustain what we call a ‘full thickness’ third-degree burn down to the bone,” Dr. Sarah Combs, an emergency room doctor from Children’s National Medical Center in Washington, D.C., told the publication Live Science.
 Fireworks can also lead to fires.
 Last June, a building caught fire in Plainville after fireworks were thrown down the chute of a trash compactor. Another one in Boston displaced 20 people and caused $700,000 in damage.
 “Once the fireworks are set off you don’t know where they are going to land. They can land on a roof or in somebody’s yard,” North Attleboro Fire Chief Chris Coleman said.
 Despite all the unrest, the nation should celebrate its status as the world’s longest-running democracy. But please celebrate safely — and without fireworks.

In 2003, the U.S. put a $25 million bounty on Saddam Hussein, and $15 million apiece for his two sons. (The $30 million reward for Odai and Qusai Hussein went to a tipster whose information led U.S. troops to their hideout, where the brothers were killed in a gunbattle.)

During last year's trial on the men's bid for his assets, experts for the plaintiffs including a former Drug Enforcement Administration agent claimed Lopez had only indirect ties to the guerrillas through his friendship with El Aissami, who U.S. officials have long believed assisted the FARC in moving cocaine through Venezuela.

While a phased approach for students returning to school is in full swing, and normal attendance resuming from September, there is still a large emphasis on the role of technology and the use of resources and services to help children continue learning - regardless of whether we have a second wave or shift to blended learning approaches more permanently in the future. However, if that is the case, while we welcome any resource that helps provide teachers with a credible and structured source of content, what we're failing to address is the live, synchronous element of teaching and learning. We must also consider _what_ you do with the content, _how_ you integrate it to meet school and individual learner needs, and _how_ you bring it to life through live teaching.

Raheem Sterling said Manchester City proved a point in a 4-0 thrashing of newly-crowned Premier League champions Liverpool on Thursday as they look to take the title back next season.
 Sterling scored in a competitive match against his old club for the first time and also had a major part in two other goals as City inflicted just Liverpool’s third league defeat in two seasons in emphatic fashion.
 Kevin De Bruyne opened the scoring from the penalty spot after Sterling was wrestled to the ground by Joe Gomez.
 Sterling and Phil Foden then made it 3-0 before half-time and Alex Oxlade- Chamberlain could only turn Sterling’s shot into his own net to round off the scoring in the second half.
 “We had a test against the current champions to make a point and we did brilliant,” said Sterling. “Next season started today and we did well.”
 City boss Pep Guardiola is hoping the manner of the victory can spur his side on to finish the season on a high by succeeding Liverpool as Champions League winners for the first time in the club’s history.
 “It is important,” said Guardiola on the confidence boost for his side. “Especially because they were incredibly focused.”
 City had given Liverpool a guard of honour before kick-off in their first game since becoming champions.
 “I saw them in the guard of honour and they were so focused, they didn’t even say ‘thank you’. That is why they are champions of Europe and the Premier League. They drank a lot of beers in the past week but they arrive here without beers in the blood to compete against us.”
 Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp, though, was adamant there had been no slacking in his side’s attitude a week on from ending a 30-year wait to win the league.
 “I wanted to see that we have really the right attitude. I saw that and the result we have to take,” said Klopp. “City is outstanding. They are incredible. I saw City’s season and I didn’t see a bad game, even when they lost.”
