COVID does not discriminate, so whether you’re a female or a male, we are all facing challenges, regardless of gender. For me, as a woman, I am not facing any different challenges than a man going through this. I think the biggest challenge, for any business leader, was there was no learned path to take, no best practices to use. We had to create them as we were working through them. I am fortunate in that our team modernized our business practice two years ago and have been working remotely since 2018. However, even our team who was well-versed in working remotely and who had embraced the culture faced several new elements to working from home. We suddenly had spouses at home, children in the next room trying to navigate school. It changed the norm. We have to be hyper-aware of everyone’s different situations and make allowances for that. Such as on Zoom calls, we need to be okay with a dog barking or a child talking, and we as leaders need to let our teams know it’s okay. We have learned a tremendous amount and will continue to learn, no doubt. But by far, the greatest challenge has been creating the new normal as we go, on the fly, and with little planning or preparation.

But we have two strategies. The first, when we roughly understand what will happen, is to create plan ‘A’ for the next 3–6 months. We also make plan ‘B’ for what will happen in a year and a half. Take a pandemic for example. If the pandemic lasts 3–6 months, then we build plan ‘A’ for this scenario and work on it. We also made plan ‘B’ for a year and a half. Every day we analyze what is happening so we can understand which scenario we are following: plan A or plan B. Only with a better understanding of the scenario, can you choose the path along which it is worth acting.

Because of the stressors of remote work, and new family dynamics layered in, it became more apparent than ever the need for vacation time and “me time.” It’s a difficult path to navigate as we’re told to shelter in place and it’s hard to get out and about, but we’ve encouraged our staff to take vacations, even if it’s a staycation. I think it’s extremely important for individuals to let their mind rest, put their worries aside, and have a little fun.

ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) — Uninsured New Yorkers can now apply for health insurance coverage through the end of the year in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Wednesday those people can apply for coverage through New York's health insurance marketplace or directly through insurers. The special enrollment period will run through Dec. 31. New York state health officials and insurers say they’re offering the special enrollment period so people don’t avoid seeking testing or medical care because of lack of health insurance coverage. Typically, people who lose workplace insurance have 60 days from when their coverage ended to apply for insurance on their state's marketplace. Most states that run their own health insurance marketplaces under the Affordable Care Act have provided an extended sign-up period for people who lost coverage in the pandemic. People who have lost income may be eligible for programs like Medicaid, which has year-round enrollment. About 6.3 million New Yorkers were enrolled in Medicaid as of May, according to the most recent state data available online, up from 6 million in January.

Big Ten is going to give fall football a shot after all. Less than five weeks after pushing football and other fall sports to spring in the name of player safety during the pandemic, the conference changed course Wednesday and said it plans to begin its season the Oct. 23-24 weekend. Each team will have an eight-game schedule. The Big Ten said its Council of Presidents and Chancellors voted unanimously Tuesday to restart sports. The vote last month was 11-3 to postpone, with Ohio State, Iowa and Nebraska voting against. The move came amid sharp pressure from coaches, a lawsuit from players and pressure from parents and even President Donald Trump pushing for a Big Ten football season. The conference is home to a number of battleground states in the November election, and Trump swifly applauded the move in a tweet. The emergence of daily rapid-response COVID-19 testing, not available when university presidents and chancellors decided to pull the plug on the season, helped trigger a re-vote. The Big Ten said it will begin daily testing of its athletes, coaches and staff on Sept. 30. The conference said it will require each school to designate a chief infection officer to oversee the collection and reporting of data for the conference. Team test positivity rate and population positivity rate thresholds will be used to determine whether teams must halt practice or play. The earliest an athlete can return to game competition would be 21 days following a COVID-19 positive diagnosis. “Everyone associated with the Big Ten should be very proud of the groundbreaking steps that are now being taken to better protect the health and safety of the student-athletes and surrounding communities,” said Dr. Jim Borchers, team physician for Ohio State.
