And to buy it, a Tesla Model 3 with the Autopilot function was added to the cart on Tesla’s website and the Reddit user’s dad clicked “Confirm” to, well, confirm his order.

This went on for about two hours.

Eventually, the website responded and ‘Confirmed’ the order – all 28 of them, taking the total billing amount to 1.4 million Euros! And given that each vehicle has a non-refundable charge of 100 Euro, that amount summed up to 2,800 Euros.

Thankfully, though, after a phone call Tesla understood the situation and cancelled the entire order. And yes, also returned the 2,800 Euro of deposit.
