He continued, "Where appropriate, other than certain things, like we have quite a few of the ventilators....We're trying to have supply sent directly to the states...We don't want medical supplies coming in to warehouses all over the place and then we take then from there and bring them to another warehouse. So we're having them brought ideally from the manufacturer ideally to the hospital or the state where it's going."

The status of the 2020 season remains up in the air.

We’re trying to do our part as an organization to try to help flatten the curve, so to speak.”

Reynolds said the Illinois Pharmacists Association has started reaching out to pharmacists and medical groups throughout the state to urge doctors, nurses and physician assistants not to write prescriptions for themselves and those close to them.
 “We even had a couple of examples of prescribers trying to say that the individual they were calling in for had rheumatoid arthritis,” he said, explaining that pharmacists suspected that wasn’t true. “I mean, that’s fraud.”
 In one case, Reynolds said, the prescriber initially tried to get the pills without an explanation and only offered up that the individual had rheumatoid arthritis after the pharmacist questioned the prescription.
 In a bulletin to pharmacists last Sunday, the state association wrote that it was “disturbed by the current actions of prescribers” and instructed members on how to file a complaint against physicians and nurses who were doing it.
 “People are losing their minds about this product,” said Brian Brito, president of SMP Pharmacy Solutions in Miami. “We’re selling so much of this stuff and people are just stockpiling it prophylactically if anybody in their family gets sick — they’re just holding on to it.”
 The two drugs are only available through a prescription and cannot be purchased over the counter. Hydroxychloroquine, sold under the brand name Plaquenil, is approved to treat lupus and rheumatoid arthritis while chloroquine is an anti-malarial treatment.
 There is little evidence that the drugs work to treat coronavirus, although clinical trials are underway to find out. But as coronavirus cases multiply and protective gear for medical workers vanishes from emergency rooms, many patients and physicians see the drugs as the only hope to reverse the course of serious disease.
 Brito said his pharmacy had about 800 tablets last Monday and were nearly sold out in about an hour. One doctor called and asked for 200 tablets, but the company refused. “He was a little upset about it but he understood and he went quickly from 200 to 42 tablets, which is essentially treating two people,” Brito said. “So yeah, they’re stockpiling it.”
 A pharmacist in Houston, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation and violating patient privacy, said he was recently asked by a surgeon for an unusually large quantity with unlimited refills. “He said it was because his wife had lupus,” the pharmacist said, “but when I asked him for her name and diagnosis, he told me just to put it in his.”
 Lupus patients are reporting difficulty in refilling their prescriptions for the drug. Last Monday, the Lupus Foundation of America issued a joint statement asking the White House Coronavirus Task Force to “take action to ensure current supplies are allocated for patients taking them for indicated uses.” Several states in the past few days have already moved to limit prescriptions of the drugs, neither of which is approved to treat the coronavirus. Trump, in press conferences and tweets over the past week, has promoted the use of the drugs as potentially blunting the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak.
 “It’s unfortunate that a news conference, I think prematurely, made it sound like this was the answer, and that’s led to this panic,” Michelle Petri, director of Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine’s Lupus Center, said Friday. “I have spent the last two days trying to help lupus patients who actually need their refills.” She said some patients have refills on back order while others are being provided smaller amounts than usual.
 The West Virginia Board of Pharmacy, in an alert last Saturday, ordered pharmacists to limit new prescriptions to no more than 30 tablets and only to cases where the drugs were being used for approved indications.
 “Currently, both nationally and in West Virginia, some prescribers have begun writing prescriptions for these drugs for family, friends, and coworkers in anticipation of Covid-19 related illness,” the board wrote.

"We lost a phenomenal senior class last year but we believe in the next one up mentality," he said. "We are confident and expectant of someone else to step into any role left open from last season.
 "We expect to always do our best to be competitive in the region and state as a team and individual performances," Patrick added. "We set lofty goals for our kids and have the highest expectations for them always because we know they are capable of great things. Last year, our girls won the team region title by a narrow margin against the eventual Class 'A' state Runner-up team in Somerset."
 Patrick said for his team to be successful, he will look to seniors Lillie Hall and Madison Chapman.
 "Lillie will look to defend her region title in pole vault and continue to be very competitive in the triple jump," he said. "Madison Chapman is our top returning thrower and looks to be very strong there once again. Junior Mikkah Siler is an accomplished high jumper and sprinter. You can expect to see Mikkah excel in various events for us this season.
 "We will look to talented junior Nevaeh Warren to lead our distance events," Patrick added. "Juniors Ashley Chapman and Hailey Brown should contribute in the field events as well. Eighth-grade standouts Lylah Mattingly and Madison Peace will contribute tremendously in the 2020 season. Lylah is one of the top returning hurdlers in Class A. Coming off of a podium finish last year, we will look to Lylah to help lead us in points. We expect Madison to have a breakout season this year in the sprints."
 Patrick said he is grateful to be able to coach, "such a wonderful group of young ladies," and is looking forward to a great season.
 "We have a classy group of girls that work extremely hard to improve each day," he said. "I'm thankful for the wealth of track and field coaching experience our girls get from Coach Abbott, Coach Harris, Coach Hall, Coach Berta, Coach Perkins, Coach Fleenor, and Coach Jarboe. Our team would not have success without each of them sacrificing their time to better our girls."

Two existential realisations are crucial in light of the above: 1. Many things, including life itself, are inflicted on us. We do not choose to be in the world, we do not choose who we are; our genes, DNA, the list of gifts and faults that make us into what we are, are in most cases imposed on us by the act of birth. We are often locked into situations that are basically forced on us. This includes being thrown into the world as well as being taken away. We may as well be upset by the fact that the sun rises in the east or by the shortening days of the winter. Being in the world is a form of acceptance or even surrender.
