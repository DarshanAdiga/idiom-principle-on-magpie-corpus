The First Minister has warned that anything else will result in the game being suspended as he told Sky Sports: "It’s a disgrace, a lack of respect for your teammates first and foremost. To leave the country, there’s no words. It’s terrible.
 "When you listen to the First Minister today, the way she spoke, she more or less threw it back to the SPFL and SFA to show they are fit and proper to deal with the situation.
 "What I will say is if they don’t, she’s going to step in and she will. Celtic are missing their next two games and with a Champions League game on the horizon next week, I wouldn’t be surprised if the First Minister has something to say in that as well because UEFA won’t be as lenient as maybe the SFA and SPFL have been over the years in Scotland.
 "For me, UEFA won’t give Celtic a second opportunity.
 "I touched on it at the weekend that the two Aberdeen games shouldn’t have gone ahead and that’s now happened. It’s up to the SFA and SPFL to deal with it, they’ve been questioned a lot in recent months with their handling of things so it’s up to them to go and deal with it.
 "That’s why they are paid what they are paid, that’s why they’re in the position they’re in so they have to deal with it, they have to fix it.

Other included-in-the-fare options found on most ships include what may be the two best quick-serve poolside dining venues at sea: The BlueIguana Cantina and Guy’s Burger Joint. BlueIguana is a Carnival knock-off of Chipotle with yummy made-to-order burritos and tacos. Created in partnership with The Food Network's Guy Fieri, Guy’s Burger Joint offers burgers that beat anything you’ll find around the pool on other mass-market ships and even most luxury vessels.

Para la postura conservadora, no se debe instruir a los niños respecto a la educacion sexual; si por esa falta de educacion sexual, alguna niña resulta embarazada, tampoco se le permitira abortar. Esto implicara que muchas dejen inconclusos sus estudios, y se conviertan en madres incluso antes de alcanzar la mayoria de edad. Desde luego que la decision de interrumpir o no un embarazo es personalisima, mas debe dotarsele a la poblacion de las herramientas y el conocimiento para que su decision sea consciente, y este desprovista de las presiones que la Iglesia y el sector conservador de la sociedad ejercen sobre la niña. No se trata de descubrir el hilo negro: los paises mas desarrollados del mundo tienen posiciones liberales y progresistas respecto a temas de esta naturaleza.

In short, there’s a ton to do up top on Carnival vessels -- and it's all available to every passenger on board the vessels at no extra charge. Unlike some lines, Carnival has resisted the trend of big-ship operators carving out whole sections of deck-top areas for the exclusive use of passengers staying in suites or willing to pay hefty access fees.

One other new-for-Carnival venue on Carnival Panorama is the first Sky Zone trampoline park at sea.

There’s even trampoline dodgeball and, on one end of the room, a climbing wall augmented with interactive game elements.

New Manchester City Women’s signing Sam Mewis admits playing in the Champions League is on every player’s bucket list.
 The 27-year-old, a World Cup winner with the United States last summer, has arrived on the back of successive Championship and Shield doubles in the National Women’s Soccer League with North Carolina Courage.
 Nevertheless, the draw of competing against Europe’s best lured her across the Atlantic.
 “We have had a lot of success at the Courage but I feel like on every soccer player’s bucket list is to play in the Champions League,” saw Mewis.
 “It is exciting, the possibility of winning something I have never won before. I am honoured I have this opportunity to compete over here.
 “What really drew me here was a desire to continue to develop and push myself and competing for something new is an exciting part of that.”
 Uprooting yourself 3,800 miles from a comfortable and successful professional life in North Carolina during the uncertainty of a global pandemic takes a certain leap of faith.
 But Mewis insists the chance to play for City was one she could not pass up, especially as she has her targets set on a place in next year’s Olympic team.
 “I think it is tough. Every individual in their career wants to accomplish certain things and develop in certain ways: for me I love the Courage and I hope to return there some day so it’s not like I was searching to leave,” she added.
 “But I do think there was a part of me when I heard this opportunity that was really excited to do something different and get out of my comfort zone.
 “I know with Covid happening it has thrown a lot of twists and turns around for everyone and obviously football is coming secondary to everyone’s health and safety but I thought this season in the WSL was a good opportunity for me to develop and push myself and grow.
 “It felt like the right decision and such a good opportunity I didn’t want to pass up.
 “Personally I have been thinking about my family – my husband is going to try to come and stay here for a little bit – but I think my family has been overall really supportive.
 “And the club is taking really good care of me so far so I am confident it will work out really well and I feel safe as we are following the protocols to keep everyone safe so it feels very positive.”

Carnival allows you to bring one bottle of wine or Champagne per person onto ships at boarding plus up to a dozen standard cans or cartons of nonalcoholic drinks such as sodas. Nonalcoholic drinks in glass or plastic bottles are not allowed. Note that you’ll be charged a $15 corkage fee if you want to bring the wine or Champagne to an onboard restaurant or bar to drink.

Carnival ships don't have quite as many features on board as Royal Caribbean or Norwegian vessels, in part because they're not as big. But they’re still packed with a lot of attractions, including multiple entertainment venues; lots of deck-top fun zones such as waterparks and ropes courses; casinos; and spas.

But when it comes to raucous, nothing on Carnival ships quite compares to the frequent karaoke nights on board. On Carnival, it's a thing.

California passed Assembly Bill 5 late last year in a bid to reclassify many gig economy workers as employees, and so far, Lyft and Uber have not done that. The state is suing them, and on Monday afternoon Judge Ethan Schulman of San Francisco Superior Court ruled in favor of granting a preliminary injunction that would block the companies from classifying drivers as independent contractors.
  _Reuters_ reports that in the 34-page decision Schulman said there's an "overwhelming likelihood" that the state will prove the two companies have illegally misclassified workers, and that they fail the law's three-step test to determine if workers are employees. He delayed enforcement of the ruling for ten days to allow for appeals, which both companies plan to pursue, while the  _San Francisco Chronicle_ reports Uber also said it will push for a longer stay. In a statement, Lyft said "We'll immediately appeal this ruling and continue to fight for their independence. Ultimately, we believe this issue will be decided by California voters and that they will side with drivers."
 Earlier in the day Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi published an op-ed calling for a gig worker's benefits fund, but insists drivers want to work independently. Uber and Lyft are also suing over the law, and are part of a coalition pushing to get Proposition 22 on the ballot in California this November, which would keep drivers as freelancers.

The quality of the food (and drink) on Carnival ships always surprises us, given the budget pricing of the brand. Despite being one of the industry’s lowest-cost operators, Carnival manages to pull off one of the best steakhouses at sea in Fahrenheit 555, and even the no-extra-charge main restaurants get the basics right. In general, the food isn't gourmet. But _for the price point_ of the line, it's really quite impressive.

Once on board a Carnival ship, you’ll pay extra for most drinks, extra-charge restaurants, spa services, shore excursions, internet service and a few other things — unless you’ve bought a package for some of these items in advance. Most onboard activities such as shows and deck-top attractions are included in the fare.
