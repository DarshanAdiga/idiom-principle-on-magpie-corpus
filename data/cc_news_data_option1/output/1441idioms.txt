Thierry Henry engaged the minds of his Monaco team with "bright, engaging" training sessions and could have been "fantastic" for the club had he not been sacked so quickly during the 2018-19 season, according to Rony Lopes.
 After a difficult start to the campaign that saw them win just one of their first nine matches, Leonardo Jardim was dismissed in October and replaced swiftly by Henry, who had previously been Roberto Martinez's assistant with Belgium.
 With an injury crisis ravaging the squad, results were little better under Henry, who won two of his 12 matches in charge, finding himself dismissed in January after a crushing 5-1 home defeat by Strasbourg and subsequently moving on to Montreal Impact in MLS.
 Curiously, Jardim was reinstated after Henry's sacking, but he only lasted until December and Lopes – who was a part of the Monaco squad last season – feels the Frenchman was shown the door too soon, convinced he was having an impact on a squad that had felt the full force of bad luck with injuries.
 HENRY 'LEARNED A LOT' AT MONACO
 HENRY MAKES IMPACT IN MLS SEASON OPENER
 "The time with Henry was a very hard campaign because it was a moment in the season when we had 17 injured players," Lopes said to The Athletic. "We played in the Champions League with five strikers who were 18 years old.
 "Even if they are good players, they do not have the experience to play games like that. It was a hard season for them. I have never been in a situation like that in my life.
 "I think people don't really know what happened with Thierry. In my opinion, the club did not give him enough time. The training sessions were really good and the ideas were bright, engaging and good.
 "When he had the players back fit, and the team starting to be how he wanted, the club sacked him. I did not agree with that. If they had given him more time, he could have been a fantastic coach for Monaco.

Still, chickens with white feathers do have personality traits that make them more attractive to large operators, according to Benson.
 "White chickens eat less feed, are lighter, more active and lay more eggs, which is why large production farms use them," he said.
 Roosters don't rule the roost at Heart of Texas Farms.
 "I have only two. They're here by accident," Benson said.
 The COVID-19 pandemic has kept Benson hopping, reportedly keeping his regular clients stocked with farm-fresh eggs as customers veer away from larger retail grocery stores that have experienced virus-related shortages.
 He sells graded eggs from free-roaming chickens for $4 a dozen, according to the company website.
 The immediate Benson family, which includes Andrew's parents, Mark and Shannon, and his sister, Annalise, live on about 150 acres. The Bensons raise a few cattle, and visitors might see a donkey or two wandering by. But the farm in Heart of Texas Farms belongs to Andrew. He is the sole proprietor, though family members occasionally lend a hand, Benson said in an interview.
 When his mom and sister visit relatives in Missouri, for example, they stock up on chicks at a hatchery there for hauling back to Waco. At last count, Heart of Texas Farms was home to about 1,500 laying hens, Benson said.
 That does not count the 580 chicks he was babysitting Saturday night.
 Benson said he collects about 70 dozen eggs daily for delivery. Family and friends eat those cracked or otherwise lacking in quality.
 A foul in top form will lay five or six eggs a week, he said.
 Elsewhere near Greater Waco, milk-maker Mill-King was hit hard by virus- related restrictions placed on restaurants and schools. But it has changed course and now enjoying skyrocketing sales, according to its owner.

Monday surely will bring more deliveries — to Jubilee Food Market, Lula Jane's on Elm Avenue, Drug Emporium, Milo All Day, Brazos Bistro in Waco's Hotel Indigo, Waco Farmers Market and Secret Chef — or he may do some welding on the privacy fences he crafts part-time, hoping to broaden that horizon in the near future. Or he may tinker with equipment needed to keep him high in the pecking order of locally owned and natural food sourcing.
 Other than that, the 19-year-old who loves his chickens and his blackberry patches and his own Heart of Texas Farms on Rosenthal Parkway in Lorena does not have a thing to do. Farming "keeps you humble," said Benson, who is that in spades. Asked how much revenue he generates with his egg-centric enterprise, Benson evenly replies, "Enough to pay the feed bill."
 His long-term vocational goals? "Whatever I want to do," he said.
 Just a guess, but that would seem attainable for Benson.
 Home-schooled, Benson said he did not have a favorite subject, "which is probably why I got into raising chickens."
 That journey started five years ago, when he began to build his brood a few birds at a time. He researched the minutiae and science of keeping birds happy, healthy and productive, free of disease and skilled at cornering bugs in the barnyard. A natural diet, clean living and roomy quarters, he discovered, meant tastier eggs.
 "Trial and error and reading online," Benson said of his methods.
 At least one study has found free-range chickens produce eggs lower in cholesterol and saturated fat, higher in vitamins A and E and Omega-3 fatty acids, though Benson did not make that claim in an interview.
 The eggs he sells typically have a brown-shaded shell.
 "You can tell the color egg a hen will lay by the color of its earlobe," Benson said. "It doesn't matter the color of the feathers."

"I don't know whether they took our license plates or not; it don't really matter," the Rev. Jack Roberts said during Sunday's service, which was livestreamed on the church's Facebook page. "Church, I'll just tell you something: If you get a ticket, if you get a ticket for being in church this morning, bring it to me; my lawyer said he'll take care of it. It's garbage; it's just garbage. I took a picture of my license plate on the back of my car and sent it to the governor yesterday. I just said, 'Save yourself a trip, right here it is. Ain't no need in coming out.'"
 During his opening remarks Sunday, Roberts acknowledged people who drove from Dayton, Ohio, and two women who drove from South Brunswick, New Jersey, to Kentucky to attend Maryville's Easter service. Roberts also said that someone scattered "at least one keg, one box" of nails throughout the church's parking lot before the congregation arrived for service.
 "I thought, 'You know, you could really be angry and, really, if you saw them doing it, you'd just kind of want to punch them out,' but the fact of it is we need to feel sorry for folks. I mean, of all the places to keep you from, they should have put them down at the liquor store ... . They could have put them down at the abortion clinic.
 "When our politicians get on TV and say that they wanna save one life, you could save 60 a day or better (in) downtown Louisville," he added, referencing EMW Women's Surgical Center on West Market Street. "I mean, it's not that complicated, folks. It's not lives they want to save."
 Beshear has frequently urged churches to cancel in-person services and has advocated against non-faith-based mass gatherings to help limit the spread of COVID-19, which has killed 94 people in Kentucky as of 5 p.m. Saturday.
 "People have focused on the license plates, but all I'm trying to do is say if you make the decision to go to a mass gathering, your decision should stay with you," Beshear said Saturday. "If you put yourself at risk, fine. Just self-quarantine for 14 days. I know some people might disagree with it. And it sounds however it sounds. But they don't have to read out the number of deaths every day. They don't have to do that. And while this is a worldwide pandemic, I feel responsible for those deaths, for better or worse."

Statewide directives asking for large public gatherings to cancel activities due to Covid-19 has had an enormous economic effect on many small businesses, including a rural Stafford County venue, The Welch Farm. Located west of Macksville, Kansas,
   
 Welch Farm is a wedding and event venue which is available to lease for weddings and family events. The farm also hosts concerts, air bnb guests, guided hunts and has both catering and liquor licenses.
   
 In 2019, Welch Farm hosted families from 35 states and 7 foreign countries including Mexico, China, France, Canada, South Africa, Australia, and The United Kingdom.
   
 The visionaries behind the rustic and re-purposed venue, Kevin and Michell Welch and their daughter, Megan Schnoebelen, have become well known in recent years for their hospitality, catering events both on and off the farm, their homemade BBQ sauce, which is
   
 Kevin's mother secret recipe and the overall fun and relaxing atmosphere that they have created from a once abandoned farmstead.
   
 "However, due to Covid-19, The Welch Farm has complied with state-wide social distancing requests and postponed all events both on and off the farm through the end of April," Michell Welch said. "The count is currently at 9 events that have been postponed."
   
 The Welch Farm was scheduled to kick off their seasonal venue events on March 28, 2020, by hosting the wedding of Larned couple, Kayla Reisner and Mathew Thompson.
   
 Mat and Kayla share a unique coincidence in that they both were born on March 28. The couple wanted to make March 28th their wedding day as well. Although, their large wedding and reception did not take place on March 28 due to Covid-19, the couple did come to the farm on their wedding day with their two children, the bride's parents, the matron of honor (brides sister), the groom's best man (brides brother in law) and the grooms sister. These family members were the only attendees for the couple's special day. Kevin Welch officiated the very short service and no other guests were present. The Thompson's reception has been rescheduled for Saturday, September 12, 2020, when hopefully, all their friends and family can safely attend their celebration.
   
 May 2020 events remain uncertain at this time and planned May 2nd bride, Jenna Bland of Pratt, has rescheduled for later in the summer."
   
 The Welch Farm also has had a June 5 "Welcome to Summer" concert scheduled for some time. In fact, they had just worked out the details when the shutdown happened. The Josh Abbott Band is the featured guest and hopefully things will have returned to normal by that time. However, The Welch Farm will follow all state guidelines concerning social distancing recommendations and are hoping if Covid19 is not under control by that date, that the band will work with them for an alternate date when it is safe for people to once again socialize in large crowds.
   
 Logan Mize was the first concert at The Welch Farm, and it was such a huge hit for this rural venue, that many requests have been made to the Welch's to continue this type of event.
   
 For the Welch family, 2019 was a busy year at the Farm. The first wedding of the season was April 20, Easter weekend, with the marriage of Taylor Tittle and Gabriel Bronkhorst. The Welch Farm was then reserved every weekend from Easter to October 26, 2019 with the exception of only a few open dates.
   
 The Welch Farm is currently a non-climate controlled, seasonal venue with a large pavilion, plenty of shade and lots of rustic charm.
   
 "We just started the dirt work to begin renovations of the back barn which will have a conference space to host corporate meetings, group hunter get togethers, a porch for VIP ticket holders to concert events and a spa similar to Rock Haven south of Hays," Michelle Welch said.
   
 The Welch Farm does have a few openings available for summer and a few in September and October of 2020, they do however, already have events scheduled for 2021.
   
 For weddings and events that were forced to cancel due to social distancing and numbers of people allowed to gather at one time, Welch offered brides and event coordinators any available open date to reschedule their special event. There is no rescheduling fee. No additional charges. No extra anything.
   
 "If your special day was canceled due to Covid-19, you have first choice at any future available date and we will also help anyone who has booked with other venues who are not as fortunate with options available for alternate dates," Welch said. "Public event cancellations are out of our hands and out of the hands of our guests. We do, however, have clients sign a contract when reserving a date at The Welch Farm, and we do require that they purchase event insurance. No one has ever had to use their insurance. We require this for several reasons including liability, but you never know about severe weather such as tornadoes and such and weddings are expensive."
   
 Welch said they definitely wanted to do everything possible as people and as a business to make this time of coronavirus pandemic less stressful on all parties.
   
 While 2020 may not be going as expected for The Welch Farm, they aren't ready to stop moving forward anytime soon.
   
 "We are available to resume outside catering starting May 1,"Welch said.
   
 Although The Welch Farm has both food and beverage licenses, they are not available to the public to stop in anytime. It is a private venue available to lease for special occasions. However, The Welch Farm is observing the recommendations set forth by the governor of Kansas and no events will be hosted through the April 30 guidelines. Dates beyond April 30 could be affected as well.

ThisDay | Iraq News Now)- By: Kayhan Int’l Staff WriterThe situation in Iraq, where the meddling Americans are unwilling to withdraw their occupation forces despite the demand of the Iraqi parliament and have also not stopped interfering in the country’s bid to set up a stable government, appears grim for the Land of the Two Rivers.Last Thursday President Barham Salih asked Iraq’s Intelligence Chief Mustafa al-Kadhemi to take up the post of prime minister and in the next thirty days form a cabinet capable of mustering the vote of confidence from the parliament.      Kadhemi is the third premier-designate in the past six months following the resignation last October of Prime Minister Adel Abdul-Mahdi, and it is still not clear whether like his two predecessors – Mohammad Allawi and the American candidate Adnan az-Zurfi – who had to bow out because of lack of support from the major parliamentary factions, he will be able to succeed.A major drawback for the 53-year old Kadhemi are his ties with the US, which wasted no time in expressing its support for the Intelligence Chief, who it seems is now trying to curry favour with the Shi’a Muslim parties that form the majority in the parliament.This blatant meddling by the hated Americans in the affairs of Iraq is likely to abort Kadhemi’s candidacy and cause further delay in formation of a new, stable, and broad-based government under a nationally trusted prime minister, despite the support expressed by fringe groups for him.The current crisis ought to be an eye-opener for Iraq’s majority community, which unfortunately has not been able to form a formidable united front of which it is quite capable but hasn’t been able to do so because of unnecessary bickering over trivial issues.It should also be a wakeup call for the politically naïve elements in the religious circles to develop a better understanding of the complicated situation of their US- occupied and terrorist-infested homeland, by refraining from unwarranted remarks that forced the unanimously endorsed Abdul-Mahdi to tender in his resignation within a year of taking up the prime minister’s post and doing a commendable job in the face of the sedition that Washington and Riyadh had fanned at Baghdad’s Tahrir Square and in the southern parts of the country through resurrection of the Ba’thist residue in a bid to splinter the texture of the Shi’a Muslim community.The onus is on Grand Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Sistani, whose dynamic call to the nation in 2014 had led to the formation of the Hashd ash-Sha’bi, the grassroots Popular Mobilizations Units (PMU), which with timely fraternal and friendly advisory and military assistance from the Islamic Republic of Iran, succeeded in weeding out the takfiri terrorists to the horror of the US and Saudi Arabia.The PMU remains the most loyal and trusted guardians of Iraq’s independence, national sovereignty, and territorial integrity, and the only hope for ridding the country from the meddling Americans, despite losing their highly capable general, Abu Mahdi al- Muhandis in the cowardly terrorist strike by the US, whose chief target was the iconic anti-terrorist Iranian general, Qassem Soleimani.The blood of these martyrs is fresh and is undoubtedly the stimulus for all truly nationalist and religious sectors of the Iraqi society, which wants a prime minister and a government to represent the nation, rather than serving the interests of the Americans, the Saudis, or the Israelis.Hopefully, this time as well, similar to the edict of 2014, the Marja’iyyah in holy Najaf from the shadows of the sacred shrine of the One and Only Commander of the Faithful, Imam Ali (AS), whose model rule of social justice continues to be the elusive goal of all justice-seeking administrations in history, will issue an open and unambiguous edict for the deliverance of Iraq from the Americans and their local stooges, since the faithful are eagerly awaiting God Almighty’s Promise of the reappearance of Imam Mahdi (AS) and establishment of the city of Kufa as the headquarters of his global government of peace, prosperity, and justice.

 "We are working around the clock each day with the NCA (National Crime Agency) and French law enforcement agencies to arrest and dismantle organised crime gangs in France," Mr Eastaugh said.
 Extra police patrols were being deployed on French beaches "on a daily basis", he said, as well as specialist vehicles, drones and detection equipment.
 The Home Office said Border Force and all operational staff had personal protective equipment (PPE) available to them.

 At one point, the Australian broker told the middleman in Pittsburgh that 2 million masks were located in a warehouse in Georgia and that the product had been inspected by a particular certification company.
 That, Brady said, “was also part of the ruse.”
 No money was exchanged in the attempts to finalize a deal, according to Brady.
