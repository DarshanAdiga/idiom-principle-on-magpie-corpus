Buck Condit added that the county testing system for coronavirus, as well as contact tracing, needs to be overhauled. "We need to take a good look at that," he said.
 Channce Condit gave credit to his father, Chad Condit, for managing his campaign.
 Zoslocki said close to 10 p.m. he would wait for the next results before making a definitive comment. But he didn't sound optimistic.
 "I am disappointed in the sense that I did want to win," Zoslocki said. "As far as the process, the election was fair and the voters chose."
 Zoslocki said having two cousins on the board will be an "interesting experiment," but it's the outcome chosen by voters.
 Vito Chiesa, the only incumbent on the ballot, was not opposed and will serve a fourth term.
 Buck Condit's employer, Stanislaus Consolidated, has been at the center of contention over fire service in the eastern part of the county.
 Condit has promised to work on improving public safety services including filling gaps in sheriff patrols. During the campaign, Zoslocki emphasized his local government experience and business background in the construction trade. He promised to keep pushing for infrastructure expansion and transportation projects like the Highway 132 reroute.
 The District 5 election featured two candidates who sit at the dais at Ceres council meetings. Hallinan is city attorney for Ceres and also a legal adviser for Patterson and Newman.
 There was a slight difference between Condit and Hallinan in their support for a new storage reservoir proposed in a canyon just west of Patterson. Hallinan said he supported the dam being developed by Del Puerto Water District and other entities in the face of opposition from environmentalists and vocal Patterson residents.
 Condit said he supports new water storage for agriculture but would keep an open mind to different sites for the reservoir.
 Channce and Buck Condit both received generous campaign donations and support from firefighter labor groups.
 Zoslocki accepted thousands of dollars in contributions from the California Real Estate PAC and Mapes Ranch Investments.
 If the results hold up, Channce Condit, a Democrat, will break a long streak of Republicans serving on the five-member nonpartisan board. Gov. Gavin Newsom also is expected to appoint a Democrat to complete the unexpired board term of former state senator Tom Berryhill, who died in August.

As if 2020 could get any drearier, many Bay State residents saw snowflakes flying Friday before the calendar even turned to November and Gov. Charlie Baker made his best attempt this week to call off Thanksgiving.
 But for many legal enthusiasts and practitioners, there was a Budd of light.
 Baker nominated Kimberly Budd to become the 38th and next chief justice of the Supreme Judicial Court. If confirmed, Budd, an associate justice on the SJC, would be the first Black woman to lead the 328-year-old court, and the second woman and second Black justice to hold the title.
 Former Gov. Deval Patrick and one-time Baker political foe Deval Patrick called it an "inspired choice." It was Patrick, after all, who first made Budd a judge in 2009, and he was not alone in praising the pick.
 Budd first joined the SJC in 2016 when Baker included her in his first round of three picks for the top court, but she called this occasion a "bittersweet" one, knowing that her moment in the sun only came around because of the unexpected death of the late Chief Justice Ralph Gants last month.
 With the weight of history and a pandemic thrust onto her shoulders, the Harvard Law School graduate and daughter of former U.S. Attorney Wayne Budd said it was both "overwhelming" and "very meaningful" to be in such a position.
 "We're in the middle of a pandemic," Budd said during her introductory press conference. "People in the commonwealth are in a panic. People are hurting, and we have to make sure that the judiciary is running as well as it can, and that's what I'm focused on now."
 The Governor's Council, which had its own brush with COVID this week that forced it to meet remotely, plans a Nov. 12 confirmation hearing. Baker said he hopes to put two more nominees before the council soon to round out the seven-member court, at which point all seven justices will have been nominated by Baker.
 Budd, at 54, would also be the youngest chief justice in more than a century, but her age would put her outside of the problematic "under 30 crowd" that Baker identified this week as the source of the greatest COVID-19 spread, a change from the early days of the pandemic when those over 60 drove most cases.
 With the days of 1,000 or more new daily cases mounting - 1,488 more on Friday - Baker last week issued a warning about Thanksgiving: "The science on this one's pretty clear - gathering in groups indoors for an extended period of time with family and friends is likely the worst possible scenario for spreading the virus."
 The state is urging people to rethink Thanksgiving gatherings, asking families to limit dinners and football watching to people within a household, and if outside friends and family are invited, to wear masks and avoid buffet-style dining.
 And no picking at the turkey carcass, Health and Human Services Secretary Marylou Sudders cautioned.
 Baker announced new protocols Monday.
 With Thanksgiving just a few weeks away and the Legislature nowhere near close to sending Gov. Baker a fiscal year 2021 budget, the House and Senate made quick work this week of another interim budget to keep the government open beyond this weekend.
 The $5.4 billion spending authorization bill is the third interim budget to be approved for the fiscal year that began July 1, and Baker said it should be enough money to get through November.
 The Legislature still hasn't met in a formal session since the end of July, but it also managed to pass a bill signed by Baker to make an estimated 17,000 workers newly eligible for up to $1,800 in enhanced federal unemployment benefits that they did not initially qualify for because their standard benefits were too little.
 By increasing the minimum weekly benefit to $100 for the week ending July 31 through the week ending Sept. 5, the Legislature allowed thousands of workers who were unemployed during that six-week period to access up to $31 million in total federal support.
 The activity in the Legislature was some of the most substantive since its last formal session in July, and the pace will likely pick up after the conclusion of the election next Tuesday when lawmakers will enter lame duck waters uncharted since the 1990s.
 The pressure is mounting from supporters of an abortion access bill known as the ROE Act to move quickly in light of Amy Coney Barrett's confirmation to the Supreme Court, and advocates of all stripes and colors are likely to come out of the woodwork post-election to see if they can resuscitate whatever issue stalled during the normal lawmaking season.
 Education Secretary Jim Peyser cautioned legislators against hiding behind the "stalking horse" of calls for the state to scrap next year's MCAS exam, suggesting such efforts are just a precursor to trying to eliminate standardized testing completely.
 Peyser, testifying at an Education Committee oversight hearing, said the test to be administered this coming spring after a 2020 hiatus will be important to understanding how much learning students lost during the pandemic.
 And to prevent them from losing any more ground, Peyser, Baker and Education Commissioner Jeff Riley said it's important that students return to the classroom, even as COVID-19 cases rise and fears of a fall surge become realized.
 The administration continues to assert that schools have not proven to be transmission grounds for the virus, and can be safely operated. Peyser and Baker both said that even if a community moves into the "red" category, schools that are open should stay that way unless there was a specific outbreak in the school system.
 As for that red zone, communities are finding it easier to get there than the New England Patriots these days.
 Fifty-four new cities and towns found themselves in the state's highest risk category this week, meaning more than a third of the state is now shaded red. That's part of why Massachusetts found itself on Connecticut's travel quarantine list week, and New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo cautioned New Yorkers to stay out of Massachusetts if they can avoid it.
 The rise in COVID-19 infection might have prompted a debate over voter turnout in next Tuesday's election had vote-by-mail not become so popular. But as it stood Thursday, nearly 44 percent of all registered voters had already cast their ballots, and turnout was equal to 62.4 percent of the total ballots cast in the 2016 elections.
 Of the more than 2 million votes cast, nearly 1.3 million had voted by mail, including Gov. Baker. Baker told the News Service Friday he had already voted by mail, but did not say if or who he had voted for in the presidential contest.
 Earlier in the week, Baker and Lt. Gov. Karyn Polito, jointly, came out against ranked-choice voting as a too complicated reform that would discourage participation and be too costly at a time when public officials should be focused on making it easier for people to participate.
 His position put him at odds with leaders of both parties, including former Gov. Bill Weld, a Republican and prominent Yes on 2 supporter, but it also had echoes of one used by Democrats like Jerry Brown in California to veto similar voting reforms.

Rachel Robichaud, 28, juggled busy shifts last spring at Whole Foods Market in Framingham with her class schedule.
 When she wasn't trying to enforce rapidly changing guidelines and control anxious crowds, Robichaud was settling into remote courses toward her liberal arts degree at Massachusetts Bay Community College. Some interactions with customers could get nasty, said Robichaud, and distance learning meant a lot more responsibility on her as a student.
 Performing the balancing act again in the fall felt too overwhelming, said Robichaud. The 28-year-old with a 4.0 GPA is opting to take this semester off, and return when she feels ready.
 "Working in a grocery store, you encounter emotional stress, people on edge every single day," said Robichaud, who is a customer service supervisor. "To enforce mask-wearing and social distancing for 8 hours a day and then go home and try to focus -- it takes a toll."
    Salve Regina has the fewest COVID-19 cases among R.I. colleges. Why?  
 Robichaud is far from alone. MassBay's enrollment of 3,751 undergraduate students for the fall semester represents a 7% dip compared with its 2019 numbers. Contributing to that drop are about 225 students who chose to not return.
 Meanwhile, Framingham State University, which has 3,467 undergraduate students this fall, saw a 10% decline, according to data released by the state Department of Higher Education.
 Overall, 160,430 undergraduate students are enrolled within the Massachusetts public higher education system this fall, compared to last fall when 172,568 students were enrolled. It's the largest single-year decrease in fall undergraduate, according to the department, since its data collection began. This fall's overall enrollment level is comparable to the level of early 2000s.

 Representatives from Dean College in Franklin did not respond to messages asking for enrollment figures. Enrollment numbers from Regis College in Weston were not received by press time. Both are private institutions.
 Usually, community colleges see a bump in enrollment during economic slowdowns, as people choose to return to school to learn a new skill. But a pandemic-triggered recession brings a host of new challenges for students, said MassBay President David Podell.
 For example, many community college students are parents, said Podell. With most districts in a hybrid or remote model, he said he believes that many did not return or enroll because they would have had to balance childcare with studies.
 "Their family lives have been disrupted," said Podell.
 In other cases, students may have lost their jobs or need to pick up more hours, said Podell, saying "we're competing with their basic needs."
 To try to make things easier, the college has made more courses asynchronous so students can participate at any time, though he noted that does not work for all subjects.
    UMass to bring more students back for spring semester; more virus testing planned  
 For Framingham State, President Javier Cevallos said students are likely missing the on-campus aspect.
 "Our students want to be on campus, they don't want to be in front of a computer," said Cevallos. "They want to have the campus experience, athletic events, and clubs ... We have a number of students who just postponed for one year or deferred their admissions. They're waiting to see what happens."
 Though Framingham State's enrollment has declined compared to 2019, Cevallos estimated the university's enrollment of undergraduate students is likely back its 2010 numbers. Then, the institution experienced a large increase of students.
 College and university officials worry the trend has the potential to disrupt the education plans for some students. Podell said he's concerned about the students "who stop, who may not come back."
    'There are universities and colleges in New England who won't survive this': Pandemic impacts rippling across higher education  
 A 2013 study by Florida State University professor Toby J. Park tracked 38,000 community college students as they navigated school in Texas. He found that 94% of them had at least one "period of non-enrollment."
 More than 20,000 eventually returned to school, and 30% of those went on to receive their bachelor's degree.
 But those who dropped out two or more times struggle to graduate, Park found. Fewer than 5% of those students earned a four-year degree.
 "The biggest concern is that students lose their momentum in college," said Podell.
 Podell also noted that usually there's a lag between a recession and when enrollment picks up. For example, when the 2008 recession hit, enrollment at MassBay began to creep up until its peak in 2011.
 Cevallos said the university will continue to reach out to students to learn what barriers they're facing and then determine how best to help.
 "A bachelor's degree is really a ticket to a more productive life" and better wages, said Cevallos.
    Framingham State campus police reported not wearing masks  
 Robichaud, the MassBay student taking a temporary break, said she has four courses left before finishing her degree.
 Initially, she felt discouraged, saying it felt like she "was giving up."
 "I had to remind myself that I'm just doing the best I can with what I have and remember not to overwhelm myself either. I do feel like I made the right decision. As much as I'd hoped that things would have lightened up at work, they haven't. In that way I feel like I made the right decision."
 "School will still be there. You're not a failure for taking some time off," said Robichaud.

For 20 years I taught courses in education ethics and my classrooms were full of teachers and coaches and school administrators.

BROCKTON -- Typically, when the last name Colombo is mentioned in Brockton circles, it's about the legendary Boxers football coach and others from the Italian family who were known for their exploits on the gridiron.
 But for Jack Colombo, sports was never his forte, instead applying his creative skills in the field of music.
 Jack Colombo, 61, recalled going to a physical education class in high school led by his father's cousin, Armond Colombo, the late, renowned Brockton High School coach whose football teams won nine Eastern Mass. Division 1 Super Bowl championships.
 "I went to gym and Armond used to say, 'Go to the Fine Arts Building,'" Jack Colombo said. "My claim to fame is I'm the only Colombo who existed with no athletic ability."

 Colombo, a full-time musician and lifelong Brocktonian, was named a KORG USA- endorsed artist this year, as the keyboard company recognizes him for a career of accomplishments, including performances with 140 different acts with top 50 hit songs.
 Colombo, as a multi-keyboard performer, pianist, arranger and producer, has played with award-winning groups like The Drifters, featuring Charlie Thomas, serving as the group's music director for 23 years. He's also played concerts around the country and arranged music for The Lettermen, Al Jardine of The Beach Boys, The O'Jays, Bowzer of Sha Na Na, Ben E. King, Mary Wilson of The Supremes, The Manhattan Transfer and many others.
 Colombo is joining a long list of KORG artists that is highlighted by legends of the music industry like Phil Collins and Herbie Hancock.
 "I'm in good company," said Colombo, speaking recently by phone. "I'm humbly happy about it. It's a godsend. The opportunity doesn't come along people's way a lot. The keyboards are difficult endorsements. The products are a lot of money. It's different than drumsticks or guitar sponsorships. Those are more easy to come by."
 Colombo is founder, co-owner and an instructor at the Southeast School of Music in Easton.
 And Colombo has directed oldies music specials for PBS, made music for television commercials, served as music director for a Boston City Hall Plaza concert series, directed ballet pop concern series, provided a soundtrack for a Pittsburgh Steelers pre-game show, orchestrated a private Super Bowl celebration for the New England Patriots, directed music for the Catholic Tri- Parishes of Brockton and led national artist shows for Caribbean and Alaskan cruise companies. He also worked for the Vocal Group Hall of Fame as a musical director for three years. And he put together the The Drifters vocalists reunion in 2005 that aired on PBS.
 Colombo has shared his love of music with his daughter, Tori Colombo, a seventh grader at West Middle School, who has joined him on stage, including once with The Drifters playing percussion at just nine years old in 2017 at Stadium Theatre in Woonsocket, Rhode Island. Jack Colombo said he started playing organ and piano at age 9, first playing professionally as a 16-year- old at local function halls and family parties, calling the rock organ his "first love."
 "It was really cool as a dad to see her on stage," Colombo said. "And it was really cool for them, too. She was the youngest person to ever perform with The Drifters. It was awesome."
 Colombo said his daughter also brought her percussion rig on stage to join him and Bowzer from Sha Na NA in front of an audience of 16,000 people at the Mohegan Sun Arena in Connecticut during an oldies rock concert in 2018.
 "I think it is crazy to have a dad that has played in front of thousands of people," Tori Colombo said, during a break from remote learning classes, congratulating her father on the Korg artist endorsement. "I'm really happy. He always works hard no matter what. I'm glad this happened for him. It's amazing how he gets recognized everywhere and how he's so talented on the piano. It really is a blessing to have a dad that amazing."
 Colombo said another cool moment in his career was when he was complimented by singer and songwriter Paul Simon, who was in the audience for a 60s music show headlined by The Drifters at the Bergen Performing Arts Center in New Jersey around five years ago or so.
 "I was in disbelief," said Colombo, adding that he would have been a lot more nervous performing had he known Simon was in the crowd. "He said, 'You know, I'm not a fan of four-piece groups, but you guys really pulled it off and it sounded amazing.' I thought that was an awesome compliment."
 When Colombo became a musical director for the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 2002, it opened up a new world for him, as he began to work with great singers, musicians and nationally renowned bands who made so many top hit songs.
 "I played with like 18 groups the first time around who had top hits, including Mary Wilson, The Manhattan Transfer and Al Jardine," Colombo said. "That kind of opened up that whole world and got me really involved in that circuit. Then everything became wide open. The floodgates opened up."

Incumbent and notary public Gil Esquer, 70, is running for a second term. Criminal defense attorney Rebecka Monez, 45, and emergency management professional Ruben Wegner, 34, are vying for the seat as political newcomers.
 Meanwhile, business owner Pam Franco, 57, and accountant Robert Puffer, 63, are seeking to replace outgoing Council Members Becky Arellano. Franco interviewed for the District 4 vacancy in January 2019 after Amy Bublak was elected mayor, but the council appointed Arellano to a term ending this year. Puffer is also running for office for the first time.
 Election officials have counted 2,744 votes in the District 2 race and 4,789 votes in the District 4 race, according to the 10:30 p.m. preliminary results report.
 While Monez and Wegner did not hold events Tuesday night, Esquer rented a hall to thank his supporters but said he limited the number of attendees.

BOSTON -- Democrat Joe Biden won Massachusetts as voting concluded Tuesday.
 Massachusetts residents faced a lot of choices: They voted to fill an open U.S. House seat, weighed two hotly contested statewide ballot questions and decided whether to reelect some longtime incumbents to Congress. A record number of voters already cast ballots early or by mail, changing the complexion of Tuesday's election.
 Democratic U.S. Sen. Edward Markey fended off a challenge from Republican Kevin O'Connor. The 74-year-old Markey rebuffed a high-profile primary challenge from Democratic U.S. Rep. Joe Kennedy III in September.
 In the state's 4th Congressional District, Democratic Newton City Councilor Jake Auchincloss is hoping to become the newest member of the state's all- Democratic congressional delegation by defeating Republican Julie Hall. The open seat is currently held by Kennedy, who opted not to seek reelection after deciding to challenge Markey.
 Voters also weighed the fate of two questions on the ballot.
 The first would expand the state's "Right to Repair" law by giving car owners and independent auto shops greater access to data related to vehicle maintenance and repair.
 Car repair shops and auto parts suppliers said the measure would guarantee car owners access to the repair information needed to bring their cars to auto shops as vehicles become more computerized. Automakers cast the question as a data grab by third parties who want to gather personal vehicle information.
 The second question would make major changes to the way ballots are cast and tallied in future elections in Massachusetts by introducing ranked choice voting.
 Under that system, voters would be given the option of ranking candidates in order of their preference -- one for their top choice, two for their second choice, and so on.
 If no candidate receives a majority of the first-choice votes, the candidate with the fewest votes would be eliminated. Voters who ranked the eliminated candidate as their first choice would have their votes counted instead for their second choice. The process repeats until one candidate receives a majority of the vote and wins.
 Republican Gov. Charlie Baker is among the opponents of ranked choice voting, calling it complicated and costly. Polls suggested a close race between the "yes" and "no" camps.
 Four of the state's remaining eight Democratic House incumbents are facing Republican challengers.
 Rep. Jim McGovern, who represents the state's 2nd Congressional District, is hoping to fend off GOP challenger Tracy Lovvorn, while 5th Congressional District Rep. Katherine Clark is trying to defeat a challenge from Republican Caroline Colarusso. Former presidential candidate Rep. Seth Moulton, who represents the 6th Congressional District, is hoping to defeat GOP challenger John Paul Moran, while Rep. William Keating, who represents the 9th Congressional District, is hoping to beat back a challenge from Republican Helen Brady and independent Michael Manley.
 Two Democratic incumbents -- 1st Congressional District Rep. Richard Neal and 3rd Congressional District Rep. Lori Trahan -- ran unopposed. Two others -- 7th Congressional District Rep. Ayanna Pressley and 8th Congressional District Rep. Stephen Lynch -- faced little-known independent challengers.
