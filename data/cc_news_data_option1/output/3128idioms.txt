LAS VEGAS — Canadian featherweight Gavin Tucker looked impressive in stopping Justin (The Guitar Hero) Jaynes in the third round on a UFC Fight Night card Saturday.
 The 34-year-old from Ship Cove, N.L., who fights out of Halifax, used his striking skills to soften up Jaynes before submitting him at 1:43 of the final round via a rear-naked choke.
 The main event at the UFC's Apex production facility saw 35-year-old Derrick (The Black Beast) Lewis, ranked fourth among UFC heavyweight contenders, take on No. 10 Aleksei Oltinik, a 43-year-old Russian.
 Tucker (12-1-0) used kicks early to keep the hard-hitting Jaynes at distance. And he looked good as the round wore on, hitting Jaynes with combinations — until Jaynes felled Tucker out of the blue with a left uppercut with 90 seconds remaining.
 Tucker somehow survived and then fought off an attempted guillotine choke that looked tight — so tight the Canadian almost lost his shorts in the exchange. As the round neared an end, Tucker regained control and Jaynes had to outlast an arm-triangle choke as the hooter went off.
 Tucker outstruck Jaynes in the second round with the American's face showing damage. Jaynes lost his mouthpiece during one exchange and the round ended with Tucker battering Jaynes at the fence.
 Tucker staggered Jaynes with a knee early in the third round. The fight went to the ground soon after and Tucker, a black belt in Brazilian jiu-jitsu, took Jaynes' back and locked in a rear-naked choke.
 "Once we hit the mat, I felt really comfortable," said Tucker. "But he's tough though, he knew I was coming for him. And honestly, he hits with rocks. This guy's a big swinger."
 It was Tucker's first fight since July 2019 when he beat South Korean Seung Woo Choi at UFC 240 in Edmonton. That ended a 22-month absence in the wake of a lopsided loss to Rick (The Gladiator) Glenn at UFC 215.
 Jaynes (16-5-0) won his UFC debut June 20 on short notice, needing just 41 seconds to stop lightweight Frank (The Crank) Camacho. Jaynes came down a weight class to meet Tucker at 145 pounds.
 This report by The Canadian Press was first published Aug. 8, 2020.

Johnson was among eight players who had at least a share of the lead at some point Saturday, a wild third round of low scores, long putts and endless possibilities.
 One possibility is Brooks Koepka hoisting the Wanamaker Trophy for the third straight year, which hasn’t happened since Walter Hagen won four in a row in the 1920s when it was match play. Koepka was one shot behind when he made a few careless mistakes, ran off three straight bogeys and had to birdie the 18th for a 69 to stay within two shots.
 Confident as ever, Koepka stole a glance at the leading contenders and quickly measured what he has that they don't, specifically four majors. Not even seeing the 54-hole lead belonging to Johnson bothered him.
 “When I've been in this position before, I've capitalized,” Koepka said. “He's only won one. I'm playing good. I don't know, we'll see.”
 Of the top six players, Johnson and Koepka are the only major champions.
 Scottie Scheffler, the PGA Tour rookie from Texas, ran off three straight birdies only to miss a 6-foot par putt on the final hole. He still shot a 65 and was one shot behind, in the final group at his first PGA Championship. Cameron Champ, who has the most powerful swing on tour, shot 67 and joined Scheffler one shot behind.
 Johnson was at 9-under 201 as he goes for his second major title. For all the chances he has had, this is only the second time he has led going into the final round. The other was down the coast at Pebble Beach, his first chance at winning a major. He had a three-shot lead in the 2010 U.S. Open and shot 82.
 Now he is more seasoned with experiences good (21 tour victories) and bad (five close calls in the majors).
 “I'm going to have to play good golf if I want to win. It's simple,” Johnson said. “I've got to hit a lot of fairways and a lot of greens. If I can do that tomorrow, I'm going to have a good chance coming down the stretch. ... I'm just going to have to do what I did today. Just get it done."

Dugan has had some of the highest representative honours in his career.
 He has played for Country in the City vs Country match.
 He's represented NSW 12 times across six different State of Origin series.
 And he's had the ultimate honour of playing 12 matches for Australia and was part of their 2017 World Cup-winning side.
 However, it speaks to the character of Dugan that arguably his greatest legacy will be the work he has done in de-stigmatising the discussion surrounding mental health in rugby league.
 While opposing fans will label him 'soft', or 'injury-prone', it's Dugan's ability to always be honest and talk about his problems that should be what they really admire.
 In 2018, he spoke about the pressures he faced from the media and trying to constantly put a positive face to the world.
 In 2019, Dugan spoke about his prescription-drug abuse and the fact that his mental health got to a point where he would be reclusive and wouldn't even talk to his now-wife, Jordan.
 These types of admissions from players are rare, especially ones still in the game and playing at the highest level.
 He was in the headlines again at the start of this season when reports emerged he was trying to leave Cronulla and that medical retirement was an issue due to a chronic knee injury.
 "I never actively sought medically retiring," Dugan told reporters back in March a fortnight after the reports emerged.
 It's something he reiterated going into his match with the Eels this weekend, the fact that while he never wanted to retire the injuries naturally took a toll on his day-to-day life.
 "I mean I said it all along, I didn’t want to retire," Dugan said.
 "I still felt like I could give something and still perform.
 "In the past, when I was younger...I was taking things for granted that my talent would get me by.
 "Talent gets you so far, but it’s the other little things you’ve got to do as well.
 "Anyone that says it (injuries) doesn’t take a toll on them is probably lying.
 "It’s part of the game, injuries, and the pressure of it.
 "You learn to grow with it and handle it a bit better than you would when you first come in. You learn little strategies and ways to stay positive and things like that."
 Dugan also contributes a lot of time to the community, who can forget when he grew a mullet for nine months to raise funds for Bear Cottage.
 It's part of a balance Dugan has achieved on and off the field. Despite all the constant headlines and scrutiny he faced, he kept doing his thing.
 He just focused on one thing, being Josh Dugan.
 There's only one thing Dugan still wants to tick off his list, and he hopes he can do it with his Sharks teammates in 2020.
 "I wouldn’t change it, the journey I’ve had," Dugan said.
 "It’s been a rollercoaster but it’s made me who I am and I couldn’t be happier.
 "Playing for Australia, winning an Origin series and that sort of thing, obviously up there as well.
 "There’s one feather I’d like to put in my hat and that’s a comp, so hopefully we can get there this year."
 So here's to you Josh Dugan.

Company tax cuts could again be on the agenda when the federal government hands down its delayed budget on October 6.
 But Labor is showing little enthusiasm should this prove to be true, saying there are bigger priorities for the Morrison government, such as providing a plan for jobs.
 Finance Minister Mathias Cormann says he will continue to focus on making it easier for businesses "to survive, to be viable, to be profitable" in what will be his final budget input before he retires from politics at the end of the year.
 "That will include a focus on the appropriate tax policy settings," Senator Cormann told ABC TV's Insiders program.
 He said tax settings must give businesses the confidence to invest in future growth and to hire more Australians.
 But shadow assistant treasurer Stephen Jones is unimpressed by such an approach.
 "We think there are bigger priorities and better ways to stimulate the economy," Mr Jones told reporters in Canberra.
 "We don't think that we are going to see a tax cut-led recovery."
 Labor has more interest in the government producing a plan for jobs and how to get the country out of its first recession in nearly 30 years.
 Small and medium-sized businesses with a turnover of less than $50 million are already enjoying lower tax rates, which are legislated to settle at 25 per cent after gradual cuts from 30 per cent.
 However, big business is still stuck at the 30 per cent rate after the government failed to convince opposition parties and independents to back a reduction in the rate to 25 per cent for all firms.
 The 2020/21 budget was delayed from its traditional May release because of the outbreak of COVID-19 in Australia.

AMARILLO, Texas (KFDA) - NewsChannel 10 Sports Anchor Claudia Faust joined the Sod Squad during their final practice of the Texas Collegiate League season. Upon arriving, she was immediately welcomed as the newest practice member of the team. All Sod Squad newcomers throughout the season were asked to introduce themselves by either singing a song or doing a simple dance to help break the ice. After choosing the popular “floss” dance, Faust then moved on to join Ben Rozenblum for a quick batting lesson. After explaining that she preferred to bat left-handed because it felt similar to her backhand in tennis, Faust was ready to take a few swings. After some time in the cage it was important for Faust to get to know her new teammates a bit better. Faust learned that the best dancer on the team is Mitchell Miller and he even showed off his moved. She also learned that Julio and David Marcano are often getting confused for each other by their teammates, and that manager Brett Wellman learned a lot from coaching the Sod Squad. By the end of practice, they were already offering her a starting position. Copyright 2020 KFDA. All rights reserved.

Li Haotong was still smiling, even if others were feeling his pain. One minute he was taking advantage of a big break on a shot into the trees to make birdie and regain the lead on the back nine in the third round of the PGA Championship. The next he was looking up into another tree, wondering if his luck had run out. The first Chinese player to lead a men’s major stumbled down the stretch Saturday after hitting a ball into a tree on the 13th hole and never finding it. Li made double bogey and added two more bogeys coming in for a 3-over 73 that left him four shots back. Now he’ll have to come from well behind in a pack of players in Sunday’s final round if he wants to add the title of first Chinese player to win a men’s major to his resume at Harding Park. It wasn’t enough to wipe the smile on the face of the 25-year-old, who has a reputation among his fellow players — Phil Mickelson in particular — as one of the funniest guys on tour. But it was a major championship wake-up call for a player who plays mainly on the European Tour and hasn’t proven he can win yet at the highest levels of golf. The day before — after Li had shot a 65 to take the midway lead — he was asked how he would react on the weekend to the fact he was on top of the leaderboard in a major. “I don’t even know what I’m going to do,” Li said. “Just play golf, mate.” That worked out well for most of a late afternoon in San Francisco, where the fog came rolling in and the breeze was chilly. Li was steady if nothing else, with a par and a birdie over the first 11 holes to keep a share of the lead. Then he hit a tee shot way right into the towering cypress trees on the par-4 12th, only to see it hit off a tree and bounce dead left back to the edge of the fairway. Li took...

My first kitchen job involved making six gallons of gazpacho every Sunday. This was back when earning your chops meant something, and making that whole batch with just a knife and peeler, no blender, was the most tedious task on my list. It was also the most popular dish on the menu. By the time I'd learned that recipe -- straight out of the "Moosewood Cookbook" -- by heart, I figured I knew everything there was to know about cold Spanish soups.      When I finally made it to Spain, reality set in on many levels. Sangria, it turns out, is just for tourists, while the locals drink a mix of red wine and Sprite called tinto de verano.      Spanish gazpacho, meanwhile, is a lot smoother than my chunky hippie version. And because it's so involved to make, with an entire garden's worth of vegetables to prepare, gazpacho is often reserved for special occasions like Sundays or when company comes over. When the average Spaniard wants to whip up a quick cold soup at home, or have a chilled bowl at the local bar, it's much more likely to be salmorejo.   Just tomatoes, garlic, oil, vinegar, salt and bread crumbs, a much pared-down cast compared to gazpacho, in salmorejo we are free to focus all of our attention on the tomato.      It has a creamy red look, and a body that jiggles like sea foam thanks to the emulsion among tomato, oil and vinegar, and thickened by the tomato-soaked bread. Some recipes call for the "guts" of a baguette; I've also had good luck cutting the edges off a slice of bread -- usually white but whole grain adds a fun heartiness once in a while.      High-acid, normal-looking red tomatoes are traditionally used, but some of my best batches have been mutts, medleys of whatever heirlooms, slicers, cherry and paste tomatoes are getting too soft for salad.      I was in Spain when COVID-19 hit. On the last afternoon before the lockdown, it didn't quite seem real. In Lanjaron, a cute mountain village in Andalusia, it was business and leisure as usual. As my kids enjoyed a playground that would be roped off for months the very next morning, I ducked into a cafe just ahead of a tour bus from Madrid, and ordered a bowl of salmorejo. It came out immediately, garnished with chopped hard boiled egg and jamon -- Spanish cured ham.      I didn't realize it at the time, but that typical bowl of everyday salmorejo would be my last taste of normalcy for months, not to mention my last restaurant meal. Cooped in our rented house during the lockdown, I began to understand the wisdom of keeping a pitcher of salmorejo in the fridge. It was as much an act of preparation for the inevitable heat of the day as a response to the ever-accumulating soft tomatoes and stale bread, one problem solving another.      Here is a boilerplate salmorejo recipe. Tweak it to suit your own whims and tastes -- but only adjust the levels of the called-for ingredients. If you start adding things, you'll have bready gazpacho in no time.      Salmorejo   Serves 4   • 2 pounds tomatoes   • 1/2 cup "bread guts" -- roughly a slice of bread with the crust cut off   • 1 modest sized clove garlic, chopped   • 2 teaspoons sherry vinegar (more to taste if your tomatoes are low-acid)   • ½ teaspoon salt + more to taste   • ½ cup extra virgin olive oil   • Garnish: hard boiled egg, chopped ham, olive oil, parsley, chives      Boil a pot of salted water deep enough to submerge your tomatoes.      While the water heats, cut a cross into the bottom of each tomato to slice the skins. Then chop the bread.      Boil the tomatoes in the water for about 2 minutes, then immediately plunge them into an ice bath until they are completely cool. Remove the tomatoes and pull off the skins. If you want to go the extra mile, cut open the tomatoes and remove the seeds. (And if you want to slack, you can skip peeling the tomatoes).      Liquify the tomatoes in a blender for about 30 seconds. Add the bread and liquify again. Let the blended bread sit for about 5 minutes in the blended tomatoes.      Add the garlic, salt, vinegar and oil. Blend on high for a minute. Check seasonings; blend again if you made any adjustments.      Chill. Garnish with chopped hard boiled egg and jamon if you want to be traditional. More casually, a simple splash of olive oil or sprinkle of fresh parsley will complete the dish.

“If I win, I may extend and terminate,” Trump said, repeating a longtime goal but remaining silent on how he'd fund the Medicare and Social Security benefits that the 7% tax on employee income covers. Employers also pay 7.65% of their payrolls into the funds.
 Both the House and Senate have left Washington, with members sent home on instructions to be ready to return for a vote on an agreement. With no deal in sight, their absence raised the possibility of a prolonged stalemate that stretches well into August and even September.
 Often an impasse in Washington is of little consequence for the public — but not so this time. It would mean more hardship for millions of people who are losing enhanced jobless benefits and further damage for an economy pummeled by the still-raging coronavirus.
 Friday’s negotiations at the Capitol added up to only “a disappointing meeting,” said Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York. He said the White House had rejected an offer by Pelosi, D-Calif., to curb Democratic demands by about $1 trillion. Schumer urged the White House to “negotiate with Democrats and meet us in the middle. Don’t say it’s your way or no way.”
 That Capitol Hill session followed a combative meeting Thursday evening that for the first time cast real doubt on the ability of the Trump administration and Democrats to come together on a fifth COVID-19 response bill.
 Pelosi declared the talks all but dead until Meadows and Mnuchin give ground.
 The breakdown in the negotiations is particularly distressing for schools, which have been counting on billions of dollars from Washington to help with the costs of reopening. But other priorities are also languishing, including a fresh round of $1,200 direct payments to most people, a cash infusion for the struggling Postal Service and money to help states hold elections in November.
 Mnuchin said renewal of a $600-per-week pandemic jobless boost and huge demands by Democrats for aid to state and local governments are the key areas where they are stuck.
 Democrats have offered to reduce her almost $1 trillion demand for state and local governments considerably, but some of Pelosi's proposed cost savings would accrue chiefly because she would shorten the timeframe for benefits like food stamps.
 Pelosi and Schumer continue to insist on a huge aid package to address a surge in cases and deaths, double-digit joblessness and the threat of poverty for millions of the newly unemployed.
 Senate Republicans have been split, with roughly half of Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's rank and file opposed to another rescue bill at all. Four prior coronavirus response bills totaling almost $3 trillion have won approval on bipartisan votes despite intense wrangling, but conservatives have recoiled at the prospect of another Pelosi-brokered agreement with a whopping deficit- financed cost.
 McConnell has kept his distance from the negotiations while coordinating with Mnuchin and Meadows.

Hikers in Las Trampas Regional Wilderness are welcome to enjoy the outskirts of the Eugene O'Neill National Historic Site, but otherwise the Tao House is available only online as visits are canceled due to Contra Costa County's shelter-in-place order.
 To provide fans with a touch of the playwright and his peaceful home in the Danville hills, where he lived from 1937-44, the Eugene O'Neill Foundation, Tao House has been filming videos dubbed "Virtual Gene" and posting them at www.eugeneoneill.org.
 In one short video, artistic director Eric Fraisher Hayes talks about the series. He is in the Old Barn theater, standing before remains of a set of the Pulitzer Prize-winning "Long Day's Journey into Night," written at Tao House.
 "Using various social media platforms we intend to highlight the beauty and the history of Tao House, the power and the poetry of Eugene O'Neill's words as well as the often overlooked ironic wit of America's first great playwright," Hayes says.
 "In the coming months look for virtual contributions from artists, scholars, the national park service as well as general enthusiasts."
 In another video, he announces upcoming online productions of O'Neill plays.
 "With live performances canceled for the foreseeable future, we've been forced to think of new ways to bring you the plays of Eugene O'Neill," Hayes says. "Earlier this year we were scheduled to present some of his one-act plays, also known as 'The Lost Plays.' As we go virtual, we've decided to stick with 'The Lost Plays' as it seems appropriate to do 'lost plays' in this 'lost year' of theater."
 The one-act plays include "The Web," "Abortion" and "Recklessness." Hayes will work with actors in the Old Barn, which will become an open air studio, he explains. After editing, the performances will be presented virtually in a series of rolling premieres starting in late September or early October.
 Some performances may be filmed in the Tao House courtyard if the sound system permits, Hayes adds.
 "As Tao House has been closed to the public for months, and visitors have been deprived or dispossessed of the opportunity to enjoy its beauty and feel its power, we wanted to share a little bit of it with you," he says.
 Another video features Dan McGovern, president of the Eugene O'Neill Foundation Board of Directors, standing in O'Neill's study inside the Tao House.
 "We want to stay in touch with you and that's why we're making these 'Virtual Gene' videos," McGovern says. "And we want to continue to bring great theater to you."
 Other short films are "A Short Hiking Tour of Tao House" by board member John Barry, and "10 Essential Tips on Visiting Tao House" by Teresa and Dan Morley.
 "Like everyone we are facing new challenges, but I like to think of it as an opportunity," Hayes says.

The Victorian government is investing $60 million to keep people suffering acute mental illness at home and away from the stress of emergency departments during the pandemic.
 There has been a 33 per cent increase in hospital presentations for self-harm among people under the age of 18 over the past year.
 Minister for Mental Health Martin Foley announced a $59.7 million package to focus on acute, clinical services in both hospitals and the community.
 "We know that particularly at the moment, we want to keep those people with mental illness away from emergency departments," he told reporters on Sunday.
 "That is better in terms of treatment for those people, and more importantly, it frees up the resources in our emergency departments as well."
 Part of the funding will go to extending community mental health programs to seven days a week, rather than Monday to Friday, and with longer opening hours to provide psychiatric, allied healthcare and data support.
 It will also pay for outreach programs run by Melbourne's 15 Headspace centres, which can identify those at the acute end of the mental health spectrum and deliver help within their neighbourhood.
 Premier Daniel Andrews said the government had put $250,000 towards a counselling service for nurses, midwives and personal care workers.
 "It's a very small amount of money in the overall scheme of things."
 "We know Victorians are resilient, but we have never faced a crisis quite like this one and I know there are a lot of people out there doing it tough right now. We want them to know that they are not alone.
 The funds will also fast-track two recommendations of the interim report from the royal commission into mental health, Mr Andrews said.
 An extra 144 acute mental health beds will be rolled out at Box Hill, The Royal Melbourne Hospital, Monash Clayton, Heidelberg and Broadmeadows, Warrnambool and Mildura.
 The remainder will be spent on Orygen's Hospital in the Home and post-hospital suicide prevention program, HOPE.
 Currently up and running in 16 of the state's 23 mental health regions, they have accelerated the roll-out in the remaining seven areas to help young people and their families get back on track as soon as possible, Mr Foley said.
 "We know that the greatest indicator - to prevent someone's suicide is to deal with that person in the community - when they've expressed suicide ideas or attempted suicide in the past."

So far, she and a few others have made about 300 masks.Americans like Treadwell have received packages like these.“The problem that we have is when they’ve actually sent merchandise to an address that did not order it,” said Tony Robinson with the Postal Inspection Service.Robinson said packages like these could be part of a scam.“There are scammers who will send items to unsuspecting customers, and then come back later on and try to collect money for those packages as if they owed something for them,” he said.There are several different scams related to unordered packages.“The other caveat is you may have a customer that orders something from a company and the company, instead of sending the item to the address of the customer, they send it through to a third party, but instead of the actual merchandise, they send trinkets,” he said.Robinson says to contact the postal inspectors if someone receives a package they think is part of a fraud scheme. He said they use these reports to investigate the fraud cases. Robinson said to call 877-876-2455 or go to ftc.gov. He also said someone can turn down an unopened package.Copyright 2020 WSFA 12 News.

SAN FRANCISCO — Dustin Johnson supplied the birdies, eight of them Saturday at the PGA Championship, the most he has ever made in his 157 rounds of major championship golf for a 5-under 65 and a one-shot lead.
 Brooks Koepka supplied the needle.
 Koepka recovered from three straight bogeys to salvage a 69 and stay within two shots of a leaderboard more crowded than any of San Francisco's congested highways. At stake is a chance to become only the seventh player to win the same major three straight times. He surveyed the cast of contenders, and focused on the guy at the top.
 “I like my chances,” Koepka said. “When I've been in this position before, I've capitalized. He's only won one. I'm playing good. I don't know, we'll see.”
 As he stepped away from the microphone, Koepka smiled and said to Jason Day, “How about that shade?” They laughed.
 Too bad this isn't a two-man show.
 The final round at Harding Park figures to be wide open, just like it was on a Saturday so wild that eight players had at least a share of the lead during the third round.
 Johnson lost his yardage book and still found his way through an enormous crowd of contenders. He made a double bogey on the ninth hole and still bounced back with a 31 on the tough, windy back nine.
 He needed all eight of those birdies on a day of low scores, long putts and endless possibilities.
 One possibility is Koepka hoisting the Wanamaker Trophy for the third straight year, which hasn’t happened since Walter Hagen won four in a row in the 1920s when it was match play. The last player to win any major three straight times was Peter Thomson at the British Open in 1956.
 Koepka was two shots behind on a board that features only two major champions among the top six.
 Scottie Scheffler, the PGA Tour rookie from Texas, ran off three straight birdies only to miss a 6-foot par putt on the final hole. He still shot a 65 and was one shot behind, in the final group at his first PGA Championship. Cameron Champ, who has the most powerful swing on tour, shot 67 and joined Scheffler one shot behind.
 Johnson was at 9-under 201 as he goes for his second major title. For all the chances he has had, this is only the second time he has led going into the final round. The other was down the coast at Pebble Beach, his first chance at winning a major. He had a three-shot lead in the 2010 U.S. Open and shot 82.
 Now he is more seasoned with experiences good (21 tour victories) and bad (five close calls in the majors).
 “I'm going to have to play good golf if I want to win. It's simple,” Johnson said. “I've got to hit a lot of fairways and a lot of greens. If I can do that tomorrow, I'm going to have a good chance coming down the stretch. ... I'm just going to have to do what I did today. Just get it done."
 Among the cast of contenders are major champions like Koepka, Jason Day and Justin Rose, and fresh faces like Scheffler, Champ and Collin Morikawa. Also right there was Bryson DeChambeau, thanks to a 95-foot putt for birdie on his last hole. Turns out he can hit long putts, too.
 Missing from all this action is Tiger Woods, who didn't make a birdie until the 16th hole and is out of the mix for the fourth straight major since his emotional Masters victory last year.
 A dozen players were separated by three shots.
 Li Haotong, the first player from China to lead after any round at a major, was leading through 12 holes until his tee shot didn't come down from a tree. He made double bogey, dropped two more shots and finished four shots out of the lead.
 Johnson didn't have smooth sailing, either, especially when he couldn't find his yardage book.
 He thinks it slipped into the bottom of the golf bag, and he didn't feel like dumping his 14 clubs all over the ground to find it. Austin Johnson, his brother and caddie, had a spare yardage book.
 Johnson shot 65 even with a double bogey on the ninth hole. Mistakes like that might be more costly on Sunday with so many players in the mix. Even those who struggled — Rose, Daniel Berger, Tommy Fleetwood all settled for 70 — are only three shots behind.
 Adding to the drama will be the lack of atmosphere, this being the first major without spectators. Paul Casey said he still didn't feel nerves from the lack of people. Perhaps that helps with younger players in the hunt for the first time. It also could make it difficult for players to know what's happening around them without any cheers.
 Then again, Johnson won the U.S. Open in 2016 at Oakmont without knowing the score as the USGA tried to decide whether he should be penalized for a potential rules violation earlier in the round. He had to play the last seven holes without knowing his score.
 It's just one example of what Johnson has endured in the majors. There was a penalty that knocked him out of a playoff in the 2010 PGA at Whistling Straits for grounding his club in sand without realizing it was a bunker. He had a 12-foot eagle putt to win the 2015 U.S. Open at Chambers Bay, only to three- putt for par and a silver medal.
 But he's back for another shot, and his game looks to be in order. He has the power, and on this day, he had the putting.
 “I definitely have experience in this situation that definitely will help tomorrow,” Johnson said. “I’ve been in the hunt a bunch of times in a major. I’ve got one major. ... Still going to have to go out and play really good golf.”

The current plan in District 91 has three tiers for classroom organization, depending on the prevalence of COVID-19 in Bonneville County and the district. In the green “new normal” approach, all classes will be held in person with adjustments made to allow for social distancing and keep students in smaller cohorts. Students are encouraged to wear masks and staff members working closely with students are encouraged to wear face shields, though neither is currently required.
 More restricted is the yellow “hybrid” approach, where students attend school on either Monday-Wednesday or Tuesday-Thursday, with online lessons the other two days and teacher development or student interventions held on Fridays. Moving to this approach could be done district-wide or at the individual school level, based on unspecified “guidance from health officials.” The district could also enforce a third phase, coded red, to move all lessons online in the event of a more serious outbreak.
 An all-online school option for students, D91 Virtual Academy, has been in the works by the district throughout the summer but details about how the online school will operate have not yet been made public.

A resurgent Jason Day says he is thrilled at having a chance to win an elusive second major after golf's cream rose to the top during a dramatic third round at the US PGA Championship.
 Day is among a stack of big names who have set the stage for an exciting finish to the first major of a year ravaged by COVID-19.
 It wasn't easy for Day, who barely held on during a lacklustre, even-par 70 on day three but, at six under, he will start Monday morning's final round just three shots off the pace.
 Dustin Johnson took the 54-hole lead at San Francisco's TPC Harding Park with a superb 65 that also has him poised to capture a second major to go with his 2016 US Open title.
 At nine under, big-hitting Johnson will take a one-shot lead over fellow Americans Scottie Scheffler (65) and the powerful Cameron Champ (67).
 Defending champion Brooks Koepka (69), Collin Morikawa (65) and England veteran Paul Casey (68) are seven under.
 Bryson DeChambeau (66), Tony Finau (67), Justin Rose (70) and Daniel Berger (70) are tied with Day at six under.
 Day, the 2015 PGA champion, has not been in contention on golf's biggest stage since the 2019 Masters at Augusta National.
 The 32-year-old found form recently with three top-10 results on the US PGA Tour leading into the PGA Championship.
 He is hungry to go the next level.
 "It's just nice to be able to be in contention at a major championship again and know that your game is good enough to get in contention," Day said.
 "We haven't played a major in ages. It's strange, but I'm excited to be here."
 Day is also buoyed by the chance to become Australia's first male winner of multiple majors since Greg Norman captured a second British Open title in 1993.
 But Day he will try to ignore that milestone and the leaders on the final day at Harding Park.
 "I won't focus on the lead at all," he said.
 "If I can walk off at the end of the day knowing I gave everything, then I'll be happy. Hopefully it's enough to win."
 Day faces a stern challenge in reeling in Johnson, who bounced back from a double-bogey at the ninth with four back-nine birdies.
 Johnson's world-class driving is tailor-made for major championships, having finished runner-up in the Masters (2019), British Open (2011) and last year's PGA.
 "I definitely have experience in this situation that definitely will help tomorrow," Johnson said.
 But four-time major winner Koepka, seeking to win a third successive PGA Championship, questioned Johnson's ability to close.
 "I like my chances; when I've been in this position before, I've capitalised," Koepka said of Johnson. "He's only won one."
 Australian world No.9 Adam Scott squandered a chance to make ground when a flat, even-par 70 left him at two under while countryman Cameron Smith (70) finished at even par.
 Four-time PGA champion Tiger Woods (72, two over) is well out of contention for a 16th major championship win.

Geelong coach Chris Scott has given Jack Steven the green light to take on his former AFL club for the first time when the Cats meet St Kilda on Monday night.
 Both sides are coming off short breaks for the Gabba contest, which will have huge ramifications for their respective top-four hopes.
 Steven has struggled for consistency this season after an interrupted preparation for the restart but impressed with 21 disposals on his latest return in a win over North Melbourne on Wednesday.
 Scott said the midfielder has recovered well, however, there are still questions over how Steven will confront the emotional side of a game against the club with which he won four best-and-fairest awards in 11 seasons.
 "There's absolutely no ill will towards St Kilda and I suspect they're the same," Scott said.
 "I don't know for sure, but that's my suspicion.
 "As much as we say it's another game, he knows them well.
 "Probably there's a little bit of extra spice there but not malicious spice."
 Steven missed a large part of last season with St Kilda as he dealt with mental health issues before successfully requesting a trade to Geelong.
 The 30-year-old was cleared of wrongdoing over an off-field incident in May, when he was stabbed in the chest, and the Cats conceded he was underdone on his return to action in June.
 Scott tipped Steven will hit his straps later in the season.
 "He's in a better place but I suspect he'll be in a better place in four weeks and eight weeks' time as well," Scott said.
 "There was the obvious incident that Jack had, but much more important than that was the fact that he hadn't played footy for two years, for reasons that took on greater importance than just getting right for footy."
 Scott has committed to rotating his squad heavily throughout the compressed part of the 2020 fixture and tipped another handful of changes for the St Kilda clash.
 Brandon Parfitt, Esava Ratugolea, Jake Kolodjashnij and Gary Rohan were all rested against North Melbourne but will come into calculations to play against the Saints.

BENTON HARBOR, MI (WBND) -- While gyms remain closed in Michigan, a new, outdoor fitness park in Berrien County will allow you to be active while staying safe during the pandemic.
 The Woods is a 20-acre gym in Benton Harbor and has only been in business for a month – but given the urge people now have to get outside and social distance, the opening came at a perfect time.

Smith called that irrelevant, pointing out court cases which already say that medical marijuana patients with metabolites in their blood, evidence of earlier usage, can’t be convicted of driving under the influence of drugs absent a showing of impairment.
 “An elector signing a petition to legalize recreational marijuana would more likely be surprised if the initiative did not decriminalize driving with any amount of metabolite in one’s system,” Smith wrote, just as people can’t be convicted of drunk driving simply because there are metabolites of alcohol in their blood.

PHOENIX — Voters who signed petitions to legalize the recreational use of marijuana were not misled, Maricopa County Superior Court Judge James Smith ruled late Friday, and the measure can be on the ballot.
 In a 15-page ruling, Smith rejected claims by Arizonans for Responsible Drug Policy that the 100-word summary on the initiative omitted principal provisions and was misleading.
 “At 100 words, the summary also cannot include everything,” he wrote. “that is why the full initiative must accompany the petition.”
 And Smith chided foes for suggesting that voters might not understand all the implications of what the measure would do, things like changing laws on advertising and altering laws on driving under the influence of drugs.

The spread of COVID-19 has slowed in Arizona and Pima County since the number of cases peaked in late June, but the risk level remains elevated throughout the state, several data points suggest.
 Despite recent improvements in COVID-19 trends, public health experts warn that these trends could easily worsen if Arizonans don’t continue to take the pandemic seriously.
 “We are by no extent of the imagination out of the woods,” said Dr. Francisco Garcia, Pima County’s chief medical officer. “We need to continue to double down on our mitigation strategies.”
 The number of new, confirmed countywide and statewide COVID-19 cases recently declined again from one week to the next.
 A simultaneous decrease in diagnostic testing could have reduced the number of new, confirmed cases, but the percentage of tests turning up positive for COVID-19 also decreased, which suggests the virus may be spreading less, Dr. Joshua LaBaer, executive director of Arizona State University’s Biodesign Institute, said on a conference call Wednesday.

NORMAN — With the date of their season opener up in the air, OU has paused preseason camp.
 Sooners coach Lincoln Riley announced the move Saturday night.
 Players have been allowed to go home for the week before returning Friday.
 "We decided it's best to give our players some time off," Riley said in a release. "We were able to start camp before the vast majority of teams because our Aug. 29 season-opening game was the earliest in the country. With that first game pushed back a week or two, it only makes sense to spread out our practices and give our guys some time away."

He later walked back the comment.
 Black voters as a whole delivered the Democratic nomination to Biden, powering his commanding win in the South Carolina primary, which rescued his floundering campaign. But that success was heavily dependent on older Black voters. In a general election where Democrats say no vote can be taken for granted, young Black activists and elected officials say this week’s missteps could make it harder to get their vote.
 “Trump is terrible, and he’s a racist, and we have to get racists out of the White House. But then Biden keeps saying racist things,” said Mariah Parker, a 28-year-old county commissioner in Athens, Georgia. “It doesn’t make me feel much better that we actually will have an improvement for the Black community with one president over the other.”
 Most Black voters view Trump as someone who exacerbates racial tensions and are unlikely to support his campaign in large numbers. But those who sit out the presidential election could sway the outcome in closely contested states.
 AP VoteCast data illustrates the generational divide Biden is confronting.
 Across 17 states where AP VoteCast surveyed Democratic voters during the primary, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders won 60% of voters under 30 overall, to Biden’s 19%. And while Biden was strongly supported by African American voters overall, Black voters under age 30 were slightly more likely to support Sanders than Biden, 44% to 38%.
 A Washington Post-Ipsos poll conducted in June suggested that while Biden had majority support among Black voters aged 18-39, there was skepticism about Biden himself. Among Black Americans under age 40 that were polled, 32% said they didn’t feel he was sympathetic to the problems of Black people. And 24% of respondents under 40 said they felt Biden is “biased” against Black people, in contrast to much lower percentages for middle-aged and senior respondents.
 Part of the challenge for Biden, said activist Kristin Fulwylie Thomas, is the perception among young Black voters that he’s too moderate to deliver on issues that are important to them. The 31-year-old managing director of Equal Ground, an Orlando-based group working to boost turnout among Black voters across Florida, said she hears this concern from voters across the state.
 “What I’m seeing and what I’m hearing among young black voters is that Biden was not their first choice, so folks are not excited to vote for him this November,” she said.
 Every gaffe makes it harder for Biden to generate that excitement.
 Michigan State Rep. Jewell Jones, 25, said that he’s seen a number of Biden’s comments on Black voters, along with his past support for the 1994 crime bill that contributed to mass incarceration of Black Americans, pop up on social media and raise questions among his peers.
 “Young people are really holding people accountable these days,” he said. “Anything that comes up that they think is questionable, they’ll challenge.”
 Jones said the issue with young Black voters is “not necessarily skepticism about whether or not he’s able to do the job.”
 “Young people today want to know, are politicians’ hearts in the right place?” he said.
 The Biden campaign says they’re working hard to reach out to young Black voters, and point to events hosted by their young voter outreach coalition, League 46, as well as outreach geared specifically towards historically Black colleges and universities and Black sororities.
 Pennsylvania State Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta, who is 30, pointed to Biden’s clarification as a key difference between the former vice president and Trump.
 “It’s such a contrast to actually have a leader, and hopefully a president, that’s going to hold himself to a high standard,” he said.
 Kenyatta, who has endorsed Biden, said he’s spoken to the former vice president about issues affecting young people and that “his ability to listen and understand that, and then put forward policy that addresses those concerns is going to be pivotal to us.”
 Indeed, Biden has put out proposals focused on Black economic mobility, which include pledges to steer federal money and tax credits to small business and economic development programs for minority-owned firms and disadvantaged neighborhoods.
 On criminal justice reform, he’s called for a federal ban on police choke holds, national standards for police use of force, and a new federal police oversight commission. He’s also embraced proposals to forgive some student loan debt and offer some free college.
 But on a number of key issues being pushed by some young Black activists — like defunding or dismantling police forces, Medicare for All, and legalizing marijuana — Biden has thus far declined to embrace the most progressive policies.
 Some of the enthusiasm gap has to do with a generational split on voting within the Black community that has little to do with Biden, said Leah Daughtry, a Black operative who has twice served as CEO of the Democratic National Convention.
 “For my generation and older, voting was this thing that was this great privilege because we didn’t always have it,” she said, noting that at 55, she was part of the first generation of Black women to get the right to vote. For younger Black Americans, “they don’t have the lived experience of not being able to.”
 Daughtry said that she was willing to give Biden “a pass” on his comments after listening to the full interview, but young voters might not be so forgiving.
 “For young people — when they see the one quote it would appear to confirm to them, or solidify questions in their mind about the vice president’s intent and goals,” she said. “And the best we can hope for is they will do further research. At worst you have some who will say it adds to their reasons for disillusionment.”

These stereotypes about motorcyclists can cause real legal damage in cases where riders are blamed for accidents that they didn't actually cause. In many cases, these false accusations add insult to injury for riders and their families when the accident causes serious physical damage, as is often the case in accidents involving motorcycles.
