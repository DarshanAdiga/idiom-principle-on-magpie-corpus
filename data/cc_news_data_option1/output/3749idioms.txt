 "Thank you RBG," one sign read. On the sidewalk, "RBG" was drawn inside a pink chalk heart.

Homegating allows you to support your favorite team from the comfort of your home! It is a convenient, safe, and less expensive way to gather family and friends to be a part of your favorite sporting event.

 While you can make the homegate as fancy or low key as you want, remember that food safety is still a key component. With ready access to your kitchen and everything you need for planning, preparing, and serving the gang at your fingertips, the task is much easier!

"First of all, if you told that young man, that kid that he was 17 and he'd be the MVP player that I would be in this position right now seven years later being the back-to-back MVP, defensive player of the year in the same year… you know, who ever would have to be that crazy. I'm extremely proud. I'm extremely proud for what I've accomplished, from where I was to where I am, where I came from. It's been an unbelievable journey. Nobody would ever have imagined this. Not me, not even myself when I got to the league but at the end of the day there's no emotion. You can't put emotion into this. You've got to keep getting better. My younger self would probably tell myself right now I'm extremely proud of what you've accomplished, but you're not done yet. You're not done yet. The goal is always to be the best. The goal is always to win the championship. The goal is always to make your team successful. I think my younger self would tell myself right now that."

AKRON Amazon will begin accepting online applications Friday morning for 1,500 openings at its new fulfillment center in Akron on the site of the former Rolling Acres Mall.
   
 People can apply by going to amazon.com/clevelandjobs. Job candidates must be 18 years or older and have a high school diploma or equivalent to be considered.
   
 Amazon said jobs are available on a rolling basis and typically fill up quickly. The company said it encourages people to sign up for text alerts for regular updates by texting AKCNOW to 77088 to receive automated messages about job openings. To learn more and apply online, visit here.
   
 The company provides minimum pay of $15 an hour plus benefits.
   
 The company earlier this week said it expected to begin hiring for the massive fulfillment center beginning in early fall. Instead, with this announcement it sped up the timeline. Amazon said once it begins hiring it typically starts operations at new fulfillment centers within one to two months.
   
 Akron fulfillment center employees will work alongside robots and other automated machinery to receive inventory, pick and ship customer orders, and support network logistics, Amazon said in a news release. The company said it has put into place measures to protect employees during the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic.
   
 The jobs at the 2.7 million square foot multi-story plant are expected to provide an economic boost to the city and surrounding region, including revitalizing the Romig Road corridor that declined with the demise of the former Rolling Acres Mall. The city has said it wants as many Akron residents as possible get jobs there.
   
 Amazon since 2010 said it has created more than 23,500 jobs in Ohio and invested more than $5.9 billion across the state. It now has eight fulfillment and sortation centers, six delivery stations, an air hub, 12 Whole Foods Market locations, four Amazon Hub Locker+ locations and a wind farm.
   
 Full-time employee benefits include health, vision and dental insurance, 401(k) with 50 percent company match and up to 20 weeks paid parental leave. The company also offers what it calls the Career Choice program, which pre- pays 95% of tuition for courses in high-demand fields.
   
 In addition, Amazon has pledged to invest more than $700 million to provide training for 100,000 U.S. employees for in-demand jobs. Programs will help Amazon employees access training to move into what it calls highly skilled roles in the company's corporate offices, tech hubs, fulfillment centers, retails stores, and transportation network, or pursue career paths outside of Amazon.

 # 1918 flu pandemic experience depicted in Shreveport exhibition
 Shreveport Times
 The Centenary College of Louisiana Archives and Special Collections presents the exhibit 1918 Flu Pandemic. It highlights examples of how the 1918 flu pandemic affected people connected to Centenary College as well as Louisiana Methodism. The exhibit is accessible online and is also on display in the College's Whited Room lobby of Bynum Commons.
 "In light of the current COVID-19 pandemic, we wanted to show how people dealt with and documented the 1918 flu pandemic,” said archivist Chris Brown. "There are many familiar themes: closing public places, product shortages, tragic deaths, and inspiring stories from health care workers."
 Archives student workers Celeste Muniz, Tori Reich, and Chris Willie helped research and prepare the exhibit.
 “I learned that the 1918 Flu epidemic wasn’t so different compared to what we are going through now,” Reich said. “A surprising thing about this was some of the cures and preventions that were being posted in the papers were actually posted without knowing if they worked. Students were being sent home, and school was shut down for them just like it was for us at the end of the last school year.”
 The mission of the Centenary College Archives and Special Collections is to collect, preserve, and make available the historic records of the College and the Louisiana Annual Conference of the United Methodist Church. For more information, contact Chris Brown at (318) 869-5462 or archives@centenary.edu.

The 101-unit Residences at East Milton apartments recently received key preliminary state approval that clears the way for the developers — the Joseph J. Corcoran Company and the Falconi Companies — to file for 40B approval from the town.
 MassHousing issued preliminary site approval on Aug. 31 for the development bounded by Adams Court and Bassett, Franklin, and Adams streets in the heart of East Milton Square.
 The development, which will include 26 affordable units, has met with opposition from town officials and area residents whose concerns include the size and scale of the proposed five-story development as well as its impact on traffic, parking, pedestrians and stormwater.
 The next step for the developers would be to apply to the town Zoning Board of Appeals for a comprehensive permit under the state’s 40B zoning laws, and a spokeswoman for the project said that could be forthcoming within a matter of weeks.
 In issuing the approval, MassHousing noted that despite recent efforts, Milton still has a long way to go before meeting the mandated number of affordable housing units required to be in compliance with the state’s comprehensive permitting laws that mandate 10 percent of housing meet affordability standards.
 Under the regional planning mandate, Milton would need to have an additional 484 units of affordable housing.

The Steelers usually have a few cap casualties ahead of the start of every league year and 2021 isn't likely to be any different. As we sit here in September, Vance McDonald ($5,200,000), Vince Williams ($4,000,000) and Stefen Wisniewski ($1,425,000) are all prime candidates to have their contracts terminated within a few months after the 2020 season ends. Magically, the cap savings produced by terminating the contracts of those three players is $10,625,000, which is a little more than the 10 million estimated needed amount. Should any of those three players wish to remain in Pittsburgh, they would likely need to consider dropping the 2021 base salaries down to the minimums. Depending on how Eric Ebron fares in 2020, it's worth noting that he could also wind up being a spring cap casualty. If that were to happen, another $6 million in cap space would be instantly cleared.
