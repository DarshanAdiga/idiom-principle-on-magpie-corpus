Now in the Camp Nou hot seat, Setien arrived at Barcelona after seven months without a job, then having last coached Real Betis.


  During the period of unemployment, he was getting ready to start work with an unnamed Egyptian club when Barca contacted him.


  “Days before Barcelona called me, I was about to leave to coach in Egypt,” Setien told El Larguero as per Marca.


  “I would've coached Barcelona for free. Well, maybe not for free, but in almost any circumstance.”


  Former Pyramids FC owner Turki Al-Sheikh says Setien had already signed a contract with the unnamed Egyptian club which he was about to own and the Spaniard was just three days away from starting work, before abandoning a move to Africa.


  Al-Sheikh dismissed speculation from a section of the Egyptian media that Setien was about to join Pyramids.


  “Setien was not about to work at Pyramids FC. The story, in a nutshell, was that I was about to own an Egyptian club and he would have been the coach and we had signed the contract,” Al-Sheikh posted on social media.

Nearly 400 Rohingya refugees who left Bangladesh by boat nearly two months ago have been rescued at sea, the Bangladesh Coast Guard has said, while confirming that at least 32 people died on the journey.
 The group, consisting mostly of women and children, set out in the Bay of Bengal on a large fishing trawler in mid-February, Bangladesh Coast Guard spokesman Hamidul Islam told CNN. They tried to reach Malaysia but were turned back, he said. The rescue took place on Wednesday or Thursday.
 At least 32 people died and their bodies were thrown into the sea, Islam said, citing statements from the rescued refugees. "The deaths were due to several causes. Some died due to lack of food while some due to various illnesses," he said.

RALEIGH — Republican lawmakers are considering temporarily expanding Medicaid to cover uninsured residents’ coronavirus testing and treatment, House Speaker Tim Moore, R-Cleveland, said during a meeting of the House Committee on COVID-19 Health Care Working Group.
 Medicaid expansion derailed last year’s budget, after Gov. Roy Cooper vetoed the $24 billion 2019-20 spending plan last summer. The Republican-led House overrode the veto, but the budget remains locked in the stalemate in the Senate. A Republican version of Medicaid expansion surfaced on the House calendar, but never got a floor vote. Other states saw courts strike down their Medicaid expansion work requirements, weakening support for the GOP version of Medicaid expansion.
 But Republican leaders in the House are now considering using Medicaid to cover uninsured people’s coronavirus testing and treatment for confirmed cases of the virus.

"My team is not as weak as you guys think," the coach told reporters as he basked in the glory of Wednesday's 1-1 draw with former champions Morocco in Durban.


  Added to the point they picked up in unexpectedly holding hosts South Africa in last weekend's opening game, the smallest country to ever compete now have a realistic chance of reaching the quarter-finals.


  "We have won both home and away against some good teams in the past and even held Portugal to a draw away a few years ago. We are strong home and away and we've got some fantastic players," Antunes said.


  "We showed we have a great collection of players like South Africa, Morocco, Nigeria, the Ivory Coast, Ghana," he said, smiling as the names rolled off his tongue.


  "My players can play at Chelsea, Manchester United, Milan, Real Madrid, Barcelona. They can go there."


  A late equaliser from Morocco denied the Cape Verdians a memorable win but the islanders did score their first ever tournament goal in a performance that belied their inexperience and profile.


  "It was a night to congratulate Cape Verde football, a big night for our country. It was a just result and now we have a chance to progress.


  "I'm very happy with a night of great dignity for our football and I must offer congratulations to my players. We have the respect of all now because we play good football," Antunes said.


  Cape Verde might now qualify even if they do not beat Angola in their last group game on Sunday. A draw would suffice if South Africa beat Morocco in the other Group A match being played at the same time.


  Antunes warned the fairytale could have a horror ending.


  "You haven't seen the real Angola yet, they are a very strong side."


  With a population of just over 500 000, Cape Verde caused a sensation by beating four-time winners Cameroon on aggregate in the qualifiers last year.


  The team, nicknamed "Tubaroes Azul" (blue sharks), have rocketed up the FIFA rankings over the last decade from to 182nd in 2000 to 51 last October.

The ANC in the Eastern Cape says it is shocked by the arrest of Chris Hani District Municipality councillor Madoda Papiyana.


  Papiyana, who is also ANC chief whip in the district, was arrested on Friday for driving under the influence of alcohol and for failing to uphold the lockdown regulations.


  EWN earlier reported that it is alleged that Papiyana refused to stop at a police roadblock.


  His car was chased down and he was stopped in the Ngcobo area.


  Papiyana appeared to be under the influence of alcohol.


  Eastern Cape ANC provincial secretary Lulama Ngcukayitobi said they were shocked by Papiyana's arrest, and particularly by the seriousness of allegations leveled against him - undermining the rule of law, driving under the influence of alcohol and abusing his permit immunity to free movement around the district.


  Ngcukayitobi said provincial executive committee officials had held a teleconference on Saturday discussing Papiyana's conduct.


  ".... the meeting reiterated the importance of all ANC members and its deployees to lead by example, to examine their actions and ensure that they are in line with the character set out in policies and ANC constitution.


  "PEC officials resolved to exercise their right as enshrined in the ANC Constitution and institute internal disciplinary processes. Details of which will be communicated within 72 hours.


  "We strongly condemn any behaviour inconsistent with the character of the movement and further make an appeal to all ANC members and its deployees to refrain from behaving in a disgraceful and disorderly manner, and uphold the good name of our organisation.


  "We can't expect the society to behave in an exemplary way if those in leadership positions behave as if they are a law unto themselves," Ngcukayitobi said.

Gurugram After a gap of 25 days the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) will resume operations of the Kherki-Daula toll plaza from April 20 when the central government's curbs on movement will be partially relaxed. An NHAI official said all 25 lanes at the plaza will be operational and revised toll fee will be collected from commercial vehicles. The single passage toll rate for cars hasn't been changed. However, trucks and buses will have to pay ₹5 more from April 1 -- for mini trucks this will ₹95, and for trucks and buses, it will be ₹200. Toll collection was temporarily suspended at all toll plazas across the country on March 25 with lockdown in place. Ashok Sharma, project director, NHAI Gurugram, said, "Toll collection at Kherki-Daula toll plaza will start again from April 20. The toll will be collected from all lanes."Officials of Millennium City Expressway Pvt Ltd (MCEPL), concessionaire of Kherki-Daula toll plaza said that around 90 toll booth operators are lodged in a guest house near Kherki-Daula and will start work from Monday. Anish John, systems manager, MCEPL, said, "All the staff have been out up in a guest house and will resume work from April 20. We will ensure that each toll booth operator wears masks, gloves and has sanitiser in their booth."Akhilesh Srivastava, chief general manager, NHAI, wrote to all regional offices and project directors on April 17 to resume collection of user fee at national highway. "As per the directions of ministry of road transport and highways (MoRTH) the collection of user fee was temporarily suspended at all national highways fee plazas (sic)," read the letter.On April 17, MoRTH had asked NHAI to take necessary actions for compliance of the orders of ministry of home affairs on April 15 to resume toll operations. "In view of the above necessary instruction be issued to all user fee collection agencies to resume collection of user fee at all fee plazas on national highways from April 20 (sic)," read the letter.NHAI has also maintained that they will be taking all precautionary measures while dealing with toll operations once the toll operations start from Monday. The NHAI letter states that all toll booth operators will maintain the required social distance while collecting toll. "By ensuring social distancing, sanitisation, frequent washing of hands, putting up masks hand gloves and other preventive measures in terms of the guidelines/instructions issued by the government of India to contain spread of COVID-19. FASTag/electronic toll collection system should be promoted to the maximum to avoid direct human involvement (sic)," read the letter, a copy of which is with HT.Unlike the national highway toll operations which will resume operations from Monday across the country, toll plazas managed by the state government will remain closed till May 3 including the Gurgaon-Faridabad toll. All 15 toll collection points operated by Public Works Department (PWD) will remain shut for the second half of lockdown.

So often seen celebrating last-gasp goals like a schoolboy, Ferguson watched as Clint Dempsey swept in Tottenham's equaliser three minutes into stoppage time after Robin van Persie had given United the lead midway through the first half.
 Ferguson appeared happy enough with a point after testing afternoon in freezing North London, although he offered an icy blast towards the match officials after United had not been awarded a penalty when substitute Wayne Rooney was tripped in the area by Steven Caulker.
 Demonstrating a photographic memory when it comes to match officials, the 71-year-old picked on assistant referee Simon Beck for not awarding United the spot kick that could have sealed the victory.
 "It was a clear penalty kick on Wayne Rooney but in no way was the linesman going to give that," he told Sky Sports.
 "He gave them everything else. We have not had a good record with this linesman, against Chelsea a few years ago he gave onside to Didier Drogba who was three yards offside, you remember those things."
 United appeared to be heading for the kind of 1-0 victory they say title- winners grind out.
 Rock solid at the back where Nemanja Vidic and Rio Ferdinand were magnificent and dogged in midfield with former Spurs player Michael Carrick breaking up attack after attack, United appeared to have weathered the storm until Dempsey found a chink in the armour to snatch a deserved point for the home side.
 "We did so well at everything and we kept heading it out, the disappointment is not finishing them off," said Ferguson, whose side begin the final 15 games of the season with a five-point lead over Manchester City.
 "We had a lot of opportunities on the counter attack but our final ball let us down.
 "Tottenham were very committed and aggressive. They worked their socks off and you've got to credit them for that. They kept pumping the ball in the box and got their reward."
 United have been free-scoring this season, netting 56 in 22 games before the trip to White Hart Lane. But this was a rugged defensive display after Van Persie's 18th league goal of the season had given United a 25th minute lead.
 David de Gea denied Gareth Bale and Dempsey with his legs and Vidic nicked the ball from Jermain Defoe seemed poised to shoot in the second half.
 United forced Bale to drop deeper and deeper to try and get the ball and while Tottenham enjoyed 61 percent of possession they appeared to have run out of steam.
 Tottenham manager Andre Villas-Boas' side have lost only once in 11 league games and Sunday's draw, following up on the 3-2 win they achieved at Old Trafford in September, will fuel confidence that they can finish in the top four.
 "It was a big relief. I thought we dominated the complete game," the Portuguese, who has impressed in his first season at White Hart Lane, said.
 "We could not get in behind them a lot but had 15 opportunities. We have talented players and we gave them different problems, the team came out very strong in the second half.

"We understand these men, women and children were at sea for nearly two months in harrowing conditions and that many of them are extremely malnourished and dehydrated," an official with the UN's refugee agency in Bangladesh said in a statement.
 It added that the refugees disembarked from a distressed boat near Teknaf on Wednesday, close to the border with Myanmar.
 "We dispatched staff to the site Thursday and are seeking further information from local authorities. Our primary concern is for people's immediate health and first aid needs. NGOs and partners on the ground have been providing food and other support overnight," the statement continued.
 In early April, Bangladesh imposed lockdown restrictions in Cox's Bazar district, home to refugee camps housing around 1 million Rohingya refugees, in a bid to prevent the spread of coronavirus.
 As of April 17, Bangladesh had 2,144 Covid-19 cases with 84 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University.
 Human Rights Watch urged Malaysia to allow Rohingya refugees ashore while putting in place systems to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.
 "The Covid-19 pandemic has only intensified the misery of the Rohingya confined in Myanmar and in camps in Bangladesh," said Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch.
 "The Malaysian government can both protect against the spread of the virus and ensure that those risking their lives at sea are rescued and given a chance to seek asylum."

Human adaptability is encouraging.
 Six weeks ago, people still went to work and the gym and the grocery store. Almost no one outside the tech world had ever heard of Zoom.
 Now the world has changed in unimaginable ways. Social distancing rules our lives and Zoom has become an invaluable way to connect people. It’s an app that permits virtual gatherings  — face-to-face encounters on your device for business meetings, family events and friend gatherings.
 The number of people who have downloaded the Zoom app has increased about 700% since we all went into lockdown, according to _Drift.com ._
 The speed with which the video chat service was picked up for use — almost overnight — by millions of people is an interesting statement about the human capacity to adapt.
 (So, in fairness, is the speed with which hackers figured out ways to crash Zoom meetings and cause other forms of chaos. Zoom now has new security functions to keep bombers out).
 Zoom and other video conferencing aids are crucial right now. We are social animals, and it’s good for health to maintain networks of family, friends, neighbours or co-workers.
 Robyn Mogil, co-owner of the Entertainment Communications agency, TARO PR, was ahead of the curve with Zoom use and organized an important family function with the app early on. She’s since watched Zoom use evolve.
 “It’s a strong sign of human adaptability. At first you saw news media broadcasting from their basement.”
 It was a bit amateurish initially, says Mogil, but things got more sophisticated quickly.
 “Now my agency is creating branded virtual backdrops for Zoom conference calls, and organizing virtual premieres and interviews with celebrities. It’s evolving and we are moving very quickly as a company to adapt.
 “The arts and entertainment are important when we are being encouraged to stay at home.”
 Mogil’s statement about the importance of the arts points to another rapid adaptation: All the wonderful galleries and museums (such as the AGO and the ROM) you can browse online while stuck at home. Many have educational kids programs running, too.

HOUMA, La. (AP) " Houma native Trevon Gauno knows the odds may be stacked against him in regard to hearing his name called during the NFL draft on April 23-25.


  Gauno took the junior college route after graduating from Terrebonne High School in 2015.


  As a defensive back, he attended six different colleges in recent years, including Shasta College in California, Cisco College in Texas, Independence Community College in Kansas and Dodge City Community College in Kansas, Angelo State University in Texas and William Penn University in Iowa.


  The 23-year-old Gauno has traveled a long road to continue his playing days in college, but he refuses to let anything disrupt his dreams of becoming a professional football player.


  'If you really believe it, then you could do it,' Gauno said. 'I won't let anybody tell me that I can't do something. If I want it, I'm going to go get it.'


  With the NFL draft coming up soon, Gauno said he believes his hard work and dedication has helped put him in a position to either get drafted or sign with a team as an undrafted free agent this year.


  'It's a blessing. I give all the credit to God,' Gauno said. 'Without Him, none of this would be possible. I'm just enjoying the process. I worked for it. Not too many people have this opportunity, so I just want to enjoy it because I know I've put the work in no matter what. Whatever happens, happens. I'm just going to keep going.'


  The NFL draft process is usually intense pressure for small school prospects like Gauno, but he refuses to let it get the best of him. Gauno said he doesn't care if his name gets called during the draft. He wants to a team to give him a chance to show what he can do.


  'I haven't even been worrying about it. I've just been putting the work in,' Gauno said. 'All I need is an opportunity. How I get it or when I get it doesn't matter to me. I don't care about my name getting called. That's just hype. All I care about getting that chance whether it is by getting drafted or signing as a free agent. If you give me a chance, I'm going to take advantage of it.'


  The recent coronavirus has affected the draft process for most hopefuls like Gauno, especially since it has shut down gyms in recent weeks and canceled college pro days.


  But Gauno (5-foot-10, 180 pounds) held his own pro day in Houma on April 4 and posted many eye-opening numbers, including a 4.4 second 40-yard dash time, a 34-inch vertical leap, a 10.1 broad jump and 1.26 10-yard split time that ranks among the best with top draft eligible cornerbacks.


  Gauno said he believes his pro day numbers should help get him on the radar of many NFL teams. He has received interest from the Green Bay Packers, Tampa Bay Buccaneers and New York Giants.


  He and his agent " Giles Cole of Max Q Sports and Entertainment " will send his pro day times and videos to all NFL and Canadian Football League teams.


  'This is what I did all my journey for,' Gauno said. 'It comes down to if you really want it. My hard work paid off.'


  Gauno has spent most of his time training with Joel Ross, who runs the Prime Time Fitness Gym at the Southland Mall in Houma.


  Ross, a former Vandebilt Catholic and Southern Miss star defensive lineman, helped Gauno prepare for his pro day.


  'It was really good to see him have success on that day and actually be proud of the numbers that he put up,' Ross said. 'He has worked hard to get those numbers. It was crazy that he was able to put those type of numbers up in the middle of a pandemic.'


  Local NFL analyst Mike Detillier has Gauno listed as a priority free agent signee this year.


  'Guys like Trevon get hurt in not being able to go to a team and work out for them, so it's word of mouth and a scout's opinion of him,' Detillier said. 'Trevon can play. There's no question in my mind. He's mentally and physically tough. He is fast. He can flip his hips and get back into coverage well and he has excellent recovery speed. He's not intimated by anyone out on the field, and he's got good ball skills.'


  Detillier said Gauno needs to make it to an NFL training camp to prove himself.


  'The first thing he needs to do is make an impact on special teams,' Detillier said. 'He needs to show the league you are committed to play special teams and that is your first foot in the door. Yes, LSU is DBU, but Louisiana is DBU state. There is some real top defensive backs in this state. I'm proud of Gauno for hanging in there and chasing his dream. He's talented, confident, fast and he's a worker. That's what I am looking for in a late round pick or free agent and someone focused.'


  Gauno said he has no problems with working his way up in the pro football business. After all, he has overcome many obstacles to get where he is today.


  In high school, he struggled with his grades and that cost him a chance at a Division I scholarship, and he stopped attending class at one point when he was a sophomore.


  But he was able to turn it around before it was too late. He finished his senior year at Terrebonne with second-team All-District 7-5A honors in 2015.


  After being underrated in high school and college, Gauno said he has managed to put himself on a radar for NFL teams.


  'I'm used to starting from the bottom. That's my comfort zone,' Gauno said. 'I think if I was put at the top and was given a lot of stuff, I think I would lose more, but since I usually start from the bottom, that's my comfortable zone and I'm going to succeed every time.'


  After watching him train, Ross said he believes Gauno has all the mental and physical tools to make it into the NFL.


  'I think it would be very special given the path that he took and the things he had to go through. It would be like a Cinderella story,' Ross said. 'Considering the odds he has been through, if he would get his name called, that would be amazing. I'm not going to say it's impossible, but that would be the icing on the cake of his Cinderella story.'


  Gauno said he has picked up a lot of knowledge after playing at various colleges. He had 23 tackles and four interceptions at William Penn last season, playing in only five games after transferring. He has defended taller receivers and made plays all of the field, so he is confident in his ability and skills.


  'I've been to five different schools. I've been coached by over 20 coaches. I've played every single coverage. I know how to do everything,' Gauno said. 'Most people only know how to play one coverage in four years. When you look at my film, you'll see that I'm making plays that D-I guys made. No matter what level you do that on, that's an NFL play. Not too many people can do that.'


  Gauno said his six-month-old daughter " Legaci Arreis Roman Gauno " has given him more inspiration to make it into the NFL.


  'It's my biggest motivation seeing my daughter growing up,' Gauno said. 'She depends on me. I want to give my family a better opportunity. My job is to keep working. I just wake up with a smile on my face every day and just work and be satisfied with whatever God gives to me.'


  As long as he keeps working, Ross said Gauno has a bright future ahead of him.

Barber accepts that playing in front of full crowds would be the preferable option, but believes clubs will adapt in these unprecedented times.

  “It would be strange, and football but not quite as we know it, but if that is the only way then of course we have to get on with it.”

New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said the state appears to be past the “plateau” on the coronavirus infection curve and is "starting to descend”, as hospitalizations continue to decline and the daily death toll dropped under 550 for the first time in almost two weeks. "Hospitalization numbers are down (and that is) good news,” Cuomo said at his daily coronavirus press briefing on Saturday, noting that the number of people getting hospitalized from the virus continues to fall from around 18,000 to currently 16,000, the emergency rooms have fewer people in them and the ICU admissions and intubations continue to be down.


  "If you look at the past three days, you could argue that we are past the plateau when we're starting to descend, which would be very good news. Again, it's only three days but that's what the numbers would start to suggest,” he said, while cautioning that even if the state is not at a plateau anymore, “we're still not in good position.” He said the state continues to witness the “tragic” news of daily deaths. An additional 540 people died on April 17, which is “not as high as it was” but still suggests that the health crisis is far from over. New York State had reported 606 deaths on April 15, which was the lowest figure then in 10 days.


  Of the 540 deaths, 504 people had passed away at hospitals and 36 in nursing homes, which Cuomo said are the “single biggest fear in all of this” because of all the vulnerable people in one place. “It is the feeding frenzy for this virus despite everything we can do in the best efforts of people who are working in those nursing homes and are doing a fantastic job.” New York City, the epicenter of coronavirus outbreak in the US, has 122,148 confirmed virus cases and more than 7,890 COVID-19 deaths and another 4,309 probable deaths, people who did not have a positive COVID-19 laboratory test, but their death certificate lists as the cause of death "COVID-19" or an equivalent..

Lucknow The state government on Saturday claimed that the spread of the coronavirus in Uttar Pradesh was under control.Additional chief secretary, home, Awanish Kumar Awasthi said Uttar Pradesh was the country's most populous state with a high population density. Yet, in comparison to other states, the Covid-19 cases and the number of deaths were less in UP, he said.Several districts, including Pilibhit, Maharajganj, Hathras, Prayagraj, Bareilly and Shahjahanpur had got rid of the corona tag after the infected patients in these districts recovered and there were no fresh cases there, he said. The central government had lauded the efforts of the Uttar Pradesh government and directed other states to follow the UP model to control the spread of coronavirus in their respective states, he said. "If we analyse in terms of population, UP would have been the fifth most populous country had it been a separate nation. In comparison to the national average, there were less coronavirus positive cases in UP," he said. The state government was able to control the spread of the coronavirus due to the joint efforts of various government department employees, who were working round the clock in coordination with sanitisation workers, police personnel and frontline health workers, he said.The state government had identified the hotspots and divided them in three categories to control the spread of the virus, he added. The first category included 179 hotspots in 15 districts, the second had 93 hotspots in 25 districts and the third category included seven hotspots in five districts, he said.The health department and police teams surveyed 11 lakh people in category one hotspots, 12.88 lakh people in category two hotspots and 20,000 people in category three hotspots, he said.UP'S COVID TALLY 869A state government officer said 869 positive cases were reported in 49 districts till Saturday.

Coronavirus in Oklahoma: Stitt sees light at the end of the tunnel


--DocBreak--
The league has been suspended since March 13 because of the pandemic, which has caused a near-total shutdown of sport across the globe and strict limits placed on people’s movement in an attempt to curb the virus's spread.


  Even if some of the UK government’s lockdown measures are eased, a ban on mass gatherings is expected to remain in place for several months. That would mean any return to Premier League action would likely take place behind closed doors, with the games broadcast on live TV.


  Playing without a crowd would negate much of the home team’s advantage as they would no longer have the vociferous backing of their own fans. There is also the issue of what clubs would do with the swathes of empty seats usually occupied by supporters.


  Brighton chief executive Paul Barber says such issues have been discussed, including the possible use of fake crowd noise and covering seats with messages thanking NHS workers for their efforts throughout this crisis.


  “We’ve started to give some thought internally into, ‘Could we dress the stadium?’” Barber told _The Times._


  “Could we make the stadium better than just blue empty seats in our case? Could we look at noise being brought into the stadium in some way, but is that really what the fans at home would want and is that what the broadcasters would want?


  “I would rather see the blue seats covered. We could put up a great message to thank the NHS of course and we can use the space we have got for good purposes, without a doubt.


  “Then you’ve got the operational challenges: how would it work in terms of the emergency services? The last thing we would want is to put any more pressure on them.”


  Playing matches playing behind closed doors is viewed as the fairest way of deciding key issues such as relegation and European qualification, compared to other proposed solutions such as using a points-per-game average or even voiding the season altogether.

As the boat reached the Malaysian coast, it was turned back by the country's authorities, Islam said. The overcrowded trawler then traveled to Myanmar and tried to enter twice but was denied entry by the Myanmar navy, according to Islam.
 The Malaysian coast guard has not yet responded to CNN's request for comment on Friday.
 CNN also reached out on Friday to Myanmar's Foreign Ministry and its embassy in Dhaka, Bangladesh's capital, but has not received a response.
 Bangladesh authorities found the trawler in the country's territorial waters late Wednesday -- after spending 58 days adrift at sea -- off the coast of the southern district of Cox's Bazar.
 The spokesman said the rescued refugees, most of whom were starving and dehydrated, had been handed to the United Nations Refugee Agency to be quarantined for 14 days due to coronavirus concerns.
