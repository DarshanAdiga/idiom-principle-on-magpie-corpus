He didn't have to teach the coaches — the coaches just hit the ground running and already knew what was expected of them. So the players go, ‘Man, all these guys believe this, they can teach it, they’re all tied in.' With that, there was a confidence that was built in. Even when things start off slow, the guys are going, ‘We’re this close to turning things around again to the way we want it.' And they just keep at it.”

There have been various rumours about Arsenal signing defenders this January, and it looked very like the one about the Shakhtar Donetsk defender Mykola Matviyenko was the most likely, but with that one being a loan to buy, perhaps we could still get both of them this month.
 Mari looks very interesting and was actually a Man City player for a while, but was sent on loan to Girona, NAC and Deportivo La Coruna and didn’t actually play for City. So he has much experience of playing in Europe having started his career with Mallorca, and may be happier being closer to his family in Spain.
 He was very highly-rated in the Club World Cup Final against Liverpool and I am sure that if Edu rates him highly then he can be a real asset to the Gunners.
 Maybe this transfer window could turn out to be better than we expected yet!
 Here is short video of some of Mari’s defensive skills in 2019. Looks good!

Certain foods that you eat for breakfast can either make or break your day. To get your body running with high energy levels throughout the day depends on how you start your morning. So, the right combination of protein, fibre and healthy fats is required to make your breakfast a power- packed meal.Foods such as berries, oatmeal, spinach, egg omelette, and Greek yogurt should be included in your breakfast. But, instead, most people opt for bagels, pastries, buttery cakes, etc. These foods can make you feel sluggish, increase the risk of chronic diseases and you can end up gaining weight.Here is a list of foods that you should avoid eating in the morning.Foods You Should Avoid Eating In The Morning Many breakfast cereal brands have written on packages that they contain whole grains. But, in reality, these cereals are highly processed and contain a small number of whole grains and mostly refined grains and added sugars 1. This increases the risk of many chronic diseases, including obesity. You might think that getting a sandwich from a food joint is healthy and a filling option for breakfast. But, you could be wrong as many of these packed sandwiches are high in refined carbs and low in fibre. This can lead to a spike in blood sugar, increase bad cholesterol and make you gain weight 2. The store-bought packet oatmeal does make your mornings easy, but, actually, they are just boxed cereals in disguise. Flavoured oatmeals are the worst foods to eat in the morning because they are highly loaded with sugar and low in fibre.According to a study, people who consumed oatmeal increased fullness and reduced hunger as compared to those consumed oat-based ready-to- eat breakfast cereal 3. Muffins have the reputation for being healthy, but its not because it is made with vegetable oils, sugar and refined flour. They also contain added sugars or filled with dry fruits and chocolate chips. Pancakes and waffles are surely popular choices for breakfast, but they are the worst foods to eat in the morning. It is because they are very high in refined flour and are topped with pancake syrup, which contains high fructose corn syrup 4. Pastries, croissants and doughnuts are worst foods to eat in the morning for breakfast because they lack in fibre and protein and are also loaded with excess calories, sugar and unhealthy fats 5. Are you in the habit of grabbing a fruit juice or smoothie from your favourite food outlet? If yes, then stop doing it as they have added sugars. Some of these smoothies contain full-fat milk, ice and cream and is more like a milkshake rather than a smoothie 6. Opt for home-made fruit smoothies made with Greek yogurt. Granola bars sound like the best breakfast option, isnt it? But, they are often no better than candy bars and they contain a lot of added sugar. Granola bars contain a combination of sugar, honey and corn syrup. This can raise your insulin levels, inflammation and blood sugar. Flavoured yogurt is an unhealthy breakfast food. It contains no healthy fats and is packed with sugar as compared to Greek yogurt. Eliminating the fat from yogurt will deplete your body from the essential nutrient. Scones are usually topped with jam or cream and most people have it for breakfast. But not many know that it is an unhealthy breakfast option because its high in calories, and refined carbs and low in fibre and protein.

I wonder if it's down to the West Wales upbringing, the community spirit, the togetherness and respect you have for other people. As I say, maybe I'm a bit biased because I'm from this neck of the woods as well. Look, before you East Walians have a go at me, you're a pretty decent lot too, mind! Good people everywhere in Wales.
 I just feel there's something about his West Wales background that makes Stephen the way he is. That doesn't, let me emphasise, make you a better person, nor more Welsh. But there is a humbleness to Stephen and you notice that whenever you speak to him, or see him conduct interviews on television.
 He never has a bad word for anybody, only sees the good in people.
 Our paths have crossed quite a bit down the years. I used to referee Stephen in youth rugby, then, of course, when he was playing for Llanelli, and the Scarlets.
 Our paths followed when he went to Clermont and I did one of their games in Europe. I even reffed Stephen at Wasps, who he joined as player-coach, when I did one of their matches against London Welsh in what was then the Aviva Premiership.
 We've kind of stayed in touch. He's such a deep thinker on the game and at the referee's camps I sometimes hold with Wales he'll be ready to ask questions on definitions of the law. 'If we do this, is it legal?' That sort of thing. I also get phone calls quite often. 'What about this type of play, was that try legal?'

The question of American casualties took on added importance at the time of the Iranian strike because the degree of damage was seen as influencing a U.S. decision on whether to counterattack and risk a broader war with Iran. Trump chose not to retaliate, and the Iranians then indicated their strike was sufficient for the time being. Tensions have since eased.
