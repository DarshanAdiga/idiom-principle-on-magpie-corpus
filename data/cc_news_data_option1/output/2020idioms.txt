Flowers abounded in every nook and cranny, animals of all kinds, particularly birds, moved through the property looking for what she had left for them. Her home was migratory stop for many, her kindness always the draw. Her cellar was packed to the gills with canned goods, and on many a day there were pies and cookies, and fresh baked bread, cooling on the counter.

 I am responding to a letter on May 19 in which D. Michael Watkins of Jacksonville tells us to quit hiding in our homes. He goes on to give a list of deaths that happen every day and year. And compares these deaths to COVID-19. Difference is smoking is not contagious, neither is opioid abuse, heart disease and neither is the woman who sneezes into her own mask. But in case you don't realize it, COVID-19 is highly contagious. Oh, and by the way, car accidents aren't contagious either. I don't care if you wear a mask, I don't care if you catch COVID-19. I am tired of caring about people who don't care about anybody but themselves. I am also tired of hearing about your First Amendment rights like if the people that disagree with you have no rights. If your rights infringe upon my rights then you should think twice about all people having rights, not just you.

When I checked in with some of the former writers and producers on the late, great Freaks and Geeks for a recent “FF/RWD” feature, I asked creator Paul Feig if it was at all possible that the gang could get together for new episodes, as the _Arrested Development_ folks did on Netflix.
 Feig said it was unlikely. First off, the cast members have gone from kids to adults and moved well beyond high school. Second, Feig does not want to mess up the legacy of a show he is mighty proud of. “I’m afraid of anything that would sully the memories of what we did,” he says. “You’d have to go in very soberly and make the stories as good or better than before.”
 For what it’s worth, he didn’t officially rule out the idea. “Who knows?” Feig adds. “You never say never.”
 Here’s a fun one to debate over beers–has a show ever spawned as many huge careers, not only the performers (James Franco, Seth Rogen, Linda Cardellini, Busy Philipps), but the folks in the writers’ room, including Feig, Judd Apatow, Mike White, Gabe Sachs, Jeff Judah, Jake Kasdan and several other big TV writers, producers and directors?
 As I said in the story, Feig asked his writing prospects for projects that were their own ideas–plays, screenplays–as opposed to the standard spec scrips, which he says were pretty much all _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_ at the time. Feig says he got a sense early on in the show’s development that he had a special bunch. “I thought, wow–these are funny and talented and real writers,” he says.
 Adds writer J. Elvis Weinstein: “It was a really good writers’ room, a room filled with very funny people. It was a bunch of people who were really into making a special show.”

Tourism Ireland has said the market here can expect an 80% drop in business this year.
 But its boss, Niall Gibbons, said the €4bn to €5bn the Irish public would have spent overseas presents an "opportunity" to the sector here.
 He said there is no clear return to free movement across Europe at a time when the high season would normally begin.

"That was a big breakthrough moment where I sort of got to my 'rock bottom'. From there on I've got better and better with the help of my family and my friends and I started speaking to a sports psychologist which I still do now regularly to just keep on top of it."

"Every day we are either planning the next episode or shooting it. And there's also a podcast I do (with JP Duminy), so come to think of it, I don't think I've had a day so far in this period where I have not had anything to do. That's my life now," she had said.
