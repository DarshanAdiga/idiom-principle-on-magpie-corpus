The U.S. economy is losing steam as COVID-19 cases continue to spread across the country and Congress delays passing another coronavirus relief package to help millions of American workers and small business owners weather the storm. That is raising concerns about a potential contraction in economic growth early next year, which would mark the first "double dip" recession in the U.S. since the early 1980s.

Right now, Frank Martin feels like he's sitting on an airplane waiting to land at an airport.
 The Gamecocks' 2020 season screeched to a temporary halt Tuesday night when the program announced it was taking a pause because of positive COVID tests within the program.
 The announcement first of all canceled South Carolina's home opener Thursday against Wofford and put the Gamecocks in a state of limbo with just five non- conference games left.
 “We’re just circling right now. We all got tested again today. We all will get tested again tomorrow. Some of those results will confirm or determine the future," Martin said on his call-in show. "The one thing that is in stone is we could not practice today and cannot play a game tomorrow and more than likely won't be able to practice Friday."
 The earliest the Gamecocks could reconvene is Friday, but it appears that's a little out of the question, depending on what Thursday's test results come back as.
 If the Gamecocks shut things down for an extended time—potentially two weeks—it could mean having to cancel quite a few games, including the annual rivalry game against Clemson.
 Over the next 14 days South Carolina is scheduled to play three games outside of the Wofford game: Dec. 14 at George Washington, Dec. 19 against Clemson and Dec. 23 against South Carolina State.
 A lot of the potential to play these games will depend heavily on the test results coming up this week, but right now the Gamecocks are in the dark.
 "Moving forward we got no idea when next day where we can convene and start practice," Martin said. "We’re still too raw to have a drop dead date of when we’re doing this.”
 The Gamecocks have started the season 1-2 with a win over Tulsa and losses to Liberty and Houston.

Normally, Mike McGill would be neck-deep in planning an all-star extravaganza Christmas show.
 COVID-19 has wrecked those plans, however, and while the show will go on, the “Mike McGill Christmas Spectacular” will look a little different this holiday season.
 McGill is a familiar face around these parts, having played in the Drunk Uncles (with Jeff Barbra and Gordy Gilbertson) several years ago, as well as the Cathouse Prophets (with Smoky Mountain Harley-Davidson and Shed Juke Joint owner Scott Maddux). He’s also the co-founder of the hardcore honky-tonk outfit the Barstool Romeos, regular fixtures at The Shed, and since 2012, he’s organized the “Spectacular” as a holiday performance designed to share the stage with musically minded friends while raising money for Second Harvest Food Bank of East Tennessee (based in Maryville).
 This year, he told The Daily Times recently, the show was going to be turbo- charged, moving from Barley’s Knoxville in the Old City to the historic Bijou Theatre, which seats roughly 800 people.
 But then COVID-19 struck.
 “I’m going to have to simplify things a little bit,” McGill said. “I just try to remember that I’m a singer more than a musician, and I’ve just go to pick and move, man. So we’re going to keep the date — Dec. 18, and we’re just going to livestream it. Basically, you’ll just go to my (Facebook) page, click on the video, and there will be a link that goes straight to Second Harvest, so you can make a donation.
 “And then there will be a link that goes straight to the Bijou as well. All proceeds will go to those two, and I wanted to add the Bijou this year, because trying to work this thing out with them has been tough on us all, and I’ve gotten faith and good friendship with some of the individuals over there.”
 In years past, the “Spectacular” has worked like this: McGill and a band of close friends provides the music, and guest vocalists and instrumentalists get up one after the other to perform holiday songs — everything from the sacred to the secular, from classic to contemporary, from reverent to profane. It’s up to his selected guest to choose their tunes; McGill and his players take care of the rest, and the event usually draws hundreds of fans of the local scene for a Christmas gathering that feels more like a family reunion than a show. (More than 400 guests paid to attend last year, and McGill estimates he’s raised thousands of dollars for Second Harvest over the years.)
 However, after contemplating whether to do a limited attendance livestream from the Bijou stage, he and Bijou organizers ultimately decided to pull the plug. Rising COVID-19 numbers make the venture too risky, so instead, McGill will get on a stage in a downtown warehouse by his lonesome, armed with a guitar and a selection of his favorite tunes, on Dec. 18.
 “When Black Friday hits every year, I just start listening to every Christmas song I can come up with, every playlist and obscure recommendation, to try to find something in there that fits me,” he said. “Two I’ve done every year, and I plan on doing them forever, are Chuck Berry’s ‘Run Run Rudolph’ and Merle Haggard’s ‘If We Make It Through December.’ And how fitting is that for this year?”
 Running sound will be “Big” Al Braden, the longtime soundman from Barley’s Knoxville and a familiar face to audiophiles in the scene. Steve Corrigan, a drummer for a half-dozen local bands, will run the video. Other than the three of them, the warehouse will be empty, McGill said. The lack of guests and fans, he said, was perhaps the most difficult thing to come to terms with.
 “The thing that makes the ‘Spectacular’ spectacular is not just the willingness and the openness of people to give of their talent and their time — but it’s also a hell of a lot of fun!” he said. “I tell these people that they shouldn’t have anything else going on in their minds when they step up there to perform. And if they’re not having so much fun they can’t stand it, then I don’t want them to feel uncomfortable at all.
 “So I had to check myself a little bit get back into reality. I’m still just one guy trying to do this, and because everything’s going to be different this year with everything, I don’t really have to measure up to years past. There won’t be any audience feedback, so I’m not going to get any instant gratification out of it, and I won’t be able to hear the audience laughing through cyberspace, so I don’t know if my jokes will land or not. That’ll be a little challenging.”
 But while McGill certainly has fun organizing the shindig and taking part in it, it’s become something greater over the years than one man’s desire to throw a big holiday party for his pals. It started out that way, he acknowledged, but the more he’s been able to lend a hand to Second Harvest, the more meaningful these annual shows have become. And that’s why, despite the ruination of COVID-19, he couldn’t let 2020 elapse without playing Christmas music in some form or fashion.
 “Whenever I’ve needed help, people have been there and helped me when I didn’t know where or when it would come from, or who or what would provide it?” he said, his voice choked with emotion. “Why would I not want to be able to do the same thing in return? Whether I know, meet, touch or see any of these people ever, why would I not want to?
 “This started out as a selfish act of wanting to be around everybody for the holidays, but it has grown and gotten completely bigger than me. So we’re going to carry it on one way or another, because we’ve got to do something for the greater good — whether it’s feeding kids or bringing smiles to people’s faces in a dark time.”

People could be chopping the paws of cats and dogs for black magic, a veterinarian in the southeastern province of Diyarbakır has suggested after such recent incidents.      Vet Nurhan Kahraman’s comments came after news of the paws of a cat, named “Melek” (Angel in Turkish), having been chopped off. The cat died despite medical efforts to bring her back to life.      “When the cat was brought to me, its two legs were amputated. It was not due to an accident. The skin of the legs was studiously removed. It was done on purpose,” said Kahraman, stressing that the cut paws were not found.      “Someone who did this took the legs. So, this reminds us of one thing that could be the cause of the attack: Sorcery,” she added.      She also stressed that lately a puppy named “Pamuk” (Cotton in Turkish) was attacked in the Black Sea province of Samsun and its two legs were chopped.      Tuba Göklü, a health technician working for the veterinarian, said she has witnessed such attacks on animals for sorcery in her past experience working with pets.      “When I was working in [western province of] İzmir, we met someone who called himself a psychic. He said he was able to read minds with blood he used to remove from pigeons,” she said.      Göklü stressed that what she saw was “ferocity and ignorance.”      “Unfortunately, we could not save Melek. With this situation, I have once more witnessed another sorcery-inspired attack. Superstitious beliefs show us how the public stays uneducated,” she added.      On Dec. 5, a doctor found the cat in her apartment basement shouting in pain and brought the cat directly to Kahraman. The veterinarian made the first aid and named the cat ‘Melek.’ However, the cat could only live for a day as it had lost a lot of blood.

 Fisher had been coaching with the West Windsor-Plainsboro High South boys’ soccer team for the last 21 years. He had been the program’s head coach for the last 11 seasons, accumulating a 91-84-13 record, which included three Mercer County Tournament Final appearances in four years (2015, 2017, 2018) and five consecutive double-digit win campaigns from 2015-19.
 The Pirates, who did not play in 2020 after WW-P schools elected to go without fall sports because of coronavirus concerns, have not yet made known Fisher’s replacement.
 “Coach Fisher is well known and highly regarded in the local soccer community. He brings a wealth of knowledge and coaching experience to our program,” Roche said in a press release. “(With him) having played and coached in Mercer County for many years, I believe he will hit the ground running, and our program will not miss a beat.”
 Fisher is no stranger to Notre Dame. He has coached the Irish’s varsity girls’ lacrosse team for eight seasons, leading them to multiple Colonial Valley Conference, MCT and NJSIAA Sectional Championships.

 Dr. Sharma said Canadians should feel comfortable getting the shot, which was “authorized only after a thorough assessment of the evidence demonstrated that it met Canada’s strict standards for safety, efficacy and quality.”
 Canada is set to receive up to 249,000 doses this month and officials expect to start to administer 30,000 doses next week after an initial batch is shipped from Belgium on Friday.
 Britain began vaccinations Tuesday.
 U.S. regulators on Tuesday also released their first scientific evaluation of Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine and confirmed it offers strong protection. Vaccines are emerging from an all-out worldwide race and are reaching the market less than a year after the virus was even identified - a remarkable scientific achievement that shaved years off the usual process.
 The encouraging developments come as the coronavirus continues surging across much of the world. The scourge has claimed more than 1.5 million lives, including over 285,000 in the U.S., the highest toll of any country. U.S. Food and Drug Administration scientists are meeting on Thursday, when the agency’s independent advisers will debate if the evidence is strong enough to recommend vaccinating millions of Americans.
 "It is encouraging to see that our mRNA vaccine is now authorised in Canada. Following U.K. and Bahrain, it is the third country to approve use of our vaccine within a week,” said Sean Marett, BioNTech’s chief business and chief commercial officer.
 U.S. FDA scientists reanalysed data and found the Pfizer vaccine appears safe and more than 90% effective across patients of different ages, races and underlying health conditions.
 Britain’s medical regulator warned Wednesday that people with a history of serious allergic reactions for the time being shouldn’t receive vaccine from Pfizer and BioNTech. Sharma said Health Canada is only advising people with allergies to the ingredients in the vaccine to avoid it, but said the agency will will review information out of the U.K. and decide whether to expand that advice.
 "The people that had the allergic reaction in the U.K. had histories of severe allergic reactions,” she said. “At this point in time we are not changing our recommendation.”
 Canada recently amended the contract with Pfizer so that it would deliver up to 249,000 doses this month. That will mean about 124,500 of the highest risk Canadians will get vaccinated at first as two doses are required per person a few weeks apart.
 Pfizer and BioNTech said it will supply a minimum of 20 million doses to Canada through 2021 and as many as 76 million.
 Canada has contracts with six other vaccine makers and is currently reviewing three other vaccines, including one by Moderna that Canadian health officials said could be approved soon.
 Howard Njoo, Canada’s deputy chief public health officer, said officials plan to get initial shipments of the new vaccine to 14 sites across the country by next week.
 "We have a reason to feel optimistic and excited about returning to the lives we had pre-COVID,” Dr. Njoo said.
 "We anticipate having approved vaccines for 3 million Canadians between January and March with supply ramping up the rest of 2021.”
 The government has said 14 distribution centers will be located in large Canadian cities initially. There will be at least one in each province and two each in Canada’s four largest provinces.
 "This is phenomenal news for all Canadians as we take the next step toward ending this pandemic. As soon as vaccines arrive on Ontario soil, we will be ready to deliver and administer them,” Ontario Premier Doug Ford said in a tweet.

 After a virtual UN meeting with the African Union, Mr. Guterres said at a news conference that financing COVAX is the only way to guarantee vaccines will be available in Africa and other developing areas.
 WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a high-level UN General Assembly meeting last week on COVID-19 that the light at the end of the tunnel is growing steadily brighter to end the pandemic. But, he added, vaccines must be shared equally as global public goods, not as private commodities that widen inequalities and become yet another reason some people are left behind.
 Mr. Tedros said WHO’s cash-strapped ACT-Accelerator programme to quickly develop and distribute vaccines fairly, which includes the COVAX project, is in danger of becoming no more than a noble gesture without major new funding.
 COVAX will require an additional $23.9 billion for 2021, he said, stressing that the $28 billion total is less than one-half of 1 per cent of the $11 trillion in stimulus packages announced so far by the Group of 20, the world’s richest countries.
 The United Kingdom and Russia have already started vaccinating people against the coronavirus. In the United States, the Pfizer vaccine could get a green light for emergency use in the coming days and the Moderna vaccine in the coming weeks. Canada announced approval of the Pfizer vaccine on Wednesday.
 Guterres said Africa’s 54 nations have registered more than 2.2 million cases of coronavirus infections and over 53,000 deaths from COVID-19.
 There is real hope that vaccines — in combination with other public health measures — will help to overcome the pandemic, he said.
 But to end it, he added, vaccines must be available to all and most African countries lack the financing to adequately respond to the crisis, due in part to declining demand and prices of their commodity exports.
 The director of the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, John Nkengasong, said in late November that vaccinations against the coronavirus on the continent might not start until the second quarter of next year. “I have seen how Africa is neglected when drugs are available in the past,” he told reporters.
 Mr. Guterres said Wednesday when asked about Mr. Nkengasong’s assessment: “It is my hope that we’ll be able to do it before the second quarter, but it is true that what we’re seeing today is an enormous effort by several countries in order to ensure vaccines for their own populations. It’s true we are seeing vaccination nationalism moving at full speed,” the UN chief said.
 If Africa is not properly supported, we will not be able to fight the pandemic, he said. There are several vaccines in the pipeline for COVAX, and it is perfectly possible to deliver if the financing is guaranteed.

During its use as a cotton gin, the main building served as the place where seed was separated from cotton. The seed was then transferred to the seed house via pipes. The octagonal seed house was divided into eight sections for seed storage.
 The Satterwhites began restoring the seed house in 2018, but had to divert their attention to another project the following year. However, they didn’t have to start completely from scratch when they returned. A previous owner installed the current ceiling and windows in order to stay there.
 “It was a good shell to work with,” Tommy said.
 He and Anne had to install flooring, doors and lighting, and give the ceiling and walls a fresh coat of paint.
 Doors that had been stored at the main building found new life in the seed house while maintaining the building’s rustic character. Tommy restored a cabinet, which now holds the kitchen sink.
 The sink is placed against a wall in the kitchen which the Satterwhites left unpainted to highlight the seed house’s original wood. They also left an original ladder which extends to the top of the seed house.
 Touches like these blend the past with the present, as will a collection of paintings and sketches of barns which the Satterwhites will display on a wall near the door.
 Tommy and Anne are debating whether to add televisions. With The Old Cotton Gin’s peaceful setting and its close proximity to downtown Warrenton, they are thinking about maintaining the seed house as a full getaway from the busyness and technology of modern life.
 The Satterwhites have not rented the two bedroom, one full bath seed house yet, but are allowing a few people to stay there in order to provide feedback. They hope to be able to rent the building after the first of the year.
 As they move closer to opening the Airbnb, Tommy and Anne hope to hear from people who have memories of coming to the cotton gin with their parents or grandparents. To inquire about renting the seed house or to share a memory, visit The Old Cotton Gin’s Facebook page.

For the second consecutive week, the Seattle Seahawks will play host to a team from New York.
 They're looking for a much different result when the Jets (0-12) come to town Sunday.
 The Seahawks (8-4) suffered a 17-12 loss last weekend to the New York Giants, who were starting backup quarterback Colt McCoy. That dropped Seattle into a first-place tie with the Los Angeles Rams in the NFC West.
 "We've shown some vulnerability at 8-4 that we can let some games get away from us," Seahawks coach Pete Carroll said. "We really have high expectations to play well every time out and find a way to win. It certainly can happen. You got to get everything done, every week."
 Russell Wilson has gone from midseason MVP favorite to MIA.
 In the first five games of the season, all victories, Wilson had a 129.8 passer rating with 19 touchdown passes and three interceptions. Over the past seven games, in which the Seahawks are 3-4, he has a 93.5 passer rating with 13 touchdowns and eight picks.
 Wilson completed 27 of 43 attempts against the Giants with a touchdown, an interception and a lost fumble. He was sacked five times, with four of those for eight yards or more, and took 10 hits.
 After scoring 27 or more points in each of their first eight games, the Seahawks have reached that mark just once since. And they've failed to amass 350 yards of total offense in each of their past four games.
 "Early in the year it was wide open, it was like the Wild West out there on offense," Carroll said. "We fell prey to that as well. But it's tightening down."

BATON ROUGE, La. — LSU freshman tight end Arik Gilbert, who entered this week leading all active Tigers in receiving, has decided to opt out for the remainder of the season.
 LSU coach Ed Orgeron announced Gilbert's decision on Wednesday and the coach could not say for certain whether Gilbert intended to return next season or transfer elsewhere.
 “Do I think we have a chance at getting him back next season? Yeah,” Orgeron said. “Is there a chance of him transferring? I don’t know that. He hasn’t told me he’s transferring, but obviously we’re going to re-recruit him and obviously we wish him the best."
 LSU (3-5) announced Wednesday it will self-impose a bowl ban in light of NCAA rules violations.
 Orgeron said the 6-foot-5, 249-pound Gilbert told him he was opting out because "his body was hurting and he had some things he had to take care of.”
 Under NCAA rules adopted during the coronavirus pandemic, players may opt out this season without adversely affecting their scholarships.
 Gilbert had 35 catches for 368 yards and two touchdowns. He had been second in receiving at LSU behind Terrace Marshall Jr. until Marshall decided to opt out before last weekend's 55-17 loss to Alabama.
 Gilbert is from Marietta, Georgia, and was the Gatorade Male Athlete of the Year for 2019-20 — a distinction that made him arguably the highest-profile member of LSU's previous recruiting class.
 Now he's the ninth LSU player to opt out in 2020, following receivers Marshall and Ja'Marr Chase; cornerback Kary Vincent; defensive ends TK McLendon and Travez Moore; and defensive tackles Siaki “Apu” Ika, Tyler Shelvin and Nelson Jenkins.
 LSU (3-5), which has gone from winning a national title last season to being one loss away from having its first losing season since 1999, has two regular season games remaining. The Tigers travel to No. 6 Florida this Saturday and close the season at home Dec. 19 against Mississippi.

“I think it more stems on whether they feel it’s appropriate or whether they think it may hurt a song and I don’t know who makes that decision, maybe it’s someone within YouTube that might have to flag something- if there was a sensor that went up and someone used the song in the wrong way, like a major hit, then there may be some kind of approval rights that are behind the scenes that we don’t see. Different songs with different artists have different agreements with the labels. It’s more or less with the publisher. Some of them have approval rights over how their songs are used, so that could be part of it, too.”

 "It's also about the socialization and the clubs and the athletics and music programs and art programs," said Northampton Area School District Superintendent Joseph Kovalchik.
 Staff have been trying to keep kids' school life and academics as normal as possible while also keeping students' health and safety in mind.
 With COVID-19 cases rising, both Bethlehem Area School District and Northampton Area School District announced Wednesday they will go completely remote starting Monday and through the start of the new year. But, Richards says educators will continue to think outside the box to reach students through a computer screen.
 "I don't think teachers want credit, they don't want me touting all that they are doing, they want the kids to succeed. Ultimately that would be their pat on the back if we could turn some of these failures around," Richards said.

The endangered Caretta caretta sea turtles are at the risk of experiencing cold shock due to hypothermia with the onset of winters as the air cools down, said Professor Yakup Kaska, the head of the Sea Turtles Research, Rescue and Rehabilitation Center (DEKAMER), adding that there is no problem in the Mediterranean and Aegean seas at present.      Kaska said that because of Caretta caretta sea turtles’ slow metabolism, treatments requiring medication take time during the winter period, and it can even take longer in case if the turtles swallow fishing lines or experience head trauma.      He also said that many turtles, which do not migrate in mass, face the danger of hypothermia due to the sudden temperature decrease in the open seas.      Hypothermia can lead to decreased heart rate and circulation, thus the loss of eating and swimming abilities, and finally leading to freezing and death, Kaska said, adding that about 40 sea turtles were rescued from hypothermia off the coast of Massachusetts recently.      These turtles were taken to Florida by plane for treatment by a volunteer organization called Turtles Can Fly Too, he stated.      Explaining that the condition of hypothermia can occur with sea temperatures dropping considerably, Kaska stated such a case was not seen in the Mediterranean and Aegean seas though there could be a possibility in the Black, Marmara, and other northern seas.      Stating that the blood circulation of the turtles slows down alarmingly when the air and seawater are extremely cold, making it difficult for the nutrients and oxygen in the blood to reach the cells, Kaska said: “They become weak and wash ashore. Although this is not very common in our country, they can be spotted quite frequently in the ocean coasts, Atlantic and other northern regions.”      Stating that hundreds of sea turtles can wash ashore from the ocean in the north of Florida, the professor said that treatments are given to save the sea turtles, which include slowly increasing their body temperature along with serum supplements.      Noting that such a sea turtle once washed ashore in Turkey many years ago in the northwestern province of Balıkesir, he said, “Our seawater temperatures create suitable environments for the reproduction and life of turtles.”

The 1970s life of Jean and Eddie (Rachel Brosnahan and Bill Heck), in some Pittsburgh suburb, seems routine, kind of humdrum. She makes him breakfast every morning, he heads off to work, she stays home and putters around. No kids, just the two of them. He comes home. Same thing next day. They're content.      Then everything changes. One day Eddie brings an infant home, and says to Jean, "He's our baby. It's all worked out."      Stunned for a moment, she asks, "Where did you ..." But Eddie cuts her off with a terse, "Not now, Jean." And that's the end of that conversation. The tiny boy will be called Harry, and he'll be a world-class crier. And life goes on.      Then everything changes again. Eddie goes off to work, this time with three pals, one of whom returns alone that night, gun drawn, asks Jean if she's OK, gives her a large pile of money, hustles her and Harry out of the house. He puts them under the protective care of Cal (Arinze Kene), a stranger who identifies himself as an acquaintance of Eddie, and doesn't say much else, but proves to be both a gentleman and a sort of baby whisperer when it comes to criers.      Watching all of this happen so rapidly, you want to call out, the same way poor, confused, frightened Jean does, "Please tell me what's happening!"      In the short time it takes for Cal to explain that he can't explain, and that people are looking for Eddie "and for you, too," which is why he's bringing them to a hideout, "I'm Your Woman" quickly becomes a road movie, until it becomes a gangster movie and a thriller and a mystery. Cal, Jean, and Harry are on the run, from some unnamed bad guys as well as from the cops.      There's so much going on in this film, so much of it unclear - to Jean, apparently to Cal, and to anyone watching - I feel justified to divulge the slightest of spoilers: Eddie's a criminal, and Jean knows it and puts up with it. But it looks like he's gone too far this time!      So, the trio on the run gets to a well stocked safe house, Cal leaves, after instructing Jean to stay inside and not answer the door. Harry's crying reaches new heights and, of course, there's soon a knock on the door.      Things keep happening, then nothing happens, then there's a feeling that something is going to happen. Then, in this oddly paced film, lots more happens.      Men with guns show up, demanding to know where Eddie is. But remember, Jean and Eddie have a protector in Cal, and even though he left them at the house, he's still accountable for their safety.      Well into the film's two-hour running time, some answers to some questions start popping up, most of them about the pasts of Jean and Eddie. Cal doesn't reveal much personal information, but you feel that he's trustworthy, even likable. With the introduction of some additional characters - Teri (Marsha Stephanie Blake) and Art (Frankie Faison) are the important ones - the film becomes even more complicated, but in an engrossing way.      Though everything bad that's happening is eventually traced back to Eddie's errant behavior, the story is really more about Jean, and how she copes with it all. It's too bad that something's missing in Rachel Brosnahan's ("The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel") performance. Maybe it was her choice, maybe it was director Julia Hart's, but she seems to be holding back, not letting us understand what's going on in Jean's head. You have to strain a little to root for her. She's in a bad way but she doesn't earn enough of our sympathy to really care about her.      Near the end, somebody pushes the "send many plots in different directions at once" button and the film has characters pouring out their most inner secrets while trying to survive amongst shooting, running, and general chaos.      It all comes to a somewhat happy but abrupt ending, which doesn't feel very convincing. Still, there's a compelling, if somewhat slow, intense, and involving story played out before that ending.

Last summer we completed a trial using a GE blade, and we were very happy with the results. This fall we have processed more than 100 blades so far, and our customers have been very pleased with the product.

"The coach had a great influence in my decision to join this team and even though we had some bad results I know we are building something good together.
 "I have had the bad luck to suffer an injury but I hope I can play again soon and fight for this team."
 Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang fired another blank in the defeat to Tottenham, making it four games without a goal for a low-scoring Arsenal.
 He has just two goals from 20 shots in the Premier League this term, nine of those finding the target, but Arteta is confident his skipper will soon regain his best form.
 "Nobody is un-droppable. At the end of the day, we have to find the right players to win football matches," he said.
 "But we cannot forget what Auba has done for this club and what he has done in recent months, not years ago.
 "I see how he's training and how he's behaving, how much he wants to turn this situation around.
 "When I see that type of hunger, it's about supporting the player as well as the status he has in the team because of the performances he has provided for this football club."
 Arsenal have already made certain of top spot in Group B ahead of their match with Dundalk in Dublin, boasting a perfect record after five matches.
 Another victory at the Aviva Stadium would make it six consecutive wins in European competition, excluding qualifiers, for the first time since November 2005.
 Arteta is expected to heavily rotate his side for the final group outing, with Dundalk bottom and yet to pick up a point.
 "We have a few kids here," the Spaniard said when asked about his team selection. "We left a few players at home as well.
 "There are a lot of games and we need a complete training week as well, which I think is going to benefit us. But we're going to have a very competitive team to play."
 The Gunners' European form is in stark contrast to their domestic woes, their return of 13 points from 11 league games their fewest since 1981-1982 (12 points).
 "The demands for this football club are the highest," he said. "We are not getting the results in the league that we all expect, of course the pressure is increasing.
 "But more than the pressure, I would say the responsibility of all of us to make it happen next Sunday and start winning football matches, which is the most important thing."

Apparently, Santa Claus, who like Jesus’ father knows everything about everyone, derided Kennedy’s presentation — make that misrepresentation.
 The letter, signed as if it were from Santa Claus, read, "Please remove your negro Santa Claus yard decoration. You should try not to deceive children into believing that I am negro. I am a caucasian (white man, to you) and have been for the past 600 years. Your being jealous of my race is no excuse for your dishonesty. Besides that, you are making yourself the laughing stock of the neighborhood. Obviously, your values are not that of the Lakewood area and maybe you should move to a neighborhood out east with the rest of your racist kind.”
 Kennedy, 33, and African American, said he had hoped that his lawn display cultivated pride in his five-year-old daughter. The faux Santa note prompted this Kennedy response.
 “I am trying to be as nice as I can in this very moment because I am actually filled with rage,” Kennedy said in a Facebook live stream offering.
 Hold off on the rage, my brother. Racism intends to push people to the brink, disable us emotionally, leaving us entangled and recalcitrant until we either explode or implode.
 “Our thing is about representation for our daughter, seeing herself in everything and knowing that she can do whatever she wants to do and she’s not going to be limited by her color," Kennedy told Good Morning America.
 "The Black Santa is something I wanted my daughter growing up seeing. She doesn’t even question seeing a white Santa Claus, because we’ve always told her that’s what he looks like in other people’s houses," Kennedy added. "For other people, Santa is a representation of them."
 A similar situation exists with Jesus who suffers a westernization that makes him more Caucasian, sometimes with blue eyes. Christianity in America would suffer fallout if Jesus received a darker complexion and less European features.

Canada’s health regulator approved Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine on Wednesday, days ahead of possible approval in the United States, and said it hopes to start giving the shots next week.
 The vaccine made by U.S. drugmaker Pfizer and Germany’s BioNTech vaccine already has been authorszed for use by the United Kingdom and Bahrain, and officials have said they expect the U.S. authorizstion within days.
 "This a momentous occasion,” said Supriya Sharma, chief medical adviser at Health Canada. “The geek in me is amazed. No one would have thought, even when we looked back at the first discovery of the virus, that less than a year later we would be authorizing and distributing a vaccine.”
 Dr. Sharma said Canadians should feel comfortable getting the shot, which was “authorized only after a thorough assessment of the evidence demonstrated that it met Canada’s strict standards for safety, efficacy and quality.”
 Canada is set to receive up to 249,000 doses this month and officials expect to start to administer 30,000 doses next week after an initial batch is shipped from Belgium on Friday.
 Britain began vaccinations Tuesday.
 U.S. regulators on Tuesday also released their first scientific evaluation of Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine and confirmed it offers strong protection. Vaccines are emerging from an all-out worldwide race and are reaching the market less than a year after the virus was even identified - a remarkable scientific achievement that shaved years off the usual process.
 The encouraging developments come as the coronavirus continues surging across much of the world. The scourge has claimed more than 1.5 million lives, including over 285,000 in the U.S., the highest toll of any country. U.S. Food and Drug Administration scientists are meeting on Thursday, when the agency’s independent advisers will debate if the evidence is strong enough to recommend vaccinating millions of Americans.
 "It is encouraging to see that our mRNA vaccine is now authorised in Canada. Following U.K. and Bahrain, it is the third country to approve use of our vaccine within a week,” said Sean Marett, BioNTech’s chief business and chief commercial officer.
 U.S. FDA scientists reanalysed data and found the Pfizer vaccine appears safe and more than 90% effective across patients of different ages, races and underlying health conditions.
 Britain’s medical regulator warned Wednesday that people with a history of serious allergic reactions for the time being shouldn’t receive vaccine from Pfizer and BioNTech. Sharma said Health Canada is only advising people with allergies to the ingredients in the vaccine to avoid it, but said the agency will will review information out of the U.K. and decide whether to expand that advice.
 "The people that had the allergic reaction in the U.K. had histories of severe allergic reactions,” she said. “At this point in time we are not changing our recommendation.”
 Canada recently amended the contract with Pfizer so that it would deliver up to 249,000 doses this month. That will mean about 124,500 of the highest risk Canadians will get vaccinated at first as two doses are required per person a few weeks apart.
 Pfizer and BioNTech said it will supply a minimum of 20 million doses to Canada through 2021 and as many as 76 million.
 Canada has contracts with six other vaccine makers and is currently reviewing three other vaccines, including one by Moderna that Canadian health officials said could be approved soon.
 Howard Njoo, Canada’s deputy chief public health officer, said officials plan to get initial shipments of the new vaccine to 14 sites across the country by next week.
 "We have a reason to feel optimistic and excited about returning to the lives we had pre-COVID,” Dr. Njoo said.
 "We anticipate having approved vaccines for 3 million Canadians between January and March with supply ramping up the rest of 2021.”
 The government has said 14 distribution centers will be located in large Canadian cities initially. There will be at least one in each province and two each in Canada’s four largest provinces.
 "This is phenomenal news for all Canadians as we take the next step toward ending this pandemic. As soon as vaccines arrive on Ontario soil, we will be ready to deliver and administer them,” Ontario Premier Doug Ford said in a tweet.
