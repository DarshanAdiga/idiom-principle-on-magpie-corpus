When Peter Andre married Katie Price in 2005 he vowed to be the dad that Harvey didn't have.


  While the marriage only lasted four years, Peter has continued to share messages of support for Harvey including this week when he wished the teenager a happy 18th birthday.


  However, there has been a time when Peter slipped out of his life, with Katie bemoaning that all the male role models in Harvey's life turning their backs on him.


  After Peter met Katie in the Australian jungle when they appeared on I'm A Celebrity together in 2004, there was a whirlwind romance which led them up the aisle less than a year later.


  There seemed to be an unbreakable bond between Peter and his stepson and there was even talk that Peter would adopt Harvey, as his real father, footballer Dwight Yorke, had not accepted him from the beginning.
