Kelechi Nwakali made his first start in La Liga this weekend, and Arsenal will be watching his progress closely.
 The Gunners have a buy-back clause in the contract of the Huesca midfielder, having allowed him to join the Spanish Segunda side in the summer of 2019.
 Nwakali confirmed the clause in an interview with ScoreNigeria previously, when admitting that it was still his ‘dream’ to return to Arsenal.
 He said: “Arsenal have been my dream team, but one thing is sure, is not late yet, the aim is to just go there and get more playing time because there is a buy-back option in the contract.”
 The 22 year-old clearly still hopes that he can earn a return to the Emirates, having had his previous spell with the club tarnished by a failure to obtain a work permit having arrived at the club with huge potential.
 Nwakali was part of the Nigeria Under-17 World Cup winning side of 2015, where he picked up the Golden Ball Award, but was unable to obtain a work permit, and ended up leaving the club on loan for a number of seasons.
 Arsenal eventually sold to Huesca, where he was still not allowed to play, but he finally retrieved a permit to play and made his debut in June of this year.
 After promotion to La Liga this term, Nwakali could well make a name for himself, and Arsenal will no doubt be following his progression with a view to bringing him back should he begin to meet the potential he previously showed.

Blumenthal Performing Arts’ venues are home to premier Broadway touring attractions as well as the Charlotte Symphony, Community School of the Arts, North Carolina Dance Theatre, On Q Productions, Opera Carolina, Queen City Theatre Company, and The Light Factory Contemporary Museum of Photography and Film.
 As the cultural hub of the greater Charlotte area, there are high expectations for every type of event that takes place here. The organization relies on its sizeable contingent of wireless microphone systems from Rio Rancho, NM-based Lectrosonics.
 Robert Schoneman serves as one of Blumenthal Performing Arts’ Production Managers. With an emphasis on the production and presentation of touring Broadway attractions, live music, and theater, Shoneman’s responsibilities include day-to-day production management in the Belk Theater and, occasionally, at the Booth Playhouse as well as helping ensure consistency across sound systems and control equipment in all of the organization’s venues. Tasked with ensuring trouble-free performance from all the audio equipment used, Schoneman discussed the factors that led to his selection of Lectrosonics’ Digital Hybrid Wireless technology.
 "Our top concern for our wireless microphone equipment was sound quality-- primarily noise floor and a lack of HF artifacts caused by analog companding," Schoneman said, "and that’s where Lectrosonics equipment really delivers. Since the wireless gear is frequently used in a theater directly adjacent to a touring Broadway production, it was essential the equipment be able to operate capably in a crowded RF environment and that the ability to scan for and select open frequencies be quick and easy. We’ve also been very impressed with the rugged build quality of the Lectrosonics beltpack transmitters. When you consider how this type of equipment gets handled during costume changes and so forth, it’s a very important consideration."
 The Lectrosonics arsenal Schoneman selected includes twelve LMa beltpack transmitters that are used with Countryman B3 Omni Round Lavaliere microphones. On the receiving end, the system includes two Lectrosonics VRMWB Venue series receiver mainframes, each fully stocked with six Lectrosonics VRT receiver modules. This 12-channel system is augmented by two Lectrosonics SNA600 dipole antennas plus the company’s VRpanel software (part of LecNet2) for remote monitoring of the system.
 "We purchased the Lectrosonics equipment to be used for two annual productions," said Schoneman. "The Blumey Awards, which takes place in the Belk Theater is to recognize and reward excellence in high school musical theater and is a feeder program to the national Jimmy Awards in NYC. Charlotte Squawks takes place in in the Booth Playhouse. This show is a locally produced revue of local/regional/national events and politics. The show is best described as 'Broadway meets Saturday Night Live meets Charlotte.’ All the actors wore their transmitters in NeoPax mic belts beneath their undergarments. Since everyone changes costumes for almost every number, we’re not doing any crazy transmitter placements, but it’s very reassuring to not have to worry about the equipment’s reliability and performance."

“My putting, I just turned it on, especially on the back nine,” Snedaker said. “I felt really comfortable hitting good shots into the greens when needed and making some putts.”
 His teammates followed suit. The Rams shot 291, which was Saturday’s lowest team round by six strokes, to move from fourth into a tie for state runner-up honors with Winter Park. Both teams totaled 601 for 36 holes.
 Tallahassee Chiles defended its championship by repeating its first round 297 for a 594 total. Windermere was seventh with 620.
 “We closed really well,” Lake Mary coach Louis Suarez said. “We had a tough first round, but we stayed focused today. That’s the key here at Mission Inn. It’s a mind game and you need to keep that focus for four-and-a-half hours. If you lose it, you’re done.”
 Winter Park was tied with Chiles after Friday’s 18 holes but started slowly in round two.
 “We struggled on the front nine today,” Winter Park coach Rob Robison said. “We closed a bit on the back, but it wasn’t enough. I’m proud of how my guys fought and showed a lot of grit.”
 Winter Park’s Andrew Clark finished fourth overall at 144, one shot ahead of teammate Michael Mays and Oviedo’s Joshua Stewart.
 On Mission Inn’s Las Colinas course, the Lake Nona girls improved their first round score by 24 strokes, shooting 308 to place fifth with a 640 score. Sarasota Riverview carded a 589 total to cruise to the title. Windermere’s girls matched their boys seventh place finish.

 The defense also forced a takeaway for the seventh consecutive game when linebacker Eriq Gilyard ripped the ball out of the hands of a Houston receiver when the Cougars were deep in UCF territory.
 Grant added an interception in the fourth quarter, his third of the season and the 10th of his career.
 Houston scored its first offensive points of the game midway through the third quarter when running back Kyle Porter dove into the end zone to cut the lead to 23-13. The Cougars came up short on a two-point conversion.

I definitely read for it, though, but it was bizarre."\nThe lyricist explained that he believes he didn't get the part because they didn't get to experience his charm in person. \"It was during COVID and the reading was over the phone. It was just a weird situation. I'm better in person, I have to charm you. You've actually got to see the whole me. It's not good to just get a snippet of me over the phone, you know? You have to really take in the Baklava experience." Maybe he'll get a spot on the soundtrack.

SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) — Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham on Saturday said the spread of coronavirus is out of control in New Mexico as she urged residents to stay home and avoid gathering with others to celebrate Halloween. “Please — do your part to protect yourself and your fellow New Mexicans by celebrating a COVID-SAFE Halloween,\" the Democratic governor's office said in a Facebook post. “Stay home. Do not gather with others.\" State officials on Saturday reported 592 additional known virus cases and 11 additional deaths but said the case data for the day was incomplete due to a technical problem. “Due to a technical disruption of the electronic laboratory reporting system, the following data reflects only a partial total for today’s case update,” state officials said in a statement. “The delayed results will be included in the state’s reporting as soon as they are received and confirmed.” The additional cases and deaths reported Saturday increased the state’s totals to 46,490 cases and 1,018 deaths. The state reported over 1,000 additional cases on Friday when it also reported a single-day record of 13 deaths and when the state's death toll exceeded 1,000. Lujan Grisham on Friday ordered flags to fly at half-staff starting Monday for a week of mourning. She called the toll “an unfathomable tragedy,” saying the drumbeat of a few more deaths every day should not diminish the acute feeling of loss. State health officials also renewed their pleas that people adhere to the public health order, which calls for residents to stay home whenever possible, limit contact with others and wear face coverings, among other things. Coronavirus related hospitalizations reached 354 on Saturday, the ninth consecutive day the state has set a record for that metric. . ..

SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) — Clashes continued Saturday between Republican election challengers and absentee-ballot counting board in a southern New Mexico county at the center of a congressional swing district race. State Republican Party Chairman Steve Pearce said that another GOP challenger was ejected Saturday from a Dona Ana County vote counting facility as the person tried to get close enough to the ballot tallying machine to take a photograph of numbers on the machine. Four challengers were ejected Friday. Challengers are appointed by political parties in New Mexico to be present as county election boards verify and tally ballots and can dispute the veracity of ballots for a variety of reasons. Pearce says the GOP has instructed its challengers in Dona Ana County to take photographs of serial numbers and daily vote tallies on the machines to ensure an accurate count. “How else can we make sure nothing happens in the middle of the night?” he said. The state's director of elections sought assurances Friday from the Republican Party that its poll challengers are not being told to disobey election board members, after four challengers were ejected Friday in an altercation with Dona Ana County's absentee ballot counting board. Agency spokesman Alex Curtas said Saturday that the concerns had not been addressed yet by the party. The letter from Elections Director Mandy Vigil described reports from Dona Ana County officials that a Republican election challenger grabbed an election board member, and that vote counting was interrupted. Pearce says surveillance video was submitted to state elections regulators and shows that the altercation was not physical, and that the party is not instructing challengers to disregard election officials. The video was not immediately...

_Furthermore, lawful permanent residents, once admitted, are granted "open- market" employment authorization documents, allowing them immediate eligibility to compete for almost any job, in any sector of the economy. There is no way to protect already disadvantaged and unemployed Americans from the threat of competition for scarce jobs from new lawful permanent residents by directing those new residents to particular economic sectors with a demonstrated need not met by the existing labor supply. Existing immigrant visa processing protections are inadequate for recovery from the COVID-19 outbreak. The vast majority of immigrant visa categories do not require employers to account for displacement of United States workers. While some employment-based visas contain a labor certification requirement, because visa issuance happens substantially after the certification is completed, the labor certification process cannot adequately capture the status of the labor market today. Moreover, introducing additional permanent residents when our healthcare resources are limited puts strain on the finite limits of our healthcare system at a time when we need to prioritize Americans and the existing immigrant population. In light of the above, I have determined that the entry, during the next 60 days, of certain aliens as immigrants would be detrimental to the interests of the United States._

JONESBORO, Ark. (KAIT) - On Saturday, the MOPS Jonesboro group held a Playdate at the Park event to celebrate Halloween safely.This year, several parents have questioned if they will let their child participate in trick-or-treating because of the pandemic. The MOPS Jonesboro group came up with an alternative option.The group met at Miracle League Park in Jonesboro. Kids dressed in their Halloween costumes played on playground equipment and received candy bags.Samantha Nail, MOPS coordinator, says that events like these are important because it allows kids to have fun and brings moms together.“We know what trick-or-treating has kinda been up in the air this year," said Nail. We wanted our moms and our kids to have still the chance to do something fun, outside, socially distanced but still able to wear those costumes, play together, and a way for moms to still have that community.”Nail says that the pandemic has taken a toll on mental health. Moms and kids coming together can help combat that.“We just know that it’s important for mama, both mental health and all of those sorts of things, to still be able to interact with others as much as possible," said Nail. "And the same thing with kids, just to be able to get outside and get sunshine, to run around and run off the energy, it’s great for everybody.”To find out more information on future Playdate events or how to participate in the MOPS Jonesboro group, follow their Facebook page.Copyright 2020 KAIT.

Despite the fact that no institution will be spared, says Baker, the pandemic will affect different institutions in disproportionate ways. "For some colleges, this is an existential threat that means they'll have to close," she says, while others will have the financial backing to weather the storm. What keeps her up at night? Those institutions that serve more vulnerable populations and are in more remote or rural places. Because, she says, they have the potential to feel the financial pain even more. There, students rely on colleges for services such as health care, campus jobs, child care and free food. Baker says those places, which have already been largely underfunded, will be hard-pressed to stay afloat.
