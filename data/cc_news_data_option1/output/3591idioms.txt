Immediately I introduced myself, he recalled and said “Sola Oni of The Nigerian Stock Exchange”. He was quite happy to see me, offered me his complimentary card and asked about my welfare. He was impressed that apart from being a financial journalist and Public Relations Consultant, I have become a Chartered Stockbroker. He said I should get in touch. Ever since, I began to have close access to him. Olusegun Osunkeye is a household name in Nigeria, yet he is not a noise maker. He believes that your work must speak for you. During my first visit to him in his serene corporate office at Ikeja, GRA, where his staff work round the clock, he served me tea and insisted that I was his visitor. He noticed that I was not comfortable with this approach and quickly educated me that it was not at variance with African way of treating a visitor, irrespective of age disparity. While we were drinking tea, I told him to let me write his biography. He smiled and said more than 10 people had made such a request but he turned down all. “Most of the biographies published and launched in Nigeria are dumped somewhere after the launching. Many Nigerians don’t cultivate reading habit. I really don’t see the need for that. It doesn’t affect my contributions to knowledge”. He showed me a copy of biography of one of the late Nigerian business moguls which was just delivered to him and asked rhetorically: how many Nigerians have patience to read this book? We discussed on granting interviews occasionally on national issues. “Sola, I don’t need any form of publicity. I enjoy my private life and I don’t want to discuss my family,” he said in a measured tone. He speaks with professional and intellectual candour on any subject. Ironically, the fearless Osunkeye, an unwilling newsmaker is a delight to every crack reporter. His appearance at any function often causes stir and automatically elevates the standard of the event. Despite his deliberate avoidance of publicity, Osunkeye cannot be ignored at any forum. He is generous and has an insatiable desire to uplift the downtrodden. He once told me how he joyfully paid an artisan N1000 for a service of N100. “I love to make people like him happy. The money meant a lot to him and his family. He was happy. He did not expect such. I pay every professional for the service rendered, no matter how close we are. I don’t overstretch my goodwill and I don’t believe in all these charity”, he told me and we both laughed.
