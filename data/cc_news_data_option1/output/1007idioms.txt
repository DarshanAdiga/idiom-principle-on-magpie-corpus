U.S. officials have boasted of shipping well over 1 million tests to labs across the country. But it’s unclear how many have actually been used on patients, because tests have gone out to private labs and hospitals that don’t report into the CDC, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar told reporters earlier this week.
 Azar said the government is working to setup a data system to combine government testing figures with those of large companies like Quest Diagnostics.
 Government officials have pledged that these private testing companies would drastically expand U.S. capacity. But a Quest spokeswoman on Wednesday said it could take up to six weeks to ramp up to testing tens of thousands of samples per week.
 On Feb. 14, the CDC’s Dr. Nancy Messonnier said the agency was “in the coming weeks” going to use labs in five cities to provide a good look at whether coronavirus might be appearing. The idea: When patients tested negative for flu, their specimens would go through coronavirus testing to see if the new bug was what had been causing their flu-like symptoms.
 “Results from this surveillance would be an early warning signal, to trigger a change in our response strategy” if cases started appearing, she said. CDC officials subsequently said the number would be expanded beyond five.
 But nearly four weeks later, doctors and scientists are still awaiting news that the surveillance system is up and running. This week, health officials in Hawaii said they planned to begin randomly testing negative flu samples in that state for the new coronavirus.
 CDC officials have for weeks declined to detail why the system has been delayed, leaving experts mystified.
 Dr. Jeffrey Engel is executive director of an organization of disease investigators, the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists.

If you ever wanted to cause the property market to collapse, a good way to go about it would be to restrict owners' rights through a raft of draconian rules. But surely no-one would do that, right? Wrong. Under the Palaszczuk Government's rental reforms, there won't be a right to refuse pets, renters will be able to perform their own modifications and owners will need a valid reason to end a tenancy.

That included the Canucks, who are in Phoenix for a game scheduled tonight with the Coyotes. The Canucks had entered that game in ninth place in the heated Western Conference playoff race.
 Remember the playoff race? Remember earlier in the week, when the big North American leagues all announced a new set of guidelines for interacting with the media to combat the coronavirus? Now, the idea of standing six feet away from your interview subject seems almost quaint.
 Just like that, the coronavirus did what the Second World War couldn't, what 9/11 couldn't, what any number of crises couldn't. It shut down our games.
 "We will continue to monitor all the appropriate medical advice," the NHL said in its official statement on Thursday morning. "And we will encourage our players and other members of the NHL community to take all reasonable precautions -- including self-quarantine, where appropriate. Our goal is to resume play as soon as it is appropriate and prudent, so that we will be able to complete the season and award the Stanley Cup."
 The NHL, in fact, tried to strike a reassuring tone with its release and its rights holders were on board with the messaging. The term pause was used repeatedly. A short timeline was suggested. But who are we kidding here.
 Think of where this story was at the start of the week. Now think of where it is today. Consider also the uncertainty over the impact of the virus on the United States. We are in the early days here and, while the medical community can offer educated guesses, that's all they are. As unsettling as the current situation has become, it's bound to change again and again and again.
 It will change by the time you read this column. It will change again tomorrow. That's the only thing we know for sure about what lies ahead. The future has become a great unknown. That's not being alarmist.
 That's being realistic.
 And yet, there still seems to be some sense of denial from the stewards of our games. While the NHL announced its desire to return as, "soon as its appropriate and prudent," there was a report stating the NBA will be out of action for 30 days at the minimum.
 The PGA tour, meanwhile, has one of its flag ship, the Players Championship, running in northern Florida this week. The first round was held on Thursday in front of fans. It will be closed to fans beginning on Friday but the tournament will play out on Sunday, as will all PGA events through the Texas Open in three weeks. That decision prompted this response from veteran Lee Westwood.
 "Considering the approach of other sports in the U.S. to the coronavirus, I'm surprised how little the PGA tour are doing,"
 The Canucks, for their part, are expected to issue a statement shortly but said not to expect much more from the club.

NWSL announces TV deal with CBS
 CHICAGO (AP) — The National Women’s Soccer League has agreed to a multiyear broadcast deal with CBS that will put both the season opener and the championship game on network television.
 Fourteen additional games will be broadcast on CBS Sports Network and 71 will be available on the CBS All Access streaming service. Twenty-four matches also will be streamed on Twitch.
 “We are excited to work with CBS with its rich history, tradition and storied innovation to utilize the power of their multiple platforms to reach more fans. We also are eager to team up with Twitch to showcase the brightest stars in the sport,” NWSL Commissioner Lisa Baird said in a statement. “These partnerships will continue to amplify the NWSL and its teams on a national and international stage.”
 The deal gives the league a stable broadcast partner. After the U.S. women’s national team won the World Cup in France last summer, ESPN broadcast a number of games on its channels. Before that, the league had a partnership with A+E Networks that included a game of the week aired on the Lifetime channel.

Four Swiss nationals who had been stuck on the Grand Princess cruise ship outside San Francisco have returned to Switzerland.
 The foreign ministry tweeted on Thursday that the US government had arranged for the four Swiss, plus three Germans, to fly to Kiev in Ukraine. From there, a flight organised by the Swiss government had brought the seven to Switzerland.
 None was reported to have been infected by Covid-19.
 On March 7 the foreign ministry had announced that there were four Swiss citizens aboard the liner that was barred from docking in San Francisco owing to the coronavirus.
 Samples had been taken from 46 people and 21 of them – 19 crew and two passengers – tested positive for the coronavirus, said US Vice-President Mike Pence, who is running the White House’s response to the outbreak.
 One of the Swiss on board, a 55-year-old man, told Swiss newspaper Blickexternal link that everyone had to stay in their cabins. “It’s like a ghost ship. It’s spooky!” he said.
 A 71-year-old man who had been on a previous cruise died from Covid-19 on his return to California.

Things will get worse from here. According to a survey of epidemiologists released yesterday, the coronavirus outbreak probably won’t peak before May. That doesn’t mean it will be over by May, of course, but that it will be getting worse and worse and worse over the next two months, and for much of that time, presumably, exponentially worse. And so the suspension of the NBA season and Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson’s announcement that they are sick with COVID-19 will seem, in relatively short order, like quite small potatoes. And for all of that time, the country’s response will be commanded and controlled by Donald Trump.

The contest for Rajya Sabha (RS) seats is heating up between Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi allies Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and Congress. Today is the last day to file nominations. The biennial RS elections will be held on March 26. Of the 55 seats in the RS going to polls later this month, seven are from Maharashtra. The confirmed candidates from the state are NCP chief Sharad Pawar, Union minister Ramdas Athawale, former Member of Parliament (MP) Rajiv Satav of Congress, former MP Udayanraje Bhonsle and former mayor of Aurangabad Bhagwat Karad of Bharatiya Janata Party.
 While Pawar had filed his nomination on Wednesday, Athawale and Bhonsle did so on Thursday. BJP's Karad and Congress's Satav, whose names were declared on Thursday, will file their nominations today. Shiv Sena will field Priyanka Chaturvedi, reported news agency PTI.
 The seven RS members from the state will be elected by the 288 legislators in the lower house of the legislature. To get an RS seat, a candidate requires 37 votes. BJP has 105 MLAs of its own and the support of another nine. To send four members to the RS, the support of 148 MLAs is needed. While Congress, NCP and Shiv Sena collectively have 170 members, the decision of who will get the fourth seat has led to a tussle between NCP and Congress.
 NCP has 54 members in the Assembly and want to field two candidates -- Pawar and Majeed Memon -- who are retiring on April 2. With 44 MLAs, Congress wants to contest for the fourth seat.
 "We have a long list of senior leaders who need to be rehabilitated. Hence, we are demanding the fourth seat. Mukul Wasnik (former Union minister), Hussain Dalwai (RS member, retiring next month) and Rajni Patil (former RS member) are a few contenders from the party," said a Congress leader requesting anonymity.
 A senior NCP leader said the decision on the fourth seat has already been made. "It has been decided that the seat will remain with NCP and Fauzia Khan will be filing her nomination," said the leader requesting anonymity.
 Insiders said Chaturvedi's nomination had the approval of Sena scion Aaditya Thackeray. Senior Sena leader Diwakar Raote, who is a member of the legislative council in Maharashtra, was hopeful of getting the ticket but the party was not keen, said sources in the Shiv Sena.

Within hours of Weinstein’s sentencing, prosecutors in Los Angeles announced they were beginning the extradition process to bring him there for an arraignment on charges he raped a woman and sexually assaulted another in 2013.
 Los Angeles authorities might decide to pick him up at Rikers Island before he can be processed for a New York state prison assignment, but his hospitalization makes the timing even more uncertain.
 “We don’t know what’s happening,” Aidala said. “With Harvey, all bets are off.”
 In addition to the heart issues, Weinstein’s lawyers have said, he has been dealing with the ramifications of unsuccessful back surgery stemming from a car crash last summer and a condition that requires shots in his eyes so he does not go blind.

The U.S. lag in coronavirus testing is “a failing,” a top federal health official said Thursday, and public health experts say they still don’t have a good understanding of how widely the new virus has spread.
 The effort initially was hobbled by delays in getting testing kits out to public health labs, but the stumbles have continued, leading scientists to conclude that the virus has already spread far wider than government officials are reporting.
 U.S. health officials, for example, promised nearly a month ago to tap into a national network of labs that monitor for flu. That system still isn’t up and running.
 On Thursday, Dr. Anthony Fauci of the National Institutes of Health agreed that the U.S. needs to improve how it’s testing.
