Both armies had British-produced Enfield or American-produced Springfield rifle-bored muzzle-loading muskets (although it was not until 1863 that the Confederacy could claim to have comprehensively rid itself of old smoothbores and, in fact, at the start of the war even the Union relied heavily on smoothbores as rifled muskets tended to be the preserve of regular soldiers). The South had a preponderance of Enfields (it bought three hundred thousand from Britain) because its relatively weak manufacturing capacity made it more reliant on imports. The caliber was a little smaller than that of the Springfield, and the gun was a little lighter, but to all intents and purposes the weapons were pretty evenly matched.

"Either you can make a movie for $2 million or for $100 million. It’s the worst business model of all time."

 "I spoke with the staff on the sidelines, but we didn't really have a major hesitation about getting him against Southampton, and he played well and scored and then there was no hesitation in playing him in the next game against Bournemouth.

EDMONTON - The Alberta budget is counting on oil and gas bouncing back while recognizing it's time to put more money and effort into areas such as high- tech and tourism.
 But with a bottom line still deep in the red, Premier Jason Kenney's government continues to hold the line on program spending while pursuing job, benefit and salary cuts from thousands of public sector workers.
 "We recognize that our unemployment rate remains stubbornly high in this province," Finance Minister Travis Toews told a news conference Thursday before introducing the 2020-21 budget in the legislature.
 "While we've had a jobs focus from Day 1 as a government, we will be putting an even finer focus on job creation going forward."
 The budget projects a deficit of $6.8 billion on revenues of $50 billion. Debt is expected to rise to almost $77 billion by spring 2021 and to almost $88 billion by 2023.

But his thought had been instantaneously general; and the officers, with one voice, ordered the charge; and cries of “Forward, forward!” raised us … and changed the complexion of our feelings. The pulse of action beat feverishly once more; and, though overhead was crowded with peril, we were unable to give it so much attention as when we lay stretched on the ground._
