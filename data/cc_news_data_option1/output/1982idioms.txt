Many beaches have created cordoned off sunbathing 'squares' for tourists with one region going even further by introducing designated zones for different ages and family groups.
 The number of sunbathers on Spain's best beaches could be reduced by as much as 90 per cent.
 Proposals for Silgar beach in the northwest of Spain show five roped-off sections each with 780 spaces measuring 9sqm.
 Each space will have a 1.5m gap between each one to ensure social distancing.
 You'll have to stay in your square while on the beach and if you want to go for a walk and play games you will need to move to a different designated strip.
 You'll also have to use another marked out strip if you need to use the toilet or other facilities.
 To go for a dip in the sea you will need to follow a six-metre wide special passageway.
 You won't be allowed to reserve your spot.
 Lloret de Mar on the Costa Brava, is going one step further by dividing its beaches into three different age segments in a bid to stop the spread of coronavirus.

Death reminders first trigger immediate, front-line defenses - you want to feel safe by getting death out of your mind right away. Then subconscious downstream defenses work to fortify the protective bubble of the symbolic reality you believe in. Researchers have found that these downstream defenses include more punitive reactions to criminals, increased rewards for heroes, prejudice toward other religions and countries and allegiance to charismatic politicians.

Apparently magnetic eyelashes are a "thing."      I realized this when I started getting a suspicious number of Facebook ads for magnetic false eyelashes. I thought that maybe it was just me and Facebook had determined somehow that I was eyelash-challenged and in desperate need of a solution. But then I found out that my friends were also getting the same ads, so it seemed we were a nation of eyelash-deficient women who could only be saved from this crisis by fake magnetic eyelashes.      In the ads, women applied a magnetic eyeliner on their eyelids which created a magnetic field that attracted a pair of polar opposite eyelashes. This is actually more science than anyone who buys their makeup out of a sale bin at the drugstore needs to know. Supposedly, though, this is a much easier system for applying eyelashes than the old "glue-on and hope you don't glue your eyelids shut" method. I tried the old glue-on method once and the eyelashes came unglued, fell on my cheek, and then someone slapped me because it looked like I had a hairy caterpillar on my face.      After a while, the eyelash ads began to taper off. But then, suddenly, I started getting ads for a fortifying eyelash serum so I could grow out my own pathetic eyelashes and not have the need for magnetic ones. Not wanting to put anything potentially dangerous near my eyes (um, like magnets) I found out that the secret ingredient in this serum was … wait for it … seaweed kelp.      Now my husband had a choice between living with me 24/7 with either hairy caterpillars on my face or smelling like a fresh fish market all the time.      Wanting to make sure that I wasn't missing the boat here, I thought maybe I should check with my husband, the one person who might actually care what my eyelashes looked like and how my face smelled.      "Hey honey," I said. "Do you think I need better eyelashes?"      "Is that a trick question?" he asked. "Like, 'Do these pants make me look fat?'"      "No, I just want to make sure you don't feel let down by my skimpy lashes."      "You have beautiful eyelashes and those pants don't make you look fat," he said. "Am I safe now?"      Clearly, this is not the most important issue on the planet right now, which led me to wonder why someone would think it was so essential for me to have eyelashes of any length at this moment. I'm not going to be batting them at anybody while I'm in isolation. Seriously, who am I going to impress? My dog? He has no opinion on my eyelashes whatsoever. He just wants to know when he's going to be fed, and doesn't care if I have fabulous eyelashes when I serve him his kibble.      With all this attention being paid to my eyelashes, I wondered if this was indicative of a larger beauty problem that had escaped my attention. Honestly, I didn't think I was letting myself go. I still shaved my legs and did my nails and even occasionally put on some makeup when I planned to Facetime with someone and I didn't want to scare their children if they happened to glance at the screen. So, overall, I didn't think I needed magnetic eyelashes or eyelash seaweed serum. What I did need to do was have a talk with customer service at Facebook and tell them they should focus on what's really important.      My eyebrows.

Will Kraus born on July 28, 1977, passed away unexpectedly on April 26 at his home in Warren, Maine. Will is survived by his adoring family, his father, Richard and his wife Lynn Kraus of West Barnstable, his mother, Eliza Petrovits of Maine, sister Arleigh Kraus and her partner Jeff Spear of Warren, Maine, brother Daniel Kraus of West Barnstable, and his beloved niece and nephews, Sophia, Taj, and Ulysses of Warren, Maine. He is also survived by his Aunts and Uncles, Karen and Edgar Davignon, Lexy, Noni, Tina, Genie and Mike, Valerie and Mark Petrovits, and many cousins. He also leaves behind many very special friends who will all miss his infectious smile, great laugh and quiet sensitivity. Will also loved animals and was pre-deceased by his two cherished dogs, Booker and Oden, who spent endless happy hours with their devoted owner. Will grew up on Cape Cod attending schools in Barnstable, Sandwich and Dennis-Yarmouth. Will was extremely intelligent and a master of words, as anyone who ever played scrabble with him knows. He also excelled in art and was recruited to attend some very prestigious art colleges. Instead Will chose to spend his life on and around the ocean, that was his passion. He loved to surf and fish and spent many waking hours in and around the water. His job as field crew manager at Aquaculture Research Corporation in Dennis was right up his alley working the shellfish flats in Wellfleet and Barnstable growing and harvesting clams and oysters. On and off the water, Will was a Jack of all trades, and knew how to fix anything that needed fixing. These skills also made him the perfect partner for his sister in their agriculture business in Warren, Maine, where he moved in 2014. As a youngster Will was an avid hockey player and excelled as a defenseman for the Boston Metro league. He was also an excellent baseball player and played in the Cape Cod Little League. Will had a love of speed and mechanical things that moved. His adventurous side often ended with some kind of injury and trip to the hospital. Anyone who has ever met Will has only great things to say about him. He was humble and selfless, always putting others before himself and willing to help anyone. He loved to make people laugh and played many pranks on friends and coworkers to keep things fun and lighthearted. But mostly people gravitated toward him because of his genuine unassuming kind and gentle spirit. He had a huge capacity to care for people and his large build could barely contain the enormity of his heart and soul. Family and friends will gather to memorialize Wills life at a later date when it is safe to be together. Donations may be made in his name to the MSPCA.

I restanti otto brani sono composizioni scritte da Di Benedetto, dove sempre è in gioco questo confronto a tre, questo dialogo in cui ognuno prende parola con moderazione, in punta di piedi, restando nella propria nicchia; come il Palomar di Calvino, quando "ha preso l'abitudine di mordersi la lingua tre volte prima di fare qualsiasi affermazione". Forse è proprio il clima riflessivo, la pacatezza che sottende ogni intervento, ciò che fa di Timewise l'ambiente ideale per il carattere del contrabbasso di Simone Di Benedetto, che mi piace definire ponderato e intelligente. Ancora intento a scandagliare le profondità che del succitato Depth Sounding sono il background, questa volta il nostro fa da contraltare al clarinetto di Colonna, più estroverso e sempre molto raffinato. Nel mentre le percussioni di Liuzzo restano sullo sfondo, a impreziosire in modo misurato. Ad eccezione di un passaggio più intenso e fremebondo (non a caso posto, o meglio, occorso poco prima del finale), solitamente è una pensosità assorta quella che avvolge Timewise, stemperata nelle penombre che lo rendono un lavoro non molto accessibile, ma capace di dare diverse soddisfazioni a chi volesse porgere un ascolto profondo.

"Tenemos que organizar un cambio importante en el marco normativo, en el marco regulatorio de las subastas", ha dicho, al tiempo que ha afirmado que el sistema diseñado por el anterior ministro de Energía, Álvaro Nadal, genera una señal de precio suelo más alto de lo que corresponde y no permite al consumidor beneficiarse de la reducción de los costes tecnológicos y operativos de las renovables.
 En cuanto a la captación de inversiones para rectivar la economía tras el coronavirus, ha dicho que "hay un interés muy alto por parte de inversores y de desarrolladores de proyectos, así como por industrias de soluciones de eficiencia energética y servicios energéticos, por invertir, pero para activar esas inversiones hay que contar con un marco regulatorio adecuado, que dé confianza y seguridad".
 La ministra ha valorado las medidas del Gobierno para paliar los efectos de la crisis en materia energética (suspensiones temporales de pago de los suministros de agua, luz y gas; de liquidaciones de impuestos, de la interrupción de suministros y la extensión automática del bono social y su ampliación) y cree que han funcionado bien.
 "Me parece que, en términos generales, hemos logrado algo que era importante y es que el impacto de la crisis no afectara, en general, al consumidor, pero tampoco al conjunto del sector", ha dicho la ministra, que ha añadido que eso no significa que no haya impactos.
 Según ha explicado, habrá que gestionar esos impactos y ver cómo absorber los costes extraordinarios que ha generado la crisis en el sistema energético "sin cargar sobre el consumidor doméstico esa necesidad de dar estabilidad al sistema".
 La cobertura de los desequilibrios en el sistema tendrá que venir parte de los Presupuestos Generales del Estado y parte de una actualización del funcionamiento de los sistemas eléctrico y gasista, ha dicho.
 Por otro lado, ha indicado que la industria consumidora intensiva de electricidad debe prestar atención al precio de la energía porque es un factor "importantísimo" de competitividad, pero también a otras variables que les colocan en una posición más o menos competitiva con respecto a terceros, como reinversión en innovación y procesos, evolución de sus competidores y otros.
