 The 4th of July as well as summer in general means, among many things, fireworks may be filling the sky for all who wish to see them.
 With potentially millions of people\" looking up at the sky for the fireworks, they will have a chance to see the stars beyond.
 While waiting for the pyrotechnics to begin, usually scheduled when it is just getting dark enough to see them well, twilight will be well underway.
 If you are there for sunset, watch how the Earth's lovely star descends in a deep orange and red shade, and the deepening dusk paints the west-northwestern sky in a vivid, ever-changing palette of hues.
 With the sun set, you have a clear view to the east, look low on the horizon for the moon, only one day before full phase.
 See how the moon seems bigger than normal, being low on the horizon. This is actually an optical illusion.
 Look also for a deep violet band of color along the east-southeast horizon. This is the edge of the Earth's dark shadow, making a low angle on the sky. After a short time, as the sky darkens, the shadow will no longer be visible.
 We usually don't talk about the Earth's shadow until a time of a lunar eclipse when the moon passes through, darkening and turning a reddish shade.
 The red of sunsets and sunrises and the red of a lunar eclipse are the effect of refraction. The atmosphere enveloping the spherical Earth acts like a glass lens, and bends the rays of the sun, breaking them into its component spectrum. The longer wavelengths are on the red end of the spectrum and pass through the most.
 Unfortunately during July 2020, there are no bright planets in the evening sky. Otherwise, they would be among the first points of light to appear before the fireworks take our attention.
 Given a clear sky, what you will see are the wondrous points of light from the sky's brightest stars above the horizon at the time.
 Those who would like to make a wish on the first star you see would be following a very old tradition.
 The first star to appear will be Vega, magnitude 0.1 and blue-white in shade. Look high in the eastern sky.
 Next is Arcturus, magnitude 0.2 and of a wonderful yellow-orange hue. Arcturus stands high up in the south during the twilight of early July.
 The next brightest star is Altair, 0.9 and white. Look to the lower right from Vega, in the east-southeast.
 Antares, magnitude 1.2 and colored red, shines low in the south-southeast.
 Deneb, 1.3 and white, will be to the lower left from Vega, in the east- northeastern sky.   Vega, Deneb and Altair, although in different constellations, make up the famed \"Summer Triangle.\"
 Look low in the west for Regulus, a white magnitude 1.3 star.
 By the time fireworks begin, you won't likely be tracing constellations, and the bright rockets and flares will keep you fixated at the wonders a few hundred feet above your head.
 When the fireworks are over and most everyone is packing up to go home, perhaps to get in line for the ritualistic traffic jam that is often part of the 4th of July tradition, take a moment to catch more stars in the moonlit sky.
 Over the next couple of weeks, with the return of moonless skies, take in the glory of the universe.
 Fireworks are great, but don't miss a chance to see the thousands of stars dim and bright spread over your head, and the fascinating billows of the hazy Milky Way Band that becomes so prominent as a summer evening turns towards midnight and beyond.
 Learn to find the constellations, find out more star names and, with binoculars, hunt down even more treasures from star clusters to dim and very distant galaxies within your reach. The view is endless and waits to be seen!   Keep looking up at the sky!

WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. officials will provide a classified briefing for congressional leaders Thursday about the intelligence assessment that Russia offered bounties for killing U.S. troops in Afghanistan. The meeting comes as President Donald Trump, who says he wasn't briefed on the information because it wasn't verified, is under increasing pressure to provide answers about the U.S. response to Russia or the lack of one. Democrats briefed at the White House this week suggested Trump was bowing to Russian President Vladimir Putin at the risk of U.S. soldiers' lives.Intelligence officials, including CIA Director Gina Haspel and Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe, will brief the so-called Gang of Eight lawmakers — Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the top Republicans and Democrats on the two intelligence committees — in a classified meeting on Capitol Hill Thursday morningTrump has called the intelligence assessments a "hoax" and insisted he hadn't been briefed on them because the intelligence didn't rise to his level. However, national security adviser Robert O'Brien said the CIA and the Pentagon pursued the leads and briefed international allies. At a State Department news conference, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Wednesday the situation was handled "incredibly well" to ensure the safety of U.S. troops. "We took this seriously, we handled it appropriately," Pompeo said, without giving additional details. He said the administration receives intelligence about threats to Americans "every single day" and each is addressed.Pompeo added that Russian activity in Afghanistan is nothing new and that Russia is just one of many nations acting there. He said that Congress has had similar information in the past and that he often receives threat assessments that don't rise to the level of a presidential briefing. The intelligence assessments that Russia offered bounties were first reported by The New York Times, then confirmed to The Associated Press by American intelligence officials and others with knowledge of the matter.The White House has insisted that Trump wasn't briefed on the assessments because they hadn't been "verified." White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany pointed to an individual who she said made the decision not to brief Trump, identifying the person as a female CIA officer with more than 30 years of experience. O'Brien, the national security adviser, said the person was a "career CIA briefer." Trump remained defensive about the intelligence on Wednesday, dismissing stories about it as "Fake News" made up to "damage me and the Republican Party." Later, Trump said that it was a hoax and "we never heard about it" because intelligence officials didn't think it rose to that level. "The intelligence people, many of them didn't believe it happened at all," Trump said on Fox Business. O'Brien said the intelligence wasn't brought to Trump's attention initially because it was unverified and there was no consensus among the intelligence community. But it's rare for intelligence to be confirmed without a shadow of doubt before it is presented to senior government decision-makers.Senate Republicans appeared split on the matter, with several defending the president and saying that the Russian meddling wasn't new. Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson, chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, said Trump "can't be made aware of every piece of unverified intelligence." Others expressed strong concern. Sen. Patrick Toomey of Pennsylvania said he had reviewed classified documents regarding the potential bounties "upon which recent news reports are based" and said the information raises many questions. "If it is concluded that Russia offered bounties to murder American soldiers, a firm American response is required in short order," Toomey said. Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley said that if the reports are true, "it demands a strong response, and I don't mean a diplomatic response."House Democrats briefed this week at the White House questioned why Trump wouldn't have been briefed sooner and pushed for Trump to make a strong statement. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff said it was "inexplicable" that Trump won't say publicly that he is working to get to the bottom of the issue and won't call out Putin. He said Trump's defense that he hadn't been briefed was inexcusable. "Many of us do not understand his affinity for that autocratic ruler who means our nation ill," Schiff said. While Russian meddling in Afghanistan isn't new, officials said Russian operatives had become more aggressive in their desire to contract with the Taliban and members of the Haqqani Network, a militant group aligned with the Taliban in Afghanistan and designated a foreign terrorist organization in 2012. The intelligence community has been investigating an April 2019 attack on an American convoy that killed three U.S. Marines when a car rigged with explosives detonated near their armored vehicles as they traveled back to Bagram Airfield, the largest U.S. military installation in Afghanistan, officials told the AP. Three other U.S. service members were wounded in the attack, along with an Afghan contractor. The Taliban claimed responsibility. The officials the AP spoke to also said they were looking closely at insider attacks from 2019 to determine if they were linked to Russian bounties.Intelligence officials told the AP that the White House first became aware of alleged Russian bounties in early 2019 — a year earlier than had been previously reported. The assessments were included in one of Trump's written daily briefings at the time, and then-national security adviser John Bolton had told colleagues he had briefed Trump on the matter.___Associated Press writers Zeke Miller, Lisa Mascaro, Alan Fram, Matthew Daly and Deb Riechmann in Washington and Jonathan Lemire in Mystic, Connecticut, contributed to this report.Copyright 2020 Associated Press.

Moore, a basketball superstar in her prime, announced in January she would skip a second season to focus on criminal justice reform.
 "When we take time to stand up for people, and to shine a light in a dark place, not everybody is going to like it," she had said. "When it costs your comfort or maybe something that you just want to kind of check out and enjoy, I get that.
 "Entertainment is a place where you want to relax and not have to think about the cares of the world, but we are in the world and the world is broken. So hats off to people that sacrifice, that pay a cost of a platform, of a job, of money to stand up for something greater than yourselves and at the end of the day, if we remember we're human beings first, I think it'll make it a little less controversial."
 She's considered one of the greatest women's basketball players -- and winners -- of all time. Her resume is full of superlatives. Selected by the Minnesota Lynx as the No. 1 overall pick in the 2011 WNBA draft, Moore went on to win the league's rookie of the year award and her first WNBA title in her first season. She added titles in 2013, 2015 and 2017, winning WNBA Finals MVP honors in 2013 and the WNBA MVP award in 2014.
 As a member of Team USA, Moore won Olympic gold in 2012 and 2016 as well as two world championships in 2010 and 2014. When she played in college at the University of Connecticut, the Huskies went undefeated in back-to-back seasons, winning national titles in 2009 and 2010.

In Belfast, the RUC arrested Giuseppe Forte, who owned the Continental Cafe in Castle Street and Antonio Fusco, whose family owned a chip shop in York Street. They were taken to Liverpool to board the Arandora Star.   Angelo Morelli, of Portstewart, was stopped at the gangway because the ship was full, taken to the Isle of Man internment camp in Douglas and later released to build the catering business that remains at the heart of Portstewart today.   On July 1 the Arandora Star sailed with 1,200 German and Italian prisoners, guarded by 200 soldiers, and next morning she was torpedoed by a U-boat 75 miles west of Ireland.   Hundreds were rescued by a Canadian destroyer but more than 800 were lost and for weeks their bodies would be washed ashore along 600 miles of coastline from the Western Isles of Scotland to Co Mayo.   The first came ashore in Mayo four weeks after the sinking and a few days later an Atlantic storm brought a terrible harvest. The Western People reported that up to 100 bodies were seen floating off Inishkea Island, the seas so rough that they could not be recovered.   The newspapers reported each grim discovery, stating that the unknown victims had been buried alongside the soldiers, who had been identified by their Army dogtags and paybooks. The soldiers were named in the burial registers, the unknowns were not and we realised that the shallow depressions between the Army headstones were the graves of the unknowns.   Soon, the councils had to reopen old graveyards, some dating from the Famine almost 100 years before. Donegal Board of Health was told that 33 bodies had been washed ashore during the previous week and that funeral expenses had been paid by board officers out of their own pockets.

Cuisine de France owner Aryzta needs to sell at least €600m worth of assets in order to cut its debt to more manageable levels, activist shareholders have insisted. In a scathing assessment this morning of the Swiss-Irish group's performance in the past few years, the shareholders – Switzerland&rsquo;s Veraison and Spain&rsquo;s Cobas - claimed the group has failed to deliver on promises.They also revealed that they now own more than 20pc of Aryzta&rsquo;s shares between them, up from 17.8pc.They also claimed the bakery group – whose customers include McDonald&rsquo;s, Subway, Walmart, Dunnes Stores and Lidl - has not even sought to interview three board candidates proposed by the investors, or sought other information regarding them, despite an extraordinary general meeting due to take place next month where the activists will attempt to have the candidates elected to the Aryzta board.The activists are also plotting to oust Aryzta chairman Gary McGann and four other board members. While the shareholders said they plan to remove Kevin Toland from the board, they would retain him as chief executive. However, it&rsquo;s believed they would also be open to Mr Toland remaining on the board.During a presentation this morning, Veraison chief executive Andreas Weigelt said Aryzta needs to do more to cut debt. The shareholders propose that a fresh look at Aryzta&rsquo;s options will be undertaken if their candidates are elected once they have better visibility on the nuts and bolts of the baking group&rsquo;s operations, including its granular financial performance.Investment bank Rothschild is already undertaking a separate strategic review of Aryzta on behalf of the baked goods giant.Mr Weigelt said he&rsquo;s &ldquo;fully aligned&rdquo; with what Kevin Toland said in late 2018 that the group&rsquo;s net debt to EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) ratio needs to be between 2.5 and 3 times.Mr Weigelt said for the first half of this financial year, Aryzta&rsquo;s net debt – including €906m of so-called hybrid debt – totals €1.47bn, giving it a net debt to EBITDA ratio of 7.3 times.He insisted that even taking Aryzta&rsquo;s EBITDA last year, before Covid hit, Aryzta&rsquo;s net debt to EBITDA would still be at a ratio of five times.&ldquo;If your debt level is higher [than 2.5 to 3 times], you are constantly focused on delivering liquidity,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have the flexibility, you don&rsquo;t have the room for manoeuvre that you need to really develop the business further.&rdquo;&ldquo;Total debt would have to be reduced by €600m,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;If we look at the amount of cash Aryzta generated over the past few years, there has not been a positive cash generation in the last two years to repay debt. On average, over the last five years, it has been limited to €80m. So it becomes very clear that also before corona hit, it was never possible to bring the financial leverage back to a normal basis with the cash generation that Aryzta achieved.&rdquo;The shareholders and their board candidates have insisted that they won&rsquo;t undertake a fire-sale of Aryzta assets. Aryzta generated revenue of just under €3.4bn in its last financial year.Aryzta has been asked for comment.

Still, signing Cam Newton elevates the ceiling at the quarterback position for the Patriots significantly, and gives the team much more flexibility on offense to get creative with its running game. While he isn’t the accurate passer that Tom Brady was by any stretch of the imagination, Newton brings an element to the Patriots offense that New England fans haven’t seen before, and is a great fit for a team that is transitioning to a scheme-flexible, run- first offense in 2020. If Newton can clean up his mechanics, protect his body, and learn the Patriots’ offense quickly, New England could be a bigger threat with Newton as quarterback than it was with Tom Brady last season.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court is denying Congress access to secret grand jury testimony from special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation through the November election.The justices agreed on Thursday to hear the Trump administration's appeal of a lower court order for the material to be turned over to the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives. The high court's action will keep the documents out of congressional hands at least until the case is resolved, which is not likely to happen before 2021.Arguments themselves might not even take place before Americans decide whether to give President Donald Trump a second term.The delay is a victory for Trump, who also is mounting a Supreme Court fight against congressional efforts to obtain his banking and other financial records. Those cases are expected to be decided in the coming days or weeks.The court's action also could mean the justices never have to reach a definitive ruling in a sensitive dispute between the executive and legislative branches of government, if either Trump loses reelection or Republicans regain control of the House next year. It's hard to imagine an administration of Democrat Joe Biden would object to turning over the Mueller documents or House Republicans would continue to press for them.The House wants previously undisclosed details from the investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election.The federal appeals court in Washington ruled in March that the documents should be turned over because the House Judiciary Committee's need for the material in its investigation of Trump outweighed the Justice Department's interests in keeping the testimony secret. Mueller's 448-page report, issued in April 2019, "stopped short" of reaching conclusions about Trump's conduct, including whether he obstructed justice, to avoid stepping on the House's impeachment power, the appeals court said. The committee was able to persuasively argue that it needed access to the underlying grand jury material to make its own determinations about the president's actions, the court said.The materials initially were sought last summer, but by the time the appeals court ruled in March, Trump had been impeached by the House and acquitted by the Senate.The Justice Department said in its Supreme Court filings that the court's action was needed in part because the House hasn't given any indication it "urgently needs these materials for any ongoing impeachment investigation."The House had opposed the delay on the grounds that its investigation of Trump was continuing and that time is of the essence because of the approaching election. The current session of the House will end Jan. 3, and lawmakers elected in November will take their seats.Democrats have suggested that the grand jury materials could reveal new misconduct that could potentially form the basis of new articles of impeachment, but such a course would have been unlikely so close to the 2020 election even if the court had allowed the material to be turned over immediately.The House impeached Trump for his efforts to get Ukraine to dig up dirt on Biden, but the Republican-controlled Senate acquitted the president in February.It is also unclear how many new, or incendiary, revelations might be contained in the grand jury transcripts. Mueller's report, though redacted in parts, revealed more than a year ago significant information about the president's efforts to choke off the investigation and raised substantial questions about whether he had committed obstruction of justice.Besides, many of the witnesses closest to Trump appeared voluntarily before Mueller's team of prosecutors, and the Justice Department in recent months has released written — albeit redacted — summaries of those interviews. That means the public already has insight into the accounts of key Trump associates including son-in-law Jared Kushner and advisers like Steve Bannon and Hope Hicks. ___Associated Press writer Eric Tucker contributed to this report.Copyright 2020 Associated Press.

The 4th of July as well as summer in general means, among many things, fireworks may be filling the sky for all who wish to see them.      With potentially millions of people" looking up at the sky for the fireworks, they will have a chance to see the stars beyond.      While waiting for the pyrotechnics to begin, usually scheduled when it is just getting dark enough to see them well, twilight will be well underway.      If you are there for sunset, watch how the Earth's lovely star descends in a deep orange and red shade, and the deepening dusk paints the west-northwestern sky in a vivid, ever-changing palette of hues.      With the sun set, you have a clear view to the east, look low on the horizon for the moon, only one day before full phase.      See how the moon seems bigger than normal, being low on the horizon. This is actually an optical illusion.      Look also for a deep violet band of color along the east-southeast horizon. This is the edge of the Earth's dark shadow, making a low angle on the sky. After a short time, as the sky darkens, the shadow will no longer be visible.      We usually don't talk about the Earth's shadow until a time of a lunar eclipse when the moon passes through, darkening and turning a reddish shade.      The red of sunsets and sunrises and the red of a lunar eclipse are the effect of refraction. The atmosphere enveloping the spherical Earth acts like a glass lens, and bends the rays of the sun, breaking them into its component spectrum. The longer wavelengths are on the red end of the spectrum and pass through the most.      Unfortunately during July 2020, there are no bright planets in the evening sky. Otherwise, they would be among the first points of light to appear before the fireworks take our attention.      Given a clear sky, what you will see are the wondrous points of light from the sky's brightest stars above the horizon at the time.      Those who would like to make a wish on the first star you see would be following a very old tradition.      The first star to appear will be Vega, magnitude 0.1 and blue-white in shade. Look high in the eastern sky.      Next is Arcturus, magnitude 0.2 and of a wonderful yellow-orange hue. Arcturus stands high up in the south during the twilight of early July.      The next brightest star is Altair, 0.9 and white. Look to the lower right from Vega, in the east-southeast.      Antares, magnitude 1.2 and colored red, shines low in the south-southeast.      Deneb, 1.3 and white, will be to the lower left from Vega, in the east- northeastern sky.   Vega, Deneb and Altair, although in different constellations, make up the famed "Summer Triangle."      Look low in the west for Regulus, a white magnitude 1.3 star.      By the time fireworks begin, you won't likely be tracing constellations, and the bright rockets and flares will keep you fixated at the wonders a few hundred feet above your head.      When the fireworks are over and most everyone is packing up to go home, perhaps to get in line for the ritualistic traffic jam that is often part of the 4th of July tradition, take a moment to catch more stars in the moonlit sky.      Over the next couple of weeks, with the return of moonless skies, take in the glory of the universe.      Fireworks are great, but don't miss a chance to see the thousands of stars dim and bright spread over your head, and the fascinating billows of the hazy Milky Way Band that becomes so prominent as a summer evening turns towards midnight and beyond.      Learn to find the constellations, find out more star names and, with binoculars, hunt down even more treasures from star clusters to dim and very distant galaxies within your reach. The view is endless and waits to be seen!   Keep looking up at the sky!      Peter Becker is managing editor at The News Eagle in Hawley, Pennsylvania. Notes are welcome at news@neagle.com.

It’s no secret Idaho is a great place to fish. Blue-ribbon trout streams and quality bass fisheries are plentiful. We have Chinook salmon, steelhead and jumbo perch. We’re even home to the world-record tiger muskie!

With a shorter growing season, Idaho cats don’t often reach the size of their southern counterparts, but his point remains — the Snake is absolutely loaded with cats, although many anglers either don’t realize it or don’t care to target them.
