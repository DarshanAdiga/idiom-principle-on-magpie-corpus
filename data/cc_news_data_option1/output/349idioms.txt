Saturday is still a bit up in the air. Our next storm system approaches and the two big questions are, how warm will we be and where does the storm track. Most recent model runs are showing a track that is in favor of the storm moving further south, which will favor less impacts for our area. However, slight changes in the track could bring messy conditions for our weekend in the form of rain and snow. We will have to continue to watch it over the next few days.

“Each time you win, you gain more confidence," said Boitano, the 1988 Olympic gold medalist and a two-time world winner. “After Nathan won his first world championship, on ice he was like a different man.

That's part of his toughness and sense of accomplishment."

DeMarco Murray's stay at Arizona was always likely to be brief. It is no secret that he envisions one day coaching at the next level and there is plenty of belief that he will get the opportunity to do so in the future. In the meantime, he began to cut his teeth as a coach with the Wildcats coming on board last January when he was hired by head coach Kevin Sumlin to lead the team's running back unit and replace Clarence McKinney in Tucson.
 Murray is now set to leave UA for his alma mater, Oklahoma, in a return to Norman where he turned into a star running back as a college player.
 The Las Vegas native was at Oklahoma from 2007-10, and he was able to rush for over 3,600 yards and 50 touchdowns during that time leading to Murray being selected by the Dallas Cowboys in the NFL Draft at the end of his college career.
 He spent most of the last decade in the pro ranks and earned NFL All-Pro status during that time on a pro journey that took him from Dallas to Philadelphia and then Tennessee.
 Sumlin was able to pull Murray away from the TV world where he was a broadcaster in his first season after retirement from the NFL back in 2018.
 At Arizona, Murray helped the Wildcats become the third-best rushing team in the Pac-12 continuing a trend for the team's most dynamic group. Although he was only on board as a recruiter for a year he was successful in that area helping the program acquire plenty of talent in his short stay highlighted by his ability to add running backs including freshman Michael Wiley, 2020 signee Jalen John and 2020 commit Frank Brown.
 Still in his early 30s, Murray provided the Wildcats with energy on a coaching staff that has already gone through plenty of changes. That spark is something that helped convince Sumlin that Murray was the right man for the job at UA despite a lack of experience as a coach.
 "We interviewed a lot of people and his knowledge of the game, his ability to present the information was as good as anybody's," Sumlin said after hiring Murray last year.
 Murray was able to make an impact on UA's players during his short time on campus by providing guidance in several areas, both on and off the field, for several members of the team.
 "He's taught us a lot," UA running back Nathan Tilford said during the season. "He's taught us a lot on the field and off the field. I'm becoming a better player ... and also just becoming a better man in general."
 The Wildcats will now have to find yet another replacement to lead a running back unit that returns four scholarship players who all contributed in some way during the 2019 season and remains the team's deepest position group.
 The new coach will be the fourth to different person to lead the Arizona running back unit in the last four seasons. It will also be the fourth coaching change the Wildcats will have to make this offseason after replacing three coaches on the defensive side of the ball in the last month.

Common Admission Test, or CAT is a screening based on a computer based ability test which tests the students for the topmost institute of management in India that is the Indian Institute of Management or IIMs, which is the cream of management institutes and can be drawn as a parallel to the Indian Institute of Technology or IITs. The constituents parts of the CAT questionnaire The screening of Common Admission Test happens on the basis of four major sections, that is, the Logical Reasoning or LR, the Quantitative Ability test, commonly known as QA, the candidate’s reading comprehension or their RC according to the management jargon, their verbal ability or VA and finally, candidates’ skills of Data Interpretation. This admission test is supervised annually for the selection of worthy students who are sharp and smart enough to crack into one of the top management schools of India for Post Graduation and for diploma courses. Once this tedious screening and selection process is done with, the results are usually published during the first two weeks of January. After the publication of the results, the IIMs generally release the candidates shortlisted for their Personal Interviews and those who can appear for the Writing Ability Test. This whole process usually starts from February and typically go on till May, varying from one IIM to the other. However, the greatest advantage of the Common Admission Test is that there is no bar in the number of attempts a candidate can undertake, while there are a lot of examination which allows this sort of freedom, an added benefit of Common Admission Test is also the allowance of a no upper age limit, i.e, there is absolutely no barrier for an age limit for which a candidate can appear for the Common Admission Test exams. This is done to ensure that an individual who is a business management aspirant is able to appear for the examination at any point in their lifetime, and what appears is the council elected for Common Admission Test believe in the fact that there is no appropriate age for acquiring knowledge, and hence, they keep an open standard. However, it is to be noted that despite the Common Admission Test examinations having no upper age limit, the most premier institute conducting their admissions on the basis of the said examination has an upper age limit. Stay connected with fellow students on PaGaLGuY for CAT 2020 Discussion All you need to know about the eligibility criteria As per the eligibility criteria of IIM Ahmedabad (which is the numero uno IIM) released in March of 2019, the upper age limit for being an MBA or Master in Business and Administration was twenty seven years. This is done to ensure a fair and square competition among the candidates appearing for the examination, for someone who is older might definitely have a more refined experience and hence would obviously outsmart the people who are appearing in their amateurish years would lag behind. The council wanted to ensure that we have a fair competition among the aspirants. It is a common misunderstanding that this should be reducing competition for IIMs, but on the contrary, the CAT Exam has no provision of an upper age limit, only the IIMs do, and since the admission to the IIMs is on the basis of the CAT entrance examinations, the competition stays as it

MBA or Master’s in Business Administration is one of the most sought-after educational qualifications in the present times. In addition to preparing excellently skilled individuals to handle complex workplace problems, MBA is also addressing another important issue at the workplace, gender diversity. The benefits of gender diversity at the workplace extend beyond the obvious advantage of women empowerment. Research has proven that gender-diverse teams are more likely to make better decisions in the workplace. Women are traditionally known to have a better knack for building networks and consensus in addition to the elements of insights and empathy ingrained in their personality. Thus having more females at the workplace as well as in the board of directors will be a sensible move from the management. Additionally, After the introduction of the Companies Act 2013, it is now mandatory for the listed companies to have at least one female director on their board of directors. As a result, the demand for qualified women who can handle management responsibilities has literally skyrocketed. Consequently, now the presentation of women in the top management is on an upward trajectory with more and more women now handling key managerial positions. Though, the supply side of the chain is still a work in progress with the roots of gender disparity stemming from deep within. Now, educational institutions in India are leading the change and are encouraging gender diversity in their programs. Leading the movement are popular business schools like TAPMI. TAPMI is a pioneer management institute that is setting new benchmarks in terms of gender diversity. In order to ensure gender diverse classrooms, the institute has introduced various innovative ways at different selection stages to ensure a better representation of female candidates. TAPMI has recently. As per the latest reports shared by the institute, the total representation of female students now stands at 32%, i.e. almost one-third of the students studying the postgraduate programs at the university are female students. To promote gender diversity, TAPMI is providing 5% additional score to female candidates in the selection process. Additionally, many more business schools have set new benchmarks this year by ensuring better representation of female students. This trend should not be considered as diminishing meritocracy. As a matter of fact, according to a leading business school, the average stipend achieved by female candidates is approximately 24% higher than their male counterparts. Even the recruiters are now encouraging gender diversity, and many companies that used to hire a higher number of male candidates are now hiring equal number of male and female candidates. It would not be an exaggeration to say that in the coming years, women will have even better representation at leadership positions.
