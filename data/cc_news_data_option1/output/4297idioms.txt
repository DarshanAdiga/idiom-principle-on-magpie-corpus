Defending champions Richmond Tigers crushed Geelong Cats to win the Australian Football League grand final on Saturday, culminating the sport's most turbulent and unpredictable season in decades.
 World number one tennis star and staunch Tigers fan Ashleigh Barty handed skipper Trent Cotchin the trophy after Richmond won 12.9 (81) to 7.8 (50) for their third title in four years.
 "Credit to the boys, they just continue to show the resilience that we know they can," said Cotchin.
 "We came out here (Queensland) something like 110 days ago treating it like an adventure and it's been one hell of an adventure. To finish off like this is simply outstanding."
 Both clubs are from Victoria and ordinarily the decider of Australia's most popular spectator sport would be played at the cavernous Melbourne Cricket Ground in front of 100,000 fans.
 But all sides from the state -- who make up most of the 18-team ladder -- have been forced to play their games elsewhere this season after a resurgence of Covid-19 in Victoria.
 That meant Brisbane's famed cricket ground the Gabba hosted the final -- only the second time since World War II it has not been at the MCG -- with just 30,000 spectators allowed.
 Queensland-based Barty is a devoted Tigers fan and said ahead of the game she was honoured to be asked to hand over the trophy.
 "I have loved watching the Tigers on my travels, supporting them has been a constant source of enjoyment for me on the road," she said.
 "I know there are many other Richmond people who would normally do this but given the circumstances I am very grateful for the opportunity."
 Barty would usually be busy playing tennis, but opted against defending her French Open title over coronavirus fears and also missed the US Open.
 Richmond's win culminated a bizarre season that began in March but was called off after just one match due to the pandemic, unprecedented for a sport that first established a league in 1896.
 A dynamic game similar to Ireland's Gaelic football, it resumed in mid June.
 But with the virus flaring up again in Melbourne, all teams were forced to base themselves outside of Victoria, with many spending more than 100 days on the road.

As housing costs have skyrocketed across the state, the Democratic-controlled Legislature and Gov. Gavin Newsom have done relatively little to ease the pain felt by millions of renters. The sharp rise in housing costs has accelerated the slow-burn disaster set in motion a quarter-century ago by Costa-Hawkins, exposing the confluence of market and governmental failures to meet a basic human need -- that of safe, affordable shelter.
 It is hard to overstate the magnitude of California's housing disaster, and equally difficult to measure the pain it has caused. How many families have been evicted? How many kids have been stripped of the security of decent housing?
 How many breadwinners have been denied precious time with their children by exhausting commutes to and from semi-affordable outposts hours away from underpaid jobs? This is the new reality that our broken housing system has engendered -- a reality that Prop. 21 seeks to change.
 In politics, as in other spheres of our lives, we often must wrestle with the past in order to secure a better future. This election year, California's misdeeds from the last decades of the 20th century sit squarely on the November ballot, inviting voters to take stock and choose a different path forward.

CONAKRY, Guinea (AP) — Guinea’s President Alpha Conde has won a third term with 59.49% of the vote, the National Independent Electoral Commission declared Saturday. Some people went to the streets to protest immediately after the announcement. Such demonstrations have occurred for months after the government changed the constitution through a national referendum, allowing Conde to extend his decade in power. Opposition candidate Cellou Dalein Diallo received 33.50% of the vote, the electoral commission said. Voter turnout was almost 80%. Political tensions around the election in the West African nation turned violent in recent days after Diallo claimed victory ahead of the official results. Celebrations by his supporters were suppressed when security forces fired tear gas to disperse them. At least nine people have been killed since the election, according to the government. The violence sparked international condemnation by the U.S. and others. “Today is a sad day for African democracy,” said Sally Bilaly Sow, a Guinean blogger and activist living abroad. The government should take into account the will of the people who have a desire for change, he said. On Friday, internet and international calls were cut off across the West African nation in anticipation of the election results, according to locals and international observers in the capital, Conakry. This was the third time that Conde matched- up against Diallo. Before the election, observers raised concerns that an electoral dispute could reignite ethnic tensions between Guinea’s largest ethnic groups.

Cosmetics and toiletries products containing chemicals have been used by people for thousands of years to enhance beauty, maintain hygiene, health, and for other uses. Demand for cosmetics and toiletries products has increased dramatically in the last few years owing to the growing consumer inclination towards using anti-aging and sun-protection formulations to stay young and protect themselves from the harmful effect of UV and environmental pollution. The global cosmetics and personal care industry was valued at approximately US$ 330 billion in 2015. Cosmetics and toiletries products contain a wide range of chemicals for specific functions. Most of these formulations include colorants, hardeners, UV filters, preservatives, antioxidants, emollients, surfactants, emulsifiers, and fragrances. Ingredients of these chemicals could be synthetic or naturally occurring substances. Water used in the cosmetics and toiletries formulations should be ultra-pure and free from toxins, microbes, and other pollutants. Emulsifiers are used to keep oil and water from separating in the mixture. Preservatives are added to chemical formulations to prevent the growth of micro-organisms such as fungi and bacteria and extend their shelf life. Few of the preservatives used in the cosmetics and toiletries products are benzyl alcohol, salicylic acid, parabens, formaldehyde, and tetra-sodium EDTA. Thickening agents are used to give an attractive consistency to the product. There are mainly four types of thickeners i.e. lipid thickener, naturally derived thickener, mineral thickener, and synthetic thickener. Emollient is another chemical ingredient used in the cosmetics and toiletries products to soften the skin while preventing the water loss.

Halloween, more than almost any other holiday, is about fun. It's like New Year's, but with corn syrup instead of booze.      It began with the Gaelic festival Samhain, which celebrated the end of harvest while ushering in the dark half of the year, a spooky time when the boundaries between the living and spirit worlds were thought to become more porous. Brought to America by Irish and Scottish settlers, Halloween found footholds in the southern colonies, and developed a more playful, mischievous, and decidedly corny vibe.      Candy corn didn't start out as a Halloween treat but jumped on the bandwagon in the 1950s, as Halloween pivoted into a full embrace of processed sugar.      Corn officially became spooky with the release of "Children of the Corn," a 1984 movie about a Midwestern village where the kids took over and decided nobody was permitted to age beyond 17. In 1993, the world's first for-profit corn maze was built in Annville, Pennsylvania. Since then the tradition has taken off, and corn mazes now number in the thousands.      When I lived in New Mexico I learned about chicos, a type of Native American dried corn. "Chicos" means "little boys" in Spanish, as the kernels shrink when dried. The ones for sale at the store were dried to the hardness of popcorn, but when I make them at home I let them stay a bit chewy, like real- life versions of candy corn. Each batch of chicos has a unique character, with different levels of brown, crunchiness, chewiness and/or sweetness, depending on the corn and how long it's roasted.      Many Halloween corn mazes are closed this year, thanks to COVID-19. And door- to-door candy-begging is largely out, too. If treat-seekers are left to their own devices I'm fine with that, because processed sugar is poison, and a tradition that hinges on giving candy to kids isn't worth rescuing.      So allow me to tell you how I make chicos. I made about three dozen ears' worth, which won't last too long but is a nice stash. I will follow my chicos tips with a few recipes, one sweet and one savory, for how I used them.      Chicos   The only ingredient is corn, preferably with the husk on. Traditionally, the process involves a clay oven or "horno," but other ovens work, too. Ultimately, you're doing little more than drying out corn.      Although usually made with fresh corn, I've also made chicos with frozen corn, and the operation was surprisingly successful, even if the product lacked the soulful smokey flavor that a roasted corn husk imparts.      Turn the oven to 300 F and place the ears directly on the oven racks, not touching one another, and bake until the husks start to dry out and brown and even smoke a little, about three hours. When cool, peel off the husks. If using husked or frozen corn, skip this step.      Turn oven down to 225. Put the cobs on the oven racks, spaced so as not to touch one another, and bake until the kernels start to shrink and visibly dry out, about four hours. Let the ears cool completely, and rub off the kernels -- use the edge of a spoon if they are stubborn. Store in a plastic bag in a cool, dry place. The drier you get them, the longer they will store.      If making chicos from frozen corn, spread the kernels on a cookie sheet and bake at 225. They will take less time -- about two hours -- and will quickly turn brown and then black.      Chicos and Milk   Fill a bowl with chicos and milk, with sugar to taste. When the chicos are gone and you sip the sweet milk that remains, you may feel a distinct deja vu to a time, long ago, when you sipped the sweet leftover milk from a bowl of corn flakes or Frosted Flakes.      Beans with Chicos   A handful of chicos turns a pot of beans into something interesting and delightful. Served alongside rice, you've got a delicious meal with complete protein.   Serves 2   • 1 strip bacon (optional, recommended), chopped   • 1 tablespoon olive oil if skipping the bacon or if it's lean   • ½ cup minced onions   • 1 clove garlic, minced   • 1 teaspoon minced fresh oregano or thyme   • ¼ cup chicos   • 1 can plain beans (pinto, white, black, kidney) including the liquid   • 1 can water or stock   • 1 teaspoon paprika or chile powder to taste   • Salt, if the bacon doesn't add enough   Fry the bacon on medium heat. When half-crispy, about five minutes, add the onions, garlic and herbs. Fry until the onions become translucent. Add the chicos, beans, water and paprika, and stir together. Season with salt, if necessary. Heat to a simmer, stirring as necessary to prevent sticking. Adjust seasoning and serve.
