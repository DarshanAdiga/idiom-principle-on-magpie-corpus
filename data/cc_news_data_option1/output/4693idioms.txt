Having seen the way in which international team-mate Bale has regained that little spring in his step after rejoining Spurs, James may well feel that something similar will need to happen soon.
 Yes, it hasn't all gone to plan for Bale on his return to North London, but even those within the Wales set-up have noticed just how much he appears to be enjoying his football now that he's at a club where he truly feels appreciated.
 United have insisted that they do still have plans for James, although that may well be more to do with their failure to land long-term target Jadon Sancho than anything else.
 A much-touted loan exit was categorically ruled out back in the summer, but it wouldn't be a surprise if it was revisted as a possibility in January, particularly with the imminent arrival of exciting teenage winger Amad Diallo from Atalanta, who signed in a deal worth £40million and who will join the Old Trafford ranks in six weeks' time.
 For the sake of his development, and his chances of shining at Euro 2020, James can't afford to slip down the pecking order any further.
 And, should the stance over a loan soften when the window reopens, there are likely to be potential suitors available.
 Long-term admirers Leeds United, whose enthusiasm for the player hasn't exactly been a secret, would likely still be keen if there's a deal to be done, and there would be few complaining about the prospect of James playing under Marcelo Bielsa.
 What's more, a loan away doesn't necessarily signal the end of his United career.

Embassy REIT, a publicly-listed REIT, on Tuesday announced it has agreed to purchase Embassy TechVillage's assets from affiliates of Embassy Sponsor, Blackstone Sponsor and other selling shareholders for a total consideration of ₹9,782.4 crore ($1.3 billion), subject to regulatory approvals.
 Embassy REIT is exercising its right under the rights of first offer (ROFO) agreement to acquire the realty asset. The acquisition comprises 6.1 million square feet of completed area, 3.1 msf of under-construction area, of which 36% is pre-leased to JP Morgan, and two proposed 518-keys Hilton hotels within the overall ETV campus.
 Speaking to the media in a virtual meet Mike Holland, Chief Executive Officer of Embassy REIT said, “ETV is a unique large scale business park, in the Outer Ring Road sub-market of Bengaluru, with a diversified blue-chip and predominantly multinational occupier base, including JP Morgan, Cisco, Sony and Flipkart. The acquisition deepens our presence in Bengaluru, which remains India’s strongest office market”.
 The REIT proposes to fund this Rs 9800 crore acquisition by issuing equity of ₹6,000 crore billion through a combination of an institutional placement of ₹3,700 crore, and by way of a preferential issue of units to third-party selling shareholders of ₹2,300 crore, as per the company.
 Jitendra Virwani, Chairman & Founder of the Embassy Group said, “Embassy Group will continue to develop top quality office assets across the country, thereby providing the REIT with a potential pipeline of assets that will help it grow inorganically over the coming years”.
 Responding to a media query on the impact of work-from-home on commercial realty, Mr. Holland said, the sector was still growing in the Asian markets with India and Bangaluru leading the wave.

Betting on China made sense during the Cold War and in light of what appeared to be legitimate reform inside China. The failure of Washington and its allies to conduct due diligence over the succeeding decades, questioning whether Beijing was living up to its promises and was becoming a cooperative nation upholding international norms, gave the CCP a free hand to build up its global power while eliminating any threats to its continued control. By the end of the Obama administration, the severity of the challenge could no longer be ignored or explained away as the result of a China still attempting to find its way in the world.

Corsairs, filibusters, swashbucklers, buccaneers, renegades: the rich lexicon of piracy in our vocabulary of rebellion attests the role they have long played in the collective imagination. But there is a complex history from which they sprang on onto the global stage. The rise of the pirate as a dangerously desirable figure is intimately linked to the maritime expansion conducted by several European nations in the early modern period, that coalesced into the creation of Empires and colonies through which European powers came to dominate world history by the 19th century. This module reads against the grain of those dominant narratives of colonialism as world-making by focusing on the pirate as an interruptive force, who derails the movement of peoples, goods, ideas, and laws across the maritime routes linking the Atlantic and Indian Ocean worlds. Important tools in the module will be the reading practices of postcolonial theory, which will teach us to extract and assess this alternative history of the post/colonial pirate.

Pet boardings in the city often come in handy for those looking for a suitable place to temporarily put up their pets in times of need. "Often it is when pet owners face the need to travel or if the household organises any function or event and have visitors. At other times, it may be a death in the family or a hospital situation," says Parvathy Mohan who runs a pet stay Edaneram at Kudappanakunnu that offers "hostel" facilities for canines, cats and birds. The owners are encouraged to do a "recce" of sorts of the facility first for their own assessment and have an open conversation about the pet's behavioural patterns and food preferences to ensure the animals feel cosy during the sojourn.
 Software engineer Ashish Benson is someone who finds pet boarding quite useful. An avid traveller, he drops his pet dog, Zoey, a Labrador, at a boarding facility whenever he gears up to hit the road. "I feel it is a handy service as long as the dogs are not put in kennels but rather given freedom," he points out.

The U.S. decision comes just days after Trump installed a new slate of loyalists in top Pentagon positions who share his frustration with the continued troop presence in the war zones. The expected plans would cut U.S. troop numbers almost in half by Jan. 15, leaving 2,500 troops in Afghanistan.
 U.S. officials said military leaders were told over the weekend about the planned withdrawal and that an executive order is in the works but has not yet been delivered to commanders.
 NATO took charge of the international security effort in Afghanistan in 2003, two years after a U.S-led coalition ousted the Taliban for harboring former al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden. In 2014, it began to train and advise Afghan security forces, but has gradually pulled troops out in line with a U.S.-brokered peace deal.
 Stoltenberg said that “even with further U.S. reductions, NATO will continue its mission to train, advise and assist the Afghan security forces. We are also committed to funding them through 2024.”

This module reads against the grain of those dominant narratives of colonialism as world-making by focusing on the pirate as an interruptive force, who derails the movement of peoples, goods, ideas, and laws across the maritime routes linking the Atlantic and Indian Ocean worlds. Important tools in the module will be the reading practices of postcolonial theory, which will teach us to extract and assess this alternative history of the post/colonial pirate. The module will also teach students to nuance standard maritime historiographies through literary reading practices, as well as evaluate the metaphoric application of piracy to contemporary, interruptive, economic practices.
