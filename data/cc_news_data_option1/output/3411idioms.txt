The North Arkansas College Board of Trustees has given college president Dr. Randy Esters a green light to research construction of an Advanced Manufacturing Center on the South Campus.
 Esters told board members in a special meeting Thursday morning that a task force had been assembled to study the idea in February. The coronavirus pandemic forced a pause in the plan.
 About two months ago, the group started meeting again to explore the idea, including potential funding.
 Risley and Associates architecture firm was chosen to help with development, Esters said, including choosing a location.
 The task force narrowed a list of potential locations.
 One location was just east of the baseball field, but that would require relocating the field. Moving the field and putting the building in a low-lying area were considered negatives.
 Another site was on the hill where the greenhouse is located, which would require moving it.
 The task force identified a potential location just off Industrial Park Road. That would put the facility in the heart of the industries, but it would likely take up more space than available. It would also put the college in the position of having three distinct campuses again.
 Another potential location was just south of the greenhouse. Construction would require digging into the hill, but there is already ample parking available just east of the site. In addition, both stories of the building would be accessible from ground level.
 Preliminary estimates put the cost of the facility in the range of $6.75 million to $7.35 million.
 Such a facility would house offices, instructional labs, classrooms, computer labs and manufacturing shops for instruction and training. The roughly 30,000 square-foot building would likely house the manufacturing, machining, robotics, electronics and IT programs. All programs except for IT are currently located on the North Campus.
 Esters said the task force’s recommendation was to put the facility in the latter location. It wouldn’t require additional services and it would also be in line with the long-term strategic goal of moving all functions to one campus.
 Esters played a video for the board that displayed the kind of jobs the future will hold, from programming robotic surgical machines and autonomous vehicles to robots that would lay bricks.
 “This is not pretend,” Esters told trustees. “This is not ‘The Jetsons.’ This is some things that are already in place.”
 After the video, Esters told the board that industry is heading in the direction of automation.
 “We’re training folks for jobs that are here today,” he said, “when we need to be training folks for jobs that’ll be here in two years.”
 He went on to say that the college has no intention of abandoning the current programs, but they want to be on the leading edge of technology.
 Esters asked the board for guidance to continue researching the project, including identifying funding sources, and to approve a location. He said the college has about $1.5 million that could go toward the project, and grants were being explored.
 Trustee Scott Miller asked Esters what such a facility could mean for the college’s offerings of programs on a regional level.
 “If we could get this built the way we want to build it, it would put us in the front of automation, and in the front of marrying the IT and the manufacturing world,” Esters said. “I don’t think any other college is doing that.
 “What we’re saying is, if we could get this building started, it puts us in a great position to be the center of excellence in the automation and manufacturing arena before anybody else.”
 Trustee Bill Lovell said most people in the local business world agree that the area needs jobs, for industry to settle in Boone County.
 “To me,” Lovell said, “this is going to put us in the forefront and would be a major attractant to business to relocate here; that our college being such a big part of this community would help train and have people ready, already on the front side, to take on these new jobs.”
 Trustee Chris McNew said on-campus housing would be a major part of following the path described.
 Esters said the housing project is still in the works. He said most people had assumed that construction costs would go down amid the pandemic as contractors needed more work. However, the exact opposite happened and construction costs have actually spiked.
 So, officials decided to wait for a while to let the spike wear down and hope to move forward sometime after the first of the year.
 The board voted unanimously to allow Esters to move forward with the concept and the construction site as recommended by the task force.

PHOENIX (AP) — A diversity report released Friday on Major League Baseball showed a modest increase in its overall diversity hiring practices, spurred by its improved gender diversity.


  The Institute for Diversity and Ethics and Sport at Central Florida gave MLB an overall score of 80.7, which was a letter grade of B. That's up from a 79.5 in 2019. The grade for racial hiring dropped slightly from 89.4 to an 88.7 for a B-plus while gender hiring increased from 69.6 to 72.7 for a C.


  Richard Lapchick, the institute’s director and lead report author, called baseball's gender hiring improvement a "highlight” of this year's study. At the beginning of the 2020 season, there were 21 women who had on-field coaching or player development positions, which is up from seven in 2018.


  “It wasn’t that long ago that a thought about a woman on the field was not in anyone's consciousness,” Lapchick said. “Having 21 women on the field is a dramatic jump. I think everyone saw that when the NBA started hiring and interviewing women there was a positive public reaction. MLB knew that would be good on the game.”


  The study said one of the sport's biggest diversity challenge was that the overwhelming portion of majority owners — 39 of 40 — were white. The one who is not is Arturo Morales of the Los Angeles Angels. He's the only Latino majority owner in American professional sports.


  This final grades were calculated slightly differently this year. For the first time, the grade included hiring practices for team CEO/presidents and team vice presidents, which hurts MLB's final score. Lapchick said that would be the case for most every American sport.

Sending a child to college is an emotional process, helping young adults move into their college dorm can add stress and excitement. Locally, students are returning to their dorm rooms at Navarro College, in Corsicana, Texas.


  Young men and women are catching up with old friends and meeting new ones, while they organize and decorate their rooms. Dorm life is an important component of the college experience. Living close together provides opportunities to learn important life skills including effective techniques for conflict resolution. Having roommates can be difficult, but take it from me, they aren’t always wrong.


  Pictures of young people, ready to begin their next chapter, brought back fond memories of my first move-in day at Southern Illinois University, Carbondale.


  After a 300-mile plus trek, I was ready to get out of the truck. My mother, quickly used her talent for design and flair, transforming a drab room into my temporary home. Before she and my stepdad left, she hugged and kissed me on the cheek, telling me that she was proud of me.


  Most importantly, she encouraged me to see and do things outside of my comfort zone; to certainly not skip class, but also not skip every party. She told me to have the time of my life, but to be smart in the process. Mom surmised, that was the point of college.

  Finau said it never crossed his mind not to play Thursday, but he appreciated “the magnitude of what the NBA was doing and what they were boycotting for, and I know the PGA TOUR is in full support of that.”


  “It’s a conversation that’s uncomfortable, sensitive for our country,” Finau said. “But if we’re not willing to have those, I don’t think we can move forward as a country. I’m open to having a conversation with anybody on the issue, and again, I think we’re in full support of what the NBA has done.”


  Finau said it was important for the tour to play because of charity it provides to communities, including programs that reach inner-city youth and the underprivileged.


  “So to take that away I think is a big deal for us,” he said, “and that's why I think we continue to play.”

After years in limbo, _The New Mutants_ hits theaters today, hoping to be one of the highest-profile releases of the summer movie season so far (with a number of other recent films, including this week's _Bill and Ted Face the Music_ , effectively blackballed by major theater chains for doing a day-and- date digital release for the fans in states with no open theaters). The movie, which is loosely adapted from the original (read: pre-Liefeld) run of the comic by the same name, centers on a group of young mutants who are discovering their powers in a more frightening and traumatizing way than fans are used to seeing in an X-Men movie.
 Among the relationships that the film gets to explore is the "bromance" between Sunspot and Cannonball, a pair of characters who are well known to comic book fans but significantly less familiar (at least until now) with the moviegoing audience.
 "Sunspot has a bromance, man, he and Sam are really tight," actor Henry Zaga told Comic Book Movie. "They're incredibly different, but they know each other on a deeper level, I think that Sam knows that Roberto comes from a good place, even when he's being a dick. He doesn't want to be a dick, he's traumatized too, and there's so much more to him than the surface-level, jokester front he puts up."
 "He's a guy that really just needs a friend and I think Sam does that really well," Zaga continued. "He's a great friend to Roberto. There's a line that I love in the movie that when Sam gives me the go, he goes 'Nut up 'Berto!,' and it's finally when you see me become Sunspot. That was one of the most rewarding relationships for me to play, outside of growing even closer to Josh, Charlie and I have become such great friends, he's a wonderful actor and person, and it was like Sam and Roberto's relationship bleeding into real life."

 The film, which was originally slated to be released in 2018, has been rescheduled numerous times even before the coronavirus pandemic shut down theaters in March. Since then, it got bumped a little more, but Disney seemed finally set on actually getting the film out in cinemas.

The film is now in theaters, with no word yet on when it will hit home video and reports suggesting that it might get one of the more traditional release windows of 2020, meaning about a 3-month wait for those who can't or won't go to cinema.

NEW YORK (AP) — Naomi Osaka overcame a faulty serve and reached the finals of the Western & Southern Open on Friday following a one-day break in the tournament prompted by her call for racial justice.


  Osaka, the only Top 10 player left in the women's bracket, sparked the break by announcing she would drop out of the tournament rather than play a semifinal match against Elise Mertens. Osaka chose to keep playing after the unified one-day show of support.


  How would she handle the emotions of the last few days? She was up to the moment.


  She struggled with her serve — her toss was repeatedly off the mark — but gritted out a 6-2, 7-6 (5) victory to reach her first Western & Southern title match.


  Osaka's tweet on Wednesday night that as a Black woman she's exhausted and “sick to my stomach” over the many Black people killed by police drew quick support from other players and resulted in tennis joining other sports in calling off play temporarily. Osaka didn't practice on the off day.


  Osaka, a two-time Grand Slam champion, held serve to open her match against against 14th-seeded Mertens, and then broke for a 2-0 lead that set the tone. Osaka surged ahead 5-1.

The rising popularity of minimal-invasive procedures and the cost-effectiveness of non-surgical procedures is driving the adoption ofÂ non-surgical cosmeticÂ procedures across the globe. Technavioâ€™s research analysis on the global hyaluronic acid market identifies that this increased adoption of non-surgical cosmetic procedures will be one of the major factors that will have a positive impact on the marketâ€™s growth during the next few years. Dermal fillers,Â chemical peels, laser treatments, microdermabrasion, and botulinum toxin are some of the major non-surgical procedures. Hyaluronic acid (HA), calcium hydroxylapatite, polyalkylimide, polylactic acid, and polymethyl-methacrylate microspheres are the major types of dermal fillers. Hyaluronic acid injection helps in the reduction of damage caused by scars, wounds, or lines. It is also used to improve the contour of the skin. This will consequently increase the demand for hyaluronic acid for cosmetic procedures, fueling market growth.Â

NOVA IGUAÇU - Um homem foi morto a tiros dentro de um carro na manhã desta sexta-feira (28 de agosto), em Nova Iguaçu, na Baixada Fluminense...


--DocBreak--
It has long been accepted, at least in some circles, that there is a condition known as Trump Derangement Syndrome. But if there are still any skeptics out there, consider the reaction to first lady Melania Trump's renovation of the White House Rose Garden.


   


  The modern version of the garden was created during the Kennedy administration and updated during the first year of the Reagan administration. It was a living thing, something intended to grow and change.


   


  In 1981, first lady Nancy Reagan asked the godmother of the garden, philanthropist Bunny Mellon, who created the original design for Jacqueline Kennedy, "to return to the White House and re-energize the planting that had become lackluster over the preceding 20 years," according to a report by the Committee for the Preservation of the White House. "Mrs. Mellon suggested removing two of the crabapple [trees] in each bed and pruning them back into shape ... along with new plantings of lilies and roses." In other words, Mellon did not view the garden as an unchangeable monument.


   


  That was 40 years ago. In that time, parts of the garden have grown out of their original proportions, while use of the garden for events, from news conferences to parties, has increased. Working with Mrs. Trump, the Committee for the Preservation of the White House conducted a study and produced a 200-page report on the state of the garden. Among other things, they found some of the infrastructure of the garden was a mess. "Loose and exposed wires were found everywhere and connected using electrical tape," the report said.


   


  Infrastructure improvements, and much more, were part of the first lady's update of the garden. "The changes you see are the result of a thoughtful and collaborative process carefully crafted with the help of scholars and experts in architecture, horticulture, design and historic preservation," Mrs. Trump said at an event christening the garden on a recent Saturday. "This renewal included improvements to the infrastructure and utilities, allowing this beautiful garden to more readily meet the needs of a busy White House. These improvements also make the garden fully accessible to all Americans, including those with disabilities." (As for power cables and wiring, they are hidden beneath a newly installed path of limestone pavers.)


   


  So what's the problem? When the garden improvements were announced, you might have thought the first lady had created the set for a new Nuremberg rally. "The Trump family did its best to turn the lovely Rose Garden into a neo- fascist parade ground," tweeted longtime Washington journalist Howard Fineman.


   


  A former New York Times reporter, Kurt Eichenwald, who has been the source of much erratic commentary in the Trump era, targeted Melania Trump's background. (Born in Slovenia, the first lady came to the United States 24 years ago and became a naturalized U.S. citizen 14 years ago, in 2006.) "It is a destruction of our history, something no other first lady had the gall to do," Eichenwald tweeted. "This is the first time I have been furious that @FLOTUS is a foreigner. She has no right to wreck our history." Eichenwald took some hits on Twitter for his xenophobia and later deleted his tweet.


   


  Critics posted photos of the old Rose Garden in full bloom in spring alongside the newly redesigned garden with the normal fewer blooms in August. And then political Twitter pounced. "Devoid of color, they somehow brought a white supremacy vibe to the #RoseGarden," said one tweet. "The Trumps are all Satan," said another. "You took away all of the colors and turned Jackie Kennedy's beautiful Rose Garden into a funeral home for white supremacists," said another. "She was going for that 'Nuremberg rally grounds' look," said yet another. "I seriously hate the Demon and his wife," said one more. "Look at what they ruined. I can't wait until Jill Biden is first lady and brings back the #RoseGarden full of flowers, trees and nothing but sheer vibrance."


   


  The short version: In a matter of hours, the Rose Garden had become just another battleground in the Trump wars, like the post office but even sillier. The first lady's effort was serious, carefully done and needed. (And, like the original garden, paid for by private funds.) But everything is fair game in today's supercharged political atmosphere. Even flowers.

While the modifications may have improved Sandro's confidence, his rather unconventional appearance made him difficult to find a job and a romantic relationship. He stressed that he should be accepted not for his appearance but for the values he held.
 "My transformation has influenced my life, but I don't care. I should be accepted as a person, and above all because of my inner values. My appearance has had a huge impact on my chances of getting a job because a lot of companies are still very conservative and prefer to go with the flow," he told the British tabloid. "I think that it has of course had an effect on me finding a relationship, as it scares most people off, but of course, many people also find it very interesting."

“It’s a pretty hard course at first, with a 5.5-km climb (Côte de Rimiez) at 5 percent and then it goes on climbing. It’s the Nice hinterland and we know how bumpy it is. Then there is a really steep descent — very technical — and then 20 km on the flat,” said Marino. “We can expect a big battle in the climbs. The big question is whether a sprinter can survive or whether a breakaway can go all the way. We noticed in the past that if we made too hard a course, it was always the same [women] who won. This time, it might not be the strongest who wins, but certainly the most clever,” he added.

The two pleaded guilty in June to keeping food from John’s children, ages 11 and 13, as well as forcing them to stand in a corner for up to eight hours as punishment for “childlike behavior,” the report says.
 “It’s a difficult case for the court to comprehend, the level of abuse is disturbing to say the least,” said Taylor. “Parents have different views on how to raise children and I don’t think there’s any one way… But there is a line and I think it’s a rather bright line that should not be crossed.”
 The abuse was instigated by Joanna, the children’s stepmother, after she moved into the family home years ago. John, meanwhile, did nothing to stop or prevent the ongoing abuse, the report says.

Soon I met Steve, a goth kid who hailed from the Chicago area. At first, I wasn’t sure how his personality would mesh with my small-town country sensibilities. After some conversation and laughs, however, we found that common ground which extended beyond the width of the state. An irreverent jokester, he quickly became one of my best friends. We had each other’s back’s while traveling on and off campus to diners and infamous house party spots.


  He never left me or anyone else behind. A creed continued when he exchanged his goth garb for Army Green. I’m proud of my buddy, not only for the decision he made, instead because of the man he is. It’s been years since we left that college town, now telephone calls have replaced late night runs to the dining hall, but I’m still privileged for the opportunity to share occasional meals and his sense of humor with his wife and child.


  The Thompson Point dorms and Southern Illinois University in Carbondale, are special places. Not because of amenities, but because of the great people who taught us, including those who lived with us.


  Video and board games, tossing a football between and after class and taking a study break to catch a game at the SIU Arena, added depth to the course work covered in the classrooms. Help with homework and other resources were at our disposal, all we had to do was ask.


  Today’s college students face challenges we couldn’t have imagined back then, but try not to worry Bulldog’s. Be safe and smart, and enjoy the entire experience. Support and opportunity are available at countless points along the way.

  Champ was among the few players who were under par midway through the opening round of the BMW Championship until his round got away from him. He had two double bogeys on the front nine for a 42 that put him in danger of missing out on the Tour Championship next week.


  That's just golf. Champ is pushing a broader picture.


  He had a gallery Thursday at an event with no specators, including PGA Tour Commissioner Jay Monahan for the last few holes of his opening nine holes. Monahan walked with Tim Rittenhouse, head of sponsorships and sports marketing for BMW North America, lagging behind.


  Monahan was tracing developments Wednesday night when the NBA did not play three playoff games, and other sports soon followed. Postponing the BMW Championship, even for a day, did not appear to be part of the conversation. He spoke of programs that reach the less privileged and are supported by tournaments like the BMW Championship.


  Asked about not playing, Champ said he thought about it but that “I feel like I can do a lot more playing, and again, showing my support and expressing myself.”


  Woods said he was in touch with Monahan on whether to play and “all the guys were on board.”

Every day individuals put their own well-being on the back burner to take care of work responsibilities, families and day-to-day activities. It is important, however, to also practice self-care, according to Teresa Henson, Extension specialist - nutrition outreach coordinator at the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff.


   


  August is National Wellness Month. It is a time to think about self-first and to take care of one's mental, spiritual and physical needs to stay healthy, according to a news release.


   


  In honor of Wellness Month, Henson suggests people consider the following recommendations for a better self.


   


  "These recommendations can be the start to a new and healthier you for months and years to come," according to the release.


   


  DRINK MORE WATER. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Choose MyPlate suggests people cut calories by drinking water. Soda, energy drinks and sports drinks are a major source of added sugar and calories. Make fun ice cubes from 100% juice or add slices of fruit to make water more exciting.


   


  BUILD A HEALTHY PLATE. The USDA Choose MyPlate recommends people incorporate healthy foods from all food groups. Incorporating a variety of nutritious foods in the diet will provide people with the necessary nutrients, minerals and vitamins to be healthy.


   


  INCREASE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY. Exercise is important for one's health. Individuals who are active are less likely to develop certain chronic diseases than adults who are inactive. Try something new. Sign up for a class to learn how to salsa dance, surf, do tai chi or play a sport.


   


  GET MORE SLEEP. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says that a third of adults in the United States get less than the recommended amount of sleep. Not getting enough sleep may increase one's risk for obesity, high blood pressure, stroke or poor mental health. Getting enough sleep is good for one's health. According to the Mayo Clinic, adults need seven to nine hours of sleep nightly.


   


  PRACTICE MEDITATION. Stressors of life's responsibilities can hinder one's health. Adding meditation to one's day can help calm the mind and spirit. Meditating for a few minutes can reduce stress and anxiety and promote emotional health.


   


  THINK POSITIVE THOUGHTS. Positive thinking can benefit one's mental health. People should take time to control their thought process. Thinking positive can provide such health benefits as lower levels of distress, better coping skills in stressful times, lower rates of depression and increased quality of life. "Steer away from negative thinking if possible. Incorporate meditation, which is a great way to make you aware of your thoughts and feelings. Meditation can help channel positive thoughts instead of negative ones," according to the release.


   


  PAMPER YOURSELF. Making time to get pampered is a great way to recharge and rejuvenate and is a necessary part of staying healthy both physically and mentally. Taking a "me" day can improve one's overall health in many ways. "For example, pampering yourself can help release stress, helps you to refocus and improves happiness," according to the release.


   


  "Jump start your wellness journey with these recommendations to make health your priority," Henson said.

Federal prosecutor Lucinda Woolery wrote in a court memo filed Aug. 21 that Sherry Paulo was a “controlling matriarch” and the family followed her orders in the family and at work.


  Paulo withheld medications from DeBrodie beginning in 2015 and did not take him to a doctor from December 2015 until his death, Woolery wrote. She moved him to her home in September 2016 because his condition was so bad “he would lie in bed howling,” according to the memo.


  DeBrodie spent his last days in a small basement room with no access to running water, sunlight, or fresh air, according to the memo.


  Paulo and her husband each told police that they eventually asked DeBrodie’s housemate to carry him to an upstairs bathroom and place him under running water. Paulo said she watched DeBrodie stop breathing but neither she nor her husband provided medical aid or called for help, according to memo.


  Instead, DeBrodie was left in the bathtub until the smell grew too strong.


  In her plea agreement, Mary Paulo admitted to helping Sherry Paulo place DeBrodie into a trash can, which was loaded into a wooden crate and filled with concrete. Sherry Paulo, her husband and their son, Anthony R.K. Flores, took the crate to a storage unit, Anthony R.K. Flores admitted in his plea agreement.

The Ozark Mountain Solid Waste District is looking at ways to better manage the used tire collection site in Harrison because the tire recycling program is currently financially strained.
 The solid waste board met Tuesday morning in Harrison and interim district director Bill Lord addressed problems he sees with programs in the district.
 The district contracts with Champlin Tire Recycling to take used tires across the district. The Arkansas Department of Environmental Quality is supposed to reimburse the district for removal of those tires.
 “The waste tire program is losing money,” said Luke Feighert, Harrison chief financial officer who also handles finance for the district. “ADEQ doesn’t even reimburse us enough to pick up the tires here.”
 Feighert said ADEQ has reported there are companies who pick up waste tires for other districts at $1.80 per tire. Ozark Mountain is paying about $2.60 per tire without administration costs. He said Lord is researching other companies that might work out for the district.
 Lord said that, in his assessment, the waste tire program has been “neglected.” He explained that as a rule of thumb, a district should collect an amount of tires each year roughly equal to the population of the entire district. Last year, the district collected about 36,000 more tires than would be normal.
 Part of that could be security. While some drop off sites are behind a fence or otherwise secured, the one in Harrison is beside Hudson Tire and Battery and is accessible all the time. That means people can go to the site all hours of the day and night and dump tires. They aren’t registered with state authorities and the source of those tires is something of a mystery.
 Lord said the district is proposing to educate tire retailers, who pay fees when they sell tires in order to finance the waste tire program, and collection centers about what’s needed to tighten up the system.
 Another recommendation is to install fencing and security cameras at the collection center in Harrison, along with signage explaining requirements for dropping off tires. He said people might be more cautious if they understand they are being recorded dropping off tires in the middle of the night.
 “So,” Lord said, “we’re going to do what we can to try to stop that.”

However, the claims are pretty much entirely speculation. The closest interaction between the president and the former royal couple is that President Trump has mentioned that the United States wouldn't pay for any security for Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, and the couple in turn released a statement indicating that they'd pay for it themselves. That's the extent of the alleged feud between Prince Harry and Trump — despite the rumor's serious implications, there's no basis in reality. There's also the fact that Prince Harry is, after all, a wealthy royal with high-power connections, and it'd be nothing short of shocking to find out that the couple didn't have their immigration papers in order.

The last couple of songs mark a return to the earnest, writ large, and not necessarily to the album's benefit, though you can't blame the then-mom-to-be for wanting to stick a mature landing. "Only Love" gets gospelly as Perry considers the time left and specifically name-checking mom and dad as folks to check in with before it's too late -- but "big picture" reads as "big production" in the execution by John DeBold, to the tune's detriment. Things are actually kept pretty intimate on the largely acoustic closer, "What Makes a Woman," but here the self-celebrating-of-the-sisterhood lyrics that let her down.
