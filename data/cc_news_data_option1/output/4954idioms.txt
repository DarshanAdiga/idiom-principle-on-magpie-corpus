There's a lot of pressure. There's a lot of lights and cameras, and your heart is racing, but it's a really great community. The people there are so beyond welcoming," she said.Williams said she hopes her modeling career will shine a light on teenage mental health issues and social justice."I've already learned that modeling is really hard work. It's also exciting, and I want to use this opportunity and exposure to help other people," she said in a written statement.Whizdom Williams says she wants to use her words to break down barriers in the beauty industry.The socially active 6-foot-1 teen said she encourages her peers to participate in issues of equality."I am a very happy person, but I have struggled emotionally at times," Williams said. "I want to give teens a safe place to seek help and ask adults to give it to us -- without judgment."The accomplished teen is also a competitive gymnast, plays high school basketball, knows sign language and has a passion for poetry.The Ford modeling agency has represented several household names like Naomi Campbell, Christie Brinkley, Brooke Shields and Christy Turlington.Williams also plays high school basketball and has a passion for poetry."I do also understand that there are very unrealistic beauty standards for African American women and people of color in America," Williams said.She plans to use her words to break down barriers in the beauty industry."I think that it's so important to let the woman within the modeling industry know that they are more than a face, they are more than a body and that they have a voice and every right to speak out and let their voices be heard," Williams said.Scripps Only Content 2020

In Miles' first appearance in the comics, he initially rejects the call to adventure after realizing a spider gave him powers in "Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man" in 2011. He is afraid to be thought of as a mutant, and decides to leave the superheroics to the other Spider-Man. The problem is that, shortly afterwards, Peter gets shot, and Miles becomes guilt-ridden over the thought that he could have helped had he just embraced his role earlier. This means that Peter is actually Miles' Uncle Ben in this universe, and the reason he decides to don the costume and go out to help people, only meeting Peter when he accidentally travels from another dimension, where the two get a bit of a mentor-mentee relationship on and off over the years.

DOAN: That’s a great question. I never thought of it like that. With what happened and what Mai Ling chose to do to him, I don’t think their storylines are parallel because, even though she’s reaching out and making it possible that they can reunite, whether or not they do, the only time that they’re really on the same page is in the fight against San Francisco and protecting our people and our Chinatown. That’s really the one thing that they have in common.

DOAN: It was such a whirlwind. We were shooting Season 2 of _Warrior_ in Cape Town and I remember getting that audition very near the end of the season. I dragged Joe Taslim into a green room to help me tape it, and then I booked it that day. On my last day of shooting, I booked it, I was on a plane two days later, I landed in L.A. and went straight to a fitting, and then I shot the next day. It was just a whirlwind. The crazier part, on top of that, was that I didn’t really know what to expect going into it. It was a great character on paper, but I didn’t know that I was gonna have superpowers. It wasn’t really clear, because it was all in the past, if I was ever gonna meet Chloe [Bennet] or what being sisters meant. It was a two and a half month whirlwind for me. Everyone on that show was so welcoming and are dear friends, to this day. It was such a lovely experience.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin urged Congress to approve COVID-19 relief funds without further delay, though Democrats continued to attack a decision by Mnuchin to allow five Fed lending programs to expire during the pandemic.In his most direct comments so far, Powell told the House Financial Services Committee on Wednesday that it’s “very important” for Congress to provide economic support.New funding would serve as a “bridge” for the economy to get from the current environment in which virus infections are spiking, to next year when vaccines should be widely available, Powell said.“We are trying to get as many people across that bridge as we can,” Powell said.Without more assistance, Powell said, people will lose their homes and small businesses will fail. “You could lose parts of the economy,” which would slow any recovery next year, he said.“We are hearing from all over that small businesses are really under pressure,” Powell told lawmakers.For a second day a number of Democratic lawmakers on the committee challenged Mnuchin’s decision to allow five Fed lending programs to expire at the end of this year, contending that his reading of the law was incorrect. They say it’s a political maneuver to hobble the incoming Biden administration financially.“There is no justifiable reason for taking these tools away,” Rep. Maxine Waters, chair of the House panel, told Mnuchin. “It is foolish and reckless.”In a rare split with Treasury last month, the Fed issued a statement saying that it believed it was important to continue providing an economic backstop after Mnuchin said he was terminating the programs.Mnuchin has repeatedly insisted that he was just following the CARES Act law.When Powell was asked if he agreed with that interpretation, Powell deferred to Mnuchin.Powell did say Wednesday that the Fed had issued its statement to make it clear that the central bank was committed to providing further support to the economy.“We were concerned that the public might misinterpret (Mnuchin’s action) as the Fed stepping back and thinking our work is done,” Powell said.Asked what Congress should put in a relief bill that could pass in the lame-duck session this month, Mnuchin said his priority would be an authorization allowing the Treasury to use $140 billion in left-over funds to provide small businesses with a second round of Paycheck Protection Program loans.The PPP program allowed businesses to get loans to keep their workers on the payroll with the loan forgiven if the business met certain terms geared at avoiding layoffs.Mnuchin said Congress should also consider extending some of the emergency unemployment benefit programs that are being used by around 11 million workers. Those programs will expire at the end of this month without Congressional action.Lawmakers have been unable to reach agreement on further economic relief after many programs in the $2 trillion CARE Act expired in August. Democrats are seeking more funds than the GOP-controlled Senate has been willing to provide.On Tuesday a bipartisan group of senators introduced a aid bill totaling around $908 billion, raising hopes that the legislative impasse might be broken. Mnuchin said he was in discussions with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who since this summer has insisted on a larger bill. Mnuchin said unfortunately Pelosi has insisted that a half-a-loaf measure would not be good enough.“I would encourage Congress in the lame duck,” Mnuchin said. “Let’s get something done.”He said has been keeping President Donald Trump abreast of the negotiations every day.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.
