We love VanMoof's electric bicycles, but they're hardly an impulse purchase. The Electrified S2 and X2, for instance, launched with a $2,598 price-tag two years ago -- and that was with an $800 early-bird discount. For its third-gen lineup, then, it's no surprise that the company has chosen refinement and affordability over expensive innovations. The new S3 and X3 will cost $1,998 which, while undeniably expensive, is the cheapest e-bike range that VanMoof has ever put together. It's technically an "introduction price," but one that shouldn't change unless COVID-19 has a massive impact on the business. "We're launching at this price and we intend to keep [the] S3 and X3 at this price," a spokesperson told Engadget.From afar, the S3 and X3 look the same as their stylish predecessors. The S3 has a conventional frame shape and 28-inch wheels that are designed for riders between 175cm and 210cm tall. The X3, meanwhile, has a head-turning 'cross' frame and 24-inch wheels that suit a slightly smaller cyclist. The city- centric frame also has a small space on the front with stretchy straps for stowing a bag or small parcel. In the past, VanMoof has sold a basket accessory that clips onto this part of the frame, making it even easier to transport grocery bags and other precarious items. Don't be fooled by the familiar silhouettes, though. "Under the hood, everything is different," Job Stehmann, chief product designer at VanMoof told Engadget. "I think 90 percent of the parts are different." VanMoof Like the S2 and X2, the new models have a 250-500W motor that can help you reach 25 KMH (15.5MPH) in Europe and 32 KMH (20MPH) in the US -- the maximum allowed by each region's lawmakers at the moment. It's now "near-silent" at top speed, though, and the housing is "sleeker and more compact" than the version that shipped in the previous bikes.The motor might be similar, but the ride and performance should be dramatically different. VanMoof's new S3 and X3 bikes have four gears -- double what their predecessors had -- that should make it easier to ride around town without breaking a sweat. "This is the sweet spot that gets you, in a city environment, up and down a hill," Stehmann said, "while still keeping a system that doesn't shift so often that it annoys you like hell." All VanMoof bicycles have automatic and electronic gear shifting, which can now be fine-tuned through a companion app. The always-satisfying Boost button makes a return, too, with "extra on-demand power" for overtaking other cyclists, conquering slopes and accelerating away from traffic lights."The people who rode an [Electrified] S and S2, if they ride this bike, they will feel an enormous shift in performance," Stehmann said.The S3 and X3 ship with a 504Wh battery -- the same as their second-gen predecessors -- that can take you up to 150KM (93 miles) on a single charge. Your experience will depend on the mode you're riding in -- higher levels of assist will drain the battery faster -- and the terrain you're often tackling. VanMoof VanMoof's much-hyped safety features are making a return, too. The S3 and X3 have a Kick Lock button on the rear hub which, once nudged, immobilises the back wheel and activates an escalating alarm system. You can then unlock the bike through the companion app, Bluetooth proximity, or by tapping a short code with the left- side button on the handlebars. In theory, the rear-hub lock and attention- grabbing alarm should deter most would-be thieves. It's not a perfect system, though, as someone could carefully lift the bike into a truck and drive away before you have time to react. If that happens, the frame's built-in location tracking will kick in. You can retrieve it solo or, via VanMoof's Peace of Mind subscription service, pay for some professional 'bike hunters' to go on your behalf. If the retrieval squad doesn't succeed within two weeks, VanMoof will give you a replacement. At the time of writing, a three-year subscription costs $290, with a $98 replacement fee if your bike is stolen a second or third time. After that, you're basically on your own and will need to pay full-price.Like the S2 and X2, the bike has a weather-proof Matrix Display embedded in the frame's top tube. Comprising 166 LEDs, it can show your bike's charge level, speed, gear and motor-assisted power level, a skull when the alarm is triggered, and numerous animations that indicate when it's woken up, powering down and charging. The speaker has also been improved, according to VanMoof, so you can hear better on windy days.The S3 and X3 contain a bunch of other small but welcome changes. Both bikes have hydraulic disc brakes, rather than mechanical, and 'invisible' cables that run through the handlebars. The integrated lights have been tweaked, too, and a future software update will let you pick between 'beam' and 'halo' illumination. The fender flaps are a little more ergonomic, the matte frames have a better scratch-resistant finish, and the included charger is smaller than before. VanMoof has even overhauled the unpacking experience so that it's less wasteful and easier to understand. Job Stehmann, chief product designer at VanMoof "Every little detail, we did try to improve," Stehmann said. "But of course, the things that were already good, we didn't change radically."VanMoof hasn't made any drastic changes to its e-bike formula. You can't remove the battery, for instance, and charge it separately like many other e-bikes. The S3 and X3 don't fold, either, or charge your laptop and phone.The reduced price, though, keeps VanMoof competitive with other design-centric e-bikes such as the Cowboy, Coboc One, and anything by Riese & Muller. Stehmann said the company has achieved this cost saving by designing its own parts and, where possible, streamlining its manufacturing and assembly process. "We've worked for 10 years to ramp up and change the supply chain we had in place, to be independent from the bike industry," he explained. The team is also building more bikes -- and by extension, buying more parts -- which creates volume- based cost savings. "The biggest impact in price is the quantity," he added. "The quantity went up a lot, and that has a massive influence in electronics."That streamlining extends to VanMoof's broader product portfolio. Two years ago, the company sold the S2 and X2 without a battery (hence why the motorized versions were branded Electrified S2 and X2). The third-generation will have no such option, though. "For me it was like a funeral," Stehmann said. "Burying the smart bike. It was such a great bike and we learned a lot from it." To survive and grow, though, VanMoof needs to specialize. "We have to stick to our mission," the designer added. "If we want to change the way we move in cities then we do need to focus." VanMoof The company appears to be searching for its Tesla Model 3 moment -- a combination of price and quality that will turn VanMoof's e-bike into a mainstream success. Stehmann believes $2,500 is the "sweet spot" which, now that they've beaten, will radically change their sales. "We know you attract a different kind of person when you go under that price," he said. "And that's also the goal. Our goal is to get as many people on bikes as we can. The product, we can easily double the price and still make good business out of that, I think. Of course you will sell less, but it doesn't matter. But we're not in it for that game. We're in it to change it for good. And that means we need to step in radically with the price as well."Is $1,998 low enough to trigger such a phenomenon? I'm not sure, but it's the closest the company has come to building an e-bike for the masses.

The uptick was further supported by mostly in line UK consumer inflation figures for March.

One of the only marquee sports events scheduled for the spring not to be canceled or postponed because of the coronavirus pandemic gets underway Thursday night in the NFL Draft.
   
 The in-person ceremonies scheduled to take place on the Las Vegas Strip have been changed to a virtual draft, with league commissioner Roger Goodell announcing selections from his home in New York.
   
 Thursday night features the first 32 picks, with rounds two and three slated for Friday night. The final four rounds are set for Saturday.
   
 Several Missouri football alumni have the chance to be selected, with defensive tackle Jordan Elliott and tight end Albert Okwuegbunam the most likely to be drafted.
   
 "Elliott is probably the guy that's going to go the highest," said Nate Davis, NFL reporter for USA TODAY, of the Missouri prospects. "I would assume sometime on Friday, maybe (mid-second round, early third round). He's not the flashiest guy, maybe not the most productive guy on a box score, but a lot of these teams run a 3-4 defense.
   
 "He's the type of guy that can tie up blocks for you and maybe clean up a quarterback on sacks when the pressure gets there. I'm not sure he can be a main guy to do that. I think he can be a solid starter in the league. ... He's one of those dirty work kind of guys."
   
 Elliott played in all 12 of Missouri's games in 2019 and posted 44 tackles, 10 tackles for loss and three sacks. The 6-foot-4, 315-pounder draws comparisons to Pittsburgh Steelers defensive lineman and former Notre Dame standout Stephon Tuitt.
   
 According to Davis, Elliott is a more-known commodity than Okwuegbunam in terms of NFL potential.
   
 "He's a real boom or bust guy," Davis said of Okwuegbunam. "... I've heard some people that really like his potential a lot. I know a lot of other people don't really think he's much of a prospect.
   
 "He's really good at beating up on Memphis and Vanderbilt, but you don't see him show up in a lot of other games. I know he's kind of raw, too. It only takes one team to fall in love with him. I can't imagine he's going to go before Saturday, but I'm sure somebody is going to take a flyer on him somewhere in there."
   
 Concerns over Okwuegbunam also come from his abilities in fundamentals such as blocking, Davis said.
   
 That's compared to receiving and running, where Okwuegbunam is among the elite in this draft class. He ran the fastest 40-yard dash time of any tight end at the 2020 NFL Combine in 4.49 seconds. In 2017, his last season without injury for MU, he caught 11 touchdown passes.
   
 In 2019, Okwuegbunam played in 11 games but started only nine. He did lead the Tigers with six touchdown receptions.
   
 Davis believes Okwuegbunam would best fit on a team such as the Baltimore Ravens because of how their offense has traditionally used tight ends.
   
 With reigning MVP Lamar Jackson behind center and Joe Flacco before him, Baltimore has used multiple tight-end sets, allowing for one-on-one coverage and time for tight ends such as Mark Andrews and Nick Boyle to develop.
   
 Davis' comparison for Okwuegbunam is Washington Redskins tight end Richard Rodgers, who also recently played for the Green Bay Packers.
   
 The identity of the third MU player drafted this weekend, or whether the Tigers get more than Elliott and Okwuegbunam, isn't clear.
   
 Davis' choice is cornerback DeMarkus Acy because of the number of teams that have a need in the secondary. At 6-foot-2, 195 pounds, Acy has the preferred size for an NFL cornerback, Davis said.
   
 Acy missed the final two games of the 2019 season because of a hamstring injury.
   
 Former MU quarterback Kelly Bryant told the Tribune last month that no teams asked him about switching positions during the NFL Combine. Davis believes Bryant most likely will go undrafted but is nearly a lock for a team to bring him into training camp to compete for a roster spot.
   
 Of Missouri's three offensive linemen taking part in the NFL Draft process, Davis said Trystan Colon-Castillo is the most relevant name among NFL teams, despite an 11-rep showing on the bench press at the NFL Combine.
   
 Colon-Castillo, Missouri's previous starter at center, was injured while training for the event but played in every game last season for the Tigers before deciding to forgo his final year of college eligibility for the draft.
   
 Fellow offensive linemen Yasir Durant and Tre'Vour Wallace-Simms also hope to hear their names called this weekend. Durant was invited to the NFL Combine, while Wallace-Simms was not.
   
 Another possible late-round draft pick would be former Missouri linebacker Cale Garrett, who was having an All-American-type season before tearing his pectoral muscle against Troy last October, ending his MU career.
   
 In five games, Garrett recorded 43 tackles, five tackles for loss, three interceptions, two sacks and three defensive touchdowns.
   
 Davis said the fact that many NFL teams are moving to a two-linebacker system hurts Garrett's chances to stay on the field, as his combine 40-yard dash time (4.92 seconds) was the slowest among linebackers timed.
   
 However, Garrett's speed never appeared to be an issue for making plays all over the field for Missouri. Garrett should at least get a training camp invite.
   
 Former Missouri wide receiver Johnathon Johnson and kicker Tucker McCann also didn't partake in the combine but have been training on their own for a chance at a professional career.

The British pound turned out to be one of the worst-performing currencies on Tuesday. Sustained USD buying kept exerting pressure and dragged GBP/USD to two-week lows. Wednesday's in line UK consumer inflation figures lifted the pair back above 1.2300 mark. The British pound turned out to be the worst-performing currencies on Tuesday and prompted some aggressive selling around the GBP/USD pair. Risk aversion remained a dominant theme in the market amid a free-fall in crude oil prices, which provided an additional boost to the already stronger US dollar and turned out to be one of the key factors exerting pressure on the major. Tuesday's mixed UK employment details did little to impress bullish traders, instead prospect of an extended lockdown in the UK took its toll on the sterling. The pair nosedived to two-week lows, albeit managed to find some support near mid-1.2200s and finally settled around 45 pips off daily lows. The pair now seems to have stabilized near the 1.2300 round-figure mark and traded with a mild positive bias during the Asian session on Wednesday. The uptick was further supported by mostly in line UK consumer inflation figures for March. However, the ever-increasing coronavirus cases and related death in the United Kingdom should keep a lid on any attempted recovery for the major. This comes amid expectations that the world economy will remain weak for some time, even once the lockdowns are eased. This should continue underpinning the greenback's status as the global reserve currency and might further contribute towards capping gains. In the absence of any major market-moving economic releases from the US, developments surrounding the coronavirus saga might continue to play a key role in influencing the broader market risk sentiment and produce some meaningful trading opportunities. Short-term technical outlook From a technical perspective, the pair on Tuesday broke through a near one-week-old trading range and thus, remains vulnerable to continue with its bearish trajectory. However, the 1.2250-45 region might continue to act as immediate support, below which the pair is likely to accelerate the fall further towards challenging the 1.2200 round-figure mark before eventually dropping to monthly lows support, near the 1.2165 region. On the flip side, immediate resistance is pegged near the 1.2355-60 region, above which a bout of short-covering has the potential to lift the pair further towards reclaiming the 1.2400 round- figure mark. The momentum could further get extended towards the next major resistance near the 1.2460-65 region. Some follow-through buying should assist the pair to aim back towards the key 1.2500 psychological mark.

1. Not being alone during this quarantine. In fact, being with someone who loves me as much as I love them.   2. Both my parents being alive. I know I can't see them - but we can do a video call whenever we want. They are STILL HERE.   3. Food. I am grateful for food. On days I'm bored, it's rice and lobiya. On days I'm feeling like trying something new, it can be atte ka halwa and cucumber chickpea salad with beer or whiskey. I'm grateful that I'm not starving. I'm grateful that I have the opportunity to explore my relationship with food and cooking.   4. Air-conditioning. ( I'll forever be grateful for this during the Indian Summers ).   5. WiFi.   6. Instagram and Twitter and Facebook and YouTube and the millions of people who share their journeys online. I know that I am not alone. I have access to the lives of millions. It is inspiring.   7. Being able to share my own journey and life online. I'm grateful for having my blog, my Instagram channels, my YouTube channel, a podcast! ( there are some people who actually want to listen to me TALK! )   8. Paints. And paint brushes, and an easel and the wooden bases of brooches so that I can experiment new styles. Heck I even have a functioning online shop where I can list my art and some people are STILL buying my art even though I cannot ship it to them right now!   9. Mobile phones. I can talk to literally anyone I want. About whatever I want. I can talk to friends who are halfway across the world. The lockdown has meant that I have reached out to more than a few that I had lost touch with over the last decade.   10. My plants. They give me joy. I like digging around their pots, observing the insects, figuring out what best insecticide I can whip up at home. I like looking at the green every morning. I cannot go out in nature right now ( not that there's a lot of nature around where I live in Gurgaon anyway ) but I can sit on the floor amidst my plant pots and I can talk to them.   11. Sleep. I can sleep. I am being able to sleep. The older I get, I worry about insomnia - I'm a worrier - but I'm being able to sleep these days. Extremely grateful for that.   12. Camera. I'm grateful I have my photography equipment with me. I can shoot self portraits, still life, whatever I want! There's so much I can experiment with even though I'm indoors.   13. Photo archives. To be able to look at my past self. To reminisce and get nostalgic. To recognize my growth. It is a privilege.   14. Apartment. A 3BHK in Gurgaon? Who am I kidding?! I'm insanely grateful that I'm able to afford rent for something like this! I never imagined that I would be able to do this. I have THREE balconies. So what if I only ever clean one and the others are over run by pigeon poop. I still got them.   15. Washing Machine. Because excuse me but I ain't washing clothes by hand. But you know what? If the washing machine did break down during the lockdown and we weren't able to get a repair person, I'd probably try to learn more about how the machine works and try to fix it. If that didn't work, I'd be grateful for at least having a space where I could wash my clothes by hand, if required.

McKoy said sometimes the road seems so long, some referees question if it’s worth it.
 In the Missouri Valley Conference, there are few straight flights to college towns.
 He often has taken connecting flights to the closest city to the school, only to end up having to rent a car and drive a couple of hours to get to the stadium.
 That type of travel will end now that he is in a new conference.
 “I was pleasantly surprised to get the call,” he said. “You just never know. Normally, these things don’t happen until May.”
 The athletic director/referee said he believes the coronavirus has probably freed up time needed to evaluate referees in line to make moves in the ranks.
 “The NFL picks who they want first,” McKoy said.
 After those picks are made, the college-level picks are done, making a slew of referees available for advancement for a selected number of spots.
 “I can’t wait to get started,” He said. “I have a lot of nervous energy.”
 McKoy might be ready to call the shots, but knows the biggest challenge he might be facing is a change to the fall season created by the COVID-19 pandemic.
 “I’ll be ready whenever it starts up,” McKoy said.

This holds true in spades in his latest book, co-authored with his wife Andrea, titled _The Essential Grizzly: The Mingled Fates of Men and Bears_. Sometime back in the hazy past I spent many years living in northwest Montana, a land of prime grizzly habitat. Whether I was fishing for native westslope cutthroat or bull trout, camping or blindly playing with a camera, every year I’d see a number of the bears – normally from a distance but a few times oh so close. More exciting to me was working up a trail and seeing fresh tracks, enormous ones, so recent that they were still filling with water on the moist path or I’d come across steaming mounds of bear sign and I’d go “Damn, one of these guys is very close.” That made me feel alive in ways I can’t explain, even to myself. And over the course of these years, I came to recognize a few of the bears including one female that I saw year after year along an isolated, high mountain valley stream with different broods of cubs every few years. She became a long-distance friend, a creature I looked forward to seeing in late June.

Governos populistas, autoritários e de inspiração fascista, como o que temos no Brasil, necessitam do enfraquecimento das instituições do Estado Democrático de Direito, justamente por serem elas que possuem as condições para limitar seus projetos autoritários e deter a assunção repressiva em direção a uma ditadura de novo tipo, que não necessita de ruptura formal. De igual modo urge calar qualquer divergência e crítica. Os ataques a sindicatos para minar sua organização e atuação junto a trabalhadores não surgem nos textos legais por acaso.

If you can just give them that one hour to tap out, to be part of something. I feel like the show's been getting better and better with so much more story with these characters there's so much deeper we can go. I think the fact that the audience has been with us for so long, we're able to dig deeper and give them better content and more interesting stories as the seasons progress.

The Iowa native became the first true freshman to start for the Hawkeyes in the Kirk Ferentz era, starting eight of 10 games, with seven of those being at right tackle. The following year, he bounced back from a suspension in the 2018 season opener to receive honorable All-Big Ten notice after being a dominant presence over 12 games on the right side, working in tandem with Alaric Jackson. In 2019, he built on his performance, playing 13 games (10 at right tackle) and was named the Big Ten Offensive Lineman of the Year and was a 2019 second-team AP All-American.

Though that world of his has shrunk considerably by the time we first meet The Ram, once numbering thousands in giant arenas and now dwindling to a few dozen inside old American Legion halls. Smaller scale, perhaps, but The Ram is beloved for his ability to appear larger than life, to both inflict and absorb punishment to a long overtaxed body, to inspire the adolescent dreams of anybody who wanted fists of fury to rise above whatever oppressed them.

Renewables still have a long way to go, but they’ve shown us what’s possible – a clean energy future. Solar shares some history with hydraulic fracturing. Both technologies required sustained investment by the federal government and entrepreneurial ingenuity. They both took decades to succeed. We need to remember that lag in planning for next-generation technologies.

Looking for ways to lend a hand during the coronavirus pandemic? Donating personal-protective equipment for use by Utah healthcare providers is one way to get involved.
 A PPE donation station has been set up in Logan to collect a wide variety of items in short supply at medical facilities, including homemade and medical- grade masks, rubber gloves, isolation gowns, infrared thermometers, face shields, hand sanitizers and more.
 The station is staffed by AmeriCorps volunteers working out of Utah State University’s Center for Community Engagement, which has teamed up with the state-run program UServeUtah to collect items at eight different locations around Utah and distribute them where most needed. In addition to contributions from community members, the program is soliciting large-scale donations from manufacturers and individuals with 3D printers.

NEW ORLEANS, La. (WVUE) - Thursday night will be like no other for the New Orleans Saints organization. The Saints, along with 31 other NFL teams, will conduct a first ever virtual draft.GM Mickey Loomis will be conducting the draft from his house, generator in-tow with bad weather possible Thursday. Sean Payton will be across town doing the same.It’s a tough predicament to be in, but it’s the hand each team was dealt while dealing with the coronavirus.“I think the one challenge is that you don’t have as much give and take with your entire staff, all of your scouts and coaches. There’s a lot of conversations that go on, a lot of nuance when you’re talking about a particular player, a particular prospect and the vision that you have for him on your team and so I think we miss some of that," said Mickey Loomis.When they do pick, there will be a ton of options at No. 24 in the first round. This class is loaded at receiver.“I think the most obvious thing is that there’s a lot of receivers at the top of this draft that are really good players and so that’s probably more than most years. I think that’s the thing that jumps out at you the most," said Loomis.With Drew Brees possibly playing only one more season, and Tasyom Hill on a 1-year deal, could this be a year the Saints pick a QB.“Yes, I think that that anytime you have a chance to get a quality quarterback prospect, regardless of your quarterback situation, you would like to take advantage of that. For us it hasn’t come. There has not been the match where we’re picking (in the area) with the prospect that we really like. So I think our approach is exactly the same this year. Look, if there’s someone there that we really like and have a vision for at the time we’re picking then we’re not afraid to pull that trigger," said Loomis.The players picked by the Saints will be playing catch-up come late July, with the team announcing there will be no offseason, just training camp.it comes down to, hey, what’s your long-term vision for these guys? It’s not going to prevent us from taking someone that we have a long-term vision for, but we recognize that we may not get as much in year one as you would otherwise. I think that’s generally true. If we don’t have an offseason with these guys then it’s going to be harder for them, for any player, to contribute in year one than it would ordinarily," said Loomis.Copyright 2020 WVUE.
