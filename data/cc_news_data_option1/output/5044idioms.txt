2\. I noticed just three tipped barrels through the first four rounds. But Monday’s round five had seven tipped barrels. That’s a swing of momentum as a whole. However, Hailey Kinsel is on a roll. The two-time defending world champion just won her second straight round (16.92, first competitor under 17 seconds this week) and third round overall. She’s won money in four of five rounds and leads the average by 0.65 seconds over Brittany Pozzi-Tonozzi. Pozzi-Tonozzi is having a great NFR too, placing second twice and third twice. What a battle between two strong champions.
 3\. Australian Ky Hamilton continues to lead the bull riding average. Perhaps more notable is his lead in the standings over six-time defending world champion Sage Kimzey. Kimzey hasn’t had a good Finals. He’s ridden two bulls to Hamilton’s four covered rides. There are five more rounds to go, but Kimzey needs some good luck, mixed with bad luck for others to not only climb in the average, but the standings too as he’s eighth in the average and fifth in the world standings, some $52,000 behind Hamilton.
 4\. I love to see the camaraderie between competitors and you can always find it all around the arena. The bulldoggers always seem to be slapping backs and high fiving. Obviously, they’re competing against each other but so many of them haze for a fellow bulldogger. They want their friend to do well. Same can be said about the Wrights. This family is famous for so much success in rodeo (5 bronc titles, one All-Around, probably more to come), but what gets me night after night is seeing Rusty, Ryder and Stetson absolutely going nuts for each brother.

Dear Dave,
 I lost my job a few days ago. We had an idea cuts were coming, but I thought it wouldn't happen until well into the new year. My wife works, so that's a good thing and we're both in our 30's. Do you have any advice for how we should handle things during the Christmas season and until I'm working again?
 \- Brandon
 Dear Brandon,
 I'm really sorry to hear this. Losing your job around the holidays can feel like a nightmare.
 But before you despair, remember this is also the season of hope. And hope can't be taken from you. It can only be surrendered. Keep your head held high, and focus on what's still in your control.
 First, cut back on your spending. When your income changes for the worse, eliminating all unnecessary spending is key. This is not the time to put Christmas on a credit card, or dip into retirement to cover holiday expenses. The last thing you should do right now is steal from your future to buy more stuff. Find some kind of seasonal work. Even if you're packing boxes or stocking shelves, you're contributing to your household and easing the stress. This side income will be a real blessing as you continue your career search.
 Be open with your family, and what this change means. If there are kids in the picture, you and your wife should be in agreement on how you handle things where they're concerned. Explain to them in an honest, loving way what has happened, and that Christmas will look a little different this year. A couple of inexpensive gifts may not be out of the question, but as harsh as it sounds, presents are not a priority right now. It may be uncomfortable or disappointing for everyone, but it can also offer a bonding opportunity and a valuable life lesson.
 Keep a positive outlook, and stick to your normal routine as much as possible in the days ahead. Wake up early every morning, and make a list of things you will accomplish that day. Update your resume, start networking, and begin submitting applications like that's your new job. Work hard, stay hopeful, and focus on the goals ahead of you.
 Refuse to give up, Brandon, and you will succeed. May God bless you and your family!

From Idaho, you’d have to travel cross country and more than 2,000 miles east to Vermont before you come across another state with a larger share of electricity generated from clean energy. Through hydropower, wind, solar and other means we generate more than three-fourths of our power from renewables. We also demonstrate to the nation the success of building infrastructure that capitalizes on natural resources to provide affordable energy rates, local economic development, job creation and reduced carbon emissions. This is why it is so exciting to see a national investment further this legacy. The recently announced partnership between the Idaho National Laboratory and Minneapolis’ Xcel Energy marks important progress for American leadership on clean energy. A practical investment in innovation, the project will tackle technical barriers to expand the production and eventually sale of carbon-free hydrogen.


  Idaho’s lucky to have leadership invested in supporting clean energy. Our own Senator Crapo co-chairs the Senate Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Caucus. As Congress enters a lame-duck session and prepares for a new one in January, we need him to continue beating the drum. By offering his support on the partnership and continuing advocacy for an “all of the above” energy approach, the senator can move the U.S. as a whole closer to a truly 21st- century infrastructure and a more sustainable environmental future — not to mention economic recovery from the pandemic.

If we got the first case when 10% of the population had already been vaccinated, then instead of an additional 2.5 people getting infected the number would be just 2.25, or 90% of the R0 value. That’s not a solution, but it’s a start down the road to a solution. Projecting a simple epidemiological model into the future, I saw that vaccinations have a substantial impact once about 40% of the population get their shots. There’s some improvement earlier, and continued improvement with more vaccination, but the 40% figure is a good benchmark to look for.

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a positively-worded briefing document Tuesday that said the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine is safe and effective, raising expectations the regulator is poised to grant emergency approval.
 An independent committee advising the FDA will meet Thursday on the matter, after Britain became the first country to green light the vaccine last week.
 Two months of follow-up data among 38,000 US trial participants after they received their second of two injections "suggest a favorable safety profile, with no specific safety concerns identified that would preclude issuance of an EUA (emergency use authorization)," the FDA document said.
 It added that the vaccine's efficacy in preventing Covid-19 was 95 percent, and it worked uniformly across age groups, genders, and racial groups, as well as among people with underlying conditions.
 In addition, there is some evidence that the vaccine offers protection after the first injection, that it prevents even the worst cases of Covid-19, and protects people who have been previously infected.
 But the committee said more research was needed to confirm these potential findings.
 "By far and away the big takeaway is it appears as good if not better than advertised," Andrew Morris, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Toronto told AFP.
 He added he was particularly excited by data suggesting the first injection might be enough to protect people.
 \- Bell's palsy concern -
 The companies have previously released some of their data in press statements but the FDA has access to a much more detail.
 In a larger group of 43,000 volunteers which included additional adults and adolescents who signed up later, the most common side effects were injection site reactions (84 percent), fatigue (63 percent), headache (55 percent), muscle pain (38 percent), chills (31 percent), joint pain (23.6 percent), fever (14 percent).
 Reactions graded as "severe" were more common after the second dose and less frequent in participants aged 55 and older.
 There were some adverse events classed as "serious" -- the highest grade -- but there was no meaningful imbalance in the frequency these occurred in the vaccine and placebo arms.
 There were four cases of Bell's palsy -- a generally non-serious form of facial droop that most people recover from -- in the vaccine group and none in the placebo group.
 Morris, who has done previous research on this condition, said he was somewhat concerned by this finding, and according to his calculations it occurred at a greater frequency than would be expected in the general population.
 "I don't in any way want anyone to think that this is a reason not to take the vaccine," he said, but it was important to be upfront about potential complications, even if they are very rare and the benefits strongly outweigh the risks.
 There were also some reports of people who got swollen lymph nodes, which Morris said was not immediately concerning but should be watched.
 The advisory group will also consider what additional studies the manufacturers will need to undertake after issuance of an EUA.
 Pfizer has said it wants to transfer everyone in the placebo arm of the study over to the vaccine, but the FDA committee said this had to be balanced against the need to gather more controlled data.

LONDON (AP) — A retired British shop clerk received the first shot in the country’s COVID-19 vaccination program Tuesday, the start of an unprecedented global immunization effort intended to offer a route out of a pandemic that has killed 1.5 million.


  Margaret Keenan, who turns 91 next week, got the shot at 6:31 a.m. on what public health officials have dubbed “V-Day.” She was first in line at University Hospital Coventry, one of several hospitals around the country that are handling the initial phase of the United Kingdom’s program. As luck would have it, the second injection went to a man named William Shakespeare, an 81-year-old who hails from Warwickshire, the county where the bard was born.


  “I feel so privileged to be the first person vaccinated against COVID-19,” said Keenan, who wore a surgical mask and a blue Merry Christmas T-shirt decorated with a cartoon penguin wearing a Santa hat. “It’s the best early birthday present I could wish for because it means I can finally look forward to spending time with my family and friends in the New Year after being on my own for most of the year.”

HILLSDALE -- A 22-year-old Hillsdale man on parole for a previous conviction of breaking-and-entering with intent to commit larceny is back behind bars following a police pursuit Dec. 3 that reached a speed of more than 100 mph.
   
 Arraignment was held Monday for Cordell Jarrod Austin in 2B District Court before Judge Sara S. Lisznyai on felony allegations of fourth-degree fleeing/eluding police and unlawfully driving away an automobile.
   
 Not only was Austin on parole at the time of the two new allegations, he was on bond through Lisznyai's court pending sentencing on a previous conviction of attempted unlawfully driving away of an automobile.
   
 Lisznyai said Monday that Austin was supposed to be in a treatment facility for substance abuse issues at the time.
   
 Although Austin's fate with Michigan Department of Corrections is unknown due to his parole status, Lisznyai sentenced him to 150 days in the Hillsdale County jail, with credit for 27 days served in the attempted auto theft case. He also will pay $425 in fines and costs.
   
 On the two new charges, Austin will be held without bond and next appear in the district court Dec. 23 for a probable cause conference.
   
 The pursuit Dec. 3 was initiated by the Michigan State Police in Pittsford Township and worked its way to U.S. 127, where Austin turned south toward Ohio and reached a speed of around 110 mph. The pursuing trooper was ordered to terminate the pursuit at the state line, but Williams County, Ohio, authorities managed to apprehend Austin near West Unity, Ohio.
   
 Austin was extradited to Michigan to answer for the criminal charges.
   
 Lisznyai said Monday that Austin has committed seven offenses since 2016, when he legally became an adult.

It’s been almost nine months since the pandemic started, and at this point I’ve gotten used to missing things, people, and places that I once took for granted — my favorite ramen spot, which closed for good in March; my local AMC; even my old office. But most of all, I miss lesbian bars.


  Though I came out as bisexual at 17, the first time I visited a lesbian bar was after I graduated from college, when I moved to New York City for an internship. Like most people, I had a ton of things I was excited to do once I arrived. But before visiting classic tourist attractions like the Empire State Building or Central Park, I wanted to go to a lesbian bar. I was hoping to find a place for myself in the queer community, somewhere I could feel at home.


  Advertisement


  Of the 2,100 drinking holes in NYC, by the time I arrived, only three were lesbian bars: Cubbyhole, Henrietta Hudson (both in the West Village), and Ginger’s Bar (in Brooklyn). My first weekend in the city, I decided to go to Henrietta’s, which, frankly, is not what comes to mind when you picture a must-see NYC venue. It’s a small dive bar with a few seats, cheap drinks, and a tiny dance floor that gets way too crowded on weekends. I was thrilled to be there.


  I didn’t know anyone in the city yet, so I went to Henrietta’s by myself. I scored a seat at the bar, and sat there feeling awkward for a few minutes. The sense of loneliness didn’t last long, though. As the bar started to slowly fill up, I suddenly realized that I was surrounded by more queer women than I had ever encountered in my four years in college, which was an experience in itself. I didn’t know them personally, but if I turned to anyone to tell them about my experiences with other women, they would likely be able to relate. Historically, queer bars have been one of the few places where queer people are free to truly be themselves, so most come with a real sense of camaraderie. In fact, soon after I sat down a group of women invited me to join their game of Jenga. I met the people who would become my closest NYC friends that night, and almost every time we went out, we made sure to start or end the night either there, or at Cubbyhole or Ginger’s. But even when I went to a lesbian bar alone, I never felt lonely.

  The strong sense of community and belonging that I felt in lesbian bars was something I’d been searching for since I came out. My coming out story was fairly straightforward and conflict-free — after having crushes on both girls and guys throughout my life, I finally realized I was bisexual my junior year of high school. Most people around me were pretty okay with it, and a couple months later I started dating a woman for the first time. Though she ultimately decided to go back into the closet and dismiss the months we spent together as “confusion”, which was incredibly hurtful to me, the relationship did make it easier for me to get comfortable in my orientation. Feeling at peace, however, didn’t equal feeling at home.


  When I headed off to college in Syracuse, I was certain I could find the supportive queer community I always dreamt of. A couple months into freshman year, though, I realized I had been too optimistic. My public communications program in college consisted of mostly straight, cisgendered people, and while I did not face outward homophobia, whenever I mentioned attraction toward another woman I was mostly met with uncomfortable silence. The queer community in Syracuse outside of the school was extremely small and consisted of older women who mostly grew up together, so it felt out of reach to me. I craved the presence of people who shared my experience as a queer woman, but had no idea where they were. Finding a new queer relationship was also out of the question — how was I supposed to meet a woman I’d like to date when I couldn’t even find queer friends?

  Lesbian bars offered a kind of salvation. In them, I found the community I’d been searching for. As a single woman who hates dating apps, they also became a safe place for me to find  potential dates. When I ask someone out at a lesbian bar, the worst that can happen is they say  they’re not interested. If I tried to approach a woman at a place that does not primarily serve queer people, I’d have to do so without knowing if she’s queer, and without knowing if she’s homophobic. The risk of the encounter potentially turning violent was something that kept me from approaching other women with ease since I came out, and lesbian bars were the only places where I could put that worry to rest. I preferred to have most of my first dates in lesbian bars for the same reason. First dates are stressful enough as is without having to wonder, “Are the people over there staring because they think we’re cute, or am I about to be hate-crimed?”


  I haven’t been to Henrietta’s, or any other lesbian bar, since March 2020, when restaurants began shutting down in New York City due to the pandemic. And I fear for their future. The last couple of decades had already been hard on lesbian bars; their numbers dwindled from around 200 in 1980 to only 15 in 2020, according to The Lesbian Bar Project’s website. Between 2007 and 2019, nearly 52 percent of bars catering to queer women closed their doors, research conducted by Oberlin College professor Greggor Mattson, PhD, showed. There is still no knowing when the pandemic will end, and by then these numbers might even be smaller. The places where I first felt like a true part of the queer community could be gone forever.

  Resilience is an inherent part of the queer experience, so it’s not a surprise that all around the U.S., lesbian bars have been fighting to stay afloat via fundraisers, virtual events, and selling merch. There’s no knowing if these measures will be enough, but I’m desperately hoping that they will be. I spent most my life feeling like I was out of place, and lesbian bars are one of the few places where I feel I belong. To be able to sit in a place that is for and owned by queer women like myself is a profound experience. Going to these lesbian bars and being surrounded by other queer people, having conversations, making connections, or even just existing there has been incredibly validating and has helped me feel truly at home in my own orientation and desires. I hope that when the pandemic is over, I will still be able to head to Henrietta’s on a Thursday, oldies night. Eighties hip-hop will be playing. I’ll find the last seat at the already-cramped bar, order myself a cheap vodka-soda, and I will feel like I’m home.

 The relief amount of ₹10,000 was announced by the government for households affected by the devastating October floods.
 The amount was initially disbursed in cash by the GHMC and Revenue officials who went from door-to-door distributing the relief. However, the initiative ended in a fiasco, as several genuine victims complained non-receipt of the relief, and allegations abounded about swindling of the funds by officials and politicians, and disbursement to families unaffected by the floods.
 Stung by the criticism, government has shifted the distribution to online through Mee Seva Centres, which continued even after notification for GHMC elections. The relief was deposited directly into the accounts of the persons who approached the centre, upon verification of Aadhaar ids and ration cards. Even there, the distribution was not fair, as no attempt was made to check the genuineness of the claims.
 The distribution was put paid to temporarily, after the State Election Commission issued orders terming it violation of model code of conduct. During his poll campaign, Chief Minister K.Chandrasekhar Rao had assured people that the relief distribution would continue immediately after the elections, believing which scores of people thronged Mee Seva centres in various localities of the city on Monday.
 They were a disappointed lot, as government issued orders shutting the centres for the day, and GHMC Commissioner issued the statement about field survey.

A vantagem da tecnologia usada por este consórcio, com base num vetor modificado de adenovírus, relativamente a concorrentes, nomeadamente da Moderna e Pfizer/BioNTech, que usaram um mensageiro de ácido ribonucleico, é que a vacina pode ser fabricada em grandes quantidades a baixo custo e não precisa de armazenamento a temperaturas muito baixas.
 Nenhuma hospitalização ou doença grave foi observada nos grupos vacinados e, num total de 23.848 voluntários no Reino Unido, Brasil e África do Sul, só foram registadas três reações graves potencialmente relacionadas com a vacina.
 Como apenas cinco casos incluídos na análise primária ocorreram em pessoas com mais de 55 anos, a eficácia da vacina em grupos de idade mais avançada não pôde ser avaliada, mas será determinada em análises futuras.
 O professor Andrew Pollard, diretor do Grupo de Vacinas de Oxford e investigador-chefe dos Testes de Vacinas de Oxford, defendeu que esta análise mostra que "esta nova vacina tem um bom histórico de segurança e eficácia contra o coronavírus".
 A AstraZeneca tinha anunciado no mês passado um "estudo adicional" para validar os resultados da eficácia da vacina quando foi usada apenas metade da quantidade na primeira dose, resultado de um erro no processo de fabricação.

It's not often that you see a Tuesday game in the NFL, but for the second time this year, we'll be getting one and that will be happening tonight when the Ravens host the Cowboys.
 For the Cowboys, the Tuesday game means they'll be making some NFL history and that's because they're about to become the first team in the Super Bowl era to play at least one game on each day of the week. The Cowboys played on a Wednesday back in 2012 and last played on a Friday back in 1999, which means they've now hit all seven days of the week. The Titans and Vikings are the only two teams who have even played on six different days of the week.
 So how did we end up in a situation where Baltimore and Dallas are playing on a Tuesday? Glad you asked.
 This game was originally scheduled as the Thursday night game in Week 13. However, the NFL had to throw that plan out the window after a COVID-19 outbreak hit the Ravens, which caused a postponement of Baltimore's Week 12 game against the Steelers.
 The Ravens-Steelers game was originally supposed to played on Thanksgiving Day, but it actually got postponed three times. First, the game was moved to Sunday, Nov. 29, but then the NFL realized that wasn't going to be possible, so the game was postponed to Tuesday, Dec. 1. As positive COVID tests continued to pour in for the Ravens, the NFL decided to postpone the game one more day to Wednesday, Dec. 2.

With the district reporting no major dip in the voter turnout due to the pandemic, all the fronts seem quite optimistic about the electoral outcome.
 The final polling percentage in the district has been recorded as 73.43 which includes 73.11% male votes and 73.7 % female votes. The percentage of transpersons who cast their votes is 15.79.
 While Kollam Corporation registered a voter turnout of 66%, the percentage in the four municipalities are Paravur (73), Punalur (73), Karunagapplly (79) and Kottarakra (68). Among the block panchayats Oachira recorded the highest polling percentage of 78 while the same in other blocks are as follows: Kottarakara (73), Chittumala (74), Chavara (76), Cahdayamangalam (73), Ithikkara (73), Mukhathala (73), Sasthamcotta (77), Pathanapuram (72), Vettikavala (73), and Anchal (72).
 The LDF leadership in the district is confident about retaining their dominance, especially in Kollam Corporation and the district panchayat.
 “We have fielded a total of 1,598 candidates and the poll victory in 2015 local body elections and 2016 Assembly elections will be repeated. We are certain that there will be an improvement in vote share too. In 2015 we had lost four out of the total 26 seats in district panchayat and this time we will reclaim Chavara, Thevalakkara, Kalayapuram, and Vettikavala seats. In the last local body polls the voters had elected LDF in 77 out of the total 85 local bodies,” said S.Sudevan, CPI(M) district secretary.
 According to DCC president Bindu Krishna, the UDF will win all the local bodies in the district with a thumping majority. “Disgruntled over the corrupt LDF governance during the last four-and-a-half years, the people of Kollam turned out in big numbers to cast their votes in favour of the UDF,” she said.
 She added that the front could make a significant headway in Kollam Corporation, the district panchayat, block panchayats and all grama panchayts. “The people in the district have cast their votes to dislodge the ruling front and the verdict will be an answer to LDF government’s attempts to hide massive corruption,” she said.
 The NDA camp is equally hopeful and the leaders say the front will wrest power in several seats. “For the first time BJP will rule Kollam Corporation and we will emerge as a strong Opposition in many parts. As per the post-polling reports, we are all set to make history,” said BJP district president B.B. Gopakumar.

Ever since the start of the global pandemic, the world has been eagerly awaiting the development and approval of COVID-19 vaccines. Not only will these save lives, but kick start the economy and pave the way to a return to normality. Americans have welcomed recent news, with cautious optimism, that two vaccines (by Pfizer and Moderna) will receive FDA approval this year. However, current predictions expect just 3.7% of the American population to receive the vaccine in 2020. Naturally, and according to basic economic theory - there is more demand when there is less supply - many Americans will be determined to be first on the list. But the question remains, just how desperate would they be to jump the queue and get vaccinated first?

 It's already been a tremendous season on the football field for the Inland Lakes Bulldogs.
 While their MHSAA 8-Player Division 1 state semifinal matchup at Suttons Bay hasn't been played just yet, some of the Bulldogs -- both players and coaches -- are getting much-deserved accolades for their contributions on the gridiron.
 A total of five Inland Lakes players and coaches were recently named to the Michigan High School Football Coaches Association's (MHSFCA) 8-Player All- Region team.
 Leading the way on the offensive side was junior quarterback Mason Blumke, who has passed for 603 yards and seven touchdowns and added 433 rushing yards and seven touchdowns this season.
 Joining Blumke on the All-Region squad was senior running back Beau Vizina, who has rushed for 1,037 yards and scored 12 touchdowns.
 Helping protect Blumke and create holes for Vizina to run through all season long has been senior offensive lineman Joey Foldenauer, who also earned a spot on the All-Region team.
 On the defensive side, senior defensive back Derick Armstrong -- a player with 45 total tackles, nine tackles for loss, two interceptions and five fumble recoveries -- secured his spot on the team.
 Rounding out Inland Lakes was head coach Travis Meyer, who helped guide the Bulldogs to their first-ever regional football championship. Meyer was one of two coaches to earn the 8-Player Division 1 Regional Coach of the Year honor.
 After a winless first campaign, things have taken off in Year 2 for Meyer, who has the Bulldogs currently at 8-1 on the season, including three postseason victories.
 The Pellston Hornets had three players and one coach make the All-Region team following an impressive 7-1 campaign.
 Offensively, junior quarterback Isaiah Crawford led the Hornets on the All- Region squad. During his campaign, Crawford threw for 803 yards and 12 touchdowns and rushed for 434 yards and eight touchdowns.
 Senior wide receiver Ian Reimann made the squad after recording 390 receiving yards and six touchdowns in his final season with the program.
 On special teams, speedy kickoff and punt returner Nathan Chiles joined his teammates on the team. Chiles, a junior, returned two kickoffs and two punts this season. Offensively, Chiles contributed with 406 rushing yards and five touchdowns.
 The other coach to earn Regional Coach of the Year honors was Pellston head coach Jack Carter, who guided the Hornets to a 7-1 record in his fourth season.
 In addition to earning a share of the Ski Valley Conference 8-Player championship, Carter also guided Pellston to its first-ever playoff victory after a win over Brimley at home in later October.

Why can't Iran keep its scientific potential? Back in the early 2000s, Iranian opposition group Mujahiddin-e Khalq started publishing names and addresses of famous nuclear physicists on the Internet. In 2008, Fakhrizadeh was put on UN and US sanctions lists as the architect of the "Iranian nuclear technology." Why wasn't he classified? Did it cause an internal split inside the country? Are there traitors at security services or state bodies?
 Pravda.Ru asked these and other questions to Tofik Abbasov, a political scientist, expert on the Middle East.
  _Nuclear physicist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, was known as the father of the Iranian nuclear bomb, which does not even actually exist, as it is believed. The scientist was killed, but no one knows whether Iran has a nuclear bomb. This has been the fifth attempt on the life of Iranian scientists in the past ten years, and only one of them managed to survive. According to Iranian officials, there is a hand of Israel in all of those assassinations. Do Iranian special services work at all? Why does Iran let its brightest minds be shot in broad daylight? Iran is a closed country. Why can't Iran protect its best scientists?_

International history, national history, local history, personal history--each of these layers is represented in this one memorial. And each layer is suffused with trauma and deep feelings of suffering and betrayal. The Katyn monument is one of the most emotionally charged memorials in the world. Is it any wonder, then, that Steven Fulop's surprise announcement that the monument would be moved away from Exchange Place--purely for the sake of commercial redevelopment--was greeted with such defensive outrage?
 In the days after the announcement was made, debates about it took place in the local and national newspapers, on social media, in the city council, on Polish radio, and between Polish and American diplomats. At the center of this storm of emotion stood the local Polish-American community, many of whom felt betrayed all over again.
 Across the Atlantic, in Poland, there was a much better understanding of the emotions involved, but even here they did not quite get the full picture. Poland embraced the Katyn Memorial as a symbol of Polish identity, when in fact it was something slightly different--it was a symbol of Polish-American identity. It commemorates a specific kind of loss, and a specific kind of martyrdom, unique to those Poles who were forced into exile after 1945.
 The local dimension to the controversy could only be fully appreciated by Jersey City residents. The city's old-timers already felt betrayed by their council, who appeared to be putting the needs of newcomers and big businesses above their own. To such people, the Katyn Memorial was the symbol of a local identity that was itself being stabbed in the back. One city councilor, Rich Boggiano, was particularly vocal about leaving the memorial where it was. "I'm sick and tired of all these new people coming here," he told the local newspaper, "wanting to change everything about Jersey City.
 Once people get riled up, it is difficult to calm them down again. The city council tried to rectify their mistake and started to consult local Polish- American community leaders, but it was too late. They promised to move the monument just one block south, but indignant protesters refused to negotiate. Anyone who argued in favor of the move was shouted down. The Polish president himself gave the relocation his blessing, but was immediately denounced by local protesters as a traitor to their cause: in May 2018, when he made a personal visit to the memorial, he was greeted there by demonstrators with cries of "Shame!"

2020 has been a year to forget for most of us and, in the NFL, that rings especially true for the New York Jets, who have yet to win a single game through Week 13. As they possibly try to search for a 'W' in their remaining four games, coming anywhere close to the playoffs is out of the question. For the most part, the Jets are looking to a 2021 season that does have promise for a brighter tomorrow. And that brings us to our little experiment today. We've constructed a blueprint for New York to follow that could put them on a path to turning this winless 2020 squad into a more respectable organization and possibly become a contender in the seasons to come.
 Before we jump into the steps, let's take a look at two key tools that the Jets will be working with during the 2021 offseason: draft capital and cap space. According to the figures at Spotrac, New York is projected to have the second-most amount of cap space ($82,776,619) in the entire NFL, only looking up to the Jacksonville Jaguars ($84,975,623). Along with that bag of cash at the ready when free agency opens up, GM Joe Douglas is stockpiled with draft picks, including in 2021 where they have two first-rounders, a second, two thirds, and a fourth, all of which have the possibility of being inside the top-100 selections.
 That's quite the hammer and nail to help jumpstart this rebuild, which could happen sooner than later if they go down this route.
 ## Continue to lose
 Victories are just temporary highs and long-term lows for the Jets, who are not in the business of winning games in 2020. In fact, I'd guarantee that most New York fans were jumping for joy when Henry Ruggs III pulled down the 46-yard touchdown reception to give the Raiders the last-second win over the Jets in Week 13. That loss kept New York on the inside track at the No. 1 overall pick in the 2021 NFL Draft where there is a generational talent at the top. If the Jets pull out a win somewhere over the next month, that could take them out of the top spot and they could miss out on Trevor Lawrence. While this is the last type of NFL history that a team ever wants to make, the Jets are better off going 0-16 than anything else.

How widespread are the protests, and what is likely to happen next?
 Farmers from across north India have resisted the reforms, but the protests have by and large been led by unions from Punjab and Haryana, two relatively prosperous states where the government-mandated markets are most developed, and where the government buys a majority of the wheat and rice produced by farmers.
 "Farmers who depend on the system are worried that it will be removed over time, and they are not sure what will come in its place," says Krishnamurthy. "The narrative is that private investment will come in its place. But that is not something that gives a lot of farmers a great deal of comfort."
 The protests so far have won the unions access to the government for negotiations. Three rounds of talks have happened so far, but have been inconclusive. More are scheduled for Wednesday. "The protests and the negotiations are the beginning of a process that should have started at the beginning," Krishnamurthy says. "When you bring consequential reforms like this, without having adequate consultation and consensus building, there is a genuine expression of anxiety and concern."

Si chiama Ifts, International Flight training school, ed e il centro, promosso dall'Aeronautica militare in collaborazione con Leonardo, che nascera nella base militare a una decina di chilometri da Cagliari. Punto di partenza, come ricorda Giulio Calvisi, sottosegretario alla Difesa, la lettera d'intenti del 2018 firmata dall'Aeronautica militare e da Leonardo «al fine di soddisfare le richieste, nazionali e straniere, in tema di addestramento al volo» e realizzare nella base aerea di Decimomannu «una Scuola di volo internazionale attraverso una partnership nel settore specifico». Il programma prevede la realizzazione di una vera e propria cittadella per ospitare gli allievi e il personale con area ricreativa, mensa e impianti sportivi. All'interno spazio per 22 aerei T-346A, 18 messi a disposizione dall'Aeronautica militare e 4 da Leonardo. E inoltre un edificio per ospitare le aule di formazione e per l'installazione di un moderno sistema di addestramento a terra, comprensivo di una serie di sistemi di simulazione di ultima generazione. Negli spazi interni poi il centro di addestramento al volo avanzato che, chiariscono da Leonardo, «costituira il riferimento internazionale nella formazione dei piloti militari a partire dalla Fase IV (Advanced/Lead-In to Fighter Training) per preparare i piloti, che verranno successivamente impiegati operativamente sui velivoli di 4ª e 5ª generazione come l'Eurofighter o l'F-35». Tra i sistemi utilizzati anche quello che integra l'attivita in volo a quella a terra. Una sorta di connessione tra l'aereo in volo e il simulatore presente in aula. «Tutti elementi che costituiscono il cosiddetto Ground Based Training System di Leonardo, in sigla Gbts - spiegano da Leonardo -. Un sistema che, anche grazie a simulatori come il Full Mission Simulator dell'M-346, permette agli aspiranti piloti dei velivoli di ultima generazione di imparare il volo in formazione, il rifornimento in volo, le manovre basiche, le tattiche avanzate di combattimento, sia di giorno che di notte. Il tutto senza staccare i piedi da terra». In pratica un ambiente di simulazione integrato dove reale e virtuale danno vita a un'unica "realta" in cui i piloti che volano sui simulatori possono interagire con altri piloti che, in quello stesso momento, sono su un aereo in volo, come se tutti stessero operando nello stesso contesto. I piloti sugli aerei vedono sui propri apparati di bordo cio che i piloti sui simulatori vedono sui propri monitor a terra. Con la riproduzione di scenari complessi, con la presenza di massimo 10 aerei tra forze amiche e nemiche, che interagiscono come se stessero tutti volando nello stesso cielo. Avvio in due step a partire dal 2021 e poi attivita per circa vent'anni.

"I still have the emails too," Marshall said. "I asked Regal, 'Hey what's going on? I had the tryout. Now it's taken away.' I guess I led him to the answer. 'Is it because of my age?' And was like, 'Yes, unfortunately. We'll still use you as an extra.'
 "Even at the _SmackDown_ , he said, 'If we hired you, how many people would order The Network for you,' because that was when they were pushing The Network, and I was like, 'My mom [and] my dad. They might even share their password.' I didn't have an answer, and I specifically told him, 'If you're telling me that I can't work here because of that, but I'm good enough to work here, I can live with that deep down.' Hey, as long as you can tell me my work is great, I'm happy with that, but then I guess he felt bad.
 "So maybe that's he did the whole 'well, we're going to give you the tryout.' I don't know what the reason was. [The Rock] always talks about the NFL being the best thing that never happened to him. Same with me. It was the best thing that never happened because it made me go all in on wrestling."
 Marshall said he was later booked as an extra at _NXT_ where he was set to face Akam of Authors of Pain in a handicap match. He talked about why he did not want to do the match, especially after having neck surgery.
 "I got booked as an extra at _NXT_ , and they wanted me to work with the Author's Of Pain. And I said no because I didn't have anything to lose, except my life and my career, [because they're super big and super green]," Marshall revealed. "It was a two on one. It was me and another extra vs. this one guy, and I remember Scotty 2 Hotty came up. He was the agent.
 "He's like, 'Hey, it's going to be you two guys,' and I'm looking around. And I asked the guy. He's a nice guy too, but I could see. He had already hurt somebody. Actually, he hurt the guy that we just signed, Anthony Bowens, because he powerbombed one guy onto Anthony Bowens' his head. I said to him, 'Hey, what moves do you think you're going to do to us?' He was like, 'Well, what does it matter?' I was like, 'Well, I was just curious' I was trying to politic.
 "He was like, 'Oh I'll probably do this and then a powerbomb, and I'll powerbomb the other guy onto you. 'The short of it was I literally just looked at him and was like, 'Oh, okay.' I looked at Scotty, and I was like, 'Nope not doing it.'"
 Marshall said that he would have rather been put in there with a Bobby Roode or someone else that he can make look good. He noted that he only made $200 for the booking and did not want to risk injury noting that the person who took his spot also got hurt.
 "The kid who took my place got hurt," Marshall pointed out. "He put him in a headlock, and he just picked him up and threw him into the aisleway. He didn't mean to do it, but he's just so strong. I remember telling Matt Bloom because he said, 'We specifically chose you for this spot because you can sell.' I was like, 'Well, I really appreciate it, but here's what's going to happen. I'm going to take these moves, and I'm either going to get up and be okay and I'm gonna make $200, or I'm never going to walk again and I'm gonna make $200.' To me, it's just not worth it."
 Marshal then looked back to 2011 where he was offered a contract to ROH. He noted that while the higher ups were all in on getting him signed, there was backstage heat that hurt him.
 "When I first started with Ring of Honor, they offered me a contract," Marshall recalled. "I did a tryout. It was like a paid tryout, it was a two- day tryout, but by the end of day one, it was Jim Cornette at the time, Delirious and Kevin Kelly, and they were like, 'Hey, as long as you show up tomorrow, you got a job.' And I was like, 'Oh that's great. Cool. I had never been in a big company before, so I didn't know the politics of this, that and the other, and right away, I didn't make any friends.
 "I always goof around, and I ended up making a joke to someone like this kid hurt me, bad. I made them look really good. It was Jimmy Jacobs' guy. So I knew he had all these friends. So I made him look really good because he did Brazilian Capoeira wrestling. He kicked me in the head maybe five times, and I gave an Alabama Slam. And I kind of hurt him, but I checked on him."
 He talked more about cutting a promo on the world champion but noted that was only a backstage thing that didn't make TV and was only something that people wanted to see from him. He said injuries started to pile up and things were not going well in his personal life, which led to him asking for his release. He revealed that he was only making $150 a match, which he pointed out isn't something to live off of.
 "I finally just asked for my release. I hated it that much where I was just like I don't want to be here," Marshall stated. "I'm making $150 a match. When they gave me the contract, I didn't laugh, but I said, 'Is this real?' And they're like, 'What do you mean? This is what the contract is.' I'm like, '$150 a match? We work three times a month. That's $450. It doesn't pay for my car,' and they're like, 'What kind of car do you drive?' It's like, 'It doesn't matter what kind of car I drive!' It's a Cadillac by the way, but it doesn't matter. This isn't a real job. I need to have my normal life. It's the realities of wrestling. So when that happened, I asked for my release. They wouldn't give it to me because I guess Shelton Benjamin had just asked for his release too."
 Marshall described his stints in ROH as "interning" there noting that Kevin Kelly had him do commentary for Women Of Honor. However, he would also sit in production meetings and learn about that side of the business.
 "I used to, I call it, interning at Ring of Honor," Marshall described. "I had opened a school, and I wanted to learn because I thought I could never wrestle again because the WWE told me that they weren't going to hire me because of my neck injury. So I was like s--t. Well, I don't know what else to do. I'm good at running restaurants. I can do something. I'm just not going to enjoy it for the rest of my life.
 "So long story short, I decided to open up this school with my wife in Georgia, and I started going to Ring of Honor shows because of Kevin Kelly. I knew him really well, and he was a big fan of mine back when. And he was like, 'Just do commentary for Women Of Honor. That'll be the reason you're here, but while you're here, sit in the production meetings. Pay attention and learn as much as you can,' and I was like great."
 Marshall said that while he was under contract with ROH, he took bookings as an extra for _NXT_. He noted that the episodes would air when his contract would expire. However, he got a call from now former ROH executive Jeff Jones called him about taking the booking, which led Marshall to point out that he asked for his release that was never granted.
 "I was in Florida, and _NXT_ called," Marshall said. "They needed someone. They were just starting to use extras, and I was like, 'Hey, I'm under contract -- when the episode airs, I won't be under contract anymore, but I am right now,' and the girl at the office was like, 'Hey, if you don't care, we don't care.' And honestly, at the time, I was like, I don't care.
 "She's like, 'And I'll book you for the next six that you've asked for' because I was like, 'Hey, my contract's about to be up. I see you're in all these dates for extra work.' So of course right away, I do the match, and it's a taped _NXT_ show. Before I'm even out of the ring, my phone's blowing up. Jeff Jones, who was working at Ring of Honor, 'Stooge' Jeff Jones.
 "Right away, he's like, 'Are you doing something you're not supposed to be doing?' I was like, what are they going to do? Take $150? Fire me. I asked for my release. Then when the WWE thing didn't work out, I was like, 'Aw, that was dumb.' That's a little stupid, but I was young, and Delirious, at the time, he understood. He was like, 'Hey man, legally, I have to be mad at you because you breached your contract, but your contract is up in two weeks. It is what it is. Don't worry about it. We're just not going to re-sign you as a punishment,' and I just continued to work for them on and off after that."

France has said it will cut its reliance on nuclear energy to 50% from 75% by 2035 and has yet to make a final decision on whether to build next-generation EPR nuclear reactors.
 That is due by 2023, by which time state-controlled utility EDF's Flamanville 3 EPR project should be up and running, but Macron said he wanted to make a big push on preparations by next year.
 "The preparatory studies around the construction of new reactors are key and I want them to continue and be wrapped up in the coming months," Macron said during a visit to nuclear components maker Framatome, part of EDF.
 EDF, which has been plagued by delays and cost overruns on existing projects, has already said it plans to unveil a new, cheaper-to-build version of its EPR nuclear reactor by mid-2021.
 Macron nonetheless signalled broad support for the industry, even as he flagged the need to move more towards renewable energy. He said France's next- generation aircraft carrier would be nuclear-powered.

The relationship continues to deteriorate between the Houston Rockets and superstar guard James Harden, who hasn't reported for team practices yet this week. Rockets head coach Stephen Silas hasn't given much information on when Harden could be expected at training camp, saying Monday it was a "setback" while the team is trying to get back in the swing of things.
 There have been numerous videos circulating around social media of Harden apparently partying across the country, from Atlanta to Las Vegas, and no one within Houston's organization seems to know when he'll turn up. For the last month rumors have been surfacing that Harden wanted out of Houston, and now they seem to be coming up again. Harden reportedly informed the Rockets before the start of training camp that he would be open to a trade to the Philadelphia 76ers, or any other contender, per ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski and Tim MacMahon.
 When the initial reports that Harden was looking to be traded surfaced a while back, the Sixers and the Brooklyn Nets were the two teams that were linked to the superstar, though nothing gained traction with either franchise. No talks have materialized with the Sixers yet, per Wojnarowski, as new Philadelphia president -- and former Rockets general manager -- Daryl Morey has been adamant about keeping Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons together for the time being.
 In order to even consider trading Harden, the Rockets are reportedly asking for a return that includes a young franchise cornerstone, several first-round picks and/or up-and-coming players on rookie contracts. In order for the Sixers to meet that request, that would require trading one of Embiid or Simmons, with the latter being brought up in trade rumors when this report originally surfaced.

Graham appeared on Fox News Monday night, where he claimed a "civil war" was brewing in Georgia over the election results. The Peach State unexpectedly flipped blue for Biden in the days after election night thanks to a huge influx of mail-in ballots cast by Democrats.


  During the appearance on Sean Hannity's show, Graham, one of Trump's staunchest and most enduring allies, continued to push Georgia officials to interfere with the election.


  "It's not unreasonable to ask the legislature to come back in and order an audit of the signatures in the presidential race to see if the system worked," Graham said on Hannity. "What is unreasonable is to sit on your ass and do nothing when you've got a chance to save the country."


  Even if Trump were to be awarded Georgia, Biden would still have more than 270 electoral votes, the threshold for winning the presidency.


  Graham's consistent push back against the results in Georgia has landed him in trouble before. In mid-November, an ethics complaint was filed against the Seneca Republican after reports surfaced that he called the Georgia Secretary of State and allegedly asked if mail-in ballots in counties with a high rate of mismatched signatures could be thrown out. Graham has called those allegations "ridiculous."


  "Get a grip. Get a grip," Clyburn said on CNN Tuesday. "I think he's lost grip on reality."


  "I thought that I knew Lindsey Graham, but I must have been mistaken," he added.


  The Columbia Democrat did agree with Graham's comment about a "civil war" brewing, though he added that "the result would be the same."


  "This country is not going to allow this kind of activity to take place," Clyburn said.

 Dear Dave,
 I lost my job a few days ago. We had an idea cuts were coming, but I thought it wouldn't happen until well into the new year. My wife works, so that's a good thing and we're both in our 30's. Do you have any advice for how we should handle things during the Christmas season and until I'm working again?
 \- Brandon
 Dear Brandon,
 I'm really sorry to hear this. Losing your job around _the holidays_ can feel like a nightmare.
 But before you despair, remember this is also the season of hope. And hope can't be taken from you. It can only be surrendered. Keep your head held high, and focus on what's still in your control.
 First, cut back on your spending. When your income changes for the worse, eliminating all unnecessary spending is key. This is not the time to put Christmas on a credit card, or dip into retirement to cover holiday expenses. The last thing you should do right now is steal from your future to buy more stuff. Find some kind of seasonal work. Even if you're packing boxes or stocking shelves, you're contributing to your household and easing the stress. This side income will be a real blessing as you continue your career search.
 Be open with _your family_ , and what this change means. If there are kids in the picture, you and your wife should be in agreement on how you handle things where they're concerned. Explain to them in an honest, loving way what has happened, and that Christmas will look a little different this year. A couple of inexpensive gifts may not be out of the question, but as harsh as it sounds, presents are not a priority right now. It may be uncomfortable or disappointing for everyone, but it can also offer a bonding opportunity and a valuable _life lesson_.
 Keep a positive outlook, and stick to your normal routine as much as possible in the days ahead. Wake up early every morning, and make a list of things you will accomplish that day. Update your resume, start networking, and begin submitting applications like that's your new job. Work hard, stay hopeful, and focus on the goals ahead of you.
 Refuse to give up, Brandon, and you will succeed. May God bless you and your family!

And probably the most misleading thing that I saw was that the advertisements alleged that workers would be making a minimum wage. And that is the most important thing for your viewers and listeners to understand about Prop 22 and the danger that it poses, is that it takes away access to a time-based minimum wage, so people are no longer getting paid for all the time that they work. They are only getting paid when they have an assignment. So, all of the risks and liabilities traditionally associated with doing business are now on the workers themselves. Drivers like Cherri cannot, therefore, predict how much they will make in a given day or a given week. It is at the whim and whimsy of both demand and the corporations themselves.

WELLEN PARK — Ground is breaking for another Wellen Park community.
 Neal Communities announced this week the name of the latest neighborhood is Avelina in Wellen Park's Playmore District.
 Avelina will have 96 homes when completed.
 "A gated, maintenance-assisted community, Avelina will offer British West Indies and Coastal style homes in five floorplans ranging from 2,327 to 2,752 square feet," Neal Communities said in a news release.
 It is less than a mile to CoolToday Park, where the Atlanta Braves hold spring training annually.
   
 A grand opening should happen later this year for Avelina. One model home will be built for viewing.
 "It is also less than a mile from Downtown Wellen, situated on 175 lakefront acres and expected to open in the first quarter of 2022," the news release states. "Plans for Downtown Wellen include shopping, dining and entertainment options, a town hall, children’s playground and splash pad, food truck kiosk area and an outfitter renting e-bikes, paddle boards and kayaks."
 Wellen Park is the new name selected for much of West Villages — which has been consistently one of the top selling master planned communities for the past five years, including No. 3 in 2019 and the first half of 2020.
 "The name Wellen means 'waves' in German and 'wellness' in Dutch, and the entire community is designed around a focus of living well at every stage of life," the news release said.

As the football spotlight now moves solely onto the familiar sight of a Dublin v Mayo All-Ireland final, a final nod deserves to be given to the losing semi-finalists. While both may have suffered heavy defeats, the scenes in the Athletic Grounds in Armagh when Cavan ended a 23-year wait and particularly at Pairc Ui Chaoimh where Tipperary broke an even longer 85-year drought undoubtedly lifted spirits beyond their own provinces at a time when spirits needed lifting. The fact that Tipp managed it on the weekend marking the Bloody Sunday centenary and the death of Michael Hogan while wearing the colours their predecessors wore that fateful day added an extra layer of emotion and poignancy to it. And the panel on the latest edition of The Throw- In, Independent.ie's podcast on association with Bord Gáis Energy were keen to accentuate the positives of the Premier's run before focus moves onto the hurling and football finals.&quot;They will be a little disappointed. I think David Power said they were hit with 3-6 on turnovers. Cillian O'Connor's third goal is a real sickener, Liam Casey breaks the oldest rule in the GAA not to play the ball across your own goal and they were punished at the highest level in fairness,&quot; GAA correspondent Michael Verney said. &quot;They just left behind a lot of chances on Sunday. Sweeney should have had an early goal but in fairness, it was a great save by David Clark. It wasn't even seen in the first instance that there was even a block on it when Quinlivan shimmied to his left.&quot;But you can't take away a magical year for them where the stars really aligned. Quinlivan wouldn't have been around. If you had said that Colin O'Riordan would play in an All-ireland semi final in 2020 people would have thought you were mad. It just wouldn't have looked logistically possible. So it's still been a brilliant year.&quot;The manner in which those literal stars aligned means there&rsquo;ll be questions over whether 2020 will prove to be a flash in the pan or whether Tipp can push on. After all, having beaten a Dublin team containing eight players later to win SFC medals in the 2011 minor final, Tipp did develop into a team capable of reaching a senior semi- final in 2016. However, after falling to the same opposition as last Sunday, they struggled to repeat the trick until the unique circumstances of this season. For Verney, that will come down to whether the loss of O&rsquo;Riordan back to Sydney Swans in the AFL can be compensated for by the return of players such as Ian Fahey from injury. And another factor could be if the success of this season can persuade talented footballers like Séamus Kennedy to join Liam McGrath, Bill Maher and Steven O'Brien in returning to the bigger ball from the hurling panel. &quot;They've tended to make progress and then regress maybe a small bit the next year,&quot; he explained.&quot;Even after getting into the 2016 semi final, they were beaten by Cork albeit in a very close game in Munster. So they'll be keen to keep the graph fairly high. &quot;I think it was important for Tipperary to have everyone nearly back on board that they could have had this year. They won't have Colin O'Riordan next year, It'll be interesting to see if Michael Quinlivan and a few others go traveling having had their travels cut short this year. &quot;They'll potentially lose another couple, Philip Austin and maybe Brian Fox are kind of getting to that age. But it depends on when your inter-county season happens next year. They could be able to hold on to those guys if it just rolls into another inter-county season in February or March.&quot;It's been a mad year all told and in fairness, they went down fighting as well. A lot of things went wrong on Sunday, and they still put up a good show. Score 3-13 in an All- Ireland semi-final then you're probably expecting to be on the right side of the result. &quot;So absolutely no shame in being beaten and they're never going to forget the events of two weeks ago in Pairc Ui Chaoimh.&quot;

After all the crazy things that have happened in 2020, nothing should surprise me anymore. I mean, we've seen murder hornets, locusts and a squirrel with bubonic plague, and yet somehow, I was completely shocked by Washington's upset win over the Steelers.
 On paper, I feel like I should have seen this one coming. After all, this had trap game written all over it. Not only were the Steelers in the middle of playing three games in 12 days, but they had to play their biggest rival (Baltimore) before Washington and their next game is a showdown against the 8-3 Bills and let's be honest, if the Steelers were going to overlook one team in that three-game stretch, it was definitely going to be the 4-7 team that plays in the worst division in football. I guess the joke's on the Steelers for overlooking Washington and the joke's on me for being surprised about it.
 Now that the upset is official, I'd like to give a shoutout to Pick Six Podcast host Will Brinson, who might have been the only person in America who actually picked Washington to win. I guess even a blind squirrel with bubonic plague finds a nut once in awhile.
 Anyway, we've got a big newsletter today and that's because we have to cover BOTH games from Monday along with a preview for Tuesday's game (MORE FOOTBALL). As always, please tell everyone you know to subscribe to this newsletter (Click here to subscribe), and you know what, now that I'm thinking about it, you should also feel free to tell people you don't know.

“Bullpen is an area we’d like to improve, and we feel like he’s a positive addition in that area,” Minasian said. “He has a history of pitching late in games, a history of pitching in big games. Not only did he fit from a talent standpoint, but a makeup standpoint. He loves to pitch and loves to compete. He’s not scared of the big moment, and we’re very excited to have him.”


  Although Minasian didn’t state it outright, the Angels could be in position to make significant gains this month because of wealthy owner Arte Moreno’s willingness to spend money in what could be a depressed free agent market due to many teams’ lost revenue from the Coronavirus pandemic. Moreno said last month that the Angels’ payroll won’t go down this season as he attempts to earn the club’s first playoff victory since 2009.


  One week after acquiring veteran shortstop José Iglesias from Baltimore, Minasian added one of the most effective closers of the last half-decade. Both Cuban players are in the final year of their contracts, but that didn’t scare off the Halos.


  “They’ve been productive players over the course of their careers,” Minasian said of his two recent acquisitions. “You’d love to have more control over two players of this quality, but currently they have one year left and we’re going to see where that goes. Who knows? Maybe down the road, they’re here for a lot longer.”


  Raisel Iglesias is one of just five major league relievers with at least 100 saves over the past four seasons along with Edwin Diaz, Kenley Jansen, Brad Hand and Alex Colome.

You and joining me now is the mayor of Billings Montana bill called Mayer called thank you so much for being here with us this morning. We just saw some of those heartbreaking stories out of a hospital in your city you heard not gotten in mentioned some hospitals are functioning at 200%. Capacity. And what is your biggest concern right now. Why it is three. Capacity of our hospital we house. Two. The largest hospitals in months yeah. And made up a lot of super euros and sir mess story. Russia has and this concern is will they be only keep up with the to man. The good news here is that they're dealing with a surge really stepped us great reports Thanksgiving. Yes they're seeing the most difficult times right the good news is our numbers over the last two weeks actually decline. So are hoping that they're gonna get some only. They've been able to prove that capacity as you've reported by taking their free cogan capacity and just. Adding more rooms putting to people in a row ends working very very hard. So I guess my question is what helped. Do you need right now they're in Billings what would make a difference for you guys right now. Well of course. Behavior. We were very lucky we're. Dark place and tell are never started come down but we got to. We are I think a lot cocky. You get through the spring and summer we had a very easy. Ends that made it too easy so what on this surge in this week do it took us awhile to Apple's kind of personal experiences. To change people's behavior. Now. Everybody knows somebody who's been hospitalized or who has died of code of nineteen I have a native American friends who told me the other day that he's had four all aunts and uncles succumb to the disease. And that is changing behavior sharks that's on top of the list but then we also gained two roll up our vaccine and prepare for. The vaccine we got news for governor yesterday that we'll have 9750. And delivered next week assuming the visor vaccine he is. Approved were raking plans to rule that out officially. I'm curious what your telling residents to G to stop the spread right now especially because we are in the middle of this holiday season and and Chanukah and Christmas just around the corner. Yeah well it is to Wear that mask and social distance wash their hands all the things that have been repeated around the country and end around the world looks so is that it's starting to make some difference. Afterward our twelve days out from Thanksgiving and we're yet to see abundant significant surge from Thanksgiving. Now we're not out of the woods yet we've still got a few days left but we've got her fingers crossed. But who are concerned it's people might become complacent again and going in should colder weather and our Christmas season we do not to. This is not the time for complacency we have since double down with all those protections. Montana's had a mass mandate for months now that the case is that you mention are still high a EU also kind of made reference that I think people got a little cocky because you guys stared pretty well through this surges in the spring in the summer are people now following that mandate and social distance seeing. And what it kind of impact have you seen. Sense that mandate was put in place. They are much better than they were before again I think one of the sad things about this diseases you have to see it firsthand forward to release I strike home. And it's. It is a delicate balancing risk and every stage ahead first and foremost. For our. Lives and our health but also to livelihoods. And our act as economy. So people haven't gotten better but we can still do better. You mentioned this a vaccine is coming all eyes have been waiting and watching for this than Montana public Health Department as you said. Hasn't this is expecting more than 9700 Pfizer vaccines by December 15 but there's a lot of skepticism. Out there about the vaccine. Do list sense. And if you're residents will actually take the vaccine do they trust it works in and safety. And Ken how are you guys preparing for all of that. I am not hearing concerns about the the vaccine itself I think you are probable be a lack. Who thought supply. Not a lack of demand. 9700. Doses will not go very far we will prioritize first the health cure. Workers. Along in the trenches. And also residents of long term care facilities. But that's just not enough doses who we are the largest city. In Montana and largest city within 500 miles and we. After share not just for our own residents but those hospitals are full of people from northern Wyoming all over Montana and the western Dakotas so at any given time our hospitals have about 50% residents and about 50% from outside of our county. Enemies we need to get that he the vaccine out one of the things were working on is how to make them available at multiple locations. We may open up our fire stations for example news paramedics. Pharmacies. Course that is health clinics. We just hope that there's something. There's enough vaccines left for a Montana sometimes. We're at the end of the road. And it doesn't seem like we get to and all the support that we need. That was certainly the cheese with that testing we certainly have we just haven't had enough testing chest. I'm to do surveillance testing and that's hurt our ability to do contact tracing and tamp down on the spread of the disease. And that is something that Al lot of states an area in rural areas are saying that same issue. Mayor bill Cole thank you so much for being with us we really appreciate you this morning. Even as great to be with you and stay safe use wound.

The Open Society Justice Initiative filed an amicus brief in the case, citing the urgent need to decriminalize vagrancy laws in light of the COVID-19 pandemic because the laws over-incarcerate poor and marginalized people, putting them at greater risk of contracting the virus.


  “It is in the interest of African states to implement this advisory opinion by repealing all vagrancy laws, which reinforce structural discrimination and penalize poverty,” said Stanley Ibe, associate legal officer for Africa at the Open Society Justice Initiative. “Since vagrancy laws contribute to dangerously overcrowded prisons, a hotbed of COVID-19, failing to do so could have disastrous consequences.”


  British, French, Portuguese, Dutch, and Belgian colonists used vagrancy laws to control the streets. They were intentionally broad and vaguely defined, giving law enforcement wide discretion to arrest and detain just about anyone.

Third Day Worship Centre in Kingston has confirmed that it is the "place of worship" local public health is linking to 24 cases of COVID-19.
 In a video news conference call on Monday, the Kingston region's medical officer of health described nine cases linked to a local church, which then infected 15 close contacts.
 Kingston, Frontenac and Lennox and Addington Public Health did not identify the church, but in a written statement provided to the Whig-Standard on Tuesday morning, Third Day Worship Centre said a member of its congregation who was infected with COVID-19 had attended a church service on Nov. 29, and that after it learned this information, the church "immediately contacted KFL&A Public Health to report and contain.”
 The service on Nov. 29 was one that raised some controversy after TJ Malcangi, a visiting speaker from Montreal, promoted Third Day Worship Centre on his personal social media account as a location for churchgoers in zones experiencing COVID-19 lockdowns to visit.
 “If you’re in Toronto and your church shut down, this one is less than (three) hours away!” the social media post by Malcangi read.
 At the time of the controversy, Kingston Police reached out to the church to “talk about possible concerns” but told the Whig-Standard later in an email that the church “seemed to be following the guidelines” and that the church’s website was clear about its COVID-19 rules.
 “Their effort to bring parishioners in from a hot zone may have been viewed unfavourably, however, upon speaking with supervisors did not appear to (be) breaking any rules,” an email from police said.
 A Third Day spokesperson said in the written statement on Tuesday that it has appreciated local public health’s guidance and that it is working closely with the health unit.
 “All individuals that have tested positive are self-isolating at home,” the statement said. “Individuals deemed to be at high risk were and continue to be in communication with KFL&A Public Health.”
 The church has since moved its services online, “in the interest of protecting our congregation from further spread.”
 “We also closed our offices immediately, disinfected and sanitized the church and hope members of the church and region at large have a safe recovery,” the written statement said.
 In a videotaped sermon posted to the church's Facebook page on Dec. 6, pastor Francis Armstrong said the church would continue with virtual services for the coming weeks, with hopes to gather in person on Dec. 20.
 "I know it's different when you're used to being in church … but everything about this year has been so, so different," he said in the video.
 Dr. Kieran Moore, medical officer of health for the region, said during the video news conference on Monday that a person in their 80s who recently tested positive for the virus is suspected to have become infected at a “place of worship,” but he did not specify if that case was linked to the cases at Third Day.
 “We’re asking anyone that’s elderly that has any chronic disease to reconsider going in person to places of worship, to potentially consider using virtual services to keep connected on a faith base. Over this next four to six weeks, where we’re seeing increased activity, (they’re asked) to try not to go into any closed spaces and crowded places where there’s close faces.”
 Avoiding large public gatherings like church services is important right now, especially for the elderly and chronically ill, Moore said.
 “Despite best practices, there’s always a risk of transmission, even in places of worship,” he said. “We’re very sensitive to the impact of this virus on those that are the most vulnerable, and I think those are reasonable suggestions over the next four to six weeks, and potentially extended until we have a vaccine to best protect the elderly.”

For other teams around the league, though, there are reportedly some reservations about trading for Harden as they would want to know that the perennial All-Star would stick around long term, and not opt out of his contract after the 2021-22 season.
 For the time being, no trade seems to be imminent for Harden, and the Rockets are in no rush to deal their franchise centerpiece without the right price. After trading Russell Westbrook for John Wall, and signing young center Christian Wood to a contract during the offseason, the Rockets are clearly sending the message that they aren't interested in going into a full rebuild. The asking price for Westbrook also indicates that Houston wants to be competitive and not build through the draft.

The increase of 177 deaths didn’t equate to an increase in every county. In Franklin County, the total number of deaths decreased from 21 on Tuesday morning to 16 on Tuesday evening. Grundy County dropped from 14 to 11, and Butler County saw a decline from 12 to 8. Hamilton County increased by two deaths, from 13 to 15.


  The state has not explained why some deaths were removed from counties’ total as a result of the change in methodology.


  The difference between the way the State of Iowa has been counting COVID-19 deaths, and the deaths it was reporting to the CDC has been noted and questioned. Laura Belin at the Bleeding Heartland blog reported on the discrepancy two weeks ago, noting that the state’s report to the federal government did not match the numbers it publishes at coronavirus.iowa.gov.


  The state also noted that the new coding takes approximately seven days to complete and return to the state, which will increase the time between when a death is reported to the state and the date it will be published on the state’s coronavirus website.

It's already been a tremendous season on the football field for the Inland Lakes Bulldogs.
   
 While their MHSAA 8-Player Division 1 state semifinal matchup at Suttons Bay hasn't been played just yet, some of the Bulldogs -- both players and coaches -- are getting much-deserved accolades for their contributions on the gridiron.
   
 A total of five Inland Lakes players and coaches were recently named to the Michigan High School Football Coaches Association's (MHSFCA) 8-Player All- Region team.
   
 Leading the way on the offensive side was junior quarterback Mason Blumke, who has passed for 603 yards and seven touchdowns and added 433 rushing yards and seven touchdowns this season.
   
 Joining Blumke on the All-Region squad was senior running back Beau Vizina, who has rushed for 1,037 yards and scored 12 touchdowns.
   
 Helping protect Blumke and create holes for Vizina to run through all season long has been senior offensive lineman Joey Foldenauer, who also earned a spot on the All-Region team.
   
 On the defensive side, senior defensive back Derick Armstrong -- a player with 45 total tackles, nine tackles for loss, two interceptions and five fumble recoveries -- secured his spot on the team.
   
 Rounding out Inland Lakes was head coach Travis Meyer, who helped guide the Bulldogs to their first-ever regional football championship. Meyer was one of two coaches to earn the 8-Player Division 1 Regional Coach of the Year honor.
   
 After a winless first campaign, things have taken off in Year 2 for Meyer, who has the Bulldogs currently at 8-1 on the season, including three postseason victories.
   
 The Pellston Hornets had three players and one coach make the All-Region team following an impressive 7-1 campaign.
   
 Offensively, junior quarterback Isaiah Crawford led the Hornets on the All- Region squad. During his campaign, Crawford threw for 803 yards and 12 touchdowns and rushed for 434 yards and eight touchdowns.
   
 Senior wide receiver Ian Reimann made the squad after recording 390 receiving yards and six touchdowns in his final season with the program.
   
 On special teams, speedy kickoff and punt returner Nathan Chiles joined his teammates on the team. Chiles, a junior, returned two kickoffs and two punts this season. Offensively, Chiles contributed with 406 rushing yards and five touchdowns.
   
 The other coach to earn Regional Coach of the Year honors was Pellston head coach Jack Carter, who guided the Hornets to a 7-1 record in his fourth season.
   
 In addition to earning a share of the Ski Valley Conference 8-Player championship, Carter also guided Pellston to its first-ever playoff victory after a win over Brimley at home in later October.

 Farmers are protesting against laws that deregulate the sale of crops, allowing private buyers more free rein in a marketplace that has long been dominated by government subsidies. Farmers say the reforms to laws that have long protected small landholders' place in the market will put them at risk of losing their businesses and land to big corporations.

Mesmo apos uma primeira analise dos dados dos testes clinicos da vacina desenvolvida pela Universidade de Oxford em parceria com a AstraZeneca, a eficacia do imunizante entre idosos, um dos grupos de maior risco para covid, nao pode ser avaliada e so sera conhecida depois de novas analises, segundo disseram os autores da pesquisa em artigo publicado nesta terça-feira, 8, no periodico cientifico The Lancet.
 O texto confirma os resultados de eficacia divulgados anteriormente pela AstraZeneca (de 62% entre o grupo de voluntarios que recebeu duas doses completas e de 90% entre aqueles que receberam meia dose seguida de uma dose completa), mas ressalta que o numero de voluntarios mais velhos e muito pequeno para aferir a eficacia entre idosos.
 Na analise de eficacia, os pesquisadores avaliaram a distribuiçao de 131 infecçoes entre os grupos placebo e vacinados, mas somente cinco desses contaminados tinham mais de 55 anos, o que tornou impossivel uma analise estatisticamente significativa entre os mais velhos. "A eficacia da vacina em grupos de idades mais avançada nao pode ser avaliada, pois havia poucos casos. Os autores afirmam que esta analise sera concluida no futuro", informa nota do The Lancet divulgada para a imprensa.
 De acordo com Merryn Voysey, um dos autores do artigo, a insuficiencia de dados entre idosos ocorreu porque o recrutamento de pessoas maiores de 55 anos começou mais tarde.
 "Para avaliar a eficacia da vacina, precisamos ter um numero suficiente de casos de covid-19 entre os participantes para indicar que a vacina os esta protegendo contra doenças. Como o recrutamento de adultos mais velhos começou mais tarde do que em adultos mais jovens, houve menos tempo de acompanhamento para essas coortes e menos tempo para acumular casos de covid-19. Isso significa que temos que esperar mais para ter dados suficientes para fornecer boas estimativas de eficacia da vacina em subgrupos menores", afirmou o cientista.
 A conclusao pode atrapalhar os planos do Ministerio da Saude de iniciar a vacinaçao no Pais entre profissionais de saude e idosos. Ate esta segunda- feira, 7, a principal aposta do governo brasileiro era a vacina de Oxford por causa de um acordo ja firmado de fornecimento de 100 milhoes de doses.
 Segundo o cronograma apresentado na semana passada pelo ministerio, a vacinaçao começaria em março com profissionais de saude e idosos a partir dos 75 anos e seria gradualmente ampliada para idosos de outras faixas etarias. A estimativa do ministerio era imunizar quase 30 milhoes de idosos nas primeiras fases da campanha.

 # Sheriff's Office, Workforce Center receive more funding in 2021 Fairfield Co. budget
 Logan Weaver
 Lancaster Eagle-Gazette
 View Comments
 LANCASTER - The Fairfield County Commission voted Tuesday to approve the county's $183 million budget for 2021.
 The county's general fund budget will increase to $50.6 million in 2021, up 1.6% from the 2020 budget which was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.
 Commissioner Steve Davis acknowledged that while the county seems to be doing well financially, emergency situations and incidents like the pandemic can still have a huge impact on budgets.
 "The biggest issue for folks both within and outside county government, looking at the budget and, locally, the financial situation in the county, is the cash situation which appears, on paper, to be very strong," Davis said. "I'm just going to continue and reiterate the need to be real careful with that in this low-visibility situation where we don't know what's around the corner."
 The largest expenditure for the county's general fund will be the Sheriff's Office — $17 million - nearly one-third of the general fund budget - will go toward the FCSO and jail operations. That number is a $330,000 increase from 2020.
 In a media release, Davis said this funding lines-up with the county's priority of supporting local law enforcement.
 "We are prepared to include additional expenditures for the Sheriff’s Office, such as for the creation of a training and firing range, as well, once identified," Davis said.
 The Sheriff's Office isn't the only ones seeing an increase in funding next year. The Workforce Center will receive an additional $316,000 in 2021, with the extra funds going toward equipment and assumption of debt. Another $300,000 will go toward energy conservation project debt estimates.
 Davis said the county will need to be prepared to make major purchases and upgrade technology within county offices.
 "Our technology has not been very well-invested into," Davis said. "We need to make some pretty large expenditures in that regard."
 Davis added that upgrading technology would help in recruiting new workers to county agencies.
 Sales tax is expected to be the largest source of revenue at $23 million estimated for 2021, according to the media release. In fact, the county expects a three-percent increase in sales tax revenue next year.

Some of the measures, such as the shuttering of bars, are unpleasant but hard to argue against from a public health perspective. But others seem arbitrary, to say the least, smacking more of panic than carefully thought-through public policy. Why, for example, should a restaurateur who has spent tens of thousands of dollars retrofitting his or her establishment to meet previous safety mandates for outdoor dining suddenly have to shut down because hundreds of miles away, but within the same large region, Covid rates are spiking? Why should a person who is masked and keeping to social-distancing protocols not even be allowed to sit outside, ten feet apart from a friend who doesn’t live in her household? California’s new diktats sound tough—they present an image of an in-charge governor—but in reality they are unlikely to significantly lower transmission rates, while being very likely to inflict irreparable economic and mental health damage the longer they continue.

NEW YORK (AP) — Steven Soderbergh calls it “the boat movie” even though he’s not supposed to call it “the boat movie.”
 The Queen Mary 2, on which Soderbergh filmed the majority of his new film “Let Them All Talk,” is technically a ship, and a big one at that. The thought of making a movie on the $750-million ocean liner, during an eight-day Transatlantic crossing from New York to South Hampton, U.K., tickled Soderbergh, a filmmaker who hunts quicker, less plodding methods of making movies the way some seek other shores.
 If there were any doubt, Soderbergh is not a cruise guy. But despite — or maybe because of — his proficiency as a filmmaker, he likes to put himself at sea, with new problems to navigate. He shot much of “Let Them All Talk” while rolling around the decks in a wheelchair, with a camera in his lap.
 The film, written by the acclaimed short-story writer Deborah Eisenberg (at 75, her first screenplay), stars Meryl Streep as an author traveling to receive an award, who brings along two friends (Dianne Wiest, Candice Bergen) and her nephew (Lucas Hedges). As a travel setting now associated with outbreaks from the beginning of the pandemic, Soderbergh calls his film, on HBO Max on Friday, “from the before times.”
 That’s something Soderbergh, as the maker of “Contagion,” knows about, too. In an interview by phone, he spoke about that prophetic 2011 film, leading Hollywood’s return to production and the future of the movie industry post- pandemic. Answers have been edited for length and clarity.

Owner of Canal View Cafe in Resolven, Emma Hughes said she felt the high figures there were down to the area's "close-knit community".


  She explained: "It has gone so quiet. People are afraid to come out, even with measures like distancing in place. It's been like that for a while.


  "We're going to stay open until December 20. I've made the decision I'm going to do this week to get rid of the stock we have and then we'll close until the new year.


  "I think the statistics we're hearing about are concerning for people. The customers who do come in are our regulars, but I know a lot are self- isolating. It is getting worrying, it is close to home. I would shut tomorrow but I am staying open to keep the staff in work.


  "I think the reason it is so high here is that we are a close knit community. If one person has got it, it can spread very quickly. I know a lot of it is coming from the schools. Maybe it's the teenagers who like to go out. I think I will keep my children off school now.


  "Nobody wants to self isolate but we are such a close-knit unit, if one or two people have it it can spread like wildfire. We're just trying to get through the next two weeks before we can just go home and put Christmas films on."

“Experts estimate that at least 20,000 people sentenced to prison from LA County are serving sentences far longer than they would receive under the charging policies I announced today,” Gascon said, putting that total at one- fifth of the state’s prison population.


  “Punishment must be proportional and in the community’s best interest,” he said during remarks livestreamed after his swearing-in ceremony.


  Gascon said he will prioritize individuals for resentencing who have already served excessive sentences, are convicted of non-violent crimes, are deemed low-risk for release and those who are especially at risk for COVID-19.


  While it’s not clear how he plans to pay for such a massive undertaking, Gascon contends that the work will ultimately save taxpayers money.


  “It will also save California taxpayers billions of dollars,” Gascon said. “Billions of taxpayer resources that can be put back into our communities, into public health, housing and education — the solutions that actually enhance long-term health and safety for our community.”


  He said the process will include input from victims.


  Anyone sentenced to prison as a child will also be on that priority list, Gascon said, after pledging that his prosecutors will no longer seek to try minors as adults, effective immediately.


  Even more work is ahead for local prosecutors, as Gascon said attorneys for any defendant behind bars awaiting trial for a misdemeanor or non-serious, non-violent felony charge could immediately request a hearing to revisit bail. The new D.A. said his office would not contest such requests for release, which he anticipated would involve hundreds of people.


  “Our system of money bail is as unsafe as it is unjust,” Gascon said, “How much money you have in your bank account is a terrible proxy for dangerousness.”


  He promised that his office would also present a plan by January to eliminate cash bail.


  “It will reinvigorate the presumption of innocence in LA County,” he said.


  Gascon’s election marks the beginning of a new era after Jackie Lacey’s eight-year tenure. He began his remarks talking about his first law enforcement job.


  “It was 40 years ago that I walked my first beat as a young Los Angeles police officer. I still remember to this day the first day that I put a uniform on. I was so proud,” Gascon recalled.


  But over his career as an officer, he said he found himself arresting young men who looked familiar to him, because he had taken their father or uncle or brother into custody years earlier.


  “How, with all the resources that we pour into arresting, prosecuting and incarcerating, how do we fail multiple generations of the same families?” Gascon said, noting that the “phenomenon was visited exclusively on these disadvantaged communities.”


  The answer, he said, is that “America is addicted to drugs” across racial lines but “the painful truth is that the disadvantaged kids that get caught tend to go to juvenile hall, while kids in wealthier communities tend to go to rehab.”


  Putting kids in detention perpetuates a cycle that does not promote public safety, but increases the likelihood that they will commit more crimes, he said.


  The new district attorney pointed again and again to racial inequities in the criminal justice system.

 HILLSDALE -- A 22-year-old Hillsdale man on parole for a previous conviction of breaking-and-entering with intent to commit larceny is back behind bars following a police pursuit Dec. 3 that reached a speed of more than 100 mph.
 Arraignment was held Monday for Cordell Jarrod Austin in 2B District Court before Judge Sara S. Lisznyai on felony allegations of fourth-degree fleeing/eluding police and unlawfully driving away an automobile.
 Not only was Austin on parole at the time of the two new allegations, he was on bond through Lisznyai's court pending sentencing on a previous conviction of attempted unlawfully driving away of an automobile.
 Lisznyai said Monday that Austin was supposed to be in a treatment facility for substance abuse issues at the time.
 Although Austin's fate with Michigan Department of Corrections is unknown due to his parole status, Lisznyai sentenced him to 150 days in the Hillsdale County jail, with credit for 27 days served in the attempted auto theft case. He also will pay $425 in fines and costs.
 On the two new charges, Austin will be held without bond and next appear in the district court Dec. 23 for a probable cause conference.
 The pursuit Dec. 3 was initiated by the Michigan State Police in Pittsford Township and worked its way to U.S. 127, where Austin turned south toward Ohio and reached a speed of around 110 mph. The pursuing trooper was ordered to terminate the pursuit at the state line, but Williams County, Ohio, authorities managed to apprehend Austin near West Unity, Ohio.
 Austin was extradited to Michigan to answer for the criminal charges.
 Lisznyai said Monday that Austin has committed seven offenses since 2016, when he legally became an adult.

The vaccine can’t arrive soon enough for the U.K., where more than 61,000 people have died in the pandemic — more than any other country in Europe, according to data tallied by Johns Hopkins University. The U.K. has recorded more than 1.7 million confirmed cases of the virus.


  The vaccine, however, remains experimental. While it seems to prevent people from getting sick, it is still unclear how long that protection lasts.


  The 800,000 doses Britain has received so far are only a fraction of what is needed. The government is targeting more than 25 million people, or about 40% of the population, in the first phase of its vaccination program, which gives first priority to those who are highest risk from the disease.


  Stephen Powis, medical director for the National Health Service in England, said the first shot was an emotional moment.


  “This really feels like the beginning of the end,″ he said. “It’s been really dreadful year, 2020 — all those things that we are so used to, meeting friends and family, going to the cinema, have been disrupted. We can get those back. Not tomorrow. Not next week. Not next month. But in the months to come.″


  The vaccination program will be expanded as the supply increases, with the vaccine offered roughly on the basis of age groups, starting with the oldest people. Britain plans to offer COVID-19 vaccines to everyone over the age of 50, as well as younger adults with health conditions that put them at greater risk from the virus.


  In England, the vaccine will be delivered at 50 hospital hubs in the first wave of the program, with more hospitals expected to offer it as the rollout ramps up. Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales are making their own plans under the U.K.’s system of devolved administration.


  Logistical issues are slowing the distribution of the Pfizer vaccine because it has to be stored at minus-70 degrees Celsius (minus-94 degrees Fahrenheit). Authorities also are focusing on large-scale distribution points because each package of vaccine contains 975 doses and they don’t want any to be wasted.


  The U.K. has agreed to buy more than 350 million doses of vaccine from seven different producers. Governments around the world are making agreements with multiple developers to ensure they lock in delivery of the products that are ultimately approved for widespread use.


  All of those logistical challenges culminated in nurse May Parsons inserting a syringe into Keenan’s left shoulder and depressing the plunger to deliver the vaccine. Parsons, originally from the Philippines, has worked for the NHS for the past 24 years.

It’s been almost nine months since the pandemic started, and at this point I’ve gotten used to missing things, people, and places that I once took for granted — my favorite ramen spot, which closed for good in March; my local AMC; even my old office. But most of all, I miss lesbian bars.


  Though I came out as bisexual at 17, the first time I visited a lesbian bar was after I graduated from college, when I moved to New York City for an internship. Like most people, I had a ton of things I was excited to do once I arrived. But before visiting classic tourist attractions like the Empire State Building or Central Park, I wanted to go to a lesbian bar. I was hoping to find a place for myself in the queer community, somewhere I could feel at home.


  Advertisement


  Of the 2,100 drinking holes in NYC, by the time I arrived, only three were lesbian bars: Cubbyhole, Henrietta Hudson (both in the West Village), and Ginger’s Bar (in Brooklyn). My first weekend in the city, I decided to go to Henrietta’s, which, frankly, is not what comes to mind when you picture a must-see NYC venue. It’s a small dive bar with a few seats, cheap drinks, and a tiny dance floor that gets way too crowded on weekends. I was thrilled to be there.


  I didn’t know anyone in the city yet, so I went to Henrietta’s by myself. I scored a seat at the bar, and sat there feeling awkward for a few minutes. The sense of loneliness didn’t last long, though. As the bar started to slowly fill up, I suddenly realized that I was surrounded by more queer women than I had ever encountered in my four years in college, which was an experience in itself. I didn’t know them personally, but if I turned to anyone to tell them about my experiences with other women, they would likely be able to relate. Historically, queer bars have been one of the few places where queer people are free to truly be themselves, so most come with a real sense of camaraderie. In fact, soon after I sat down a group of women invited me to join their game of Jenga. I met the people who would become my closest NYC friends that night, and almost every time we went out, we made sure to start or end the night either there, or at Cubbyhole or Ginger’s. But even when I went to a lesbian bar alone, I never felt lonely.

  The strong sense of community and belonging that I felt in lesbian bars was something I’d been searching for since I came out. My coming out story was fairly straightforward and conflict-free — after having crushes on both girls and guys throughout my life, I finally realized I was bisexual my junior year of high school. Most people around me were pretty okay with it, and a couple months later I started dating a woman for the first time. Though she ultimately decided to go back into the closet and dismiss the months we spent together as “confusion," which was incredibly hurtful to me, the relationship did make it easier for me to get comfortable in my orientation. Feeling at peace, however, didn’t equal feeling at home.


  When I headed off to college in Syracuse, I was certain I could find the supportive queer community I always dreamt of. A couple months into freshman year, though, I realized I had been too optimistic. My public communications program in college consisted of mostly straight, cisgendered people, and while I did not face outward homophobia, whenever I mentioned attraction toward another woman I was mostly met with uncomfortable silence. The queer community in Syracuse outside of the school was extremely small and consisted of older women who mostly grew up together, so it felt out of reach to me. I craved the presence of people who shared my experience as a queer woman, but had no idea where they were. Finding a new queer relationship was also out of the question — how was I supposed to meet a woman I’d like to date when I couldn’t even find queer friends?

  Lesbian bars offered a kind of salvation. In them, I found the community I’d been searching for. As a single woman who hates dating apps, they also became a safe place for me to find  potential dates. When I ask someone out at a lesbian bar, the worst that can happen is they say  they’re not interested. If I tried to approach a woman at a place that does not primarily serve queer people, I’d have to do so without knowing if she’s queer, and without knowing if she’s homophobic. The risk of the encounter potentially turning violent was something that kept me from approaching other women with ease since I came out, and lesbian bars were the only places where I could put that worry to rest. I preferred to have most of my first dates in lesbian bars for the same reason. First dates are stressful enough as is without having to wonder, “Are the people over there staring because they think we’re cute, or am I about to be hate-crimed?”


  I haven’t been to Henrietta’s, or any other lesbian bar, since March 2020, when restaurants began shutting down in New York City due to the pandemic. And I fear for their future. The last couple of decades had already been hard on lesbian bars; their numbers dwindled from around 200 in 1980 to only 15 in 2020, according to The Lesbian Bar Project’s website. Between 2007 and 2019, nearly 52 percent of bars catering to queer women closed their doors, research conducted by Oberlin College professor Greggor Mattson, PhD, showed. There is still no knowing when the pandemic will end, and by then these numbers might even be smaller. The places where I first felt like a true part of the queer community could be gone forever.

  Resilience is an inherent part of the queer experience, so it’s not a surprise that lesbian bars have been fighting to stay afloat via fundraisers, virtual events, and selling merch. There’s no knowing if these measures will be enough, but I’m desperately hoping that they will be. I spent most my life feeling like I was out of place, and lesbian bars are one of the few places where I feel I belong. To be able to sit in a place that is for and owned by queer women like myself is a profound experience. Going to these lesbian bars and being surrounded by other queer people, having conversations, making connections, or even just existing there has been incredibly validating and has helped me feel truly at home in my own orientation and desires. I hope that when the pandemic is over, I will still be able to head to Henrietta’s on a Thursday, oldies night. Eighties hip-hop will be playing. I’ll find the last seat at the already-cramped bar, order myself a cheap vodka-soda, and I will feel like I’m home.

Trump is clearly of two minds. He can’t admit that he lost Georgia and will endorse any lunatic theory to explain away his defeat. At the same time, he knows his political legacy is caught up in the outcome of the Senate races.


  So, he attacks the top Republicans in the state at the same time he promotes Perdue and Loeffler.


  Nothing will ever be enough to satisfy him and his allies about the Georgia vote. The other day, Trump pounded Kemp for not matching absentee ballots with their envelopes and checking their signatures. But the signatures were checked twice already.


  In Georgia, first, the signature on an absentee ballot request is checked against the voter registration card. Then, when the ballot is sent in, the signature on the envelope is checked against both the ballot request and the voter registration card.


  When Wood and Powell were asked at their Wednesday rally about the hand recount that should have put to bed the Dominion theory, Powell denied there was a full hand recount and said, regardless, Georgia’s election system is built to skew recounts, too.


  One can only conclude that if Georgia allowed Wood and Powell to choose a team of forensic scientists to inspect ballots in a hermetically sealed examination room guarded by Navy SEALs, they’d still come up with a reason why the count had been subverted if it showed Biden ahead.


  Perhaps Republican voters will ignore all of this come January. But there’s a reason parties seek unity before important elections.


  At best, Wood-Powell are distracting from the GOP message in the races and, at worst, convincing persuadable Georgians that it is the Republican Party that needs to be checked, not Joe Biden.


  Certainly, the Wood-Powell logic supports sitting this one out. There’s no reason to bother voting if Georgia is controlled by politicians on the take who use technology to predetermine the outcome of elections.


  Who needs actual agents of the DNC if this is what the most fervent allies of Donald Trump are saying?
