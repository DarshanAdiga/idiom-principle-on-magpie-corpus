The power outage also affects the people living in the Operation Peace Spring region negatively as the regime and the YPG terrorist organization are constantly cutting the energy coming to the area. Since the damage on the lines has never been repaired, people cannot benefit sufficiently even on days with electricity. This negatively affects both the farmer who irrigates with pumps and the people living in the city.

Earlier this year, YPG terrorists also spread propaganda against Turkey&#39;s Operation Peace Spring in northern Syria.

While the style, colors and fabric used may vary throughout the country, “yazma,” which in Turkish literally means “writing,” is a type of fabric that is either hand-painted or block-printed using a carved wooden mold. Each province produces unique designs and styles of yazma, utilizing different fabrics and colors, but the most famous are the black designs printed on white or colored cotton from Tokat, the bright yellow fabric printed with blue, red and green designs from Kastamonu and silk variations from Bursa to name just a few. These fabrics are used in multiple ways spanning from stylish summer dresses and traditional baggy şalvar pants to most commonly as a headscarf in which the edges are embellished with a trim of hand-embroidered lace, referred to as “el oyası” and is a beautiful art in its own right. Yazmas are regularly available at local weekly bazaars and all types of fabric stores.

At least 380 kilowatts of energy are required for the pumps to operate at sufficient capacity and the regime provides the highest 330-kilowatt energy to the facility. The low voltage, which is clearly evident in the indicators, reveals the regime&#39;s lies.

The province of Denizli has a legacy of weaving pure cotton fabrics that spans back nearly 4,000 years as the recent archaeological uncovering of a textile factory has proven. Coincidently; the province’s most famous natural site is referred to in Turkish as Pamukkale, which translates to “Cotton Castle.” While the site, which consists of visually spectacular mineral-laden thermal travertine terraces, does not directly correlate to cotton fabric per se, the neighboring ancient Roman spa city of Hierapolis dating back to the second century B.C. coupled with the fact that the area was known to boast superior weavers as mentioned by 14th-century Muslim traveler Ibn Batuta can attest to what could be considered the ultimate bathing textiles in the world. Woven out of thick cotton yarn, the peshtamels and towels traditionally used in the Turkish bathing ceremony are all examples of “Denizli dokuması” (the Denizli weave). These fabrics are known for being moisture absorbent and breathable and come in an array of colors obtained from natural dying methods using walnut leaves, onion skins, sumac and acorns as well as many other herbal, root and plant sources.

An impressive addition to Turkey’s legacy with textiles comes in the form of suzani, which is a type of colorfully decorative embroidered textile that arrived in Turkey via the Turkic nomadic tribes of Central Asian countries such as Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan and Tajikistan. The name of the textile is derived from the Persian word for needle, which is &quot;suzan&quot; and attributes to the wonderful symbolic, circular designs in rich colors that were traditionally embroidered by brides as part of their dowry. Some of the most prevalent designs on suzanis, which are mainly made out of cotton or velvet, include the sun and moon, flowers, including Ottoman tulips, birds and fish and fruit such as pomegranates. Officially dating back to the late 18th century but assumed to have started much earlier, antique suzanis can be found in flea markets throughout the country and are all over the Grand Bazaar, having been incorporated into a variety of shoe and boot designs as well as handbags. Nurem is a shop that stands out for purchasing the textile itself, which can easily be used on furniture, as a bedspread or wall hanging. The online shop Enjoy Istanbul also has a wide variety of styles and applications that are easy to peruse.",

The electricity used for pumping the water that goes to the regime zone comes from the Tishrin Dam, which is also under regime control. Since the regime reduces the voltage of the electricity coming to the water pump station, there is not enough water pumped for Hassakeh. In an attempt at dark propaganda, the regime claims that Turkey intentionally blocks the flow of the water.

More commonly known as coming from Indonesia and Malaysia due to the fact that the word &quot;ikat&quot; itself is derived from the Malay word &quot;mengikat,&quot; meaning to bind, in this fabric, the threads used to create the design itself are tied together and resist-dyed in a method similar to tie-dye or batik. The difference in the method used for ikat is that the pattern is applied to the threads themselves before the fabric is woven, rather than to the entire piece of fabric. What results is a fabric with a unique and stunning blend of color and patterns, which has become a popular high-end textile used in home furnishings of late. It is one of the oldest forms of textile decoration and has surfaced in many different areas all over the world, including Central Asia and Uzbekistan as well as in the Middle East’s Iran, Syria and Yemen and here in Turkey. Each country has its own distinct style or motifs and the threads, which can vary from cotton and velvet to silk and wool. While you can definitely find ikat textiles and accessories in the Grand Bazaar, such as at the shop Dere Gözü, more upscale applications of the fabric are available at the Mudo Collection home accessories chain and at the designer pillow shop Yastık By Rıfat Özbek in Nişantaşı.
