What makes this story remarkable is how straight and serious the matter is played. These are not maniacal villains or buffoonish incompetents; they are just ordinary people who plan and gather information carefully and execute their plans with as little fuss as possible. No contrivances are required to put the protagonist on the ropes, either; for all his physical toughness and anti-magic ability, Asta's weak point is having no real way to defend himself from non-magical poisonous gas, and they went after Marie when the nun was away. (Bad move, as now they have Gauche highly-motivated.) Noelle simply gets thwarted at first by an older and more experienced person acting faster, though she does at least manage to save Asta from being carried off.

Then the second shoe drops. The pension manager has promised more than it can sustainably deliver. Soon after, the San Rafael Council voted to place Measure R on the ballot, Marin County Employee Retirement Association, which targets a 7% annual return, disclosed that it had achieved only 1.9% in the latest year. That added about $24 million to San Rafael’s unfunded pension liability, equal to six years of Measure R tax revenue. As MCERA has met the 7% target only twice in the past six years, you should expect this to happen again.

"Devine [Ozigbo] had a really good preseason last year when you go back to watch him with the Saints [and that] is why we claimed him. Leonard [Fournette] was healthy for most of last year, that’s why he [Ozigbo] didn’t get a whole lot of action, and plus we had Rock [Ryquell Armstead]," general manager Dave Caldwell said on Saturday.
 If Ozigbo misses more time this week, it could lead to undrafted rookie running back James Robinson seeing an expanded role in the running game on Sunday. Robinson was recently listed as the team's No. 1 running back on the unofficial depth chart.
 While Eifert missing the practice isn't a big deal since it was a scheduled day off, Davis is currently projected to be the No. 3 tight end in an offense that figures to be tight end-heavy. It remains to be seen if Davis will be available for Sunday's game vs. the Colts, but it would leave the Jaguars with just Eifert and James O'Shaughnessy in the event he misses time.
 Luckily for the Jaguars, the team considers this year's tight end group to be among the best they have had in several years, even if there are only a few players at the position on the roster.
 “Tyler Eifert, obviously he’s a veteran, he’s a pro, he’s a former Pro Bowler, but really [he’s a] savvy route runner [that] catches the ball excellent. He’s a good blocker," Caldwell said. "James [O'Shaughnessy] is a guy who’s been really surprising, not because he’s playing well, but because he’s coming off the ACL [injury]. He’s done such a tremendous job in rehab and has not had any setbacks and looks really good out there. James is a good blocker. He’s also a good pass catcher and good route runner.
 "And then Tyler [Davis]’s a little bit of both. Tyler’s still learning to run some routes but he’s a good blocker. He’s a big guy. He’s competitive. So, we feel good about, probably more so than in years past, the group as a whole than what we’ve had really since we lost [former Jaguars TE] Mercedes [Lewis].”

WARREN, Mich. (AP) — Joe Biden used suburban Detroit as a backdrop Wednesday to make a direct appeal to blue-collar workers who might have voted Republican four years ago but now regret it — attempting to rebuild the Democratic “blue wall” that crumbled four years ago and helped catapult Donald Trump to the White House.The former vice president’s first pandemic-era campaign trips beyond his home in Delaware have been to Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan, an indication of how closely Biden’s electoral prospects are tied to winning back those formerly reliably Democratic states.Biden was in Warren, an area whose economy is heavily dependent on the auto industry, and pledged to rewrite tax codes to reward U.S. companies that invest in domestic manufacturing while imposing penalties on those that send jobs to other countries.He noted that a local General Motors transmission plant closed last year despite Trump’s pledges to protect Michigan jobs and added, “I bet the workers around here weren’t all that comforted by Trump’s empty promises.”“Under Donald Trump, Michigan lost auto jobs even before COVID hit,” Biden said. “And what about offshoring? Has Trump delivered on stopping companies from shipping American jobs overseas? You already know the answer to that. Of course not.”Last week, Biden went to Wisconsin and was followed quickly by running mate Kamala Harris, who held her own Labor Day events there. Biden hit Pennsylvania during the holiday and will be back on Friday.Trump is countering with his own trip to Michigan on Thursday and also will be in Pennsylvania himself the following day.Though the Biden campaign often emphasizes that it sees multiple ways to secure the 270 Electoral College votes it needs to win in November, the quickest path runs through Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.“If Biden wins any of them — but particularly any two, with some of the other states that are in play — it’s pretty impossible for Trump to win the Electoral College,” said veteran Democratic strategist Joe Trippi.Biden’s aides believe his focus on the economy and Trump’s handling of the coronavirus will resonate with key voters nationwide but particularly in states like Michigan, which took one of the sharpest hits nationally from the pandemic.The state’s unemployment rate spiked at 24% in April, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. It has since recovered to 8.7%, but Michigan has nearly 414,500 fewer jobs than it did when Trump was inaugurated.Previewing the president’s own trip, the Trump campaign looked to paint Biden as deferential on China, arguing that he cost American industrial workers their jobs. Trump’s allies have long credited his hawkish China stance in 2016 as helping him win the industrial Midwest, which suffered job losses overseas that Trump blamed on Obama-era trade policies.Trump aides have frequently repeated claims about Biden’s ties to Beijing, but that’s proven problematic in light of Trump’s own kind words for China earlier this year in the early days of the pandemic. They have also ignored the Obama-Biden administration’s efforts to save the American automotive industry, based in Michigan, after 2008′s recession.“Joe Biden is going to the state of Michigan to pretend to be a friend and ally to workers in the industrial heartland,” said Steve Cortes, Trump campaign senior adviser, “but he has proven over and over that he is a globalist and a corporatist who, as senator from Delaware, well represented corporate interests over American workers.”Biden, by contrast, stressed the Obama White House’s efforts to revive the auto industry, saying, “President Trump has broken just about every promise he’s made to the American worker.”“He’s failed our economy and our country,” Biden said Wednesday, promising to create a “Made in America” office within the White House Office of Management and Budget to ensure government projects use resources made domestically.Trump supporters maintain that the president has fulfilled his job creation promises and was only temporarily sidetracked by the pandemic. But the jobs numbers show that hiring at factories across the Midwest — including in Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin — began to stall and then decline in the summer of 2019.Trump won Michigan by the narrowest margin of any state in 2016 — fewer than 11,000 votes — and Democrats made huge gains there in the midterms, winning every major statewide office and a handful of congressional seats as well.Indeed, Democrats see reasons for optimism in the party’s gains during the 2018 midterms in all three states, which were powered in part by an exodus of suburban women from the GOP. And they believe that a stronger emphasis on minority turnout — with Harris, the first African-American woman on a major ticket, focused heavily on Black voters in key states — will help Biden make up some of the ground Clinton lost in 2016.“The campaign’s taking it more seriously from the start than national Democrats did four years ago,” said Amy Chapman, who worked as Barack Obama’s Michigan state director in 2008. “They started doing advertising earlier than they did last cycle — last cycle they were only up at the very end — and the ads show what Biden would do, as well as showing a contrast with Trump.”The Biden campaign is heavily outspending the Trump campaign on-air in all three states. Since Biden became the presumptive Democratic nominee in early April, his campaign has spent about $59.8 million to the Trump campaign’s nearly $26.8 million across the states, according to the ad tracking firm Kantar/CMAG. The difference is starkest in Michigan, where the Biden campaign has spent $17.2 million to Trump’s $6.7 million.For future spending, however, the two come about even, with Biden reserving $33.5 million on air and Trump reserving $32.7 million across all three states.After overlapping in Michigan by barely 24 hours, Trump and Biden will both be in Pennsylvania on Friday at a Sept. 11 memorial in Shanksville, the site of the 2001 crash of United Flight 93.Republicans also argue that a robust, in-person field operation in the Midwestern battlegrounds gives them an advantage over Democrats, who are still doing most of their organizing online out of concern for public safety during the pandemic.___Weissert reported from Washington.

The soft-spoken but determined Bizos represented Mandela from his treason trial in 1964 until the former South African president's death in 2013. Bizos is credited with getting Mandela to add the words "if needs be" to his speech from the dock in which he said he was prepared to die for his ideals. The addition was seen as an escape clause, avoiding any impression that Mandela was goading the court to impose the death penalty.

In the past few years, Omar Ayuso has gone from anonymous film student to queer icon, thanks to his portrayal of Omar Shanaa in the racy Netflix drama _Elite_. The Spanish production follows the lives of three working-class friends who transfer to a private school and get sucked into the depraved world of its ultra-rich student body. There’s sex, drugs, and yes, murder, but the series, which has been renewed for its fourth season, also grapples with issues of class, gender, and race. Ayuso’s character in particular—a tender and tenacious closeted Muslim—gave the actor, who is openly gay, plenty to chew on, both on and off the screen. “Ultimately, everything you put into a character is yours,” he says. “You can change the context, change the name, change the people you interact with, but in the end, all the love, all the hate, and all the fear you put into a character, it’s the hatred and fear that you have inside.”

MARSHFIELD - As fall beckons, along with the beginning of the NFL season despite the pandemic, semi-professional football has already been underway locally with the Marshfield Hurricanes of the East Coast Football League.
 The Hurricanes played their third game of the season on Sept. 4, defeating the Brockton Bucs to improve to 2-1. It was the third straight dominating defensive performance by the Hurricanes, who have surrendered only one touchdown in three games.
 "The defense has played amazing," Head Coach John Fossetti said.
 The win was preserved with two goal-line stands that kept Brockton out of the end zone. The Hurricanes also picked off five passes, including two by Waltham's Chris O'Connell and one apiece by Leon Barnes (Boston), Jamiel Wilson (Wareham) and Joune Fraser (Fall River), while defensive end James Chinn (Boston) and middle linebacker Pierre Benson (Attleboro) were also outstanding.
 All the scoring came on the game's opening play when Johnny Mims (Boston) returned the kickoff 83 yards for a touchdown.
 The Hurricanes are currently playing their home games at the Union Point Sports Complex in Weymouth as they await approval from the town of Marshfield to play at the high school field. Fossetti said they are following all COVID-19 guidelines, with players wearing masks when not on the field and maintaining social distancing rules. The offense and defense also remain separate on the sidelines, no fans are allowed, and there are regular temperature checks.
 "There is parking around the field [in Weymouth] so fans can sit in their car and watch the game," Fossetti said. "We had about 60 people at one game. But we're doing everything by the book [regarding COVID-19]. We showed the state our protocol and guidelines and got the approval to play. We're doing everything we can to prevent the virus from spreading while still playing football. There are no positives tests in the league so far."
 Their roster includes players from Boston, the South Shore and Cape Cod. Weymouth's Joe Cellini starts at quarterback, while Bridgewater's Chris McNally has averaged 100 yards per game out of the backfield.
 "We will do whatever the defense gives us, but we've been running a lot because I think we have the best line in the league," Fossetti said.
 Opening holes have been guards Chris Horne (Quincy) and Vance Turner (Duxbury), tackles Zach Turner (Quincy) and Dustin Rutko (Barnstable) and center Jonathan Baker (Plymouth).
 The Hurricanes opened the season on Aug. 15 against the defending champion Granite State Destroyers, losing 10-8 to a team that is undefeated and has averaged 36 points per game in its three other wins.
 "They missed a field goal at the end but a roughing-the-kicker penalty gave them another chance. It was a tough loss," Fossetti said. "They scored on a broken play. Otherwise, the defense shut them down."
 In their second game, the Hurricanes crushed the Rhode Island Raiders, 34-7.
 The defense is bolstered across the front by ends Joey Amaral (Marshfield) and Brian Owusu (Worcester), with linebackers Benson, Terrance Gomes (Weymouth), Connor McDermott (East Bridgewater) and David Lake (Carver) providing backup. In the secondary is corner Quan Lovett (Yarmouth) and safeties Fraser and Barnes.
 The regular season is a seven-game schedule, with the potential for three playoff games if the Hurricanes reach the championship. They are back in action on Sept. 12 when they travel to New Hampshire to face the Haverhill Hitmen.

PEORIA -- A week after cutting two fire engines and reducing the fire department by 22 positions, the City Council is expected to discuss new taxes to fund that department as well as the police department.
   
 Reaction to the cuts, made to balance this year's budget which was left in tatters due to the COVID-19 pandemic, was swift and harsh on social media. Many decried the cuts which eliminated one engine from South Peoria and one from Far North Peoria, as short-sighted and dangerous.
   
 The cuts came as City Hall needed to fill a multimillion-dollar budget hole caused by fallen sales taxes, motor fuel taxes and hotel & restaurant taxes. For months, the members around the horseshoe had hoped for some help from the federal government, but that hasn't come.
   
 And there appeared to be no appetite by the council to raise taxes to offset those losses.
   
 Or is there?
   
 The council will discuss two possible taxes -- but no action will be taken on Tuesday.
   
 The first one is known a protection tax. One could be levied to fund the fire department and one could be levied to pay for police operations. The council has the authority to create a property tax rate that would be up to 7.5 cents for every $100 assessed value -- the equivalent of about $31 for a $125,000 home if it's imposed at that rate.
   
 Even though the council can create these taxes without a referendum, it could put the measure on the ballot for an advisory referendum.
   
 If the council wanted to set it at a higher rate, it would require voter approval in a binding referendum. To have the measure on the ballot in February, the council must decide to put it on the ballot by Dec. 7.
   
 Also on the agenda is a discussion of increased property taxes to fund the police and the fire pension funds which are separate items. The city now has a public safety pension fee attached to its sewer bill, but that's set to expire next year.
   
 Even with that fee, city officials say $5.2 million will have to be taken out of the general fund coffers and put towards the pensions. That will grow to $8.8 million in 2022 and $10.6 million in 2023.
   
 "This growth in pension costs is forcing the City to cut services," states a memo to the council.
   
 According to the memo, there is no limit to the amount the city could levy and the council doesn't have to put the measure before voters.
   
 Chuck Grayeb, who represents the 2nd District and has been a vocal advocate for not cutting public safety, said he hadn't heard about the measures before the council packet was released last week.
   
 "I think that our core basic services should be funded out of budget without any special fees or taxes assessed. Our core mission is public safety and we are failing in our mission of providing that to people," he said. "I view these proposals with suspicion. I favor a larger credit line and digging deeper in our reserves during a historic pandemic."
   
 One of his colleagues, Zach Oyler, is also leery.
   
 "I am looking forward to the discussion and maybe getting public feedback, but do not feel that a tax increase is the right direction," he said. "The devil is in the details, and we'll have to have a discussion on how this is worded.
   
 "But I will still vote no when it comes to the actual ballot vote. I will not be supporting a tax increase," he said.

When it comes to lodging, the original social distancing is back.
 Camping and RV sites locally are reporting a decent summer and promising fall numbers as travelers are opting for outdoor activities and more personal lodging space amid COVID-19.
 Barb Krumm, marketing director of Ocean Lakes Family Campground in Myrtle Beach, said there’s been a trend of visiting guests who want to get away to a place that they feel they’re a little more in control of the safety factor.
 “We have seen first-time campers and people new to camping who were looking for one of the rental houses, and people who were renting RVs or just purchasing RVs…,” Krumm said. “And then you see some of the trends where they’re sharing their RVs through the online sites.
 “There’s definitely a trend toward camping. Camping is growing tremendously. In light of COVID-19, even more.”
 According to Ipsos, a global market research company, 46 million Americans indicated in June that they planned to take an RV trip in the next 12 months, which was up from 25 million in 2019.

“Ho sempre ritenuto il dialogo e il confronto – scrive la deputata sul suo profilo facebook – la base del mio agire in politica. Qualche giorno fa ho ricevuto presso il mio domicilio una lettera di alcuni cittadini trapanesi (dai toni non troppo amichevoli) dove mi si rimproverava il fatto di sostenere la proposta relativa alla costituzione del comune autonomo di Misiliscemi. Al di là delle opinioni personali ho scelto di condividere quest’iniziativa in quanto frutto di un processo di partecipazione che, nel rispetto della normativa vigente, ha portato i cittadini di queste contrade ad esprimersi a favore della costituzione del nuovo comune ed in democrazia nessuna opinione sta al di sopra della sovranità popolare. Il mio ufficio è sempre stato aperto a tutti i cittadini che cercano un confronto, ritengo infatti che come deputata della Provincia sia mio obbligo essere a disposizione di tutte e tutti i miei concittadini al di là dell’appartenenza politica. Allo stesso tempo non credo che inviare una lettera anonima in un domicilio privato sia uno strumento di civile confronto. Se qualcuno pensa di intimidirmi o condizionare il mio operato dovrebbe sapere che la libertà è sempre stata la linea guida del mio fare politica”.

You wouldn't think celebrity trainer Jillian Michaels would discourage people from heading to their newly opened gyms. But Michaels tells _Fox Business _that she developed COVID-19 from a brief period of letting her guard down, and cautions people against working out in fitness facilities.
 "I haven't even spoken about this publicly really, and a really close friend of mine gave me COVID several weeks ago," Michaels said. "I'm fortunate to have gone into it being healthy and I was able to get on the other side of it pretty quick. But not everybody is that lucky as we know."
 Michaels admits she's not a doctor, but urges people who are at high risk of getting seriously sick to think twice before heading to a gym.
 "If you are afraid of COVID, you should not go to the gym," she said. "I would love to tell you that's not the case, but the reality is I literally let my guard down for an hour. I had no idea I had it for six days. My friend had no idea she had it."
 We already know that the novel coronavirus spreads more easily in confined spaces, like gyms and restaurants, so experts say that working outside is safest, reported _Runner's World_. According to the Arizona Department of Health and Human Services, exercising in an indoor gym is one of the riskiest things you can do during the pandemic. Of course, wearing a mask and keeping a six-feet distance will help lower your chances of getting sick.
 If you want to play it safe, there are plenty of free at-home workouts that don't require dumbbells or pull up bars--as Jillian points out.
 "You don't need these pieces of equipment to work out at home," she said. "You have your own bodyweight and you can use it in a million different ways literally to get a superior workout."

AMARILLO, Texas (KFDA) - The Amarillo community will expect 30 to 35 new directional signs in the downtown area in 2021.The signs will include dramatic artistic signs that catch the eye of pedestrians walking by.This morning, the downtown Wayfinding project announced they have arrived at a final design for the new directional signage for downtown Amarillo.“It’s a system of signage for downtown to help get people both into downtown and then once they’re there, to show them the attractions and assets that we have available both to tourists and to residents,” said Emily Koller, economic development and neighborhood vitalization manager, City of AmarilloThe signs are primarily monument signs and will be installed on sidewalks all around the downtown area.Some of them will be for vehicular traffic and there will be pedestrian scaled signs and maps.“And so some of them function as both, like the front will be for vehicles and then the back will have photographs and maps and interesting things about Amarillo on them. And, they’re kind of works of art in and of themselves. They’re not just meant to be signs on the sidewalk,” said Koller.The signs are intended to create a sense of artistry.“The design of it is very intentional. It tried to take some of the art deco inspired elements of Amarillo’s downtown architecture, while still being very readable,” said Jason Boyett, chair of public arts and beautification board for the City of Amarillo.The committee agreed on the final sign. The sign will include yellow, grey and the red tag color on the side for the street.The bottom skyline image is the final artwork that will be placed on the signage.“Within a week, we’re expecting there to be a prototype that’s going to be out on the sidewalk, it’s going to be scaled appropriately. And it should be in front of Hodgetown. So you’ll be able to see the kind of life-size install. And that’s sort of the final step in this process. It’s going to be a canvas. And so it’ll be strapped, strapped to like plywood. But it will be the actual size of the sign, that actual final design,” said Koller.The final steps include the final sign off and seeing the life-size sign installed in downtown.“Since the Tears one is paying for it, it’ll be sort of a final approval and authorization. And we expect to have that within the next couple of months,” said Koller.The life-size signs will be placed around attraction sites like Hodegtown and Polk Street, with the expected complete installation by next summer.Copyright 2020 KFDA.

 Amazon
 $179.99
 We check over 130 million products every day for the best prices
 The TUF B550M-Plus Wi-Fi ( _$179.99_) resides in the low-/middle-end of the B550 range. For this price, you’ll get a MicroATX board sporting an 8+2 phase VRM, dual M.2 slots, integrated Intel WiFi 6 and even a USB 3.2 Gen2 Type-C port.
 Several years ago, the Asus TUF series of motherboards meant heavy cladding (Asus often called it armour) for protection, ample features, and a mid-range price point. Fast forward to today and the TUF brand, particularly in the laptop space, has shifted focus to lower-end gamers.
 Things have changed in the motherboard realm as well. Gone is the armor, and we get more of a mainstream SKU at an entry-level price. In B550 form there are three Asus TUF-branded parts, the TUF Gaming B550-Plus, TUF Gaming B550M-Plus and Plus Wi-Fi that we’re looking at here. They include TUF chokes and capacitors, along with a reinforced PCIe slot and ESD protection for the rear IO and LAN.
 In our testing, the B550M-Plus Wi-Fi performed well at stock speeds, easily matching all other B550 results. The only potential outlier was application startup and the Powerpoint tests in PCMark. Outside of that, our gaming results were spot on and power consumption was right about in the middle. On the overclocking side of things, the board was able to reach our lofty 4.3 GHz target and handled our 32GB/3600 RAM kit without issue as well.
 Below, we’ll take a look at the board’s specifications and features, as well as check out performance and power consumption in more detail. First, here’s the board’s full specifications from Asus.

"articleBody": "TOLEDO, Ohio (WTVG/Gray News) - Police have confirmed that the body of a child believed to be Braylen Noble has been found after a days-long search.Details on where that body was found and what led police to the discovery have not yet been released but authorities had concentrated their search on the back portion of the Hunter’s Ridge Apartments on Byrne where Noble and his mother live.That search was then further concentrated on the pool on Wednesday afternoon.“At this point, it’s turned from a missing person investigation to a death investigation,” Lt. Kellie Lenhardt told 13abc. “And it’s still a very active investigation.”Police had previously searched the pool area on Friday after Braylen was reported missing but returned on Wednesday after days of searching turned up no results.“It’s common practice in police investigations, once an area is searched, if nothing found, to go back and revisit that search area and see if anything was missed,” said Lt. Lenhardt. “But we do want to reiterate that the area was searched numerous times by Toledo Fire and Rescue, the FBI, private search groups, and both live and cadaver dogs.”On Wednesday morning, federal agents from the FBI were seen entering and exiting the building at the Hunter’s Ridge Apartments on Byrne Ave. where Braylen Noble and his mother live. They were also searching the woods and walking around other buildings.At one point Wednesday, Toledo Fire &amp; Rescue were also on the scene, putting a drone in the air to aid in the search. Toledo Police spent the morning searching the woods and an area that was in question Tuesday night.Noble was reported missing Friday afternoon when his grandmother called 911. Toledo Police released audio from the call on Tuesday; the call was placed around 30 minutes after he went missing. Authorities previously searched the apartment complex, including the pool on Friday, and expanded their search to areas around the apartments, as well as portions of Swan Creek. Large groups of volunteers have also joined the search over the intervening days.By Wednesday afternoon, authorities returned their attention to the complex swimming pool, which has been drained for days already, taping off the area around the pool and covering it with tarps. A short time later, police confirmed they had found the body of a child they believed to be Braylen Noble.Federal agents are once again at the Hunter’s Ridge apartment complex as the search for 3-year-old Braylen Noble continues. pic.twitter.com/CXC08GM7a3&mdash; Christina Williams (@cwilliams13abc) September 9, 2020
