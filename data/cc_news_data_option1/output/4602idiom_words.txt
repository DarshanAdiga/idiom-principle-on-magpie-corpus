 # Man accused of beating woman to death in Republic
 Harrison Keegan
 Springfield News-Leader
 A man has been charged with murder after he allegedly beat a woman to death this week in Republic.
 Shane Mackey, 46, was charged Tuesday with second-degree murder in connection with the killing of 42-year-old Racheal Sanders.
 Court documents say Mackey and Sanders were in a domestic relationship together.
 According to a probable cause statement in the case, Republic police were dispatched Monday morning to a home in the 400 block of North Douglas Drive for a woman who was possibly deceased.
 The statement says when an officer arrived, the house was in disarray with lots of blood visible.
 The officer allegedly found Sanders deceased while Mackey attempted to perform CPR on her.
 Mackey allegedly gave police conflicting explanations about what happened — saying Sanders had been sick and refused medical care and then that she might have been assaulted by someone else.
 Court documents say that based on the evidence, authorities determined Sanders had likely died from being assaulted by Mackey.

 The probable cause statement says Mackey has a history of domestic violence, with at least one prior disturbance involving Sanders.
 The statement says Mackey was arrested for domestic assault seven times between 2002 and 2013 and he received probation twice.
 Mackey is being held in the Greene County Jail without bond. He does not have an attorney listed for this case.
