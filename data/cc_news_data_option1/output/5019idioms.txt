The global smart water grid market is prognosticated to witness its growth spurred on the back of the requirement of managing aging infrastructure, advancement in information and communication technology (ICT), disproportion of supply and demand, water scarcity, and other factors. In order to ensure smooth supply of water and keep a tab on distribution, smart water grid could be commonly installed across nations. The need for installation could increase due to inaccurate bills issued by agencies. Smart water grid helps users to have control over water distribution.

The opposition’s procession from an Oktoberfest of opprobrium to a December of discontent has brought to the surface critical issues about our perception of democracy and the freedoms it promises to preserve. Amid a more lethal second wave of the coronavirus pandemic, the Pakistan Democratic Movement’s obdurate insistence on continuing to hold massive public gatherings is fraught with danger for more reasons than one. Apart from the public health crisis this will engender, organising big assemblies in defiance of NCOC injunctions also presents grave repercussions for the rule of law. The possible course of action for the government lies between the devil and the deep blue sea. On one hand, it could capitulate to the whims of PDM leadership and allow it to play havoc with the well-being of citizens. Conversely, any measures taken by the regime to compel compliance may precipitate violent encounters with the coalition’s activists, staining an already toxic political atmosphere with blood. There is no denying that freedom of assembly is a fundamental constitutional right. However, the same document enshrines the inviolable obligation to abide by the law; a clause conveniently overlooked by political parties that pivot their entire narrative on the sanctity of the constitution.

Taastrup (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 7th Dec, 2020 ) :A purple glow illuminates stacked boxes where lettuce, herbs and kale will soon be sprouting at one of Europe's biggest "vertical farms" which has just opened in a warehouse in an industrial zone in Copenhagen.
 Fourteen layers of racks soar from floor to ceiling in this massive, 7,000-square-metre (75,350-square-foot) hangar used by Danish start-up Nordic Harvest.
 The produce grown here will be harvested 15 times a year, despite never seeing soil or daylight. It is lit up around the clock by 20,000 specialised LED lightbulbs.
 In this futuristic farm, little robots deliver trays of seeds from aisle to aisle.
 The large aluminium boxes are mostly empty for now, but lettuce and other leafy greens will soon be growing.
 Some 200 tonnes of produce are due to be harvested in the first quarter of 2021, and almost 1,000 tonnes annually when the farm is running at full capacity by the end of 2021, explains Anders Riemann, founder and chief executive of Nordic Harvest.
 That would make the Taastrup warehouse one of Europe's biggest vertical farms.
 These urban facilities have unsurprisingly received a cool welcome from rural farmers, who have questioned their ability to feed the planet and criticised their electricity consumption.
 But Riemann stresses the environmental benefits of his farm, with produce grown close to consumers and its use of green electricity.
 "A vertical farm is characterised by not harming the environment by recycling all the water and nutrition or fertiliser," says Riemann, who uses no pesticides.
 In Denmark, a world leader in wind farms, about 40 percent of electricity consumption is wind-based.
 "In our case, we use 100 percent energy from windmills which makes us CO2-neutral," he adds.
 While he wouldn't disclose how much Nordic Harvest's electricity bill comes to, he said the power came with "wind certificates" registered on the Danish commodities exchange.

Anyone who's ever done more than stand in a surgical or cotton mask knows that exercising in one can feel a bit stifling, to say the least. But the reason isn't that you're being deprived of oxygen. It's that when you're breaking a sweat while wearing a mask, the mask traps some of the heat your body is trying to lose as your core temperature increases. This could prevent your body from efficiently cooling itself, says Christopher Lundstrom, PhD, a lecturer on sport and exercise science at the University of Minnesota. You are unlikely to overheat just from wearing a mask, but your brain will sense that increase in temperature and cause you to slow down, he says. Your workout might subsequently feel harder, which is totally OK, he adds, as long as you pay attention to your body and don't push too hard in hot and/or humid conditions.

 PkMAP provincial head Mukhtar Khan Yousafzai, general secretary Khursheed Kakaji, provincial deputy general secretary Dr Khalid Mahmood Khalid and others said that Khan Shaheed spent many years behind bars for the sake of his principles and strived to awaken and mobilize the Pakhtuns and other oppressed segments of the society to get their due rights.
 They said that he did not compromise on his principles and remained steadfast to achieve his goals. The speakers said that even the jail terms could not dampen his spirit as he strived throughout his life to uphold democratic values and rule of law, but never bowed before the oppressors.
 Khan Shaheed, they maintained, did not hesitate to render any sacrifice to win the rights for the oppressed. They vowed that the party activists would continue to work hard to accomplish the mission of the deceased leader.
 The speakers pointed out that Khan Shaheed remained imprisoned for over 30 years to uphold the principles of justice and democracy. They said he struggled against British colonial rule and took an active part in the freedom struggle to force the colonialists to quit the sub-continent.

 "Despite intensive negotiations until late last night, the gaps on level playing field, governance and fisheries are still not bridged. The outcome is still uncertain, it can still go both ways," the diplomat said.
 He was speaking after a briefing for EU member states' ambassadors to Brussels by the bloc's chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier.
 "EU-UK negotiations have entered the endgame, time is running out quickly," the diplomat said.
 "The EU is ready to go the extra mile to agree on a fair, sustainable and balanced deal for citizens in the EU and UK. It is for the UK to chose between such a positive outcome or a no deal outcome."

 En el caso de la atención telefónica, a través del número 010, se pueden realizar llamadas diferidas a los ciudadanos cuando no se pueda dar respuesta a su consulta en el momento, e igualmente éstos pueden solicitar que el servicio de atención ciudadana se ponga en contacto con ellos para solventar sus necesidades, sin intermediarios ni los denominados ‘bots’. Durante el pasado mes de noviembre, se atendieron 6.596 llamadas en total, el 67% de ellas para solicitar cita previa. Además, se atendieron 323 peticiones por chat.
 Por su parte, a través del correo electrónico, en las direcciones citaprevia@salamanca010.es y salamanca010@salamanca010.es, también se presta una atención personalizada. En noviembre se recibieron 409 e-mails, que recibieron su correspondiente contestación.
 Al mismo tiempo, en la página web www.aytosalamanca.es se puede pedir cita previa (9.164 solicitudes en total el pasado mes, principalmente para la Biblioteca Municipal Torrente Ballester, el Centro Municipal Integrado Julián Sánchez ‘El Charro’ y las dependencias centrales en la calle Íscar Peyra), acceder a la sede electrónica, solicita información y consultar edictos.
 Finalmente, la aplicación para dispositivos móviles, que se puede descargar de forma gratuita en iOs y Android bajo la denominación ‘Salamanca 010’, permite notificar incidencias en la vía pública en relación con el mobiliario urbano, las aceras, el alumbrado público, las calzadas, los parques y jardines, o la señalización (en noviembre se recibieron 142 en total, principalmente sobre parques y jardines, y acerca de desperfectos en la vía pública). También permite programar alertas, pedir cita previa, contactar con el Ayuntamiento, solicitar una llamada y acceder a la sede electrónica, entre otras funciones.

 The COVID-19 cavalry is on the horizon. Scientists have produced vaccines in record time and there’s an end in sight to the pandemic catastrophe.
 Now all you have to do is take the shot.
 That should be obvious, but it seems researchers needed a second vaccine to attack the virus of suspicion, paranoia and misinformation that threatens to derail the project.
 “To beat this pandemic, we also have to defeat the parallel pandemic of distrust,” said Francesco Rocca, president of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.
 Polls show about 60% of Americans are willing to take the vaccine. That’s a problem. In order to achieve herd immunity and snuff out the virus, about 70% of the population must be vaccinated.
 That’s about 230 million Americans, but vaccines aren’t 100% effective. The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines average about 95% efficacy.
 That means about 240 million people in the U.S. need to take it. In Florida, herd immunity through a vaccine will require inoculating about 16 million people.
 You need to be one of them. You need to put aside the conspiracy theories, historical suspicion and apprehensions that come with a new cure.
 They are nothing new. When a smallpox epidemic gripped Montreal in 1885, a conniving doctor named Alexander Ross published a pamphlet that advised sick people to visit him instead of the vaccination center.
 “THOUSANDS of PEOPLE insanely rushing to the shambles of the vaccinators,” Ross wrote, “as the people of the dark ages did to the soothsayers and miracle workers for protection against evil spirits.”
 Such nonsense is now amplified by the internet and B-list celebrities who fancy themselves epidemiologists. About 31 million people follow anti-vaccine groups on Facebook, according to Centre for Countering Digital Hate.
 Like just about everything else these days, the COVID-19 vaccine has been politicized. The right is wary of masks, shutdowns and other health edicts.
 The left turned the vaccine into a talking point. In the vice president debate, Kamala Harris said she’d take it if Dr. Anthony Fauci said to.
 Story continues
 “But if Donald Trump tells us that we should take it,” Harris said, “then I’m not taking it.”
 The demagoguery is a disservice to the medical community. It took an astounding amount of brainpower and organization it took to produce a vaccine in 10 months.
 Pfizer submitted the first application for vaccine authorization on Nov. 20 after trials on 44,000 study patients. The Food and Drug Administration had 150 people working around the clock investigating that data.
 An independent committee reviewed those findings. All the documents were made public before Thursday’s hearing. A final go-ahead is expected in a few days.
 “We realize there is an issue in the U.S. around vaccine hesitancy. There have been concerns raised about the speed with which Covid-19 vaccines have been developed,” FDA Commissioner Stephen M. Hahn told the Wall Street Journal.
 The only discernible flaw in Operation Warp Speed is its name. The partnership between government and Big Pharma expedited a cure, but no testing corners were cut in the process.
 “This will meet our gold standard of safety and efficacy that the American people have come to trust,” Hahn said.
 Not all Americans feel that trust. A discredited 1998 study on vaccines and autism has fueled the anti-vaxxer movement and no amount of hard scientific data can dissuade the true believers.
 Others aren’t absolutists. They realize vaccines for polio and smallpox have saved millions of lives, but they are wary of unproven remedies.
 Some Black Americans have a lingering distrust of government based partly on Tuskegee syphilis studies from the 1930s to the 1960s.
 “I understand you know historically — everything dating back all the way to the Tuskegee experiments and so forth — why the African American community, would have some skepticism,” Barack Obama said last week. “But the fact of the matter is, is that vaccines are why we don’t have polio anymore, the reason why we don’t have a whole bunch of kids dying from measles and smallpox and diseases that used to decimate entire populations and communities.”
 Obama, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush have said they’ll go on TV and take the vaccine to help promote its acceptance.
 And there’s good news for Vice President-elect Harris. Fauci is ready to give her a prescription.
 “I promise you, I will take the vaccine,” he said. “And I will recommend that my family take the vaccine.”
 You know who else would have taken it?
 The conniving Dr. Ross from Montreal. He’d secretly gotten a smallpox vaccination before producing the anti-vaxxer pamphlet.
 That pandemic killed 3,000 people in his city. COVID-19 has killed more than 250,000 in America, and the numbers are climbing by the hour.
 The good news is a light now flickers at the end of the tunnel. Let’s hope the vaccine is strong enough to cure the ignorance surrounding it.
