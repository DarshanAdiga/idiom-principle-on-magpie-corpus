Citizenship by Investment (CBI) has long been a route taken to secure a second citizenship. A survey conducted by CS Global Partners highlighted that 63% of British citizens would like a second citizenship and that the majority of this group made this decision because of Brexit.      "Put simply, Brexit has left people uncertain about their future. Whether it's your business, family or just the security and stability you want from your government. It has made many think of what their options really are. What is the 'Plan B' if Brexit does not favour your personal situation or the overall economic state of the country. Citizenship by Investment provides that safety net and the financial freedom they crave. As a company, we have seen a marked increase from British citizens in applying to our programmes in the Caribbean; specifically to the Dominica CBI Programme," says Paul Singh, Director of CS Global Partners, a legal advisory firm headquartered in London.

Solar power pumps are devices that majorly run on electricity generated through photovoltaic cells. These cells mainly collect the incident solar energy, which further gets converted into electric energy through various processes. Solar powered pumps are known to be widely economical in the long run as compared to electrical powered pumps majorly due to less operational costs and low maintenance expenses. Solar powered pumps also have less environmental impact than the pumps that run on electricity. Thus, looking at these advantages, these pumps are gradually being used in a large numbers, thus constituting a distinct solar pumps market from a global perspective.

In early November, the Kamats raised a funding request on ImpactGuru, one of the many crowdfunding platforms in the country.

It's only about 5 percent of the target, and Mihir knows he has a long way to go, but through crowdfunding he's taking baby steps towards a goal that, otherwise, would seem impossible.

Liverpool and Knowsley held the least coveted positions in the country, numbers one and two for covid-19 infection rates.


  Nowhere in the nation was matching numbers of more than 700 cases per 100,000 people - things had spiralled out of control and most worryingly, hospital admissions were following suit.


  Despite this, leaders here took a fair bit of criticism for apparently 'rolling over' for a Tory government, with many looking down the M62 and wondering why they weren't taking a stand against government in the way that Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham was.


  But they couldn't - the numbers here were too high and urgent action was needed.


  So the restrictions came in and kicked off a new and difficult period for this region that has already seen so much hardship during this pandemic.


  Businesses found themselves in trouble again and people's lives and freedoms were curtailed once more.


  Despite this, the majority of people recognised the danger and decided to do the right things.


  This part of the world is famous for overcoming adversity and looking after each other and for many, this was the time to show exactly why this is.


  There was further evidence of that resolve when Liverpool was announced as the pilot site for a new mass testing operation.

Chancellor Angela Merkel has urged Germans to remain patient with coronavirus restrictions, saying that, with promising vaccines on the way, “there is light at the end of the tunnel”.


  Addressing parliament the day after agreeing with state governors to extend restrictions until December 20, Ms Merkel said officials had sought to keep life as normal as possible while protecting people from the virus and ensuring hospital systems aren’t overwhelmed.


  “In the fight against the pandemic it’s not about health or economy, health or education, health or culture, health or social contacts, it’s about all of these things,” she said.


  “To think of these things in opposition to one another is a common misunderstanding but it’s always about both.”


  Germany embarked on a so-called wave-breaker lockdown on November 2, closing restaurants, bars, sports and leisure facilities but leaving schools, shops and hair salons open.


  It was due to last four weeks but Ms Merkel and the country’s 16 state governors agreed on Wednesday to extend it through until December 20.


  Their goal is to push the number of new coronavirus cases in each region below 50 per 100,000 inhabitants per week. It’s currently at 140 per 100,000, with some regions far higher.


  On Thursday, the country hit the grim milestone of more than 15,000 deaths from the coronavirus. It appeared likely to surpass one million infections on Friday, according to data from the Robert Koch Institute, the country’s disease control centre.


  Germany, which has 83 million people, was credited with a relatively good performance in the first phase of the pandemic. It still has a lower death rate than several other European countries and its current lockdown has been relatively mild.


  The current restrictions have managed to stop the exponential rise of new cases but they have stabilised at a high level. Authorities now want to try and bring this down.


  Additional restrictions the government agreed upon included further limitations on private gatherings, discouraging traditional New Year’s Eve fireworks and banning some events entirely. It will also expand mask requirements and reduce the number of customers allowed into larger stores.


  The government also plans around 17 billion euros (£15 billion) more in aid to compensate businesses hit by the lockdown. This comes on top of 15 billion euros (around £13.2 billion) provided by federal authorities in November.


  Ms Merkel said that with several promising vaccines nearing approval, possibly before Christmas, people had reason for optimism.


  “That won’t solve the problem immediately but there is light at the end of the tunnel,” she said.


  Ms Merkel’s chief of staff Helge Braun told RTL television that it was likely some restrictions would remain in place through March as the vaccine was rolled out.


  Although Ms Merkel warned politicians that the winter would be “difficult”, she stressed: “But it will end.”

With the appearance of some cases of the virus in circulation, which remains under control, Dr Etoundi Mballa says this requires health workers to readjust strategies in order to reverse the course of the disease, which tends to rise. He revealed that the commitment of healthcare professionals on the front line of the battle remains intact. Their mobilization, through permanent awareness campaigns, will continue to promote the provision of fair and reliable information on the disease to the populations. In addition, massive screening operations will continue and intensify, with a view to breaking the chain of contamination by early detection of possible positive cases and ensuring their immediate and free treatment. At this level, particular emphasis is being placed on patient follow-up. When carrying out and reporting the results of Covid-19 tests, Dr Etoundi Mballa stressed that the interview with the patient makes it possible to inform the latter and reassure him of the availability of the intervention teams for future concerns. According to the health director, this is essential because the psychological manifestations of the novel Coronavirus are characterised by reactions of stress, anxiety and depression, which require appropriate management. It is within this backdrop that the Cameroon Red Cross has made their toll-free number, which answers to 1511 available to the Ministry of Public Health, in order to help people infected and affected by COVID-19 to minimize the psychological repercussions of the Covid-19 in their life.

The Fergus Falls Planning Commission convened three public hearings Monday night and ended by approving two conditional-use permits (CUP) and one rezoning by roll-call vote.
 Donavan Rogness of Prairie View Development requested a CUP in order to split a duplex at 925 Clearview Court into two individual lots for sale. The individual lots met the minimum lot sizing for the zone. The applicant submitted a party-wall agreement to the commission. A staff suggestion to the commission was that if approved the applicant would have to abide by the party-wall agreement.
 A rezoning request by G & S Holdings owners David Gunderson and Cory Samp for a property at 507 S. Sheridan St., was approved. The request was made after a mistake to the existing zoning map was approved, switching a two-family residential zone to a general industrial area.
 G & S Holdings also sought a CUP for the Sheridan Street property.
 The statement of intent outlined a plan by the buyer to use the property as an office, for fleet storage and service space. The buyer has plans of starting a home delivery service along with displaying vehicles for sale on the property and investing approximately $30,000 to improve the building.
 The meeting also covered draft ordinance updates, a city planner update and a city council update.

The Boise State football team's success in the red zone this season comes down to mindset.


  "It's been made a priority to kind of be a shark and smell blood," Boise State quarterback Hank Bachmeier told the media on Wednesday.


  The Broncos have turned all 16 of their trips to the red zone into points this season, and they've scored touchdowns on 15 of them.


  "This particular group on offense, when they get down to the red zone, they want to finish," Boise State coach Bryan Harsin said. "Guys understand we need to score and we need touchdowns when we get down there."


  Boise State offensive coordinator Eric Kiesau said Wednesday that the Broncos need touchdowns, not field goals, on Saturday against San Jose State (2 p.m., Fox) if they're going to continue their 13-game conference winning streak, which is the second-longest in the country behind only Ohio State (19).

2020-11-25@2PMish-#Westport CT- The Westport Fire Department along with Westport Police   and EMS responded to a report of a motor vehicle crash on Saugatuck Ave at the intersection of   Charles St. Units arrived on scene and found a utility truck and a passenger vehicle involved in   a crash. The utility truck struck a utility pole after impact and the pole subsequently fell on top   of the truck. Power and other utility lines fell on top of the truck and the surrounding area. It is   believed that the fallen power lines caused phone and cable lines to ignite and burn   approximately 150 feet south of the accident. This pole and wire fire resulted in utility lines   falling to the ground south of the crash. Both drivers were evaluated for non- life-threatening   injuries and one was transported to the hospital. DEEP was notified due to a transformer leak   after it fell on the utility truck. Westport Police are investigating the cause of the crash. At the   time of this writing Saugatuck Ave remains closed to all traffic from I-95 Southbound exit 17   to I-95 Northbound exit 17, and Charles St remains closed from Franklin St to Saugatuck Ave.

It is clear what the shape of the deal looks like and as I said, it requires a constructive attitude.
 'I think on our part we have always been very consistent and transparent about what we need, the things that are important to us, why ultimately we voted for Brexit and what needs to be delivered.
 'I am hopeful that the EU will see that the vast majority of what we are asking for are things they have already agreed with other countries and we have done that deliberately and as I have said, the teams are hard at work and let's see.'
 Mr Sunak said 'in the short term especially it would be preferable to have a deal' but he insisted the Government had 'put an enormous amount of effort and resource into preparing the country' for whatever the outcome of the talks is.
 His comments came after the OBR predicted the UK's GDP will plummet by 11.3 per cent in 2020 as a result of the coronavirus crisis - the largest fall since 1709.
 The OBR also said a no trade deal Brexit would inflict yet more damage on the economy, wiping around two per cent off of GDP and adding another £10 billion of borrowing.
 Richard Hughes, the chairman of the OBR, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'Our estimate of the long term impact of coronavirus on the economy is that it scars the economy by about three per cent. That is the lost output by the end of our five year forecast period.
 'We did do a no deal scenario which looks at what would happen if we didn't arrive at a free trade agreement with the EU in five weeks' time.
 'That takes a further two per cent off output by the end of the forecast period.
 'But it is important to bear in mind that we have already reduced our forecast for output by four per cent to take account of the fact we are leaving the EU and that assumes we are going to get a free trade agreement.
 'So that two per cent would be on top of the four per cent that is already been taken out of our forecast for output in five years' time.'

BERLIN (AP) — Chancellor Angela Merkel urged Germans to remain patient with restrictions meant to slow the spread of the coronavirus, saying Thursday that with promising vaccines on the way, “there is light at the end of the tunnel.”
 Addressing parliament the day after agreeing with state governors on extending restrictions through at least Dec. 20, Merkel said officials had sought with the measures to keep life as normal as possible while protecting people from the virus and ensuring hospital systems aren't overwhelmed.
 “In the fight against the pandemic it's not about health or economy, health or education, health or culture, health or social contacts, it's about all of these things,” she said. “To think of these things in opposition to one another is a common misunderstanding, but it's always about both."
 Germany embarked on a so-called wave-breaker shutdown on Nov. 2, closing restaurants, bars, sports and leisure facilities but leaving schools, shops and hair salons open.
 It was initially slated to last four weeks but Merkel and the country’s 16 state governors agreed late Wednesday to extend it through Dec. 20 with a goal of pushing the number of new coronavirus cases in each region below 50 per 100,000 inhabitants per week. It’s currently at 140 per 100,000, with some regions far higher.
 The country hit the grim milestone Thursday of more than 15,000 deaths from the coronavirus and appeared likely to surpass 1 million infections on Friday, according to data from the Robert Koch Institute, the country's disease control center.

  BUENOS AIRES, Nov 26 (Reuters) - Argentines lined up in the streets of Buenos Aires on Thursday to say goodbye to soccer great Diego Maradona, whose casket lay in state at the Casa Rosada presidential palace draped in an Argentine flag and his famous no. 10 shirt.


  Maradona, Argentina's favorite son whose life was marred by struggles with addiction, died aged 60 following a heart attack at home on Wednesday. Huge crowds are expected to pay their respects as part of three days of national mourning.


  Early on Thursday, thousands were already forming a snaking line through the streets near the central Plaza de Mayo after a night of mourning and reminiscing. Some scuffles broke out as fans tried to get inside the palace to see their hero.


  Maradona's body lay in a wooden coffin with the blue and white national flag and an Argentina soccer jersey with the number 10 that had been part of his nickname "D10S" - a play on "dios", the Spanish word for God.


  Fans held back by a barrier threw things towards the casket, including soccer shirts, as they tried to get near the player, who had become a hero in Argentina and beyond both on and off the pitch despite his well-documented flaws.


  "He was someone who touched the sky with his hands but never took his feet off the ground," President Alberto Fernandez said on Wednesday.


  Major athletes and world leaders, including Argentina-born Pope Francis, have paid tribute to Maradona.


  On Wednesday, tens of thousands of Argentines took to the streets to mourn him, leaving flowers and messages at his childhood home and former soccer club Boca Juniors.


  Diego, Pelusa, or simply God, as Maradona was known, had a long career that included leading the South American nation to World Cup glory in 1986. Pelusa, which means fluff in Spanish, referred to Maradona's prominent mane of hair at the height of his playing days.


  The 1986 tournament included a quarter-final game against England where Maradona scored two of the best-known World Cup goals ever - an illicit "Hand of God" goal and one that followed an incredible swerving, dribble.


  Maradona battled various health problems over the years as a result of his addictions. Earlier this month, he was hospitalized for symptoms including anemia and dehydration and underwent emergency surgery for a subdural hematoma - a blood clot in the brain.


  A 2005 television clip circulated in local media in which Maradona shared what he would say at his own funeral.


  "Thank you for having played football, because it is the sport that gave me the most joy, the most freedom," Maradona said. "It is like touching the sky with my hands. Thanks to the ball."

The new Town Square park took a big stride forward Tuesday.
 In approving the 2021 City of Watertown budget, the common council freed up more funds to go ahead on the project.
 “This is good news for the town square project,” said Kristen Fish, Redevelopment Authority executive director.
 “In addition to the City’s $1 million investment, the RDA has committed $1 million to the project,” she continued. “We’re well over halfway to our goal of raising between $2.9 and $3.8 million to complete the town square.”
 The estimated town square construction budget, based on a schematic level of opinion of probable costs, accoding to the SmithGroup planners, is $1.9 million to $2.6 million for the main square, which includes the community and performance plazas, $550,000-750,000 for Water Street upgrades, and $350,000-450,000 for riverfront development and the boat dock.
 The Town Square Design Committee, which will finalize its selection of amenities in early December, has reported they are within the project’s budget. Once finished, SmithGroup will create construction documents. These documents will be used to obtain permits and construction bids. The bidding process will likely begin in early 2021 with contracts being awarded sometime in mid-March.
 For months, Town Square fundraising has been quietly active behind the scenes.
 “We were waiting for a final commitment from the City,” Fish said. With the City’s additional $1 million secured, RDA board members and Fish will be making calls and setting up appointments with the organizations, businesses, and individuals who’ve already expressed interest in funding a larger portion of the square or have been identified as a strong community partners.
 As one of the most notable projects in Watertown’s 167-year history, a donation to help build the Town Square is really an investment in a brighter future for Watertown and its people.
 “It’s more than a park hosting a few planned activities,” Fish said. “This square is where generations upon generations will gather to support and engage with the local economy, where children will learn and foster healthy living habits…the town square will be a world-class place we can all be proud of and honored to call our own.”

Germany, which has 83 million people, was credited with a relatively good performance in the first phase of the pandemic. It still has a lower death rate than several other European countries, and its current shutdown has been relatively mild.
 The current restrictions have managed to stop the exponential rise of new cases, but they have stabilized at a high level, which authorities now want to try and bring down.
 The government also agreed upon some additional restrictions Wednesday, including further limiting private gatherings, discouraging traditional New Year's Eve fireworks and banning some events entirely, expanding mask requirements and reducing the number of customers allowed into larger stores.
 The government also plans around 17 billion euros ($20 billion) more in aid to compensate businesses hit by the shutdown, on top of 15 billion euros (around $17.9 billion) provided by federal authorities in November.
 Merkel said with several promising vaccines nearing approval, possibly before Christmas, people had reason for optimism.
 “That won't solve the problem immediately, but there is light at the end of the tunnel,” she said.

 “The winter will be difficult,” Merkel told lawmakers. “But it will end.”

They spent around $40,000.“We had women literally crying and saying thank you, so we know how much it is,” Lobdell said.At first, they considered handing out gift cards, but that was taking too long. So, they went with plan B.“We literally took over every register at the grocery store, and one family would go but they wouldn’t cash them out. They’d just keep running it and keep running it. So, we just ran the cash register on all 12 aisles for two hours,” Lobdell said.After that two hours, the entrepreneurs had 10-foot-long receipts and even more draped around their necks like a badge of honor. They spent around $40,000.Lobdell and friends say the pleasure was all theirs.“I’m still floating on cloud nine after seeing those faces and getting all those hugs from the grannies and wiping tears. It was just a good feeling. A lot of us come from those situations and that type of background. So, we understand the true meaning of giving back and pouring back into our community,” Lobdell said.The group’s acts of charity didn’t end at the registers. They also paid for drivers to fill up at local gas stations and planned to give away hundreds of boxes of food on Wednesday.Copyright 2020 WXIA via CNN Newsource. All rights reserved.

Using the LCVP as a reference will now offer researchers a much higher degree of certainty and reduce confusion. And this will also increase the reliability of research results, adds Winter.

Happy Thanksgiving, everybody! We Americans, as usual, have much to be thankful for despite a tumultuous and challenging year and can see into the New Year with 2020 vision — and it’s obviously looking a whole heck of a lot better. Imagine the joyous sense of relief we’re all going to feel when this pandemic is finally beaten down once and for all.


  It’s around this time of year that I sometimes turn to the inspirational words of Archibald Rutledge for solace and reflection, but I thought the amusing observations of the late Havilah Babcock, the popular and longtime head of the University of South Carolina’s English Department and much published outdoor writer, might suffice at this moment. His heath, appropriately enough, always seemed to get better in November.


  And it got better because of the invigorating outdoor climate and, more importantly, quail shooting, a cherished Southern pastime, which has waxed and waned over the years due to fluctuating bird populations. In fact, there was a piece in South Carolina Wildlife quoting a newspaper article that lamented in great detail over the decline in quail and how poor the quail season is likely going to be due to lack of habitat, overzealous hunters and whatnot. That article was written in 1901.


  Professor Babcock was not the complaining type (or a least not when he was on the trail for quail) — particularly during the 1940s and '50s when quail fared very well overall among the bountiful and highly-managed farmlands, open pine vistas and protective hedgerows.

The Japanese take bathing seriously. It is considered to be an important, meditative Zen-like experience in sharp contrast to daily life. Wearing only our Yukatas, (thin, kimono-like robes, worn indoors) we entered the bathing area. Swimsuits are not allowed, and the only acceptable shoes worn to and from the bath are indoor slippers (not to be confused with the bathroom slippers worn only while in the toilet area). Stripped down and inside the onsen, each of us claimed a washing station where you are expected to scrub head to toe before enjoying the various pools. Most onsen’s have several pools of different temperatures ranging from scalding to ice cold along with steam and sauna rooms. We partook of it all, and emerged relaxed, wrapped in our Yukata, clean as a whistle, with skin flush and souls refreshed. We were totally bonded by this unique experience and by our entire visit to Japan.

  “We just wanted to make it something dynamic and special. And we thought ‘Fireworks to go with the lighting? How special would that be?’” George said.


  The celebratory pyrotechnics also go along with the ceremony’s theme of holiday cheer with masks and social distancing encouraged to keep people safe.


  “We’re looking forward to the statement that it’s going to make — you don’t have to be in a certain spot to witness the magic going on Downtown. You can really social distance and still see the lights and take part in it,” George said.

And what that says to me is that it's going to be more important than ever for movements, activists, people all over this country to demand the kinds of policies that Joe Biden, at least rhetorically, promised on the campaign, that the personnel that Joe Biden is appointing so far are not people who are going to necessarily do the right thing on their own. They are not necessarily people who are going to offer a different kind of path, one that doesn't appease corporate interests. They're not going to do that alone, unless they are actually pushed and pressured. And that's going to be the key.

  Dr Nishank dedicated this award to the youth of India who are engaged with dedication to once again make India, the world leader. Speaking on the occasion he said that I always wanted to see every young man and women with a meaningful job opportunity and the New Education Policy gave me an opportunity to contribute my bit for the cause.

India has the largest population of youth in the world and I want to see every youth decorated with good education, skills and respect for Indian values and culture, said Dr Nishank.


  Dr Nishank complimented Vatayan and Vaisvail Hindi Parivar for their sustained contributions to popularize Hindi. Hindi reflects our thoughts, values and culture and has the potential to lead the world, he said.

There's one other thing kids get less of when they're mainly in organized activities, and that's failure. They can't get lost and scared—they're signed in and signed out. They can't learn to suck it up when they get hurt—a sympathetic adult is always nearby with a Band-Aid or hug. Sometimes they can't even tell if they lost the game because everyone gets a trophy. Heaping helpings of failure are not recommended for anyone. But dealing with some minor bumps early on means that you're a little more prepared for some bigger ones later. That'll come in handy. What's more, there are no lessons learned as deeply as the ones we learn when we fail.

  “I encourage anyone who has gone all out with their light decorations to submit their home to the map, or maybe your neighbour has gone the extra mile and deserves some recognition for their hard work. Either way we hope to see many more additions to our map, because one thing is for certain, christmas light displays make people feel festive and happy, and we could do with a bit more of that right now!”
