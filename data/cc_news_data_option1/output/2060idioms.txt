Notwithstanding the recent Covid-19 restrictions with reduced traffic on our roads and the closure of licenced premises, we have still seen 1,153 people detected for driving under the influence of an intoxicant, since the 27th March 2020. In addition, Roads Policing members are still detecting motorists driving in excess of the speed limits, not wearing seatbelts and driving while using mobile phones. This bank holiday weekend there will be increased Garda activity and roads policing enforcement; the primary focus of this operation is to save lives and prevent serious collisions. We want people to enjoy this bank holiday weekend as best they can in difficult circumstances, but we also want every road user to act responsibly and stay safe when using the road.”

Considering the 14-day incubation period for COVID-19, we should have a pretty definitive idea of which tribe's version of reality is closer to the truth in a couple of weeks. Will it just go away, as the Phugits are saying? Are we really out of the woods? Or are we going to have to shut things down again and start all over because of a new surge of infections? We'll see.

Meanwhile, back in the old country, Katie must show her mettle in fighting off the landlord by herself instead of being rescued, and the ending is poignant and satisfying. The film has made serious and complex observations while still promoting the mythology of the melting pot, immigration, and local boys making good.
 Another Farnum/Kingston vehicle is the modern western hybrid _Ben Blair_ (1916), directed by William Desmond Taylor and scripted by Ivers from Will Lillibridge's novel. Taylor is unfortunately most famous for his unsolved murder. Ivers, one of his lovers, was briefly suspected; she wrote many of his scripts.
 The complicated, eventful plot begins with a wealthy New York plutocrat (Herbert Standing) buying a ranch "out west" for the health of his married son Scott Winthrop (Lamar Johnstone), to the dismay of Scott's snooty sticklike wife (Virginia Foltz) and the delight of their spunky daughter Florence (an unknown child actress).
 At the same time, we're treated to a lengthy tragedy of the western neighbor they have yet to meet. Rankin (Frank A. Bonn) moons disconsolately over the fact that his wife took off with a no-good, gambling, drunken, violent varmint named Tom Blair (Fred Burns). She gave birth to Tom's son Ben (Gordon Griffith), who's already several years old when his mama dies of something or other and Ben barely and not very credibly escapes from a fire set by Tom, whereupon Rankin adopts him in the informal way of the period's movies. Then we finally flash forward several years to the adult Ben (Farnum) and Florence (Kingston) and a lot more stuff happens, culminating in Ben traveling to New York to foil Florence's engagement to an effete city rat.
 A lot of almost randomly inexplicable cross-cuts to various things make us wonder if footage could be missing or out of order, unless this is really a narrative style. For example, the big excitement of Ben capturing his father in the desert and then sparing him from a lynching is intercut with lots of New York business and then dropped. Perhaps these elements exist to distract us from the point that nothing in the story is ever very convincing.
 Not many viewers today will be pleased by the way our hero bullies our heroine (who's nothing but bad judgment) instead of letting her discover her suitor's unsuitability for herself. Her spunkiness has no positive application, unlike the spy-heroine of _The Intrigue_ or Kingston's supporting role in _A Son of Erin_. On that score alone, it's easy to understand why _The Intrigue_ is the headliner. All of that said, many compositions in _Ben Blair_ are very pretty, making use of water reflections and chiaroscuro'd doorways, and anyway we're glad to have more than two hours of bonus material. Bring it on.

World’s biggest classic motor racing festival is latest sporting event called off due to COVID-19  • Organisers vow to stage a belated 30th birthday party in 2021 • Ticket holders offered full refunds or option to roll-over for next summer  World's biggest classic motor racing festival is latest sporting event called off due to COVID-19  • Organisers vow to stage a belated 30th birthday party in 2021 • Ticket holders offered full refunds or option to roll-over for next summer      It is with a heavy heart that the organisers of the Silverstone Classic announce that this summer's flagship three-day festival - originally scheduled for the weekend of 31 July to the 2 August 2020 - has sadly been cancelled.      As the world's biggest classic motor racing festival, the massive event always attracts unrivalled grids, many thousands of classic car owners and more than 100,000 visitors, many of whom camp out at Silverstone. The nature and scale of the event make running it in a safe, socially-distanced manner a huge challenge in the current situation; and the event's much-loved family festival ethos also means that running the event behind closed doors isn't a feasible option.      This summer, the pioneering Classic had massive plans to celebrate its milestone 30th birthday with a special 'greatest hits' racecard but organisers have indicated that they will carry forward these celebrations to the 2021 event.      "Following the latest Government advice we have reached the inevitable conclusion that we will need to cancel this year's event," said an enormously disappointed Nick Wigley, CEO of Classic organiser Goose Live Events. "Given the current circumstances and the unclear outlook on timescales, staging a postponed event - which was our original back-up plan - isn't something we can plan for with any degree of certainty if we are to deliver the style of Classic that we all know and love.      "I can't tell you how sad this news makes me feel. For the last 12 years it has been my life's focus to build the Classic into the most amazing family friendly classic racing festival, the biggest - and many people think the best - in the world, but our priority at all times is the safety and wellbeing of those attending our events - as well as our own team - and we know that Classic fans will understand why this step has been necessary.      "As an independent events company passionate about what we do, we are so proud to have developed the Silverstone Classic into an internationally renowned historic motorsport festival enjoyed across generations of car enthusiasts, families, racing drivers and petrolheads.      "In times of difficulty, communities tend to come together and we're incredibly grateful for everyone's continued support. It means a lot. The passion of those coming through our gates is what makes the event the success that it has become and we are now already looking forward to celebrating our delayed 30th anniversary with everyone next year instead."      The record numbers who have already purchased Super Early Bird and Early Bird tickets will be offered the option either of rolling over their tickets to the 2021 event or requesting a full refund.      All ticket holders will be contacted in June with details of the next steps. As ever all the latest information can be found at www.silverstoneclassic.com.

Bluetooth Low Energy chips are ubiquitous in wireless devices, such as cellphones, smart watches, wireless keyboards, wireless mice, wireless ear buds, smart home devices, asset trackers, telehealth devices, etc. As these devices proliferate, the market grows at a 10-20% rate. Nordic breaks up its revenue into five end markets: Consumer electronics (35% of revs in Q1, grew 16% YoY), Wearables (16% of revs, grew 49% YoY), Building / Retail (19% of revs, grew 64% YoY), Healthcare (8% of revs, grew 28% YoY), Other (17% of revs, grew 38% YoY). It is a pretty well-diversified mix for a mid-sized company.
 Nordic grew revenue at a 33% clip in Q1 (off an easy comp) and forecast revenue growth of mid-teens for Q2. Gross margins came in at 51.9% which is a bit above guidance due to positive mix. EBITDA margins came in at 7.5% in the seasonally slow quarter. We are expecting 13.7% EBITDA margins for the year. Covid-19 is having a mixed-impact on the company. Some of its end products, such as wireless mice and keyboards, benefit from the work from home (WFH) trend while others are hurt by the downturn in consumer spending. The company saw order strength in Q1, with an ending backlog up 39% year-over-year and 16% sequentially although the company attributed some of this to early ordering by customers to secure supply.
 ZigBee, Thread, and ANT are used in smarthome applications but make up a small part of Nordic’s revenue stream. Its support for these protocols is important in case customers want to use them but they are less in demand that Bluetooth currently. Nordic also has a proprietary chip, where it started its business, that makes up 20% of its revenue stream. This chip is a shrinking part of the business but is still used by some customers in legacy designs.
 Nordic’s stock has had a big run from the bottom and now sits near 52-week high levels. As a value-players, why are we interested in the stock here? The reason is that Nordic is at the inflection point of a massive product cycle that will both help revenue growth and margins. Over the past three years, the company has been developing cellular chips for the Internet-of Things (IoT) market. These chips, for the Cat M1 and NB-IoT standards, area targeting a huge market for long-range connectivity. Examples of end uses for these chips include smart meters, smart street lighting, fleet management, smart agriculture, etc. The incumbent in this market is Qualcomm but this market is not the focus of its business given its relatively small size next to Qualcomm’s smartphone business. As in the Bluetooth market, Nordic has lower- power, higher performance chips. These chips were only launched at the end of last year and contributed $1 million in Q1 revenue (out of $70.2 million total) but the design wins are starting to ramp which will lead to higher revenue down the road.

SWANSEA - Two teachers at Case Junior High were recognized on Saturday as part of a surprise retirement parade, and the event offered a chance for colleagues and even former students to give them a proper sendoff.
 Joe Monteiro, an eighth-grade history teacher, and Jayne Cestodio, the media center secretary, were honored after their last days as educators were cut short to the COVID-19 pandemic. Both teachers had tremendous impact on their students, other faculty members, and the community, as evidenced by the dozens of cars that turned out to say goodbye.
 Cestodio, who ran the media center for 30 years, is a passionate teacher who took pride in developing her students academically, but in turning young boys and girls into young men and women, she said.
 "Seeing them grow from sixth grade to eighth grade always amazed me," she said. "They came to our school nervous, but very excited and then by the time they reached the eighth grade they were much more confident and mature."
 Every year, Cestodio would join her students in going on the Washington, D.C., field trip. She recalls these memories as some of her favorites as a teacher. "You would form a bond with the eight students that you were responsible for," Cestodio said. "For me they were 'my kids' for those couple of days."
 The retirement parade came as a big surprise to Cestodio, as she never would have expected an event honoring her, especially in a time of isolation and social distancing. However, Cestodio said she appreciated the event and its creativity. "Fortunately during this pandemic, people have started to take a step out of the box to try and honor or celebrate a special time in people's lives."
 The retirement parade provided some closure, Cestodio said, in a time where the closing of schools has altered the everyday interactions teachers have with their students. When asked about what made this event special for her, Cestodio commented, "After working with people for so many years it is nice when they reach out to you. It makes you feel special."
 When asked about the impact he's had on his students, Monteiro said, "You sometimes don't realize that at the time."
 Two years ago, Monteiro received the Teacher of the Year award at Case Junior High, an accomplishment that speaks volumes about his impact on students' academic and social lives.
 Monteiro was very grateful and appreciative of his wife, Susan Monteiro, and colleague Julie Silva for organizing the event. "My wife is amazing and how she put this together with Julie Silvia was totally unexpected and completely appreciated!"
 Monteiro had no idea it was being planned. "How she kept it a surprise was amazing and the turnout by my coworkers and past and present student was overwhelming ... stunned," he said.
 Just like Cestodio, Monteiro emphasized the idea of closure and how it was so important, especially because of the sudden end to this school year. "Closure is so important and it wasn't able to happen this year in a traditional setting. What happened today provided Jayne and myself with that experience," he said.
 "I spent my days, my years with these people who became my family," Cestodio added. " I was truly blessed to have made many lifelong friends while loving what I did every day."

While this wasn’t the ideal, for Erickson this was the best it could be given the circumstances.
 “I think everyone wishes it could be better,” he said. “But the students can be together one last time, in a way.”
 Students themselves have had an interesting year, no matter their year.
 “Coming into this year I never would have thought anything out of the normal would happen, was just gonna be another year,” said Hannah Stieve, a senior. “Our class of 2020 will not be able to say that we took pictures on the last day of school, had a traditional graduation ceremony, got to hug our friends as we all move onto our next chapter of our lives, but we are able to say we are unique because of it.”
 Stieve herself worked on yearbook, which was difficult to say the least. According to Stieve, the yearbook had to be completed before Spring Break, which as some remember, was around the time digital learning started for schools. As such, the three editors had to finish the yearbook in a single night, staying up all night to get it done.
 “Although it was a stressful situation I still feel that it was one of the most fun things we had done,” she said. “Overall, my senior year is quite a memorable one, even if it was not the way we all planned.”
 Going into next year, there are still plenty of uncertainties. Until further guidance is given by the Department of Education and Health, fall of 2020 is an unknown. For returning students, though, they did their best to make the most of a strange situation.
 “It was going to be a very special year because it would be my first year of playing high school sports and last time playing these sports in my ninth grade year,” said Josephine Beneke, a freshman. “I am trying to make the most of things by running miles and lifting weights at home, but it is not the same without my friends.”
 Until then, though, it’s best to celebrate the accomplishments of these students. Erickson stated that there will be plenty of photos being taken, so families further in the rear of the lot won’t be left out. Instead of throwing hats, he’s rented a drone to take overhead photos of students once the ceremony is over. Photos will be shared with families once they are organized.
 For everyone coming out to graduation, the parking lot is on Morse Street, right in front of the main entrance to the high school. Cars will have to be socially distanced, about a space apart. Spaces will be marked. Pomp and Circumstance will be playing on the radio at 5:45pm on KGLB, and continue to play throughout the ceremony which starts right away at 6pm.

The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Wednesday accused Congress leader Rahul Gandhi of trying to create "falsehoods" about the Centre's response to the Covid-19 pandemic, and questioned why his views were being sidestepped by Congress-ruled states.
 Addressing the media via video conference, Union law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad also accused Gandhi of trying to weaken the country's resolve to fight this challenge since the start of the Covid-19 outbreak. Prasad said Gandhi's campaign was based on falsehood, deliberate twisting of facts and misinterpretation.
 He said anyone with better solutions should offer suggestions, and the government would be willing to look into them.
 Coronavirus outbreak: Full coverage
 On Tuesday, Gandhi criticised the government's decision to continue with the nationwide lockdown and said contrary to expectations, infections had spiked during this period.
 Prasad said, "Barring China, in the 15 counties which have been hit by the pandemic, the population is 142 crore and India has 137 crore, and so far we have 3.43 lakh deaths globally and in India 4,345. The recovery percentage is also high."
 Criticising Gandhi for spreading "negativity, misinformation and fake news", Prasad questioned why the Congress governments of Punjab and Rajasthan imposed lockdown at the earliest if such a measure isn't a solution for Covid-19.
 "Maharashtra (where the Congress is a partner in the ruling alliance) extended it till May 31. Do your CMs not listen to you?" Prasad said.
 Attacking the Congress leader, Prasad said even as Congress president Sonia Gandhi said the credit for the "Bhilwara model" should go to Rahul Gandhi for his early warning, the sarpanch of the area had refuted the claim.
 "He said his constituency was recognised by the health ministry for tackling the pandemic, whereas it was declared as a hot spot. He's asking for the Nyay scheme whereas the Modi government has announced a Rs 20 lakh crore package…he spoke about passing on benefits of the global oil price crash, but there was a VAT hike in Rajasthan and Punjab raised diesel prices," Prasad added.
 To a question on Gandhi's remarks that the government should come clean on the border standoff with China, and that there should be transparency on a border row with Nepal, Prasad said, "Narendra Modi ke Bharat ko koi ankh nahi dikha sakta (No one can browbeat India.)"
 On the Supreme Court's observation that concentrated efforts are required to address the issues of migrant workers, he said the court had "issued notice and the government of India or the state government, as the case may be, will respond on what steps have been taken".
 He added, "I can only respond in all humility that all governments are doing their best. These are very challenging times, if anyone has better solutions to offer suggestions, we are willing to look into that. But in the given situation the best possible efforts are being done and will continue to be done."
 Referring to the spread of the Coronavirus in Gujarat, he said the Centre has already sent the director of AIIMS to guide the state in controlling the pandemic. "We don't want to see the political colour of any state government, but the whole country has to work in unison. We have to overcome this crisis and I am confident that we shall overcome it," he said.

"Their statements don't hurt the Chinese government. It only hurts us, and he seemed to be blind to that idea, which is again, very, very disappointing," he said.
 But Trump is not the only person to dispense misinformation, Lam said, noting U.S. Rep. Seth Moulton, D-Mass., co-sponsored a resolution calling on China to accept the coronavirus blame. Moulton later withdrew his name and apologized after facing backlash.
 "There are the number of reasons why he did that, but it's still racism," said Lam, adding the resolution reflected his belief and created a good opportunity for him to consider his action carefully as his 6th Congressional District has a large Asian population. "He really needs to think twice before alienating his constituents."
 Disease-related discrimination
 Ignorance also plays a significant role, particularly when a virus is involved.
 "The more knowledgeable you are about something, the less you have to fear," said Chan, citing the AIDS crisis resulted in "a lot of ignorance and fear" and led to a hatred against gay communities, spreading myths such as sharing the bathroom or having food with those who tested positive could increase risk of infection.
 Survival instinct leads humans to recognize physical differences among others, but problems emerge when they start to place a value on those differences, Shim said.

Living with COVID-19 around us requires a new balance that may change over time. While it would be wonderful, reducing cases to zero is probably not realistic for a while. Meanwhile, our communities need economic activity and we need social interactions. Thus, some people are venturing out more and businesses are reopening. Some places are doing this more cautiously than others. We need to get creative and adjust our expectations of normal for a while. Our elders and those with high risk conditions may not be safe or feel safe, so we should do what we can to help them. Washing hands, wearing masks and being mindful of the distance between us are not perfect but are still the best forms of protection for now.
 No one knows what the future holds. Perhaps reopening the economy will increase our cases of COVID-19, and perhaps not. Perhaps the virus will dissipate over the summer months. If it re-emerges in the fall, will we be ready? Will we plan and use this time to prepare? Will we again work together to protect our fellow man? Let’s use this time wisely and find our new balance.

Nach den ersten Teamtrainings seit mehr als zwei Monaten hat die Basketball- Bundesliga einen weiteren Schritt auf dem Weg zum Meisterturnier gemacht.
 Alle Spieler und Betreuer, die schon vor dem vergangenen Wochenende in Deutschland waren, wurden nach Angaben der BBL bei ihren zehn Teams zweimal negativ auf das Coronavirus getestet. Wie diffizil der Plan bleibt, die Saison bis zum 28. Juni mit 35 Partien im Münchner Audi Dome zu Ende zu spielen, zeigt jedoch der positive Befund eines aus dem Ausland einreisenden Spielers. Dieser Profi habe zu keiner Zeit Kontakt zu seinem Team gehabt und wurde isoliert, wie die Liga mitteilte.
 Die Liga sah die erste "Bewährungsprobe" für ihr Hygiene- und Sicherheitskonzept damit als "bestanden" an. Bis das Turnier am 6. Juni mit der Partie zwischen der BG Göttingen und den Hakro Merlins Crailsheim eröffnet wird, bedarf es aber weiter höchster Wachsamkeit. "Jeder Einzelne muss sich in den kommenden sechs Wochen sehr intelligent und diszipliniert verhalten", betonte Marko Pesic, Geschäftsführer von Titelverteidiger FC Bayern München der Deutschen Presse-Agentur. "Ich habe keine Zweifel, dass uns das gelingt."
 Mit einem "riesengroßen Vertrauensvorschuss" (Pesic) hatte die bayerische Staatsregierung die Basketballer durch die Genehmigung des Konzepts ausgestattet. Die Erfahrungen mit Spielen ohne Zuschauer will die BBL auch mit europäischen Ligen und anderen Sportarten in Deutschland teilen. "Wir müssen schauen, dass der Basketballsport in Europa überlebt, dass in Deutschland der Hallensport überlebt", sagte BBL-Geschäftsführer Stefan Holz in einem Podcast von Magentasport. Dabei kündigte er eine Zusammenarbeit mit der Handball- Bundesliga und der Deutschen Eishockey Liga an, die ihre Saison abgebrochen hatten.
 Nur wenige Stunden nach dem politischen Okay stiegen die ersten Basketball- Teams wieder ins lang ersehnte Mannschaftstraining ein. Im BBL-Konzept sind drei Wochen Mannschaftstraining vorgesehen. Doch weil sich die Entscheidung der Behörden etwas länger hinzog, sind es nun nur noch zweieinhalb Wochen, bis es in München losgeht. Notwendig für die Rückkehr ins Training ist die Genehmigung der lokalen Gesundheitsämter, die an vielen Standorten bereits vorliegt.
 "Wir müssen uns jetzt so gut vorbereiten, wie es geht", sagte Bayerns Nationspieler Paul Zipser dem Online-Portal "spox.com". Ob die kurze Vorbereitungszeit zu mehr Verletzungen führe, vermöge er nicht zu sagen. Aber: "Wenn ein Profisportler nicht in seinem normalen Rhythmus ist oder nicht die übliche Vorbereitung hat, dann ist das Risiko natürlich höher", sagte der frühere NBA-Profi.
 Die Bayern trainieren bereits wieder in Gruppen. In Oldenburg, Göttingen und Vechta liegt schon die Erlaubnis zum Kontakttraining vor, weshalb Rasta-Coach Pedro Calles seine Spieler gleich am Dienstagabend zur ersten gemeinsamen Einheit bat. "Das ist ein Etappensieg gegen die Pandemie, die uns allen die Normalität genommen hat", sagte Oldenburgs Trainer Mladen Drijencic, der mit seinem Team am Mittwoch wieder ins Teamtraining einstieg.
 Die Freude und Erleichterung, die Saison im speziellen Format mit zehn Clubs und dreiwöchiger Hotel-Quarantäne doch noch sportlich zu Ende zu bringen, war überall groß. "Es ist besser, diesen Wettbewerb zu spielen, als gar keinen", sagte Alba Berlins Coach Aito. Doch auch der Trainer-Veteran sieht die Risiken der kurzen Vorbereitungszeit. "Wir müssen nun so schnell wie möglich in das Mannschaftstraining einsteigen und die ausländischen Spieler integrieren, die derzeit noch in Quarantäne sind, damit wir bis zum Turnier unseren bestmöglichen Basketball spielen können", sagte der Spanier.

Scongiurare il divieto di portare fiori freschi in cimitero, d'estate, per evitare il rallentamento delle vendite e dare una boccata d'ossigeno al settore del florovivaismo che, con l'assenza di cerimonie, matrimoni e altri eventi, sta vivendo una crisi senza precedenti. E' l'appello che Vincenzo Malafronte, presidente del Consorzio Produttori Florovivaisti Campani, rivolge ai sindaci, ai quali spiega, "le cause che avevano portato a tale divieto oggi non sussistono piu". Per Malafronte e fondamentale "conoscere quanto prima le regole per la ripartenza degli eventi, che per il 2020 sono completamente azzerati". Il florovivaismo, sottolinea il presidente del Consorzio Produttori Florovivaisti Campani, stenta a uscire dal lockdown: "Piu di altri, a causa dell'incertezza e della scarsa fiducia, non riesce a programmare le produzioni con un conseguente ulteriore rallentamento della ripresa" e la festa della mamma, "ha portato solo una breve boccata d'aria". Grava sul settore, ribadisce, "l'assenza di cerimonie, matrimoni, feste e eventi, che si sta facendo sentire e non poco sul nostro comparto. Perdite che si stanno sommando a quelle gia registrate durante la quarantena, con imprenditori e cooperative costrette a mandare al macero il 100% della produzione". Secondo i dati in possesso del Consorzio sono stati circa 10mila gli appuntamenti saltati solo in Campania e, aggiunge Malafronte, "chi considera che nel 2021 avremmo il doppio del lavoro perche dovremmo recuperare i matrimoni e le cerimonie saltate quest'anno - fa un grosso errore di valutazione". "Anzi - conclude il presidente del Consorzio - paradossalmente potremmo trovarci con un settore ingessato e senza approvvigionamenti. Con l'aggravante di dover comprare dall'estero non aiutando certo il comparto made in Italy".

The experience of work disruption during the outbreak of the coronavirus epidemic has made people like Mi Zhen, 36, scared of losing his job.
 The employee of China’s electric bike manufacturer, Aima Technology Group Co, said a month-long home quarantine during the nationwide epidemic control measures in February, weighed on his family life. He said he and his wife could barely make ends meet with their salaries from the company to pay for a mortgage and car loans of more than 7,000 yuan (US$985) a month.
 Since Aima started to select employees from low-risk epidemic areas to restart work on February 15, he and his wife, who hail from eastern Shandong Province, immediately drove for six hours to return to the company in northern Tianjin City. They were able to secure their former positions after the mandatory 14-day quarantine period.
 Like Mi, some 900 workers rushed back to the company via various car-pooling means in order to secure their jobs.
 The epidemic has had a great impact on the lives of the working class. At the Tianjin-based scooter company, over 90 percent of its employees are migrant workers.
 In the face of the labor shortages, the company (with a former workforce of over 3,000 people) had to recruit more than 300 migrant workers from northwest China’s Gansu Province, 1,000 kilometers away and considered a low-risk region during the outbreak.
 Among the new workers, Zhang Xinling, 33, said she had worked in Beijing as a saleswoman at a shopping mall, while her husband was a driver in a courier company.
 The couple returned home to Gansu during the Spring Festival in January. They failed to retain their jobs in Beijing after they could not return to their posts on time, due to delays resulting from the epidemic control measures. These were aimed at reducing large passenger flows to prevent cross- infections.
 “Aima’s job offers are important for us to raise three kids and support two senior people in my family,” Zhang said, revealing that the company offers her a monthly salary of 6,000 yuan with free boarding and meals.
 Li Shizhi, executive director of Aima, said the firm currently employs 3,100 people, which is on par with the scale before. Its production lines are operating at full capacity to catch up with orders, with a daily output of 15,000 e-bikes.
 According to the municipal bureau of industry and information technology, as of May 18, the work resumption rate of 197,500 micro, small and medium-sized enterprises in Tianjin reached over 95 percent. Over 2.5 million employees, or 94 percent of the total number of workers they employ, have resumed work.

Restaurant players have started a dialogue with mall owners to explore new ways of engagement like revenue share model in the post-COVID-19 period, the National Restaurant Association of India (NRAI) said on Wednesday.
 The NRAI explained that restaurants do not expect the business volume in the post-pandemic period to be more than 30 per cent to 40 per cent of the pre- lockdown numbers.
 "Considering that the proportion of fixed operating expenses in our business is very high, this may lead to massive operating losses to many businesses unless the expenses are brought down significantly and a critical expense like rentals is converted into a variable cost," it added.
 The NRAI said it has written to all malls owners that the mandated lockdown has forced restaurants to shut shop and prevented the malls to allow entry to guests, staff or suppliers of restaurants.
 This is a clear case of force majeure and therefore all charges of rentals or common area maintenance (CAM) for the duration of the lockdown needs to be waived entirely.
 The industry body has also pointed out that the engagement contours in the post-COVID era needs to move towards a totally variable model.
 Such revenue-share model will ensure that the fortunes of both parties, i.e., restaurants and malls are firmly inter-linked,the statement said.
 "While we continue with our advocacy efforts with the Government for strong stimulus packages, NRAI is steadfast in its belief that no business will be able to sustain itself post resumption on older terms of engagement," NRAI President Anurag Katriar said.
 The industry cannot operate on old costs with less than half of older revenue, he added.
 "Therefore, I reckon that revenue share is a very fair model that will ensure that malls don't lose out if we see an unexpected early surge in business volumes," Katriar said.
 NRAI totally understands that the malls too have huge costs to take care of, which is not easy with reduced cash flows. Unfortunately, this is the stark reality for every business, including restaurants, he added.
 "Most of our members have expressed their unwillingness and inability to restart the business unless these issues get firmly and proactively resolved...I am fairly certain that as long-standing business partners of ours, the landlords will extend their support in these times of unprecedented crisis," Katriar said.
 NRAI will soon initiate similar proactive dialogues with other stakeholders such as food service aggregators and individual landlords as well, the statement said.

Aside from potential cash difficulties or share dilution, the usual rules for clinical-stage assets could apply. New data could reveal safety or efficacy problems. FDA approval is never assured. Pricing of commercial products is uncertain, they may not excite prescribers, or may be unable to get traction against competition.
 ## Conclusion
 I think Agenus has been overlooked this year because of the COVID-19 epidemic and investor money flowing into companies developing vaccines and therapies for that. Cancer is not going away. Current treatments can be approved upon. Submissions of balstilimab and zalifrelimab data to the FDA for potential approval may be just around the corner (before year-end 2020). AGEN1181 looks like it might be objectively better than Yervoy as a therapy. Beyond that the pipeline is broad. Agenus seems to have at least as much insight into the human immune system as any other company, and those insights and the therapies developed from them appear to be about to bear fruit. Agenus closed at $2.54 on May 26, giving it a market cap of $431 million. That is about equal to revenue from one quarter of Yervoy. Nothing is guaranteed, but the data looks good, so I think Agenus investors should start pricing in some success with balstilimab, zalifrelimab, and 1181.

 I am writing this column from my home office just north of Redwood Falls. This is not the first time I have worked from home.
 However, this has become a new normal for me. Yet another sign of the times.
 The world has changed, and I'm learning to change with it. Now that the stay- at-home order to combat the new coronavirus (COVID-19) has been lifted, I hope that we can all return to a somewhat normal life in the near future. I hope that we all get to see the other side of the pandemic.
 For now, those are only hopes, and I have to confess that I do not believe they will come true by the time you read this column. Nevertheless, I am clinging to hope.
 I am learning to balance my optimism with reality, one day at a time. I've done it before.
 I always pride myself on adapting to change. I view change as being inevitable.
 When one fights change, life is only that much more difficult.
 When the Internet started to become widespread I embraced the concept and taught myself how to navigate the World Wide Web.
 When smartphones became ever present in society, I finally ditched my flip- phone and embraced the concept of having a mini computer in the palm of my hands.
 After 9/11, I adjusted to the presence of security and surveillance.
 Now, with COVID-19 I am learning to adjust. I will admit, it has been more challenging - from wearing a mask, practicing social distancing, avoiding touching my face, as well as increasing hand washing.
 COVID-19 has taken center stage in our lives, regardless of whether we like it or not. COVID-19 has changed how we live, work and access health care.
 Given all this change it's up to us individually and collectively as a whole to embrace changes to secure the health and safety of all of those around us.
 I now feel the divisions of politics within our nation will only be compounded by COVID-19. Some have resisted to the new practices put into place that are recommended to slow the pandemic as well as some even resisting the concept of the COVID-19 altogether.
 Living through a pandemic once would be enough for anyone. Doing so again is not something any of us would want.
 We all want to return to a sense of normalcy. However, the current situation of COVID-19 within communities needs us to act, change and adhere to practices that will contain the pandemic.
 It's up to each of us to have that ever so difficult self conversation about what we can do individually to press forward.
 To all readers - sacrifice, responsibility, looking out for others, and staying informed are our best lines of defense.
 Stay well readers.

City leaders indicate they have been getting lots of questions around the latest state directives. They also have been feeling pressure from a faction of community members pushing the city to re-open more quickly than the governor’s and state health leaders’ slow, cautious phased approach.
 That was a topic of discussion at last Monday’s city council work session May 18, with Waconia’s legal counsel noting that the city is a political subdivision of the state, so it doesn’t have the authority to override a state executive order, and there could be consequences for the city and businesses should it defy the state.
 While it reacts to the governor’s directive implementing the next phase of his plan to reopen restaurants and bars, at city hall, personnel have taken steps to equip the help/service desk with plexiglass screens, similar to what are in many grocery/hardware stores, to prepare for the reopening of that facility, although it remains closed for now.
 With summer coming and many entertainment venues shuttered and events cancelled, the city also is exploring how it might provide some local entertainment through its music and movies in the park series.
 Then there’s the third phase of reopening down the road, which would include gyms and fitness centers like Safari Island. No dates or directives set yet.

The Rhodesia Hockey Association, the first national hockey administration, was established in 1925, and was affiliated to the South African Hockey Association. The association affiliated to the Federation International de Hockey (FIH) in 1961, with the first official test match played in Bulawayo on 9th August, 1961 against Kenya. Whilst the home team won that encounter, the visitors drew the series with a win in Salisbury a few days later. Men’s teams participated in the Tokyo 1964 Olympics and qualified for the 1968 Mexico Olympics, they could not actually participate.

The Reno Rodeo Association knows how to put on a show. They open with old glory, followed with the national anthem and then a prayer. They also know how to give back. At one of the recent rodeo’s all of the work force in the arena wore pink shirts in salute to breast cancer research. The following year all of the work force wore purple shirts in support of men’s prostate cancer research. I can relate to both of these diseases. My way of supporting both of them was to try to purchase each last year’s shirt. This was not as easy as it sounds. Cotton did not know how, but suggested that I call the rodeo office. It took several calls but I finally contacted Ken Miner, Specialty Sales chairman. He would do the best he could. Shortly after I received in the mail a pink Reno Rodeo shirt. It comes with the rodeo monogram on the right side. Ken could not locate a purple shirt for me. I was most appreciative for the pink shirt and told Ken I would look him up at this last year’s rodeo. I would be the guy in the pink shirt. The cost of the shirt was a Jim Beam over (rodeo talk). We arrived early to eat at a food court just behind the grand stand. The court offers everything from corn on the cob to pickled pigs’ feet. We wandered through the court to find the rodeo store where we could find my new shirt friend. Sure, enough he was right there at the Reno Rodeo Specialty Store. We all introduced each other to Ken and wife Marianne. I immediately offered to pay my debt to society and buy Ken and his wife a Jim Beam over. Then the horror set in that there was no Jim Beam bar, only Jack Daniels. This was Jack Daniels night and all of the work force were wearing Jack Daniel’s black rodeo shirts. While John went over to the bar to get a couple of Jack’s for Ken and Marianne, she was shuffling something around. Surprisingly she had a purple shirt for me. She had found Ken’s purple shirt from the previous year, washed it, ironed it and had it for me. Ken and Marianne are right up there with motherhood and apple pie. On the way out of the rodeo I had bought a black rodeo shirt.

With Delaware County scheduled to move into the "yellow phase" of the state's reopening plan on June 5, at least we'll begin to get some clarity on what we can expect this summer. And, perhaps, if we are so lucky, Delco will be in the green phase before the Fourth of July and Gov. Tom Wolf will give us the signal to commence outdoor sporting activities.
 While many of the youth in-house leagues have canceled their seasons, perhaps the older kids -- the high school graduates who are going off to college to play baseball -- will be able to get in a few games in before the leaves start to fall.
 One of the best summer assignments for any local sports reporter is Little League baseball. That's one gig I am going to miss this July. Last year, it was an absolute blast following around the little guys from Newtown Edgmont Little League, who captured the Section 8 title. There was the never-ending rain delay in the Section 8 tournament. The game resumed sometime after 10 p.m., past the newspaper's deadline. Hanging out in the clubhouse with the kids during the long respite was the best part of the night.
 That memorable NELL team advanced all the way to the state championship game led by Brady Abate, Chase McMahon, Jack Maholick, twins Harrison and Grady McTear, and many others. Most Little Leaguers act the same. Win or lose, they are thrilled to be interviewed after a game. If you ask the coach for one or two kids, soon the entire team is on the scene, just waiting for you to ask them the next question. That youthful innocence is lost this summer.
 As for Major League Baseball ... will the owners and players ever see eye-to- eye? It's OK to be mad at billionaire owners for crying about the lost revenue just as it's OK to scoff at that $150 million All-Star who says he's not going to risk his health under these circumstances. As of Tuesday, the players union and the league are so far apart on issues concerning pay and, most importantly, safety protocols, that a prospect of a MLB season seems dim at best.
