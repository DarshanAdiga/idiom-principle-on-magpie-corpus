I've spent my entire life. Committed to justice. And doing so would integrity. Those who know me well. Know that I've been a champion for victim's. Particularly women and children who suffered abuse. I've always done what I believed to be right. In my years as prosecuting attorney. Are always respected and follow the rule of law. I respect and value the constitution. Are sacred document that serves at the very foundation. Upon which this great nation was established. It begins we the people. In order to form a more perfect union. Establish justice. Justice. The gains its integrity through the protection of individual rights such that every single person. Will be afforded due process of law and that means fairness. And yet. Somehow. That protection. That's standard of fairness. That benefit of the doubt. That presumption of innocence until proven guilty. Has escaped my grass. I never dreamed. This could happen to me. And yet. Here I stand. I stand before you a condemned man. Condemned without trial. Condemned without notice. Condemned it without the benefit of any basic rights. That ensure. Fairness. These past several days have witnessed my name and reputation dragged through the gutter in ways I would have never imagined. Apparently in this climate. The standard is guilty. And who cares. If your Anderson. Let me explain how this played out. Late Friday afternoon on the 29 of June. Minutes before boarding a flight I first learned about an internal investigation completed by an outside law firm. To review workplace sexual harassment allegations. Three days later. The press had published. A leaked memo documenting this investigation. Within hours of its release. There were calls. For my resignation. Not only was I already convicted. It was without an opportunity to be heard. Let alone receive any notice. Of the accusations. I now stand falsely and publicly. Accused of abhorrent behavior. These false allegations. Have irretrievably. Damaged. My reputation. Folks we are living at a time where accusations alone. Have the power. Of conviction. Now understand me. Victims of sexual abuse and or sexual harassment deserve to have their voices heard. As a prosecuting attorney I fought hard for the rights of victims. While also safeguarding. The rights of the accused. This is America. And in America we cannot overlook the presumption of innocence. Until proven guilty. I was not afforded fairness in this investigation. I'm now being called upon to resign by the governor and others. And I respect the governor. And I believe him to be an honorable man. And I wish he had reached out to me regarding these accusations. Before rushing to judgment. Calls for my resignation came in the same breath. As calls for an investigation. But he inspector general. Across the country. We see a media. Based on sensationalism. Nurturing an appetite for scandal. Fueled. By social media. Today. It seems that appetite. Can only be satisfied. By complete destruction. Under normal circumstances. Leaders. Would call for restraint. And respect for fairness. At accountability based on the time tested processes on which our country was founded. But these are not normal circumstances. Pressure immediately mounted on friend and foe to distance themselves from me and even ask for my resignation at the first available opportunity. Perhaps this regrettable rush to judgment is best explained. By self preservation instinct. The coordinated calls from our resignation occurred before any anonymous accusers identified themselves. Well this past Friday. One of the accusers came forward with a new statement. Images settle I had arrived at ages lounge alone when in fact. I was a guest. And arrived with Tony Stan. Furthermore. In her statement on Friday she confirmed that her accusation which is the most serious accusation by far. Contained in the confidential report. Was materially. Inaccurate. This in accurate confidential report. Had formed the basis for the calls from our resignation. These calls for my resignation are unwarranted. And those calls should be rescinded. I anticipate and welcome the opportunity to have my side heard through a proper. Investigation. And therefore I won't be taking questions today in anticipation of that opportunity in that investigation. But. I look forward to the day when I can speak freely. And answer questions that you may have. Now. I'm gonna give back to work but before I do. I have one less thing to say. A week ago today. I had a name. And I want my name back.

Eight years after packing his bags and returning to South Africa, Shaun Payne still longs for the day when he gets to take another stroll along Lough Derg in the beautiful surrounds of Ballina. The two-time Heineken Cup winner and his family had hoped to travel back to the Tipperary village this Christmas, but those plans will likely have to be shelved due to Covid-19.Payne has his own reasons for wanting to visit the place they called home for nine years, not least because of the strong friendships he built up throughout his successful stint with Munster, while his wife Michelle and kids Dylan (18) and Amy (16) are also keen to return to Ireland.The connection with Munster still runs deep, and although they are living thousand of kilometres away, Payne was reminded of that strong bond recently when Dylan was on a video call with several of his former class-mates, as well as his teacher, from Boher primary school.That's the thing about small Irish villages, people are made to feel welcome and while Payne arrived as an outsider, he left an honorary Munster man.That was mainly due to the pivotal role he played in helping the province finally land the Holy Grail, by beating Biarritz in the 2006 Heineken Cup final. Payne was a rock at full-back and brought a touch of class which helped Declan Kidney's side over the line on that memorable day in Cardiff.Two years later, he took on a player/manager role, but when injuries struck, Payne found himself featuring in all six pool games until Denis Hurley came into the team for the knockout stages en route to a second European title. As Payne puts it himself, his bones were creaking at that stage of his career, but that didn't make watching on from the sideline any easier as Munster enjoyed another unforgettable day when they toppled Toulouse back in the Welsh capital.Payne hadn't planned for the manager's position, which was the first time Munster made it a full-time role, but such was his impact on and off the pitch, Garrett Fitzgerald was determined to keep him involved.It's still hard for Payne to comprehend that the former CEO, the man who sparked his Munster love affair, and former team-mate Anthony Foley are no longer with us.&quot;It's very sad – Axel and Garrett were two of the guys who were at the core of building Munster up to what they have become,&quot; says the 48-year- old. &quot;Axel was one of my closest mates, and Olive of course. We lived right next to them. &quot;We had a few holidays together. We went to Dubai with Axel and Olive and the kids. His passing hit hard, very hard. &quot;Luckily, I got to see Garrett about two and half years ago out here in Cape Town. It was brilliant to be able to speak to him again before he passed away.&quot;The inherent sadness will remain, but Payne has enough fond memories of both Munster men to ensure that he is still able to remember the good times.Back home in Cape Town, where Payne is now working in a family construction business, people still ask him what it was about Munster that made it so special. Seventeen years after first wearing the red jersey, he still struggles to put the province&rsquo;s unique aura into words.&quot;I knew there was something special about Munster, but I always viewed it from the outside when I was with Swansea,&quot; Payne says. &quot;That '04 to '08 period was a real golden era to be involved in. I really couldn&rsquo;t have asked for more. Our win-ratio was exceptional, we really had a good team. &quot;Every time we played at Thomond Park in the European Cup, the place was going off. You couldn't help but appreciate what was happening.&quot;I played Super 12 in South Africa, but at Munster, it was just a totally different atmosphere. &quot;We were getting paid to play, so obviously you had the professional aspect, but in many ways, it was like the old amateur days. &quot;There was a direct connection because the crowd and the team lived off one another. It was a community and that sense of belonging made it feel like the old days. You don&rsquo;t often associate that with professional sport. &quot;It really was a move I wish I had made four years earlier when I first came to Europe. I&rsquo;d have loved that.&quot;I loved those times. They were the best days of my life and I have memories that I will hold forever – for myself and my family.&quot;Munster's remarkable European odyssey came full circle in 2006 and Payne will forever be proud that he got to play his part.Considering he was signed at the same time as Christian Cullen, not many predicted that the South African would wear the No 15 jersey on the big days, instead of the All Blacks legend.&quot;It was very nerve-wracking having lost the two previous European finals by such narrow margins,&quot; Payne recalls. &quot;2006 was so special. It is a memory that will live long with me. When people ask me about it back here in south Africa, I still tell them the story about how the big screen cut back to all the people on O&rsquo;Connell Street.&quot;Payne's regret about not moving to Munster sooner also comes from a sense of what could have been at international level. The South African was Irish-qualified through his grandmother Esther Williams, who hailed from Sligo. Although Payne spent plenty of time in Ireland camp that illusive first cap evaded him.&quot;I was always made aware of my Irish roots,&quot; he explains. &quot;Grandma Esther was very proud to be Irish. She was a tough lady.&quot;When I joined Munster, I spent a few seasons training with the Ireland squad, but it never took off. That's why I'd have loved to have come to Ireland sooner to actually have a real crack at it.&quot;I was 30 at the time, but I got a call-up to the squad and trained in plenty of Six Nations squads, but it never happened, which is a bit of a regret. I would have loved to have come earlier and given it a full go.&quot;It's a regret in what was otherwise a hugely enjoyable nine years. As much as Payne continues to follow Munster&rsquo;s progress, nowadays rugby is a hobby rather than his profession. He is excited about the arrival of World Cup winners Damian De Allende and RG Snyman, who he believes can follow Paul O&rsquo;Connell&rsquo;s footsteps.&quot;The type of player that he is, I think he will definitely add to what Munster are trying to do,&quot; Payne enthuses.&quot;For me, he will fit quite nicely into the Munster mould. He is really mobile as well as really good in the lineout. He can be abrasive at times too.&quot;He is a bit of a Paulie (O&rsquo;Connell). I see quite a few similarities between Snyman and Paulie.&quot;Payne doesn't harbour any great desire to return to rugby. Five years working as Munster manager brought plenty of stress and while he enjoyed the challenges, he is happy to have turned the page. &quot;It wasn't an easy job,&quot; Payne says.&quot;There were ups and downs and huge pressure. As high as the highs are, the lows can often be even lower when you have poor results. I found that quite hard to deal with, especially in management.&quot;You don't get to spend time with your family. Rugby becomes your life. I have to admit, it has been good to spend more time with my kids. &quot;But we didn't leave Munster with any hard feelings. We left with heavy hearts because it was the best time of our lives.&quot;

This is without any doubt what a die hard Star Wars fans needs in their home, especially if they love to grill and are seriously dedicated to the franchise. Of course one might need to save up a bit since in US dollars this piece is around $1,720, give or take, and there's shipping to consider as well given that it can't be shipped as easily as other items. That might put kind of a damper on the whole idea, but a dedicated fan with the money will likely give it another thought at least and wonder if they really need to pay rent or the mortgage for the next month. A person can go without electricity for a month, yeah? This creation is absolutely solid and features the kind of grilling surface that might not be ideal for everyone, but the novelty of it is far more important than the function to be certain, even if it will get the job done without fail. as far as the function of the rest of the construct it does appear that the head might be more ornamental than anything, which could be a deal breaker for true grillers, but at the same time it's enough to be impressed by since someone took a great deal of time and effort to make this thing and needs to be recognized for it at least. One can easily guess that this type of a grill wouldn't be rolling off the assembly line unless it was cheap and cost effective to make, and could keep the unit price down to a thousand or less with added extras that were built into the construction of it. Even then the lesser cost might mean cheaper materials and a less worthy grill, which would make it more of a showpiece than anything, much as this is to be certain.

But you have to take the steps to plan you can't just sit back and I don't feel like you have to wait for them to call. You really have to be persistent and really be an advocate for yourself because there's just so many people going through this. So, you just really have to take the appropriate steps and really try getting what's owed to you."

China is finally seeing its new vehicle sales go back up for the first time in nearly two years, with all segments, including electric cars bouncing back, while Tesla experienced a steep drop in sales last month. Tesla Model 3 sales in China fell over 64 percent last month compared with March 2020. That fall happened despite a 9.8 percent month-on-month increase in "new energy vehicle" sales in China last month. All of this is happening as the Covid-19 crisis impact has started softening in China's economy and the world's largest auto market. But the industry's leading trade group warns that the fight isn't over. The China Association of Automobile Manufacturers CAAM, the country's largest auto industry association, expects the total to drop 15 percent this year -- from more than 25 million units sold in 2019. That will be the case even if the country continues to contain the coronavirus outbreak effectively. Much of that loss hit hard in the first quarter after the outbreak became China's national emergency in December. China's auto sales reached 2.07 million units last month, up 4.4 percent from a year earlier. During the month, sales of new energy vehicles NEVs fell for a tenth month to 72,000 units, CAAM reported. These NEV numbers include passenger and commercial battery electric, plug-in hybrid, and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. For total new vehicle sales, the numbers sank 79 percent in February and 43 percent in March. These sales were hit hard by Covid-19 as the government's strict stay-at-home orders kept buyers away. "The sales rebound in April fell short of expectations but ... will increase in the next two months" due to the release of pent-up demand as lockdown measures are further eased, CAAM official Xu Haidong said. Tesla's Model 3 is still the biggest EV seller in China this year, but the competitive pressure is mounting. Ford is finally seeing some gains and BYD took the lead last month. Tesla's Elon Musk is still ambitious about China's market, and expects Model 3 price cuts to help. The China Passenger Car Association CPCA reports that the BYD Qin EV took the lead with 5,096 units sold last month, followed by the Ford Escape 1.5T plug-in hybrid electric vehicle at 3,999; and the Tesla Model 3 came in at 3,635 units sold last month in China. Before April, Tesla had been breaking the market trends, being one of the only cars in the market seeing sales gains while the overall China market plummeted. CEO Elon Musk addressed concerns during the April 29 earnings call. Lowering the price of the Model 3 would be starting to happen, and should bring some of its competitiveness back. "We are making rapid progress on lowering the production cost in China, and we're actually excited to announce on this call that we will be reducing the price of the Standard Range Model 3 basically tomorrow China time," Musk said at that time, according to a transcript. "And that will be a price below the subsidy limit, and we feel confident that that will still be a vehicle that delivers good gross margin." Ford, Volkswagen, and other competitors, are hoping that the Chinese government keeps its generous purchase incentives in place. Last month, the government discussed reducing rebates even if it does keep its earlier commitment to extending the subsidy program another two years. The generous subsidies have been behind China being by far the largest global EV market for several years. Manufacturers worry that the global pandemic and plunging oil and vehicle fuel prices will undercut their significant investments made in EVs for that market. Musk has been counting on China being a good sign for investors to back further global growth -- such as another factory going into Europe. Tesla and competitors were ordered by China to lock down factory operations and stores temporarily earlier this year. Tesla's Shanghai factory, which started production in October last year, became the electric automaker's first plant located outside the US. The company was proud to begin delivering Model 3 cars to customers in China in January.  Musk has made it clear to local and state governments in California that he wants his Fremont plant reopened as soon as possible. The US market has been Tesla's foundation for stability and growth -- and expects that its upcoming Model Y compact crossover will help its financials. But the outlook could be dark for the American EV market. The Covid-19 pandemic won't be going away anytime soon, and drastically lower gasoline prices are having their effect on EV sales. Tesla and its competitors face a real double whammy in that key auto sales market. By Jon LeSage for Oilprice.com

There no gainsaying that the Return on the Individual reportis yet another compelling reason for investments in mental health. Lack of evidence is no longer an excuse. It is this regard that BasicNeeds-Ghana and many well- meaning organisations are drawing the attention of government to improve investments in mental health. The continued funding support of DFID/UKaid to Government of Ghana (GoG) and civil society organisations such as BasicNeeds- Ghana and the mental health user groups established should stir the government to complement those efforts. Comic Relief has also supported to campaign of the Ghana Speak Your Mind for Mental Health. COVID-19 has amply demonstrated the need to invest in mental health to help the citizens of the country overcome the fear and anxiety the pandemic has brought. As GoG fashions out its strategy to realising Universal Health Coverage, mental health should anchor all the strategies outlined to achieve this quest. The time to invest in mental health is now!

The Return on the Individual Report (ROI)launched virtually at the Chatham House , London,in the afternoon of Friday, 17th April 2020with over 500 participants pluggingvia zoom - another strategy to circumvent the challenge of having face-to-face meeting due to COVID-19 it was attended by the World Health Organisation (WHO) Director for Mental Health and Substance Use Disorders, Dr. Devora Kerstel, the Chief Executive Officer of Unilever, Allan Jope, Myrna Cabotaje, Minister of Health of the Philippines, and Josephine Karwah, a mental health service user and Ebola Survivor from Liberia. The launch was moderated by Robert Yates of Chatham House. ROI is simply making the point that any and every investment made should go beyond considering the financial return but more of the benefits to the wellbeing of the individual. The ROI is seeking a paradigm shift from the long-held thought(s) of investment being in monetary value rather than the long-term gains that will accrue on the individual - better health and active contribution to productivity, incomes and payment of taxes, participation in decision-making and a general wellbeing. This report takes further an earlier reportlaunched at the 2016 World Bank Group Spring Meeting in Washington DC, which was a collaborative efforts of the World Bank, theWHO,Grand Challenges Canada and National Institutes of Health of United States of America which established that there is a fourfold financial return on every one United States Dollar (or the equivalent of that in any currency) invested in mental health.TheReturn On Investment report also highlighted the projectedcost to loss of productivity due to mental illnessbeing 10 billion days annually which translates to a trillion United States Dollars.

Some shale oil companies in the United States have begun to reopen wells they had shut in earlier in response to the low oil prices, Energy Transfer said in a conference call this week, as quoted by Bloomberg. About a quarter of the wells halted in the Permian are not back online, Energy Transfer's chief commercial officer Mackie McCrea said, noting that the number of shut-in wells in the shale play account for some 8 percent of the total. There could be a purely practical reason for that rather than a reason to believe prices are rising sustainably. The longer an oil well is shut in, the more uncertain it becomes whether it will be able to resume production, according to experts. This is especially true about shale oil wells there is a ton of expertise on how to shut in a conventional oil well and avoid loss of production. Shale oil wells, however, are a new thing even if the technology itself is not new. A shut-in for a couple of weeks would not do any damage, according to experts, but anything longer could be risky. Meanwhile, some shale oil producers are cutting production further, Bloomberg wrote, notably Continental Resources and Callon Petroleum. Curtailment plans by different companies announced last month added up to a further reduction of 600,000 bpd in U.S. production. And yet some producers are ready to start expanding output again when West Texas Intermediate reaches $25 and, presumably, stays there for more than a day. Among these, Bloomberg reported earlier this month, were Parsley Energy, Centennial Resource Development, and Diamondback Energy. Interestingly, Parsley Energy was among the supporters of a mandatory production cut in Texas. WTI is now close to $25 a barrel, recording a string of five consecutive daily gains last week. This rally came on the back of returning optimism about demand as lockdowns in Europe and the U.S. begin to be eased. Analysts, however, have warned against too much optimism as the problem with a massive supply overhang and limited storage capacity remains. By Irina Slav for Oilprice.com

Soooooo, can it be too dangerous for regular students to repopulate campus but too costly for football players to stay home? Emmert says nope.

 Say this much, that’s consistency. The NCAA chases the absurd to assure athletes receive no better treatment than regular students. At least athletes can’t receive worse treatment, in the NCAA president’s way of thinking.
 His opinion has no legislative force, but at least he put the nagging voice of conscience on one shoulder. Money talks from the other shoulder.
