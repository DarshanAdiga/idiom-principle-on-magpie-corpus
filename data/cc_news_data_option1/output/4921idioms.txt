CHICAGO (AP) — President-elect Joe Biden is considering former Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel to serve as his transportation secretary. Biden’s pick to lead the Transportation Department is not believed to be imminent, and Emanuel is among multiple candidates in the running for the Cabinet position. That's according to people familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the private deliberations. But Emanuel is a substantial and somewhat divisive figure in Democratic Party politics. Some party progressives are critical of Emanuel's handling of the police shooting death of a Black teen, Laquan McDonald, by a white police officer when Emanuel was mayor.

Eso le dice al empleado que lo estan observando, indico.Es importante hablar con ellos, crear seguridad y crear la escucha asertiva, generar compañerismos pero sin caer en exceso de confianza, apunto, Si los tratas mal, el no me pagan bien, la empresa gana mucho dinero; si no los entiendes, no les generas seguridad, tendras un enemigo trabajando contigo, insistio Maya Sanchez.Explico que se le denomina robo hormiga al hurto que comienza con un objeto pequeño, como una pluma, mismo que puede aumentar hasta cosas de mayor volumen. "Muchas veces el mismo empleado se da cuenta de como robar, si no hay una disciplina al interior, puede darse este delito, advirtio el Oficial.Recomendo que, en las entrevistas con el nuevo personal, se debe de hablar de valores los cuales motiven al trabajador a sentirse seguro con su labor. De acuerdo con un estudio correspondiente al año 2018 por parte de la Asociacion Nacional de Tiendas de Autoservicio y Departamentales (ANTAD), se registro un aumento al 60 % en este delito al interior de empresas y negocios.

Representatives state it is the only site where holiday pay is excluded from annual working hour calculations, adding that Croda has acknowledged the mistake, offering to settle with staff in February.
 However, it was described as “not reflecting adequate compensation for the amount of holiday pay lost,” with some having clocked up 21 years’ service.
 Unite regional officer Mick Simpson: “Croda’s shift workers are at the end of their tether over years of missing holiday pay they are legally entitled to, with some long serving staff owed thousands.
 “The strike ballot shouldn’t come as a bolt from the blue for the company. Croda has previously acknowledged the holiday pay issue, but other than an unsatisfactory offer which would have left staff out of pocket, nothing has been done to put it right. Making the situation particularly galling is the fact that holiday pay for shift workers at all of Croda’s other sites is calculated differently.
 “Our members would much rather settle this dispute amicably. Unite urges Croda to put forward a realistic compensation package and incorporate annual leave into shift rotas going forward. Not to do so risks strike action that will severely hamper Croda’s ability to operate as well as force Unite to seek redress for our members through the legal system.”

CHICAGO (AP) — President-elect Joe Biden is considering former Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, a substantial and somewhat divisive figure in Democratic Party politics, to serve as his transportation secretary. Biden’s selection of his nominee to lead the Transportation Department is not believed to be imminent and Emanuel is among multiple candidates in the running for the Cabinet position, according to people familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the private deliberations. But his candidacy threatens to pull at the divisions among Democrats that Biden has largely managed to avoid as he begins to fill out his administration. Progressive leaders, including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, have been especially vocal in criticizing the prospect of Emanuel joining the Cabinet. Emanuel, a former three-term congressman who served as Barack Obama’s first White House chief of staff and was a senior adviser in Bill Clinton’s administration, has been a significant force in Democratic Party politics for much of the last three decades. He also turned reviving Chicago’s ragged public transportation system and overhauling the city’s two busy, worn airports into a top issue during his eight years as mayor. Emanuel is also credited with making Chicago one of the most bicycle-friendly cities in country during his time in office. But selecting Emanuel could be a tough sell to some in the progressive wing of the Democratic Party who are critical of his handling of the high-profile police shooting death of Laquan McDonald, a Black teen killed by a white police officer, during his time as Chicago’s mayor. Whether Emanuel is ultimately picked could also be affected by other factors as Biden has placed a premium on building out a Cabinet and team of senior advisers from a diverse...

But that sense of normalcy will be hard to come by as every team prepares for what could be the most unique season ever.
 TITLE FAVORITES
 Shanksville, which won its first district title since 1978 last season, returns four starters to a team eyeing a repeat in Class A. They will have to do it under the direction of a new coach, but luckily for the Vikings, it is a familiar face in former assistant and longtime Shanksville boys coach, Robert Snyder.
 One of the only glaring issues for a team that went 24-5 last year is roster depth. With just eight players led by cousins Josie Snyder and Rylee Snyder, avoiding major injury and utilizing all eight players’ strengths will be keys to the Vikings mirroring their success from last season.
 Another team that went through a coaching change in the offseason was Shade.
 Last year, Shade finished 18-8 and lost to district runner-up Tussey Mountain in the Class A semifinals, before closing its season with a loss to Berlin in the third-place game.
 The Panthers graduated two seniors, but bring back senior point guard Taylor Rapsky and sophomore forward Jenna Muha.
 “I have five lettermen returning, three starters. We’re not going to reinvent the wheel,” said Satkovich about his team being a factor in both the conference and district standings. “These girls have a lot of potential. They just came off a very good volleyball season. They’re excited to play, and I’m excited to coach them.”
 Meanwhile, in Class AA, Windber will look to avenge two consecutive district championship losses.
 The Ramblers and coach Cory Pavlosky hope a more-balanced, well-rounded roster can help put them over the hump and win their first title since the 2017-18 season.
 “It’s a different squad,” said Pavlosky. “We’ve had 1,000-point scorers the past however many years. This year, I think it’s going to be a really good team flow. Gina (Gaye) and Sam (Toki) are back healthy. We still have (Amanda) Cominsky, Kylie Ashbrook, who had a heck of a season last year as a power forward, mixed with some of those younger generation girls. It’s going to be a good season, hopefully.”
 IN THE MIDDLE
 Last season, Berlin dealt with the hiccups that come with a younger roster, one year removed from a team that won the PIAA Class A championship in 2018.

WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) — With unemployment still high and the pandemic threatening yet another economic slump, President-elect Joe Biden is assembling a team of liberal advisers who have long focused on the nation’s workers and government efforts to address economic inequality.Janet Yellen, announced Monday as&nbsp;Biden’s nominee for treasury secretary,&nbsp;served as chair of the Federal Reserve from 2014 to 2018, when she placed a&nbsp;greater emphasis than previous Fed chairs&nbsp;on maximizing employment and less focus on price inflation. Biden also named Cecilia Rouse as chair of his Council of Economic Advisers, and Heather Boushey and Jared Bernstein as members of the council.All are outspoken supporters of more government stimulus spending to boost growth, a major issue with the coronavirus pandemic cramping the U.S. economy.Those choices “signal the desire of the Biden administration to take the CEA in a direction that really centers on working people and raising wages,” said Heidi Shierholz, senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute and former Labor Department chief economist during the Obama administration.Biden’s nominees are also a more personally diverse group than those of previous presidents.The potential senior economic advisers include liberal economists and policy specialists who established their credentials during the previous two Democratic administrations.Yellen, if confirmed by the Senate, would be the first woman to serve as treasury secretary, after breaking ground as the first woman to chair the Fed. Rouse would be the first Black woman to lead the CEA in its 74 years of existence. And Neera Tanden, Biden’s pick for director of the Office of Management and Budget, would be the first South Asian American in that job.Biden also selected Wally Adeyemo to be Yellen’s deputy, which would make him the first Black deputy treasury secretary. Rouse, Tanden and Adeyemo will all require Senate confirmation, and Tanden in particular is already drawing heavy Republican criticism.Along with its progressive cast, Biden’s team also has years of experience in government and policymaking. And that’s earning plaudits from some conservatives, who note that the nominees are not a far- left group bent on strangling the economy, as President Donald Trump repeatedly warned during the 2020 campaign.“They are intellectual liberals, but not burn-it-all-down socialists,” said Brian Riedl, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute and an adviser to Sen. Mitt Romney’s presidential campaign. “They’re fairly conventional liberal economists and experts.”Still, the Biden administration’s ambitious goals will face solid opposition from Republicans in Congress. The GOP needs to win one of two Georgia Senate seats in a Jan. 5 special election to retain control of the Senate, and the Republicans made major inroads on Nov. 3 in the Democrats’ House majority.“Most of the policies that Biden ran on will not survive a Republican Senate,” Riedl said. Those include proposals to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour and significantly increase taxes on wealthy Americans.Biden could secure another round of stimulus spending early next year, particularly if the recent spikes in confirmed virus cases push the economy into recession again. But such a package will likely have to come in under $1 trillion to get Senate Republican support, Riedl said, rather than the higher figure House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is seeking.Tanden is the president and CEO of the liberal think tank Center for American Progress and was the director of domestic policy for the Obama-Biden presidential campaign. She first made her mark in the Clinton orbit, and served as policy director for Hillary Clinton’s 2008 presidential race.A spokesman for GOP Sen. John Cornyn of Texas tweeted that Tanden “stands zero chance of being confirmed” as budget director, citing “an an endless stream of disparaging comments about” Republican senators. And Josh Holmes, a political adviser to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, tweeted that her confirmation was likely doomed.Brian Deese, a former senior economic adviser in the Obama administration and now the managing director and global head of sustainable investing at BlackRock, is expected to be named director of the White House National Economic Council, according to a person familiar with transition plans who was not authorized to speak publicly on the matter.Deese worked on the auto bailout and environmental issues in the Obama White House, where he held the title of deputy director of both the NEC and the OMB.Deese and Adeyemo are both under fire from progressives for their connections to BlackRock, a giant Wall Street asset management firm. BlackRock has sought to avoid greater regulatory scrutiny by Treasury. And many activists assail the firm for owning huge stakes in oil and gas companies.Rouse, a labor economist and head of Princeton University’s School of Public and International Affairs, served on the CEA from 2009 to 2011, and served on the NEC from 1998 to 1999 in the Clinton administration.Notably, she organized a letter earlier this year signed by more than 100 economists calling for more government action to help Americans caused by the coronavirus pandemic.“The planning for a fairer economy, grounded in facts and evidence, begins now,” Rouse tweeted Monday.Alan Blinder, former vice chair of the Fed and a currently an economics professor at Princeton, praised Rouse’s management style and her expertise in the economics of education and workforce training. Biden has proposed making two years of community college tuition-free.“That kind of stuff is right in her wheelhouse,” Blinder said.Boushey, picked to be one of the three members of the CEA, is president and co-founder of the Washington Center for Equitable Growth, a think tank focused on inequality. The center conducts its own research and also provides grants to mostly left-leaning academics to study aspects of inequality.Bernstein, also nominated for the CEA, was an adviser to then-Vice President Biden during the Obama administration before becoming a fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning think tank. Bernstein has also worked as a social worker and was an economist at the Economic Policy Institute, a labor-supported think tank.___Associated Press writers Alexandra Jaffe, Paul Wiseman and Michael Balsamo contributed to this report.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.

CHARLESTON, S.C. (WCSC) - The City of Charleston has opened the door to its first city-run warming center in years.The facility on Fishburne Street is equipped with 80 cots, each six feet apart, with separate areas for men, women and families. It also has the capacity to house several people in isolated areas in case they have symptoms consistent with COVID-19.In addition to beds with pillows, blankets and sheets, volunteers are also providing guests with drinks, dinner and breakfast the next morning.The facility is open from 8 p.m. to 7 a.m. at which time guests will be required to leave so the warming center can return to its normal operation as a community center.Chris Jardin is the community liaison and homelessness coordinator for the city. He is in charge of the warming center.Jardin says they are filling a need normally met by local churches. Data collected last year from the churches showed an average of 55 people stayed at a warming center each day.“There have been a lot of changes to our communities because of the pandemic. One of the impacts is the faith communities that historically take on this effort have not be able to do so,” Jardin said. “It was a well utilized service. Over 900 people used the service last year.”Hibben United Methodist Church in Mount Pleasant puts together a warming center every year, but this year associate pastor Walter Strawther had to pull the plug on the service. He says there were a lot of factors that went into the decision.“A major part of it is transportation. Most of the guests are from the downtown area and we would use the church bus to transport them. Obviously, with the coronavirus and trying to social distance we could only get four or five of them at a time,” Strawther said.Having the warming center located on the peninsula at the Arthur W. Christopher Community Center helped shorten the distance guests would have to travel to make it to the facility. Strawther says having CARTA offer free rides to the center does not hurt either.One of the big concerns for Strawther was the health of this volunteers.“A lot of our volunteers are older so we were concerned about them getting the coronavirus and the worst happening,” Strawther said. “It just became increasingly clear that we would not be able to open our warming center the way we would have wanted.”Instead, Strawther is acting as an advisor for the city’s facility and offering all of the volunteers willing to put themselves out there despite the risk, something the city is trying to mitigate as much as possible.“We will be temperature checking and symptom checking at the door and each guest will be issued a mask,” Jardin said. “If folks have mild symptoms, they’ll be put in isolation. . . It’s not an ideal scenario but we are doing our best to keep everyone as safe as possible.”In a normal year, they would be able to fit twice as many cots in a space this size, but it is not a normal year. Still, Jardin says they did not have to reinvent the wheel to keep people safe.“A lot of this is modeled after all the work that was done on shelters for hurricanes which, thankfully, we didn’t have to use this year but a lot of the conversation about how to do concrete sheltering was had earlier in the year,” Jardin said.Both Jardin and Strawther says despite the risk of the coronavirus, getting people off the streets amid near freezing temperatures needs to be a priority.“These are human beings, plain and simple,” Strawther said. “Human decency says we should provide whenever we can.”Next on the priority list for Jardin is getting the ability to do rapid covid tests.

A good friend, Ed Eaton once wrote about Mark saying: _If you are ever tempted to give Mark a gift certificate, don’t get one from the Bon Marche or Sak’s Fifth Avenue. Oh, he wouldn’t throw it away. He doesn’t throw anything away. He would give it to his wife, Linda. His gift should be from Boeing Surplus, B and B Auto parts, or South End Wrecking. Better, yet, it should be for money to spend at a government surplus auction. He’ll buy a whole pallet of what a lot of people would call junk. It’s not junk to Mark. He may not know what everything on the pallet is. Something in the block of goods will appeal to him and be the reason for his bid. But the stuff that is new to him he’ll figure out what it is, fix it if it’s worth it and either use it or sell it, or take it apart and sell the pieces. If it has a motor, he 'll build something that needs a motor. He’ll throw the aluminum on his pile that he trucks to the recycler every once in a while where he sells it for more than he paid for it to get funds for the next auction._

DECATUR, Ala. (WAFF) - A new campus for the Alabama Institute for Deaf and Blind is in the works for north Alabama.Governor Ivey announced over $298 million has been awarded to twenty Public School and College Authority projects.Twenty-eight million will be used to fund the AIDB north campus at the Lurleen B. Wallace Development Center in Decatur.The facility will be used by the AIBD to educate students and adults who are blind, visually impaired, deaf or multi-disabled.Executive Director of Special Projects, Dennis Gilliam, said they currently serve over 400 students at their Talladega campus and could use the additional campus.“The ability to add a northern campus just gives us the opportunity to have a satellite location, so that those services are not so far away from so many of the Alabamian that we serve across the state,” said Gilliam.Twenty plus buildings will be renovated on the 160-acre campus and will include a wide range of programs.“Some of those new services will be short term programs for those students that have vision loss, a lot of STEM activities and certifications trainings that we plan to do onsite,” said Gilliam.The site was most recently used by the Alabama National Guard as a training facility.Gilliam said it could take about 18 months before the renovations are complete and they will be able to open the campus.Copyright 2020 WAFF.

Workers on the front lines of a pandemic that has killed more than 266,000 people in the United States and infected more than 13 million others are recognized in the Red Room with a Christmas tree dotted with handmade ornaments, as well as other decorations around the parlor.
 The gingerbread White House — a sweet confection made of more than 400 pounds (181 kilograms) of dough, gum paste, chocolate and royal icing — is on display in the State Dining Room and for the first time includes the Rose Garden, which the first lady recently renovated, and the First Ladies’ Garden.
 Ornaments on the official White House Christmas tree in the Blue Room — a Fraser fir from Shepherdstown, West Virginia, that stands more than 18 feet (5.49 meters) tall — were designed by students who were asked by the National Park Service to depict what makes their states beautiful.
 A buck and a crane are featured in three-dimensional art hanging in windows of the Green Room, where American wildlife is the highlight. Classical urns lining an East Wing walkway hold groupings of foliage from different regions of the country.
 Trees and other decorations in the East Room feature planes, trains and automobiles — including models of Air Force One — in a nod to triumphs in innovations and technology. Wrapped gifts beneath decorated trees lining the Cross Hall bear tags that say “peace,” “love,” “faith” and “joy.”
 Monday’s unveiling of the Christmas decor came weeks after Mrs. Trump was heard on an audio recording using profanity as she complained about the pressure of having to decorate for the holiday in the past. The recording of the July 2018 conversation was made and released to CNN by Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, who was fired from the White House earlier that year.
 Wolkoff published a tell-all book about her friendship and breakup with Mrs. Trump, whom Wolkoff blames for not defending her after questions arose about spending for Trump’s 2017 inauguration, which Wolkoff helped produce.
 This year some 125 volunteers from around the country used 62 trees, 106 wreaths, more than 1,200 feet (366 meters) of garland, more than 3,200 strands of lights and 17,000 bows to decorate the 132-room White House over the course of Thanksgiving weekend.
 The library is decorated to recognize the 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment, giving women the right to vote. Stockings for the president, first lady and their 14-year-old son Barron hang from a fireplace in the room where presidential china patterns are displayed.
 After previewing the decorations for the media, the White House on Monday planned the first of many holiday receptions that are expected to be smaller in size given coronavirus concerns.
 A few miles north of the White House, the wrapping also came off the Christmas decorations at Vice President Mike Pence’s official residence on the grounds of the Naval Observatory.
 Karen Pence said “Old Fashioned Christmas” is their theme. The home is decorated with natural and rustic elements, including pine cones, seasonal berries, burlap, galvanized aluminum and plaid ribbon, along with seven Christmas trees and 35 wreaths.

CHICAGO (AP) — President-elect Joe Biden is considering former Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, a substantial and somewhat divisive figure in Democratic Party politics, to serve as his transportation secretary.
 Biden’s selection of his nominee to lead the Transportation Department is not believed to be imminent and Emanuel is among multiple candidates in the running for the Cabinet position, according to people familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the private deliberations.
 But his candidacy threatens to pull at the divisions among Democrats that Biden has largely managed to avoid as he begins to fill out his administration. Progressive leaders, including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, have been especially vocal in criticizing the prospect of Emanuel joining the Cabinet.
 Emanuel, a former three-term congressman who served as Barack Obama’s first White House chief of staff and was a senior adviser in Bill Clinton’s administration, has been a significant force in Democratic Party politics for much of the last three decades.
 He also turned reviving Chicago’s ragged public transportation system and overhauling the city’s two busy, worn airports into a top issue during his eight years as mayor. Emanuel is also credited with making Chicago one of the most bicycle-friendly cities in country during his time in office.

 However Mr Sephton said last year’s decision to steer clear of the Sealand village resulted mainly from a shortage of volunteers.

 “This incident won’t stop the Santa float returning to the area,” insisted Mr Sephton.

Sega has a few video game franchises that are, quite frankly, underrated. I personally believe the Yakuza games are a great example of this, and even Sega themselves admit that the series is aimed at a "niche market."
 The thing is though, based on the latest figures released by the company during its annual integrated report, sales of Yakuza games have seen a huge rise over the past two years, with over 14 million copies sold across all games to date.
 The series had sold 11 million as of 2018, and 12 million in 2019 - which means sales have seemingly doubled over the last 12 months - and 20% of all lifetime sales have occurred in just the last two years alone. Not bad for a 15-year-old game franchise.
    Sega believes the niche appeal of the game, and the portrayal of Japanese culture is the reason for the turnaround. In the past, Sega has felt that the game wouldn't hit with western audiences, but now consider it's Japanese origins are a major selling point in the west.
 In-fact, Sega is finding new success across the board releasing previously Japanese-only content to Western audiences. According to the report, the content is "highly evaluated by overseas users," and that the push of "Made in Japan" content int he west is proving successful.

Long’s first trial ended in a mistrial but she was convicted of murder in 2005. She wasn’t sent to jail until losing an appeal in 2009 and spent seven years behind bars before being freed in 2016 after the Riverside County judge reversed the conviction.
 The Riverside County district attorney’s office will review the Supreme Court decision before deciding whether to seek a retrial, spokesman John Hall told the Orange County Register.
 Long, 45, said she remembers “breaking down” after hearing that the Supreme Court had overturned her conviction.
 “I feel like justice is finally being served,” she told the Register.

For Adams though, the land is more than a home. It is his heritage that he feels compelled to be a good steward of and protect. The house where he lives with his wife was built by his grandparents, but his family’s ties to the land stretch back even further.
 His family came from Ireland and first settled in Kentucky, where Adams’ great-great-great-great-grandfather made his home after fighting in the Revolutionary War. His sons made their way to Indiana, before one of their sons, Adams’ great-grandfather, settled in what is now Martinsville. In 1875, he bought an 80-acre tract of land, and then three years later, he bought another 80 acres on the other side of the road. That second track, which has been continuously in the family ever since, is where Adams now lives, making it 142 years members of his family have lived and worked on tract.
 Adams moved onto the land for the first time after high school and quickly fell in love with the way of life. He hunted and fished with his grandfather and helped him with his landscape business before enlisting in the Army and then going to college to become a veterinarian.
 “I guess I became sort of an Indiana homebody at a very young age. Whereas my other siblings traveled different locations and had different pursuits in life,” Adams said. “Being raised my whole life up to that point in urban environments or cities, I sort of gravitated away from that toward the country lifestyle and that whole heritage thing.”
 After college, he rejoined the Army as a commissioned officer in the veterinary corps, but his connection to the land never left him. As a young major in the early 1990s, he decided to ensure the land that meant so much to him would stay in the family for at least one more generation as the first of the two 80-acre plots had already been sold to become a subdivision. He worked out a deal with his grandmother and bought the remaining acres from her in three segments.
 “I had a strong interest, almost verging on obligation, in my mind to keep this property in the family and I hope one of my children will do the same and land here at some point, too, if not two or three of them,” Adams said. “They could all settle on this property if they really wanted.”
 It was not enough to just own the land, though. He learned from his grandparents that he also had to care for the land. His grandmother had one timber harvest in the years after his grandfather died, and after buying the land, Adams brought in a forester to see what needed to be done. That led to a second small harvest of mostly walnut being completed on the roughly 40 acres of forest that encircle the farmed fields. The rule of thumb is that you should check on the woods every 10 to 15 years, he said, so when he retired from the Army, he once again brought in a forester to see what should be done.

Marcus Carr scored 26 points, including the game-winning 3-pointer with 2.7 seconds left, and Minnesota beat Loyola Marymount 67-64 on Monday night.
 Carr had 28 points on Saturday when the Golden Gophers (3-0) defeated the Lions 88-73.
 LMU (1-2) had tied the game at 64 when Keli Leaupepe turned an offensive rebound into a three-point play with 23.3 seconds remaining.
 Carr dribbled the clock down to just above the key before attempting to penetrate the right side as the time dipped below 10 seconds. Finding his path blocked by Jalin Anderson, Carr stepped back and buried the winner.

ATHENS, Ill. (WAND) - Authorities warned the public against airsoft guns that look like real weapons after seizing one of them Monday.
 According to the Menard County Sheriff's Office, Athens police responded to a reported disturbance where someone allegedly displayed a firearm. Police found the suspects and confiscated the weapon. Menard County deputies assisted at the scene.
 The airsoft gun had the appearance of a real gun and had what appeared to be live ammunition in the magazine, which turned out to be fake. Authorities said these types of items presented a "very serious safety issue."
 "When officers/deputies arrive on a scene they are often faced with split- second decisions," deputies said. "Imagine an officer/deputy being faced with an individual possessing the weapon shown below. Please don’t turn an already difficult situation into a terrible one by carrying or possessing items like this. Something like this could have easily turned into a tragedy."
 Athens police are continuing to investigate.

Logic would dictate personalized plates reflect the opinions of the person paying for them. Courtroom logic is still all over the place, thanks mainly to the fact the government prints the plates. Is a normal plate -- one obtained after all personalized attempts are rejected -- compelled speech? Probably not. But there's definitely a First Amendment argument to be made that rejecting "offensive" personalized plates is the government deciding only certain forms of car-specific speech are acceptable.

"articleBody" : "The New Jersey Turnpike Authority (NJTA) is plowing more money into keeping new service area construction on target, agreeing to spend up to another $10 million on behalf of a company that said it had been hampered by revenue losses because of the coronavirus. That company, HMSHost, came under fire after the NJTA agreed in March it would temporarily fund up to $40 million in construction costs. A union revealed at the time that HMS' parent company had financed $35 million in stock buy backs. On Nov. 24, NJTA commissioners voted to pay the additional money in service area construction costs to HMSHost, which will eventually have to repay the funds. HMSHost agreed in 2017 to a $250 million plan to replace most of the New Jersey Turnpike and Garden State Parkway service area buildings in exchange for a 25-year franchise to operate service centers on both toll roads. In March, the company asked the Turnpike Authority to pay up to $40 million to cover those service area construction costs because it lost revenue during the early days of the coronavirus pandemic. Commissioners agreed to the deal to prevent delays on the construction of new service area buildings at the Vince Lombardi and Richard Stockton Service Areas on the Turnpike and the Forked River Service Area on the Parkway. The extra funds are needed to cover construction change orders totaling $6.5 million to do work that the state's Department of Community Affairs said was necessary to issue temporary certificates of occupancy that will allow the new service areas to open, NJTA officials said. "This unanticipated work will require that an additional $10 million be processed to pay Vericon Construction [the contractor] for the completed, but unanticipated work," Richard Fischer, NJTA's chief engineer, wrote in a memo. Vericon Construction is headquartered in Mountainside, N.J. The work included "unforeseen site conditions and replacement of additional deteriorated curbing, additional paving, sidewalk, stairways, drainage, and utility installation not anticipated" in the original agreement, he wrote. In April, the Autogrill Group, an Italian-based catering company and parent company of HMSHost, said it experienced an "80 percent and 90 percent worldwide revenue drop due to COVID-19 worldwide during the last week of March" and took steps including reducing worker hours, negotiating rent with landlords and "suspension of all non-essential expenditures." However, the NJTA also experienced revenue losses because of reduced traffic caused by COVID-19. For the first 10 months of 2020, NJTA revenues were $255 million below 2020 budgeted revenue, said Donna Manuelli, the authority's CFO. Under the March agreement, HMSHost "will be given time" to repay the authority, said Tom Feeney, an authority spokesman. HMSHost must begin repaying the money starting in January or when sales in any three consecutive months reach 85 percent of sales made during the same months in 2019, whichever comes first, he said. The company will repay the now $50 million the Authority paid to contractors for HMSHost's share of the costs, plus an additional sum between $300,000 and $450,000, depending on how quickly it makes repayment, Feeney said.",
