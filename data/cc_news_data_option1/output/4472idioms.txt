 # Puerto Rico, other islands brace for likely tropical storm

 The Associated Press
 SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) " A weather system heading for the eastern Caribbean was predicted to develop into a tropical storm on Wednesday as forecasters warned Puerto Rico and other islands to prepare for the possibility of dangerous heavy rains and strong winds.
 The U.S. National Hurricane Center said the storm was expected to move over or near the Leeward Islands on Wednesday and Puerto Rico on Wednesday night, then brush the northern shores of Hispaniola the following day while on a path that could take it to the U.S. mainland by the weekend.
 But the center also cautioned that it was too early to pinpoint what the system would do. 'It cannot be stressed enough that since the system is still in the formative stage, greater than average uncertainty exists regarding both the short-term and longer-term track and intensity forecasts,' its advisory said.
 Forecasters issued tropical storm warnings for Puerto Rico, the British and U.S. Virgin Islands, Antigua, Barbuda, Dominica, Martinique, Montserrat, St. Kitts and Nevis, Guadeloupe, Martinique, St. Martin, St. Maarten, Saba, St. Eustatius and portions of the Dominican Republic. A tropical storm warning means that tropical storm conditions are expected within within 36 hours.
 The forecast warned the islands could experience 3 to 6 inches (8 to 15 cm) of rainfall, with up to 10 inches (25 cm) in isolated spots.
 Officials in Puerto Rico expressed concern about the potential for landslides and flooding and urged people to take precautions. They noted the U.S. territory is struggling with a spike in coronavirus cases while also still recovering from 2017's devastating Hurricane Maria and a string of earthquakes earlier this year that damaged or destroyed hundreds of homes in the island's south.
 'We're not facing a situation like Maria, but we have to remain wary,' said Pedro Janer, secretary of the Department of Public Safety.
 At a news conference, Gov. Wanda Vázquez predicted the storm would cause power outages. Puerto Rico's power grid was destroyed by Maria and the rebuilt system is fragile and susceptible to failures. Earlier Tuesday, the island's power company and union leaders said electricity failed briefly for more than 450,000 customers when a plant was knocked offline for unknown reasons.
 The governor said that more than 300 shelters across the island were prepared to receive people if needed and that more than 130,000 face masks were available.
 'We've lived through several emergencies at one time,' Vázquez said. 'I want you to remain calm.'
 Late Tuesday night, the storm system had maximum sustained winds of 40 mph (65 kph). It was centered 235 miles (380 kilometers) southeast of the Leeward Islands and moving west-northwest at 25 mph (41 kph).

With new lockdown restrictions in effect across England as of Thursday November 5, this means you are now unfortunately prohibited from meeting people indoors socially. But did you know you can still meet outside? You are currently allowed to visit outdoors public places with those either from your household or someone in your support bubble, provided you follow social distancing guidelines. Outdoor public places include parks, beaches, the countryside and public gardens. Here's nine of our favourite spots across the county that provide you with great views - and somewhere to sit - this autumn. Alton Water, Tattingstone Following the recent Government announcement, Suffolk's Alton Park will remain open for the foreseeable future. With both the tracks and play parks open, there are a number of benches dotted around the park's reservoir - providing you with some idyllic views of this vast stretch of water. The main track around the water is eight miles in length and is used by both walkers and cyclists. During wet weather, the path can become muddy, so remember to bring wellies for your socially- distanced meet. If you're looking to grab a quick bite to eat or a hot drink to warm you up, Alton Park's cafe will be providing a takeaway service, serving a selection of homemade treats and locally-sourced refreshments to-go. National Trust woodlands, Pin Mill Tucked behind the Butt and Oyster pub in Pin Mill is an area of National Trust woodlands that is certainly a sight to behold. This slightly hilly route is currently covered in autumnal hues aplenty - but can be a bit boggy, so make sure you have wellies or waterproof shoes on. About halfway through the two-mile trail you'll come across a bench that faces the River Orwell, overlooking a number of house boats gently bobbing up and down on the water. If you decide to carry on walking, you'll eventually make your way towards a small beach area that's covered in sea plants a variety of birds. Christchurch Park, Ipswich If you're still having to head into the office this month, why not catch some fresh air on your lunch break by heading to Ipswich's Christchurch Park? Close to the centre of town, it's the ideal spot to meet someone from your support bubble for a brief socially-distanced meet to help you break up the day. Simply make your way towards the bottom of the park (which can be accessed via the entrance on Fonnereau Road), and there you will find a number of benches facing the war memorial. With the architectural wonder that is Christchurch Park behind you, the pond to your right and a number of ancient broadleaf trees surrounding you, you'll be glad you got out for a quick breather. If you're feeling a tad peckish, make a pit stop at the Tea Room at Christchurch Mansion (which can be accessed from the park). Open seven days a week between 10.30an and 3.30pm, it will be serving takeaway hot drinks and snacks such as sausage rolls and scones. Felixstowe Ferry Venture just a couple of miles northeast of Felixstowe and you'll arrive at Felixstowe Ferry, an ideal spot to help you watch the world go by this autumn. There are a number of benches located at Felixstowe Ferry that face out towards both the sea and Bawdsey Manor across the River Deben estuary - providing you with a much-needed slice of coastal peace and quiet during this portion of lockdown. Be sure to bring a pair of binoculars and a flask of hot tea or coffee with you so you can birdwatch as you natter away on your socially-distanced meet. Clare Country Park, Clare Dubbed Suffolk's most diverse country park, Clare Country Park near Sudbury is a great place to visit for a quick walk and a sit down this month. Open seven days a week, this 36-acre park is filled with plenty of benches, giving you ample opportunity to get back to nature as you hang out with your household or sensibly meet with someone from your social bubble. Be sure to head next to the mound - located in the west end of the park, you can enjoy views of the historic 13th century Clare Castle over in the distance. If you're looking for something warming, the park's cafe will be open six days a week (closed on Mondays) between 9am and 3.30pm, serving hot drinks, bacon and sausage baps, paninis and toasties on a takeaway-only basis. Brandon Country Park With over 30 acres of parkland to ramble through, Brandon Country Park is filled with open heathland, green forests and gorgeous views all around. You'll be spoilt for choice this autumn as you will be able to meet someone from your social bubble on picnic benches either by the lake, near the cafe or inside the historic walled garden. Open every day of the year from dawn to dusk, you and your family will also be able to grab some to-go refreshments from the Copper Beech Tearoom. Open between 10am and 3.30pm, last hot food orders are at 2.30pm. Abbey Gardens, Bury St Edmunds Situated in the heart of Bury St Edmunds is Abbey Gardens, an award-winning 14-acre space that sits on the site of a former Benedictine Abbey. Ideal for a socially-distanced meet, there's plenty of space to ensure you don't cross paths with anyone else, while ensuring you're able to still get outside for a much-needed breather during lockdown. With benches aplenty in the centre of the gardens, you can enjoy a rest and a natter as you gaze upon the towering St Edmundsbury Cathedral. Polstead Nip to the picturesque village of Polstead - located on the edge of Dedham Vale - for a quick escape to the country this season. Atop the grassy mound is a wooden bench that is perfect to rest on as you soak up the simply stunning views that overlook Box Valley. As you descend down the hill, you'll find yourself ending up at Bell's Hill corner. Felixstowe Beach, Felixstowe If sea air is what you crave, then a trip to Felixstowe Beach is certainly what you need. Opposite Mannings Amusements on the seafront are a number of sheltered benches - perfect for you and a family member to meet up on. Wrap up warm, take a flask with you and be sure to grab some fish and chips from one of the chippies dotted along the seafront as you watch the waves crash onto the beach. If you're able to, why not get up early enough to try and catch the sunrise? That first light of the day simply can't be beaten.

“By using this process, results will be available much faster and accuracy will be much greater.
 “It will mean fewer recalls needed due to abnormalities or inadequate smears.”
 Women will now receive letters so they can make an appointment.
 Minister for Health Samantha Sacramento said she was happy to roll out this manifesto commitment.
 “HPV testing is the direction of travel for UK Cervical Cancer Screening programmes,” she said.
 “It is evidence-based and reflects years of HPV vaccination in the community for girls and more recently boys.
 “Cancer Screening programmes are vital for the early detection of cancer and as a result, much more favourable clinical outcomes.”
 Women under 50-years-old who have not had an appointment in the last three years and those over 50 who haven’t been screened in five years can call +350 56004698.
 Recently screened women are being told to sit tight while those turning 25-years-old can now have their first appointment.

Former presidential candidate and South Bend, Indiana mayor Pete buttigieg has been making the case on the streets and on Fox News for why Joe Biden and kamala Harris are the winning ticket America needs, and he joins us live right now. Please welcome back Pete buttigieg. Yay! Mayor Pete, welcome back. Thanks for having me back. Good to see you all. It's election day. How Ya feeling? I feel good. It's -- things are definitely pointing in the right direction. Like everyone else, very cautious about all this. We learned our lesson about never getting comfortable about resulting until they're all the way through. We're used to getting results on election night. There's a lot of reasons why that might not happen this time around. Thatoesn't mean there's anything nefarious going on. It means people are making sure every vote gets counted. I believe if everybody votes and every vote is counted, our side is going to win. Here's something that's got me a little on edge. It's impossible for every vote to be counted by tonight. President trump said that he doesn't think -- it's the first time I called him president trump in four years. He doesn't think that the ballots after election day should be counted. Can he do that? Aren't there laws to -- isn't that what this is about? We're supposed to count every vote. Let's be clear, he doesn't have the authority to do that. He can declare whatever he likes. This is a democratic country and we count the votes. I'm disturbed they have this strategy where they're going to court in some of the STEs trying to some of those votes. We're talking about military voters sending votes in the mail. We're talking about all kinds of legitimate, valid voters. This isn't a strategy you adopt if you think're winning. It's a sign of desperation. They've lost every time they tried to do this in the courts. I'm confident votes will be you see the record turnout. These strategies just aren't working. Mayor Pete, we're still in the depths of the pandemic. Infection numbers are rising, as is the death toll. This president continues to downplay its danger. Many of his supporters unfortunately believe him to his now he's suggesting he may fire Dr. Fauci after the election. If Joe Biden wins, how is he going to handle the fact that at this point there are a lot of people out there who believe the misinformation that's been spread and peddled by this administration about the virus? Yeah, this is a real problem. E Biden is somebody who is going to pay attention to doctors, not attack them. He's going to listen to science, not deny it. We're all frustrated with this virus. We all want our lives back. That's only going to happen when we actually deal with it and confront the pandemic. We have a president who is just wishing it away. The good news is help is on the a Joe Biden administration would take several immediate steps to make testing available and free, and to make treatments available and free and get that vaccine out as soon as it's safe. We need to build up trust in this country so people know the vaccine is going to be safe. We need a president reinforcing what our mayors and county health officials have to say. Mayor Pete, you've been on the road campaigning for Joe Biden. The other day you were confronted by a trump supporter. Are you afraid to hear what I have to say? Are you afraid of what I have to say? Do you denounce white supremacy? Yes. Good, then W agree on something. That's a beginning point. See if you can get your president to do the same thing. You handled that with such grace, but what was going through your mind in that moment? It had to be scary. It's frustrating when somebody thinks instead of going out and cheering for their person they have to get in your way. I also knew the folks that gathered to see me speak were there for a reason. The spirit of what we were doing there was bigger than this guy just trying to disrupt everything. I thought the best thing I could do is point to some shared I doubt he'll vote the way I want him to vote. Eventually we were able to have the event as planned. We have to come to a place where -- of course we're going to disagree sometimes. This idea of constant disruption or even the president seeming to give a wink and nod to political violence, that's not who we are. That's not America. N't care what side you vote for. Most Americans already believe that and agree with that. That's part of what we have to re-establish as soon as we turn the page from the trump years. Mayor Pete, I hope if Biden wins you're in the cabinet. It's taken me a long time to learn how to pronounce buttigieg. I would like to say secretary buttigieg. Anyway, we talked to you on the show about your willingness to book shows where we don't see a lot of Democrats, including fox News. You never deliver from your calm delivery of the facts. Last time I was calm was 2014. Why do you keep going on there? How do you stay so unflappable? So here's the way I think of it, you know, most of the viewers of Fox News don't agree with me politically and definitely the people controlling the content on that network, in my view, aren't always being fair. I also know this, I can't blame somebody for not supporting my perspective if they literally have never heard it. It's my job to get that view in front of viewers who are tuning in in good faith. One of the good things coming out of our troubled political moment, I think a lot of people are questioning old habits, including a lot of Republicans who are saying I voted Republican all my life, but this is not what I had in mind. Now that W thismoment, this president who has offended conservative values as well as Progressive values, really American values, that gives us a moment to build a different I'm so excited about what can happen if we get Republicans alongside independents and fro Progressives -- whether we're talking about the climate or racial justice or something like the pandemic -- the pandemic doesn't care if you're Democrat or Republican. It's a threat to all of us. We have to build some common ground here. To me finding common ground doesn't mean watering down your values. It means taking other people seriously and sharing why you care so much.

The vandalism appeared to be “relatively new,” with “TRUMP” spray-painted on the back of four headstones, and “MAGA” — an acronym for the Trump campaign slogan Make America Great Again — spray-painted on two others, Sgt.
