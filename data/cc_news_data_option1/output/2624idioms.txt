Bergeron said high turnover is a problem at any organization — not just schools. “When there’s a high turnover in leadership, it creates uncertainty, and there’s no loyalty within the staff,” he said, adding that it takes a while for new principals to implement their own policies.
 “When you put a principal in place, really the first year they’re there, the policies are still from the principal that left,” Bergeron said. “Most of those decisions are made during the school year, like for 2020 and 2021, most of those decisions were being made in March, April and May, so by the time the new principal comes in, those pretty much have been made.”
 Bergeron said part of the problem stems from the 2000 passage of the state Teacher Accountability Act, which prevented principals from becoming tenured. He said in some ways this is positive because principals can be removed if their performance is unsatisfactory. However, it contributes to the expectation that a new principal may not remain at a school for long.
 “A lot of superintendents want their own people in those positions, people that they have worked with before, that they trust,” Bergeron said. “So that’s part of the reason principals change around the time the superintendent changes.”
 King said she's confident that the board is "all on the same page," since the board unanimously approved the decisions to transfer Garth and Christopher and to hire Terence Hayden, who will serve as principal of Austin Middle.

FALL RIVER - With a vibrant palette of colors at her fingertips, Gabriela Rois is hoping to spread a little joy with her paintings.
 These days, her lively designs adorn flower pots, birdhouses, fences and just about every available surface in her house that she can get her hands on, she said.
 A native of Brazil, Rois didn't set out to be an artist. Before the desire to start painting hit her, Rois pursued a degree in psychology, met and married and her husband and had a few children. Up until about a couple years ago, her life was more than busy working as a private tutor teaching English to Portuguese and Spanish adult learners. "I always wanted to do something that helps people," she said.
 Then, out of the blue, the muse struck.
 Rois was going though some personal issues and she decided to turn to art to help work out those issues. It started in the classroom in her home that she used to teach students. Rois said she always put up things on the walls to help her students and one day she realized she was putting up more colors than words. "I found a piece of wood in the garage and I started painting and I realized this is fun," she said. "When I was painting I wasn't having any anxiety or any negative thoughts. I thought, maybe this is what I need to keep myself grounded - so in the beginning it was just to survive."
 Then her students who came to her for lessons saw her paintings and they made them as happy as they made her, she said. Before long, she was giving them to her students and in turn, they were paying her for the cost of the painting supplies. "Then I realized I was making a difference making people happy in a different way," she said.
 Then she said she "went crazy," she said, painting the doors and stairs and a fence in her yard. "I knew I had the talent, but I just didn't have the patience. So I think you have to have everything at the right time," she added. "I was turning 40 and something just happened."
 Rois said she painted a door for a woman using the technique she created and then the woman asked her to give her a class to teach her. Now that woman sends her text messages every day saying how happy she is to be painting, she said.
 She was never professionally trained as an artist herself, and now that she's having so much fun painting, she doesn't want to take a class for fear of losing the fun she's experiencing with the technique she uses working with paint markers. "I like the colors, but I'm not following any rules," she added.
 Rois moved on to painting her cheerful designs on birdhouses and flower pots, which are for sale at Gerry's Farm in Brockton. "I made over 200 pots and I don't have any left," she said.
 After visiting someone in a nursing home, Rois said she had the idea of offering to do some kind of painting project for a nursing home or its residents for free, just to bring some joy and color into their lives, but then COVID-19 came along and she had to put that plan aside for awhile. But Rois said she would still like to do something and hopes this article might connect her with a nursing home looking to add a bit of colorful cheer. "I have no doubt that it's saved me. It's kept me grounded just looking the colors in my house and backyard."

Delhi Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal inaugurated the 10,000-bedded Sardar Patel Covid Care Centre and Hospital (SPCCCH) at Radha Soami Satsang Beas on Sunday. The facility is created on an emergent basis by the South Delhi District Administration with full support of the ministry of home affairs in record time of 10 days.
 This the world's largest Covid care facility which will function as an isolation centre for mild and asymptomatic Covid-19 positive patients. At least 10% of the beds have oxygen facility in case the patient develops severe breathlessness and requires tertiary hospital care.
 Operationally, the SPCCCH has been linked to the Deen Dayal Upadhyay Hospital and Madan Mohan Malviya Hospital. The referral tertiary care hospitals are Lok Nayank Jai Prakash Narayan Hospital and Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality Hospital.
 ITBP will be running the first 2,000 beds at present with their 170 doctors/specialists and more than 700 nurses and paramedics.
   
   
 This facility, having large number of beds, to the tune of 10,000 in one single campus, requires speed of management as well as analysis and operations that makes it imperative to explore extensive use of IT. Therefore, the e-Hospital software of NIC is being used to manage all medical operations, right from admission to treatment, investigation, progress, referral and discharge through software. The patients will be admitted from all over Delhi through respective District Surveillance Officers.
 Most of the basic infrastructure such as beds, matresses, linens, etc. has been donated by various civil society organisations and non-governmental organisations. This facility has been created to provide a stress-free and mindful isolation to the patients. A recreational centre has been made available to the patients along with a library, board games, skipping ropes, etc. They will be provided 5 healthy meals a day along with immunity boosting chawanprash, juices, hot kadha etc.

HANOVER -- Johnathan Drosopoulos almost clinched a first-place win as he sped around the race track.
 The 10-year-old Marshfield resident was bested by his grandmother, Celeste Kilday.
 "First is worst," Johnathan said. "Second is the best."
 Kilday and her grandson on Tuesday were visiting the Starland Sportsplex & Fun Park, which opened on June 8, under the second phase of the governor's reopening plan. After go-karts, they hit the miniature golf course.
 "We worked really closely with the Department of Health in Hanover to make sure we were opening the right attractions and were following the right protocols, so everything was ready to go," Marketing Director Kelsey Galante said.
 The amusement park brought back its staff during the first phase of the state's reopening plan to do renovations, including new turf on the miniature golf course and rebuilding and repainting the go-karts.
 The sport facility's expansive indoor courts are also open to youth leagues conducting practices.
 "We can have clinics and some programs running with specific rules and regulations on capacity, no groups larger than 10 in a 20-foot area," Galante said.
 The space is so expansive it will be hosting Hanover's annual town meeting with a socially-distanced capacity of 1,400, across multiple areas, although they will be setting up 700 seats initially.
 In addition to the go-karts and miniature golf, the park has also opened its "eurobungy," a type of tethered trampoline attraction, its batting cages, all outside. Inside, it has opened its bumper cars, Galante said.
 The outdoor rock wall remains closed, following concerns expressed by the Hanover Board of Health. Also still closed are the indoor laser tag arena, the interactive theater and the arcade, she said.
 Although the park may be open, business has been slow, Operations Director Scott McEwen said.
 "It increases a little bit each day," he said.
 Under Phase 2, the outdoor capacity of the park is 100 people, which increase to almost full capacity under Phase 3, which could begin as early as July 6.
 One of the more popular attractions is miniature golf, which lends itself to social distancing. Used putters are placed in a vat of sanitizing liquid and groups are supposed to wait for each other on each hole.
 Jillian Robinson, 20, of Scituate, came with four friends to play miniature golf on Tuesday, just about the only thing they have been able to do since the pandemic began, aside from going to the beach or for drives.
 "It's nice to be able to go out," she said.
 Joel Dwyer, 19, of Brockton, said although it may not be as much exercise as a full round of golf, it was something, especially considering he has gained a few pounds since the pandemic started.
 Robinson said once she found out the park was open, she told her friends they were all going.
 Madison Adams, 20, of Hanson, said she liked the round of miniature golf. It was a good change of pace from hitting the beach.
 Game on at Starland and his grandmother, behind the group of young adults, said after the go-karts and the mini golf, they were going to the beach to cool off.
 "After golf, we're done with our mission for the day," Kilday said. "It'll be time for a nip in the ocean."

In 2019, at the request of local school leaders, state Sen. Arthur Orr, R-Decatur, sponsored a successful bill to send most of the SSUT funds for Morgan County to the county’s school systems. Orr has said the bill was modeled after how local sales tax dollars are distributed.
 “It’s clear that the SSUT increases are coming at the expense of bricks-and- mortar taxes that go toward education,” Orr said. “At the end of the day, the internet sales taxes are coming at the expense of school children.”
 Hartselle City Schools' chief financial officer Bradley Colburn said the local law helps account for the fact that more people are doing their shopping online.
 "Really, all we're asking is that there not be a difference between whether an item was sold in a store or sold online," Colburn said. "All we're asking for is this money to be distributed as if it was bought in the store."
 But Morgan County leaders refused to comply with the local law, saying it was unconstitutional. The Alabama Education Association sued on behalf of its members and local school systems joined the lawsuit. The County Commission’s legal position focused on Section 105 of the Alabama Constitution, which generally prohibits a local law from contradicting a statewide law. Earlier this year, a Montgomery County Circuit Court judge ruled that the local law was constitutional. The County Commission has appealed and that case is pending.

Walking around downtown Athens, Jamie Adams stood in front of the rust red cinder-block wall across the street from the Alabama Veterans Museum and Archives and imagined the story it could tell.
 This summer, Adams, armed with gallons of paint and assisted by five students, will spend 700 hours transforming the empty wall into a mural honoring local veterans. Through portraits, the mural will tell the story of hundreds of Limestone County active duty military members and veterans, including Adams’ grandfather and great-uncle, who served in World War II, and his two uncles, who died in the Vietnam War.
 “This is a way to honor those individuals who we need to remember, honor and celebrate,” said Adams, an assistant art professor at Athens State. “A lot of people don’t get the recognition they deserve, especially men like my two uncles who passed away. Having a way to honor their memory, having their portrait where thousands of people see it as they drive by, keeps their memories and sacrifices alive.”
 Once complete, the 40-foot-long by 15-foot-tall mural will feature three soldiers in front of an American flag consisting of a mosaic of 200 photographs of Limestone County servicemen and women.
 “Honoring our veterans is our main objective in the museum and, with this mural, we can do this,” said Sandy Thompson, director of the museum. “It will be the first thing they see when they pull in and the final thing they see as they leave the museum and will leave a lasting impression on them. It will be a great identifier for the museum.”
 The museum hopes to move into its new space, next door at the former Limestone County Event Center, by the end of the year, but it will still be across the street from the mural.
 Adams, who created several sketches in a range of color palates for the mural, worked closely with the museum’s board to finalize the design. The board selected a generic design that does not depict a specific soldier or battlefield.
 Along with remembering local veterans, the mural will double as a fundraiser for the museum, which, due the coronavirus, had to cancel fundraising events. For a donation of $100, the artists will include the portrait of a Limestone County veteran in the mural. With 200 spaces available, the project could raise $20,000.
 “Donations are down because we do not have the visitor population that we normally do at this time of year,” Thompson said. “It is also hard to fundraise right now because we know so many businesses are suffering. This will help with the daily operation funds that we are missing out on through donations.”
 For Adams, who grew up in Limestone County, and returned to north Alabama last year, the project serves as a way to positively impact his community.
 “Having art outdoors opens up a lot of venues for education. Some kids who cannot afford to go to museums can see art outside in the city. It brings attention to the arts and art programs and allows students to see that you can have a future and make a living doing art,” Adams said.
 For Adams, the mural carries on an art form he practiced while teaching at Judson College and West Texas A&M University. He created 12 portraits of instrumental people from Perry County, the home of Judson College, which were featured in the windows of a building in downtown Marion. In Texas, Adams helped oversee a “mural squad” with students who completed art projects around the university.
 Within weeks of moving back to Alabama, Adams reached out to Tere Richardson, director of Athens Main Street, about creating a mural. Once Adams secured the building and finalized the design, Athens State encouraged him to develop a class around the mural.
 Five students from Cullman, Auburn and Huntsville signed up for the class and have been working on the mural every Friday since June 5. They pressure-washed the wall and primed the surface with two coats of gesso, which, due to the consistency, the group painted on the cinder blocks with brushes. After gridding off the wall into six-inch by six-inch squares, the artists transferred the mural’s design onto the wall.
 “We basically made a gigantic paint by numbers,” Adams said. “This is a technique artists have used since before the Renaissance. It is easier to transfer the images onto the wall that way.”
 For the portraits of the veterans, the artists will section off each of the boxes into one-inch by one-inch squares. Each of the estimated 200 portraits will take an hour to complete. One of the portraits will honor U.S. Marine Staff Sgt. Joshua Dempsey.
 “This is another way to honor him. We are very proud of his service and continuing on our family’s legacy. My father and step-father served in World War II and my brother was in the service also,” said Yvonne Dempsey.
 Adams hopes this mural begins a movement to bring more outdoor art to Athens and north Alabama. Adams expects to complete the mural in August, weather permitting.
 To include a veteran's portrait in the mural, contact Thompson at info@alabamaveteransmuseum.com.
 Standing in front of the wall where the students painted in black sections, Adams watched the mural take shape.
 “I’m very proud of what we are doing here. I’m very proud we are creating a piece of art to honor our veterans in a public space,” Adams said.

Ed and Renee Douglass didn’t allow the COVID-19 pandemic to grind their Fourth of July celebration to a complete halt Saturday.
 The Decatur couple, residents at Point Mallard Campground for the past four years, were busy organizing an impromptu, early evening golf cart parade, replacing the annual campground parade sponsored by the Parks and Recreation Department that was canceled because of the pandemic.
 The Douglass family and many others across north Alabama said their Saturday cookouts were smaller because of the coronavirus. The cancellation of the Spirit of America event, fireworks display and the season-long closure of the aquatic center tempered the fun at the usually bustling Point Mallard Park in Decatur.
 “There’s certainly not as many people at the campground this year,” said Ed Douglass, 71. “The campground is full, but most people are just staying home because of no festival or fireworks, and the water park is closed. We’ll have our golf cart parade, but we’ll keep social distancing and there will be no prizes. There is almost nobody out on their carts or walking this year.”
 Elaine Suggs, 59, who finished on the second-place team in last year’s parade, was saddened they couldn’t try to win the top prize this year. “We just hope this is not our new normal now,” she said.
 Ed Douglass said they are limiting their cookout to their family and a couple of neighbors. “We’re doing our best to stay safe,” he said.
 Renee Douglass said they were cooking ribs and pork chops. “Bacon has been tough to find in the stores,” she said. “We really miss the fellowship out here.”
 Donald Jones of Clanton and his sister-in-law Ladean Jones of Neel were busy cooking gumbo, crawfish chowder and hot dogs while watching their grandchildren enjoy the campground.
 “Normally we’d be at the water park, but we’re content sitting in the shade now,” Ladean Jones said.
 “Smaller groups are the norm now,” Donald Jones added.
 Carris Woods, 55, of Arab, was at the campground grilling bratwursts, hamburgers and hotdogs with some family members and coworkers.
 “We’ll be enjoying lawn darts and doing a lot of grilling,” he said. “Not much else to do with everything closed.”
 Stephanie McLain, Point Mallard Park superintendent, said it seems surreal with the water park not being open this summer, especially on the Fourth of July weekend. “Typically on July 4 we have between 4,000 and 5,000 guests,” she said. “It really depends on the weather.”
 The past three years, the Point Mallard Aquatic Center has seen more than 480,000 visitors pass through its gates. In 2018, 170,333 visited the park, McLain said. Last year, the number dipped to 151,258 partly because of record rainfall, she said. The National Weather Service in Huntsville said 5.19 inches of rain was recorded at the Huntsville International Airport in July 2019 compared to 2.42 inches in July 2018. This year would have marked the aquatic center’s 50th year.
 Jackie Letson, of the Mount Moriah community in Lawrence County, said he would have a fireworks show on his rural homestead but only family members would be at a smaller cookout this year.
 “We’re not having friends over this year,” said Letson, 51. “I’m not going to take a chance. The Lord is taking care of us, so we really don’t have to fear. But (the virus) is a serious thing. We’re cooking half a hog, hamburgers and hot dogs for about 15 of us. Sometimes, we’ve had about 100 people at our Fourth of July cookout, but just family this year.”
 Josefina Silva, 54, of Cullman, said she planned for only five or six at the cookout. “I usually have 10 or more, but this COVID-19 thing is hurting everything. We’re just trying to stay safe.” She was selling corn, cantaloupe and cucumbers at the Decatur-Morgan County Farmers Market on Saturday morning. Silva and other vendors said business has been down all season but good on Friday and Saturday.
 Exon Williams, 57, of Hillsboro, said COVID-19 has limited his Fourth of July cookout to immediate family members. “In the past, we’ve had about 30 people or so at the cookout,” he said. “But this year, everybody is staying close to home, staying to themselves to be safe because of COVID.”
 Hartselle’s Bobby Brown said he refuses to allow COVID-19 to change his lifestyle.
 “I don’t let the government dictate what I do,” he said. “I’m cooking out and will be boating all weekend. There’s way too much government intervention in our world.”

Demonstrators left that area, on the banks of the Ohio River, and walked down Washington Avenue to the historic Customs House. During the civil rights era, the building served as Cairo's police station and jail. Robert Hunt's death there in 1967 touched off three days of tense protests and riots, and reignited the battle for civil rights in Cairo. Police said Hunt, a Black solider home on leave, committed suicide. But it was -- and is -- widely believed in the Black community that he was lynched, as well, murdered by law enforcement or with their consent.

“You would hope that the local municipalities and the local county commissioners would acknowledge this for what it is and do the right thing and either give that portion to the school districts as they do in a brick-and- mortar store (sales tax) or share that with the school districts,” Hollingsworth said. He said in some counties, those conversations are happening.
 Long said that if the original law is going to be changed, it should be done statewide and not county by county.
 Meanwhile, both Long and Brasfield said if education groups are worried about SSUT’s impact on education, they should look at where larger portions of the revenue are now going, including municipalities and the state General Fund.
 In fiscal 2019, the SSUT was worth $69.9 million for the General Fund and about $23.3 million for the Education Trust Fund.

Un minimo comunque denominatore fedele alla Ditta (a differenza dell'unica anomalia renziana), ma senza smalto che non scontenta nessuno e non entusiasma nessuno. Un Zingaretti sorridente insomma.

The Braves said "they have a lot of work to do on and off the field."
 The team said in recent months that "it has created an even stronger bond with various Native American tribes, both regionally and nationally, on issues related to the Braves and the culture of Native Americans."

 "We have also held meetings with our Native American Task Force that will collaborate with us on cultural issues, education, and community outreach to amplify their voices and show our fans that they are still proud here," the statement said.
 "The Atlanta Braves have a significant commitment to honor the Native American community and we are excited to work together to ensure this happens," he said.
 The Braves have not said whether they will encourage tomahawk chop and fan singing this season. The singing caused a stir in the National League Division Series loss last year against the St. Louis Cardinals.
 Cardinals pitcher Ryan Helsley, a member of the Cherokee Nation, said he found the chant insulting. Following Helsley's criticism of the chant, the Braves did not distribute their traditional red foam axes to fans before Game 5 of the series, won by the Cardinals.
 Foam cutouts are used when Braves fans sing along in games.
 Before Game 5, the Braves said they did not distribute the foam cutouts "out of respect for the concerns" expressed by Helsley. The Braves said they would continue to examine the issue after the season.
 There will be no fans in the stands when the Braves' 2020 season, delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic, is slated to begin on July 23 or 24. The Braves made no reference to the cut in their statement Saturday.

These are exciting times to be a Pakistan cricket fan. Well, the national team remains an enigma as they continue to blow hot and cold, but after a long time Pakistan can look forward to a strong future.
 One of the reasons for that is the talent pool available to the team. Yes, they were disappointing as they failed to make it to the semi-final of the ICC World Cup but they fought valiantly after a timid start to the tournament. They are the reigning champion of the Champions Trophy and have been at the top of the T20I rankings for a while before sliding last year.
 For a team that has had to play home matches away from home, their form in Test cricket has not been too bad.
 As far as the future is concerned, Pakistani fans are currently expecting a lot from their premier batsman Babar Azam. The youngster's growth in international cricket has been meteoric to say the least and pundits are praising him for his ability to play in all conditions and across all formats.
   
   
 He is currently the only batsman in the world to feature in the Top-5 of ICC rankings across all three formats. His rise has led to him being named the captain of the team in the limited-overs format.
 Azam though isn't very old in the system and his rise can be credited to the Pakistani team management. Azam though has special words for his former coach Micky Arthur whom he credits for backing him.
 "Mickey really supported me. He gave me confidence. He rated me highly even when I was very much a newcomer. He backed me all the time. The best thing about him was he had great trust in my abilities," Azam was quoted as saying by the ICC.
 Pakistan is currently being coached by former captain Misbah-ul-Haq and Azam said Misbah too has been backing him
 "I must add that Misbah bhai is no different. He really backs me and has confidence in me. It really helps when your coach trusts you," he added.

The Decatur City Council will consider an ordinance Monday requiring people to wear a face covering in public in order to help stem the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19.
 The move comes as coronavirus cases in the state and locally are surging, and as other Alabama cities adopt their own mask ordinances.
 The Mobile City Council voted 6-1 Wednesday to approve an ordinance requiring facial coverings in public places for the next 30 days. The Tuscaloosa City Council unanimously approved its ordinance Tuesday. The Tuscaloosa ordinance carries a $25 fine for violations. The Mobile ordinance has a $50 fine.
 One proposal being considered by the Decatur City Council is much tougher, carrying a fine of up to $500 and up to 30 days in jail for failing to wear a mask in public during the pandemic.
 The potential of jail time for violations, however, seems self-defeating, given that public health officials have warned all along that jails and prisons could become coronavirus hot spots, and indeed Alabama’s prisons have. The Alabama Department of Corrections reported last week that a seventh inmate had died after testing positive for COVID-19.
 If Decatur adopts a mask ordinance, it should follow the lead of Tuscaloosa and Mobile and make it enforceable with a token fine, not jail time. The point of the ordinance shouldn’t be to punish, but to nudge in the right direction those people who are not looking out for their fellow residents.
 Better still, give police officers an alternative to issuing citations. Mobile Mayor Sandy Stimpson said police officers there have been given masks to distribute if someone needs one. That should be the first option.
 “We would much rather have our officers handing out face masks instead of citations,” Stimpson said.
 In any event, we question how diligently the city of Decatur would enforce any mask ordinance it chooses to adopt.
 Gov. Kay Ivey has thus far declined to enact a statewide mask law, saying it couldn’t be enforced. And when it comes to enforcing city codes, Decatur doesn’t have a good track record.
 Is there any reason Decatur would enforce a mask ordinance more diligently than it does ordinances prohibiting basketball goals on streets, boats and broken down campers in yards, and trash in recycling bins?
 Yet the fact cities throughout the historically contrarian South are now willing to consider requiring masks in public simply underlines how bad the coronavirus pandemic has become, with new cases and deaths now exceeding the previous highs of April and May.
 Even Texas is doing an about face as COVID-19 insists on messing with it. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott last week ordered the wearing of masks across most of the state after refusing until recently even to let local governments impose such rules, The Associated Press reported.
 “Abbott, who in May began one of the most aggressive reopening schedules of any governor, ordered the wearing of masks in all counties with at least 20 COVID-19 cases,” The AP reported.
 About 25 people were outside of Decatur City Hall on Tuesday protesting the possible mask mandate. If the council passes one, it won’t go over well, and many local business owners have made clear that they don’t want to be put in charge of enforcing the ordinance.
 Hand out masks. Make them readily available. Citations and fines should be the last resort, but they may be necessary if persuasion fails.
