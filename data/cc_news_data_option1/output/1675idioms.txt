After the French government’s ruling, the French football governing bodies formally confirmed that no football will be happening, even behind closed doors, until September. With the death rate still so high and so many families having loved ones robbed from them, this feels the right move both emotionally and scientifically.
 Should players, supporters and staff be rushed back at a time when doing so may put their own lives and safety at risk? And that’s before we even consider their inevitably close relationships with family and others who may be vulnerable. It’s hard to think so.
 All too often football, particularly those who run it in plush offices up and down the country; are accused of forgetting the bigger picture and fundamentally only caring about pounds and pence. Sometimes those attacks are unfair, but sometimes they’re not. And if football isn’t calm, takes a few deep breaths, and gives itself the time and breathing space to not rush things and make the right decision; then it will only have itself to blame for further criticism.

Attention will turn to the Federal Reserve today, who will be announcing their latest monetary policy decision. In terms of what to expect, our US economists’ view (link here) is that this meeting will primarily provide a status update on the Fed’s actions so far, as well as the FOMC’s evolving views on the economic outlook. On forward guidance, they similarly think there’ll be little change with the FOMC continuing their commitment to keep the federal funds rate where it is “until it is confident that the economy has weathered recent events” and begun to recover. And though it’s a close call, they don’t think there’ll be an IOER hike either, as the FOMC won’t want to unintentionally send a hawkish signal about monetary policy, even if this is a technical adjustment.

A top Russian security official was present in eastern Ukraine coordinating military operations with the rebel separatists accused of shooting down Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17, killing 298 people in 2014, according to journalists and open source investigators.
 Dutch intelligence -- using hundreds of intercepted phone calls -- previously determined that an unidentified Russian official using the alias "Vladimir Ivanovich" was a go-between in the relationship between Ukrainian seperatist rebels in the eastern portion of the country and Russian military support efforts that were poured into the breakaway region of Donbass.
 But on Tuesday, multiple news outlets including Bellingcat, a Russian publication called The Insider, and BBC Russia identified "Ivanovich" as Col- General Andrey Ivanovich Burlaka, a top-ranking official in Russia's internal security service, the FSB, and a man believed to be the No.4 official in Russia's domestic security chain of command.
 Burlaka, 54, as first deputy for the border service of the FSB, was allegedly sent to Ukraine just days before a BUK anti-aircraft missile system from Russia's 53rd anti-aircraft brigade targeted the commercial jet, killing everyone on board.

Verso le 18 una ragazza, poco prima gia identificata nell'ambito dei controlli per l'emergenza Covid, e entrata nel market insieme a due uomini, probabilmente stranieri, ed ha tentato di rubare una bottiglia di vino insieme a uno dei due amici. Il direttore si e accorto del furto e ha tentato di bloccare la fuga del terzetto ma per tutta risposta e stato travolto e spinto a terra, ferendosi leggermente a un braccio. I tre sono fuggiti e l'uomo ha chiamato il 112. Sul posto sono intervenute le volanti della polizia, che hanno ascoltato i testimoni, e l'ambulanza. Il direttore non e voluto ricorrere alle cure del pronto soccorso, venendo medicato sul posto.

Meanwhile, oil had a volatile session, with WTI fluctuating between gains and losses before closing another -3.44% lower at $12.34/barrel. This was on the back of news that USO, the largest WTI crude ETF, rolled completely out of the June contracts earlier than anticipated. However, as our colleague Michael Hsueh noted, a lot of commodity index funds have long had more 'intelligent' roll strategies, which wouldn't have been invested in front month futures. Regardless, given that inventory increases are still running at extreme rates we may still be seeing such violent moves in WTI futures without the fund rolls. The EIA inventory report later today will be very important, as is the global floating storage data. The last week of floating storage data ending 24 Apr shows the biggest 2-week build on record (since data starts in 2010), well exceeding anything in 2015-16. Outside of WTI, Brent crude ended the session almost unchanged however, at +2.35%. The effect of declining crude prices was also seen on Saudi Arabia’s central bank’s net foreign assets as they dropped by c. SAR -100bn (-$27bn) in March, the fastest pace since at least 2000, to $464bn, the lowest since 2011. Last week, Saudi Finance Minister Mohammed Al- Jadaan said the Kingdom would only draw down reserves by up to SAR 120bn over the whole year. So interesting that c. SAR 100bn was drawn in March itself.

More than 56,000 people have died from COVID-19 in the US. On Monday, global coronavirus cases passed 3 million, meaning one in three patients is in the US. The US government has failed its people and also failed the world.      The US is home to more than 300 million people. If the same proportion of infections were to have occurred in China, a country with over 1.4 billion people, 4 million people would have been infected, about 50 times more than the actually number of reported cases. If that had happened, it would mean the epidemic situation in all Chinese provinces was worse than in Hubei. China's overall level of medical treatment is lower than that of the US. It is possible that China could have fallen into such a humanitarian disaster.      Chinese people won't allow their country to suffer vast infections like the US. The US hasn't been in chaos, not because Americans have willingly accepted their sufferings from COVID-19 but because they are in too much despair to fight.      Americans are desperately seeing the epidemic spread nationwide, as politicians duck responsibility and blame each other with some intending to reopen business even as the crisis escalates.      US way of social organizations have shown an inability to contain the coronavirus, while politicians are busy focusing on elections, and US society is in a mess and incapable of mobilizing a nationwide battle against COVID-19. Ordinary Americans can only take care of themselves.      The US government is supposed to do the following things. First, it needs to apologize to its people and admit it has mishandled the epidemic. Second, it must learn lessons and take decisive measures to fight against the virus and reduce infections and deaths. Third, it should push forward international cooperation and create conditions for a global fight to eliminate the novel coronavirus.      However, the US government has done none of those things. The US Democrats have not served as a supportive force to unite US society at this critical moment, and instead have eyed on the elections and placed their political interests above the life-threatening epidemic. This has caused the American people great grief.      US-styled democratic politics has become polarized. It hasn't borne its due responsibilities at this critical and historic moment, nor has it fostered unity of US society. The US is fighting a chaotic battle against the virus, with huge losses and few gains. The number of infections has reached 1 million, but the US prevention and control work remains in a mess.      There is still great uncertainty with its future work. Passing the buck to China is a very vulgar trick. It can only help the federal government and the Republican Party to divert public attention and gain some election benefits. It is of no help to the US anti-epidemic situation, nor will it lead US society to reflect on the failures. Such a situation is precisely a manifestation of political weakness of the US.      The number of infections and deaths will continue to rise. Americans, especially the poor, are still facing severe threats from COVID-19. The rich can shelter at home and receive better treatment even if they are infected. But it's a different case with the poor, whose infection and death rates are much higher.  A super power shouldn't lead the virus fight in this way. It's time for the US to wake up.

Atchison, a speedster at the forward position, helped lead a loaded Lewis County team that finished just one game away from the state tournament in 2018 and earned a runner up spot in the section in 2019.
 Atchison’s play in his senior season netted him a spot on the Class AA All- State second team, as well as a first-team All-Region nod.
 Atchison said he chose WVWC due to the facilities and the coaching staff. He added that he’s preparing for the move to college by following a training program and doing a lot of conditioning work, even during the current lockdown.
 But even with that display of work ethic, he’s quick to give some of the credit to his coaches and teammates.
 “I have to thank my coaches, Ryan Casto and Jordan Stafford, and my family for supporting me every step of the way. I also have to thank my teammates. I had the chance to play with a great group of guys, and I’m excited to get the chance to play at WVWC,” Atchison said.

There has been much debate about highly paid footballers rejecting pay cuts and whether they are justified in taking such a stance under the current circumstances.
 Obviously, Mesut Ozil stands out for Arsenal but it is not just him, it is about all the other players that are keeping their hands firmly in their pockets, for example, Chelsea players and where are the Tottenham players or Man Utd, Man City, Liverpool etc in all this?
 It is also nothing to do with the NHS, it never was and to suggest it was, with respect is misinformation. Every club statement, including Arsenal’s, has made that clear, it was always about keeping clubs afloat and helping the clubs lower paid.
 There is no respect from me for those players, to me, it is indefensible.
 I watched a recent Sunday Supplement episode and it had three well-known journalists on there, Henry Winter, John Cross and Martin Samuel and all three had some good things to say, though John Cross, who incidentally defended Mesut Ozil passionately, is widely regarded by Arsenal fans as full of bull, certainly on here judging by the comments.
 Samuel expressed his disappointment that the players refused pay cuts, he admitted he never saw it coming and thought that they would be more than happy to help the clubs out. He also added that the NHS has never ever had so much money being thrown at it and simply does not need cash from the players, it is the clubs that need the help.
 But it was the comments from the highly respected Henry Winter, a winner of many international journalism awards, that I found the most compelling.
 He basically asked how the players could look the lowly paid club workers and their fans, who are suffering unimaginably right now, in the eyes when they simply refused to stand shoulder to shoulder with them at this time.
 Winter also pointed out that it is also about unity and that players should stand together as a whole, obviously not at Arsenal with three players preferring to keep their money and not give a fig about squad unity.
 The players have disgracefully tried to use the NHS as some sort of excuse to avoid helping their own club out, and it is very sad that some Arsenal fans find it necessary to defend this indefensible position.
 The pay cut was always about the club and never about the NHS and it is wrong in my opinion to try and conflate the issues, though I have no doubts that if it was Shkodran Mustafi or Granit Xhaka that had refused to take a pay cut that this would never ever be an issue and they would be rightfully condemned by Arsenal fans.

“I’ve got to say, I watched him in a lot of the games in the run-in last year – I know he had a bit of a tough time – but I was really struck by his bravery on the ball. He always wanted it,” he told Soccer AM back in November.
 “I was excited to work with him, and from day one in pre-season, we had a possession game, it was clear his ability on the ball.
 “What’s become even clearer since then, his attitude and what he does with the group, he’s driven. That’s why I’ve made him vice-captain. He’s one of those infectious players, he cajoles players on the pitch, before the game. I’ve loved to see the fans’ reaction to him.
 “One thing a fan will always do – and I’m a fan – is that when you see someone giving everything, passion, drive, they will always react to that. You’ve seen that with Jorginho.”

The true toll is believed to be much higher because of limited testing, differences in counting the dead and deliberate under-counting by some governments.

Looking back on my 10 years of writing this column has made me realize a few things. First off, that I’ve come a long way in my growth as an individual, a mother and a partner. The second thing is that I still have a long way to go.
 For me, this column has been incredibly therapeutic. It has provided a platform to share experiences that have pushed me beyond my comfort zone. It has been an outlet for my fears and concerns.
 My goal when I first started to write this column a decade ago, was to not just push myself to reach beyond my comfort zone, but to also encourage others to do so as well. Whether it was wake surfing for the first time, or flying in a stunt plane over Lake Minnetonka, there were many experiences I would not have tried, had I not had a deadline to meet for my column.
 Over the last decade, I’ve shared about my experience leaving the cult I grew up in, as well has the harassment that followed for a few years. I shared about realizing I was an alcoholic who needed to stop drinking. I haven’t had a drink in 34 months.
 Nothing has been off limits, much to the dismay of some of my family members. I’ve been open about my health issues over the last two years as well. Throughout the last decade of over-sharing, I’ve realized one big thing.
 To do or accomplish anything, you have to set a deadline. Many of the activities I’ve written about were on my bucket list of experiences I hoped to have. Because I had a writing deadline, I had to be doing something to write about it.
 After 10 years of pushing myself beyond my comfort zone, I don't plan to stop because I'll no longer be writing this column. I'll be using my blog www.AdventuresInLivingAloha.com as a platform for my adventures and musings. I hope that you follow me over there.
 I’m incredibly thankful for the support I’ve gotten from our community in many ways. If you have been reading my column for a short while or the whole last 10 years, I thank you for listening to what I have to say.
 There have been many letters and emails over the years that I’ve received. Most of them were positive notes, a numbered few were negative, which is to be expected. I value the feedback I’ve received from readers, whether I agreed with it or not. It is only when we view a different point of view that we can grow.
 I’ve come to realize my goal to push myself beyond my comfort zone and encourage others to do the same, has no end. It’s something that is ongoing. In writing this column, I always had that writing deadline, which often propelled me into action.
 There is no doubt in my mind, that had I not written this column for the last decade, I would not be the person I am today. I’m grateful for the opportunity and I’m thankful for each person who took the time to read what I had to say.
 Wishing you all the best as we all move forward. Please stay in touch. You can find me on social media and through my blog.

Furthermore, I was having trouble in my marriage. I have serious trust issues, and as much as I could attempt to explain this away, I knew I needed answers. It wasn’t until I was in my late 20s that I had an official diagnosis of all my crazy behaviors. My therapist said, “You fit and fill the criteria for PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder).”
 To be honest, I had no real concept of what PTSD is or where it came from until it was explained. PTSD in the easiest terms can be defined as a “reaction to fear, feeling of loss of control, and vulnerability that one experiences following an unexpected and shocking event.”
 I don’t want to give the mental health definition, because PTSD is so complex. Sadly, even to this day I hear, “You never served in a war. You can’t have PTSD.” Some common signs of PTSD are intrusive re-experiencing thoughts or memories about the event, avoidance of events, places or people that are reminders, constant changes in mood, and increased arousal and reactivity. Again, this isn’t an all exclusive list and each person is different.
 Now look back to my paragraph about my behaviors. I match 90% of those signs. Other common mental health disorders that go along with sexual violence are depression, anxiety and poly-substance abuse. Not only do I have PTSD, but I have all the above. Yes, I have been sober for many years, but if I allowed the addiction could come back easily.
 I wanted to share this with you all to know that sexual violence is traumatizing. Some cases not as much and some cases significantly. Some experience this right away and some experience it years down the road. We are functions in our new normal and my new normal includes helping victims and survivors thrive in their new normal.

Arsenal are being linked with an interest in signing Wissam Ben Yedder from Monaco this summer, but who is he?
 The 30 year-old was born and bred in France, and grew up alongside childhood friend Riyad Mahrez.
 Around his 20th birthday, he was snapped up by Ligue 1 outfit Toulouse, who had been scouting his fourth-tier side UJA Alfortville, but the hard-work was not yet done.
 Ben Yedder spent his first three seasons with his new side predominantly on the bench, picking up 13 substitute appearances, scoring only once.
 Everything changed in the next season as he was promoted into a first-team role, and he returned the favour with an impressive 15 goals in his breakthrough campaign. Since that year he has scored at least 10 league goals every single year apart from one, in which he was limited to only 18 starts for Seville, where he still managed to find the net nine times.
 Ben Yedder returned to France last summer, and had amassed 18 goals in his debut term for Monaco before the season was cancelled yesterday, although it remains to be seen whether he will be given a golden boot for his troubles with the full campaign not being played out.
 Ligue 1’s early finish is expected to have major financial implications for a number of clubs, which may well drive down transfer values, and Arsenal for one may well be in need of a new striker this summer, with both Alexandre Lacazette and Aubameyang both linked with moves.
 Below is his goals and best bits of 2019-20.
 Would WBY be a decent replacement should we have to offload one of our current options? Will the French situation see valuations plummet?

 “Our biggest realization is that virtual meetings require more staff time, particularly from our supporters in the Information Technology Department, who are facilitating the meetings, and training other staff, committee chairs, and committee members in advance,” she said. “Thus far, at least with Plan Commission, we’re seeing similar levels of participation as we did during in- person meetings.”

The virus is first detected in Indonesia at an internment camp, where the prisoners have been persecuted because they are gay, and many have compromised immune systems due to HIV/AIDS. It then spreads to Saudi Arabia, and rampages across the world, overwhelming health care systems, upending life and sending the global economy into a tailspin.

SCANDI/EM - The Swedish and Norwegian Krona have both lost a bit of traction, though remain in bullish mode despite Riksbank rhetoric reiterating that ZIRP is not the lower bound and NIER slashing its 2020 GDP estimate to -7% from -3.2% previously, while the latest Norges Bank survey portrays a bleaker picture for Q2 vs Q1 with most respondents reporting weaker activity, and for some a dramatic decline. Conversely, EM currencies are broadly bid on the back of the flagging Buck and Rub due to the aforementioned calmer waters in oil as Russia’s Energy Minister Novak confirms full compliance with the OPEC+ production pact. However, the Try is still underperforming near the 7.0000 handle that is being staunchly defended by the CBRT after a slump in Turkish economic sentiment.

 “The World Economic Forum is warning that the shock to the global economy is faster and more severe than the 2008 global financial crisis and even the Great Depression of 1929-32.
 “In those two previous episodes stock markets collapsed by up to 50 per cent, credit markets froze up, massive bankruptcies followed, unemployment rates soared above 10 per cent.
 “But all this took about three years to play out.
 “In the current crisis, similarly dire macro-economic and financial outcomes have materialised in three weeks.

"It is such a big deal for us in this country and we want it to be played when everything is right and there are no problems around the world."
 The 100-ball competition, involving eight city-based teams in separate men's and women's tournaments, was due to begin on 17 July and end on 15 August.
 At a meeting last week, the ECB opted to extend the shutdown on professional cricket in England and Wales until at least 1 July.
 If and when the 2020 season gets under way, the governing body will look to schedule men's and women's internationals, as well as domestic first-class and limited-overs cricket, in the period from July to the end of September.
 The Hundred was devised to attract a new audience to the game, utilising the wave of interest that followed England's World Cup win of 2019.
 However, it is looking increasingly likely the majority of any professional cricket played this summer would have to be behind closed doors.
 Last week, ECB chief executive Tom Harrison told the BBC: "The Hundred was envisaged as being a tournament that enabled us to widen the audience for the game. With an in-stadia environment, with international players, it's going to be very, very difficult."
 More than 180,000 tickets have already been bought for matches, some of which were due to be televised live on the BBC.
 "The mood and wave cricket was on in England last year made it an amazing opportunity this year to play The Hundred, but obviously with what has happened around the world, that is going to be harder now," added Moeen, who is due to captain Birmingham Phoenix.
 "If we can get other international players who were not available this year, it can make The Hundred even stronger for next year and we can attract a new audience to come and watch cricket."
 The 18 first-class counties were each set to receive £1.3m from The Hundred, money which the ECB confirmed in March had already begun to be distributed.
 And while Harrison admitted the game in England and Wales is facing a "very significant financial problem", he reiterated the ECB's commitment to The Hundred and the costs that will come with launching it at a later date.
 "The reason why the Hundred was put in place was as a way of growing the game in this country and Covid-19 simply exacerbates the requirement for us to grow the game in this country," he said last week.
 "The Hundred is going to generate revenue, interest and excitement and that is the kind of thing we need to continue to prioritise as we go through this enormous challenge
 "I see the case for The Hundred being much greater than it was, if that is indeed even in question."
 Speaking on BBC Radio 5 Live, England fast bowler Stuart Broad said The Hundred will be "vital to the health of English cricket over the next few years", adding it is imperative the T20 Blast - involving the 18 first-class counties - is prioritised this summer.
 "I don't think the sport will take any risks, I think we'll only get playing live cricket when it's been safe to do by the government," Broad added.

Today I will be building off the topic of “my story” to help give real-life perspectives. Please know this is my perspective only, and others experience trauma in different ways. To start off we should provide you with the definition of trauma, which is “an emotional response to a terrible event like an accident, rape, natural disaster immediately after the event, shock and denial are typical. Longer term reactions include unpredictable emotions, flashbacks, strained relationships, and even physical symptoms like headaches and nausea.”
 This list of trauma-like experiences and symptoms is not an all exclusive list, but more of the commonly seen and reported. Victims and survivors of sexual violence may not always identify what happened to them as traumatic, but days to years down the road some longer term effects may be notable.
 In my earlier adult years, I looked back at my teenage years and thought to myself I was just a typical teenager acting out. Some acting out was typical, but the extent of my acting out was not. At first, I didn’t identify as a victim or that something traumatic had happened to me. I really began to use drugs heavily in my early teens, along with alcohol to the point it was daily if not hourly. Now looking back I was masking the trauma by using those substances.
 By masking my trauma, it only allowed me to endure that trauma for years to come. I found myself being very promiscuous, breaking significant house rules, and my parents not wanting to punish me harshly because they were afraid I would run away. I kept to myself a lot, not talking to anyone. But some days I was very social. I was always very hypervigilant when out in public, looking around me. I wouldn’t allow people to walk behind me so I would step to the side and let them pass. I left my high school and went to another school where I got kicked out for fighting. I ended up in an awesome alternative school and back to my regular high school to finish my senior year. Yes, my parents attempted to get me help shortly after I had reported, but I wasn’t ready, nor do I think I had a very good counselor.

However, questions about the player's application in games isn't exactly something that is new following his previous spells in France with Amiens and Lyon.
 In fact, Sullivan Martinet, a former teammate of Ndombele at Guingamp, explained that the player "did not really give the impression of wanting to surpass oneself" when asked about his release from the club as a youngster.
 Prior to his move to Amiens, Ndombele had trials with Caen, Auxerre and Angers but all three elected against offering him a contract due to concerns over his weight.
 Having excelled at Amiens after a slow start, the midfielder joined Lyon on a season-long loan deal with a view to a permanent move after catching Bruno Genesio's eye.

 The local authority said it was considering only allowing clients to spend up to 30 minutes taking breakfast and 90 minutes for lunch and supper, but this has not yet been confirmed.
 It has been reported that more restrictions will be lifted throughout the country during June, although restaurants could still be limited to a capacity of just 50 per cent with ‘strict social distancing’ among customers.

With no industry, in fact, practically little modern-day activity, having occurred on Vis for much of the 20th century, the waters around the island have remained crystal clear. As a result, the diving here is outstanding. Given the rocky coastline here, it's no surprise that many a boat has come to grief and interesting dive sites are therefore plentiful. But the prime find here, for experienced divers only, is a huge Flying Fortress plane that went down over Cape Polivalo one night in November 1944. Now sunk to a depth of 70 metres, it's visible from way above, its exterior remarkably intact. The Komiža-based Issa Diving Center can also take you on dives to more accessible wrecks, such as to the Greek cargo ship Vassilios which you can enter with the aid of an underwater lamp.

My first day at Eden Prairie News was Nov. 7, 2018 − the day after the midterm elections. I walked into the office of reporters who had been up until 3 a.m. waiting for results and making sure the print edition went to press. Though they were exhausted, they warmly welcomed me into the fold.
 A year later, I found myself in their shoes while covering the district's school board elections. It was my first election night newsroom pizza, a ritual held across the county. I'd had late nights before, covering City Council meetings and town halls, but it was the election night pizza that felt like a shared tradition, connecting me to countless bleary-eyed reporters across the world and through time.
 It's the community that makes it worth it. Everywhere I went, the people of Eden Prairie welcomed me just as my colleagues did. Though I was a stranger − not even a Minnesotan − you greeted me with smiles, with answers to my questions, with invitations into your home for a cup of tea or a cookie.
 Though Eden Prairie has 63,000 residents, what I heard from my colleagues and from the leaders I met in my first week of work is true: it does feel like a small town. As I became a regular face at summer concerts at Staring Lake, or Senior Center breakfasts, or a PeopleFest! festivity, your faces grew familiar to me, too.
 One of the high points of my first year on the job was when I went to Eden Prairie Center to cover the Halloween celebration there. As I approached parents to ask if I could photograph their family's costumes, many of them lit up with recognition when I said my name and eagerly shared their thoughts on a recent article I'd written.
 When I learned that Eden Prairie News would be closing, it was a double gut punch. It's scary to be laid off right now, and I know I'm not alone. I loved my work writing about Eden Prairie, and I'm sad to see it end.
 But the larger loss is for the city itself. Eden Prairie is a standout among its neighbors in the southwest suburbs, and in the state. Its businesses draw people from all over the world to its doorstep. Its historic homes and remaining farmland connects us back to its roots as a pioneer's homestead.
 In the broad span of history, Eden Prairie has grown and evolved in the blink of an eye. And Eden Prairie News has been there for over four decades to chart its progress, to hold a mirror up to its residents and show them who Eden Prairie was becoming.
 This is the end for Eden Prairie News, but it doesn't have to be the end for local journalism. This city merits more than the occasional article in a statewide publication. As old newspapers close their doors, I hope that others − more agile, more resilient to changing funding models − will step in to provide the coverage that Eden Prairie deserves.

Clouds are gradually clearing this Tuesday afternoon from west to east, leaving much of New York and western and southern Vermont enjoying some Vitamin D. The NEK and some of NH is locked in under a stubborn overcast, but we're going to all be back on the same page with more sunshine early Wednesday. That leaves us clear tonight; cool and calm, too. Upper 20s to low 30s.
