MIDDLETOWN -- Carson Macedo has made a meteoric rise in the ranks of sprint car drivers.
   
 Macedo comes from a long line of sprint car drivers. His grandfather, Tom Tarlton, started the family tradition. Macedo's father, Tommy Tarlton, has 52 feature wins in the last 12 years.
   
 Macedo, who started racing when he was four, is in his second year with Kyle Larson Racing and currently stands in fourth place in the points standings for the World of Outlaws, the premier sprint car racing series in the world.
   
 Macedo, who finished third in the Arctic Cat All-Star Circuit of Champions race in 2018 at 34 Raceway, will make his second trip to the 3/8-mile oval dirt track on Friday night when the World of Outlaws makes its first stop at 34 Raceway since 2014.
   
 Macedo trails points leader Brad Sweet by 142 points. A victory at 34 Raceway would put Macedo one step closer to reaching his ultimate goal of being a World of Outlaws champion.
   
 "We've had our ups and downs, but with everything going on in the U.S. and the world, we just haven't been able to race as much as we would like," Macedo said. "All in all, I think we've done a consistent job. This is a very tough series with the best drivers in the world."
   
 He won the feature race June 20 at Tri-State Speedway in Haubstadt, Indiana, to jump-start his season with a win. Now, he wants to continue that momentum at a track where he has had success before.
   
 "If I remember right it rained that night a little bit and the track got a little faster than it normally is," Macedo said. "I think we started 10th or 11th and got all the way up to third. We had a really good race car. If we had started up a little further, I think we could have had a shot to win it. It was a pretty good experience."
   
 Macedo's grandfather put him behind the wheel of a quarter-midget car when Macedo was just four or five. When he turned six, his father bought him a junior sprint car. By the time he turned 16, Macedo was driving for Team Tarlton with his father.
   
 "It's always been my dream to drive with the World of Outlaws and I just kept at it," Macedo said. "I am 24 now and this is my full-time job. Traveling is a little exhausting at times, but it's all part of the sport. You have to stay in good physical shape and I have to stay sharp mentally to be the best I can be. I want to win the World of Outlaws championship."
   
 Sprint car racing has taken Macedo from one end of the country to the other and to Australia in the winter, where he races with his close friend, Sean Dyson.
   
 "It's definitely a challenge for me and my team being away from family and loved ones, but it's all part of the deal," Macedo said. "When you run with the World of Outlaws, you are going to be on the road a lot. It's definitely a challenge, but one that I love."
   
 Macedo said part of the challenge of being on the road is trying to eat healthy and stay in shape. He tries to find a balance in life, which is easier said than done when he is on the road most of the year.
   
 "It's all about making good decisions," Macedo said. "We eat out a lot, which is not the best, but you can usually find something healthy, like a salad. I also try to go running every day to make sure I am in shape. You have to stay in shape to drive a sprint car."
   
 Macedo said his typical day usually doesn't begin until late morning.
   
 "I try to sleep in and get some rest on the day of races," Macedo said. "We usually head to the track around four or five, depending on when the driver's meeting is, sometimes a little earlier. The guys get the car ready to go and I will go in the trailer and look at film of the track I am going to be racing that night. Then I put my racing suit on, hop in the car and hit the track."
   
 Macedo says he has very little input into the setup of the car. He trusts his team to have the car ready each and every night. Then, it's up to him to get the car to the front by the end of the show.
   
 "I might talk with the guys a little bit, but I typically let them make all the set-up decisions," Macedo said. "I'm more focused on driving and what I need to do out on the track. I just let them do their jobs."
   
 Macedo has just one goal once the racing begins. He wants to be in victory lane getting interviewed at the end of the night.
   
 "There are a lot of great drivers with the World of Outlaws. It is the most competitive series in the world. But to be the best, you have to race against the best," Macedo said. "I'm going there to win. I want to put down a quick lap in time trials, get to the dash, win our heat and get a good starting spot for the feature and, hopefully, by the end of the night I will stand on the wing and celebrate a win."

Bloomberg) -- Barclays Plc executive Roger Jenkins disparaged financier Amanda Staveley in a phone call with a colleague as the bank desperately negotiated a lifeline deal to avoid a U.K. government bailout at the height of the 2008 financial crisis.
 Jenkins dismissed Staveley as a “dolly-bird” and “tart” while he talked to fellow banker Richard Boath about their negotiations with Middle Eastern investors. Staveley and her firm, PCP Capital Partners LLP, are suing the bank for 1.6 billion pounds ($2 billion) over claims Barclays cheated her out of profits she should have earned by bringing investors into deals that helped save the lender.
 The October 2008 phone call was disclosed as Jenkins, 64, began giving evidence as part of the trial Thursday. “Dolly-bird” is a sexist term which means an attractive but unintelligent young woman.
 “Now, that dolly-bird that represents -- is it -- what’s her name?” Boath asked Jenkins.
 “Amanda Staveley,” Jenkins replied, before explaining that Staveley had been told to telephone him.
 “I can handle dolly-birds,” Jenkins assured Boath.
 Later in the phone call, Jenkins told Boath he’s “going to call the tart,” in reference to Staveley.
 Jenkins and Boath were both unanimously acquitted by a London jury earlier this year in criminal proceedings related to a 2008 deal done with Qatar, during which several embarrassing phone calls were disclosed. Staveley’s lawsuit has dragged Jenkins to court once again to give evidence over four days.
 The Food Sucks, the Sex Is Worse -- The Barclays Trial in Quotes
 The new disclosures come after another former Barclays banker, Stephen Jones, resigned as head of a U.K. finance industry group last month because of “thoroughly unpleasant comments” he made about Staveley. He called PCP “f*ckers” and a “bunch of scum bags” in a phone call to a colleague in October 2008, according to Staveley’s first witness statement. He’s due to give evidence next week.
 “Unknown Broker”
 While the facts of the criminal trial and Staveley’s case are different, both revolve around decisions made during the turbulent period more than a decade ago.
 The situation was fraught as Barclays tried to avoid a government bailout that would have come with many restrictions, including some on bonuses and dividends. Jenkins, who was executive chairman of the bank’s Middle East business, was promised a 25 million-pound bonus for the work.
 In Jenkins’ witness statement, he said it would have been “absurd” to entrust Staveley to raise vital funds for the bank during the 2008 crash.
 Staveley was “an unknown broker with no capital markets experience,” Jenkins said. Barclays President Bob Diamond “simply would not have allowed us to delegate the task of raising vital funds for our parent bank to PCP,” he said.
 Last month, as the trial kicked off, emails between Jenkins and other executives were disclosed. He complained that “Amanda gets all the limelight,” rather than his then-wife Diana, who he said wasn’t getting enough credit for helping to bring key Middle Eastern investors on board.
 Barclays Banker Complained ‘Amanda Gets All the Limelight’
 He repeated the complaint that Staveley was engineering press coverage to paint herself as the architect of the lifeline from Qatar and Abu Dhabi.
 “My impression was that Ms. Staveley was seeking to use her involvement in the deal to generate publicity for herself,” he said in his witness statement Thursday.

Focusing on third and fourth, Chelsea are in the driving seat but Man United are just two points behind in fifth and Leicester are sandwiched in-between them in fourth. The Foxes have looked disjoined since the restart, and for many months, while Man United are surging and have all the momentum in the top four. If fifth place does become a Champions League spot, Wolves, Sheffield United, Arsenal and Tottenham seem like outside bets to finish above one of Man United, Leicester and Chelsea to finish fifth. At this point, I think Man United will finish third, Chelsea fourth and Leicester fifth. It will all come down to Leicester v. Man United on the final day of the season.

On the nose, this feels like a classical, decently aged bourbon: Plenty of caramel, vanilla, some oaky char and a good amount of baking spices (cinnamon, ginger, clove). On the palate it feels slick and moderately viscous, with plenty of peppery rye spice and a growing hint of black cherry that swells on repeated sips. Dare we say, this one actually tastes a bit older than it is, especially in terms of the oak and spice complexity that is present. It has a nice rye character without seeming like a rye whiskey, because it never loses its fullness of body or corny sweetness, all of which make it a joy to drink neat.

The 33-year-old Posey was the healthiest he had been in years in the spring, hitting .455 in exhibition games this year before spring training was halted March 12 because of the virus outbreak.
 Posey had undergone season-ending surgery on his right hip in August 2018 and said he still had discomfort running and making even the smallest of movements last season.
 He batted a career-low .257 last season and has just 12 homers in 803 at-bats the last two years combined.
 With Posey out for the season, that could open up an opportunity for heralded prospect Joey Bart, the team’s first-round pick in 2018 but Zaidi said he doesn’t want to rush him.
 “This is a tough environment to evaluate young position players that you maybe went into the situation thinking they needed more competitive reps at the upper levels, Double A, Triple A,” Zaidi said.
 “We’re having these workouts they’re live BP, a guy takes a big swing and hits a ball 430 feet. That’s all well and good but it’s not really a substitute for getting the hundred, 200, 300 at-bats that you might be getting in Double- and Triple-A where you get a much better sense of whether a guy’s capable of handling Major League pitching on a day in, day out basis," he said.
 The other options for catcher on the roster are minor league journeyman Tyler Heineman, Rob Brantly and Chadwick Tromp.
 The 29-year-old Heineman has spent eight years bouncing around the minors with just five games of experience in the majors.
 Brantly, who turns 31 next week, has played just 28 games in the majors over the past six seasons.
 The 25-year-old Tromp was a promising prospect for the Reds until he required shoulder surgery in 2018.
 Zaidi said the team will look to add another catcher to the roster, either as an extra body to catch bullpen sessions or a more proven player to compete for playing time.
 Major League Baseball is scheduled to start the season on July 23. There were two games set for opening day, including the Giants taking on Los Angeles ace Clayton Kershaw at Dodger Stadium.

“Value” is notoriously hard to define, given that every consumer has their own idea of what constitutes good value, and what they’re willing to pay for various products. And when it comes to bourbon, drinkers who have been around the scene for a long time may find it difficult to accept that _any_ of the whiskeys around right now constitute a great value. That’s thanks to the fact that the price of whiskey has soared in the last decade, as the nation’s rediscovery of brown spirits led to an emerging market for luxe, ultra-premium spirits to cater to the high-rolling whiskey aficionado. These high price tags, in turn, seemed to have a gravitational effect upon the budget brands of yore, pulling them steadily upward. Although attention and debate have often been directed toward the $100 and beyond bottles, it’s been the creep of $10 bottles into the $20 and $30 range that is arguably a bigger deal in the long run.

At the heart of almost all issues that come before the executive committee is the governmental status of our tribal nations, including our sovereign right to self-determination.
 Culturally, it has always been important to meet face to face when discussing issues of this gravity, but because of the coronavirus pandemic that is simply not possible. With technology, we are able to meet our friends and colleagues, conduct essential business and take a collective stand on issues impacting our governments.
 As president of the Inter-Tribal Council, I want our tribal citizens to know that our business does not stop. We will never stop creating and advocating for policies that serve us all. We know the Cherokee Nation, the Five Civilized Tribes of Oklahoma and all Indian Country can help carry a national message of unity and hope in this trying age. And we know that what we collectively accomplish today will serve our tribal nations long after COVID-19 has been defeated.
  _Chuck Hoskin Jr. is the principal chief of the Cherokee Nation._

A similar distinction could be made in judging both artists and their art. It is one thing to expel Woody Allen from our archives and banish his work (Europe is exhibiting both of his new films), but does that suggest that society should systematically weigh in on the morality of every other artist? Is a company like Netflix obligated to review every old movie it shows to judge whether cops were presented in too heroic a light? Should every period picture like _Gone With the Wind_ require an introductory panel to contextualize its content? One industry poll suggests a slim majority would answer yes.

And they were still 99 runs in front after openers Rory Burns and Dom Sibley survived a tricky 10 overs to take England to 15-0 in their second innings at stumps.Stokes' haul included the wicket of West Indies captain Jason Holder for just five, with the England talisman having fallen to his rival all- rounder during the towering seamer's Test-best 6-42 on Thursday.And when Stokes bowled tailender Alzarri Joseph, he had his 150th Test wicket.But wicketkeeper Dowrich held firm with a fine fifty until a 115-ball innings featuring eight boundaries ended when he was caught down the legside by opposing gloveman Jos Buttler off Stokes.It was not the first time Dowrich had proved a thorn in England's side.Last year he made 116 and shared a huge stand of 295 with Holder when his fellow Bajan made an unbeaten 202 during the West Indies' 381-run win over England in the first Test at their Kensington Oval home ground.That victory helped West Indies regain the Wisden Trophy but it is 32 years since they last won a Test series in England.Archer and Wood struggleEngland dropped veteran paceman Stuart Broad for this current match to play express quicks Jofra Archer and Mark Wood together for the first time in a Test.But Archer and Wood struggled to make an impression on a placid pitch. They took just one wicket between them in a combined 44 overs -- and that was only when Wood bowled last man Shannon Gabriel to end the innings.West Indies resumed behind closed doors on 57-1, with the first sunny blue skies of the match providing ideal conditions for batting.Barbados-born Archer nearly had Shai Hope lbw for 16 but a West Indies review revealed a no-ball.Hope, however, was still on 16 when he edged off-spinner Dom Bess to first slip where Stokes, captaining England in the absence of Joe Root, held a sharp catch.It was an encouraging moment for Stokes, who could have been forgiven for second-guessing himself after deciding to bat first on winning the toss.But, as he has so often done before, Stokes made a vital breakthrough when he trapped Brathwaite in front of the stumps.Shamarh Brooks made a promising 39 before he was caught behind off James Anderson, with England's all-time leading Test wicket-taker returning figures of 3-62.Jermaine Blackwood gave his wicket away by driving Bess (2-51) straight to Anderson at mid-off.Dowrich, however, drove Bess for two fours in three balls before, on 25, he hammered a drive the Somerset bowler could only parry.Roston Chase drove the first delivery with the new ball, from Wood, for four before he was lbw to Anderson for a defiant 47 off 142 balls.Following his bowling heroics on Thursday, Holder said he wanted to score a Test hundred in England as well.But he fell in single figures when, undone by a surprise bouncer, he hooked Stokes straight to Archer at long leg.",

I am deeply offended and sickened by the brutal killings of George Floyd and other people of color by police officers. They have sometimes been treated as people less than human. That is absolutely unacceptable.
   
 I, as a white male, have had very little contact with police in my many decades of life. The few times I have had accidents or was caught speeding, I was treated with respect. I don't know, of course, how people of color would have been treated in those situations.
   
 I hear cries of "defund the police," but we need police to help keep the peace. I don't agree with defunding. Police certainly need to be in training about how to relate to all people, especially people of color. They need to be helped to defuse situations with calmness. Sometimes social workers or psychologists need to be involved more than police.
   
 On a related issue, too many people of color have been incarcerated for many years. Very often the sentences for people of color are much longer for them than the sentences for white people, even for the same offenses. And prisons should be correctional institutions, not penal institutions.
   
 When I lived in Minnesota in the mid-1970s, I became part of a program called Amicus (Latin for "friend"). The first prisoner I was assigned to had been in and out of juvenile institutions. After becoming an adult, he was sent to Stillwater Prison and decided to turn his life around. He joined a Christian group. He took part in a welding training program. When he got out, he became a welder and got married and became a very good citizen. I have been in touch with him ever since.

Last night, I went to bed with Harry Styles. Thanks to the Calm app, you can too. This week, he collaborated with the meditation brand to read a sleep story titled, "Dream With Me." The 30-minute narration is intended to lull listeners into a satisfying night's sleep thanks to his sensual British voice.
 When I first realized that a Harry Styles bedtime story was entering the world I thought, "Where?" "How?" and "What are the ethics of taking a sleep aide at 3 p.m. on a Wednesday?" But by the time I actually settled in for the story, I had my doubts about whether Harry could direct me into a Watermelon Sugar slumber. (This is, after all, the same man who made us horny for produce and tiny mustaches in 2020.)
 Still, I wanted to give the Consent King the benefit of the doubt. So I slipped into my softest pair of pajamas, applied some essential oils, and sipped a glass of white vino for good measure. (All in the name of journalism, they say.) Everything was arranged for an ideal night's sleep. The only problem: listening to Harry Styles whisper sweet nothings into my ear made me want to do anything but nod off.

Bloomberg) -- The Republican National Committee is working alongside President Donald Trump’s campaign to recruit Black, Latino and Asian-Pacific American voters to support his re-election even as the president has faced criticism for stoking racial tensions and culture wars.
 The groups are reaching out directly to potential voters and the RNC is also targeting minority-focused media outlets to tout Trump’s message. In recent weeks it placed op-eds in Spanish and Asian outlets to tout the start of the U.S. Mexico-Canada Agreement on trade.
 The efforts are an extension of a Republican report after the 2012 election that concluded the party needed to attract more minorities to expand its base, according to party officials. In 2016 against Hillary Clinton, Trump drew only 8% of the Black vote, 28% of the Latino vote and 27% of the Asian vote.
 Republicans are mindful that Trump won several states by slim margins and see any improvement this November as a chance to help in his fight against Joe Biden, who is leading in polls nationally and in battleground states.
 “It’s really about building the base of the party,” Swati Singh, strategic initiatives director for the RNC, said. “We’re recruiting volunteers that are taking the message to their communities.”
 Growing Electorate
 Hispanics will account for about 13.3% of the electorate in 2020, nearly double the levels in 2000, according to the Pew Research Center. Blacks will comprise 12.5% of the electorate and Asians 4.7%, according to Pew.
 A June New York Times-Siena College poll, conducted June 17-June 22, showed that only 5% of Blacks would vote for Trump and 25% of Hispanics would do so, a drop from 2016. The poll showed Biden getting 50% of votes from other non- Whites.
 The RNC is training volunteers who knock on doors, make phone calls, host meet-ups and other events as well as participate in voter registration drives, Singh said. The calls are being made in seven different languages.
 “Because of the leadership, policies and inclusive economy of President Trump, we have been able to take our conservative message directly to a diverse group of voters, be it Black, Latino, or Asian Pacific Americans, and it is paying off,” RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel, said in an emailed statement.
 At his rallies and in other public remarks, Trump touted low unemployment figures for African-Americans and other minorities before the economy was decimated by the coronavirus pandemic. Last week, in delivering remarks to highlight the June jobs report figures, he mentioned gains made by minorities.
 “African-American workers -- really happily for me -- made historic gains with 404,000 jobs added last month alone, and that’s a record,” Trump said. “Likewise, Hispanic employment is up by 1.5 million jobs, a record by a lot. Hispanic employment up 1.5 million jobs.”
 But the nation has been reeling from nationwide protests over racial injustice and police brutality after George Floyd, a Black man, died in police custidy in Minneapolis in late May. In the resulting discussions about race, many people have demanded the country rethink Confederate monuments. But Trump has come down firmly on the side of keeping those honors. He has promised to protect any statues and threatened to veto legislation that would strip Confederate generals’ names from military bases.
 Nascar ‘Hoax’
 Earlier this week, Trump suggested Nascar’s only Black full-time driver, Bubba Wallace, should apologize after a rope fashioned like a noose was found in his garage, calling the episode a “HOAX.” In the same tweet, Trump said the racing circuit’s decision to ban the Confederate flag had hurt its television ratings.
 The president has also dismissed many racial justice protests as riots and called “Black Lives Matter” a “symbol of hate.” He criticized a New York City plan to paint the phrase on the street outside of Trump Tower. He’s also publicly referred to Covid-19, which was first identified in China, as “Kung Flu,” a racial slur.
 A Monmouth University poll released July 8 found that 62% of Americans think that Trump’s handling of the protests has worsened matters. The poll also showed that 66% of Americans believe that the country has become more divided since Trump’s 2016 election.
 Paris Dennard, the RNC’s senior communications adviser for Black media affairs, says voters care more about the president’s record toward their communities than rhetoric. He said that while the “media’s going to focus on the record,” as it did in 2016, Trump now has a record to point to in terms of how his policies have impacted those constituencies.
 “So when people ask ‘what do we say, what do you do, how do you respond,’ we always point them back to the winning record, because the record really speaks for itself, in terms of what this president has been doing to support the lives of minorities in this country,” Dennard said.
 Beyond the employment gains for minorities under his administration, Trump and Republicans also point to the 2018 First Step Act, which reduces prison sentences. They also cite increased funding for Historically Black Colleges and Universities as well as support for the opportunity zone program targeting inner-city communities.

 The Kewanee Police Department has confirmed that the juvenile subject involved in a shooting in Princeton last week that resulted in the death of a Princeton teen is now in custody.
 Police Chief Troy Ainley said sometime last week, either late Wednesday or early Thursday, the subject turned himself into the police.
 The minor, whose name and the city he is from is not being released due to his age, is reportedly being held in custody. Chief Ainley said he had no further information on the juvenile's current status or where he was being held. The department likewise did not make an announcement when the juvenile was taken into custody, though the manhunt for a second Kewanee suspect continues.
 On July 1, shortly after 4 pm., the Princeton Police Department was called to a trailer park on a disturbance call. On the scene, the police located a teen, Caleb Conrath, 17, with gunshot wounds. Conrath later died from his injuries. Another victim was transported to the hospital with non-life threatening injuries.
 The two male subjects made their way to Kewanee, abandoning their car on the outskirts of town before taking off on foot. At least eight area law enforcement agencies joined in the hunt for the two males in Kewanee neighborhoods. Neither of the subjects were located.
 On July 3, the Princeton Police Department issued a warrant for the arrest of Davijon Robinson, 18, of Kewanee. Robinson has yet to be apprehended.

Fans who request a pause on their tickets for the 2020 season would "retain the ability to purchase (the) same seating location in 2021," the team said in its e-mail. Their seats would be released for only the 2020 season, the Seahawks said, with the current season-ticket holder then having the ability to take them back in 2021.
 Season-ticket holders can also take what the team is calling a "wait and see" approach to the 2020 season.
 That means fans can keep their credit on account for the 2020 season as the team confirms details and "government mandates" for the season, with no changes being made to their season ticket membership for now.
 Fans who take the "wait and see" option would have priority for ticket options if stadium capacity changes to impact their seat locations, or if games are changed/cancelled. Any unused credits from 2020 would roll over to the 2021 season or be refunded, at the request of the season-ticket holder.
 Fans who request refunds will have their refunds applied to their most- recently used credit cards, with the team saying it will take 4-6 weeks for the refund to be processed.
 NFL teams have already been told that the first eight rows at every stadium will be unavailable for seating this year "to allow for proper on-field distancing" of players, coaches and staffers. That will cut into every team's seating capacity.
 At least one team, the Baltimore Ravens, has already announced it will reduce its seating capacity to under 14,000 for the 2020 season in an attempt to adhere to social-distancing guidelines.
 The Seahawks have had official sellouts for every game played at CenturyLink Field since the 2003 season, a streak of 146 straight.
 The Seahawks last year sold 61,000 season tickets, with a renewal rate of 97 percent, which the team said was the seventh consecutive season it had a renewal rate of 97 percent or better.
 The record attendance for a football game at CenturyLink Field is 69,190 against the Eagles in 2016.
 NFL training camps are scheduled to open July 28, with the league continuing to devise protocols for adhering to social distancing guidelines while still practicing and preparing for the season.
 The league has yet to officially announce what will happen with the preseason schedule. The league has been hoping to have each team play at least two preseason games (one home game for each team) while the Players Association has said it does not want to play any.
 The Seahawks first game is scheduled for Sept. 13 at Atlanta with the first home game on Sept. 20 against the New England Patriots.

 The first mentioning of vampires, undead creatures that feed off human blood to sustain their existence, goes back to the middle 17th century when the word appeared in an English travelogue. The belief in the voracious creatures was popularized by the works of John Polidori and Bram Stoker.
 A vampire hunter’s kit is up for auction in England, that’s according to a press release by Hansons Auctioneers and Valuers auction house published on Wednesday. According to the auction house, the lot will go under the hammer on 16 July and is expected to fetch between $2,500 and $3,800.

Katie wrote yesterday that even prior to this Sullivan is refusing to drop the case. Well, he looks even more absurd now. All that’s left is watching this man destroy himself instead of just moving on, as the rest of the country has from this fake news story regarding Russian collusion.
 Oh, and let’s not forget, based on the notes from disgraced ex-FBI Agent Peter Strzok, that the Logan Act angle was suggested by none other than former Vice President Joe Biden, who has said he knew nothing about the Flynn investigation. Obama ordered the DOJ/FBI to get the “right people” on this Flynn probe, as he prepped his top security officials and gave marching orders on how to protect the FBI’s counterintelligence investigation from the incoming Trump team. That January 5, 2017 meeting should be marked as when Obama pretty much gave the order for his team to take out Flynn.
 Strzok was the former top counterintelligence who reportedly signed off on the FBI's collusion probe in July of 2016 before Robert Mueller took it over following the firing of James Comey in May of 2017. Strzok was also a key point person in the review of Hillary Clinton's email server, two of the most politically sensitive investigations to hit the bureau in recent memory. He was also staunchly anti-Trump, as evidenced in the tens of thousands of texts he sent to his mistress, Lisa Page, an FBI lawyer. This revelation forced Meuller to remove him from the investigation, where he was reassigned to human resources. He was eventually fired for his unprofessional misconduct which cast doubt on the credibility of the FBI as an impartial investigative body.

During the stay-at-home order, many people were faced with obstacles that were unfamiliar to their everyday lives as social workers in Onslow County expected a rise in child abuse cases.
   
 What they saw was the numbers declined, however reporting options and emergency circumstances for serving children were holding back professionals who would normally assist those in need.
   
 Onslow Partnership for Children Sarah Parrish works as a multidisciplinary team coordinator for their child advocacy center (CAC). She explained during the stay-at-home order, the CAC was only able to serve children under emergencies.
   
 "On March 16, we began serving families on an emergency basis only in the CAC due to COVID-19. That means we were only seeing children if they met a certain criteria," said Parrish.
   
 The criteria Parrish listed was if medical intervention is needed emergently to ensure the health and safety of the child, if the disclosed sexual assault may have occurred within the previous 72 hours, if there may be need for post- exposure prophylaxis for sexually transmitted infections, if the child complains of pain in the genital or anal area or other physical injury, if there is evidence or complaint of anogenital bleeding or injury, or if the child is experiencing significant behavioral or emotional problems and/or needs evaluation for possible suicidal ideation.
   
 Emergent cases with significant physical trauma and/or need for significant evidence collections, will typically not be examined at the CAC, added Parrish. "The individual should be taken to the nearest hospital for treatment, preferable a hospital that has a child abuse pediatrician on call or a pediatric Sexual Assault Examiner or SANE-P, where evidence collection will follow standard procedures."
   
 The CAC typically serve children from birth up to their 18th birthday for allegations of sexual abuse and other cases upon request. Parrish explained cases can include physical abuse, witnessing a serious crime such as domestic violence or homicide, or if children have experienced long-term neglect.
   
 "In those cases any time a report is made to law enforcement or if a child discloses any of those acts to a social worker, the investigator will schedule an appointment with the CAC for the child to be interviewed and have a medical exam," said Parrish.
   
 Onslow County Department of Social Services Deputy Director Cambell Fletcher explained even though they stayed available for normal operations during COVID-19 restrictions, she believes as children are returning to somewhat of a normal structure, cases could increase.
   
 Fletcher added they had also seen a drop in cases during the last few months and believes it was related to the lack of professionals interacting with children.
   
 "We know a lot of our professional services are schools and those doing telecounseling or having more limited appointments with different professionals in the community, and those are often times individuals who are helping us make sure children are safe," said Fletcher.
   
 Parrish added, the more children are around trusted adults outside of the home, the more likely they will disclose inappropriate things that either have happened or may currently be happening int he home.
   
 The impact of a child dealing with abuse or neglect may not immediately arise in the early years of their life. Struggling with the past during one's adult life could be just as dramatizing and that is exactly what Onslow County native Darrian Brown lives with today.
   
 Brown explains the abuse she experienced as a child has given her anxiety and depression, along with the fear that she will treat her kids the way she was treated. She added she is at a much higher risk for medical conditions because of her adverse childhood.
   
 Having her childhood diminished by physical, verbal, and emotional abuse at the hands of her mother and step-father, Brown said situations like the stay- at-home order was exactly what an abuser wanted.
   
 "As an adult and a professional in the field of social work, I can tell you that situations like this stay-at-home order are similar to a death sentence for a child who is undergoing abuse," said Brown. "They are exactly where their abuser wants them. They are hidden, easily accessible, and extremely vulnerable. There is no one for these kids to turn to."
   
 When asked to explain several reasons parents would abuse their children during this time, Brown added there is no excuse for it, however for some adults, they have lost their income and are angry or scared. Their kids are antsy from being stuck inside and everyone is on edge, which is how some abuse starts. Parents and caretakers are on edge and not thinking straight while having to develop a new normal.
   
 Brown hopes that as a community, awareness can be raised to allow such a difficult topic to be discussed.
   
 "This is a community issue because one day, these children will be the ones that will be making decisions for us. We as a community can tackle this problem but we all have to do our parts," said Brown.

“Everybody wants to know what it will look like when I go back to my classroom,” Nelson said.
 Shawn Hime, executive director of the state School Boards Association, said districts are “working fast and furious” on reopening plans in what has been a “roller coaster of a pandemic.”
 “Schools have been very concerned about putting all the safeguards possible to protect their older staff members and those with underlying health conditions,” he said.
 As districts are finalizing plans, officials are waiting on new reopening guidelines from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. State health recommendations for public schools also are expected in the coming weeks.
 Hime said everyone understandably wants answers today. With rapidly evolving COVID-19 science and guidance, districts are reluctant to announce permanent- sounding plans six to eight weeks before school starts.
 “I think the sense of uncertainty does add to anxiety,” Hime said. “It’s new for all of us. I believe that school officials are doing everything they can to collect data and create the best plan possible to protect students, their staff and to create options as the situation changes.”
 In the frontlines
 Cole, the Duncan teacher, also runs a popular Oklahoma education Facebook group with 65,000 members.
 She said educators are watching closely as districts begin to unveil reopening plans. Teachers want to see what safeguards will be put in place to protect not only instructors, but students and families.
 Cole’s district tentatively plans to offer students three attendance options that range from in-person to 100 percent virtual to a mix of the two.
 Logistical questions linger across the state, Cole said.
 Educators wonder who will step in to teach if they fall ill. Advocates say the pandemic only will exacerbate the state's ongoing substitute teacher shortage.
 They’re also extremely worried that existing sick leave policies aren’t adequate, Cole said. Those exposed to COVID-19 may be forced to self- quarantine for days or face lengthy recoveries. Teachers with decades of experience may have a lot of sick time banked, but newer educators may not.
 Also, Cole said many teachers feel like they’ve been excluded from the reopening discussion – even though they’ll be the ones on the frontlines.
 “A lot of teachers have felt that we’re being overlooked,” Cole said. “We’re the silent ones. We’re going to be the ones that are in trenches. We only want what’s best for our students and our families as well.”

However, Sullivan said that REC needs to resolve its $9.2 million outstanding property tax bill with Grant County in order to help Violet Power go forward with the project.
 "We are doing what we can to turn it around," Sullivan said. "We are trying to resolve this, and it's important to resolve this on good terms."
 Neither Sullivan nor Grant County Commissioner Tom Taylor said they could give any details about a proposed tax settlement.
 "REC has approached us with a settlement, but I cannot discuss the settlement specifics," Taylor said. "We're still exploring our options."
 Currently, REC owes back taxes of $4.85 million along with an additional $4.32 million in interest and penalties on its 206-acre production facility near the corner of Wheeler Road and Road N Northeast in Moses Lake.
 Norway-based REC produces solar-grade silicon for use in making solar power modules. However, in 2013 China imposed steep tariffs on REC's solar-grade silicon, effectively blocking the company from selling to Chinese solar module producers. Currently, Chinese companies account for more than 90 percent of the world's solar module and panel production.
 As a result, REC slowly laid off most of its roughly 500 employees, and it shut down production last year. It also disputed Grant County's valuation of the facility over the last few years, noting that a factory that cannot sell its products isn't worth what the county said it was.
 In quarterly earnings reports since late 2018, REC Silicon President and CEO Tore Torvund said the company has been looking at alternative uses for its sole product — nearly pure silicon gas — either to improve rechargeable batteries or in domestic solar panel production.
 In fact, Sullivan said REC has also been talking with two battery manufacturers that are interested in locating in Moses Lake.
 Despite strong demand for solar power in the U.S., few companies have sought to take the leap and manufacture them here.
 However, Violet Power is proposing "a state of the art solar manufacturing facility" in Moses Lake "which will free the U.S. from dependence on imported Chinese solar panels while fabricating and delivering complete solar systems that are cyber secure at an industrial scale," according to a company proposal.
 Sullivan said Violet Power is looking at locating across the road from REC's plant in order to have access to the company's "low-cost silicon."
 "They've been to Moses Lake and looked at the site," she said.
 Sullivan said that if the tax deal could be worked out, Violet Power presents "an interesting opportunity" for high-tech manufacturing and job development that would be good for the "general overall health" of the region.
 "This is a unique opportunity for Grant County," she said.

Orlando (EE.UU.), 10 jul (EFE).- El veterano base Rajon Rondo, de Los Angeles Lakers, se convirtio este viernes en el ultimo jugador de la NBA que al llegar a la 'burbuja' de Orlando se quejo de las condiciones de su alojamiento, en su caso de la habitacion de hotel que le habian asignado.
 Rondo, que como profesional ha ganado mas de 100 millones de dolares en los 14 años que lleva en la NBA, mostro su disgusto a traves de su red social de Instagram al definir su alojamiento en el Gran Destino Tower, en el Disney's Coronado Springs Resort, como el de un Motel 6, que son los mas economicos que hay en el pais.
 La queja de Rondo sobre el estandar de lujo de la habitacion ha confirmado el nivel de vida que llevan los jugadores de la NBA y tambien el tipo de servicio que reciben las personas que hacen turismo en Walt Disney World.
 Los Lakers, como segundo mejor equipo de la liga, tuvo la distincion de ser llevado al que se supone es el mejor hotel de los tres que la NBA ha designado para darle alojamiento a los 22 equipos que van a reiniciar la competicion de la temporada regular a partir del proximo 30 de julio.
 En su segunda temporada con los Lakers, Rondo tiene promedios de 7,1 puntos; 5,0 asistencias y 3,0 rebotes, marcando su produccion mas baja desde su campaña de novato 2006-07.
 Antes de la queja de Rondo, el base Tyus Jones, de los Grizzlies de Memphis, tambien a traves de su cuenta de Instagram publico una foto mostrando lo que parecia ser una cucaracha muerta, acompañada con el subtitulo de "Oh, no".
 La foto parecia haber sido tomada en su habitacion. Grizzlies, junto con Sixers de Filadelfia, Rockets de Houston, Pacers de Indiana, Mavericks de Dallas, Nets de Brooklyn y Orlando Magic se hospedan en el Grand Floridian.
 Otro base, Troy Daniels, de los Nuggets de Denver, fue el primero en publicar sobre la falta de calidad en su cena.
 Su comida, que se publico en las redes sociales, atrajo una serie de bromas de personas que comparaban la mostrada por Daniels con la comida del avion, el desastroso Festival Fyre y el almuerzo servido en la cafeteria de la escuela.
 El periodico The New York Times aclaro que la comida que se muestra en la foto es solo para jugadores en sus primeras 48 horas de cuarentena cuando llegan, al igual que sucedio con la Liga Profesional de Futbol (MLS) de Estados Unidos, que tambien ha iniciado la competicion en la 'burbuja' de Orlando.
 Los jugadores de la MLS ya tienen acceso a una variedad de restaurantes una vez que termino su periodo de cuarentena inicial.

This distillery, despite being one of the old Kentucky stalwarts, has a way of flying under the radar despite the fact that they make some very good bourbon and routinely win awards. That’s just sort of become part of the distillery’s identity, so Very Old Barton is a perfect budget flagship, although it’s not the most widely available on this list.

HBO Max is working on a police drama set in the same universe as the upcoming Batman movie, which stars Robert Pattinson as the Caped Crusader. Matt Reeves, the director of The Batman, is developing the show with Warner Bros. Television, Boardwalk Empire creator Terence Winter (who'll act as writer and executive producer) and The Batman producer Dylan Clark.The streaming service has given the untitled show a series commitment. According to a press release, it'll be "set in the world Reeves is creating for The Batman feature film and will build upon the motion picture's examination of the anatomy of corruption in Gotham City, ultimately launching a new Batman universe across multiple platforms. The series provides an unprecedented opportunity to extend the world established in the movie and further explore the myriad of compelling and complex characters of Gotham." HBO Max already has a number of DC-related projects with others in the works, but it could do with some more major original programming. Tapping into the most popular DC character and building on an upcoming blockbuster movie seems like a solid choice. It's unclear whether Pattinson will make any appearances in the show, but if he does, that might persuade some of his fans to sign up to HBO Max. In any case, it's a fairly safe bet that a show set in the world of The Batman will pull in some subscribers.There's no word as yet on when you can expect to start streaming this show. However, given that it's in development, and most TV and movie productions are on hold amid the pandemic, we're probably in for quite a wait. The Batman, meanwhile, will be released on October 1st, 2021.

So, the time periods are roughly comparable, with most of the COVID-19-related deaths occurring since late March.

 Oh, right.  
 Let's call a spade a spade. From an aesthetic standpoint, the Nazi SS outfit is very well-designed. The long coat tied around the waist with a buckle portrays a slim, sturdy visage. The leather boots and matching cap look harsh and powerful. The emblem placements on the lapel naturally suggest rank and authority. And the red armband lends a splash of color to what would otherwise be a dark monotone. If the Nazi uniform wasn't so closely tied with the atrocities they committed during WWII, it wouldn't seem out of place at Fashion Week.

North Georgia Animal Alliance dog coordinator Dave Mayo was in for quite a surprise on July 6 when NGAA volunteer Sara DeBerry asked him to meet her at Catoosa County Animal Control.
 “I assumed it was about a story on NGAA,” says Mayo. “But then I saw Sara walking toward me with a stack of hundred-dollar bills in her hand and I thought, ‘Is this what I think it is?’”
 Mayo was the recipient of News Channel 9’s (and sponsored by McMahan Law Firm) $500 “Pay it Forward” award that honors people in the community who go the extra mile to make the world a better place. He was nominated by DeBerry for his work rescuing dogs from the Catoosa shelter and other places and for the thousands of miles he logs each year getting dogs to vets, foster homes and other rescues.
 “I really didn’t feel like I deserved it,” says Mayo. “I see so many other people doing so much out there.”
 But DeBerry says Mayo definitely deserved it. “Dave, he's just rock solid, and you can count on him for anything,” she told Channel 9 reporter Jessica Harthorn. “He's just always willing to help, you let him know and he's there."
 One of Mayo’s most recent adventures rescuing dogs started with a lady who lives near Villanow.
 “The lady,” says Mayo, “had been feeding a mama dog and her 11 puppies.”
 Mayo helped the lady catch 10 of the energetic puppies, which were transferred to a rescue 800 miles away. Mayo left a trap with the lady, but weeks went by without catching the other pup or the mama.
 Then one day, Mayo got a call. A dog was in the trap -- a different dog, also a mama. The lady told Mayo she’d been seeing and feeding the trapped dog for around two years and that it had actually helped nurse the puppies belonging to the first dog. The dog, all assumed, was feral.
 Mayo couldn’t find anyone to foster the dog he named Sonja, so he took it home. “She has turned out to be the most wonderful dog,” he says. “She’s clearly not used to people. She won’t look you in the eye. But she’s sweet and quiet. It only took two days to house-train her. She won’t come when you call her, but she’ll stand and wait for you and let you put a leash on her.”
 It’s this sort of thing, says Mayo, that makes his volunteer work so rewarding -- finding ways to provide loving homes for abandoned dogs that clearly appreciate being cared for, fed and sheltered.
 "I love dogs,” Mayo told Channel 9. “I think dogs are special and a gift to us from God and the universe, and they deserve better than a lot of them get."
