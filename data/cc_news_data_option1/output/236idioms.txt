However, I vividly remember some patients and their families that I had to tell the news about. The muscle biopsy that uncovered muscular dystrophy in a young child, the X-ray of the breast in a smoker who revealed a tennis ball-like cancer and the brain CT that showed a walnut-like lesion that would probably grow into a tennis ball and put pressure on the brainstem and force people to take their last breath. Then there was the hasty gait consultation of a neck lump and subsequent biopsy that I did with a colleague who revealed metastatic malignant melanoma that would prove to be fatal.

After progressing with Nice's under-19s, Brazão joined the club's senior set- up in pre-season and earned a decent amount of playing time, suggesting he was nearing his breakthrough into the first team.
 He has so far made just one substitute appearance so far this season, but according to the reports coming out of France it appears Liverpool are hoping to yet again steal a march on their rivals by snapping him up early.
 Jurgen Klopp's side were quick to act in luring Minamino following his impressive Champions league displays for Salzburg, wrapping the deal up early so he could sign on January 1, the day the transfer window opened.
 And they will hope to be similarly ahead of the game if they choose to swoop for Brazão, who has two caps for Portugal U19s.

At this point one of the officers grabbed Edwards’ right arm while the other officer shoved him into the corner of the car door, followed by the officers aggressively grabbing Edwards’ upper body and pushing his head into the corner of the car door as they attempted to place his hands behind his back. One officer then told Edwards to get to the ground, but before he could do so, the officers slammed him to the pavement. As the officers pushed Edwards’ head and neck to the ground, they also placed a knee on his body to pin him to the ground. Edwards repeatedly asked why the officers were abusing him, but got no answer. Instead, the first officer fired a taser at Edwards as he lay on the ground. A third officer arrived on the scene and made two striking motions at Edwards, the impact of which can be heard on the body camera video. A fourth officer arrived at the scene and put Edwards in a chokehold. As the four officers dragged Edwards to the ground, another joined the fray and held Edwards down by digging his knee into his body.

RALEIGH, N.C. — Republican victories in state legislative and gubernatorial elections in 2010 put them in a commanding position the next year to draw new voting districts for the U.S. House and state legislatures that helped fortify Republican power for much of the following decade.
 But the celebration was short-lived for at least one of the Republicans' top redistricting strategists.
 Behind the scenes, GOP consultant Thomas Hofeller was worried that Democrats were far ahead of Republicans in collecting data that could help them draw districts in their favor following the next round of redistricting that will occur after the 2020 census.
 Hofeller died in August 2018 after a battle with cancer. But troves of his previously confidential digital documents, data tables and emails were publicly posted online this month by his estranged daughter, Stephanie Hofeller. She also supplied them to plaintiffs during a legal challenge brought by Democrats and Common Cause against the North Carolina state legislative districts that her father helped draw.
 Stephanie Hofeller did not respond to a request for comment sent through her lawyer.
 The records reviewed by The Associated Press reveal Hofeller's extensive involvement in drafting or defending Republican redistricting efforts against claims of racial or political gerrymandering. He worked not only for statewide efforts, such as in Missouri and Virginia, but even for local ones, such as in Galveston County, Texas, and Nassau County, New York. Hofeller also aided GOP legal challenges to Democratic-friendly maps in Arizona and Maryland.
 Before the 2010 elections, the records reveal that Hofeller also strategized with Republicans about backing a successful California ballot initiative entrusting an independent commission — instead of the Democratic-led Legislature — with the task of congressional redistricting. A draft of one memo said it could help “avoid a GOP disaster" in the 2011 redistricting. More recently, Democrats have been backing successful ballot initiatives for independent commissions or nonpartisan redistricting efforts against the resistance of Republican-led legislatures in states such as Michigan and Missouri.
 The Hofeller records also reveal the degree to which the once-a-decade task of redistricting has turned into a permanent, multi-million-dollar operation for political parties that are angling for every possible advantage to grasp or strengthen power.
 “Redistricting is one of the most profitable and businesslike investment(s) that the GOP can make," stated a draft memo emailed by Hofeller to his GOP consulting partner in December 2014. “Even if it results in only the gain or preservation of one or two additional congressional seat(s) for 10 years, it is more (than) worth this investment.”
 Amid ongoing legal battles stemming from the 2011 redistricting, records show Hofeller already was turning his attention to the redistricting that will occur in 2021.
 A July 2013 redistricting report to the Republican National Committee, stored in Hofeller's electronic files, warned that Democrats “have out-gunned the GOP in data preparation, community involvement and engagement in the redistricting process as well as committing legal resources.”
 “The GOP has been fortunate to have control of state government resources to fend off challenges to its plans in some key states to adequately offset some of these advantages,” the memo stated.
 Hofeller was one of several Republicans who believed the party needed to do more for the next round of redistricting.
 Specifically, he wanted Republicans to establish a permanent redistricting entity . Its task would be to compile a decade's worth of precinct-level election results from around the country that could be matched with 2020 census data to give mapmakers a granular history of which neighborhoods were most likely to vote for Republicans or Democrats.
 He noted that Democrats already had such a database in the hands of the National Committee for an Effective Congress, an entity founded by former first lady Eleanor Roosevelt and her friends in 1948.
 Instead of maintaining an ongoing effort, Republicans had a history of procrastinating — pulling together a redistricting office at the end of a decade and scrambling to compile data. Hofeller's records show a contractor hired by Republicans to build an election-results database for use with the 2010 census figures didn't start work until November 2010, was focused on only a limited number of states and needed more money by the following February.
 In November 2013, Hofeller emailed a couple dozen key GOP officials and consultants with an attached memo outlining a proposal for a permanent Republican data office focused on redistricting and spreadsheets detailing its potential cost. Hofeller suggested an annual budget of more than $1.4 million and a 16-person staff .
 But his plan wasn't implemented. Two years later, Hofeller still was circulating a similar proposal among some Republicans.
 In 2017, Republicans finally established a permanent redistricting operation. The National Republican Redistricting Trust has a broader role and a budget about 10 times larger than what Hofeller proposed, said the trust's executive director, Adam Kincaid, who was one of the recipients of Hofeller's 2013 proposal. The trust is focused not only on building an election-results database that state officials can use in redistricting but also on funding legal fights over maps and generating public awareness about redistricting.
 “The Democrats’ data on redistricting has always been ahead of where the Republicans’ data has been on redistricting," said Kincaid, who was the redistricting coordinator for the National Republican Congressional Committee in 2011 and 2012.
 Part of the task of the National Republican Redistricting Trust "is helping the Republican Party catch up and eventually surpass what the Democrats have been doing for over a generation now.”
 The National Committee for an Effective Congress ramped up its use of precinct-level data for Democratic redistricting efforts following the 2000 and 2010 censuses, said Mark Gersh, a Democratic strategist who has worked with the committee since 1976.
 Yet Gersh said having vast data resources only helps if a political party has the power to make use of them. For example, the Democrats' data did little after the 2010 elections in states such as Michigan and Ohio. The tea party wave helped Republicans win control of the state legislature and governor's offices, which then drew new boundaries for legislative and congressional districts.
 “(Data) probably helped us marginally, but let’s face it: Winning elections for the state legislature or having fair commissions do this is the best way of guaranteeing your success,” Gersh said.

Highlights
 On 16 January, eight individuals who were previously hosted at the Gathering and Depature Facility (GDF) agreed to be transferred to the urban community where they received assistance at the Community Day Centre (CDC) in Tripoli.
 On 15 January, a total of 19 refugees and asylum-seekers were released from Triq Al Sika detention centre, following UNHCR's advocacy. The group, comprising two men, 13 women and four children, were transferred to the CDC. They were provided with core-relief items (CRIs), cash grants and medical assistance.
 Population movements As of 16 January, 947 refugees and migrants have been registered as rescued/intercepted at sea by the Libyan Coast Guard and disembarked in Libya. The majority of the population were disembarked at the Tripoli Commercial Port and Sabratha (80 km west of Tripoli). Over the weekend, there was a spike in rescues/interceptions at sea. This occurrence may be attributable to last week's calm weather. UNHCR and its partner, International Medical Corps, continue to provide medical assistance and CRIs to persons at disembarkation points.
 UNHCR response
 Registration in Libyan detention centres continues. On 13 January, UNHCR conducted a registration visit to Triq Al Sika detention centre in Tripoli where 40 individuals from Somalia, Eritrea, Sudan and Ethiopia were registered. So far in 2020, UNHCR has registered 563 persons of concern held at detention centres in Libya.
 Since the onset of clashes in April 2019, some 150,000 civilians have been displaced from their homes. UNHCR continues to provide humanitarian assistance to internally displaced persons (IDPs) across Libya. In 2019, UNHCR and its local partner, LibAid distributed CRIs to 43,387 IDPs and returnees; shelter kits to 12,707 IDPs and returnees; and provided cash grants to 921 internally displaced families.
 There are currently more than 3,000 refugees and migrants being held in detention centres in Libya. Out of these, 2,039 are persons of concern to UNHCR. Since 2019 until now, UNHCR has conducted over 1,200 monitoring visits to detention centres. These visits allow UNHCR to register persons of concern, identify the most vulnerable for solutions in third countries, and provide humanitarian and medical assistance.

 What qualities do you want to see in the next superintendent?
 The School Committee is beginning the search process to hire a successor to Plymouth School Superintendent Gary Maestas, who will retire at the end of the year. What are three principal qualities you want to see in the next superintendent?
 Pat Adelmann
 The most important quality for the prospective superintendent is a proven commitment to enhancing the school experience for all students, demonstrated by past experience. It is so essential to have a superintendent who isn't just focused on MCAS scores or budgets but someone who will make sure that every child's emotional, physical and academic needs are met. The new superintendent must maintain, enhance, and create programs to support that mission.
 Another vital quality for the new superintendent is the ability to engage the community, parents, students, teachers and government officials in supporting the schools' journey for excellence with accessible, open and positive relationships.
 The next superintendent must also have an aptitude for fiscal responsibility working with the recommendations of our able business manager, Gary Costin.
 The School Committee consists of competent and visionary leaders. I have full confidence that they will make the right choice. Good luck! Dr. Maestas is a tough act to follow.
 Pat Adelmann has been a Plymouth resident since 1977 and is a mother of five Plymouth Public School graduates, a proud grandmother of 12, a former School Committee member and a former Town Meeting representative.
 Jeff Berger
 I was delighted to work with Gary Maestas when I chaired Plymouth's Cable Advisory Committee. When building the new Plymouth North, Supt. Maestas asked us to allocate incremental funding to construction with the help of PACTV and the town, and we did it. The result was and is a first-class studio complex that rivals some I've worked in when I did broadcast news. Finding someone as street-smart, agile, responsive, and focused on quality as Supt. Maestas is a tall order. My suggestion is to ensure that Supt. Maestas set the standards and be intimately involved in the selection process - that way, we'll get someone who is fully equipped to hit the ground running and continue Supt. Maestas' tradition of excellence.
 A Plymouth resident for more than 40 years, Jeff Berger is founder and owner of JMB Communications / websitesthatworkusa.com and everythingsxm.com as well as Northeast Ambassador for SkyMed International, www.getskymed.com. He is a former chairman of Plymouth's Nuclear Matters Committee and its Cable Advisory Committee.
 Karen Buechs
 The new superintendent must have a strong sense of community. The superintendent must do everything in their power to help every student and teacher in reaching their goals. And, at the same time, be ever mindful who pays the bills.
 Karen Buechs was a Town Meeting representative and served as chair of Precinct 7. She sat on the Manomet Steering Committee, Manomet Village Common Inc., Capital Outlay Committee and the Revenue Idea Task Force. She also served as Charter Commission member and on three Charter Review Committees. Karen has been a resident of Plymouth for 46 years.
 David Peck
 While our new superintendent will need far more than three principal qualities, the three I would suggest are Planning, Persuasion and Persistence. Our educational leader must be a good planner, dealing with both short-term and long-term change. There will be changes in educational philosophy and skills needed for the 21st century, and changes in state and federal regulations. The size and nature of our student population continues to change, which will affect the faculty we need and the facilities in which to teach them. Our new superintendent will need to persuade first the School Committee and later the Select Board and Town Meeting, to approve and fund the initiatives and school budget. And our superintendent must be persistent (and patient) in his or her advocacy on behalf of the education of the children of Plymouth. Gary Maestas represents all of these qualities, and far more. Let us hope to find Gary 2.0.
 David Peck is the retired director of Facility Planning at Boston Children's Hospital. He serves as the chairman of the Plymouth Building Committee and vice-chairman of the Zoning Board of Appeals. He is a Town Meeting representative from Precinct 4.
 Roger Silva
 I just don't understand why we never seem to have a person ready to go when one of our head people retire. Don't we plan and train and model a replacement? Seems like we always need countrywide searches!
 Roger Silva is a former five-term Plymouth selectman who began public service as an elected Town Meeting member. He has served on the Advisory and Finance Committee and two charter commissions.

We are introduced for the first time to humans in Narnia other than our four heroes, as the Telmarine people have invaded and ruled Narnia for several hundred years, and are given an answer as to how there are other humans in this world at all. (Narnia, which was implied in the previous book but made abundantly clear here, is a country, not a world.)

The playoff game at Arrowhead Stadium last Sunday will go down in football history as one of the greatest comebacks. Being down by 24 points in any league usually means the party is over, but the Chiefs are built for just such a game.
 The first quarter looked like the first game of the season for a junior high team. A blown coverage, a blocked punt and a muff on the punt return and in an instant, you give up three touchdowns. Most teams would check-up.
 The coaching staff had to have developed great team chemistry and a belief in one another for the team to recover from that type of start. On the sidelines at the game you could see Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce getting in the faces of their teammates and telling them to get with the program.
 The entire coaching staff deserves credit for maintaining composure and staying with the game plan. If they started a 2-minute philosophy while down 24-0, they would have never gotten back into the game.
 The two greatest Chiefs football games ever played were not the two Super Bowl appearances. One was the longest NFL game ever played and was on Christmas Day 1971 against the Dolphins. The Chiefs lost in overtime. That was a team that had played in two of the first four Super Bowls and had already won a Super Bowl in 1970. They were on the verge of becoming an early dynasty in the newly merged NFL.
 The other was the game Sunday. I attended that game as well. The game in 1971 put the organization into a negative spiral that lasted decades. The win Sunday could be the stepping-stone the franchise has been in search of since that cold Christmas Day in 1971.
 The common thread with the two teams from different eras was great quarterback leadership. Len Dawson was every bit as much the "Man" at that time as Patrick Mahomes is today. The difference is that Dawson and the Chiefs were coming down from the mountain top, while Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs are beginning the climb back up to the mountain top.
 Mahomes is made for situations like last Sunday and the organization has surrounded him with talent that allows him to shine. Mahomes plays like a seasoned veteran, even though this is only his second year as an NFL starter. His first touchdown, thrown on a dime, to running back Damien Williams was a thing of beauty. It was a perfect spiral under the armpit of the linebacker at the numbers and Williams never broke stride.
 From that point on the Texans victory party was over. Mahomes and the rest of the team got on board to score 51 points in three quarters. That would be unheard of even in a video game, let alone in a real NFL game.
 This team has the potential and young players to be around the top of the mountain for several years. Sunday was one great victory that showed how explosive the entire team can be when their backs are against the wall.
 The key in the upcoming AFC championship game Sunday at Arrowhead will be if the Chiefs can get on top early. If they play like they did in the first quarter against the Texans, it will spell trouble. Tennessee has a great offensive line and running back Derrick Henry is a stallion!
 The Chiefs have to play on top because the Titans are capable of controlling the clock and letting Henry eat up time and yardage. Hopefully, the Chiefs' defense can put the Titans in long third down situations all day long so Henry will not be able to control the game. Make no mistake, the Titans are not in the championship game by mistake or luck. They are a solid and extremely physical football team. If they have to throw the football 30 times or more, they are in trouble.
 Mahomes and company can beat you a lot of different ways, but the Titans will try to control the clock and the game on the ground. The Chiefs will have a tougher time digging out of a hole against them because of the things they do well as a team. This is a chance for the Chiefs organization to work its way back up to the top of the mountain since that devastating loss in 1971. Go Chiefs!

It was a record-breaking Saturday afternoon for Missouri men's basketball at Alabama.
 Inside Coleman Coliseum in Tuscaloosa, the Tigers went 31-for-31 from the free-throw line, setting the Southeastern Conference record for most free- throw attempts without a miss and falling three short of the NCAA record.
 Missouri still lost by double digits.
 The Crimson Tide navigated through foul trouble to key players James "Beetle" Bolden, Kira Lewis Jr. and Herbert Jones to take down the Tigers 88-74.
 Missouri cut its deficit to three points on three different occasions in the second half but never led throughout the final 35 minutes.
 The Tigers fall to 9-8 overall and 1-4 in the SEC. The Crimson Tide improve to 10-7 overall and 3-2 in league play.
 "This is one of those things you have to learn from -- a painful, painful lesson," Missouri head coach Cuonzo Martin said of the loss. "... I thought we had it right there, but just couldn't get it in the end."
 Alabama's John Petty Jr. led all scorers with 20 points. Missouri had four players in double figures. Dru Smith paced the Tigers with 18 points, followed by Mark Smith with 15. Xavier Pinson and Kobe Brown added 11 points each.
 Martin said the Tigers had about 70 paint touches in the game by driving to the hoop with the ball, a significant rise from the team's previous season high of 40.
 But a Missouri guard didn't make a field goal for the final 7:30, with the Tigers only making three shots during that span overall -- two from Reed Nikko and one from Mitchell Smith. MU attempted 19 shots during that stretch.
 Martin said using positive moments to get over the hump of scoring droughts and defensive lapses is key to success.
 "It's the mental discipline, the focus, the concentration, the attention to detail that is very important every possession down," Martin said. "Maybe one guy has to step up and say, 'Every assignment down, this is what we're doing.'"
 Missouri is the first SEC team to reach four losses in conference play and did so by giving up the fourth-most points in a single game during Martin's tenure. Missouri gave up 92 and 91, respectively, to Auburn over the past two seasons. Mississippi scored 90 in a 2018 overtime game.
 While breaking records from the free-throw line is nice, four SEC losses in five tries have lowered the Tigers' chances of making the NCAA Tournament come March.
 For the first time this season, Brown didn't start the game. Javon Pickett took his spot alongside the trio of Smiths and Nikko. Pickett finished with zero points on 0-for-5 shooting from the floor in 30 minutes.
 Missouri is scheduled to return to action at 8 p.m. Tuesday with a home game against Texas A&M. Then the Tigers head back on the road for their final nonconference game of the regular season as part of the Big 12/SEC challenge against West Virginia.

But that's exactly what he did with Sheryl Crow in 2001 for a career-changing hit that is considered one of our most unforgettable kid rock moments.

For a lot of people it’s the final jumping off point to Europe, but for a lot more people it’s home. I’ve done a couple month-long stints here myself when I needed to lie low.
