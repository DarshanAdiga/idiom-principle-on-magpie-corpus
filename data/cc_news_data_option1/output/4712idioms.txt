 Jetman Dubai's carbon-fiber wingsuit is powered by four mini jet engines, and the team's engineers were able to create a manually controlled thrust vectoring nozzle that allows pilots "to control rotations around the yaw axis at zero speeds."
 The yaw axis is perpendicular to the wings and allows the pilot to turn left and right while flying horizontally.
 Pilots can hover, stop, turn and maneuver, even performing rolls and loops.
 The suit has a maximum altitude of 6,100 meters (20,000 feet), according to the Jetman Dubai website, a maximum flight duration of 13 minutes and a top speed of 220 knots (253 miles per hour).
 In 2015, Reffet and fellow pilot Yves Rossy flew alongside the world's largest passenger jet, an Airbus A380, over Dubai.

Westgate High School’s regular season home finale Friday against Carencro will feature two of the top teams in Class 4A by any metric.
 Carencro (6-1 overall, 2-1 District 5-4A) is ranked third in the latest Class 4A poll conducted by the Louisiana Sports Writers Association, and Westgate (5-2, 2-1) is No. 10. Carencro is second in the latest unofficial Class 4A non-select power rankings at both MaxPreps.com and GeauxPreps.com, while Westgate is sixth according to Max Preps and 11th according to Geaux Preps. Each has only one loss in district, to 7-0 St. Thomas More, which is ranked No. 1 in the Class 4A statewide LSWA poll and is ranked first in the Max Preps Division II select school power rankings and second in the Geaux Preps Division II power rankings. The LHSAA did not release its rankings before deadline for today's newspaper.
 Westgate head football coach Ryan Antoine knows the Tigers face a strong challenge from the Golden Bears.
 “It’s a playoff-style game, a playoff atmosphere,” Antoine said. “We may see them later on down the line in the playoffs. They’re definitely one of the top teams in the state. We consider ourselves one of the top teams in the state in 4A as well. We feel it will be a great matchup to see where we are heading into the playoffs.”
 Westgate overwhelmed Northside this past week, 55-0, but still didn’t play at a peak, Antoine said.
 “I still don’t think we played our best game yet,” Antoine said. “We limited our penalties and scored however many times we scored, but I still think we came out flat. We had two chances in the red zone at the beginning of the game and we didn’t get in the end zone on the fourth down, and on the next drive we fumbled the snap. I was kind of disappointed with that.”
 But the defense played well, and so did the special teams.
 “We’ve just got to be able to put teams down early and when we have those chances we have to be able to capitalize on that,” he said. “I was pleased with the way we played. We played hard, but I still don’t think we’re playing at the level we’re capable of.”
 The Bears run a veer offense, one of only a couple of teams in Acadiana that does so, along with Acadiana High School, which presents challenges to any defense, Antoine said.
 “They run it well,” he said. “They’ve got a huge offensive line and they have a huge running back that runs well. The quarterback does a good job of managing. They have another good back as well that runs the ball well.
 “You’ve got to be physical and match their physicality to be able to stop those guys from scoring every series on you. We’re going to have to go out there and play one of our better games defensively to have a chance, for sure.”
 UL Lafayette commit Kendrell Williams (5-foot-11, 210 pounds) leads the veer running attack for the Bears, joined by Traylon Prejean.
 “You don’t see it around here, except for Acadiana and now Carencro,” Antoine said of the veer. “It’s hard to simulate in practice. It’s just something that we’ve got to be disciplined, we’ve got to be focused, and we’ve definitely got to be physical.
 “We’ve got to be able to read our keys and fly around, and when we’ve got the opportunity to make plays, we’ve got to make them.”
 Offensively the Tigers will have to execute and get points every chance they have to score, he said.
 “Definitely don’t turn the ball over and limit their (possessions) as much as possible,” Antoine said. “We have a young defense, so leaving those guys on the field to play a lot of downs could hurt us. Offense has to be our best defense Friday.”
 Antoine said defensive lineman Bradley Lewis has been playing well.
 “He’s been working hard, a kid who’s just getting better every week, a kid that’s starting to make a lot of plays for us, and we’ve been able to count on him a lot,” the coach said. “Definitely the most improved player we’ve got right now on defense.”
 Linebacker Henry Binion also has been playing well, Antoine said. Both he and Lewis are juniors.
 “He was one of our JV guys to start the year off, but now he’s assumed a role as a starter, and is playing real well for us right now,” Antoine said. “He’s a guy we’re starting to count on.”
 Kickoff Friday is scheduled for 7 p.m.

The big game this week that really stumped the experts was Green Bay and Indianapolis. On paper this really shouldn’t be that difficult. The Packers are 7-2, they’re cruising to winning the NFC North with little resistance, but dig a little deeper and there’s cause for concern. This team has had a really soft schedule so far, and still dropped a game to the Vikings and struggled to put away Jacksonville last week. That doesn’t inspire a ton of confidence.

It is what Warnock does. He took over the side in 21st in the Championship in June with eight games to go, took them to safety, and is now taking them up the table.
 One thing that drives him is proving people wrong, another is working with players on the training pitch to get the best out of them.
 "When I came into the club there were two or three players who, after a couple of weeks of training, I thought I'd have to get rid of - they're no good," he says. "But they're my best players now!
 "That's what I enjoy in management. When I see players change so much in the space of a few months. And they'll keep it now, they never go backwards because the things they've learned now will always be with them. When I do retire that's one of the things I'll look back at with a lot of pride."
 It was the promise of one more big challenge that lured Warnock out of another retirement earlier this year, and also the chance to work with Middlesbrough chairman Steve Gibson.
 "I never would have come back for anyone else," he says. "He rang me and asked if I could come and help out. I asked when and he said 'now'. I told him I needed to speak to my wife first! But she was really supportive, and I got in the car straight away.
 "I had talked to Steve over the last 20 years and often told him what he was missing! But we had never really got together. I wanted to show him what kind of manager I am, and I love working for him.
 "I don't have to worry about getting the sack, either. Because if we didn't do well then we would jut call it a day. I like to think we are more friends than chairman and manager, and that doesn't often happen in your career. He just lets me get on with it, and is probably quite happy that I haven't spent much! I don't moan much either - only occasionally."

But one difficulty with vaccine transport is that airplanes can only carry a limited amount of dry ice - frozen carbon dioxide - as it turns into gas over time, displacing the breathable air in the cabin.
 All widebody planes can carry a maximum of around 1 tonne of dry ice in refrigerated and insulated containers, according to a DHL white paper on vaccine transport.
 "Depending on the type of aircraft, there are usually not more than a few containers on board at the same time," said Joachim von Winning, chief executive of Air Cargo Community Frankfurt.
 For an alternative, Deutsche Post AG's DHL has been using Cyroport's capsule containers, which use liquid nitrogen to keep goods as cool as -150C for up to 10 days to support clinical vaccine trials, said Patricia Cole, DHL Global Forwarding's global head of temperature management solutions.
 Although it is relatively a small-scale solution, with only hundreds of vials in each container, broader preparations have already begun.
 Pfizer, which is working with DHL, FedEx Corp and United Parcel Service Inc for vaccine distribution in the United States, said on Monday it has launched a pilot delivery programme in four states to help it refine its nationwide and global shipping plan.
 The U.S. drugmaker has also developed temperature-controlled and GPS-enabled boxes that use dry ice to keep its vaccine at around -70C for up to 10 days.
 But cold-chain solutions providers such as Sweden's Envirotainer say so-called active containers, which use electric motors to cool their contents, are safer and more cost-effective.
 A Envirotainer spokesman said that its fleet of active temperature-controlled containers was twice that of its competitors and that it was preparing to increase its capacity by 50per cent.
 Va-Q-tec also said this month that it would significantly expand its container fleet over the coming months in anticipation of orders COVID-19 vaccine transport.
 Airlines have become more reliant on cargo for revenue this year as passenger numbers plunged amid pandemic-related travel restrictions.
 Accenture's Seabury Consulting estimates the global roll-out of a vaccine will generate 65,000 tonnes of air freight, which is five times the air vaccine trade in 2019.
 But airlines think the potential for the vaccine to allow a return to normal travel is most important, KLM chief executive Pieter Elbers said at a CAPA Centre for Aviation event on Nov. 11.
 "I think overall for the entire industry, the vaccine is going to be much more important than the cargo revenues it would bring," he said.

One of the key driver for all-in-one modular data center is its high speed of deployment. The increasing need from businesses requires the quick deployment of data centers. Since all-in-one modular data center are a complete physical infrastructure solution, it significantly reduces the deployment time as compared to a traditional data center or server room installation. The all-in- one modular data center eliminate the time required for design, specifications, procurement, integration of disparate components, and others. The speed of deployment depends on the standardization of all-in-one modular data center. The more standardized the data center, the more likely it is to be a stocked item.

Since then, crime has risen sharply, exacerbating longstanding fault lines between community activists and elected officials. Memories are still fresh from summer protests that at times spun out of control and resulted in the takeover of a police precinct, fires and widespread looting. Residents are still blocking police from entering the intersection where Mr. Floyd was killed, an area covered with flowers, murals and messages spray-painted on streets.
 So far this year, there have been 73 murders in Minneapolis and 3,425 car thefts, compared with 48 murders and 2,873 car thefts for all of 2019.
 As violent crime spreads, the defund message is now viewed as a mistake by many, including those who want to see changes to policing.
 “It was a catastrophe,” said Nekima Levy Armstrong, a civil-rights activist and lawyer in Minneapolis. She criticized city-council members for failing to engage with the Black community. “Within the Black community, we don’t have a rallying cry, per se, for no police,” she said.
 Ms. Levy Armstrong said she supports shifting some resources from police to social services. “We spend far too much on law enforcement and criminal justice, without adequate accountability,” she said.

Suresh: Yes, certainly. So what happened was our company found a very big implementation, a tech implementation, a software implementation contract with IBM and the contract was structured in a way that it was IBM’s responsibility to staff the resource needed and get the work delivered, in that sense our company had no decision or say in the hiring of contractors, it was totally IBM’s responsibility. So IBM brought in over a dozen contractors into our office, and instantly all of them were sitting on my floor where I used to sit, not too far from my sitting area, and what I noticed was in the break room, we had quite a big break room, where you could go for coffee, snacks, tea and whatnot, and these six or seven of them they would congregate in the break room when they were getting coffee and they would make all these casteist jibes on lower castes or Dalits. I was shocked to hear that and they would speak in Hindi and they would be loud, and oblivious to the other folks in the room and some of them were Indians as well, like myself. They would go about making these casteist jibes and remarks on Dalits without any sense of morality or any sense of shame. They would talk about their Brahmin identity, and they would start by making comments like, ‘oh I am Saraswat Brahmin’ and then somebody would say ‘yea I am an Iyer’ and they would talk about their sub-castes and sub-lineages within Brahmin,s which to me was quite amusing to hear them say that while they would talk about projects. What was shocking was they would then talk about Dalits and say ‘you know what this is good that we only have Brahmins in in this project, we don’t have Dalits here.’ They would say ‘yup, they just belong in our offices back home, they shouldn’t come here.’ They would be so loud when they made these statements it was quite shocking to hear what they said. What I realised was that a company like IBM, a large multi-national company, has then failed to institute policies and procedures to ensure that their employees are firm on the principle of equality, human dignity and do not practice such kind of casteism any sort of inequality or injustice around their peers. When they would make comments like only Brahmins are staffing this project, that was clear to me that they were either trying to systematically shut down a Dalit or they had already shut down a Dalit from working on this project which is quite prestigious for IBM, and also for all the professionals who were going to work on that, it had very high visibility and they would get to work on some of the most fantastic technologies. That is what I saw and heard in my own office.

“In Minnesota, Black Lives Matter was on the ballot, George Floyd was on the ballot, and racial justice was on the ballot,” Omar spokesman Jeremy Slevin said in a written statement. “As a result we saw record turnout, a swing toward Democrats and gains in the suburbs. The lesson here is that we should not shy away from talking about these issues.”
 In 2016, fewer than 4 percentage points separated Mrs. Clinton and then-Rep. Keith Ellison, a Democrat who is now the state’s attorney general, in the district. In both that election and this year’s contest there were three names on the ballot. In 2020, a year where turnout was up, Ms. Omar received about 6,000 more votes than Mr. Ellison did four years earlier.
 The voting outcome in Minneapolis, a Democratic stronghold, in many ways exemplifies broader rifts within the party. The city has been a national focus of criminal-justice issues since the May 25 death of Mr. Floyd, a Black man, at the hands of police.

The Bharatiya Janata Party(BJP) has expanded its presence to over 83 per cent of polling booths in West Bengal and is relentlessly working on the ground to defeat the Mamata Banerjee-led the All India Trinamool Congress(TMC)in the upcoming assembly polls, with Amit Shah and J P Nadda galvanising the rank and file with their regular visits, party state president Dilip Ghosh said on Wednesday.The BJP has kick-started its campaign for the assembly elections slated for early next year and is challenging the Trinamool Congress at the hustings with the new slogan of "Ei baar Bangla, parle samla (Now it's Bengal's turn, hold on to it if you can)", Ghosh told PTI, referring to the recent victory of the National Democratic Alliance(NDA) in Bihar polls.In the upcoming election in West Bengal it will be a direct fight between the BJP and the TMC, he said, dubbing both the Left parties and the Congress as spent forces.Hinting at defections of TMC leaders to his party ahead of the polls, Ghosh said that even leaders of the Mamata Banerjee-led party are feeling suffocated and looking for "oxygen of freedom", whereas the BJP is a democratic party with "a number of oxygen cylinders". Ghosh said that for effective management of the party's campaign, the BJP has divided the state in five zones -- Medinipur, north Bengal, Kolkata, Nabadwip and Rahr Bongo, on the basis of local issues and their characteristics.The party has expanded its footprint in the state and now has presence in over 65,000 (or over 83 per cent) polling booths out of the total 78,000, he said. National party leaders, including J P Nadda and Amit Shah, will visit the state every month. "Amit Shah-ji is expected to visit the state every month and his presence will boost the morale of party workers," he added. Though the BJP has a marginal presence in the Assembly, it has emerged as the main challenger to the TMC in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, pushing aside the Left parties and the Congress. It won 18 of the 42 Lok Sabha seats in the state, only four less that the TMC's 22. The party has now focused on winning the state from the TMC. Election to the 294-member state assembly is scheduled to be held in the first half of 2021.

Suresh: Sure, as you had started off saying earlier that we have a huge Indian diaspora. A lot of that is made up of these dominant castes or caste Hindus in the US. Now what happened with me was a lot of my friends or folks that I used to meet and hang out with many of them were from upper-caste communities and not that they would bring up these conversations or discussions with me but one time there this one incident where a casteist slur used and I then had to do a sort of course on caste for them. So what happened was we were all sitting together in a room, it was a weekend, it was Friday night and there were a bunch of us about seven or eight of us, we had just finished dinner and then one of our friends showed up and when that friend showed up he was just taking his shoes off to come to the carpet in the living room and this one particular friend looked at the friend who had just come into the room and said ‘hey look at the way you are dressed, are you bhangi or what’, at that point when I heard that from my friend I was shocked because I had known this guy for a few years I had known him to be a very nice and kind person who wasn’t casteist, to say the least at least I had not experienced that. So when he said that ‘bhangi hai kya’ in Hindi what he basically meant was ‘why you dress up like a bhangi’ that slur was very offensive and almost cruel so at that point, I decided again that its time to now essentially educate my friend and make the other friends realise what was said was wrong because all the other friends in the room just laughed it off casually and they said ‘oh look at the way you are dressed’. So then I said you know ‘why are you calling him a bhangi. What’s wrong with that?.’ Then he said it’s not like you are one, and then I said ‘okay look I am a Dalit’ and when I said that he instantly got shocked and he had a lot of remorse and with that expression, he said ‘oh I am so sorry’ and I said, ‘that’s okay just hear me out now’ so then I told him ‘when you use these words for anybody who is a Dalit who is listening to you are essentially making them relive the history of historical injustices of the past what went on for two-three millennia’ then I told them how caste system was developed, how Manusmiriti came into the picture and how these casteist institutions shed down opportunities, have discriminated, have killed, have murdered, have raped, have butchered and denied opportunities for all these centuries and then I told my friends ‘when you say these things it is a trigger, it is a trigger for all of those incidents for any Dalit and it can be traumatizing for some of them, it can make someone get really angry, upset or all of these feelings. So when you say these things you are perpetuating this horrible, unequal injustice and the system. Then I gave them some parallels with the Jim Crow laws here in the US, the African American struggle and the racism in the US. So they, at least this friend who made this slur, this casteist slur, the bhangi slur, he understood it, the other friends they said ‘oh wow we didn’t know’ which I felt they almost gave lip service to that, they were disinterested in that or maybe in their mind they agreed to the bhangi slur but they didn’t say explicitly to me but when my friend when he said that and I told him all of this, and gave him almost like a lecture, he said ‘hey thanks for educating me, I am really sorry’ and he apologised and that was that. And after that, I didn’t notice any particular changes in that person or his behaviour towards me or his outlook in general so we stayed still stayed friends and he believes in the Dalit cause.

LONDON - RSA Insurance, one of the U.K.'s oldest insurance companies, agreed Wednesday to a takeover by Canadian and Danish buyers in a cash deal that values it at 7.2 billion pounds (US$9.4 billion).
 Canada's Intact Financial Corp. and Denmark's Tryg said their offer of 685 pence per share represents a 51 per cent premium on RSA's share price on Nov. 4, the day before the announcement of a possible offer.
 Intact CEO Charles Brindamour called the acquisition highly strategic.
 "It expands our leadership position in Canada, builds on our strong track record in specialty lines, and puts us in a solid position to strengthen RSA's UK and Ireland operations," Brindamour said in a statement.
 "We have strong capabilities in data, risk-selection and claims management, which we plan to leverage across the business."
 Under the terms of the deal, Tryg will pay 4.2 billion pounds to take over RSA’s Swedish and Norwegian businesses, while Intact will pay 3 billion to buy RSA’s operations in Canada, the U.K., Ireland and other international locations. The two companies will co-own RSA’s Danish business.

The transition time between one presidential administration and the next is always frenetic, fast-paced and full of some uncertainty as campaigns try to morph into governments. Doing it during a surging pandemic and an economic downturn makes it even more important to hand things over the right way.
 President Donald Trump on one hand blocking President-elect Joe Biden and on the other not seeming to do much actual presidential work is not the right way.
 There is plenty of alarm about Trump's functional denial of his election loss. And many experts are raising serious concerns about what Biden's team is missing out on -- briefings, payroll, office space and more -- as it waits for frivolous lawsuits to be dismissed and for Trump to come to terms with his stinging defeat.

So we went from having an exchange to having an altercation - he tried to badmouth me, he tried to abuse me - and I said just stop right here, I am not going to have any of this, this is not your village, which your ancestors dominate, this is the United States, if you go further I want you to know that this university has a strong commitment to equity and diversity, and if you say anything further this matter will go to the university administration, so he at that point, did not realise that I was telling him to stop, but he was so angry and it felt like his casteist ego was so bruised. For him it was like ‘how dare you Dalit challenge me?’ so this Master’s guy told him ‘hey, you need to stop, this may go to university authorities and we don’t want that’. So he essentially grabbed this PhD guy out of the room and with them all other Indian students as well. The other Indian students, when I told them I am Dalit they all looked at me as if they were not expecting it, they were all shocked as well so a bunch of them exited the room and I was just standing there finishing up my work. And then there were two other students who were standing in the room listening to all this quietly, they did not say a word, they did not bat an eyelid, they did not react. Then they came up to me and said ‘hey brother, that was brave but you shouldn’t have done that’. So I said, ‘okay, you called me brother, are you guys Dalits too?’ because the way they approached me, the way they were talking to me I had a sense that they had some sense of empathy about this whole altercation that had just happened, and then they said ‘yes we are Dalits’. They happened to be from the outskirts of Hyderabad and at the time it was part of Andra Pradesh, before the state became Telangana, so they were Telugu students and they said, ‘yes we are Dalits as well’. So I asked them how come you guys were listening to all of this silently, and why didn’t you guys react? They said, ‘brother we do not want any of this, trust me, these people have a very strong circle and now that you told them you are Dalit they will ostracise you from the Indian student community’. I told them that I don’t care, you can not stay silent anymore and listen to this casteist abuse, and they said ‘yeah but you know we don’t want this, we avoid all of that’ and I said ‘but what are you so afraid of?’

The Bharatiya Janata Party(BJP) has expanded its presence to over 83 per cent of polling booths in West Bengal and is relentlessly working on the ground to defeat the Mamata Banerjee-led the All India Trinamool Congress(TMC)in the upcoming assembly polls, with Amit Shah and J P Nadda galvanising the rank and file with their regular visits, party state president Dilip Ghosh said on Wednesday.
 The BJP has kick-started its campaign for the assembly elections slated for early next year and is challenging the Trinamool Congress at the hustings with the new slogan of "Ei baar Bangla, parle samla (Now it's Bengal's turn, hold on to it if you can)", Ghosh told PTI, referring to the recent victory of the National Democratic Alliance(NDA) in Bihar polls.
 In the upcoming election in West Bengal it will be a direct fight between the BJP and the TMC, he said, dubbing both the Left parties and the Congress as spent forces.
 Hinting at defections of TMC leaders to his party ahead of the polls, Ghosh said that even leaders of the Mamata Banerjee-led party are feeling suffocated and looking for "oxygen of freedom", whereas the BJP is a democratic party with "a number of oxygen cylinders".
   
   
 Ghosh said that for effective management of the party's campaign, the BJP has divided the state in five zones -- Medinipur, north Bengal, Kolkata, Nabadwip and Rahr Bongo, on the basis of local issues and their characteristics.
 The party has expanded its footprint in the state and now has presence in over 65,000 (or over 83 per cent) polling booths out of the total 78,000, he said.
 National party leaders, including J P Nadda and Amit Shah, will visit the state every month. "Amit Shah-ji is expected to visit the state every month and his presence will boost the morale of party workers," he added.
 Though the BJP has a marginal presence in the Assembly, it has emerged as the main challenger to the TMC in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, pushing aside the Left parties and the Congress.
 It won 18 of the 42 Lok Sabha seats in the state, only four less that the TMC's 22.
 The party has now focused on winning the state from the TMC.
 Election to the 294-member state assembly is scheduled to be held in the first half of 2021.
