 "We need cash in the short term and we need clarity on what protocols and what mitigation measures are going to be put in place, either for incoming people from the airport, in relation to temperature controls, blood tests.

A bachelor's degree is not enough for getting a job and keeping it. The degree shows a student has the ability to study and absorb information from each class. Hopefully, the student has chosen a major, though students often change majors as they become more familiar with the field. After graduation, no one will be interviewing and testing students on what they learned in school. Experienced interviewers will judge interviewees on their maturity in providing appropriate responses to their questions. They will also pose hypothetical business situations to determine one's creative and critical thinking skills.
   
 Competition is fierce, and the days of entitlement are over, unless one's parents run a family-owned business. Even then, they may want a son or daughter to learn the business before allowing them to attain a management job.
   
 Many employees know they have to prove themselves on the job before they are trusted with more responsibility, but not all are aware of what it really takes to become valued. According to Bruce Tulgan, author of "The Art of Being Indispensable At Work" and bestselling author of "It's Okay to Be The Boss," and his three decades of following the latest developments in the workplace through long-term organizational studies, advancing in one's career results from achieving a long list of necessary employee attributes.
   
 Tulgan says go-to people in organizations make the right decisions and get things done. They routinely deliver or have great reasons if they decline work. By ruling out the work they think will not benefit the company, they build their reputation on their successes. When a person has a history of accomplishments, others want to work with them.
   
 Employees are asked to do things for their bosses, but they may also be asked to work for people who are not their bosses. It's important to work within the hierarchy both up and down the chain of command within the system. Reaching out to laterals or others across departments is not the preferred way to get things done.
   
 Becoming indispensable requires critical thinking abilities, which doesn't include saying yes habitually without analyzing the information and the situation. It's important to say no to avoid overcommitment. Saying no for the right reasons will add to your credibility. Sometimes, saying no to something is best replaced by saying "not yet." That means waiting for a better plan before going ahead. A flat no may look like one is not willing to examine all aspects of a project where there may be further opportunities. Saying no without appearing stubborn is a skill, so it is not a word to jump on without thinking.
   
 Being organized through lists and clear instructions can turn a person into a go-to contact. Lists give a person the opportunity to consider where and what to focus on to create value. They encourage a person to finish all projects they start so they can accept new ones. Accepting projects beyond what is possible may create the reverse effect. Keep in mind that according to research, no one can successfully multitask. When a project is overwhelming, break it into smaller sections to complete it without errors.
   
 Politicking will not lead a person to success. Relationship-building is important, but focusing on completing the work over brownnosing will move the person closer to success. Go-to employees connect with other go-to employees because they know the value of building relationships with others who are also focused on success.
   
 There will always be someone who achieves more than others. This is not done without a foundation based on knowledge and values. Becoming a known go-to person is a choice made on wanting to be indispensable.

The most recognizable hockey family were, of course, the Howes. Gordie Howe led a professional legacy that few will ever come close to replicating. His intense work ethic and devotion to the game was embraced by his sons. Mark, Marty, and Murray all grew up under the influence of one of the greatest names in hockey. To them, he was dad. Their hero, leader, and teacher on and off the ice. All three boys played hockey and lead lives much like their father's in one way or the other. Marty spent 22 seasons in various leagues, including 197 NHL games. Later, Marty went on to coach, finishing his hockey career in 2006 as the assistant coach with the AHL’s Chicago Wolves.

 Kerr called on companies to take urgent action to change the hiring culture in senior-level positions in the country.
 "Black livelihoods matter and employers need to take urgent action to ensure that their organisation is inclusive and a place where people of any ethnic background can thrive and succeed," Kerr said.

The Giants came into the 2020 draft with a desperate need to protect Daniel Jones' blind side, and they addressed that very well by selecting Georgia tackle Andrew Thomas with the fourth overall pick. Big Blue then stole Alabama safety Xavier McKinney, whose versatility will show up right away, in the second round. Signing former Panthers cornerback James Bradberry will help what may have been the NFL's worst cornerback group after the team released Janoris Jenkins, and Jones is starting to look like a franchise quarterback, so there are reasons to be encouraged about the team's future. Pass rush is still a problem, and Jones' receivers are underwhelming, so the hope will be that the offense can be run around Saquon Barkley for the time being.

Maintaining the same disposition on and off the ice, Lidstrom did not force his boys into the game, rather, let it develop on its own. Having found the love and the talent individually, he supports his boys the way he supported his team once upon a time; calmly.

According to figures released Monday by the Africa Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the continent now has 306,567 confirmed cases, including 8,115 deaths and 146,212 recoveries. It took more than 90 days for Africa's 54 countries to reach 100,000 cases, 19 days to reach 200,000 and now 12 days to go above 300,000. The actual number of cases is believed to be much higher, as testing across the continent is low.

Determined to get beyond Covid-19, America is rapidly opening up, but a local survivor of the disease who had a brush with death is not sure it's a good idea.  
 Having spent 27 days in the hospital, Lawrence "Larry" Davis urges people to practice social distancing, wear a mask and practice frequent washing of one's hands.  
 "There's too much even the experts do not know about this disease," Davis said.  
 Following the proper protocol of hand washing, keeping social distance, and wearing face masks helps keep Covid-19 from spreading, "and," he added, "it not only protects the person doing it, but shows respect for others with whom he interacts."  
 A 63-year-old pilot, who owns and operates Davis Aviation, an infrared observation service that frequently has him traveling, Davis had flown home from Redmond, Oregon on March 10 using a commuter to Denver where he then boarded a packed jetliner bound for Cleveland.  
 A week later, during an assignment in Cincinnati, he noticed a brief burning sensation in his lungs so severe he thought he might be having a heart attack. The burning quickly subsided.  
 He then noticed the food he was eating had no taste. Flying back to the Portage County Airport where he keeps his Cessna 182, he thought he might be coming down with the flu even though he had gotten his flu shot earlier.  
 For the next four days, Davis had a temperature of 100.5 degrees and experienced difficulty sleeping. He used Nyquil, his tried and true remedy for a bad cold. Then during a phone call with his wife, Eugenia, a diplomat with the U.S. State Department in Washington, DC, she noticed he had not been able to speak a complete sentence without drawing an extra breath.  
 "Larry," she said, "get to a hospital."  
 On March 22, he drove himself to UH Portage Medical Center and walked into the emergency room where a nasal swab test was taken that confirmed he had COVID-19. Davis said that was the last thing he remembered. He woke up several days later in ICU (Intensive Care Unit) intubated and connected to a ventilator with a feeding tube running down his nose into his stomach. A catheter was taking out his liquid wastes and a tube had been inserted through the rectum into his colon to remove solid wastes.  
 His memory of ICU is foggy. He had dreams about the people trying to help him and about speaking in French and Spanish, languages in which he is fluent. He remembers worrying about his wife who coincidentally was also diagnosed with Covid-19 in a much milder form.  
 Nurses and doctors would come in every morning to see if he remembered his name and birthdate. Nurses would urge him to quit trying to remove his breathing tube.  
 "I was not even aware I had been trying to do that," he said, but he noticed his hands had been tied to restrain them.  
 So many doctors and nurses looked after him and Davis said he cannot remember all their names, but he is grateful for them. COVID-19, he said, caused kidney malfunctioning that required him for a time to go on dialysis. A nephrologist, Dr. Mansumeet Singh, is treating him for those issues. Dr. Gregory Johnson has also been involved and Davis said he appreciates both doctors for their straight forward manner.  
 "I came close to dying and they both let me know we all need to take COVID-19 seriously," Davis said.  
 He survived, but there are others not as fortunate. At his discharge from UH Portage Medical Center, hospital employees, nurses, and doctors, accompanied him holding a clapping ceremony to celebrate his recovery. Davis was placed into an ambulance and taken to a long-term are facility in Boardman where for three days, he used a walker to regain basic mobility.  
 His wife then drove him home to Kent where he has engaged in rigorous exercise to get back his strength.  
 "I am not wealthy, but I will do anything I can to help UH Portage Medical Center," Davis said. An expert in infrared technology, he has done nocturnal flyovers of UH Portage Medical Center to inspect roofing needs. His efforts have spotted some small roof deterioration that if promptly addressed, "may save them $240,000, money that can be applied to other uses."  
 Davis said he is willing to perform the same service free of charge for all of the hospitals in the University Hospital system throughout Northeast Ohio.  
 The U.S. State Department has assigned his wife to a diplomatic position in Norway and Davis said he will soon join her. As a federal employee she has excellent healthcare insurance and Davis' medical expenses, incurred during his 27 days of hospitalization, have been covered, "but anyone without good healthcare insurance might not be so lucky."  
 He recently returned to UH Portage Medical Center to present some fine chocolates to nurses who were especially helpful.  
 "When people save your life, you do not forget," he said. "I know I will remember them the rest of my life."  
 He also appreciates the work of the Ohio Health Department, which until last week, was headed up by Dr. Amy Acton. The department, while Davis was ill, was in contact with UH Portage Medical Center and with his wife, Eugenia, in Washington, DC, assiduously tracing his travels prior to his bout with COVID-19 to identify how the disease was passed to him.  
 Recently, when he and Eugenia stopped at the Portage County Airport so he could fly his Cessna, an acquaintance approached Davis and indicated he thought the threat posed by COVID- 19 might be overblown.  
 "I told him of my experience and assured him it is not," Davis said.
