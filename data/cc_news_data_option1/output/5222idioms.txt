Loneliness is within my top three minimum favorite emotions that are human. I might instead be just about anything than lonely. Yet, whenever searching straight right right back inside my wedding, I became very lonely then aswell. Loneliness is sold with the territory of walking this Earth, irrespective of your marital status. You can look at to numb it or ignore it, then again it will probably emerge as an alternate feeling at a improper time. So, we find just sitting along with it is better. Acknowledge that is just what you are feeling. Ask Jesus to meet up you inside it. And either just sit in it quietly, decide to make a move to occupy your thoughts, or meet up with a pal. But realize that it is the main package. It does not destroy you, and it'll sweep straight back away just as it swept in.

Nobody would like to acknowledge that she or he ended up being wrong, particularly in a married relationship where things finished due to the other partner's infidelity, addiction, or punishment. It really is easier and easier to aim the little finger at our mate, but it is perhaps maybe not practical to trust that individuals had been blameless. Do not get me personally incorrect: if for example the partner was unfaithful, had an addiction, or ended up being abusive to you personally, you failed to cause it, you can not get a handle on it, and you also cannot cure it, to borrow knowledge from data recovery programs. Nevertheless, there have been things you can have inked differently or better, even though it's painful to acknowledge. You may expect your recovery to thrive when you have owned your component into the demise of one's wedding.

A day after Congress president Sonia Gandhi wrote to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray asking him to fulfil promises made to socially backward classes, the unease between Congress and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) was visible even as the Congress insisted that Gandhi's letter should be seen as dialogue and not confrontation. On the other hand, Congress on Saturday launched an attack against the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), accusing the party of working against the interests of backward classes. Significantly, the three ruling partners, Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress, have decided to contest elections to gram panchayats in January separately, although Thackeray had earlier announced that the ruling Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) will contest all local polls together as a coalition.
 The letter from Gandhi, which made the fissures in MVA visible, came at a time when there is unease in the Congress over the way the government is being run. Most Congress leaders in the state think that the government is being run by Thackeray and NCP chief Sharad Pawar, and that Congress doesn't have any scope to decide policies of the government.
 Congress leaders in the past have expressed unhappiness over the lack of funds provided to local bodies controlled by the Congress.
 More recently, energy minister Nitin Raut's proposal to provide relief to consumers on inflated electricity bills was shot down by the finance department headed by deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar as the state's financial condition was precarious to allow to let go of ₹60,000 crore in pending bills.
 A senior Congress leader said, "For the past few months, our ministers such as Ashok Chavan and Vijay Vadettiwar have publicly expressed unhappiness over funding of certain schemes or plans or even local bodies where our party is in power." He added, "It is no coincidence that the state finance department is headed by NCP's Ajit Pawar."
 NCP minister and spokesperson Nawab Malik said the letter could be the outcome of a lack of communication within the party or differences between its leaders in the state.
 "The functioning of various programmes and schemes of the government is interrupted due to the pandemic and lockdown, which has adversely affected state's revenue. Its two senior ministers in the government know it. Besides, the tribal development department is headed by a Congress minister. The party's leaders should have asked the minister what is the reality," said Malik.
 State Congress chief Balasaheb Thorat on Saturday dismissed the opposition's criticism that Gandhi's letter indicated that all was not well with the government and it is dysfunctional. Thorat, the revenue minister in the Sena- led MVA government, said that the letter was a dialogue and not a sign of resentment. He also said the Congress would consider the opinion of Ajit Pawar, who is NCP representative in MVA's coordination committee, and not Malik's.
 While Thackeray has not reacted to the letter yet, Sena has welcomed the same and said that the points in the CMP (common minimum programme) will be implemented gradually in the coming year of the government.
 Thorat said, "Congress's stand has always been in favour of the upliftment of the poor and deprived sections of the society and Gandhi's letter was part of a dialogue on how welfare measures can be taken. There is no resentment,'' he said. ''A CMP for the welfare of different sections of the society is the agenda of the MVA and Uddhav Thackeray is working in that direction. Some issues might have gone on the back-burner due to the pandemic. But the government is slowly getting back on track and focusing on the CMP,'' Thorat added.
 Sena chief spokesperson Sanjay Raut denied that there is any "pressure politics" by the Congress on the MVA government as the media is speculating. Speaking to reporters on Saturday in Mumbai, Raut said, "If the Congress party has brought forward an agenda, which is in the interest of people of Maharashtra and the state, then it should be welcomed. There are no pressure politics."
 Meanwhile, the MVA allies, who tasted electoral success in the recently held legislative council elections, are not going to contest the upcoming elections of 14,234 gram pachayats in an alliance. Thackeray had said that the three parties will contest all local body elections in an alliance, but on Saturday, the Sena boss told party functionaries that the party will put candidates in almost all the gram panchayats and asked them to win maximum gram panchayats. A similar stand to bag most gram panchayat seats was taken by Thorat, while NCP state president Jayant Patil said the party never gives ticket to candidates, indicating that there will be no alliance.
 The gram panchayat elections are slated for January 15, and all the four political parties are gearing up for the local polls to see their individual strength and acceptability after the shift in the political dynamic that happened in November 2019 with the formation of MVA. Of the over 28,000 gram panchayats, elections to 14,234 of them in 34 districts were announced by the State Election Commission last week.
 The gram panchayat elections are not fought on party symbol but by forming a panel at the local level.
 "We are going to ensure that Congress controls most number of gram panchayat and we are confident that the Congress will get big success at the gram panchayat level," Thorat said in a statement. Patil, meanwhile, said, "No party, and particularly NCP, does not contest gram panchayat on a party ticket and therefore parties contesting gram panchayat polls does not arise."
 Thackeray has been holding meeting with party functionaries for the past three days over the preparation for the polls. He met with Sena district presidents and directed them to win maximum number of gram panchayats. At a meeting with deputy leaders and sampark pramukhs of the party held on Saturday at his official resident Varsha, Thackeray told them to take the work carried out by the Uddhav Thackeray-led government to the people in villages.
 A senior functionary, who was present in the meeting said, "Uddhav ji has said that the party will put up candidates on mostly all 14,000 odd gram panchayat. His instructions to all district president and contact heads was to convey work done by government during Nisarg cyclone and other natural calamities that struck the state. He has directed us to win maximum gram panchayats."
 Meanwhile, addressing a press conference in Nagpur, state energy minister and chairman of AICC SC cell,, Nitin Raut insisted that the Congress president's letter was indication of the party's social agenda. He said Gandhi's "revolutionary letter" will act as the guiding factor for the welfare of SC/ST communities and other backward classes under the CMP of the ruling alliance in the state.
 Raut trained guns at the BJP government in the Centres and the previous state government and said, "BJP governments in state and at the Centre have been conspiring to deny chances to backward classes in jobs and self employment."
 He further added, "The road to progress of SC/ST and backward classes was hindered by the BJP. When the Dalit and backward classes became IAS and IFS officers, and came at par with them, they disliked it. When they became business-owners they did not like it. The Central government conducted direct recruitment of officers at joint secretary level. You will not find one person from backward classes."

The next journey was on a road that kept turning narrower, bumpy and rough. Mounting over mountains, it kept taking steep curves. Trees, countless in number, lay cut all along the way as if sacrificed for the Mughal Road. Mountains, too, appeared wounded, carved out for roads. Peering out from the window seat, I noticed the steepness below that is more than enough to scare you but then the excitement defeats it. And every single turn provides you with a magnificently splendid view. Then the roads become rocky, and bulldozers become a common sight busy clearing the roads of the landslides that damage them every winter. Expanses of moraines dot the roads at regular intervals below the snowbound areas, where once moved mighty glaciers. One doesn’t notice the altitude change so much but the trail climbs gradually the whole way. You will notice that the trees have begun to disappear, giving way to meadows.

Here the culture, the dialect, the way of living was unique. People were so loving and cooperating, humble, submissive and supportive. I for the first time was in a place which was totally strange for me. But I felt more comfort here than at my native place. Such was the nature of people here. No one even liked to fence their premises. The infrastructure was so well-off that even the outer-rung of the village possessed a pucca house. Many of the nomads themselves had opened shops to earn a living, selling all kinds of stuff from plastic-packaged items to cigarettes, beedis and tobacco. Even Lipton Tea prepared on LPG – a must at that altitude. Still, thousands of people come only to adulterate it; snack-packs lay here and there, plastic rags all over the place. Setting a few ‘Use Me’ dustbins will work wonders. The waste can later be collected to be decomposed at some faraway place. “Namkeen chai” in a clay cup with sattu was the specialty here.

Chandigarh (Punjab) [India], December 19 (ANI): Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Saturday accused the central government of using "intimidatory tactics" against the "arhtiyas" supporting the agitating farmers and said it was indulging "vendetta politics".
 According to an official release, the Chief Minister termed the income tax raids against some "arhtiyas" as an obvious pressure tactic to curb their democratic rights.
 It said that 14 "arhtiyas" across Punjab received notices from the IT department, including Vijay Kalra (President, Punjab Arthiya Association), Pawan Kumar Goyal (President, Samana Mandi) and Jaswinder Singh Rana (Patiala district President).
 "It is evident that having failed to persuade, mislead and divide the farmers into ending their prolonged protest, the central government is now trying to weaken their struggle by targeting the arhtiyas (middleman) who have been actively supporting the agitation since day one," he said.
 He noted that IT raids were conducted at the premises of several big "arhtiyas" of Punjab within a span of just four days of issuing notices without waiting for responses to the notices.
 "This is a clear debasement of the due process of law. Even the local police were not informed or taken into confidence, as is the normal procedure, and instead, the CRPF was used to provide security during the raids by the I-T teams," he added.
 "What is this if not a clear case of vendetta politics by the Centre which is hell-bent on demolishing the farmers' protest by hook or by crook?" the Chief Minister asked.
 Noting that this was not the first instance of misuse of a central agency by the central government Singh said, "these bullying actions of the government do not augur well for the world's largest democracy."
 "Even the Supreme Court has upheld the peoples' right to protest peacefully. The central government's actions amount to gross violation of the apex court's directions and the spirit of the Constitution," he added.
 The Chief Minister reiterated his appeal to the central government not to stand on ego but to start a meaningful dialogue with the farmers and other stakeholders. (ANI)

Many other architectural and cultural marvels peculiar to Kashmir are still fresh in our memory. It is our pious duty to preserve them and keep them for posterity. In some villages the roofs of the larger houses and the shrines (ziarats) were made of birch bark with a layer of earth above it. This formed an excellent roof and in the spring the housetops were covered with different kinds of beautiful flowers and grass, providing a panoramic view and food for thought for artists, writers and poets. Such verdant roofing was in vogue in cities also and some of them may still be existing. I also remember seeing such houses in interior Habba Kadal and elsewhere in Srinagar city .The roofs of houses were also made of wooden shingles and the houses itself were made of wooden logs built by laying them one upon another and then axe-cut planks fitted into the grooved beams. At some far-off places, mud houses with thatched roofs are still found. Mud is a bad conductor of heat and so is the air trapped in the thatch of the roof. Thus, in summer the heat from outside does not flow in and the house keeps cool. Conversely, in winter the heat from within does not flow out and it keeps warm.
