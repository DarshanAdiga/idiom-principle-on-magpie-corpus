UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) — Germany accused Russia and China on Tuesday of preventing a United Nations Security Council committee from determining whether North Korea has breached a U.N. cap on refined petroleum imports by the isolated Asian state.
 The Security Council has ratcheted up sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in a bid to choke funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs. In 2017 it imposed an annual cap of 500,000 barrels on refined petroleum imports.
 China and Russia are the only countries to have notified the Security Council's North Korea sanctions committee of refined petroleum exports to Pyongyang, but they did so in tons instead of barrels and the committee has been unable to agree on a conversion rate so it can determine when the cap was reached.
 "Despite numerous attempts – the issue has been on the agenda for no less than three years – to find an agreement on a conversion rate, Russia and China have been stalling the process," German U.N. Ambassador Christoph Heusgen, chairman of the sanctions committee, told reporters.
 "While this shouldn't be a complicated matter to solve, it has become clear that the two delegations are politicizing this topic," Heusgen said, after raising the issue behind closed doors in a formal Security Council meeting.
 The Russian mission to the United Nations did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
 A spokesperson for China's U.N. mission said the U.N. resolution imposing the refined petroleum cap does not specify what unit of measurement should be used and that negotiations on a conversion rate involve "complicated technical issues" and "it's normal that relevant parties have differences."
 The spokesperson accused Germany of misusing its position as chair of the sanctions committee "by continuously interrupting the ongoing in-depth exchange among relevant parties on this issue," adding that such moves "will never bring the committee any closer to an agreement."
 For the past three years, the United States and dozens of allies have accused North Korea of breaching the fuel cap through illicit imports and called for an immediate halt to all deliveries. However, Russia and China repeatedly prevented the sanctions committee from issuing such a statement.
 The North Korean mission to the United Nations in New York has not responded to the accusations.

To understand the relationship between viral loads and death, the UW team analyzed data from UW Medicine’s Northwest campus. For 109 patients admitted to the hospital, the odds of dying within a month of their initial positive test was 4.2 times higher for patients who had high viral loads on admission compared to patients who had low viral loads.
 Knowing that threshold might help doctors determine when patients are out of the woods, said Bryan.
 “One of the tricky things about COVID-19 is that early on, patients might seem to be doing fine and could be discharged, only to be readmitted later.”
 It’s not clear why viral loads vary so widely among people infected with the novel coronavirus. “It’s the difference between a drop or an ocean,” Greninger said. “And we’re not taking that into consideration.”
 Weak immune systems probably allow the virus to flourish. And how much virus a person was initially exposed to might be important, but that’s still not clear, he added.
 The researchers also found patients whose bodies had already started producing antibodies against the novel coronavirus by the time they were admitted were about half as likely to die as patients without antibodies — though because of the small numbers of those patients, the results were not statistically significant.

MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Prosecutors in the upcoming trial of a former Minneapolis police officer charged with killing George Floyd want to introduce evidence of a 2017 arrest in which they say the officer held his knee on the back of a 14-year-old boy and ignored his pleas that he couldn’t breathe. Prosecutors say body camera video that captured the boy’s arrest shows that Derek Chauvin uses unreasonable force when dealing with a suspect who doesn't immediate comply with his orders. Chauvin’s attorney argues that the force used was in keeping a former department policy. Floyd, a Black man who was handcuffed, died in May after Chauvin, who is white, pressed his knee against Floyd’s neck for several minutes while Floyd said he couldn’t breathe.
