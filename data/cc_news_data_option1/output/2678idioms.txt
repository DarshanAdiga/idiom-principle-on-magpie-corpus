INDIANAPOLIS — An Indiana law violates the U.S. Constitution by blocking voters and candidates from asking courts to keep polling places open longer because of Election Day troubles, a voting rights group argued in a lawsuit filed Thursday.
 The law passed by Indiana's Republican-dominated Legislature in 2019 prevents anyone other than a county election board from requesting court orders extending voting hours.
 The lawsuit filed in federal court in Indianapolis on behalf of Common Cause Indiana cites equipment troubles, delays in opening polling sites or ballot shortages during the November 2018 elections in Johnson, Porter and Monroe counties. It argues the state law wrongly thwarts voters and political parties from protecting the right to vote.

Adds Color of Change reaction, Facebook pledge to hire civil rights leader)
 By Supantha Mukherjee and Elizabeth Culliford
 July 8 (Reuters) - Facebook Inc's decisions to allow controversial posts by President Donald Trump established a "terrible precedent" that could allow the platform to be "weaponized to suppress voting," an external civil rights audit found on Wednesday.
 The report, which Facebook commissioned two years ago, said the social network has not done enough to protect users from discrimination, falsehoods and incitement to violence, adding to pressure on the company in the midst of an advertiser boycott.
 The findings come as more than 900 advertisers, including major brands such as Coca-Cola Co and Unilever Plc , have joined a boycott started by major U.S. civil rights groups, including the Anti-Defamation League and the NAACP, to pressure Facebook to take concrete steps to block hate speech.
 "Many in the civil rights community have become disheartened, frustrated and angry after years of engagement where they implored the company to do more to advance equality and fight discrimination, while also safeguarding free expression," the auditors wrote.
 Facebook has taken a hands-off approach to political speech compared to rivals, notably leaving untouched posts by Trump in recent weeks which were flagged by its rival Twitter Inc for falsehoods and incitement of violence.
 One Trump tweet, labeled by Twitter as violating its policy against "glorifying violence," said: "Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts."
 The auditors expressed "significant concern" about the company's steadfast commitment to protect a particular definition of free expression, even where that has meant allowing harmful and divisive rhetoric that amplifies hate speech and threatens civil rights.
 By declining to hold politicians to the same rules as everyone else, Facebook created a "hierarchy of speech" that "privileges certain voices" over others, they wrote.
 Racial justice group Color Of Change, which pushed for Facebook to have an audit and helped organize the advertising boycott, said the report correctly assessed the company's approach as "incremental and counterproductive."
 Muslim Advocates, which also pushed for the audit, said Wednesday it confirmed Facebook enables anti-Muslim violence.
 Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg defended Facebook's policy of not fact- checking political ads in a speech at Georgetown University last year where he cited protests against the Vietnam War.
 "Allowing the Trump posts to remain establishes a terrible precedent that may lead other politicians and non-politicians to spread false information about legal voting methods, which would effectively allow the platform to be weaponized to suppress voting," the auditors said.
 Facebook commissioned the audit in 2018 as part of its response to a range of criticism over issues such as data privacy, voter suppression, incitement of violence and a lack of transparency in political advertising. The audit was led by Laura Murphy, a former director of the American Civil Liberties Union's legislative office.
 The company did not immediately indicate specific steps it would take in response to the findings but issued a statement attributed to Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg describing the audit as a "really important process for our company."
 "The audit looked at a wide range of civil rights issues, including our policies against hate. There are no quick fixes to these issues — nor should there be," Sandberg said. "What has become increasingly clear is that we have a long way to go."
 She said Facebook would hire a civil rights leader, as previously discussed with ad boycott leaders, but stopped short of their demand that the role be an executive-level position.
 Organizers of the advertising boycott met for more than an hour via video conference with Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Sandberg on Tuesday. After the meeting, activists said they saw "no commitment to action" from the company.

To ensure that there is no reverse flow in Badshahpur drain at Khandsa during the monsoon and to prevent any accident along a 30-meter sretch which is still incomplete, the Haryana Shahri Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP) has built a wall along the stretch on both sides.
 HSVP constructed the 28-km long Badshahpur drain as a box-type concrete structure to prevent waterlogging. However, a 30 metre stretch in the Khandsa village could not be built due to legal dispute over acquisition of some land.
 On June 20, when they had inspected the area, officials said they found iron bars were protruding out from the under-construction drain that posed a threat to anyone walking alongside it.
 "The work on the walls started on June 23 and it has been completed. This safety wall will ensure that water does not get collected there and prevent people or vehicles accidentally falling into the drain during rains," said Jitender Yadav, administrator, HSVP.
 The Badshahpur drain originates from Ghata village and brings monsoon water that collects at the Ghata dam to the Najafgarh drain passing through the city.
 To ensure that the water does not flow back and flood the Hero Honda Chowk, officials said that a pump with high capacity was installed at the location to ensure that the water flowed towards the Najafgarh drain. In 2018, Hero Honda Chowk underpass was submerged after the drain at Khandsa started flowing the other way forcing road closure for four days.
 In a recent stock taking meeting of different civic agencies, Vinay Pratap Singh, commissioner, MCG, Gurugram also said that heavy water pumps have been installed at this and several other locations to ensure no waterlogging takes place.

The Congress Wednesday urged the government to step up international pressure on Pakistan and move the International Court of Justice to enable Indian death-row convict Kulbhushan Jadhav to file a review petition against his death sentence. Party spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi said one cannot expect anything from Pakistan. "We have to put our faith in the Indian government. It must go flat out to ensure legal rights are granted to Kulbhushan Jadhav," he said.
 "They (Government of India) should move heaven and earth, they should make applications in the ICJ, the matter has not ended. They should create an adverse public opinion globally that how can a man who is defenceless not be allowed to exercise these rights," he added.
 Singhvi hoped that the government will take steps in the next few weeks rather than waiting for Pakistan to make amends. He was asked about Pakistani media reports that Jadhav refused to file an appeal in the Islamabad High Court against his death sentence.
 India on Wednesday called as "farce" Pakistan's claim that Kulbhushan Jadhav, on a death row in an alleged espionage case, has refused to file an appeal against his sentence. Spokesperson in the Ministry of External Affairs Anurag Srivastava said Jadhav has clearly been coerced to refuse to file a review in his case, and termed it as a "brazen attempt" to scuttle even the inadequate remedy available to him.
 "Pakistan's claim that Jadhav, who is incarcerated in Pakistan's custody, has refused to initiate review petition is a continuation of the farce that has been in play for the last four years," Srivastava said.

“As historian Eric Rauchway has recently reminded us, FDR spent the 1932 campaign making the case for a drastic new direction,” Kruse notes. “But Roosevelt wasn’t alone. That same year, the Senate held hearings to uncover the causes of the crash. After ten months, though, the Committee on Banking and Currency had accomplished little. Two successive investigators were dismissed for lackluster work and a lack of results before a third one was hired in January 1933, with hopes he might be able to scrounge some sort of report out of the thin findings and help the Senate save face.”

 One of the most insane industry stories of the 1990s was how Ninja Turtles co- creator Kevin Eastman managed to burn through $14 million in just three years with his own publishing company, Tundra. That money did pay for some all-time classics, though, including Scott McCloud’s _Understanding Comics_. A little- seen book from their UK line was _Skin_ , by Peter Milligan, Brendan McCarthy, and Carol Swain. Set in the skinhead scene of 1970's London, it starred a young man given short, flipper-like arms by the anti-nausea drug thalidomide, which was pulled off the market after it was found to cause birth defects when taken by pregnant women. It’s a harsh, challenging book that would translate incredibly to the screen.
