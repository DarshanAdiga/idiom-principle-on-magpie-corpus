Lindelof will lead United’s defence in the absence of Harry Maguire and has the job of keeping Neymar quiet. If he can get to grips with the Brazil star, there is also the searing pace of Kylian Mbappe to worry about.

Questo approccio rigoroso al progetto è stato figlio di una “società solida” caratterizzata da forti simboli identitari e ideologie politiche ben definite. Non poteva dunque che trovare il suo punto di rottura quando la società compatta di fine Novecento ha cominciato a trasformarsi: la crisi delle ideologie e l'affermarsi di un pensiero narcisistico e consumistico hanno portato Mari ad una radicale critica nei confronti dei nuovi fenomeni sociali.   È stato molto critico anche con le nuove generazioni di designer e in qualche caso anche con il design stesso. Qui potremmo vedere il limite del suo approccio dogmatico, rigoroso e poco propenso alla riscrittura, ma anche, allo stesso tempo, la sua grande forza nel tenere dritta la barra su alcune questioni di fondo.

In the final analysis, the cure for protracted and delicate national problems is to continue to strengthen the democratic process rather than engage in acts that can lead to generalized anarchy in which democracy cannot thrive. The protests have forcefully demonstrated the reality and potency of people’s power and the new energy must be tapped and channeled to strengthen, not weaken the country’s democracy. Surely, the country cannot remain the same after this. The government has demonstrated its sensitivity to the demands of the youth and must now be supported to implement the reforms it has committed itself to. It is a good sign that Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu in Lagos and a number of other state governments have speedily set up judicial panels of inquiry into acts of police brutality over the years. I urge the state governments which are yet to do so to emulate this example. This process of change should be supported and this cannot be done in an atmosphere of endless protests that are also crippling an economy already enfeebled by the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Lets just remember what would close in a Tier 3 lockdown, pubs, bookies, places where people are very low paid, and that's the point, people who work behind bars or who drive taxis, these are people that those in Westminster often forget but we are not going to do this.
 "We are taking a stand for them because if the government is going to place certain restrictions on us they will face harm from this.
 "It's not posturing to provide a voice for people at this particular moment in time.

It is important that the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) utilize this protest as an opportunity to go back to the drawing board and recommit itself to the values for which the party was formed through extraordinary hard work, dedication and commitment. There is no doubt that the party has recorded tremendous achievements in diverse sectors since 2015. But it now has to sit back, examine the gaps between its promises and its performance in order to make necessary amends. It is important that all members of the party put aside petty and shortsighted ambitions, needless infighting and unite to support the government of President Muhammadu Buhari to focus on delivering on its mandate for the remainder of its tenure.

The calendar is now spanning up to mid-March and the market, at least for the time being, tends to believe the current announced quantum will not be exceeded during 2020-21. Moreover, the additional borrowing is entirely in the 3-5 year segment, which enjoys strong demand, especially since the August announcement of the enhanced held-to-maturity (HTM) limits for commercial banks. Borrowing in the segment of bonds of 10 year or longer is relatively less as per the new calendar.
