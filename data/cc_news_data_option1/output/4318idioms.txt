On Sunday, the Yellow Army had some respite as they went on to beat Bangalore comprehensively by eight wickets to register their fourth win of the tournament.

For the past four years, the pairing of Gavin Ganun and Zack Horky have been a staple across Blissfield athletics whether it was on the gridiron, the court or the diamond.
   
 When you find one, the other is usually not far behind.
   
 For opposing defenses the past few seasons, that Ganun-to-Horky linkup has been one of the toughest to solve, as the pair being in near lockstep with one another has been a big contributing factor to making the Royal offense go all the way to a Lenawee County Athletic Association title and the program's first perfect regular season since 2007.
   
 "It's huge," Ganun said. "It's hard for teams to stop us because we know what we're gonna do before we even do it."
   
 Horky agreed.
   
 "We can both look at a defense and know exactly what we want to do," he said. "We don't even have to communicate it, we just know."
   
 Tandems like the one Blissfield has put together with Ganun and Horky, who are both going to Bowling Green to play baseball after their high school careers are up, are commonplace in football. Quarterbacks will generally have their favorite targets. Case in point, the Lions' Matt Stafford had Calvin Johnson.
   
 But longterm pairings in sports have become more and more due to various factors up and down the ranks.
   
 What has helped Ganun and Horky keep rolling with their rapport is the fact that the pair are together nearly year-round, being three-sport athletes in the same trio of sports (football, basketball and baseball) for Blissfield for that span.
   
 That rapport has served both well in the 2020 football season, as entering Friday night's LCAA and regular season finale at Onsted, both Ganun and Horky topped the county charts for the season, with Ganun leading in passing yards (1,292) and touchdown passes (18) while Horky leading in receptions (28) and receiving yards (531).
   
 "They've been playing together for a long time, and it's really neat to watch what they do," said Blissfield coach Ron Estes. "I'm just very, very pleased for these kids."
   
 Ganun entered Friday's contest tied with Lenawee Christian graduate Adam Baker for the most touchdown passes in a career in Lenawee County, as Ganun had pulled level after the Royals' Week 5 come-from-behind win over Ida that gave Blissfield a share of the LCAA title.
   
 After a two-play opening drive that resulted in two runs and a touchdown, Blissfield's air attack got going on that second drive, starting with a Ganun- to-Horky 15-yard completion. Once the Royals got inside the Onsted 30, Ganun dropped back, surveyed the field again, and delivered a strike that the six- foot-three Horky rose up over a Wildcat defender to haul in on the goal line.
   
 Career passing touchdown number 65 for Ganun, and no more fitting person to bring that one in than Horky.
   
 "It's nice," Horky said. "I was hoping I could get that one from (Gavin), so I'm happy."
   
 The game of course, still had to be played, and Horky's interception of Onsted's Dylan Terryberry gave Blissfield the ball in the redzone, which Ganun turned into another touchdown pass, this one on an 11-yard out to Ty Wyman.
   
 After getting the ball back again, it didn't take long for that connection to work its magic for one more score, as on a 3rd-and-8 from their own 35, Ganun dropped back and lofted a bomb downfield for Horky that the latter ran under, catching in stride and, outrunning the defense, going 65 yards to the house.
   
 Before it was all said and done Friday and the Royals claimed an outright LCAA title, Ganun finished with 13 completions for 254 yards and the three touchdown passes to push his career total to 67, with Horky bringing in six balls for 180 yards and two scores.
   
 Even so, the pair aren't done with the postseason looming, Blissfield will be a No. 1 seed in its district, meaning there are probably a few more touchdowns that are going come via the Ganun-Horky connection.

Poppey, Esther Winifred NEW LEBANON Esther Winifred Poppey, 83 of New Lebanon, went home with the Lord on October 22, 2020. Born on April 10, 1937, in Herkimer, N.Y., Esther was the daughter of Arthur C. Smith and Mary A. Smith. Esther worked for Coca Cola for many years before meeting her soulmate, Barry. Shortly thereafter, Esther and Barry were married and moved to New Lebanon where they raised their chosen children, Steven and Darcey. Esther later worked for Berkshire Farm Services for Youth as the administrative secretary. The kids at the "farm" all loved Esther and every once in a while, she would bring one of the kids home to enjoy a meal with her family. Esther always had a soft spot for those in need of extra love and care. While raising her own children, Esther fostered many other children and animals; she refused to let anyone be alone in this world. Some kids would stay a few days while others would stay a few years. She never asked for anything in return other than a smile and a hug. Shortly after her son's unexpected passing in 1990, Esther retired from Berkshire Farm and raised her granddaughter, Ashley. After Ashley moved onto adulthood, Esther took in her two older sisters and took care of them until their passing; all the while, guiding her daughter in the upbringing of her two other grandchildren. A true angel on earth, Esther selflessly spent her life taking care of others. Her family was her world. Esther loved Nascar (Gordon 24 all the way) and was a huge fan of Lebanon Valley Speedway, where her husband drag-raced their 67 Chevelle Super Sport. One trip to the Darlington Raceway in 2007 resulted in Esther and Barry setting new roots in South Carolina to enjoy their Golden Years. Wheel of Fortune was her favorite game show and once a year she would be a rebel and enjoy a Sloe Gin Fizz. Esther also enjoyed being on the bowling league at Bowling Green and Highway Recreation with Barry; the Jets were her favorite football team and she loved Christy Lane, Helen Reddy, Elvis and even Guns N' Roses. Her favorite color was pink, she loved doing crossword puzzles and she loved being on "The Facebook" to connect with her family and friends. Esther was not a woman of many words, but when she spoke, everyone listened. She lived by the grace of God and many times her ability to stay calm in the throes of a storm comforted many. She always sang "One Day at a Time" while she was cleaning the house. Devoted and loving wife to Barry; the world's most amazing mom to Steven and Darcey; sweetest gramma to Ashley (Trey) Watford, Samantha Bergdoll and Billy Bergdoll-Poppey; great-gramma to Ada Watford and Joey Spinner; daughter of the late Mary C. Smith and Arthur C. Smith; stepdaughter of the late Polly Smith; sister of the late Andrew A. (Linda) Smith, Carolyn Barnes, Dorothy Hay and Jennie (Ken) Boel; step-sister of John (Dodie) Weest. Esther is also survived by many nieces and nephews that she loved very much. She will forever be missed by her little furry companion, Palin. The family wishes to thank Esther's southern neighbors and adopted family, Cathi and Kurt Berger for all of their love and kindness over the years. Also, to the extremely compassionate staff at Albany Medical Center E.R. and C.C.U. that made her journey a very peaceful one. Relatives and friends are invited to call at the Thomas P. Mooney Funeral Home, 11 Elm St., Nassau on Wednesday, October 28, from 11 a.m. - 1 p.m. Interment in Cemetery of the Evergreens, New Lebanon will immediately follow. In lieu of flowers, donations in her memory may be made to the Mohawk Hudson Humane Society, 3 Oakland Ave., Menands, NY, 12204. Online condolences may be offered at Mooneyfuneralhome.com

 “Realizing everyday that I see my wife that there’s a piece of her heart that’s missing and that is one of the hardest things for me to try and digest," says Craig, "is that I’ve created this kind of grief for somebody else.”
 They've already spent thousands of dollars trying to find Pepper, but they're ready to pay more. A $2,000 reward is available for anyone who can get her home, no questions asked.
 Pepper is a grey and white female husky with blue eyes and she was last seen wearing a rainbow trout collar with the name "Koda" and the family's phone number on it. She answers to the name Pepper and is very friendly with strangers.

 Is it possible that as we age, we have the opportunity to move from outer strength to a more profound and resilient inner strength? Inner strength is gained through experience and challenges, and in the long run, it will outlast outer strength.
 As youth, we focus on being strong physically and mentally. Our attention is on developing the capacity to accomplish tasks and goals.
 Education and athletics depend on outer strength, but as life becomes more challenging, we have to develop additional skills to help us overcome life's obstacles. I think of it as a characteristic of Elders, but young children that face life-threatening illnesses often build extraordinary resilience and fortitude at a very young age.
 It may be partially due to their innocence and naivete, but the treatments and suffering they endure would devastate many adults.
 You can see inner strength in those who embody it. They are typically not physically powerful; as a matter of fact, they more likely are frail looking. They do not have a fierce countenance; instead, they have a kind and gentle expression.
 Of course, inner strength comes in all shapes and sizes, but it is not difficult to identify, and those who have it radiate that confidence to others.
 The longer we live, the more opportunities there are to develop resilience and grit. We are fortunate to make it through life with just a few setbacks, but aging itself becomes a challenge.
 Long after our physical and mental prowess has diminished, we have a new resource to call on. It is one of the gifts of aging. Inner strength is resilience, integrity, faith, perseverance and tenacity.
 It is the commitment to carry on when things aren't going your way. It's about receiving what life's challenges teach us, letting that transform who we are, carrying on with a different way of approaching things and a different focus in life.

Mumbai Indians all-rounder Hardik Pandya said their bowlers were left with “not much options” against the marauding duo of Ben Stokes and Sanju Samson, who executed their skills to perfection to guide Rajasthan Royals to an eight- wicket win here.
 Courtesy Pandya’s (60 off 21 balls) blitzkrieg, Mumbai put up an imposing 195 for five but Stokes and Samson made light work of the target, conjuring a match-winning unbroken 152-run second wicket stand to take Rajasthan home with 10 balls to spare.
 “Sometimes you have to give credit to the opposition as well, and I feel that they really batted well. Our bowlers had not much to do; it was their skills and execution, which worked for them...they were better today in batting,” Pandya said at the post-match press conference.
 The Baroda player, who smashed seven sixes and two fours, said they had enough runs on board and gave credit to Stokes and Samson for successfully chasing down the score.
 “Hitting sixes is fun, which I enjoyed. I thought we got enough runs, initially when the second strategic time-out happened we were looking more at 165-170, and obviously we got 25 runs more, which I thought was enough but credit goes to Stokes and Sanju, they really batted well,” he said.
 According to Pandya, luck was also on Rajasthan’s side. “They took their chances and I think even luck was there on their side ... actually multiple inside and outside edges went for boundaries. But having said that, they still played some outstanding shots, (about) which I don’t think our bowlers had much options (left) to do,” he said.
 Despite the hammering, Mumbai sit at the top of the top of the table with 14 points.
 “I feel from this game we should rectify our mistakes, and (fix) the other things we didn’t do and focus on the positives,” he said.
 “We are still sitting at number one, we need to play a couple of good games and we should be focussing on getting the top two position and keep focussing,” he signed off.

Alessandro "Alex" DiBiasio, 90, of Vandergrift, passed away Saturday, Oct. 24, 2020, in his home surrounded by his loving family. Alex was a devoted son, husband, father, grandfather and great-grandfather. He was a hard worker, and an honorable and respectful man, as well. He is remembered by his generous heart and selfless character, always the first to lend a hand to anyone who needed it. He was a true gentleman. Alex grew up in Italy, working on his family farm and serving in the Italian military. He expanded his professional experience, working in France in a metal factory and for an electric company. He also worked in Switzerland for Fluckiger, a watch manufacturer, until 1968. In April of that year, he moved his family to the United States, where he settled in Vandergrift. For the next 27 years, Alex continued his strong work ethic, working for Conrail, before retiring in 1995. He also did cement work on the side and was known for his attention to detail, only offering the best quality and precise craftsmanship. Anyone who visited Alex never left his home without a glass (and sometimes a bottle!) of homemade wine. He was known for his delicious wine, which he made yearly and shared freely with his family and friends. He was also an amazing gardener, spending many hours meticulously tending to his garden year after year, finding a way to plant some sort of vegetable or fruit throughout his entire yard. He was what many would call as having a "green thumb," managing to bring life to anything and everything he touched! Alex shared his little piece of Italy with all of us, inviting all to have a glass of wine and some homemade sausage and prosciutto on his patio, beautifully shaded by his grape arbor. Neighbors would often come by to visit and listen to the self-taught, skilled accordion player that he was, singing along and learning how to play Italian card games, like Scopa. Memories that will never be forgotten. Alex will be remembered most for his dedication and loyalty toward his family. He loved fiercely, never allowing them to forget how important they were and how proud of them he was. He was the protector of his family, always putting them first, loving and providing for them. His heart, however, belonged to his wife, Josephine, with whom he spent 66 beautiful years. She was his one true love, the woman who stole his heart. He always said that the best day of his life was the day he married her and he never let anyone forget that. Their relationship was like a love story, one in which the rest of us wished one day we'd have. To watch them ballroom dance together was like watching two people float on air. The love and respect they had for each other, through every struggle and obstacle life threw at them, was undeniable. They had four children, two of which had special needs, and together, as a team, they overcame all and every hardship that came along. They were true soul mates. Alex, with his strong, proud exterior, quickly softened upon sight of any of his children or grandchildren. He loved babies and was the first to hold and play with them, quickly gaining their trust and making them laugh. His heart was pure and his love for his family was unquestionable. Alex was one of a kind. He had a hard life, but a soft soul. The wonderful memories that we shared will allow him to live on forever in our hearts. He was so loved and will truly be missed! He was preceded in death by his parents, Giovanni and Maria Civita (Cappello) DiBiasio; twin daughters, Carmelina DiBiasio, and Elvira DiBiasio; and brothers, Emilio, Carmine, and Antonio DiBiasio. Alex is survived by his, wife of 66 years, Josephine (Trionfo) DiBiasio, of Vandergrift; children, John E. DiBiasio, of Vandergrift, and Emilia M. (Aldo) Pacchioni, of Allegheny Township; grandchildren, Alexa A. (Aaron) McCartney, Maria E. DiBiasio, Katelyn R. DiBiasio, Jason P. (Danielle) Pacchioni, and Brandon M. (Loren) Pacchioni; and great-grandchildren, Antwon, Callen, Caterina, Locryn, Elowyn, Remalyn, and Gia. Visitation will be held from 6 to 8 p.m. Tuesday, Oct. 27, 2020, in BRADY-CURRAN FUNERAL HOME AND CREMATION SERVICES INC., 429 Franklin Ave., Vandergrift. Mass of Christian Burial will be private in St. Gertrude Roman Catholic Church. Private entombment will take place in St. Gertrude Cemetery mausoleum.

 SEOUL, Oct. 26 (Yonhap) -- South Korea welcomes an agreement between Sudan and Israel to normalize their diplomatic relations and a subsequent U.S. decision to remove the African country from its list of terrorism-sponsoring countries, the foreign ministry said Monday. \n "Our government welcomes the agreement to normalize relations between Sudan and Israel and end hostilities, and expects the agreement to contribute to regional stability and a peace settlement," ministry spokesperson Kim In-chul said in a commentary. \n "In addition, the government welcomes the U.S. decision to remove Sudan from its list of state sponsors of terrorism and hopes that efforts to democratize Sudan and develop its economy will bear fruit." \n On Friday (U.S. time), the North African country and the Jewish state reached the deal brokered by the United States.

Notre Dame played its best game of the season in Saturday’s 45-3 obliteration of Pittsburgh, yet the Irish dropped a spot in the Associated Press and Amway coaches polls.
 The No. 4 Irish (5-0) were leapfrogged by No. 3 Ohio State (1-0), who defeated Nebraska 52-17 in its season opener Saturday.
 The promotion of Ohio State seemed inevitable at least in the AP poll. Eight of the 62 poll voters chose to omit from their ballots teams who had yet to play games because of COVID-19. With the Big Ten and Mountain West conferences starting their season this past weekend, a whole new crop of teams will have chances to impress.
 The coaches, like the AP voters, saw enough from the Buckeyes on Saturday to push them ahead of Notre Dame and No. 5 Georgia. No. 1 Clemson (6-0) and No. 2 Alabama (5-0) stayed put at the top of both polls.

A comment from James Wilson during a midweek interview really worried me.
 After the Doncaster defeat, the defender admitted there might have been some “complacency” after our flying start to the season.
 That word stopped me in my tracks. Complacency? What on earth did our team have to be complacent about?
  _The Portakabin changing room at Lincoln City. Picture Pagepix_
 Yes, they had a good start, but they really only beat teams who are likely to finish in the lower half of the table.
 What kind of club culture allows complacency to creep in after only half a dozen games? It seems absolutely extraordinary to me.
 Going back to Paul Lambert, he was wrong to blame the referee for the defeat and also appearing to defend Jon Nolan for his ridiculous red card challenge . The ref might have made some strange decisions, but he didn’t lose us the game. And Lambert should have been furious with Nolan, who will now miss three games when we are short of central midfielders.
 All of the above might seem unnecessarily negative.

 MORE: Watson’s five observations from the Lincoln defeat
 Maybe it is. We are, after all, sitting pretty in the play-off zone. We will, as I’ve said, probably win our next two games against poor opposition.
 But, even if we do, it won’t reassure me that anything has changed. The squad still seems to have the same frailties as last season, and we all know how that ended.
 If we come away from the Stadium of Light with three points then I will admit I’m wrong, but, sadly, I can’t see that happening. I would love to be proved incorrect.
 More immediately, Lambert needs to make changes in defence for the Gillingham game. After a surprisingly good start to the season, Toto Nsiala has now reverted to his old, clumsy self. The penalty he gave away at Lincoln was simply unnecessary. He needs to be replaced by Luke Woolfenden, playing alongside James Wilson.
 I would like to see young Arsenal loanee Mark McGuinness in action, but Wilson deserves to keep his place.
 So we move on. The games are coming thick and fast. We really could do with getting some of our injured army back in action.
 The reaction from Town fans after the Lincoln defeat was pretty damning, and shows just how jittery we are after what happened last season.
 It’s now down to the players - and the manager - to show us they have learned lessons from that debacle.
 I have to say, at the moment, I am far from convinced.

Rajasthan Royals’ star England all-rounder Ben Stokes is hoping that his swashbuckling return to form with a hundred would not just rejuvenate his side but also give some happiness to his family as it copes with his father Ged’s battle with brain cancer.
 Rajasthan rode on a blistering 107 by Stokes and an equally aggressive 54 by Sanju Samson to overhaul a 196-run target set by defending champions Mumbai Indians with 10 balls to spare on Sunday. The duo forged an unbeaten 152-run stand for the second wicket.
 “It’s a bit difficult at the moment, things are a bit tough back at home, hopefully, this will give them some happiness,” Stokes told official broadcaster _Star Sports_ in the post-match presentation.
 Stokes, who missed the early part of the tournament to be with his father in New Zealand, said he was relieved to finally come to the party after a sluggish start in the opening role.
 “Sort of bittersweet to be honest - it took so long to get one for the team. I would have preferred to get this form two or three games before when we weren’t relying on other results to get us through to the qualifiers,” he said.
 “Came into the game with a lot more confidence than the other games. Nice to spend some time out in the middle and finish the game off. The ball was coming on nicely - be it short or full.”
 Rajasthan Royals skipper Steve Smith described the partnership between Stokes and Samson as “sensational” and said the eight-wicket win was just the kind of result they needed to get their IPL campaign back on track.
 “Very pleased, that’s what we were crying for, two of our experienced players take the game deep and the way I think those two (Stokes and Samson) finished it off today and played was sensational, so very pleased,” Smith said.
 “I thought that partnership with him (Stokes) and Sanju was sensational,” added the Australian.
 Smith said that his team was lacking match-winning contributions from experienced players, which it finally got against Mumbai.
 “I hope our batters from tonight take a bit of confidence and momentum into the next game.
 “That is what we have lacked, our experienced players going on to make match- winning contributions and getting the team close to home or home, as they did tonight, so I thought the guys did a fantastic job and hopefully we can take that into the next two games,” he said.
 Losing skipper Kieron Pollard conceded that Mumbai were unable to contain the destructive duo of Stokes and Samson.
 “Sometimes in life you have to do that (say well played to the opposition). They batted fantastically well. But 195/5 at half-time, I thought Hardik brought us back into the game, but well played to Stokes and Samson,” said Pollard.
 “We got a couple of early wickets but were not able to capitalise on that. When you play a game of cricket, someone has to win and someone has to lose and we ended on the losing side this time around,” added the West Indian.

Is it possible that as we age, we have the opportunity to move from outer strength to a more profound and resilient inner strength? Inner strength is gained through experience and challenges, and in the long run, it will outlast outer strength.
   
 As youth, we focus on being strong physically and mentally. Our attention is on developing the capacity to accomplish tasks and goals.
   
 Education and athletics depend on outer strength, but as life becomes more challenging, we have to develop additional skills to help us overcome life's obstacles. I think of it as a characteristic of Elders, but young children that face life-threatening illnesses often build extraordinary resilience and fortitude at a very young age.
   
 It may be partially due to their innocence and naivete, but the treatments and suffering they endure would devastate many adults.
   
 You can see inner strength in those who embody it. They are typically not physically powerful; as a matter of fact, they more likely are frail looking. They do not have a fierce countenance; instead, they have a kind and gentle expression.
   
 Of course, inner strength comes in all shapes and sizes, but it is not difficult to identify, and those who have it radiate that confidence to others.
   
 The longer we live, the more opportunities there are to develop resilience and grit. We are fortunate to make it through life with just a few setbacks, but aging itself becomes a challenge.
   
 Long after our physical and mental prowess has diminished, we have a new resource to call on. It is one of the gifts of aging. Inner strength is resilience, integrity, faith, perseverance and tenacity.
   
 It is the commitment to carry on when things aren't going your way. It's about receiving what life's challenges teach us, letting that transform who we are, carrying on with a different way of approaching things and a different focus in life.
