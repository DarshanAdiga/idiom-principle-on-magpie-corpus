Il Consiglio dei ministri ha approvato il dl rilancio. "E' un testo complesso, con oltre 250 articoli. Parliamo di 55 miliardi, pari a due manovre, due leggi di bilancio. Un lavoro incredibile con i ministri e tutti gli staff tecnici, abbiamo portato a termine questa fatica", ha detto il presidente del Consiglio, Giuseppe Conte, in conferenza stampa. "Ogni ora di lavoro pesava perche sapevamo che dovevamo intervenire quanto prima. Sapevamo che il Paese era in attesa, abbiamo impiegato un po' di tempo ma non un minuto di piu di quello strettamente necessario. La parola ora passera al Parlamento. Con le forze di maggioranza, ma spero anche con il contributo dell'opposizione, mi auguro che questo testo possa essere migliorato", ha aggiunto il premier.

Unfortunately, President Donald Trump has weighed in on the face mask mandate issue by encouraging Americans to exercise their rights as citizens to choose not to wear a mask if they so please, even now, during a time when cases and deaths continue to rise.
 The sooner we follow all of the basic precautions, the sooner this pandemic will be over. In the meantime, this misguided philosophy of ‘live and let live’ is arrogant and selfish. So don’t get caught outside with your mask down. That is something to die for!

I took up a hobby three years ago that generates about $5,000 in annual income, which I put aside in a separate bank account. My wife asked, "What are you saving that money for?" I said, "Maybe a classic car, helping with a family reunion (on my side)," etc. She responded, "We need to be on the same page about how it gets spent because half of it is mine."

 ##  Steuart Pittman
 County Executive Steuart Pittman’s opinion column regarding Tim Altomare was really lame (The Capital, July 27). His police chief had just resigned, and Pittman told us he agrees with Altomare on several things.
 All of those things are mom and apple pie stuff that nobody could disagree with. However, Altomare’s reason for retiring is much more serious in nature than the pie in the sky Pittman is trying to paint. His reason: “I’m retiring now because of the movement to strip police of their powers” (The Capital, July 23)
 We should take his statement to heart because when politicians get involved with policing — politicians and citizen review boards who are clueless about the challenges and training and jobs of law enforcement officers — it will be disastrous for those of us who rely on police to keep the bad guys at bay.
 In his column, Pittman then ran through a laundry list of the protester’s views that he agrees with, which is far more extensive than the list of things he agrees with the police on. But to his credit, Pittman says he has gone to two Polar Bear Plunges since becoming county executive. Yay!
