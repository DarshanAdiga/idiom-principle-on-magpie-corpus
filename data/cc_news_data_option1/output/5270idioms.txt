I think ultimately, I don’t know that someone could have played this role on screen without having these very specific experiences or understanding that life experience. I do applaud Ryan for making the choice to hire young women who identify somewhere on the rainbow spectrum, because if you don’t walk that walk, you cannot talk the talk in this case, this particular case. Being a women of color specifically, it’s a complicated order living in 2020 so having the material even though it’s not a huge amount of material, there was enough space to go through that, to go through the emotions of that and if she had less material than what is actually there, I don’t know if we would have been successful.

 # A Twitter user compared house prices in Fall River and L.A. Here's what happened next.
 Lynne Sullivan Linda Murphy
 The Herald News
 FALL RIVER — Fall River has an abundance of stately homes, and now the world knows it.
 Well, maybe not the whole world, but thanks to a Tweet from B.M.C. Durfee High grad Hunter Reis, showing the difference between a $1 million home in Fall River vs. a $1 million home in Los Angeles, "Fall River" is trending on Twitter.
 The house Reis used for reference is the Nathan Durfee house at 503 Highland Ave. You can't miss the sprawling, English manor style home, just a few doors down from Charlton Memorial Hospital.
 According to the real estate listing, the home was built by Nathan Durfee from 1928 to 1930. The six bedroom, six and a half bath home boasts special details like "English grapevine crown molding," "detailed oak panel wainscoting," a billiard room, and "fairy tale etched stained glass throughout, provides an elegant whimsy with scenes from classic writers such as Charles Perrault."
 Certainly sounds like a buyer would be getting a lot of bang for his or her million bucks.
 The Los Angeles home, of course, only offers two bedrooms, one bathroom and 855 square feet of living space — the Fall River home offers nine times the space.
 Reis, who graduated from Durfee in 2013 and now works in Los Angeles for E News, said he was just looking through Zillow for fun and of course checked out what was available in Fall River.
 He grew up a couple blocks away, almost parallel to the house in the Tweet, in a three-family with his parents, Mike and Sharon Reis, grandparents and other family members. He remembers walking by the million-dollar home on Highland Avenue with his grandmother, Claire Reis.
 "My grandfather was a bus driver, and my Mémère and I would go for a walk and sit on a stump near that house to wave when he drove by," Reis said.
 Being a social media phenomenon of course means some commenters are dunking on Fall River. But Reis and others are quick to sing the city's praises and come to its defense.
 "You can criticize any town for what's there and what's not there," Reis said, adding that Fall River has good qualities "you don't notice until you move away."
 One commenter said the LA home is near ski resorts, beaches and wonderful dining options, and says the Fall River home is "near Applebee's." Stop it right no. Anyone from Fall River knows world class ski resorts are just a few hours away, some of the most beautiful beaches in the country are a short drive to Westport or Little Compton, and some of the finest Portuguese restaurants are mere steps from this home.
 In fact, Reis said one of the things he misses most about Fall River is the food. His dad sends him regular shipments of chourico, cacoila, sweetbread and chow mein.
 Some on Twitter said it looks haunted. Fall River is no stranger to haunted houses — Lizzie Borden's house, just down the road, has attracted ghost hunters and documentary makers — we think it adds "personality."
 Homebuyers with a penchant for the paranormal — and a bargain — can scoop up the home were Fall River's notorious Lizzie spent her last days for a mere $890,000. Located a few blocks away from the Nathan Durfee house, the three- story Maplecroft Mansion at 306 French St. boasts four bedrooms on its second floor and three on the third. Borden lived in the a Queen Anne style Victorian from 1893 to 1927 after she was acquitted of the murders of her father and step-mother.
 City Council President Cliff Ponte, real estate broker and operating principal of Keller Williams, South Watuppa, said Fall River trending on Twitter due to Reis’ Tweet is good news for the city. “It brings to light the uniqueness and character that real estate in Fall River possesses that is certainly overlooked and not appreciated as much as it should be,” said Ponte.
 The house at 503 Highland Ave. is one example of the homes in the Highlands area dating back to the 1800s that have been immaculately restored, he added. “The fact that it was Tweeted and Fall River is trending as a result of it only goes to show that real estate is booming, real estate in Fall River has character like no other community and it’s about time that our real estate is recognized at such a higher level.”
 And of course, someone on Twitter had to mention former Mayor Jasiel Correia. Not a shining moment, for sure, but he's just one guy, and we have a new mayor.
 Reis hasn't been able to visit his hometown since last Christmas, thanks to COVID-19, but he does look forward to coming back as soon as he can.
 Believe it or not, he said he was jealous of the recent snow. "I hated the snow, that was one of the biggest reasons to move away," he said. "Seeing all these pictures and videos [from home], it just looks so peaceful."
 So will Reis be coughing up a cool million to grab this house?
 "Maybe I'll start a Go Fund Me," he said.

NEW YORK (AP) — Kevin Durant shook off 18 months of rust in a matter of minutes. Durant looked good as new against his old team, Kyrie Irving was even better and the Brooklyn Nets emphatically kicked off the Steve Nash era with a 125-99 victory over the Golden State Warriors on Tuesday night in the NBA's season opener. Durant finished with 22 points in 25 minutes of his first official game since rupturing his Achilles tendon while playing for Golden State in Game 5 of the 2019 NBA Finals. It's a new start for Durant, but he did the same things he's been doing for years. “I tried not to make too big a deal out of this whole thing and realize I’ve been playing this game since I was 8 years old, so just got to revert back to what I know,” Durant said. Irving led Brooklyn with 26 points and Caris LeVert scored 20 as the Nets led by as many as 38, pouring on the points the way the Phoenix Suns did when Nash was their point guard, or more recently Golden State did when Durant was their All-Star forward. The Nets made the playoffs last season but now are expected to contend for the Eastern Conference title after finally getting Durant and Irving on the court together. They used the first game of the shortened, 72-game season to prove they might be worth the hype. “I think our goals are a lot higher this year and we just want to be able to come in and dominate and do that consistently,” Irving said. Stephen Curry had 20 points and 10 assists for the Warriors, a depleted team that looks nothing like the powerhouse that won two titles in Durant's three seasons there. Durant left shortly after having surgery following his injury and was expected to sit out the entire 2019-20 season even before it was suspended in March because of the coronavirus pandemic.

Following a strange offseason and a delayed start to this year's campaign, the Sacramento Kings and Denver Nuggets are ready to kick off 2020-21 when they meet in Colorado on Wednesday night.


  For the Kings, last season was another year in which the playoffs weren't in the mix, as they missed the postseason for a 14th straight year, the longest drought in the NBA. With some roster changes that will integrate young players, it will be a tough task to reach the postseason in the stacked Western Conference.


  Sacramento finalized its roster Monday by cutting Frank Kaminsky and giving a guaranteed contract to DaQuan Jeffries, who played on a two-way contract last season. Jeffries, 23, will complement the young trio of Tyrese Haliburton (20), Robert Woodard (21) and Jahmi'us Ramsey (19), who also made the roster.


  Once again the Kings have retooled after the departures of veterans Bogdan Bogdanovic, Kent Bazemore, Yogi Ferrell and Harry Giles III. They still have D'Aaron Fox, who signed a rookie extension last month.


  "It's a different day than any other day, this and the trade deadline," said Fox, who led the team in scoring (21.1 points a game) and assists (6.8) last season. "Sometimes you build a bond with guys really quickly and with them leaving, it doesn't stop you from talking or anything, but at the end of the day, there's a business side of the game and it is what it is."


  While Sacramento is trying to build a contender, the Nuggets feel like they're capable of challenging the Los Angeles Lakers atop of the Western Conference. Denver is coming off a deep run in the Orlando bubble, rallying from 3-1 series deficits against Utah and the L.A. Clippers before succumbing to the eventual- champion Lakers in five games in the conference finals.


  If the Nuggets are to challenge L.A., they'll have to do it with some notable changes. Gone are Jerami Grant, who spurned a three-year, $60 million offer from Denver for the same offer with Detroit, and Mason Plumlee, who also signed with the Pistons.


  The Nuggets quickly pivoted when Grant bolted, signing JaMychal Green, and brought back Paul Millsap on a one-year deal. Denver also drafted Zeke Nnaji and R.J. Hampton and signed 29-year-old Facundo Campazzo, who had played for Real Madrid. Campazzo is a rookie and is playing in a crowded backcourt, but he has made an impression in the short preseason.


  "Truth be told, Facu was not really a hidden gem," Rafal Juc, the Nuggets' international scout, told the Denver Post. "He was arguably a top-five European player for half a decade or so. So basically, he's been on our radar for a while."


  Denver's success will run through 7-foot center and triple-double threat Nikola Jokic, who averaged 24.4 points, 9.8 rebounds and 5.7 assists in the postseason. Only 25, Jokic and Jamal Murray have established themselves as the core of the Nuggets.


  Murray capped his third NBA season with an electric postseason with two 50-point games in the series win over the Jazz and a 40-point effort in Game 7 against the Clippers.

Auburn hired Boise State's Bryan Harsin as its next head coach on Tuesday night.
 Harsin will succeed Gus Malzahn, who was fired earlier this month after leading the program for eight years. Malzahn led the Tigers to the national championship game in 2013 but struggled to maintain a powerhouse since then, and the Tigers finished 6-4 this season.
 Harsin, 44, also replaced Malzahn at Arkansas State in 2013. He spent one season there, winning a share of the Sun Belt title, before moving on to Boise State and posting six consecutive seasons with 10-plus victories.
 "I'm incredibly excited and humbled for the opportunity to be at a place like Auburn University," Harsin said. "I knew it would take a special opportunity to get me out of Boise and Auburn is exactly that, the chance to compete at the highest level for one of the greatest programs in college football. I have a tremendous amount of respect for the coaches and players in the Southeastern Conference, but am ready to help build a foundation at Auburn where we can consistently compete for championships."
 Harsin won three Mountain West Conference titles and boasts a 69-19 record with the Broncos. Boise State lost to San Jose State in the MWC championship game this season and opted out of the bowl schedule because of COVID-19 concerns.
 Auburn president Jay Gogue said a diligent search for Malzahn's replacement led them to Boise.
 "We started the search with two goals," Gogue said. "We want a coach who will lead our team to consistently compete at the highest levels and to make Auburn proud on and off the field. We found both in Coach Harsin."
 Boise State president Marlene Tromp wished Harsin well in his next role and thanked him for his time with the Broncos.
 "Boise State has been on a stunning trajectory for decades and has effectively built on our previous successes," Tromp said. "Each of our head coaches has used his unique talents to enhance the excellence of this program -- an excellence we have all come to expect -- and we are confident our next coach will do the same."
 Other candidates for Auburn's top job included Hugh Freeze of Liberty and Kevin Steele, who served as the Tigers' defensive coordinator this season and was named as interim coach after Malzahn's exit.
 Auburn is set to face No. 14 Northwestern in the Citrus Bowl on New Year's Day.
 Boise State said it would begin an immediate search for Harsin's replacement.

“It’s always it’s never as good as you think it is and it’s never as bad as you think it is,” Caballero said after his team moved to 9-4. “That was one of those ones where I told the kids they persevered. Perseverance was the key.”


  While the overtime period won the game for the Yellow Jackets, the shot that sent the game into overtime was the highlight of the contest.


  Assumption’s Laron Truehill made one free throw, putting the Mustangs ahead 59-56 with 4.2 seconds left, giving Fortenberry enough time to heave a shot from just over half-court which found the mark as the buzzer sounded to end regulation tied at 59-59.


  “I made a turnover,” said Fortenberry, who finished with 26 points. “I felt like I had to make the shot to get back in the game. We needed it. It was more important. I felt it. It felt like I was going to make it.”


  Denham Springs’ Elijah Gilmore, who finished with 19 points, scored the first four points in overtime before Truehill completed a three-point play to cut the lead to 63-62 with 2:18 left.


  Gilmore came up with a steal and fed to Fortenberry, who was fouled and missed a pair of free throws.


  Truehill followed with an inside basket to cut the lead to 65-64, and the Yellow Jackets worked the ball around before Fortenberry was fouled and connected on a pair of free throws with 47.3 seconds remaining.


  “It feels good,” Fortenberry said of making the free throws. “I was fatigued, but I made them.”


  Assumption’s Brian Johnson was fouled on a 3-point attempt but made just one of three free throws to make the score 67-65 with 27.1 seconds to play.

New general manager Troy Weaver made dramatic changes to the Detroit Pistons' roster during the abbreviated offseason, and that handiwork will be on display when the Pistons begin their season at Minnesota on Wednesday.


  Neither team has taken the court for a regular-season game since play was halted in March due to the coronavirus pandemic. They were two of the eight teams who didn't get an invitation to last season's restart in Orlando.


  Detroit returns to action with four new starters and the returner coming off an injury-marred campaign. Former All-Star Blake Griffin barely played last season after he opted for left knee surgery in early January. He now finds himself surrounded by unfamiliar faces.


  "I'm the only person in this starting lineup that has run this offense before," he said. "You can kind of see that at times but that's to be expected."


  Former Denver Nuggets Jeremi Grant and Miles Plumlee agreed to contracts with Detroit in free agency. Grant officially was acquired in a sign-and-trade deal. The backcourt includes lottery pick Killian Hayes and Delon Wright, who was acquired in a trade with Dallas.


  Weaver's plan was to make defense the team's calling card. He wanted long- limbed athletic players who could seamlessly make defensive switches. Coach Dwane Casey has already seen that during an abbreviated preseason.


  "Defensively, we feel ready," Casey said. "Defensively, I think we're handling the curve. We signed defensive players, some toughness. With that, we're ahead of the curve. Offensively is what I'm concerned about more than anything else, guys understanding their roles, what they can do and playing to their strengths in our offense. That's our main challenge right now."


  The second unit, led by Derrick Rose, has the potential to be one of the league's highest-scoring benches.


  Griffin still anticipates the team will have to grind out victories.


  "I'm thankful we have our defense to sort of hang our hat on," he said. "That needs to be the case throughout the season."


  Anthony Edwards, the top pick in the 2020 draft, will be making his debut for the Timberwolves but is expected to come in off the bench. Edwards adds scoring punch -- he averaged 19.1 points in 32 games during his lone college season at Georgia.


  Veteran point guard Ricky Rubio is back for a second stint with the franchise. He was acquired in a three-team trade last month.


  Coach Ryan Saunders is still in the process of sorting out the roster.


  "Everybody would love to get to a predictable rotation," he said. "When you're in the rotation, you know when you're going in, when you've got to get ready, when to hop on the bike, those types of things. This year is not predictable, so depth is a key. I like that we've had a competitive camp."


  The team still revolves around Karl-Anthony Towns and D'Angelo Russell.


  Towns averaged a career-high 26.5 points and 4.4 assists last season but only appeared in 35 games due to a wrist injury. Russell, 24, averaged more than 20 points for the second straight season. He averaged 23.1 points over 45 games, which started with the Golden State Warriors.


  Towns has yet to establish himself as a difference-maker on the defensive end and he's trying to alter that.


  "It's been a very genuine experience," Saunders said of Towns' approach during training camp. "You can see a change, a shift, in the mindset."

The Billy Donovan era will tip off for the Chicago Bulls when they host the Atlanta Hawks on Wednesday night in the season opener for both teams.
 Chicago hired Donovan during the shortened offseason to replace Jim Boylen, who went 39-84 in less than two seasons at the helm. Donovan quickly became the Bulls' top target after a five-year tenure with the Oklahoma City Thunder, who were 243-157 under his leadership and made the playoffs every season.
 "What I like is he (has a commanding) presence," said Bulls guard Zach LaVine, who had several conflicts with Boylen last season but quickly has jelled with Donovan. "He's very straightforward. You can tell if we're doing good or bad, obviously.
 "He wants us to fight. He brings that out of us. He's encouraging us to be competitive and bring it every night. I'm trying to take it upon myself to get the group going in the beginning. He's good for us. He knows what he's doing."
 Like Chicago, Atlanta also is looking to take a big step forward after limping to a 20-47 record last season. The Hawks brought in several veterans including guards Rajon Rondo and Bogdan Bogdanovic, as well as forward Danilo Gallinari and center Clint Capela, to bolster a roster that was talented but inexperienced.
 Rondo has been ruled out of Wednesday's opener because of COVID-19 protocols, and Capela might not play because of a sore Achilles tendon.
 Hawks coach Lloyd Pierce has high hopes for star guard Trae Young, who enters his third season in the league. Young averaged a whopping 29.6 points and 9.3 assists last season, and the Hawks are looking to give him more chances to create.
 "I think the game is going to become more simplified for him, and he's going to have more fun with it," Pierce said.
 The teams met three times last season before the league shut down in mid- March. Chicago went 3-0, with each victory coming by double digits.
 Wednesday will mark the NBA debut for Bulls rookie Patrick Williams, who was selected No. 4 overall in the 2020 NBA Draft out of Florida State. Williams enjoyed a promising preseason while showing flashes of his ability on both ends of the court.
 Atlanta's top pick was big man Onyeka Okongwu, the sixth overall selection out of Southern California. However, Okongwu will miss the first two games with a foot injury. Upon returning, he'll likely will take on a reserve role in the early going as he learns from Capela, who will command the starter's role.
 Both teams hope to finish the season stronger than they start it.
 Donovan has emphasized mental toughness to his Bulls players. He cautioned them against getting too high or too low after a particular play or game.
 "A lot of times because we have really good guys that want to do well and do the right thing, sometimes they can get deflated," Donovan said. "And we've got to understand that there are going to be 100 possessions on offense and 100 possessions on defense, and not every possession is going to go well. We have to have a level of resiliency, mental toughness, mental fortitude to fight through difficulties."

And that's why it was so windy yesterday, because of all the hot air blowing out of his ass-that's where his decisions come from!
 I think it's great that he's issued this proclamation. That way, any hardcore visitors who would have otherwise come to Seattle can't/won't. I mean, letting it devolve into a homeless shit-show just wasn't enough. His 'commonsense' decision is just the icing on the cake. It's the same level of commonsense we saw him exhibit when bring fruit over here.

The San Francisco 49ers and Arizona Cardinals meet up at a familiar setting when the NFC West rivals duel on Saturday afternoon in Glendale, Ariz.
 The rematch of a 24-20 Arizona win in Week 1 has far more significance for the Cardinals (8-6), who remain in the running for an NFC playoff spot, than the 49ers (5-9), whose bid to repeat as conference champs officially ended with last week's loss at Dallas.
 Both teams will be playing on the State Farm Stadium field for the third time in the last four weeks, with the 49ers having been forced to relocate from Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, Calif., because of COVID-19 restrictions in the region.
 The 49ers have lost their first two neutral-site games in Arizona, beaten in Week 13 by Buffalo 34-24 and then a week later by Washington 23-15.
 The 49ers were thumped 41-33 at Dallas last week, and lost far more than just a game that eliminated them from playoff contention. Top running back Raheem Mostert has been ruled out for the season after aggravating a high ankle sprain in the loss, while quarterback Nick Mullens suffered an elbow injury that the 49ers fear could require Tommy John surgery.
 Regular starter Jimmy Garoppolo has returned to practice after suffering an ankle injury against Seattle in Week 8, but San Francisco coach Kyle Shanahan noted that he's unlikely to get medical clearance to return to game action either this week or in the finale against Seattle, another game that will be played in Arizona.
 "(He will play) only if the doctors told me it's 100 percent safe and he feels good, and I'd be very surprised if that happens," Shanahan reported. "Right now, he's safe to go out to practice. It'll be fun for him to throw the ball around a little bit, but we're going to be very safe with him this week and we'll see next week. But I'd be very surprised if that changes."
 Shanahan wouldn't name a starter for the Arizona game as the practice week began, but by process of elimination, the last man standing appears to be C.J. Beathard, who came on in mop-up duty in Dallas and threw a 49-yard touchdown pass to Kendrick Bourne on the final play of the game.
 The 49ers have since gone out and plucked veteran Josh Rosen off the Tampa Bay practice squad to serve as Beathard's backup.
 The Cardinals, meanwhile, will take the field in third place in the NFC West, two games behind Seattle (10-4) and one back of the Los Angeles Rams (9-5). Arizona visits the Rams next week.
 The Cardinals can clinch a wild card this weekend with a win over the 49ers and a Chicago (7-7) loss to Jacksonville (1-13).
 Kyler Murray kept Arizona in a favorable position when he threw for a season- best 406 yards and three touchdowns in last week's 33-26 home win over Philadelphia.
 But like the 49ers, the Cardinals didn't escape the game unscathed. Veteran wideout Larry Fitzgerald strained his groin and star linebacker Haason Reddick injured his shoulder in the win, leaving both a bit iffy for the San Francisco game.
 Murray, who rushed for 91 yards but threw for just 230 in the earlier loss to the 49ers, warned not to overlook a prideful opponent.
 "Good team," he insisted. "They'll be ready to go, obviously. It's a divisional game. It's going to be very competitive."

Even though the bill passed in both the House and the Senate, President Donald Trump threatened to veto it on Tuesday. He posted a video on Twitter in which he shared a number of criticisms that he has for the bill. Most notably, he took issue with the amount allocated for stimulus checks (under this proposal, eligible Americans would receive a $600 check). The president said, "I am asking Congress to amend this bill and increase the ridiculously low $600 to $2,000, or $4,000 for a couple." Many Democrats, such as Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, have already said that they would be on board for $2,000 direct payments. However, it's unclear if that measure will garner enough support in Congress.

Guests arrived in elegant velvets or utilitarian puff vests. Hand- crafted hats of Christmas tinsel, Elizabethan gowns and costumes sparkling with sequins brought more smiles and gaiety."

This year I took a picture of the stockings to send to my younger son. Of course I sent a picture of the stocking on the bookshelf. On a shelf is the picture of me with my stocking. My son sent back wondering when the picture was taken. I thought it was in 1953 or 1954, He wrote back “Best Christmas Ever!” Well, maybe it was.
 But, I’m trying to find out about another picture. We found an old negative that we are sending off to be developed. We are not sure of what is really in the picture. We think it is a picture of my brother, my sister and me. I think the picture was taken at my grandparents’ house.
 In the picture there looks to be a large gift package. When I was young some of the grocery stores sold a big package that had all sorts of toys and things in a big package. It had toys for boys and girls, firecrackers and there was a little packet you could add fruit to the big package. There was big cardboard front that listed what was in the package and it said “All This for only $11.98.”
 I’m excited to get the picture back and see what it really is. I’m hoping to be able to read about all the things that are in the package. Of course this picture was taken over 50 years ago.
 Fun to imagine what $11.98 would buy back then. I do have some friends that will tell me that $11.98 was a lot of money back then. Still I’m excited to get the picture back. I may get it framed and put by my stocking picture. Then I’ll know for sure about the Best Christmas ever. Merry Christmas.
