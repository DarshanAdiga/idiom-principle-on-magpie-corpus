This is why, even when we had the technology to achieve the task, video calls never replaced traditional calling methods. It exhausted us in ways we could avoid, offering few tangible benefits in many uses. This is also why, in business, systems like Zoom proved such a hit. In business, there isn't space for ambiguity. Accuracy and understanding are key, and as we understand these as fundamental elements of work, we both need and accept them in modern video conferencing.

 "We literally took up every register at the grocery store and family after family would go through," Jason Lobdell, one of the benefactors, told CNN affiliate WXIA. "We took over all 12 aisles for two hours."
 He told WXIA he and his friends spent around $40,000 at a Kroger in Decatur, Georgia, a suburb of Atlanta.

Most fundamentally misunderstood in video calling was the added stress and complexity which arises when talking face to face.

BERLIN (AP) — Chancellor Angela Merkel urged Germans to remain patient with restrictions meant to slow the spread of the coronavirus, saying Thursday that with promising vaccines on the way, “there is light at the end of the tunnel.” Addressing parliament the day after agreeing with state governors on extending restrictions through at least Dec. 20, Merkel said officials had sought with the measures to keep life as normal as possible while protecting people from the virus and ensuring hospital systems aren't overwhelmed. “In the fight against the pandemic it's not about health or economy, health or education, health or culture, health or social contacts, it's about all of these things,” she said. “To think of these things in opposition to one another is a common misunderstanding, but it's always about both.\" Germany embarked on a so-called wave-breaker shutdown on Nov. 2, closing restaurants, bars, sports and leisure facilities but leaving schools, shops and hair salons open. It was initially slated to last four weeks but Merkel and the country’s 16 state governors agreed late Wednesday to extend it through Dec. 20 with a goal of pushing the number of new coronavirus cases in each region below 50 per 100,000 inhabitants per week. It’s currently at 140 per 100,000, with some regions far higher. The country hit the grim milestone Thursday of more than 15,000 deaths from the coronavirus and appeared likely to surpass 1 million infections on Friday, according to data from the Robert Koch Institute, the country's disease control center. Germany, which has 83 million people, was credited with a relatively good performance in the first phase of the pandemic. It still has a lower death rate than several other European countries, and its current shutdown has...

In Johnson's first weekend of her senior year with the Bronchos, she's recorded her two highest-scoring games at Central Oklahoma. Johnson kicked off the season with a 30-point, 11-rebound outburst against Missouri Southern, and the Bronchos needed every last one of those points in a 75-74 win. She followed that performance up with another double-double, this time a 26-point, 13-rebound showing in a 30-point win over Pittsburg State. If this is only Week 1, we could see Johnson's name here a few more times throughout the season.

The serendipities and mythos attached to The Lido are only enhanced with the passage of time. Just last spring, when the PGA Championship was held at nearby Bethpage Black, The Golf Channel U.S. weighed in. Prior to the Lido’s construction, the American magazine Country Life held a design contest, whereby the winning golf hole submission would actually be built, by Macdonald and Raynor, at The Lido Club. First place went to a then-unknown Alistair Mackenzie. His entry would become Lido’s 18th — reprised once more as the 18th at Ballyshear. Another entrant was Seth Raynor himself, whose runner-up effort (called Dog’s Leg) was also realized at The Lido — and reproduced at Ballyshear’s par-4 2nd hole.

The original Lido Club design was entirely man-made on flat, sandy terrain at seaside. Soil manipulation was easy and cheap. The construction effort in Bangkok proved no such thing. The terrain was appropriately flat but proved extraordinarily challenging in other ways. The high water table in Bangkok, for example, required the construction team to drive thousands of concrete pile-ons into the mucky soil — the support the towering man-made landforms created above the surface.
