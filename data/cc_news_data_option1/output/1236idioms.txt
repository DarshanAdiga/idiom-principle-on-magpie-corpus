KEITHVILLE, La. (AP) " For more than 20 years, Susan and Wayne Nichols shared a prayer that the questions surrounding an infant boy who was found dead after being discarded in a trash bag would be answered.


  Wayne found the child after he witnessed a stray dog bury it between the beams at a structural steel fabrication plant where he worked in March 1999.


  The event changed both of their lives, giving them a stronger call to help others, Susan recalled. Wayne died just before his 65th birthday in late 2019. After finding the infant, he became a full-time firefighter and spent the remainder of his career in fire emergency service. Susan, who was a volunteer firefighter at the time, now works as a deputy emergency communications officer at the DeSoto Parish Sheriff's Office.


  'You know, hopefully, something can break and they can, you know, find out who it is and just put the case to rest. Because the fact that the case is cold and, you know, and that nothing has been found or done is, you know, I don't know. It's like the baby still can't rest in peace," Susan said.


  "It's our prayer. It's been Wayne's and it's mine as well. Hopefully, the case can be resolved," she continued.


  FRIDAY, MARCH 26, 1999


  Workers of a structural steel fabrication plant of Kenneth Salley Enterprises Inc. dodged a black-plastic bag near the center line of the road on their way to work, in the 11600 block of Old Mansfield Road. It wasn't uncommon for unwanted animals and trash to be left on that stretch of road, according to workers in a previous report.


  But around noon that day, Wayne, a welder, was on lunch break and saw a stray dog with something in his mouth. His first thought was that the dog may have a chicken or something, he told The Times in a 1999 report.


  The dog was on the other side of the road, so it was unclear. As the dog approached the plant's yard, Nichols then thought it could possibly be a baby.


  He followed the dog toward stacks of rusty, steel beams and then watched the dog emerge from the stacks, no longer carrying anything. Wayne notified the office to call the sheriff's department and was joined by a few other workers to search for what the dog may have left behind.


  Another worker found what appeared to be a small hand sticking up between two beams. All but the child's hand was buried in the ground.


  Deputies arrived on the scene soon after.


  The baby was estimated to be no older than just a few days old. Bloody newspapers and towels were also found by investigators, but his head was missing.


  'It affected my husband, of course, terribly for a long time. He, um, he would have nightmares, he would, um...," Susan said, taking a brief pause while attempting to contain her emotions.


  "There was a couple of times he was driving down the road and he would see like a, um, he would, he would see something on the side of the road or (he) would see a trash bag, you know, and he'd have a reaction and flash back to it," she continued.


  THE INVESTIGATION


  Caddo Sheriff deputies captured the dog and it was later euthanized so its stomach contents could be analyzed. Inside the dog's stomach appeared to be skull and cap, and some facial tissues, The Times previously reported.


  Local hospitals were checked to see if the mother showed for medical attention.


  At the beginning of the investigation, the baby was estimated to have been less than a day old. But later news reports said that he was probably about two to three days old. The child's umbilical cord was still attached.


  There was also uncertainty on whether the baby was black or white; if whether the baby was alive when his head was decapitated; the possibility that the child wasn't born alive due to the condition of the remains; and what removed the child's head.


  Investigators now believe the baby is white, and that he was alive when born.


  DNA was taken from the scene. The blood on the newspaper and towels were determined to not belong to the infant, but possibly the mother. This DNA information was put into the FBI's Combined DNA Index System (CODIS), but there were no matches.


  The case was reopened last May. Caddo Sheriff's detective Jeremy Prudhome has considered the possibility, among many, of the mother being a young girl at the time. He has followed up with individuals who were pregnant or young mothers then and checking on what happened to their children.


  He also talked with longtime residents.


  'They remember it happening, but they don't remember anything as far as hearing about anybody that was involved," he told The Times in a previous report.

The simplest version of this squishy robot is an inflated tube that runs through three small machines that pinch it into a triangle shape. One machine holds the two ends of the tube together; the other two drive along the tube, changing the overall shape of the robot by moving its corners. The researchers call it an “isoperimetric robot” because, although the shape changes dramatically, the total length of the edges – and the amount of air inside – remains the same.

Life has gotten that much tougher for people who are already suffering from anxiety or are going through bouts of depression. Psychiatrists are stressing that such people must do their best to continue with their pre-set routine. “This is not the time to be lazy and succumb to fears; months of counselling will then go down the drain,” says Dr Babu. He advises patients to not stop their medication (if they are taking any), and if the need arises, not hesitate to call or e-mail their primary caregiver even if they cannot visit them physically. “Stay connected to those who matter to you — quarantine does not mean you are not allowed to hear each other’s voices.”

"Within minutes, they're all basically on board," said Joe Aitken, director of sales and marketing for Brian's Custom Sports, on Saturday. "Part of it is the ability to keep working. The other part is the fact that you're helping for the greater good."


  Before Aitken's team could return to the Kingsville, Ont., plant, some logistics had to be worked out. Brian's had no pattern for the 18,000 medical gowns they had committed to making, so one was brought from a local hospital and was carefully taken apart to reverse-engineer a template.


  Making sure the sewing equipment would work was also an important step as Brian's Custom Sports uses heavy-duty machines designed to punch through the thick padding and faux-leather of goalie equipment and not the thinner repurposed bed sheets they had been sent to make the gowns from.


  Brian's normally produces equipment for NHL goalies including Thatcher Demko of the Vancouver Canucks, Robin Lehner of the Vegas Golden Knights, and Jaroslav Halak of the Boston Bruins.


  Linus Ullmark, a goalie with the Buffalo Sabres organization, was one of the first to like Brian's Instagram post about the change in production even though he's not a client.

WASHINGTON -- It's hard to focus on right now, but this November we're going to have a presidential election that may be the most important in our lifetimes.


  How, exactly?


  All we can say for certain, in this plague year, is that we won't do it the way we expected. The election will take place in the shadow of a pandemic that has affected every state in the union, killed more than 1,000 Americans thus far and dramatically changed how we live and work. We're going to have to make this up as we go along.


  Just three weeks ago, after the Super Tuesday primaries, it looked as if we would know by now who the Democratic challenger to President Trump will be. Former Vice President Joe Biden's lead in pledged delegates over Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., was on track to become mathematically insurmountable, and Sanders would almost surely have had to suspend or end his campaign. It was supposed to be all over but the shouting.


  But because of COVID-19, potentially decisive primaries in Ohio, Georgia and other states have been postponed. At this point, with most Americans asked or ordered to practice social distancing, it is unclear when it will be possible to resume the primary process - or how that can be done safely.


  So the Democratic race is in suspended animation. Biden looks like the certain nominee, but this status has not been made official -- and Sanders has not dropped out. There was supposed to be another debate between the two candidates in April, but the Democratic National Committee has not yet scheduled it. Sanders has said he is ready and willing to participate; Biden, perhaps understandably, has said that "I think we've had enough debates."


  The primaries, when they resume, will probably look and feel different. There will likely be much more of an emphasis on mail-in voting, which will make it hard or impossible for officials to report results on the night of the primary. That would mean no victory or concession speeches, which is just as well, since those ritualistic appearances would seem pointless in the absence of wildly elated or sorely disappointed crowds. And crowds of any kind, of course, are at this point out of the question.


  If Sanders dropped out, all of the above would be academic -- but only for the presidential race. State parties still need to choose candidates for important down-ballot contests, including Senate and House races. Somehow, the primaries have to be held.


  What about the party conventions? As of now, the Democratic Party is planning to hold its convention July 13-16 in Milwaukee and the Republican Party intends to gather Aug. 24-27 in Charlotte. That's the idea, at least -- and perhaps by summer it will be safe to return to politics as usual. But what if it isn't?


  Anyone who has been on the crowded, bustling floor of a major-party convention knows that even the most diabolical Bond villain could hardly design a more perfect environment to guarantee the spread of a dangerous pathogen. Attendees come from around the country and spend four days in the closest proximity, sitting cheek by jowl, squeezing past one another, glad- handing with other delegations, cheering and chanting and otherwise expelling whatever happens to be lurking in their respiratory tracts.


  Normally, that's not a serious problem -- some people might go home with colds that they end up passing on to family and friends. But this year? Seriously?


  And then sprint to November is supposed to begin. In a best-case scenario, the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19 may turn out to be seasonal, like influenza, and new infections could naturally decline during warm-weather months. Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said Wednesday he believes this may be the case. That means we might get a respite. But it also means, Fauci said, that we should prepare for a second wave of infection and transmission when the weather again turns cold.


  According to the Centers for Disease Control, flu season usually begins in October. If COVID-19 follows that schedule, that second wave would begin washing over the nation just before Election Day.


  We have to start imagining a presidential campaign without campaigning. Will there be rallies? Will "pressing the flesh" seem a dangerous bygone practice? Will the battle take place exclusively on television and online?


  It will be challenging to hold a legitimate national election in the shadow of COVID-19. The time to start planning how to do this is now.Eugene Robinson's email address is eugenerobinson@washpost.com.

Aside spuds (which sprouts in about the third week’s end), few vegetables can survive two weeks shelf life even on refrigeration. A better way says Chef Praveen Shetty (Executive Chef, Conrad) is to process it into a paste, a chutney or even steam it. Turn onions into a paste along with tomatoes, stalks of coriander and fry it before storing it in the freezer. Once fried and frozen in a glass container, the paste can stay for three months at a stretch without losing its flavour. If you have to store it in the fridge segment, add a dash of lemon for extra preservation. The same goes for spinach, corn and even pepper and cauliflower, which can be part roasted and then steamed to get that amazing flavour.

The nearly 900-foot-long USNS Comfort, which was once an oil tanker, is a floating trauma hospital designed to care for service members who've been in combat.


  But on this mission, it will essentially serve as a community hospital.


  "What we're bringing to the people of New York is a hospital ship with a maximum capacity of 1,000," said Capt. Patrick Amersbach, the commanding officer of the medical treatment facility aboard the Comfort.


  The ship has 12 operating rooms as well as radiology suites and a CT scanner. It also has ICU beds, a lab and a pharmacy.


  The 1,100 or so medical staff on board are mostly active duty service members from the U.S. Navy, and some reservists, who serve on the East Coast.


  "I really want to thank the families - those who are staying behind," Amersbach said. "Because this is a national crisis. And their loved ones are leaving to go north to help those in New York. I really appreciate what they're doing and the sacrifices they are making."


  The arrival of the oblong ship, with its white hull and red crosses, is often a signal of the severity of a crisis.


  Since the current iteration of the USNS Comfort launched in 1987, the vessel has responded to wars in the Middle East, Hurricane Katrina and New York City after the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.


  But the current mission is unprecedented in the ship's century long history, which stretches back to World War I.


  "We've never deployed a hospital ship stateside specifically for a response in a global pandemic," said André B. Sobocinski, a historian for the U.S. Navy Bureau of Medicine and Surgery.


  The closest the USNS Comfort has come to being in a situation like this was during World War I and the flu pandemic, Sobocinski said.


  The ship ferried soldiers from Europe back to the states, and some of the men most likely had the flu. The Comfort also handled overflow soldiers from military hospitals in New York. The difference now is that the ship is handling overflow from civilian hospitals in the city, Sobocinski said.

He has been unable to put any basketball strategy to use for more than two week, but Brad Stevens is still putting together some diagrams.


  With the NBA on hold due to the coronavirus, the Celtics coach has been home with wife Tracy, son Brady and daughter Kinsley since March 12, and on Friday afternoon, Stevens' children were due to receive a lesson about the pandemic.


  "I was just putting together a PowerPoint to show our kids today where this is nationally, where this is locally here in the New England region, all the different ways people are helping and doing their part as we're sitting in our own little bubble being self-quarantined and isolated," said Stevens during a conference call with the media Friday morning.


  "I'm driving these two crazy. I love being around them. We could be around each other 24 hours a day and they wouldn't drive me crazy. I think you dial that back to 12 minutes now that they're 10 (Kinsley) and especially 14 (Brady). That is the way it goes."


  Stevens has not done any coaching since the NBA suspended the season on March 11, the night before the Celtics were supposed to play the Bucks in Milwaukee.


  The team returned home the next day and were checked for the virus since one of their recent opponents, Rudy Gobert of the Utah Jazz, tested positive.


  Marcus Smart is the lone member of the Celtics whose test came back positive, but according to Stevens, he has shown no symptoms. Smart announced he had the coronavirus on March 19.


  "I'm just happy that when he tested positive he continued to experience no symptoms and has felt great ever since," said Stevens. "We landed from Milwaukee 15 days ago now and he's been feeling good. I've checked in with him as everybody else has very regularly. I've seen him on conference calls a few times.


  "He seems to be doing really well. I'm proud of how he kind of took the initiative to tell people that he had it and he felt good. He got on line and continued to asked people to practice social distancing and self-isolation right now. He's great, great spirits, joking as always."


  The Celtics players and coaches have chatted a couple of times via a Zoom conference and will do so next week as well in order to stay in contact.


  Stevens said that exercise bikes and weight-lifting equipment have been delivered to the homes of players to allow them to stay in shape.


  There is no indication that the season will either resume or be canceled due to the virus, but if games are played again later in the spring or during the summer, a training camp is going to be needed. Team facilities were recently shut down, so players are unable to work out there.


  "There's ultimately going to be the need for kind of the re-acclimation for the individual drills to ramp up your own individual conditioning, which our guys are trying to do as much as they can in their homes and in their apartments and those type of things right now," said Stevens.


  "I think it'll be interesting. That's assuming we get back to playing. I know they're bouncing around a ton of scenarios right now. There's no doubt there would be a kind of getting in shape, re-acclimation phase that would have to be part of that."


  The Celtics were 43-21 and third in the Eastern Conference with 18 games remaining when the season was put on hold.


  Stevens said when the team meets via conference call, basketball matters are not the top priority.


  "We're like the rest of the world," he said. "Basketball has taken a far back seat. I think it's more important right now we're a community of co-workers and a community of friends and people that care about each other that get on line and make sure we're all doing OK. Everyone's checking in every day individually.


  "I just don't think it's appropriate right now to be hammering basketball with our guys."


  Stevens is paying close attention to the news every days and admires the medical personnel who are working round the clock to deal with the pandemic.


  "We're calling sitting at home an inconvenience, right? What a joke," he said. "There's so many people working so hard every day to try to help our communities and help the sick and putting their own selves at risk. Any time you turn on the TV, it hits home even more.


  "I'm not a scientist. I listen to the people that are. I pay attention to the people that are. If they tell me to do something, I'm doing it."

Madrid, 28 mar (EFE).- Mireia Belmonte, vigente campeona olimpica de natacion, reconocio este sabado que el aplazamiento de los Juegos Olimpicos de Tokio hasta 2021 fue una decision "superacertada" que para ella ha supuesto "un alivio" por como le estaba afectando a su preparacion la pandemia de coronavirus.


    "Ha sido un alivio porque despues de estos dias sin entrenar y sin piscina hemos bajado la forma fisica y todavia nos quedan bastantes dias en casa confinados" explico durante el macroconcierto solidario "LaLiga Santander Fest", que recauda fondos para la lucha contra el COVID-19.


    La nadadora española recordo que por la situacion mundial "no todo el mundo acudia a Tokio en las mismas condiciones", a lo que se añadia el riesgo de que, en el caso de viajar a la capital japonesa algun afectado por coronavirus, "acabaria saliendo mas gente enferma de la que entrase".


    Por ultimo, la deportista catalana mostro su agradecimiento a todos los que estan colaborando estos dias en proyectos solidarios en favor de los afectados, a los que se han quedado en casa para frenar la expansion del COVID-19 y a quienes han seguido las recomendaciones de las autoridades sanitarias desde el primer dia.


    "LaLiga Santander Fest", transmitido a 180 paises y en el que participan desde sus hogares medio centenar de artistas de la talla de Alejandro Sanz, David Bisbal o Juanes, y jugadores de los veinte equipos de LaLiga española, pretende recaudar fondos para la lucha contra la pandemia.


    Entre los deportistas participantes destacan el tenista Rafael Nadal, que intervino como embajador del Banco Santander, y futbolistas como Gerard Pique e Ivan Rakitic (FC Barcelona), Sergio Ramos y Lucas Vazquez (Real Madrid), Saul (Atletico de Madrid), Dani Parejo y Rodrigo Moreno (Valencia) o Joaquin Sanchez (Betis).


    Los fondos recaudados con "LaLiga Santander Fest" se destinaran a la adquisicion de productos necesarios para combatir la pandemia y se canalizaran siguiendo las prioridades sanitarias del Gobierno español en coordinacion con el Consejo Superior de Deportes (CSD).

A New York State Police Bomb Technician examined the device and confirmed that the device, a pipe bomb, appeared to be a functional destructive device. During the examination of the device, the bomb technician utilized a “Disruptor,” a tool used to knock off the end cap of the device in an attempt to disassemble and disable the device remotely. During this procedure the device detonated.


  Following the incident on the Thruway, investigators executed a search warrant at Gandia’s Cedar Avenue residence in the Falls. They recovered nine suspected destructive devices, all appeared to be of similar construction as the device recovered from the defendant’s vehicle.


  Five of the suspected devices were attached to two separate propane tanks. Two of the devices were placed near the front entrance of the residence and two additional devices were placed near the rear entrance; all four devices were rigged to detonate.


  “Amidst the pandemic, the brave men and women of law enforcement continue to risk life and limb to keep our communities safe,” U.S. Attorney Kennedy said in a release. “With knives, guns, and 10 bombs — one of which was detonated, and nine of which were inside a house located in a crowded residential area — the danger this individual presented cannot be understated. As our tremendous medical professionals — and each of us — focus efforts on doing everything possible to defeat the invisible enemy, our law enforcement professionals remain vigilant to ensure that our fight may continue and that the enemies amongst us can do us no harm. All of our protectors are worthy of our praise and gratitude.”


  Assistant U.S. Attorney Seth T. Molisani is prosecuting the case.


  The complaint is the result of an investigation by the New York State Police, under the direction of Major James Hall; the Niagara Falls Police Department, under the direction of Superintendent Thomas Licata; the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, under the direction of Special Agent-in- Charge John B.

President Trump, who has been fast to criticize, can deal it out but he can't take it. He and some of his supporters get criticized because they don't have a grip on the facts.


  Trump's supporters have dismissed his intent to cut the CDC budget. The CDC budget would have been cut every year he has been in office. But Congress put most cuts back.


  Trump did not completely end travel to and from China early but shut it down three weeks after the virus's start. An epidemiologist wrote the "cow was already out of the barn."


  For two months Trump told us there was no worry at all about a pandemic and everything was under control. At a rally Trump said someone told him the virus was the "'Democrats' new hoax.'"


  Trump also told us the virus "like a miracle, will disappear," and "go away." "We're doing a great job with it ... "


  Great job? Hospitals are still short of important supplies.


  So, while some people cling to their Bibles and AK-47s, I pray they look at the facts or question their own motives before they call anything unAmerican. Trump needs to stop name calling, complaining that Democrats have always been out to get him, and deal with the facts. Get a grip.

Consumers who need access to credit during coronavirus crisis and other emergencies faced a very close call this week when some in Congress tried to sneak a provision into the COVID-19 economic rescue package that would have limited options for consumer cash and credit at the worst possible time. Policymakers who understand the devastating impact so-called rate caps have on workers and families ensured the coronavirus rescue package did not include one.


  While consumers were spared for the moment, as Congress considers additional initiatives to rescue the U.S. economy, it’s clear Speaker Nancy Pelosi and House progressives will not, to paraphrase Rahm Emanuel, let the global COVID-19 crisis go to waste.


  Speaker Pelosi and her followers doubled down on legislative proposals full of billions of dollars of handouts and subsidies, despite intense criticism for their previous bloated, bailout-rich coronavirus “relief” packages, now known as #coronapork. Members of Congress, analysts, watchdog groups and many others sounded the alarm about giveaways to special interests and progressive pet projects such as the Green New Deal, the USPS, student debt forgiveness and financial “reform” wish list items that would hurt the very consumers their supporters claim they want to help.


  I wrote last month about how the American public is being deceived into supporting leftist consumer lending policies under the guise of “military and veteran protections,” and true to form, House Financial Services Committee progressives tried unsuccessfully to sneak this pet financial services initiative into the COVID-19 response package. Senate Banking Democrats proposed a “Coronavirus Relief” 36% rate cap on all consumer loans, while the House version would cripple non-bank lenders by prohibiting them from collecting money from borrowers for months.


  California has been one of the hardest hit states in the nation with the coronavirus. Thousands of COVID-19 cases have been confirmed and dozens have tragically died. Unfortunately, for consumers in the Golden State, a new state rate-cap law went into effect earlier this year that will severely restrict their access to credit at one of the worst possible moments. With government- mandated stay-at-home orders, a majority of employers are banned from opening their doors, and workers ready and able to work are banned from working.

The soil is arguably the most valuable and misunderstood resource on our farms and property. Give back to the soil and it will give back to you. Farmers have long been aware of this relationship, and in turn they continue to be great stewards of the complex ecosystem beneath our feet.


   


  To have a glimpse into this underground world, we recommend producers take soil samples periodically. Soil samples allow us to monitor various changes within the soil including fertility, chemistry, density and more. Sampling is the first step in making any kind of fertility management decisions. Knowing what your soil requires before planting a crop is a critical component in maximizing economic returns and limiting wasted resources.


   


  Annual soil sampling is recommended in most crops; however sampling only every two or three years in pastures and forage may be feasible depending on the level of intensity you want to manage your fields with.


   


  It takes nutrients to grow all parts of a plant. Therefore, any time plants or grain are harvested and removed from the field, you are removing some nutrients from the field as well.


   


  We have naturally acidic soils here in North Carolina, so pH is something that you will want to keep an eye on. If the pH is lowering, then the soil is becoming more acidic. The optimum pH will vary depending on the crop or plant you want to grow. Among other things, fertilizers containing ammonium will begin to acidify the soil when applied, so lime is commonly used to raise the pH of the soil back to the desired range.


   


  The three nutrients that plants use most from the soil is nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium. Therefore, it makes sense that these nutrients would require more maintenance than all the other plant-essential nutrients. There are 17 plant-essential nutrients, each of which is just as critical for proper growth as the other. A plant can only grow as much as the most limiting factor will allow. The one and only way to make sure all of your plant-essential nutrients are at an adequate level is by taking a soil sample.


   


  To take a sample effectively, the North Carolina Department of Agriculture suggests taking 12-15 cores per sample area. That means each field should have 12-15 spots where you take a subsample. Take and thoroughly mix those cores, or subsamples, into a plastic bucket before putting them into one sample box that will be sent to the lab for analysis. Each sample box should represent one sample area, or field.


   


  There are a lot of things to consider when taking a soil sample. In fact, the greatest source of error occurs when the sample is being taken, not at the lab when being analyzed. To be sure we are taking samples correctly, the NC Cooperative Extension in Randolph County will be offering a Soil Sample Short Course where producers can stay up to date on sampling techniques, understand the economic benefits and fine tune their sampling strategy based on their individual farm situation.


   


  For the Short Course participants, you will have a chance to receive one of 19 soil probes valued at over $60 a piece. The soil probe prize is restricted to Randolph County residents due to the nature of the grant that funded the purchase.


   


  We have set the Soil Sample Short Course to be in July. If you are interested, call 336-318-6000 or email randolphcoopext@ncsu.edu, and we will contact you with further details.

Melissa Malone's young daughter recently asked her if there would be peaches for the family to pick this year.


  At first, the question puzzled Malone, Natick's town administrator.


  "Although an odd question as to whether we'll have peaches seems to come out of left field, it really isn't because her whole world has been upended," Malone said. "It's difficult conceptually for people to deal with something that is so radically different, and that includes children and professionals."


  Malone has been scrambling over the past few weeks to begin planning for the ballooning impacts of the new coronavirus on Natick's town budget.


  Roughly four days into the spiraling crisis, it became clear to her that Natick needed to prepare for long-term, potentially significant losses that, without swift action, could limit the town's ability to serve its more than 35,000 residents.


  Malone said Natick will likely lose about $4.3 million in local taxes and fees, including revenue from restaurants and hotels, in the current fiscal year alone, a drop she called "exponential and dramatic." But she expects those losses are only the beginning of a fiscal crisis she described as the most difficult moment of her career.


  "This is a 180 day-plus event, and that is what we need to plan for," she said. "And I didn't make that number up. That is the number in looking at what was happening on the other side of the globe that seemed reasonable. That, I think, is what we have to plan for."


  Malone has already begun talking to department heads in Natick about what can be cut from the budget for the next fiscal year, which begins July 1. Plans to hire more police officers and Department of Public Works employees are now on hold.


  "We're doing a full-scope review of all of our departments so that we can make sure that we're finding every savings possible," she said.


  A few weeks into the coronavirus crisis, several municipal finance officials in the area said the pandemic could have a sizable impact on municipal budgets, which fund everything from schools to first responders to economic development. Many are already planning cuts and considering when they might need to dip into rainy day funds.


  "I think ultimately what taxpayers and residents care about is services," said Michael Herbert, Ashland's town manager, "making sure that we're providing the services that you expect out of a full-service municipality, and that you're moving forward and creating the type of community that people have expressed that they want, in terms of things like community development projects."


  Ashland is in the process of designing and engineering a new public safety building and school, and while design plans for those projects remain ongoing, the town is forecasting significant revenue losses that could impact projects like those down the road.


  The new coronavirus hit just as cities and towns were finalizing their budgets for next year, and while Ashland has not yet adjusted its fiscal 2021 budget, Herbert and Finance Director Brittany Iacaponi are planning to revisit the budget to see if it should be revised in coming weeks.


  "I think people need to understand that if budgets get bad enough, that we then have to start looking at reductions in municipal services," Herbert said. "Now, we're in a fortunate position right now where that's not being considered. I know a lot of other communities are already talking about having to do that. But if this thing continues and things get bad enough, we do have to look at a reduction of services."


  Most municipalities in the area are expecting less state aid and lower revenues in local taxes, some of which come from residents coping with layoffs or reduced hours.


  Framingham has already decided to waive interest and penalties on late payments from taxpayers, an effort to relieve financial pressure on residents who have been most affected. Waiving those fees will result in about a $100,000 loss this fiscal year, and about a $200,000 loss in the next one.


  Cities and towns are also coping with additional expenses related to the new coronavirus. Framingham has already spent about $40,000 on technology needed to support remote work for municipal employees and officials, as well as additional expenditures for public health and safety, Chief Financial Officer MaryEllen Kelley told the Daily News on Friday.


  Both Framingham and Ashland have now created spending codes and accounts specifically for coronavirus-related costs using guidance from the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency, or MEMA, which put together a list of coronavirus-related expenses that would be eligible for reimbursement.


  Expenses on the lengthy list include emergency operation center-related costs, vaccinations for survivors and emergency workers to prevent outbreaks, durable medical equipment, child care and mass mortuary services.


  Cities and towns are starting to receive grants from the state Department of Public Health to offset coronavirus costs -- $200,000 to Framingham, $6,700 to Ashland, $13,000 to Natick -- and while the relief funds are helpful, Malone said they likely won't be enough.


  "At this point, I don't have a dollar amount that I can say that I'm expecting to receive, and while we're very appreciative of every dollar, I still think we're going to have to go through this exercise of looking through every budget to see what we can find because I don't think that that will be sufficient to cover all of our costs," Malone said.


  Many municipal finance professionals are looking for a reference point as they start to prepare for a crisis that is still unfolding.


  While any data is helpful at this point, most officials said this moment differs greatly from what happened in 2008.


  Herbert said the new coronavirus seems to be a bottom-up crisis, where job losses in parts of the economy like the service industry are causing reverberations on Wall Street, a scenario he described as "kind of like the reverse" of the 2008 economic downturn.


  "We were actually prepared, I think, for a downturn that would even approach 2008 levels, at least on the municipal side," Herbert said. "But this is something like we haven't seen before."


  In Natick, town officials have begun scouring the Town Hall basement for files that would show how the 9/11 terrorist attacks impacted the town.


  "Again, it's not going to be perfect, but we do recognize that there's great things and thought that can come from reviewing the history of what's happened," Malone said.


  Not all cities and towns are sounding the alarm bells that Malone is. Some municipal leaders say that while they are watching the coronavirus crisis closely, they have not yet started to plan for the long-term impacts that Malone and others are preparing for.


  "It's important that people be thinking about this stuff, but to be cutting budgets or making decisions like that in the heat of this emergency, in my opinion, is premature," said Northborough Town Administrator John Coderre. "Any drastic moves at this stage would be, in my opinion, an uninformed knee- jerk reaction."


  Interim Hopedale Town Administrator Robert Reed, like Coderre, said he's focused on immediate emergency management.


  "At present, I don't think it's going to be a huge economic impact," Reed said. "We're trying to conduct business as usual."

“I looked at the major candidates,” she says. “Gov. Kemp’s appointee, Kelly Loeffler, is from Illinois, not Georgia, and owns the stock exchange. She is not one of us.” (Actually, it is her husband who owns it, but you get her point.)


  As for Doug Collins, Taylor says, “He is from Gainesville and a lot of powerful politicians come from there. I am a South Georgia girl. I represent the average Georgian. I am not wealthy. I live on a budget. I pay taxes and don’t look for loopholes. Most of all, there are not a lot of young working- class Republicans running for office. I want to change that.”


  Dr. Taylor is having difficulty finding out who the real enemy is. “I have voted Republican all my life,” she says, “and, yet, I am not a part of the ‘establishment.’ I am an outsider. I find it hard to get my calls returned and questions answered by the powers-that-be. When I was in Atlanta qualifying for the race, Fox5 TV showed interest in talking to me about the idea of an outsider running for the Senate but then they suddenly backed out.” She wonders if someone got to the station and put the kibosh on the interview.


  As with everything on earth these days, the coronavirus has had an impact on campaigning. “I am using social media at this point,” she says, “and plan to be able to get around the state later and meet my fellow Georgians. They will see then who I am.” She hopes to gain the support of her fellow educators around the state. “I can’t think of anyone better than a middle-class educator raised in Georgia to represent our state,” she asserts.


  Her campaign platform is true-red Republican: Pro 2nd Amendment (“I have my pistol with me at all times, unless I am at school.”) Pro-Trump. Pro-life and a major emphasis on helping Georgia’s farmers. “Georgia’s farmers don’t want bailouts. They want to be paid a fair price for their commodity. Cotton prices are so low, the farmers can barely afford to grow it. Seed prices are significantly higher than in other states.” When I reminded her that Secretary of Agriculture George E. Perdue is a Georgian, she shot back, “And what has he done for our farmers?” Good question.


  I didn’t have the heart to tell her just how long her long-shot chances are. But Kandiss Taylor wouldn’t believe me, anyway. This is one underdog eager to race the political thoroughbreds.

  An investigation into the perpetrator(s) who flooded the Zoom chat room connected to the first virtual Salem City Council meeting convened in the new social-distancing era is under investigation, more than one Salem councilor said on Friday.


  For nearly five minutes, post after post laced with hate-filled speech popped up on the chat room immediately after the City Council President Robert McCarthy gaveled the public meeting to order Thursday night at 7 p.m.


  Ward 5 Councilor Josh Turiel said the chat function was enabled, so people logged into the public meeting could not only view the chat room posts but also freely comment add their own. Going forward, officials say, the chat functions have been disabled for public meetings held on the virtual platform.


  Posts in the thread included anti-Semitic, racist and derogatory language aimed at members of the 11-member council, from attacking their likeness and religions to throwing out wholly inappropriate profanity and accusations.


  "Some people are horrible," said Turiel. "It'd be delightful to identify and shame them."


  A return address


  Ward 4 Councilor Tim Flynn, whose name posters singled out, said the vulgarity and level hate upsetting.


  "It was disgusting to see the chats that were coming up on the thread," said Flynn. "I hope these individuals are tracked down by the police department."


  The individual(s) identified themselves as Ben Jarlstone, Natt Zilovar and Dylan Write - which appear to be fabricated names. Turiel said they retrieved the unique Internet protocol addresses connected to the electronic devices the perpetrators allegedly used to push out comments onto the chat room on Thursday. According to Google, an IP address identifies an electronic device on the Internet, like a return address written in the upper-left corner of a mailed envelope - which they will use in this case, Turiel said.


  At-Large Councilor Conrad Prosniewski said that none of the panelists responded as the incident unfolded over a nearly five-minute period impressed him.


  "No one batted an eye or paid attention to it," said Prosniewski on Friday evening. "We just dismissed it."


  Prosniewski, who retired from a 41-year-career as a Salem police office in 2019, identified the behavior as "most definitely criminal."


  'Not who we are'


  Even though councilors convened the public meeting on Thursday over a virtual platform, Prosniewski said it was still legally wrapped in all the bells and whistles of one staged in a public place.


  "You can't just burst the doors open to or stand up in the council chambers and start spewing stuff like that," said Prosniewski, adding there is no difference here.


  Local law enforcement could arrest and charge the perpetrator(s) for not only obscene and profane language in a public place but also, Prosniewski said, "disturbing a public meeting," specifically an assembly of people meeting for a lawful purpose.


  Moreover, Prosniewski said he beleives law enforcement could pursue a civil rights violation because the unlawful action of "disturbing a public meeting was clearly motivated by bias and hate."


  The at-large councilor added: "What happened last night is not right and does not represent our city."


  Salem No Place For Hate Committee Co-Chair Jeff Cohen quickly condemned the hate speech and behavior, too, over the phone on Friday afternoon,


  "This just shows how people will use online access to spread hate," he said. "Any type of hate speech made in person or online we all need to minimize and educate people about why this is not who we are."

KEITHVILLE, La. (AP) " For more than 20 years, Susan and Wayne Nichols shared a prayer that the questions surrounding an infant boy who was found dead after being discarded in a trash bag would be answered.
 Wayne found the child after he witnessed a stray dog bury it between the beams at a structural steel fabrication plant where he worked in March 1999.
 The event changed both of their lives, giving them a stronger call to help others, Susan recalled. Wayne died just before his 65th birthday in late 2019. After finding the infant, he became a full-time firefighter and spent the remainder of his career in fire emergency service. Susan, who was a volunteer firefighter at the time, now works as a deputy emergency communications officer at the DeSoto Parish Sheriff's Office.
 'You know, hopefully, something can break and they can, you know, find out who it is and just put the case to rest. Because the fact that the case is cold and, you know, and that nothing has been found or done is, you know, I don't know. It's like the baby still can't rest in peace," Susan said.
 "It's our prayer. It's been Wayne's and it's mine as well. Hopefully, the case can be resolved," she continued.
 FRIDAY, MARCH 26, 1999
 Workers of a structural steel fabrication plant of Kenneth Salley Enterprises Inc. dodged a black-plastic bag near the center line of the road on their way to work, in the 11600 block of Old Mansfield Road. It wasn't uncommon for unwanted animals and trash to be left on that stretch of road, according to workers in a previous report.
 But around noon that day, Wayne, a welder, was on lunch break and saw a stray dog with something in his mouth. His first thought was that the dog may have a chicken or something, he told The Times in a 1999 report.
 The dog was on the other side of the road, so it was unclear. As the dog approached the plant's yard, Nichols then thought it could possibly be a baby.
 He followed the dog toward stacks of rusty, steel beams and then watched the dog emerge from the stacks, no longer carrying anything. Wayne notified the office to call the sheriff's department and was joined by a few other workers to search for what the dog may have left behind.
 Another worker found what appeared to be a small hand sticking up between two beams. All but the child's hand was buried in the ground.
 Deputies arrived on the scene soon after.
 The baby was estimated to be no older than just a few days old. Bloody newspapers and towels were also found by investigators, but his head was missing.
 'It affected my husband, of course, terribly for a long time. He, um, he would have nightmares, he would, um...," Susan said, taking a brief pause while attempting to contain her emotions.
 "There was a couple of times he was driving down the road and he would see like a, um, he would, he would see something on the side of the road or (he) would see a trash bag, you know, and he'd have a reaction and flash back to it," she continued.
 THE INVESTIGATION
 Caddo Sheriff deputies captured the dog and it was later euthanized so its stomach contents could be analyzed. Inside the dog's stomach appeared to be skull and cap, and some facial tissues, The Times previously reported.
 Local hospitals were checked to see if the mother showed for medical attention.
 At the beginning of the investigation, the baby was estimated to have been less than a day old. But later news reports said that he was probably about two to three days old. The child's umbilical cord was still attached.
 There was also uncertainty on whether the baby was black or white; if whether the baby was alive when his head was decapitated; the possibility that the child wasn't born alive due to the condition of the remains; and what removed the child's head.
 Investigators now believe the baby is white, and that he was alive when born.
 DNA was taken from the scene. The blood on the newspaper and towels were determined to not belong to the infant, but possibly the mother. This DNA information was put into the FBI's Combined DNA Index System (CODIS), but there were no matches.
 The case was reopened last May. Caddo Sheriff's detective Jeremy Prudhome has considered the possibility, among many, of the mother being a young girl at the time. He has followed up with individuals who were pregnant or young mothers then and checking on what happened to their children.
 He also talked with longtime residents.
 'They remember it happening, but they don't remember anything as far as hearing about anybody that was involved," he told The Times in a previous report.

It only took a single text message for the sewing team at Brian's Custom Sports to join the fight against the spread of COVID-19.


  The goalie equipment manufacturer had been approached by Windsor-Essex County medical officials on Tuesday for their surplus of double-sided tape and foam — key elements of medical face shields — but were then asked what their production capabilities were for medical gowns.


  As a non-essential business, Brian's had sent its staff home, but a short text message from the human resources department got an immediate response from the 16-person sewing team.


  "Within minutes, they're all basically on board," said Joe Aitken, director of sales and marketing for Brian's Custom Sports, on Saturday. "Part of it is the ability to keep working. The other part is the fact that you're helping for the greater good."


  Before Aitken's team could return to the Kingsville, Ont., plant, some logistics had to be worked out. Brian's had no pattern for the 18,000 medical gowns they had committed to making, so one was brought from a local hospital and was carefully taken apart to reverse-engineer a template.


  Making sure the sewing equipment would work was also an important step as Brian's Custom Sports uses heavy-duty machines designed to punch through the thick padding and faux-leather of goalie equipment and not the thinner repurposed bed sheets they had been sent to make the gowns from.


  Brian's normally produces equipment for NHL goalies including Thatcher Demko of the Vancouver Canucks, Robin Lehner of the Vegas Golden Knights, and Jaroslav Halak of the Boston Bruins.


  Linus Ullmark, a goalie with the Buffalo Sabres organization, was one of the first to like Brian's Instagram post about the change in production even though he's not a client.

  The soil is arguably the most valuable and misunderstood resource on our farms and property. Give back to the soil and it will give back to you. Farmers have long been aware of this relationship, and in turn they continue to be great stewards of the complex ecosystem beneath our feet.


  To have a glimpse into this underground world, we recommend producers take soil samples periodically. Soil samples allow us to monitor various changes within the soil including fertility, chemistry, density and more. Sampling is the first step in making any kind of fertility management decisions. Knowing what your soil requires before planting a crop is a critical component in maximizing economic returns and limiting wasted resources.


  Annual soil sampling is recommended in most crops; however sampling only every two or three years in pastures and forage may be feasible depending on the level of intensity you want to manage your fields with.


  It takes nutrients to grow all parts of a plant. Therefore, any time plants or grain are harvested and removed from the field, you are removing some nutrients from the field as well.


  We have naturally acidic soils here in North Carolina, so pH is something that you will want to keep an eye on. If the pH is lowering, then the soil is becoming more acidic. The optimum pH will vary depending on the crop or plant you want to grow. Among other things, fertilizers containing ammonium will begin to acidify the soil when applied, so lime is commonly used to raise the pH of the soil back to the desired range.


  The three nutrients that plants use most from the soil is nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium. Therefore, it makes sense that these nutrients would require more maintenance than all the other plant-essential nutrients. There are 17 plant-essential nutrients, each of which is just as critical for proper growth as the other. A plant can only grow as much as the most limiting factor will allow. The one and only way to make sure all of your plant-essential nutrients are at an adequate level is by taking a soil sample.


  To take a sample effectively, the North Carolina Department of Agriculture suggests taking 12-15 cores per sample area. That means each field should have 12-15 spots where you take a subsample. Take and thoroughly mix those cores, or subsamples, into a plastic bucket before putting them into one sample box that will be sent to the lab for analysis. Each sample box should represent one sample area, or field.


  There are a lot of things to consider when taking a soil sample. In fact, the greatest source of error occurs when the sample is being taken, not at the lab when being analyzed. To be sure we are taking samples correctly, the NC Cooperative Extension in Randolph County will be offering a Soil Sample Short Course where producers can stay up to date on sampling techniques, understand the economic benefits and fine tune their sampling strategy based on their individual farm situation.


  For the Short Course participants, you will have a chance to receive one of 19 soil probes valued at over $60 a piece. The soil probe prize is restricted to Randolph County residents due to the nature of the grant that funded the purchase.


  We have set the Soil Sample Short Course to be in July. If you are interested, call 336-318-6000 or email randolphcoopext@ncsu.edu, and we will contact you with further details.


  Blake Szilva is the Field Crop/Forestry Extension Agent and Pesticide Coordinator for th NC Cooperative Extension in Randolph County.
