Though it was later revealed that it was a task of a lone wolf, a resident of India-Occupied Kashmir (IoK), but government of India retaliated by first revoking Pakistan’s most favoured nation status, then increased customs duty on Pakistani goods by 200%, and also urged the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF) to put Pakistan in their blacklist. Not satisfied with all these steps, India raised the ante and twelve Indian Air Force (IAF) jets crossed the LoC and dropped bombs onto Balakot. Luckily there was no damage, other than a few trees, yet it was a provocation Pakistan public could not take lying down. And when the IAF jets tried to crossover LoC again the next day, were intercepted and in a dog fight two were shot down by Pakistan Air Force. One of the jets fell towards Pakistan’s side of LoC and its pilot was captured alive. Pakistan, however, showed magnanimity and the captured Indian pilot was returned to India. But Indian Government of Narendra Modi was not ready to let peace prevail.

Open-book exams test your ability to quickly find relevant information and then to understand, analyse, apply knowledge and think critically. Exams of this type don’t test your memory only but test also your ability to find and use information for problem solving, and to deliver well-structured and well- presented arguments and solutions. The style of question depends on the level of degree and subject. Probably the biggest misconception about open-book exams is that there is no need to study. You should study just as you would for any other exam so that you would become able to apply it effectively.

War clouds are looming in Asia where three nuclear armed neighbors are looking each other in the eyes because of the actions directly instigated by Narendra Modi’s short sightedness. Let’s not forget what he said earlier this year about India forcing Pakistan “bite the dust” in less than 10 days. Similar noises are also being heard from top Indian military leadership that are floating the doctrine of war on two fronts. The world community must take cognizance about the irresponsible policies/actions of the BJP Government that are increasingly imperilling regional peace and stability. It is high time that Kashmir issue be resolved as per the wishes of Kashmiri people under the auspices of UNSC to ensure long lasting peace in South Asia. We owe this much to our younger generation who would otherwise blame us for taking no action when war clouds were looming over Asia threatening the world peace.

Federal Minister added that during the appointment of pilots, merit is ignored. It goes without saying that the diminished level of credibility and trust on the national airline displayed from the public and the international community is the state’s own doing. How is the airline even trusting irreplaceable human lives in the hands of inexperienced pilots without conducting due security clearance? This poses a humongous question mark on the level and severity of accountability by the state and other regulatory bodies.

Media reports in the UK have been alleging private airlines’ meddling in derailing country’s rail development plans. They don’t allow train services to run. UK’s HS2 or high speed train project is stalled for a decade. Its price has increased to £150bn which forced government to reduce its size to bring the expenditure to £100bn rendering it useless as it no more connects the country as planned originally. Despite promise in December 2019, Johnson has not given progress report to the nation. It is true for the UK’s rooftop renewable energy programs as big oil and utility companies block its progress despite approval of bank loans. No wonder renewable energy policy is delivering in Pakistan with God Speed as public bears more than 12 hours loadshedding at the hands of privatized companies. It takes two to tango!
