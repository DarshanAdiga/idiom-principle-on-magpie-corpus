US prosecutors and attorneys for Britain's Prince Andrew sniped at one another across the Atlantic on Monday, each saying the other side was to blame for the duke's failure to participate in the Jeffrey Epstein sex trafficking probe.
 Andrew's lawyers said in a statement that he has offered three times this year to speak with US investigators after being assured that he "is not and has never been a 'target' of their criminal investigations into Epstein."
 That offer, though, came with a request that "our co-operation and any interview arrangements would remain confidential," said the firm Blackfords LLP in London.
 "Unfortunately, the DOJ has reacted to the first two offers by breaching their own confidentiality rules and claiming that the Duke has offered zero cooperation. In doing so, they are perhaps seeking publicity rather than accepting the assistance proffered," the lawyers said.
 Hours later, the US attorney in Manhattan, Geoffrey S. Berman, issued a statement saying the prince had tried to "falsely portray himself to the public as eager and willing to cooperate" even as he repeatedly declined to schedule an interview.
 "If Prince Andrew is, in fact, serious about cooperating with the ongoing federal investigation, our doors remain open, and we await word of when we should expect him," Berman said.
 Berman's statement addressed only Prince Andrew's willingness to be interviewed. It made no mention of the claims by his lawyers that the Department of Justice had advised them that Andrew is not a target of the investigation, or that they made any promise that whatever he told investigators would be confidential.
 Before Monday, Berman had said that Andrew has provided "zero cooperation" to American investigators.
 Epstein killed himself in a US jail last summer as he awaited trial on sex trafficking charges.
 One of the women who was sexually abused by Epstein as a teenager, Virginia Roberts Giuffre, has claimed that the financier flew her around the world on private planes to have sex with powerful men, and that she had sexual encounters with Andrew in London and New York, starting when she was 17.
 Andrew denies the allegation.
 The contrasting views of what is going on behind the scenes came after The Sun newspaper and other media organizations reported that the US Department of Justice had submitted a mutual legal assistance request to Britain's Home Office. Such requests are used in criminal cases under a treaty and are generally used when material can't be obtained on a police cooperation basis.
 US investigators are still examining potential criminality by Epstein's associates. Multiple women have said the financier had helpers who recruited underage girls into a network of sexual servants.
 Andrew's help is being sought as a witness, his lawyers said.
 "Far from our client acting above the law, as has been implied by press briefings in the US, he is being treated by a lower standard than might reasonably be expected for any other citizen,'' Blackfords said. "Further, those same breaches of confidentiality by the DOJ have given the global media - and, therefore, the worldwide audience - an entirely misleading account of our discussions with them."

The media ran with the story. The company’s stock value zoomed up even though Moderna has yet to sell any products. The public was left with the message that maybe a vaccine was right around the corner. But is it?
 Readers and listeners need to be on the lookout for clues to the real story right now.
 Helen Branswell, a veteran reporter I know who has covered other disease outbreaks and knows her stuff, penned a cautionary message for STAT News where she now works. She wrote, “While Moderna blitzed the media, it revealed very little information, and most of what it did disclose were words, not data. With science, numbers speak louder than words.”
 I reached Branswell by phone to chat about how people should judge the studies, the claims, and the wishful thinking that will surely come until a new medication has been discovered that will tame the virus.
 First off, the public needs to understand that all clinical trials are not created equal. A Phase 1 trial that Moderna reported is just the first step in the process. These trials are usually small with no expectation there will be data about how effective a drug will be. Instead, Branswell pointed out, such a trial is “really about establishing a dose to make sure it’s safe enough to keep going.
 In a Phase 2 trial, which may enroll a few hundred people, researchers are looking for efficacy and safety signals that tell them whether it makes sense to continue and whether the result may be an effective vaccine for humans.
 Phase 3 trials are the gold standard. They are usually large and double blind. That means half of the participants receive the trial vaccine and the other half a placebo. Neither the participants nor the researchers know which half is which until the end of the trial. It’s generally best to look for how well a new drug performed in a Phase 3 trial with results published in a peer- reviewed journal where experts have scrutinized the data.

Lois Geist Depp passed away peacefully from this world in which she lived so happily for over 88 years on May 22, 2020. She was in the comforting physical and virtual presence of her two daughters.      Lois was born and raised in Punxsutawney in the loving home of George and Wilda (Justice) Geist.      She was a graduate of Punxsutawney High School, and received her B. M.Ed. from the Shenandoah Conservatory of Music in 1953, and M. Ed, in Music Education from Penn State University in 1975.      She and her husband, the late Elvin "Joe" Depp, were high school sweethearts. They met at the First Evangelical United Brethren Church (now Woodland Avenue United Methodist Church) and after their marriage in 1952 began their life journey together in Punxsutawney.      They moved to Altoona in 1961, where Lois actualized her calling as an educator and made a lasting imprint on generations of public school students. She was first appointed to the Altoona Area School District as a kindergarten teacher in 1963, in 1966 was hired as a vocal music teacher and retired in 1991 as the Music and Art Supervisor.      Lois also used her musical gifts to lead church choirs in a number of congregations throughout her career, which in Punxsutawney included the church on Woodland Avenue, and in Altoona, the Fairview United Methodist Church and Bethany Lutheran Church.      She moved to Plattdeutsche Retirement Community in Franklin Square, New York, in 2014 to be nearer to family.      Lois will be fondly remembered by her family and friends for her kind spirit, unwavering faith in God, belief that there is good in every person, and perhaps most of all, for her ability to make each one of us feel like they were her favorite.      Lois was preceded in death by her beloved husband with whom she shared more than 53 years of marriage.      Her memory will be cherished and kept alive by her daughters, Cheryl Pal of Baldwin, New York, and Lissa Olbeter of Paso Robles, California; four grandchildren; five great-grandchildren; extended family and many dear friends.

Good to see protesters now have some proposals - at least as to some police practices. On my phone, the link to "8 cant wait" is not getting me to specific proposals. But I'll throw in 2 cents worth anyway to kick off the discussion. Most cities around here have police policies and procedures online. Whether changing a policy or procedure might matter would depend on many things including the consequences, if any, of breaches. As to the use of deadly force by an officer, for example, the basic law is that officers may use any force apparently necessary to get the job done. That job might be making an arrest - even for a minor offense. Some departments place restrictions on methods. For example, suppose a drunk driver flees in his Tesla at 120 mph. Some departments tell officers not to pursue at 120 mph. But if the drunk driver has an abducted child in the car, there could be a Plan B. How about always saying "drop the gun or I'll shoot." You see it on police tv dramas. Saying that to a suspect pointing his gun at an officer or at a hostage may get them killed. How about telling a terrorist, "drop your submachine gun or I'll shoot." That could kill a dozen officers. How about a choke hold? A dangerous compliance technique. But you would not want to policy or law that says officers can never use choke holds. That would include a struggle with a suspect for a gun. The suspect could choke the officer but not vice-a-versa. I am just suggesting proposed changes be carefully considered and written.

On Friday, Athletic Director David Jones made the call to Davis that he would succeed longtime coach Brian Young, who retired after 25 years at the helm of the Antlers’ boys program.
 It’s a somewhat incredible fact, because it’s hard to believe that Davis has lived anywhere except Kerrville. Ever since he arrived in the Hill Country, he’s become a beloved figure in the community. He started as a student coach for Young, and quickly became Tivy’s top assistant.
 “I was blessed to get hired from the district after graduation,” Davis said. “It was pretty awesome.”
 He received another awesome opportunity in 2010, when he left Tivy for his first head coaching job at Van Vleck — a class 3A program. He was successful there; the Leopards never missed the playoffs during his three-year tenure.
 However, his heart was in Kerrville. In 2014, he came back to Tivy to rejoin Young’s staff. He also had a teaching job at Peterson Middle School, where he teaches health.
 His wife Liberty Davis also attended Schriener, playing basketball and softball. The couple wanted to raise their three children in Kerrville, chiefly because Kerrville is home. Joe Davis said he loves Tivy, his coaching colleagues and his players. It’s a mutual feeling.
 “He pours his heart and soul into the game and into the program,” former Tivy basketball player Will Johnston said. “It’s evident at all times that he is doing what he loves. And he does it well. … Everyone just has a whole lot of respect for him, on and off the court.

Justice needs to be brought to Derek Chauvin, but he is not the only one responsible. The other police officers who were on the scene are also responsible. Why didn’t they do anything?

They chose not to use good judgment and common sense or to enact the aim and purpose of their police profession which is to protect and serve. Courage is acting even when you are afraid.

KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) — Malaysian authorities detained 269 Rohingya refugees and found a body on board a suspected smuggling boat they said had been intentionally damaged so it couldn't be turned back to sea. How long the Rohingya were at sea and where they came from were not disclosed. Hundreds of thousands of ethnic Muslim Rohingya have fled Myanmar due to a military crackdown and many live in densely crowded refugee camps in Bangladesh. Muslim-dominated Malaysia has been a common destination of boats arranged by traffickers who promise the refugees a better life abroad. Malaysian marine officials intercepted the vessel Monday off the northern resort island of Langkawi, the National Task Force said in a statement. It said 53 people who jumped off the boat and tried to swim ashore were detained, another 216 were detained from the boat and the body of a woman was found on board. Malaysian officials had intended to turn the boat away, but it had been purposely damaged with its engine beyond repair. The refugees were fed and placed in a temporary detention facility, while the body has been handed over to police for investigation, the statement said. The National Task Force said 396 people attempting to sneak into the country illegally have been detained since May, along with 108 boat skippers and 11 suspected smugglers. It said 22 boats with some 140 immigrants trying to enter the county illegally have also been turned away since May. It didn't give details on the nationality of the migrants. The count didn't include a boat carrying some 200 Rohingya refugees, including children, that was turned away in April for fear the refugees may bring the coronavirus into the country.

Federal Communications Commission member Jonathan Adelstein made an impassioned plea for more tests on the consumer impact of dropping analog-TV broadcasting, including praise for an Oct. 28 test planned in New York, speaking to an Advertising Week session.
 “Here in New York City on Oct. 28, they are going to do a soft cutoff, and everybody is participating that can,” said Adelstein, a Democrat on the FCC. He provided no details.
 Adelstein lauded ION Media Networks chairman and CEO Brandon Burgess for spearheading a previously announced drive for a series of soft local tests over mid- and late October to prepare for consumer distress for the Feb. 17, 2009, hard cutoff nationally.
 “Planning, I think, has been disappointing to say the least” in government, he said. He cited education efforts not highlighting that lower-power TV stations will continue telecasting and said little thought has been given to the dangers of repositioning rooftop antenna in the snow belt, since the national cutoff date is in the middle of winter.
 “Nobody’s ultimately responsible for vetting or prioritizing the ideas from both public and private sector into a concrete, comprehensive and coherent plan,” Adelstein asserted. “While our [FCC] staff has been hard at work and despite some recent improvements, our overall DTV effort is not a model of effectiveness.”
 One reason why he worries is that he feels that the soft test in Wilmington, N.C., Sept. 8 was misinterpreted as a success. He said projecting Wilmington’s 2,272 consumer calls seeking help in the first week to a national cutoff translates to 2.2 million such calls. “And that’s an optimistic scenario,” he added, because the Wilmington test had more manpower and in-market education than the national cutoff.
 “While we can take small comfort in what went smoothly, we should fear what didn’t,” he said. “There is no plan remotely comparable for that kind of outreach nationwide … I think the FCC is continuing to underestimate the task ahead.”
 Adelstein was welcomed by _Broadcasting & Cable_ publisher Larry Dunn and Promax/BDA president Jonathan Block-Verk. Promax/BDA and _B &C_ sponsored the session.

"We have CPR training every two years, but as far as for animals and the ones we have rescued in the past, we usually put oxygen on them and do chest compressions," said Baker.
 Baker said there are no special oxygen masks for animals, other than the oneS used for humans.
 According to the American Red Cross, the best practice for protecting pets is to include them in the family plan.
 "This includes having their own disaster supplies kit, as well as arranging in advance for a safe place for them to stay if you need to leave your home," ARC said. "When you practice your escape plan, practice taking your pets with you and train them to come to you when you call."
 Baker said pet owners can make it easier on everyone –including firefighters – if they remain calm and pay attention to where an animal is, if still inside.
 "It doesn't do anybody any good at all if we, the firemen, don't know what we're looking for, and we go in and we're searching the whole house when we could go straight into the one room and get animals," he said. "It helps us when we get there if they tell us exactly which room and where they could be, and it makes it easier and faster to make a rescue."
 ARC advises pets should be kept in areas or rooms near entrances where firefighters can easily find them when they are home alone.
 Alexis Colvard, Humane Society of Cherokee County transport coordinator, said there are many ways a pet owner can make preparations.
 “Provide shelter, shade, and water, if you’re going to keep your animals outside – especially in this heat,” said Colvard. “And a cheap fix would be flee, tick, and worm medicine. It’ll save them money in the long run, but most importantly, it will keep your pet healthy and comfortable.”

The bill would amend federal misconduct statutes to make it easier for courts to find officers personally liable for the violation of civil rights. The move could have major consequences for officers who would think twice before abusing their power, but it could also make it more difficult to recruit police nationwide. It could also potentially lead to officers being held financially liable, too. Cities often bear the brunt of misconduct claims. In a 10-year period in New York, for example, the city paid out nearly $1 billion to settle claims made against police.

Fewer than two months until the presidential election, with mortgage giants Fannie May and Freddie Mac taken over by the government, with a war in Iraq that may be turning a corner, with an economy that if it is not in free fall, appears to be tumbling toward recession, and with, well, lots of issues that could benefit from thoughtful TV treatment, ABC has scheduled an hour and a half Primetime news magazine special for Tuesday, Sept. 16.
 Thank goodness. It must be a crucial issue to consume more time on that Tuesday night than was given to theTuesday night coverage of either the Democratic or Republican conventions on ABC or any other broadcast network other than PBS.
 So, is it a more in-depth look at the election issues that got short shrift in convention coverage, according to a study by the Project for Excellence in Journalism? Maybe it’s a town hall meeting about mortgages and how the loan crisis could trickle down further into every noook and cranny of the economy. Nope. It is UFO’s" Seeing is Believing."
 That’s right an hour and a half on UFOs. "For decades, millions of people around the world have been seeing UFOs hovering in their skies. It is a mystery that only science can solve, and yet the phenomenon remains largely unexamined."
 What? What? To quote John McEnroe berrating a judge over a close line call: "You can’t be serious!"
 UFO’s "largely unexamined?" The subject has been overcovered within an inch of its bug-eyed, extraterrestrial life. A subject that can be found at almost any moment of the day on some basic cable channel. perhaps ABC has discovered that Big Foot actually made all those crop circles.
 The show is billed as "building on the original Peter Jennings report," shamelessly borrowing from the journalistic bank account of the late anchor, who admittedly did do a report on UFO’s. The show apparently will combine UFO’s with the search for life on Mars by NASA scientists. That’s like combining Carl Sagan’s _Cosmos_ with an episode of the Jetsons.
 Back in February 2005, Jennings attempted to take a serious look at the subject, but essentially married new graphics with familiar stories and sitings. Perhaps ABC has uncovered footage that will establish the existence of visits by extraterrestrials to Earth. If so, I will stand corrected.

Tom Bloom, lead pastor of Community Vineyard Church, thought three weeks ago about the joyous moment when he could see his congregation instead of broadcasting into their homes.
   
 But to the 85 people who filed into the Cuyahoga Falls chapel on Sunday, there would be no joyful preaching.
   
 "I just thought it wouldn't feel right if we did a lot of celebrating when our nation is on fire," he said. "Our cities are burning with the protests of the wrongful killing of George Floyd -- in such a horrible manner in which white police officers took the life of this unarmed black person.
   
 "I share the anger and the outrage that's being displayed around the world," he began in a sermon of reckoning and reconciliation.
   
 With racial wounds reopening in America, Bloom sought a more authentic perspective than he could offer as a white man. But in the Falls, he said, there are no majority black churches.
   
 So he saved the second half of his sermon for Marv Hodges, senior pastor at Bridging the Gap Ministries, which is 2½ miles down the road in Akron's North Hill neighborhood.
   
 For his part, Bloom defined racism's origin and definition then explored solutions, mainly faith in God. He used a PowerPoint presentation with biblical footnotes to steer the audience, which was about half its normal size due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.
   
 Encouraged by his wife to speak the truth to what would be a mostly white crowd, Hodges took his half of the sermon to address the Holy Spirit in the Christian heart. For he who accepts Jesus Christ, Hodges said, is commanded by God to join "the ministry of reconciliation."
   
 "Now, if you haven't figured it out," Hodges told the casually dressed Sunday crowd, "I'm here today to provoke you."
   
 "My heart breaks for the madness that's going on," he said. "But my spirit is excited for the opportunity to be change agents."
   
 The pastors shared personal stories as youth struggling with racism. Chapter and verse after chapter and verse, they explained how man was made in God's image, and therefore all men (and women) are equal.
   
 Bloom said it must have been the Bible that inspired America's founding documents or Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address. "And yet," he said, "America, like all other nations on Earth, has a racist past, a racist history. And we have not lived up to our ideals."
   
 It is Satan -- the great deceiver cast down from the heavens -- who imbues unbelievers with the pride of thinking themselves better than others or the arrogance of thinking others less than them. Bloom said this is the origin of racism, man's original sin.
   
 Christ's death disarmed the devil by washing clean that sin. But Bloom and Hodges argue that while earthly education and surrounding oneself in diverse crowds may help, only the Holy Spirit can provide a truth great enough to overcome racism.
   
 No one is born racist, they said. It's handed down generation by generation.
   
 Bloom learned it from his father and his father's father in the hills of Pennsylvania. Though his family knew virtually no black people, Bloom's grandfather said terrible things about them, "because that's how he was raised. And he believed lies, and he taught them to me."
   
 Hodges' personal anecdote took the audience back to 1967. As a member of the Young Men's Christian Association in Akron (now known simply as the YMCA or Y), he had friends "with various levels of melanin" from diverse cultural and socioeconomic backgrounds.
   
 He attended South High School, which was derogatorily nicknamed "Congo Tech" at the time. He sat with his white Christian friends when their Firestone High School basketball team came to play South High.
   
 South won, big. Hodges' black classmates "jumped on" the Firestone cheerleaders and fans, he recalled. He grabbed his white friends by the hand and led them out of the melee. That night, he convinced his parents for a school transfer.
   
 "That's the first time I realized that something culturally was wrong," he said.
   
 As a pastor, Hodges has spent decades preaching on the 400 years of oppression "that brought us" time and time again to this moment of racial unrest.
   
 "It is time to make a change," he said, demanding that believers become active listeners and not skirt their God-given duty, bought with the blood of his only son, to be "ministers of reconciliation."
   
 Up the church aisles in the old Loews State Theatre, Hodge pointed to parishioners in their teens and 20s. Spinning himself in circles, he exclaimed how they would be the ones to vanquish racism, "to put their knee on Satan's neck," he said, referencing the nearly nine minutes a white Minneapolis police office knelt on Floyd's neck before he died.
   
 "I know that from here on out, until Jesus cracks the sky or takes me home, this is the battle," the black pastor said.

From an Irish perspective, one of the big differences between the Covid-19 crisis and the 2008 financial crisis is the state of the public finances. Back then, we were a financial basket case. Not only had we tied our day-to-day spending into property-related taxes, we had also guaranteed the banks, which had tied their finances to property. When the property genie disappeared, so did the State’s financial standing. Ireland Inc was effectively booted out of the bond markets in late 2010 and forced into a bailout soon after.

A group of English-language stations along the border with Mexico said it doesn’t want the option of continuing to broadcast in analog for up to five years after the Feb. 17, 2009, switch to digital. That stand exposed a rift between Spanish-language and English-language stations on the border.
 "We're stating our opposition to any legislation to continue analog transitions beyond February of next year," Kevin Lovell, general manager of KVIA-TV El Paso, Texas, told _B &C_ late Tuesday.
 The DTV Border Fix Act, which was co-sponsored by Sens. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-Texas) and Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), would allow qualified TV stations within 50 miles of the border to broadcast in analog until 2014.
 In a letter to the leadership of the House Energy & Commerce Committee and its Telecommunications & Internet Subcommittee, GMs (including Lovell) and executives from almost one-dozen stations said allowing certain broadcasters to delay the transition for up to five years -- as would the DTV Border Fix Act, which passed by voice vote in the Senate and is awaiting House action -- "threatens to put viewers along the border in a state of limbo."
 "Spanish-language broadcast interests have really pushed this because they want to continue transmissions to Mexico under the guise of emergency messages," Lovell said.
 Now, English-language broadcasters are pushing back. "This letter represents the majority of English-language broadcasters on the border," he added.
 "We have spent literally millions of dollars to be digital-ready on 2/17/09," the GMs wrote in a letter being faxed to congressional offices late Tuesday. "Many of us have multiple channels including local weather channels and targeted entertainment formats to better serve our markets and fulfill the promise of enhanced digital technologies. In the difficult financial environment today, should Congress now add the significant financial burden to border broadcasters of continuing analog-broadcasting operations for an additional five years?"
 The bill would make the continued analog broadcasting optional, and it has numerous caveats, including that the stations could not interfere with digital-TV stations, could not interfere with public-safety communications and could not prevent the auction of public spectrum.
 But Lovell said the reality is that if some stations continue in analog, the rest will be under competitive pressures to do so, as well, which would result in a confusing transition and additional expense by the stations that have to continue to simulcast.
 Hutchison has emphasized that the bill will ensure that Spanish-speakers along the border, many of whom are analog-only TV viewers, will continue to be able to get emergency information.
 Lovell conceded that there are high concentrations of analog-only viewers along the border, adding, "In El Paso, I believe it is still 34%. One out of three viewers is over-the-air, and I have to concur that the great majority of those are Spanish-dominant. So it is a little harder for them to get the message about the DTV converter boxes" and to receive emergency messages.
 But Lovell and company countered that a mix of analog and digital broadcasts along the border will be a big mess and actually make it "harder to get messages out." Then, he added, whenever the border has to make the transition, "we won't have this united, universal push."
 But he also suggested that the motive of the Spanish-language stations was not purely a case of relaying emergency information, saying that some have sales offices in Mexico and significant sales in Mexico.
 "I'm all for broadcasters making money," he said, "and it is optional, but if any station continues to broadcast in analog, even if it is in Spanish -- we still have viewers who are Spanish-dominant watching sports and other programming on our station -- we believe competitive pressures will require all of us to continue analog plus digital. Five years down the road, it will be a nightmare trying to convert us to a platform that has already been established across the country."
 Lovell said the timing of the letter was because Congress returned from its Labor Day recess Monday, and because the GMs believe there are "a number of lawmakers who don't know there is genuine and real opposition to analog extension."
 Among the station owners represented on the letter were Tribune, Pappas Telecasting, Cox Television, McGraw-Hill, Sunbelt Communications and News Press & Gazette.
 The letter was addressed to Committee chairman John Dingell (D-Mich.) and Telecommunications Subcommittee chairman Ed Markey (D-Mass.), as well as the ranking members of the committee and subcommittee.

Cable news channels and broadcast networks jumped on the House's failure Monday to pass a $700 million financial-bailout bill.
 Breaking-news graphics blanketed the cable airwaves, while NBC broke into regular programming for a special report on the bill.
 CBS also broke into regular programming for several minutes. Randall Pinkston anchored (Katie Couric is on the campaign trail), and business correspondent Anthony Mason reported.
 ABC broke in for several minutes, as well. Charles Gibson anchored, with Jake Tapper on the Hill and Betsy Stark on the set with Gibson in New York "only moments after the bill was gaveled dead," an ABC spokesman said.
 Former House Speaker and conservative Republican Newt Gingrich earlier in the day sent out an e-mail advising his colleagues to bite the bullet and vote for the bill, although he had many problems with it.
 The Dow Jones Industrial Average had plunged 777.68 points, or about 5%, at press time, and Republican and Democrats were said to be huddling to decide their next move.
 But it wasn't sounding too promising at press time. "I don't know that we know the path forward at this point," House Minority Leader John Boehner (R-Ohio) said at a press conference Monday afternoon. Republicans accused House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) of "poisoning" the bill.         Pelosi said in a press conference Monday that "where we go from here" is that "the lines of communications remain open....We delivered on our side of the bargain," she said, blaming the Republicans for the bill's failure.
 CNN was reporting that there were no plans for a revote Monday in the House. Many expected the bill to pass narrowly in the House Monday, with the Senate taking it up by midweek.         The vote was 228 to 205 against, with about 40% of Democrats voting against it and two thirds of Republicans voting against. Both sides accused the other of blowing up what looked to be a deal.         That could mean no progress until Wednesday given the Rosh Hashanah holiday on Tuesday. Rep. Barney Frank, chair of the financial services committee, told the press Monday that he would not be available Tuesday.
 There were reports that some of Republicans who were planning to vote for the bill and ultimately voted against it were turned by a floor speech by Pelosi, what Rep. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) called a "blame speech," that they felt was too critical of the administration. Frank said that he was "appalled" if that were the case, and that if he could have those 12 people's names, he would go speak "uncharacteristically nicely" to those Republicans.so they would not put "feeling over country."         Frank salso aid he thought that the Republicans were simply providing themselves cover for the fact that they didn't really have the votes. "You are watching a food fight in Congress," said Fox's Shepard Smith.         Rep. Tim Walberg (R-MI), who voted against the bill, told Fox News Channel that he was not miffed at Pelosi, but at a bill that did not have a sufficiently free market approach. He also said he didn't think there had ever been enough Republican votes to pass it and was surprised Pelosi had called the vote.         Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), who also voted no, said that the media's focus had been on Wall Street, but that hers had been on main street. She said her no vote was becuase the taxpayer would be "the lender of first resort," which she said was a position "I could not support."         Rep. Roy Blunt (R-MO), the minority whip, put some of the blame on the media, saying Monday in a press conference that every time he turned on the TV he heard press reports saying Republicans were being "unpatriotic."

“He has done a lot of stuff beyond what has been required as his job occupation as an assistant,” added former Tivy center Mason Roberts, who currently plays at Trinity University. “He goes the extra mile in everything he does. You know you are going to get 110% out of him.”
 Davis said he is going to invest his heart and soul into Antler basketball.
 “We are going to continue to love kids … and we are going to demand that they work hard,” Davis said.
 Those two principles have guided Davis during his coaching career. Throughout his Tivy tenure, he and fellow assistant coach Ray Fierro arrived at the High School every morning before dawn to watch film, trying to identify ways to help his players improve. He and Fierro spent their traveling across Texas to scout opponents.
 But despite his busy schedule, Davis still found the time to cultivate relationships with his players. Roberts credits Davis for helping him reach his potential at Tivy. The former didn’t receive much playing time during his sophomore season, but Davis continually pushed him to work hard that following offseason. More importantly, he convinced Roberts that he could excel on the court. Roberts earned second-team, all-district honors his junior season and was the District 26-5A Offensive MVP his senior year.
 Davis continued to remain in contact with Roberts after the latter graduated, checking to see how he was doing at Trinity.
 “Before I ever had self-confidence in myself, he was there for me the whole way,” Roberts said. “He just motivates people to do better and gets the best out of them. He’s really good at pushing you to limits that you couldn’t fathom that you had within yourself.”
 Davis is trying to do the same for Tivy’s current group of players. After Monday’s workout had finished, he told his players they had the chance to be special; they just had to keep working hard every day.
 “He’s a great coach, but a better man,” Johnston said. “The future is definitely in good hands with coach Davis at the reins.”

The Wisconsin Broadcasters Association said the marketwide "soft" analog cutoff test in Milwaukee Sept. 15 drew 3,000 viewer calls in less than three hours.
 Four stations in the market pulled the plug on their analog signal for one minute at 5:10 p.m., while others ran crawls or graphics at the same time with digital-TV-education information and a referral to a live, three-hour phone bank that was set up to answer viewer questions.
 WBA president Michelle Vetterkind said the eight stations that did not pull the plug had "certain technical issues" that prevented them from doing so at this time. She did not elaborate, but she said this was the first of several tests and she expected that all would ultimately test pulling the plug, as well.
 She added that viewers "truly appreciated" the phone bank and had "all types of questions," including about coupons, converter boxes and antennas.
 According to Vetterkind, 23% of Milwaukee's viewership is analog-only.

The Federal Communications Commission upheld a $25,000 fine against KUSI-TV San Diego for failing to provide adequate visual warnings to hearing-impaired viewers during its coverage of California wildfires.
 It was running up against a five-year statute of limitations since the incident occurred in October 2003.
 In response to a complaint and subsequent investigation, the FCC initially proposed the fines in 2005, but the station challenged it.
 "I think the FCC has gone crazy with fines thinking this is their sole purpose in life," station owner Michael McKinnon told _B &C_ at the time, arguing that the station had been understaffed as it was, with one-half of the employees at home trying to save their property, including the general manager, who was on his roof with a hose. "This was a disaster, not an inconvenience.”
 "People with hearing disabilities have a right to the same timely emergency information as stations provide to their hearing audiences," then-FCC chairman Michael Powell said at the time. "The commission remains committed to strong enforcement in this critical area.” The Kevin Martin commission agreed.
 In releasing the final order for the fine Thursday, the FCC said it was not persuaded by various arguments, including that the station was exercising editorial judgment about what of the emergency information was sufficiently crucial and credible to make visually available given that visuals had more impact and authority than words.
 The fine could have been much more. The FCC pointed out that it found 22 separate violations, each potentially warranting an $8,000 base fine, which would have added up to $176,000.
 "We determined, however, that a strict application of $8,000 for each of the 22 apparent violations would result in a total proposed forfeiture that is excessive in light of the circumstances presented," the commission's Enforcement Bureau said in the order. "Furthermore, in determining the total number of apparent violations, we took into consideration the circumstances facing KUSI in providing emergency coverage during the wildfires."

The voices shouting for goal-line technology may be getting louder, but Pele is calling for extra time on introducing it to the beautiful game
 We're nearing the end of 2012's European Championships, and we're still left with so many questions. What happened to the Dutch? Why was there a naked man behind the England goal during the penalty shoot-out against Italy? What are all these extra officials actually supposed to do?
 Unfortunately, as we all could have predicted, the question of goal-line technology continues to rear it's ugly head as hosts Ukraine found themselves on the wrong end of another bad decision (if you an offside call, also not given, in the build up).
 The idea of football embracing technology continues to divide those in and outside of the game with FIFA set to make a decision on its introduction in July this year. There is one man who is still not convinced on using tech to banish the 'ghost' goal. Scorer of over 1,000 goals, World Cup-winning legend Pele sat down with T3 to tell us what he thinks about the great tech in football debate. Here's what he had to say.
 It is a simple fact that the more quickly the game of football moves, the better it is. This is a world away from sports like tennis, Formula 1 or American football, and this point shouldn't be forgotten in the renewed rush to bring in goal-line technology.
 As coverage of the game increases, so does the technology used to cover it and, after Euro 2012 this year, the 2014 World Cup in Brazil is set to be the most analysed football event yet. While you can argue this is good for the game, it's undoubtedly bad for referees. Very bad.
 You can say, "Oh the referee made a mistake," but referees have to decide on the spot whether it is a foul or not, while players sometimes play dirty - that is football. Of course, you can use a camera to help decisions, but at what expense to the game?
 I understand the calls for decisions to be correct in this economic age of sponsors and sky-high salaries. I am not even against changing the game, if it's necessary. You look at the boots that players use now - the different materials, how light they are, the style statements they make - and they're fantastic. I scored 1,281 goals in my career, but if I had been lucky enough to have played with boots like these I'd have scored double.
 I even wrote in my autobiography a few years ago that I wanted to have free- kicks without walls, but to me it's all about fairness. When I used to play I would go past one, two, three players then the last one would make a foul outside the area, always from behind and right on the line, but it was no penalty. All the players would then go back on the line against me. It should be just the last player who made the foul in the wall, not all the others. You've already gone past the whole midfield, you shouldn't have to face them again. You see, walls are fundamentally not fair.
 But there's a difference between fairness and eliminating errors. Mistakes are always going to happen. Football is a very quick game and you have to make decisions in the blink of an eye. The thinking behind goal-line technology is if the referee believes the ball may have crossed the line, he'll stop play and ask someone in a TV studio and they will say "yes" or "no". But what happens if the other team mounts a quick counter-attack? How do you know you're not preventing them from scoring? Sure, if it's a goal, everything's okay, but if the fourth official agrees it didn't cross the line, you've proved a point but you've stopped the fl ow of the game and potentially prevented a goal, which again isn't fair.
 In sports where you stop regularly, this is fine, you have the time to check calls, but with football you always keep on running, it's just too complicated. Geoff Hurst's goal for England in the 1966 World Cup Final against Germany was so quick, would it have stood under examination? I'd much prefer extra referees behind each goal to help judge whether the ball has crossed the line and if a penalty should be given.
 In fact, goal-line technology has already proved problematic. In Dubai they've carried out experiments with a chip in the ball, but when the goalkeeper covered the chip, it didn't work. If you use tech and still don't get it right every time, it doesn't increase fairness, so why implement it at all? Let's not rush into goal-line tech, but take time to consider it.

Before the virus hit, the agency was planning to borrow €10-€14 billion this year; now the requirement is €20-€24 billion. The Government is expected to run a €30 billion-plus deficit this year – due to a combination of more health and welfare spending and less tax revenue – and part of it will be funded via NTMA borrowing. Normally the agency wouldn’t have as many big syndicated transactions in such a short space of time but it wants to bank the money while demand is there. A wise option, no doubt. As countries across the globe borrow to fund their pandemic bills, the level of indebtedness is set to balloon. Will that in turn change the current market atmosphere? Time will tell.

FSN is considering significantly scaling back national programming across its army of profitable regional sports networks as soon as early next year, according to multiple sources with knowledge of the situation.
 Fox Sports executives declined to comment, but sources said that with the success of the RSNs coming on the back of local programming, the company will scale back and could eventually eliminate the expensive production of national original programs that run across the network of regionals. That would mean the end of national shows fed across the RSNs such as FSN's veteran talk show _Best Damn Sports Show Period_ , which sources said may be the first to go.
 While sources said the move is completely unrelated, that show is losing its executive producer, John Entz, who is leaving to join Major League Baseball's new network as senior vice president of production. He will be in charge of all in-studio and game coverage, reporting directly to network chief and former CBS Sports executive producer Tony Petitti. An announcement of that move is expected this week.
 Since Fox formally launched FSN in 1996, it has often tried to bolster its national programming presence. One method was the introduction of an array of studio shows. But more recently, it increasingly ceded that territory to ESPN and instead successfully found a groove by concentrating on local coverage, which is built around a dominant aggregation of local professional- and college-sports-rights deals. That lineup has led FSN to be a major profit center for the company.
 Even if FSN completely jettisoned original productions such as _Best Damn Sports Show Period_ , as well as _Sport Science_ , _Amazing Sports Stories_ and _Baseball's Golden Age_ , it would continue to provide national coverage of sporting events it has under contract to all of its RSNs. By contract, FSN regional networks need to have national programming in the case of local blackouts and other situations where a national feed is needed.
 The talk of cutting back national original programming at FSN comes as the prominence of the RSNs within the News Corp. structure was demonstrated by a recent restructuring at Fox National Cable Networks. The organization last week named Fox alum and former Gemstar-TV Guide International chief Rich Battista as president. While execs such as Big Ten Network president Mark Silverman and Fox Soccer Channel chief David Sternberg will now report to Battista, FSN boss Randy Freer will continue to report directly to chairman and CEO Tony Vinciquerra, to whom Battista will also report.
 Vinciquerra himself was recently (and quietly) promoted to the role of chairman and CEO from his previous role as president and CEO.
 In another move, FSN president Bob Thompson will transition into a consultancy role next summer, a move that has been in the works for some time. Thompson has been an integral part of building FSN into a prominent asset for the company.

BEIJING (AP) — As the coronavirus spread, the world’s richest communist dug into his deep pockets. Jack Ma, founder of e-commerce giant Alibaba Group and a member of the ruling Communist Party, helped to pay for 1,000 ventilators delivered to New York in April. Ma's foundation also is giving ventilators, masks and other supplies in Africa, Latin America and Asia. The pandemic marks the debut of China's business elite as global humanitarian donors alongside their American, European and Japanese counterparts. Ma, Alibaba and other Chinese companies and tycoons are donating hundreds of millions of dollars of medical supplies, food and cash in dozens of countries. Video service TikTok has promised $250 million to pay health workers and help others hurt by the outbreak. Tencent, operator of the popular WeChat messaging service, pledged $100 million and says it has sent masks and protective gear to 15 countries including the United States. Other companies including computer maker Lenovo and electric automaker BYD Auto have given masks and other supplies. Haier Smart Home, a global appliance maker, says its factory in Pakistan is distributing food to neighbors. That gives donors a chance to repair China’s image and gain credit with President Xi Jinping's government, which faces criticism its secrecy and delay in responding to the virus that emerged in central China in December made the outbreak worse. “No single country can handle this crisis independently,” Ma said during an online seminar organized by his foundation for African doctors to speak with Chinese experts who fought the outbreak. This wave of Chinese donations is notable for “giving internationally, which is usually quite limited in scope,” said Edward Cunningham, who researches Chinese...
