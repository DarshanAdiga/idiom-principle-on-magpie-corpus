Joe is smart and ambitious but has little experience with large projects yet. He knows there’s an open-source culture out there, but isn’t part of it – he’s thought about running Linux at home because the more senior geeks around him all seem to do that, but hasn’t found a good specific reason to jump yet. In truth most of what he does with his home machine is play games. He likes “Elite: Dangerous” and the Bioshock series.

If this history teaches us anything, it is that borders are derived realities and not autonomous facts. Manmohan Singh's fond hope of avoiding conflict over territory by "making borders irrelevant" is increasingly difficult to realise in a world where institutional restraints on aggression are weakening and the new game in town is unalloyed power-play. But, come to think of it, when was it really different?",

Robbie Williams has insisted Take That "will ride again", after teaming up with former bandmate Gary Barlow for several songwriting sessions in the past few weeks.
 The 46-year-old singer delighted fans by joining Gary, Mark Owen and Howard Donald for a live-streamed virtual fundraiser last month (May20) - the first time he had performed with the band since 2018.
 But it hopefully won't be the last time, as Robbie hinted about potentially working with Take That again during an interview on Mark Wright's Heart Evening Show on Thursday night (25Jun20).
 "I’ve been writing some songs with Gary Barlow in the last few weeks too," Robbie said when interviewer Mark asked him if there were any more Take That plans in the pipeline.
 However, Robbie remained resolutely tight-lipped as to when a potential reunion could take place.
 "Yeah, so, you know, we will ride again, me and my brothers," he said. "I don’t know when that’s going to be but we will ride again."
 Although Robbie, Gary, Mark and Howard all reunited virtually for the concert last month, former bandmate Jason Orange was missing from the line-up. He has chosen to remain out of the spotlight since leaving the band in 2014 after deciding he didn't want to make music anymore.

Big Hit was an outlier. While K-pop fans have received media attention for their support in the Black Lives Matter movement, the industry has largely remained quiet about what has become a global flashpoint. The silence from most of the K-pop industry stands out even more against the unprecedented number of businesses standing with the anti-racism movement as a corporate strategy.

As an expert in the subject, Lizundia has reviewed together with another three researchers from Italy and Canada the main developments and advances that have emerged recently in the area of cellulose nanocrystals. "There is a huge number of research papers explaining the synthesis of materials of this type and which are geared towards what is known as proof of concept, in other words, to show that they can be used for a specific application. Cellulose nanocrystals have been widely used to mechanically strengthen polymers. Yet there are hardly any pieces of work that catalogue and explain the applications of hybrid materials produced using cellulose nanocrystals. This is what we have contributed: we have described the state of the art in this area of knowledge by conducting an in-depth review of the papers published in this respect," explained the researcher.

Most of these fossil eggs belong to a new egg genus and species, called Himeoolithus murakamii, and are exceptionally small, with an estimated mass of 9.9 grams--about the size of a modern quail egg. However, biological classification analysis implies that the eggs belonged not to early birds, but to their cousins, the non-avian theropod dinosaurs (the group that includes well-known carnivores like Tyrannosaurus and Velociraptor). That puts Himeoolithus murakamii among the smallest non-avian theropod eggs reported to date. These tiny eggs were notably elongated in shape--unusual for similarly small eggs among Cretaceous birds, but typical among larger non-avian theropod eggs.

(The Conversation is an independent and nonprofit source of news, analysis and commentary from academic experts.) Ann M. Cheney, University of California, Riverside (THE CONVERSATION) The Conversation is running a series of dispatches from clinicians and researchers operating on the front lines of the coronavirus pandemic. You can find all of the stories here. “Doctora,” a community health worker yelled from across the room. “People are lined up along the fence. Under the sun. Do we have water for them?” I was standing in the middle of an air-conditioned room in April at a COVID-19 testing site for Latino farmworkers and their families in the eastern part of Southern California’s Coachella Valley. Outside was an ever-increasing line of symptomatic patients, individuals who either reported having a cough, fever or difficulty breathing, or who had been in contact with someone with the virus in the past two weeks. They were all waiting to get tested. In the days before, a team of promotoras – trusted community leaders with expertise in community organizing who act as connectors to the community – had fielded call after call from concerned community members. The community members were calling about their eligibility to get tested and whether Social Security numbers and health care insurance coverage would be required. Some farmworkers shared that they couldn’t return to work without getting the test and producing evidence that they were COVID-free to their farm managers. Often ineligible for employment benefits, loss of employment can comprise their ability to survive. As an anthropologist at the University of California, Riverside, I have a doctorate of anthropology not medicine.
