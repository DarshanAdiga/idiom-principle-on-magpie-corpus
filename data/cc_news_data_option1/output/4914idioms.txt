The Commission flagged that the deal could further entrench Google’s dominance by increasing the vast amount of data it already uses to serve targeted ads. The Commission’s probe will also look into the effect of combining the companies’ databases and abilities in digital healthcare and whether Google should be able to “degrade the interoperability of rivals' wearables with Google's Android operating system for smartphones once it owns Fitbit”. The probe, being carried out with the cooperation of the European Data Protection Board and other competition authorities, is due to close on December 9.

Brennan said, "I don't know who was responsible for this assassination. But again, I do believe that this is something that Western Democracies, as well as countries around the globe, should not engage in an assassination. So, whether or not the Trump administration was aware of it in advance or provided some type of support, I am not aware. But this is something that should be condemned by the international community. If the Iranians carried out an attack like this against an Israeli scientist inside of Israel, there would be condemnation. So I think this goes way beyond what can be and should be expected of countries in this day and age."

My favorite supposed tactic...  In WW2, Finnish soldiers, all in white, would burrow through the snow for hundreds of feet, come up behind Russian sentries, and slice their throats.  They would then carve out the sentry's LIVER, and vanish back under the snow.  This terror tactic left Russians standing around asking, "The Finns aren't really EATING those livers, are they?"  And then some sergeant would say, "Ivan, you're on sentry duty tonight."  Russians didn't get much sleep on the Finnish front.
