New Delhi, May 1 (PTI) The Delhi Disaster Management Authority on Friday said that from now on, coronavirus sampling and testing data will be collected at the level of chief district medical officer under the supervision of the concerned district magistrate.
 The move is aimed at reducing "difficulty in reconciling the data of samples collected, number of tests carried out and the pendency in various labs and institutions, which is hampering effective management of the pandemic," Delhi Chief Secretary Vijay Dev, who is also the DDMA chairman, said in an order.
 He said heads of the concerned hospitals, testing facilities and labs will be responsible for furnishing the requisite information to the respective district magistrates through the chief district medical officer (CDMO).
 The CDMO will be responsible for submitting reports to the health department on a daily basis and the district magistrates should ensure that correct and authentic reports are submitted and updated every day without fail, the order said.

Olowu of Kuta, HRH Oba Adekunle Oyelude Makama, Tegbosun III, said that the "gestures is our little way of giving back to the society as a royal father and to support our governor, Alhaji Gboyega Oyetola who is doing a good job towards improving the wellbeing of our people."
 Oba Makama lauded President Muhammadu Buhari and the Presidential Task Force on Covid 19 for being pro-active to curtail the spread of the dreaded Coronavirus.
 According to the monarch, the efforts of the Federal Government has paid off as the lockdown has really worked, and now that it's being eased. He urge caution and critical appraisal of situation before total resumption of activities.
 He noted that human life is an invaluable asset and its preservation should be considered an utmost priority above any economic consideration or social activity that has being in limbo in the last 40 days.
 While thanking the Federal Government for the 1,800 bags of rice sent to Osun, the revered monarch however urged the Presidential Task Force on COVID 19 to do more in term of financial assistance such as was rendered to Lagos, Ogun and the FCT in the wake of the deadly pandemic.
 Olowu, who had earlier sought the assistance of the Federal Government immediately after the index case and the Ejigbo returnees from Abidjan increased the phenomenal number of people with Coronavirus in the State, said such gesture is predicated on the fact that Osun was not financially buoyant before the COVID-19 which has further put more pressure on the lean resources of the State.
 "I think the Federal Government has done so well in curtailing the COVID-19 and we must commend them. Even those who had predicted doom for Africa based on the way the rampaging COVID-19 humbled some of the developed nations that boast of best healthcare infrastructure cannot but commend the Buhari led government for its comportment, proper planning and networking which has led to the reduction in fatality recorded since February 27 when the index case was detected".
 Furthermore, he said "A State like Osun deserves financial assistance to augment its lean financial resources in order for the its government not to grind to a halt. Federal Government can also grant debt relief or moratorium for Osun State so as to be on sound footing in the post COVID-19."
 He, however, commiserated with President Buhari over the death of his distinguished Chief of Staff, Malam Abba Kyari and other Nigerians within our country and in the diaspora, who have lost loved ones to the COVID-19 pandemic.

"I think I write the way I do because of a vitamin deficiency. I don't eat any vegetables. I just eat meat and potatoes. I think I'm trying to make up in my songwriting what I lack in vitamins." - John Prine      If he didn't already know what a spring tonic is, John Prine was the kind of person who would have been disappointed to learn it isn't an alcoholic drink. But I bet he knew. With roots in western Kentucky, he was country to the bone.      A spring tonic is a mix of wild plant parts traditionally gathered at the end of winter in many rural parts of America. Back in the day, folk survived winter on a Prine-style diet of rations that had dwindled to the likes of flour, bacon, potatoes and sugar. After months indoors on a white, greasy diet, the first hunt of the year for green, vitamin-rich plants was an awakening for the mind, body and belly.      I don't know that Prine went foraging for wild plants in his spare time, but even if he didn't long for chlorophyll, he acknowledged vegetables as a path to salvation. His advice to "plant a little garden, eat a lot of peaches, and try to find Jesus on your own" remains a three-line anthem to generations of back-to-the-landers.      Here in our first post-Prine spring we are largely stuck at home, or close to it, and there may not be a better time to forage the neighborhood for your own local spring tonic. I'm going to tell you how to serve it in the form of a gathered plant pesto. If you told him it was Weed Pesto, as I call it, the man with the twinkle in his songs might have used it.      Wild & edible   Every region will have its own list of edible, nutritious, ideally palatable spring greens. And there are some plants that are available nearly everywhere, like dandelion, lambsquarters, chickweed, purslane, dock, sorrel, cattails, nettles, watercress, asparagus and fiddlehead ferns. Even Johnny jump ups, also called violas, are edible, with a fresh, minty taste.      Each of these plants will have its own specifics for harvesting and cooking. Nettles, which have a fragrant, almost fishy taste, require scissors and a bag, and perhaps gloves, and should always be eaten cooked or blended unless you have the tongue of a bear. Dandelions, which are bitter as a good IPA beer, can be eaten raw or cooked; every single inch, from root to flower. Ditto for chickweed, which tastes a bit like parsley and licorice.      Many of the same principles for collecting wild plants also apply in your backyard. Every would-be forager must assess the grounds at their disposal and strategize accordingly.      The mentality involved in foraging is one to which any food shopper can relate. We go to the supermarket in search of one grocery item, but it's sold out and we have to improvise, and come home with another.      But the wild food we gather has not been vetted for edibility like grocery store food. Before you put anything in your mouth, find a trusted reference on the edible plants of your area. Search any piece of land that is legally available and clean of pesticides and other chemical and yellow animal fluids. Always do your harvesting away from any trail, and don't ever wipe out a location, so the patch can recover. And if you are lucky enough to have a backyard, explore every square inch.      How to enjoy   The easiest way to enjoy these plants might be in a saute pan, a handful of spring greens at a time, with salt, onions and olive oil. If you have a decent blender, this pesto recipe is thick with flavor, fat and chlorophyll. Toss it onto hot noodles. Scramble it into eggs or migas. Or just eat it off the spoon.      Pesto is one of the tastier ways to consume any green plant, especially those with strong flavors. It can incorporate essentially anything green, though some leaves, and combinations of leaves, will taste better than others. If not good enough, add more nuts, garlic, oil and cheese.      Our pesto will have a base of dandelion, since they are literally everywhere. In today's version I add nettles, as they are prolific right now where I live, and make a thick, aromatic pesto. But you could substitute any number of wild greens or weeds, like lambsquarter, watercress or chickweed, or a mixture of whatever you think will go well together. If these flavors are too strong, you could also substitute parsley or basil in place of some of the wild stuff.      Weed Pesto   8 servings   • 2 tablespoons chopped garlic   • 1 teaspoon salt   • 1 cup olive oil   • 1/2 cup almonds or pine nuts   • ½ cup grated parmesan or romano cheese   • Zest of a lemon, and 2 tablespoons of juice   • 4 cups chopped dandelion greens, loosely packed, spotlessly clean   • 5 three-inch nettle tips (or other greens)      Add the garlic, salt, oil, nuts, cheese, lemon juice and zest to the blender and turn them into a thin, homogenous solution. Carefully add the greens to the pesto, a few at a time, until they too are part of the smooth paste.   Serve tossed on piping hot noodles, which will cook the garlic just a tad. I like to stir in some sauteed greens, too.      Refrigerate the leftovers.

Roy D. da Roza, (Dan), passed away on April 28, 2020, at the age of 90, after a brief illness. He was the devoted husband of Mary Connick da Roza, for 67 years. He was the son of the late Ernest Daniel da Roza, and Addie Sills da Roza, and the brother of the late Jean Marie da Roza Rogers. He was the proud father of 5 children: Kathleen Bruce, Roy da Roza (Margie), Addie Scullin (Dan), Ann Avallone (Tony), and Mary Kay Sonnier (John), and the loving grandfather of twelve grandchildren, Jennifer Morrison, Jason Bruce, Stephanie Purvis, Paul da Roza, Lindsey Marion, Justin da Roza, Emily Scullin, Daniel Scullin, Stephen Avallone, Mary Avallone, Hayden Sonnier, and Nathan Sonnier, and 13 great grandchildren. Dan was born on December 29, 1929, in Miami, Florida, and moved to New Orleans in 1938, where he became a lifelong resident. He attended Warren Easton High School, graduating in 1946, and graduated from LSU in 1951 in Business Administration. Outside of his family, service to his country was his most prideful accomplishment. At the age of 22, he enlisted in the Army, completing basic training at Fort Chaffey, Arkansas, in the artillery. After basic training, he completed leadership school at Fort Chaffey, and then went on to Officer Candidate School in Fort Benning, Georgia. It was here that he attended jump school, and received his wings as a paratrooper. He was assigned to the 508th airborne regiment combat team, prior to being sent overseas to Korea. In Korea he was assigned to the 15th infantry regiment, third infantry division, as a First Lieutenant, where he earned a bronze star. Integrated into the 15th infantry was a battalion of Greek soldiers. He became such good friends with these soldiers, that he received a special citation, making him an honorary member of the Greek Army. He later received the Louisiana Veterans Honor Medal, awarded to him by Governor Bobby Jindal. After being honorably discharged he returned home, and worked for R.V. Whittaker, as an accountant. He eventually went on to open Tropical Rattan Furniture Store, where he worked until retirement. Dan was a family man and loved family vacations in Suches, Georgia with the Paul Connick, and the Wayne Rogers families. He loved Mardi Gras and attending parades at the invitation of his dear friend, Steve Enright, on Mardi Gras Day. He always looked forward to the spring, and the annual family crayfish boil, at the "Avallone Park". Dan also loved the game of bridge and poker, and cherished the many friendships made while sitting at a card table. He always enjoyed the years spent as part of a gourmet club, with a small group of very close friends, that always had a good time together. In retirement, he enjoyed traveling abroad with his wife, Mary. He also spent time volunteering at the World War 11 Museum; Meals on Wheels; and at the Jefferson Parish Library. Dan was the ultimate Saints fan, which lasted until the day before he died, as he asked through his oxygen mask, "Who did the Saints draft"? Dan was loved by many, and will be forever missed. Due to COVID, there will be a memorial celebration of his life, at a later date. The family invites you to share your thoughts, fond memories, and condolences online at www.lakelawnmetairie.com.

Jean was one-of-a-kind. We will miss her love, endless energy and dedication to her family and friends. Services are private. A celebration of both Jean and Dick's lives will be held at a later date.

What makes a film like _Back to the Future_ stand the test of time [travel]? Well, I can tell you it’s not the shaky science of gigawatts and flux capacitors. While those terms have become a beloved part of our pop culture lexicon, they’re not the reason why the 1985 classic has informed every single time travel comedy that’s come since.

Reigns has been one of the top Wish granters in WWE since John Cena has focused more on his Hollywood career. Cena continues to grant some Wishes, but Reigns seemed to be the new face of the WWE - Make-A-Wish partnership until recently. As seen above, Reigns appeared on WWE's The Bump back in February for a special visit with 12 year old Israel Rodriguez from Make-A-Wish.
 As noted last month, WWE officials issued an edict that said Reigns was not to be mentioned on WWE TV for the time being. Reigns has not been seen since before _WrestleMania_ 36\. He was set to capture the WWE Universal Title from WWE Hall of Famer Bill Goldberg, but backed out of the match as he was concerned with working during the coronavirus pandemic because he is immunocompromised due to his battles with leukemia. There is still no word on when Reigns might return to action, but it's been speculated that we won't see him for a while, depending on what happens with the COVID-19 outbreak.
