Great article thanks Subby.      I can't imagine that performance anxiety is solved by having to try to get it up in court but that might be some people's deal, I guess.      Reminds me of the joke which only works well in single payer healthcare environs:      A couple go to the doctor claiming they're having trouble in the bedroom, the doctor asks for details and they volunteer to show him, they go at it on the bed in his office, it's all great, they both love it, it ends with all the right climaxes. They come back two weeks later saying they're still having issues, before the doctor can say a word they're at it again on the bed in the doctor's surgery, it's fantastic for both of them.      They turn up two weeks later and before they can say a word the doctor intervenes and says "You clearly aren't having problems in bed, what's the real reason you're here". The man replies "Well we're married, but we're not married to each other, so we can't go to her place and we can't go to my place. A hotel room is $200 but here it's $80 and we get $60 back on Medicare!"

The Golden State Warriors have the No. 2 pick, a chance to add a top young player to a team that reached five straight NBA Finals before tumbling to the bottom of the league when Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson were injured. Charlotte picks third, followed by Chicago and Cleveland.
 The teams lacked some resources to evaluate players, without the normal draft combine in Chicago or the ability to invite players to their facilities for meetings and workouts. Perhaps that's partly the reason there is no consensus No. 1 pick this year like Zion Williamson in 2019.
 "I would say the analysis is fair. There is no guy that has separated themself from the pack, from public or external view," Timberwolves President Gersson Rosas said.
 Edwards believes the lack of an NCAA Tournament hurt the players. They couldn't make a final collegiate statement like Ja Morant did when he turned in a triple-double in an upset victory for Murray State in the first round of the 2019 NCAA Tournament. That helped secure him as the No. 2 pick behind Williamson and he was a runaway winner of the Rookie of the Year award after nearly leading Memphis to the playoffs.
 Wiseman wouldn't have had that chance anyway. He averaged 19.7 points and 10.7 rebounds in three games after arriving as the nation's No. 1 recruit, then was suspended by the NCAA for eligibility reasons and announced he was leaving the program to prepare for the draft.
 "Of course I wanted to win a national championship, of course I wanted to establish that situation with my teammates," he said. "I love my teammates, I actually text them every day. But you know how life happens. Like, stuff hits you out of nowhere, but I feel that me just being there gave me a lot of mental toughness, gave me a lot of maturity as a person."
 He worked out for only the Warriors and Hornets, suggesting the Wolves may be choosing between Edwards and Ball with 2015 No. 1 pick Karl-Anthony Towns entrenched as their man in the middle.
 If it's Ball, he ends a run a 10 straight one-and-dones to be the No. 1 pick. Blake Griffin in 2009 is the last non-college freshman to be the top selection.
 Ball didn't do college at all, playing professionally in Lithuania and Australia. It certainly wasn't the smoothest path to the NBA, which perhaps makes him the perfect player to handle a year when everything else about the draft process has been upended.
 "I feel like I'm just the right man for it," Ball said. "Like I said, I feel like I'm born for this whole thing going on."
