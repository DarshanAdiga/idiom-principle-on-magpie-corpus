Chirico: 'Scudetto a tavolino alla Juve? No grazie. Ma sarebbe un risarcimento per Calciopoli'


--DocBreak--
Derby are hoping for a swift conclusion to discussions after granting Chelsea permission to speak to their manager Frank Lampard.
 Lampard, the Blues’ record goalscorer following a glittering playing career with the Premier League giants, has been strongly linked with the vacant job at Stamford Bridge since Maurizio Sarri left his role as boss on June 16 to take over at Italian champions Juventus.
 Chelsea have been allowed to talk to the 41-year-old, who impressed during his first season in management at Derby by guiding the Rams to the brink of promotion and the Championship play-off final.
 A statement issued by Derby said: “Derby County Football Club can confirm that they have granted permission for Chelsea Football Club to speak to Frank Lampard about the vacant managerial position at Stamford Bridge.
 “With pre-season fast approaching for both clubs it is hoped this will allow Chelsea to swiftly conclude their discussions.
 “The club will make no further comment until it is appropriate to do so.”
 Lampard has been been in talks about a new contract at Derby since the play- off final defeat to Aston Villa at Wembley last month and Chelsea would have to pay compensation to get the former England international as he has two years remaining on the deal he signed last summer.
 The approach could add to what is already a summer of upheaval at Pride Park and uncertainty surrounding preparations for the 2019/20 campaign.
 Much of Derby’s success last season was down to Lampard’s shrewd use of the loan market and key players such as Harry Wilson (Liverpool), Mason Mount (Chelsea) and Fikayo Tomori (Chelsea) have since returned to their parent clubs.
 Meanwhile, a handful of other players, including Ashley Cole, are out of contract while Craig Bryson has already left to join Aberdeen.
 Should Lampard leave, Derby owner Mel Morris would need to act quickly to appoint a replacement with so much left up in the air as regards the playing squad.
 Former England midfielder Lampard made 648 appearances for Chelsea, scoring 211 goals and winning 11 major trophies.
 If he does take over at Stamford Bridge, he will inherit a transfer embargo after Chelsea were given a two-window ban by FIFA – a decision the club is appealing against at the Court of Arbitration for Sport.

 Not even the coronavirus can stop RnB artiste AliKiba from breaking the internet. It is business as usual for the ‘Aje’ hitmaker. This was evident earlier this week when the Bongo Flava heavyweight decided to bless his fans with a new joint titled ‘Dodo’.
 It was through his official Instagram account where he made the announcement to his half a million followers that he was about to reveal something ‘huge’. As the clock ticked and hours withered away everyone was in an expectant stance, wondering what the self-titled ‘King of Bongo Flava’ had up his sleeves.
 When the time was ripe, a surprise unlike any other was revealed. On any other normal day, this would’ve been a normal surprise, but considering the global situation at the moment the scale and weight associated with Kiba’s reveal was tenfold more profound.
 AliKiba premiered the audio and video of his new song ‘Dodo’. Dodo, a song which has come at just the right time as people are indoor looking for anything to excite their days is in-line with the same trend of great melody and soothing words to boot that have become Alikiba’s trademark. With a masterly of words that go in tandem with melodious beats, Dodo might yet become another Kiba smash-hit.
 That is not all that Alikiba had in his bag of presents. What most people didn’t expect, was to see former model turned musician Hamisa Mobetto appear as a vixen in the music video which took a leaf of inspiration from ancient Egyptian style. The theme, style and video execution was akin to the Egyptian Kings and Queens.
 The music video was shot in Zanzibar and Alikiba extended his appreciation to the Ministry of Information, Tourism and Heritage in Zanzibar, hotel Verde Zanzibar and the management of Mji Mkongwe Zanzibar.

Rather than ramping up a massive national testing regime, the federal government has been signaling to states that they’re soon going to be on their own. And as for contact tracing — like a cell-phone app, or an army of public- health officials, to track down every contact of a person who tests positive — well, there’s simply no sign whatsoever that either project is even in the works, let alone ready for an early May rollout. And if the government doesn’t have the capacity to quickly identify and isolate new cases, relaxing social distancing will simply lead to renewed outbreaks.

The other thing I do when I talk with reporters is to be straight. I try not to deceive them or to be defensive, because those are precisely the ways most people get themselves into trouble with the press. Instead, when a reporter asks me a tough question, I try to frame a positive answer, even if that means shifting the ground. For example, if someone asks me what negative effects the world’s tallest building might have on the West Side, I turn the tables and talk about how New Yorkers deserve the world’s tallest building, and what a boost it will give the city to have it again. When a reporter asks why I build only for the rich, I note that the rich aren’t the only ones who benefit from my buildings. I explain that I put thousands of people to work who might otherwise be collecting unemployment, and that I add to the city’s tax base every time I build a new project. I also point out that buildings like Trump Tower have helped spark New York’s renaissance.

After the cold and dreary months of winter, I am always eager for spring and to decorate for the Easter season. For me, celebrating Easter and the joys of spring go hand in hand.      Once you make the decision to set a formal or informal table, then the fun can begin. We've become a disposable society where paper plates, cups and napkins are the norm for family gatherings. Consider using the opportunity to take out the fine china, crystal and flatware. If you don't own fine china, but would like to start your own collection, visit estate sales or antique malls. While you're searching for these goodies, keep your eyes open for ceramic bunnies, chicks and lambs. Vintage tablecloths, napkins and candle holders are often found for great prices.      For a semi-formal place setting, I have often used wicker chargers. Dollar stores offer so many unique items to "fill in the gaps" on the table. Consider small vine bird's nests, tiny Easter eggs to fill small baskets at each place setting and holiday-themed salt and pepper shakers. Fresh flowers are always appropriate to herald the arrival of spring!      For fun and informal meals, vibrant Fiestaware plates always bring compliments from my guests. If you don't want to purchase an entire set of dishes, neighborhood yard sales and estate sales are your friends. The best part of using Fiestaware (besides its bright colors) is the ease of mixing and matching. I've used pink, purple, robin's egg blue, green, orange and yellow all together for an Easter egg color-themed table.      If room allows, have a separate "kids' table." Children love the bright colors and, again, the dollar stores are a treasure trove of goodies for setting the perfect table for your youngest guests. Vinyl tablecloths that can be easily cleaned are perfect for the inevitable spills and drips. Melamine plates are suitable for the kids, along with plastic cups or glasses. Consider filling a large basket with plastic Easter eggs as your centerpiece. If time allows before the meal, let the kids decorate their own boiled and dyed egg to use as their place setting marker.      Don't forget about the serving pieces. Silver trays, vintage egg plates for stuffed eggs, cabbage shaped bowls for coleslaw and platters with a carrot motif all contribute to the beauty of your Easter table. Plan ahead and visit your local hobby or department stores the days after Easter. You'll find great bargains for next spring's family table.

What I am observing is the importance of human contact. Families are reluctant and cautioned not to have their kids go to a friend’s house or spend the weekend with a relative. Partners can’t easily call up a friend and be gone for the day to blow off steam or just vent. Person-to-person contact is an interaction difficult to quantify but proven again and again to be healing and an essential part of the human condition. Kids need school and the social interaction it provides. Adults thrive being with other adults whether at work, school or among friends and family.

Julian Draxler believes revamped Germany are ready to regain their “old strength”.
 Germany finished bottom of their group at the 2018 World Cup but are rebuilding, with boss Joachim Low having cleared out a host of old guard stars.
 Low will miss Germany’s Euro 2020 qualifiers against Belarus and Estonia due to a contused artery that required hospital treatment, leaving assistant Marcus Sorg to take charge.
 Paris St Germain forward Draxler is back in Germany’s ranks for the first time in almost a year, and admitted to discovering a new feeling in the squad.
 “In November I had to miss out due to family reasons and then I was injured in March,” said Draxler, who was part of the Germany squad that won the 2014 World Cup.
 “It’s been a while since I’ve been part of the team and I’m very happy to be back again.
 “A lot has happened over the last few months. We’ve started to build up a new team.
 “Something had to happen after our bad World Cup showing. We are highly motivated and want to achieve big things during the next objectives that lie ahead of us.
 “It will take time until we’re back at the same level as the 2014 and 2016 teams, but if we keep working hard on ourselves then we have the potential to find our way back to our old strength.”
 Draxler expects a tough examination in Belarus on Saturday, calling on Germany’s new young stars to prove their worth as they look to make it two wins from two in Group C.
 “I’m still young and there is still room for improvement,” the 25-year-old Draxler told DFB.de.
 “I’m glad that I’m able to help build a new team.
 “We’re on the path to building a completely new team with a new hierarchy.
 “There are many new players on the team. With 50 caps, I obviously have a certain level of experience, but far be it from me to say that I’ll take over complete responsibility.
 “Everyone has to help out in order for us to be successful again—that goes for me as well.”
 Belarus boss Igor Kriushenko, whose team prop up Group C after losing both their opening two matches, admitted he could switch to a three-man defence in a bid to contain Germany.
 Kriushenko also conceded he had wanted to hand Denis Scherbitski a chance in goal only for the BATE Borisov keeper to be ruled out through injury.
 “We’ve analysed Germany; recently we have been playing more with two central defenders, but this option of three we’ll keep in mind,” said Kriushenko.
 “The final decision will be made on the day of the game.
 “Denis has long been among the candidates for the national team. I had wanted him to make his debut in a competitive game.”

The responsibility of deciding which warehouses stay up and running falls on state governments, many of which are being called on to close local facilities exposed to COVID-19. In Kentucky, an Amazon-owned Zappos facility was still operating after the state instituted a shelter-in-place rule, but Governor Andy Beshear stepped in and ordered it to close, citing sneaker returns were not an essential business.

Let's give you an update on where we are. Two. Use an overused term we are cautiously optimistic that we are slowing the infection rate that's what the numbers. Data suggests to us. Change in total hospitalizations. Is down. Not relative to yesterday but when it's averaged three day average on the hospitalizations. You see a dramatic decline in those numbers and that's. Obviously very good news change in icu admissions is actually a negative number for the first time since we. Started this intense journey. That means there are fewer people. In the intensive care units statewide. Then they wore. And again that's the first time we've seen. A negative number so that's good for three day average of that is is down. Changing into patience is. Little tick higher than it's been in the past few days but it's still all program. The three B averages also. Down the bid news is. We continue to lose a tremendous number. Lives and endure great pain as a state. 700 and certain step in lives lost. I understand intellectually. Why it's happening. It doesn't make it any easier. To accept. What's happening is the number of people came in two weeks ago when we have those very high hospitalization rates. He that you get treated and get better and get this charged or reduced pain. Hospital and probably wind up on a ventilator and the longer you're an event the later. That he less likely you'll come off the ventilator and that's what's happening now. These lives lost a people who came in at that height. Hospitalization period. And we're losing them. The numbers. Is lower. Than yesterday with those who can take. Solace in that track. As someone searches for solace. In all of this grief. The the leveling off. The number of lives lost is. Somewhat hopeful sign. The number of total lives lost 7844. Four people just to put this in perspective. I lived through 9/11 as many New Yorkers did. War of somewhat advanced stage. And I believe Nauru Evan was the worst. Situation that I was going to deal with in my lifetime. The to put in perspective 2753. People. Lost their lives on nine elevenths worked 7844. So. In terms of lives lost that this situation. Should exceed. 90 is still. Beyond. My capacity to fully appreciate the truth. We've been watching a spread to be suburban communities around New York City NASA suffered. Westchester Rockland. That seems to have stabilized we have a couple of hot spots in Suffolk County that we're watching. But overall. We've been. Very aggressive. In the suburban communities. In jumping on those hot spots and the percentage of growth in upstate new York and these suburban errors are in New York City has basically been stabilized and flat so that's good news to. So or rural New York is flattening the curve. And we have to flatten her. Because. When they show us the projection models. I'll walk to statisticians projected. To curb would do. We have no capacity. To meet. Those projections and other words. Columbia University who was projecting the highest caseload. Said we needed 136000. Hospital beds in New York City when we start. Whose it was just several weeks ago. 136000. Hospital that's in New York City we only have. About 33 to 36000. Hospital beds in New York's it. Seoul. That was obviously. Distressing to say the least. McKinsey had projected we would need 1101000. Hospital beds. They had a second scenario which they considered them moderate scenario which was 55000. Hospital beds statewide. And again. We didn't have that capacity even on the moderate scenario. The gates funded each him me. Suggested we needed 73000. Vets we didn't have that either so none of these projections. Were. In any way. Comforting to us the actual curve. Is much much lower than any of them project. And what what's the variance how do you come up with an actual curve that is so much different. Then what those experts. Predicted. First and fairness that the experts nobody has been here before know but. So everyone is trying to figured out the best they can. There is known models to track against. Second the big variable was what policies you put in place and a bigger variable was does anybody listening to the policies you put in place right. I'm governor of the State of New York via you can announce a policy that doesn't mean anyone is going to follow. You can announce a policy we're going to close Arnold businesses everybody must stay home. And if people don't follow it or they don't take it seriously or they believe you're being part premature war or you're being political they wouldn't follow. And I'm what do we do. What were you rest nineteen million people would take you nineteen million people so the big variable was. What policies you put in place and the bigger variable. Does anybody care and does anyone follow. And all of these social distancing stay at home nobody is ever done this before so. This statisticians had to come up with a premise on how many would comply. And we've actually exceeded that. Bot we have to keep doing it you know. People tend to think what this is it natural trajectory. Of the disease there is no match world trajectory. The trajectory is the trajectory that we Kariya eight by our actions. The natural trajectory. Would see that we continue to go up. It would continue to go up and up and up until you've developed herd immunity what you would see. Many many more infections so. We did that we are due wing that and that's why we have to stay the course.

BOONE — Appalachian State Athletic Director Doug Gillin told members of the media via video call that the App State athletic department is looking for ways to cut back on its budget without hurting the product.
 Gillin looks at the recent ban on playing college sports events as an opportunity to find ways to economize when it comes to expenses such as travel, which can eat up a budget. The recent cuts to revenue brought on by the lack of events will cut into the Sun Belt Conference’s budget, which will cut into the App State budget, according to Gillin.
 One of the possibilities to save expenses, as suggested by Gillin, is to consolidate Sun Belt Conference schedules, especially with sports such as baseball and softball. That would mean playing home-and-home series against division foes and eliminating games against the other divisional opponents. There are six teams in both divisions.
 Gillin said Appalachian State’s baseball team was forced to fly to three road series, which included series of three days each.
 “Some of the other sports, we’re taking three flights in conference,” Gillin said. “So one of the things that we’re really looking at from a conference standpoint is, ‘Can we just play divisional?’” Gillin said. “We’d play home- and-home. When we played baseball we had nine conference series and 27 games. Three of those were flights to Texas and Louisiana. Now, if you’re looking to go six-and-six, east and west, and all of a sudden you play the five teams on your side, that’s 30 conference games without a flight. That is an example and we’re looking at it with all sports.”
 Gillin said the Mountaineers have talked to other programs about playing interconference games, “whatever conference that might be.” The idea would be to play teams in series that were closer to the area and cut down on travel costs.
 “Does it make sense to go here or to go there when you can go down the road and play there, and their fans really like it when you come and they like it when they come here?” Gillin said. “There are some interesting conversations going on certainly in the non-conference. No planes, stay regional. And now in the conference, can we be east and west? That saves a considerable amount of money.”
 Gillin said the Mountaineers are looking to eliminate any non-conference event that needs the team to fly out except for those games that receive a big payout. The App State football team will have to fly to play at Wisconsin in 2020, but will receive a payout.
 Appalachian State’s other nonconference road football game in 2020 is at Wake Forest, which is within driving distance. App State also plays Sun Belt Conference games at Louisiana-Monroe and at Texas State, which require air travel to attend.
 Gillin also feels App State has scheduled well when it comes to playing teams that are driving distance away. App State played at Charlotte in 2018, will play at East Carolina in Charlotte and at Miami in 2021, at Marshall in 2022, at North Carolina in 2023 and at Clemson and East Carolina in 2024.
 Conversely, App State also plays at Texas A&M in 2022 and Wyoming in 2023, which is a return trip for the Mountaineers, who hosted Wyoming in 2015.
