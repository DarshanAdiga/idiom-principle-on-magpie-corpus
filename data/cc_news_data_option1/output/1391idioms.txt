Apple's iPhone 5s and 5c are pretty stylish on their own, but they can always look better. Fortunately, there is no shortage of iPhone covers that allow you to express yourself and, in many cases (pun intended), add some extra functionality.

A friend called the other day to let me know that she'd heard a hardware store in downtown Chicago had N95 masks in stock. They were selling them two for $19.95.
   
 I tried to persuade her not to rush out and buy them. Sitting on my high horse, I recited the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's guidelines, which stated that only people who have COVID-19 symptoms or are caring for a sick person should wear them.
   
 Furthermore, the masks were ridiculously overpriced. Before the pandemic, they were selling three for $6.99 on the company's website.
   
 "It's ridiculous to walk around wearing a mask if you don't need one," I said in my most authoritative voice. "In fact, the hardware store should be donating those masks to the hospitals that are facing a shortage."
   
 Before I could barely get off the phone, reports were coming about the CDC revising its guidelines. It appears that now, wearing a mask might be a good idea for everyone who has to go outside.
   
 Several weeks into the coronavirus crisis, some of us still aren't exactly sure what we should or shouldn't be doing. It's hard to keep up with all the edicts coming from so many different sources.
   
 The White House's message on masks has been particularly confusing.
   
 On one hand, we're hearing horror stories about nurses having to use masks multiple times because there aren't enough of them available to follow the normal protocol. Every day, there's a new report about a nurse or doctor getting exposed to the virus while caring for sick people.
   
 Certainly, no one wants to make it tougher on our health care workers. But it is going to be hard to get people not to hoard masks if the government says they might save your life.
   
 The CDC, the U.S. surgeon general and the World Health Organization started out on the same page regarding whether ordinary people should be walking around in masks. For weeks, they urged only people who are sick and coughing to wear them.
   
 While the WHO recently reiterated its stance, the White House and the CDC have reversed course.
   
 Far be it from me to criticize anyone for doing whatever he or she feels is necessary to ward off this deadly virus. If someone feels placing a bandanna over their mouth while grocery shopping will keep them healthy, then go for it.
   
 Lots of people are keeping busy these days creating homemade cloth masks to give to friends or donate to transit drivers, delivery people, store clerks and others who risk exposure in order to supply us with the things we need. Not only are they functional, some are pretty stylish to boot.
   
 But masks shouldn't give us the false sense of security that we can just go back to normal. As the weather warms up, more and more people will be tempted to get out and about. The surgeon general warned that masks aren't a substitute for social distancing.
   
 On a recent warm day, while taking my daily stroll through the neighborhood, so many people were out walking that it was impossible to keep the designated 6-foot distance. At one point a woman was walking behind me coughing up a storm. I decided to step off the sidewalk to allow her to pass. Then she stopped right in front of me to let her dog pee on a light pole.
   
 I felt uncomfortable and agitated. I ended up more stressed than I would have been had I stayed home and worked out on my elliptical.
   
 The coughing woman wasn't wearing a mask, and neither was I. At that moment, I wished both of us were. And I went home with a better understanding of why so many people do.

Mirror readers, I really pondered over what to write about for our Ed Board column this week. There is so much content out there, and it’s easy to feel a little overwhelmed or worry that there isn’t any more to say. Then, I just thought of something that makes me happy, that I could share with you all to maybe give you some happiness. Something that has always brought me a lot of joy is music, and more specifically making playlists. I love music and I always have, so it is true to say that it is a major part of my life. The amount of hours of the day that I spend with my headphones in and music playing are almost more than the time that I spend without them. The staff members of The Mirror know that I can’t edit or write anything without blasting music, usually the “Rock Classics” playlist on Spotify. To me, sharing music is one of the ultimate forms of love, so I love it when people play me new music, or when I get to share new music with my friends. When I first got close with my now best friend and roommate, Lauren, I realized that she had an absolutely amazing taste in music. One of the first things we ever did together was go see the documentary movie about Coldplay (during which we both cried like babies, and I don’t even like Coldplay that much). Then, one day we had the idea that we would make playlists for each other, and I was thrilled. Now fast forward one year later and those playlists have about 250 songs on them, and we have created a third playlist where we put the best songs from the original playlists. They get updated weekly and have a huge range of music on them, which is part of what makes them so interesting. It is so fun to open your playlist, hear new songs and talk about them, even though sometimes you don’t like one of the new songs (I am looking at you “Plug Walk”). Sometimes you will both hear the same song and immediately add it to the playlist, only to see that the exact same song is already on yours. This is also a great way to learn about new artists and genres that you never would have thought of before. Lauren and I keep talking about going to see the band Valley, which I never would have heard of without these playlists. I have gotten a much broader perspective on what music I like, and it has also made me much more open to listening to new types of music. This is a great way to stay connected with your friends, even when you can’t physically be together. In these times, we all need as many little pieces of joy and connection as we can get. So, give this a try with your bestie and find something amazing.

On March 10, a man named Cody Lee Pfister walked into a Missouri Walmart and filmed himself licking deodorant on one of the shelves.
 According to the statement of probable cause Warrenton police later used to secure a warrant for his arrest, Pfister turned to a phone camera and asked, "Who's scared of coronavirus?" before sticking out his tongue and "dragging it across approximately ten (10) containers on the shelf and a portion of the shelf itself."
 He and friends shared the video on social media, where it promptly went — well, viral — with 40,000 shares on Facebook and more on other platforms. Within days, the 26-year-old was charged with making a terrorist threat in the second degree, a felony.
 "It was idiotic, moronic, all those things," said Pfister's attorney, Patrick Coyne. "But was it felonious? That's going to be the question."
 Attorneys and law enforcement officials are suddenly grappling with questions like that one — if not precisely like that one — amid new regulations aimed at stopping the spread of COVID-19. As governors and mayors issue stay-at-home orders and ban gatherings, law enforcement personnel are tasked with making sure citizens comply with unprecedented restrictions on their freedom of movement and, in some cases, their livelihoods, during a crisis unlike any most have ever experienced. And they are doing so in full knowledge that to enforce laws meant to keep people apart, they must come in close contact with would-be violators.
 "Police are put in this unenviable position of trying to enforce that," said Chuck Wexler, head of the Police Executive Research Forum, a group of state and local police executives that researches ways to improve policing practices.

The liquid-cooled electric compressor hangs low on the left side of the engine between the turbos and the air-to-liquid intercooler. To increase throttle response, the electric blower generates boost while the turbos spool up to speed. Heck, wired up right it could produce boost even when the engine is turned off and cold. Add this latest trick in with the talents of direct injection, variable-valve timing, and smart-guy ignition timing, and the result is an astonishingly easygoing, ridiculously smooth, ludicrously responsive V-6.

Coronavirus Perú I La pelea entre Katty García y Karim Vidal quedó en standy by debido a la pandemia por el coronavirus. Parece que ambas se han tomado un descanso de sus peleas y retoman su relación. Por el momento han decidido compartir la custodia de su pequeño hijo. Parecía que no iban a llegar a ningún acuerdo, sin embargo, la pandemia del coronavirus logró que el corazón de ambas de ablande. Karim Vidal compartió un video donde se observa que juega con su hijo en la casa de Katty García. De inmediato, los rumores de una reconciliación se dispararon en redes sociales y aunque ambas han preferido mantener el silencio de momento, al menos ya han llegado a un consenso. “Estamos en momentos difíciles en el mundo, gente muere a diario y no solamente por la pandemia, también por carencias y muchas razones más. Cuando uno ve el dolor de los otros humanos, hace un alto a todos los impulsos y acciones negativas y creo que nuestra responsabilidad es cuidar de Luis Antonio”, escribió Karim Vidal en Instagram. Los usuarios de redes sociales consultaron con Katty García y le preguntaron si había perdido la custodia del menor, sin embargo, la modelo respondió muy tajante que su hijo seguía viviendo con ella. “Para todas las personas que me están preguntando por mi hijito, acá está mi hijito, nadie me lo ha quitado.

While many businesses have closed their doors during the health crisis, gasoline stations and convince stores remain essential businesses and are still open. However, a large number of them have shuttered their bathrooms, making it difficult for nurses who have to travel long distances to find a place to use the restroom. That's something the staff at both Cherokee Nation Home Health Services and Angels Care Home Health have had to deal with.
 “They drive all the way back to the office if they’re not close by their house to come to the bathroom,” said Alicia Valle, branch director at the Tahlequah site. “It’s a problem.”
 Some patients for Angels Care have also waived their visits, for the time being. About a third of the patients seen by the Tahlequah entity have done so. In those situations, Valle said, phones calls are being placed to ensure patients are OK. She also said the home health provider has been contacting former, discharged patients to see if they have any questions or need assistance.
 “We’ve made a bunch of phone calls to our current patients and previous patients that we’ve had,” said Valle. “We’ve had several patients on hold right now, waiting for this virus to past. They’re not letting nurses or anyone in at this point, and we completely understand that, and they’re probably patients that have family that’s helping them and are able to go without a nurse.”
 The Angels Care Home Health staff has been in contact with local hospitals. Valle said health facilities are trying to determine which agencies are taking COVID-19 patients so they can free up beds for more critical patients. While there was a shortage of PPE at one point, she said supplies and equipment have since started to come in more frequently, which the nurse who visits a COVID-19 patient likely appreciates.
 “We accepted a COVID patient, probably the first one in our company to be accepted, last week,” said Valle. “The nurse went in and admitted them, wearing her full PPE, of course.”

 "On board the aircraft carrier _Charles de Gaulle_ currently deployed in the Atlantic as part of the Mission Foch, around forty sailors are today under close medical observation," the French Ministry of the Armed Forces said in an official statement. "They are showing symptoms consistent with possible COVID-19 infection. These first symptoms have appeared recently."
 The French military has dispatched a screening team with specialized equipment to the carrier, which is sailing in the Mediterranean now, to begin testing members of the crew. The official statement also says individuals who are showing symptoms of the virus have been placed in isolation, but does not elaborate on the exact nature of their confinement. They have received masks and medical personnel are checking on their condition twice a day.
  _Charles de Gaulle_ does have robust medical facilities with a dedicated containment suite, as well as a sickbay with a dozen beds. A 20-person medical team, which includes doctors, surgeons, and nurses, staffs these facilities on board the ship. Thankfully, so far, the sailors who may have contracted COVID-19 are exhibiting mild symptoms.

The Canadian Civil Liberties Association (CCLA) is already decrying what they call "unfair and arbitrary" enforcement. Michael Bryant, their executive director, even sent an open letter to Ottawa Mayor Jim Watson and Ottawa's police chief Peter Sloly to point out how the nation's capital is going particularly overboard.
 A recent story in the Ottawa Citizen explained how a man took his autistic young son to an open green space to play ball. Despite there being not another human being in sight, a bylaw enforcement officer showed up and told the man what he was doing came with a $700 fine.
 This is unacceptable. It should not be happening. There are so many problems in society right now that need to be addressed and that was not one of them.
 "When enforcement is unfair and arbitrary, people become less compliant and more defiant. We cannot police our way out of a pandemic," the CCLA wrote in a social media post.
 They argued that finding a homeless man several hundred dollars for violating social distancing rules - which happened in Hamilton the other day - benefits no one. They are right.
 When rules don't make sense, people stop listening to those in authority. When laws are unworkable or indecipherable, people ignore them," the CCLA added. "Trying to police our way out of this pandemic is unimaginative, sometimes unconstitutional, and ineffective."
 Let's be smart about these rules. The warm weather is coming up and officials are pre-emptively chastising Canadians to insist they keep inside.
 Is that right though? Maybe a wiser strategy would be for public health officials to recommend tactics as to how one can enjoy the warm weather with families while still following social distancing rules.
 It's important government remembers that they still serve us.

Even though Bitcoin has a long way to go until it is widely accepted, I believe that it is a very good investment that people should include in their portfolios. When Bitcoin was invented there was only a supply of 21 billion. Unlike cash, you cannot print more. This prevents Bitcoin from inflation. Many people, including myself, compare bitcoin to gold. I consider it to be digital gold. But, it differs from gold in that gold’s supply is unknown. Miners could discover thousands of pounds of gold tomorrow, which would drive the price of gold way down because the supply is much greater than originally thought.

We checked out of our hotel early that morning and to kill time walked around the Mall of America for what felt like a year. I remember spending a lot of that day trying to think about literally anything other than how much time was left until the game tipped later that night.
 A year wasting time in that mall that day, one year later now, feels like a decade ago. So much has changed in the world and in life since the Wahoos beat Texas Tech to win their first national championship in men’s hoops.
 But that day and especially that night feels like it just happened.
 And it still feels surreal.
   
 The next day, I wrote a column that I’m pretty sure remains the best thing I’ve ever done. I had this idea, sometime after the UMBC loss, to keep that audio and revisit it down the road. I didn’t know, of course, that it would be the next spring but a part of me wondered if maybe that’s how it might play out.
 Then we got everything that happened, from the Gardner-Webb comeback, to The Play, to the three free throws, to the title.

However, unlike some programs across the country struggling to make ends meet, McCaw said Liberty has offset its revenue shortfall and is “in a good place” heading into the 2020-21 athletic year.
 “We’re in a much better position to weather challenging times than most other higher education institutions,” McCaw said during a press conference held on Zoom, a video teleconference service.
 The NCAA was projected to distribute a little less than $600 million directly to Division I conferences and schools for 2020, but reduced that amount to $225 million because of the cancellation of the winter and spring sports championships. The amount paid out to the ASUN Conference and Liberty was not made available.
 The biggest hit came with the cancellation of the men’s basketball tournament, which Liberty had qualified for as the ASUN Conference Tournament champion.
 “Basically, the cancellation of the men’s basketball tournament means that the revenue distribution from the NCAA is going to be about 37 cents on the dollar from what we’ve previously received. In our case, that’s going to represent a high six-figure loss of revenue,” McCaw said. “In addition to that, we’re going to have a shortfall on ASUN revenue, and we had some baseball ticket refunds as well.
 “When you put all that together, we have pretty close to seven figures of lost revenue.”
 With the spring season ending 2½ months early, LU saved on those expenses. Those savings helped offset the six- to seven-figure losses that have resulted from the COVID-19 pandemic, according to McCaw.
 The expenses for Liberty’s spring sports programs in 2018-19 were about $2.2 million, according to Equity in Athletics Data Analysis.
 A large portion of those expenses came from travel to ASUN-member institutions located in New Jersey, Florida, Alabama, Georgia and Tennessee. Another portion, albeit smaller, was represented in staffing home events and tournaments.
 “We’re fortunate that we had savings to offset [the lost revenue],” McCaw said. “We’ve been diligent in terms of being good stewards of the resources that we have, so we’ve been able to find savings created by the fact that our spring teams didn’t travel, along with our operating expenses. We didn’t need to pay for home contests management and some expenses that go along with hosting games. That’s worked out well.”
