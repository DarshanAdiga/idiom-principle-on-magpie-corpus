Barcelona manager Ronald Koeman wants his side to keep the ball possession as that will keep Ronaldo away from scoring.
 “We need to try and keep hold of the ball, because as long as we’ve got the ball, [Ronaldo] can’t score,” Koeman said to the press ahead of the much- awaited match.

For starters, many people will likely fall through the cracks in this massive change due to confusion about the new process. That’s what happened in states that shifted from the federal marketplace to a state-based marketplace or vice versa, a transition much simpler for consumers than what Georgia is attempting.

“When the same Commission’s returning officers have declared the results in the various constituencies. Why is it that collation has not started? And the Electoral Commission still insists that it will be declaring elections two hours from now.


--DocBreak--
Today is “Safe Harbor Day,” and its explanation is a little long in the telling. First of all, people technically did not vote for Joe Biden or Donald Trump last November. They voted for Electoral College electors who will soon represent those voters in the final certification of the results. This is important, because the nightmare presidential election of 1876 exposed the lack of any legal mechanism to deal with rogue slates of electors being presented as legitimate by states disputing the outcome of an election.

  # $3 million lottery ticket sold in Hopewell Township


  Scott Tady


  Beaver County Times


  HOPEWELL TWP. — A scratch-off lottery ticket purchased in Hopewell Township has made someone $3 million richer.


  The Pennsylvania Lottery announced Tuesday that a top-prize winning $3 Million Extravaganza Scratch-Off ticket was bought at Caivano's Discount Tobacco Outlet, 2284 Brodhead Road, in the Hopewell Shopping Center.


  $3 Million Extravaganza Scratch-Offs cost $30 each.


  Caivano's receives a $10,000 bonus for selling the winning ticket.


  The state Lottery hasn't identified a winner, who stepped forward with the winning ticket Monday.


  At least two other $1 million-or-more Pennsylvania Lottery tickets have been sold in Beaver County this year.


  A month ago, someone scratched off a winning $1 million PA Millionaire's Club Scratch-Off ticket bought at the Wal-Mart in Center Township. Those tickets cost $20 a pop.


  A Pennsylvania Lottery Fast Play ticket worth more than $1.2 million was sold Feb. 25 at Darlington Beer Distribution off Old Darlington Road.

Mr Asiedu Nketia told a packed conference of NDC supporters and the media personnel that since 1992, the convention has been that election results reach the National Collation Centre when they are declared on the field.

“Transparency requires that when the results trickle in they are certified and made available to the public so that everybody can follow the results.


--DocBreak--
He said the NDC is worried that collation has not started at some regional offices, about 24 hours after the close of polls.
