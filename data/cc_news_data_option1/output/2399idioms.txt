When healthy, Newton is still an above-average quarterback who oozes big-play ability and keeps defensive coordinators up at night trying to find ways to contain his explosive arm and quick yet powerful legs.
 However, Newton has not shown he can stay healthy as of late, scaring teams off from his $19 million a year salary, which is team friendly for a starting quarterback under today’s salary cap but far too expensive for a backup. Newton is not only too talented to be a backup but also too charismatic. Newton has one of the most infectious smiles sports has ever seen — rivaling only Magic Johnson — making him a magnet to his teammates and coaches. That could dampen the confidence of whomever he would back up.
 The past two seasons have been cut short for Newton due to shoulder injuries.
 Newtown looked to be in constant pain throwing the football due to a torn labrum in his throwing shoulder in 2018. He rushed back too quickly, causing him to miss most of the 2019 season as well.
 While Newton has said he feels good and ready to go, the coronavirus has put team evaluations on hold for now. The impatience of not being on a team has clearly gotten to Newton, who has consistently been posting himself working out on social media in an attempt to prove he is ready to play.

Time to see if a fan-favorite series made the cut for another season. It's renewal time, and these 16 shows are getting another chance.  Some of these series we know all of the busy moms out there love to wind down and watch at the end of the day with a glass of wine. Time is valuable, and we don't waste it on bad TV.
 Now that we've binge-watched our way through Netflix, it's time for something new.
 Hopefully, production companies can open back up soon so these new seasons are on screens as soon as possible. (Networks are just as anxious as we are to get their content out there.) Some producers have already taken the leap of faith and are opening up. Tyler Perry revealed that he will start filming his shows again in his Atlanta-based studio. Surely, the rest of the networks and producers out there will follow suit.

I’m, of course, speaking of the Iron Bowl in 1989 that was played on Auburn’s campus for the first time in series history. It was a good game. It was an entertaining game, but the final score — 30-20 Auburn — is actually irrelevant.
 Well, maybe it’s not totally irrelevant. I’ll admit the memory and game itself would be significantly flawed if the Tigers had lost, but the significance of it would still have major relevance.
 To be perfectly honest, the game is kind of a blur to me. I distinctly remember the long pass to Alexander Wright on the first drive and James Joseph diving over the top into the end zone, behind which I was sitting, in the third quarter. I vividly remember the Shane Wasden catch and run that led to the Joseph touchdown with Wasden being tripped up from behind by a diving Keith McCants.
 Mostly, I remember desperately wanting the clock to run out after the Tigers built a 27-10 lead.
 I was also one of the estimated 20,000 at Tiger Walk and it was the most charged atmosphere I had ever experienced. That is, until we entered the stadium. It was so intense and so loud and the sky was literally a haze of blue from the paper shakers.

"Lovers' Quarrell," the penultimate episode of _Harley Quinn_ 's second season, dropped earlier today and featured a whole lot of action. After last week's episode saw the return of the Justice League, the team of heroes came together this week in order to stop the parademons being controlled by Doctor Psycho. In an attempt to save Gotham, there were some epic showdowns between the Justice League and Harley's crew, who were all being mind-controlled by Doctor Psycho. Clayface, King Shark, and Ivy all faced off with the heroes, but in the end, only Harley could save the day.
 Turns out, Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman were no match for Ivy. Doctor Psycho had Ivy use her pheromones on the heroes, so we last saw them in some compromising positions. Superman was admiring his own pecks while Wonder Woman was suggesting to Batman that they discover what's underneath their costumes. Leaving the heroes to their sexual escapades, the mind-controlled Ivy took Harley to Psycho so he could kill her and present her head to Darkseid. Harley and Ivy have an epic showdown, but a kiss from Harley ultimately snaps Ivy out of Doctor Psycho's spell. Together, the best friends/lovers take down Doctor Psycho and save the day. However, the villain gets one last laugh when he exposes Harley and Ivy's relationship, leaving the episode on a love triangle cliffhanger.
 Next week's episode is titled "The Runaway Bridesmaid," so we have to assume Ivy is going to choose Kite Man and proceed with the wedding... at least for now. It's no surprise that Harley and Ivy's romantic tension has continued to build throughout the season considering the series' showrunners previously talked about transforming the characters from best friends to lovers. "We tried to play the reality of how messy, uncomfortable, and awkward it would be to figure out that you're in love with your best friend. It's messy, it takes a while, and it's not smooth at all. And there are definitely a lot of two steps forward, one step back kind of thing going on," Justin Halpern explained.
 What did you think of "Lovers' Quarrell?" Do you think we'll see the aftermath of the Justice League's pheromone-induced behavior? Tell us in the comments!
 The season two finale of _Harley Quinn_ drops next Friday, June 26th, on DC Universe.

_Coaches Corner is a series of stories about a variety of issues that coaches must deal with on and off the playing surface. Today, how do local coaches feel about the possible use of a shot clock in high school basketball? The Georgia High School Association is set to vote on the addition of a shot clock during a June 23 meeting of the state executive committee._
 Keri O’Neal hasn’t coached a game in her new position as Murray County High School’s girls basketball coach, but the rules may change before she does.
 A meeting of the Georgia High School Association is set for June 23, when the state executive committee is expected to take a vote on whether to add a 30-second shot clock for high school basketball.
 “My first year in, I’d definitely like to test the waters first, but I can definitely see the good and bad of it,” O’Neal said of the proposal.
 The plan would see the three-year phase-in of the shot clock. For the upcoming season, the shot clock would be used only in specific holiday tournament and showcase games. In year two, regions would be given the choice of whether to use the 30-second clock. In 2022-23, the shot clock would become mandatory for all GHSA-governed schools.
 “As a coach, I wouldn’t mind it,” said Ryan Scoggins, the boys basketball coach at Dalton High School. “I like a faster pace of play, so that kind of matches up with a shot clock.”
 Shot clocks are not new to the game of basketball. The NBA has used a shot clock since 1954, and the NCAA adopted it for all universities in 1985.
 As of last basketball season, eight states — California, Maryland, Massachusetts, New York, North Dakota, Rhode Island, South Dakota and Washington — had statewide use of a shot clock.
 A shot clock was used at a few high school exhibition games in Georgia as an experiment last season, including the Hawks-Naismith Tipoff Classic in November in Atlanta.
 Christian Heritage School boys basketball coach Tyler Watkins said the shot clock would have a minor effect on most of the game for many schools.
 “Let’s be honest, most high schools already aren’t taking 30 seconds to get through their offense,” Watkins said.

John F. Lee of Bradenton, Florida, formerly of Wysox, Pennsylvania and Montoursville, Pennsylvania died Wednesday, June 10, 2020 after a brief illness.
 John was born Nov. 5, 1953 in Towanda, Pennsylvania, son of Robert E. and Eleanor Woodruff Lee. John graduated from Towanda Area High School in 1971 and continued his career in business management at Williamsport School of Commerce. He was business manager at West Middleton, Canton Area, Montoursville, S. Williamsport and Octorara school districts.
 John possessed a generous and loving personality, a sense of humor and was a friend to everyone he met. He especially loved his faith in our Lord and his family. He enjoyed playing golf and was a coach and referee for high school soccer. He was host to several members of the Crosscutters Baseball Team for several years. He also hosted a foreign exchange student from Norway while with the Montoursville School District, and traveled to Norway to meet his family. John enjoyed travel and visited several countries, the most important to him being Italy, where he attended mass with Pope John Paul II.
 He was a member of Saint Ann Catholic Church in Williamsport, Pennsylvania and an “Extraordinary Minister of Holy Communion” at “Our Lady of Angels” Catholic Church in Bradenton.

The great Bear Bryant was adamantly against moving the game from Legion Field. In fact, he vowed it wouldn’t happen if he had anything to do with it. Tide coach (83-86) Ray Perkins, who was there from 1983-86, defiantly and assuredly stated it would never happen.
 Auburn head coach and, more importantly, athletic director Pat Dye felt otherwise.
 I can understand how it would be difficult for someone under 30 to truly appreciate the gravity of the game. The absurdity of one SEC team patently refusing to play an away game on another SEC team’s home turf is bizarre and completely foreign to someone today. I look back on it now and it seems ridiculous to me, but that was fairly common across the country pre-1990.
 It made sense to play the Iron Bowl at Legion Field for a time when it was the largest stadium in the state. The two schools renewed the rivalry in 1948 after a 40-year hiatus and agreed to a “neutral site” in ’48 and ’49. Alabama won in 1948 and Auburn won in 1949. All went well, so the contract was renewed again and again and again.
 The only problem was Alabama played half their home schedule at Legion Field every year. Despite the ranting and raving of disingenuous alumni and fans, the game was never played at a “neutral site.”

“I don’t know for how many offenses it would really matter a whole lot,” Scoggins said.
 When the shot clock will come more into play, the coaches said, is late in the game.
 “I kind of like the aspect of being able to come back a little bit more quickly if you’re down late. The other team won’t be able to hold the ball,” Watkins said.
 O’Neal has experience coaching as an assistant at the collegiate level in stops at Morehead State University and Belhaven University, where shot clocks were in use.
 “That would mean more possessions for each team,” O’Neal said. “Teams would have to think about strategy a little more late in the game instead of holding the ball and slowing the game up.”
 “It’ll take more practice time to prepare kids for when the clock gets down under 10 seconds,” Watkins said. “They’ll need to know what to do to get a shot.”
 One positive of a shot clock, O’Neal said, would be getting high school basketball on the same page with colleges.
 “It would help get kids ready for competition in college if they want to go on,” she said.
 One challenge would be each school having to install a shot clock system and finding personnel to properly operate it. Systems can cost anywhere from $2,000 to $5,000.
 “That’s just one more thing to have to add,” Scoggins said.

Autorickshaw and taxi drivers and bus workers in the city have started adopting improved safety measures as a precaution against COVID-19. And they are going at it hammer and tongs to protect themselves and passengers from the disease.
 With public transportation services limping back to normalcy in non- containment zones, operators are taking extra safety steps, taking into account the increasing number of commuters.
 A protective plastic screen between the driver and passengers is the latest addition in autorickshaws in Kozhikode city. About 4,000 vehicles are likely to fit the screen to ensure physical distancing. This is in addition to the handwashing facility in autos.
 Face shield is likely to be promoted among a large number of bus drivers and workers. Though it is expensive compared to masks, many are opting for it because of safety concerns. Disallowing passengers who are not wearing masks or refusing to follow the physical-distancing norm too has become a daily practice.
 However, Sajeev Kumar, leader of an autorickshaw drivers’ union in the city, says people are voluntarily cooperating with precautionary measures along with drivers. “We have not come across any situation in which a passenger hesitates to follow norms. Though the physical-distancing concept is not financially viable for taxi service providers, they are strictly following it,” he adds.
 Bus operators in the city say there is an increase in the number of commuters now in Kozhikode. Operators even have kept additional masks and sanitisers with them in case any traveller needs them.
 The Motor Vehicles Department and the police too are closely monitoring vehicles to ensure compliance with safety protocol, suggestions on healthy ventilation and the break-the-chain campaign.

 On Thursday, two of the ship’s aviators ejected from their F/A-18 fighter jet while conducting a training flight and were rescued in the Philippine Sea and found to be in good condition. The incident is under investigation and it's not clear whether the crew’s long layoff in Guam or rapid return to sea played any role in the crash.
 The Roosevelt’s experience with the virus, however, spurred the development of widespread cleaning and health precautions across the military. And it also gave federal health authorities a population of sailors to test, providing greater insight into the science and the spread of the virus.

LOS ANGELES (AP) — The nation’s largest movie theater chain changed its position on mask-wearing less than a day after the company became a target on social media for saying it would defer to local governments on the issue.AMC Theaters CEO Adam Aron said Friday that its theaters will require patrons to wear masks upon reopening, which will begin in mid-July. Customers who don’t wear masks won’t be admitted or allowed to stay.“We think it is absolutely crucial that we listen to our guests,” Aron said. “It is clear from this response that we did not go far enough on the usage of masks.”Rival chain Regal followed AMC's lead. Spokesman Richard Grover said Friday that moviegoers must wear masks in all its theaters as well.AMC Theaters wasn’t the first to say it would defer to officials on the mask issue. That policy was identical to what Cinemark announced earlier this month. Cinemark did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Most major retailers require masks for customers only where local rules mandate it.But the AMC plan hit a nerve for many on Thursday and #boycottAMC quickly became a trending topic on Twitter.The outrage was further flamed by one of Aron’s comments in an interview with the Hollywood trade Variety that implied that taking a hard stance on mask-wearing was a political matter.“We did not want to be drawn into a political controversy,” Aron said. “We thought it might be counterproductive if we forced mask wearing on those people who believe strongly that it is not necessary.”He also said that he thought the “vast majority of AMC guests will be wearing masks” and that he planned to lead by example and would be wearing a mask himself.The interview came on the same day that California started requiring people throughout the state to wear masks in most indoor settings and outdoors when distancing isn’t possible.While public health officials say wearing a mask is important in helping stop the spread of COVID-19, not wearing one has become a political statement for people who say it violates their freedom or exaggerates the threat of the coronavirus. President Donald Trump has pushed back against masks, even as the virus has killed more than 100,000 Americans this year.Earlier Friday, Alamo Drafthouse, which operates around 40 locations in the U.S. said that it would be requiring that guests wear masks at its theaters, with a caveat for eating and drinking. Those without masks, it said, would be given one. AMC plans to sell masks for $1.Most indoor U.S. theaters have been closed since mid-March because of COVID-19. But both independent locations and major chains are readying to reopen within the next month.AMC said it will open 450 of its U.S. locations on July 15, with the goal of having most of its theaters in operation by July 24 for the opening of Disney’s “Mulan” and Christopher Nolan’s “Tenet” the following week.Copyright 2020 Associated Press.

According to “The Oxford Encyclopedia of Food and Drink” (Oxford, $125), casseroles of one sort or another have been around since prehistoric times, adding that they took on a distinctive American identity along the way. Many ingredients were scarce during World War I and leftovers were turned into casserole meals. The same was true during The Great Depression of the '30s. But for many, it’s the ubiquitous tuna-potato chip casserole of the '50s or the holiday green bean casserole that come to mind. Or maybe a ground meat and Tater Tot concoction.

"Many are yet to appreciate that there is a new normal that demands a new way of life that is not optional and is also an individual responsibility in the final analysis. I wish to emphasise that the figures of the dead from COVID-19 related complications or the sick may appear to many as just mere statistics, but to those who are directly impacted, these are not just numbers, but caring spouses, loving fathers or mothers, sisters, brothers and cherished relatives.

At least on paper. In practice the hybrid is the least OMG feature of the Sonatas I’ve tested. And it still leaves me thirsting for the Sonata N performance version that will couple the car’s tight handling with an alleged 295 horsepower. I tasted the N earlier this year on windy roads through Arizona and it was a treat.
 Until its arrival, drivetrains aren’t the Sonata’s strong suit. And that’s not just because I’ve got a lead foot instead of a green thumb. Indeed, I’ve been impressed by the industry’s latest hybrids, particularly new value entries from compact SUVs like the Ford Escape, Honda CRV and Toyota RAV4, which have exhibited feisty character even as they sipped gas from the pump.

The ruling YSR Congress bagged all the four Rajya Sabha seats in Andhra Pradesh and seasoned campaigners like Digvijaya Singh, Jyotiraditya Scindia and Shibu Soren had an easy sailing as the results of the polls to the upper house were on expected lines barring Gujarat and Manipur which went down to the wire. Voting was held for 19 seats spread across eight states amid all precautionary measures in view of the COVID-19 pandemic which led to two legislators in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan who were in quarantine turning up in PPE gear.

Gilbert said he was inspired to protest when one of his employees was hit by a police officer recently.
 While some folks expect business owners to stay silent on issues like racism and police brutality, he’s not.
 “Money is money,” he said before the march started. “I know we need it, but at the end of the day, what matters is we’re all in this world together.”
 The Dirty Buffalo also donated money to Park Place School and a local bail fund called Humanities Behind Bars.
 Gilbert has two children, ages 6 and 3. His sister has biracial children whose father is black. The way they raise their kids is different due to systemic racism, he said.
 He doesn’t have to worry about his children being being judged as they walk down the street with their candy, he said during a speech before the march started. His sister has to have different conversations with her kids.
 “You’re going to have to teach your kids what? How to act when you get pulled over for a broken tail light?” he said.
 What he does teach his kids, he said, is the real version of history — the part that’s not white-washed, he said. He thinks white people need to accept responsibility for what their race did rather than masking it.

Geoff Keighley, the organizer of the Summer Game Fest events, tweeted on Friday about a new game announcement planned for June 22nd that'll also feature gameplay. There was no mention of Crash Bandicoot, so it could very well be a different game entirely, but it lines up nicely with what's already expected from the rumors so far.
 Crash's return in a new game is something people have been requesting for some time now considering how popular the _N. Sane Trilogy_ and other retro returns like the Spyro games have been. Some merchandise leaks spotted not long ago indicated that a new game might be in the works, but that was all Crash Bandicoot hopefuls had to go off of until now. Much more official teasers surfaced recently with press members and content creators getting puzzles that directly referenced Crash Bandicoot. All those teasers culminated in what we know now, that there's definitely a game out that that's been rated and that we'll supposedly see it revealed soon.
 This reveal on Monday will share the day with another event planned by Nintendo. The next _Super Smash Bros. Ultimate_ DLC character, the one from _ARMS_ , will be revealed on the same day. Smash's will come first with the Summer Game Fest announcement happening immediately afterwards, so people will have time to tune into the first and head into the next right away.

“When 720 was released, that was the most exciting thing in the skate world, I tried to buy a machine and I couldn’t afford it. That was the closest I got to a video game was with 720. And I guess ironically, way down the line when our series started hitting, I went and bought myself a [720] cabinet just to show that I’ve come full circle.”
