Poet Maya Angelou once wrote, "Love recognizes no barriers. It jumps hurdles, leaps fences, penetrates walls to arrive at its destination full of hope."
   
 Angelou didn't figure on COVID-19, which has mounted a formidable challenge to her truism. The barriers and obstacles it has created -- like business closures, stay-at-home orders, and strict limits on social gatherings -- are bringing the $54-billion-a-year wedding industry to its bended knees.
   
 But love is still finding a way where marriage licenses are concerned, thanks to select Pennsylvania counties -- Bucks being among them -- that have begun allowing licenses to be issued virtually via videoconferencing platforms.
   
 When the coronavirus shut down much of the Commonwealth, other counties moved the process online, too, including York, Centre, Washington, Dauphin and Philadelphia. But a few of those, including York and Philadelphia, offer it only to their own residents.
   
 We give the Bucks County Register of Wills' Linda Bobrin and her office credit for not only using technology to continue fulfilling one of its key functions, but also for allowing residents from anywhere in Pennsylvania to apply.
   
 Bobrin's first deputy, Douglas Wayne, said the initiative has left everyone in the office feeling good at a time when most of the news is bad.
   
 "It's been great just being able to participate in something that unites people," he said.
   
 And the response has been strong. Bobrin said her office has been helping about 20 couples a day.
   
 We believe that safeguarding couples' ability to tie the knot throughout the year is important.
   
 The romantics among us gravitate to the idea that couples who can't wait to begin their happily-ever-after shouldn't have to sit tight until we've weathered a pandemic. They want to live in a world where love conquers all with the help of people like Bobrin.
   
 The more pragmatic among us point out that not every committed couple has the luxury of waiting for a storybook wedding day. That's especially true in the midst of COVID-19.
   
 Now is not the time to be uninsured, and with so many losing their health care coverage due to coronavirus-related job losses, some see getting married as the best way to add a significant other to their plans.
   
 There are also immunocompromised people working in high-risk occupations -- like first responders and front-line health care workers -- who wish to marry to ensure their significant other can access all the rights granted to the spouse of someone who is gravely ill and could die.
   
 Upcoming military deployments and expiring visas also continue to spur the need to obtain marriage licenses without delay.
   
 As long as it is done with the proper protections against fraud, we see the Register of Wills office's videoconferencing technology as a great tool that's helping couples from all over Pennsylvania move their relationships forward despite being otherwise stuck in place.
   
 Bobrin and her team have been calling this a "pilot program." We hope that means they intend to continue to expand the use of Zoom for marriage license applications even after the coronavirus is stamped out and county offices are, once again, open to the public.
   
 It's an idea whose time has come. It just took the coronavirus to get it off the ground.

The Real Kashmir Football Club, that has made its mark in the sport, stepped in to help the Jammu and Kashmir administration as well as the army by providing Personal Protection Equipments and masks for health workers to fight the novel coronavirus.
 Sandeep Chattoo, owner of the football club, on Monday handed over 150 PPE kits, 3,000 gloves and 15,000 surgical masks to Deputy Commissioner of Srinagar Shahid Iqbal Choudhary, who has been at the forefront of the fight against Covid-19 after the first case surfaced in the district on March 18.
 Chattoo thanked Choudhary for the exemplary work done by him and his team in containing the disease and taking all proactive steps to prevent its spread.
 “I wanted to personally hand over to DC as he has been leading the team from the front. Very few of us know that he stays away from his family, living barely a kilometer away so that he could serve people of the district. Now the onus lies on us and we should ensure that we strictly adhere to the orders of the government and stay indoors,” Chattoo, who also owns the hotel CH2, said.
 RKFC gave 150 Personal Protection Equipment kits, 3,000 gloves and 15,000 surgical masks to the district administration.
 He said the material handed over was a “small token of gesture to the massive efforts” being undertaken by the Srinagar district administration led by the Deputy Commissioner under the able guidance of Chief Secretary BVR Subrahmanyam and overall supervision of Lt Governor of Jammu and Kashmir G C Murmu.
 “I am aware of the fact that this humble offer of contribution in our fight against the pandemic may be a drop in the ocean but at this critical period, we all should come forward and help in whatever way we can.
 “With the threat due to the pandemic looming large over the entire globe, what worries me is the safety of our health workers, who are the frontline warriors in this fight. We at the RKFC salute these doctors, nurses and other health care workers who have been working selflessly and relentlessly even at the peril of putting their lives at risk,” Chattoo said.
 Earlier, Chattoo handed over 150 PPE kits and 10,000 surgical face masks to the army at the BB Cantonment for use at the 92 Base hospital, the backbone of health care to officers, jawans and security forces in the strategically-based XV Corps. Even civilians are treated in some of the cases. The consignment was handed over to senior officers of the army.
 Later, Lt Gen BS Raju, General Officer-in Command of XV Corps, appreciated the gesture of Chattoo and said this shows the deep bond that exists between Awam (public), army and security forces in the Kashmir Valley.
 “The bond is strong between all of us and such gesture from good samaritan is deeply appreciated and I am sure together we will be able to fight COVID-19,” Lt Gen Raju said.

It's unclear how fully British lawmakers will be able to scrutinize the Conservative government under the new digital arrangements. Not everything can be done from a distance. Approving legislation is on hold because there is not yet a way for lawmakers to vote. In the House of Commons, that is done by the time-honored and time-consuming method of having legislators traipse out of the Commons chamber and walk through “yes” or “no” lobbies.
 Hoyle said Commons authorities are “urgently” seeking a way that voting can be done remotely.
 The pandemic has already upended everyday activity in the cramped, crumbling parliamentary complex, where several thousand people work, served by multiple bars and restaurants, a post office and a hairdresser. Even before parliamentarians were sent home on March 25, Hoyle had suspended the sale of alcohol on the premises, to encourage staff not to linger.
 The virtual arrangements are likely to curb Parliament's spontaneity and subdue its often raucous atmosphere. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Conservative lawmaker who serves as leader of the House of Commons, accepted that “the new digital Parliament will not be perfect.” But he said “we must not let the perfect be the enemy of the good.”
 And, he added, things have been worse.
 “In 1349, the Black Death forced Parliament not to sit,” Rees-Mogg wrote. “Today, we can do better thanks to technology, Mr. Speaker and a determination to keep our democracy going.”
 Meg Russell, director of the Constitution Unit at University College London, said the new arrangements were “unique and unprecedented.” But she said politics would be more difficult without “face to face and informal contact.”

PARIS (AP) — Media watchdog Reporters Without Borders is sounding the alarm that the coronavirus pandemic poses a threat for press freedom around the world.
 In its annual evaluation of global media freedoms, the group warned Tuesday that the health crisis could serve as an excuse for governments “to take advantage of the fact that politics are on hold, the public is stunned and protests are out of the question, in order to impose measures that would be impossible in normal times.”
 North Korea ranked bottom of the group's press freedom index. As in 2019, Norway again topped its ranking of 180 countries and territories.
 Overall, the report judged press freedom to be “satisfactory" in the United States, but also said “public denigration, threats, and harassment of journalists continued to be a serious problem” last year. The U.S. ranked 45th on the group's list, behind countries in Europe, Africa, Asia, Oceania, Latin America and the Caribbean.
 The report highlighted U.S. President Donald Trump's hostility toward some journalists and media outlets and said his oft-deployed “fake news” phrase “has now been deployed by leaders around the world as a tool to crack down on the media.”
 “Hostility toward journalists and news outlets in the United States deepened and intensified, and few attacks were as vitriolic as those that came from the president," the group said. “The abuse is only getting worse amid the coronavirus pandemic in 2020, as journalists covering the Trump administration’s response to the crisis are subjected to the president’s attacks during his press briefings.”

An Australian missionary has been found not guilty of criminal fraud by a provincial court in Kandal, ending a four-year ordeal which began with the construction of a school and included a three month stint in prison.
 Chan was not at the trial, after repeated delays.
 He said he was at home cooking lunch when his lawyer, who represented him in court on Tuesday, rang with the good news.
 "I was elated," he told AAP.
 "I think there will be a little celebration tonight. It is a relief. It should never have started in the first place but at least now it's sorted."
 Chan worked as a volunteer for a Christian charity His International Services (HIS), alongside director Jung Young-Kim from Korea, which contracted local company PHV Construction to build a school for 1,000 bilingual students.
 But the multi-million-dollar project was abandoned in 2016 after a dispute with the contractors turned nasty and the case was referred to the National Commercial Arbitration Centre, a civil court where Chan, his director and charity were cleared of any wrong doing.
 However, PHV launched criminal charges and he was arrested last year, charged with "criminal fraud" and spent three months behind bars, sharing a cell with 95 other inmates after bail was denied twice.
 He was bailed in a Phnom Penh appeals court last month and his case has won widespread support among Khmers.
 It is also being closely watched by NGOs, charities and business groups concerned with Cambodia's court system.
 An international petition demanding his release and calling on the Australian government to intervene garnered more than 12,000 names.
 However, Chan said he was still not allowed to leave Cambodia after a travel ban was imposed following his arrest. He said the paperwork to resolve this issue would take about a month to resolve.
 'At least now we can get on with it and start an a new chapter of our lives in Cambodia," he told AAP.
 Chan and his wife Deborah Kim studied optometry in New South Wales and have since established an optometrist shop in Phnom Penh.
 Chan always said he was optimistic of being acquitted and has been backed by the Supreme Consultation Forum (SCF) a body that can refer difficult legal cases to Prime Minister Hun Sen for mediation.

Research on COVID-19 may seem limited to strictly biology, but some Cornell demographers have shown that they can also contribute.
 To study how vulnerable New York counties are to COVID-19 outbreaks, demographers from the Cornell Population Center and the Cornell Program on Applied Demographics created an interactive mapping tool.
 The mapping application was designed to help officials analyze underlying risk factors that would worsen the spread of COVID-19 if it were to hit a certain county. The map also provides updated data on COVID-19 testing, the number of positive cases and deaths by county. County officials are now using the tool to help them respond to the unfolding pandemic, according to a University press release.
 This tool ranks each of New York’s 62 counties in terms of how susceptible they are to a localized outbreak, based on the risk factors of demographics and health. Counties are assigned index numbers, which indicates the level of risk in the county, compared to the average risk level.
 To measure demographic vulnerability, the risk factors considered were the percentage of the population 80 years of age or above, the percentage of people living in group quarters facilities, households that span three generations and the percent of the population with a disability.
 Health risks known to complicate COVID-19 were evaluated to measure health vulnerability — such as the percent of a county’s adult population that has asthma, cardiovascular disease, diabetes or high blood pressure, as well as the adult obesity and smoking rates.
 Index numbers were calculated using data on how prevalent certain risk factors are in a county’s population.
 Tompkins County ranks in the bottom-quartile on both measures, even though some surrounding counties had higher index numbers.
 Rural upstate New York, particularly in the Adirondack and Chautauqua- Allegheny regions, is still likely to be the most susceptible to a COVID-19 outbreak due to the prevalence of these risk factors. At peak transmission, an outbreak could overwhelm healthcare systems in the region.
 Based on demographics and health, Hamilton and Montgomery county — largely rural areas — are the most vulnerable to an outbreak.
 However, several counties that make up the New York City metropolitan area — including New York and Westchester counties — also rank in the bottom-quartile on both measures, even though the outbreak has been largely concentrated there.
 The residential and social density of the counties surrounding the metropolitan area contributed to its surge in cases, said Matt Hall, director of the CPC. The mapping tool’s developers did not factor in these aspects when they calculated the vulnerability indexes.
 Most of Tompkins County’s under-80 population has few pre-existing health conditions, with a low proportion living below the poverty line — these characteristics gave the county a low index number.
 While the health vulnerability and demographic vulnerability scores do not necessarily correlate, some counties do have high index numbers for both measures.
 According to Hall, the mapping tool does not predict where future outbreaks might occur.
 “This is a very early version of this project,” Hall said. “We’d like to incorporate information on hospital capacities and social and residential density.”
 Warren Brown, director of the PAD, said the mapping tool acts as a warning to places that have not yet experienced outbreaks.
 “It's not as if you're out of the woods and you're safe,” Brown said. “If the disease spreads there, then it could be more devastating than it has been even downstate.”

Having covered sports for 30 years as a Tribune sportswriter — retiring in 2002 — I can imagine the consternation that the current sports staff is suffering in wake of the coronavirus epidemic.
 The major league baseball season is about to be wiped out, although some say a short season in Arizona involving all 30 MLB teams is a possible way out. I just don’t see that happening.
 So, without live action, we’re stuck with memories of great teams and individual heroics, thanks to television and the internet.
 Who could ever forget a crippled Kirk Gibson going deep on A’s superb reliever Dennis Eckersley to give the Dodgers a dramatic ninth inning victory over Oakland in the 1988 World Series opener?
 Or who could ever forget Toronto’s Joe Carter’s walk-off homer that ended the 1993 fall classic in six games.
 Or who could ever forget Bobby Thompson’s game-winning homer in the bottom of the ninth in the 1951 National League championship playoff game?
 I was a high school sophomore when I cheered that shot heard around the world on my small transistor radio I had snuck into class.
 So recently I got to thinking. What was my big moment when something dramatic happened in my life? To my surprise, it had nothing to do with sports but instead it had to do with a Hollywood movie star.
 It all came to me after I watched a 1936 movie entitled “Follow the Fleet” that starred actress Betty Grable and highlighted her dancing skills.
 Grable, whose sexy pinup photo was on many soldiers’ locker room doors during World War II, became one of the richest and most famous and sought-after actresses of the 1930s, ‘40s and ‘50s.
 And in that 1936 movie, she and the great Fred Astaire brought the house down with their stirring and memorable fast-paced dance performance helped along by a song entitled “Let Yourself Go.”
 Why, you might ask, would I ever pick an 84-year-old film starring a blond bombshell of her day to be the big dramatic moment in my life?
 Of course, that wasn’t it, but what I’ve said up to now helps set the scene for pinpointing my big moment, and that actually came on April 21, 1968, in Las Vegas.
 On that evening, the Stardust Country Club hosted a cocktail party to officially close out the 16th annual Tournament of Champions golf event. And who do you think was serving as guest host for the event? None other than Betty Grable, the very same starlet who 32 years prior to that day in Vegas had hit the dance floor in the arms of Fred Astaire.
 Now, suddenly in Sin City, she would again be on the dance floor but in someone else’s arms.
 Mine. That’s right. Mine.
 You see, she had volunteered to dance with any of the sports writers who had covered the tournament, and I jumped at the opportunity. And for about 15 to 20 seconds before another writer cut in, I was in my own world of dreams as I put my arms around her and in my mind pretended to be Fred Astaire. But all I could say to a still beautiful lady was nothing. (Grable sadly died at the age of 56 in 1973.)
 But even though I was tongue-tied, dancing with the star was indeed my biggest and most memorable moment.
 I think there are many of us who find their greatest enjoyment in hobnobbing with famous people, even if for only a few moments.
 Serving as sports editor of the Kent (Wash.) News Journal in 1969, I and my photographer Derek Oliver covered an Oakland A’s at Seattle Pilots American League game at Sick Stadium.
 After the A’s had prevailed, the two of us went to the hospitality room where we ran into A’s coach and Hall of Famer Joe DiMaggio, who still to this day holds the record for hitting in 56 straight games. Believe it or not, the three of us proceeded to talk about soccer for nearly an hour, and in all that time I never thought about having a photo taken of Joltin’ Joe with me and one with Oliver.
 And there have been those moments when I didn’t have time to take a picture, let alone say anything to someone famous.
 A good example took place in a 1962 exhibition game in Palm Springs, Calif., between the Los Angeles Dodgers and the Los Angeles Angels. Right after the Angels prevailed in the first-ever meeting of the two L.A teams, I was walking to my car when I suddenly realized that Dwight Eisenhower, former president of the United States, and his wife Mamie were just steps behind me. I managed to turn around and was allowed to shake his hand but, like my dance with Grable, I didn’t say a word.
 And then there was the Oakland A’s first-ever home game against Baltimore in April 1968 when I found myself in the crowded Coliseum elevator standing right next to Ronald Reagan, then governor of California and eventually a two-term U.S. president. Again I had nothing to say to the Gipper.
 Hopefully, I shall not remain speechless in Lewiston.

Plan A, Plan B, Plan C, Plan D.      That's the mantra of Boston Marathon Race Director Dave McGillivray. Having already faced nearly every possible crisis in the event management business, Dave knows you need to have a back-up plan to your back-up plan in order to have something lined up for nearly every contingency. Yes, nearly every contingency.      Welcome to 2020's version of "never saw that coming!" and that's the coronavirus pandemic. But imaginable or not, it was the responsibility of Dave and the folks at the BAA to wrestle with a solution to this crisis that would be fair, safe and realistic. The current plan calls for "Boston in the Fall," which will be held on Sept. 14. The 124th edition was supposed to be held on April 20.      But the Boston Marathon wasn't the only event struggling with this crisis. The first to cancel was the Tokyo Marathon; then the Great Wall Marathon; Rome cancelled; London postponed to Oct. 4; Flying Pig postponed to Oct. 11; Paris postponed to Oct. 18; and Barcelona postponed to Oct. 25. By St. Patrick's Day virtually every local race was cancelled or was postponed as the "Stay at Home" advisories were issued, and now even the venerable Summer Olympics will be postponed for a year.      So, runners, just like Dave McGillivray, also had to develop a plan A, B, C and D.      For those planning to run a spring marathon, weeks of intensive training were already in the books, but the likelihood there will be a replacement event in the near future appears to be slim. Ongoing training is compromised with the closure of gyms and the social distancing limitations of coached workouts.      Realizing the full impact upon training regimens has led most runners to go through the five stages of "runner's grief."      First is denial. When the suggestion was made that there was a possibility of cancelling Boston and other running events, Facebook was filled with disbelief that this could even be considered, because after all isn't running a healthy activity?      Then, there's anger. The question was raised by many, on how dare race directors consider eliminating events after they put in months of preparation.      Bargaining and depression came next. The ban on these events must be for only international level events, right? Let's find a more local spring marathon. Surely, the Vermont City Marathon, for example, will be fine. Depressingly, all options began to disappear.      Here we are now at the acceptance stage, and with acceptance has come a realization of how fortunate runners are to have an outlet to help alleviate the stress of this crisis. Perhaps large group runs are off limits, but I see scores and scores of runners and walkers throughout the day either running alone or in small groups that are six-feet apart to adapt to the new norms that were created to slow down the spread of this virus.      As a fellow runner, I have found one of the blessings this current circumstance has gifted us is the opportunity to change the focus of our runs. Training is taking a backseat to mindful running.      For the time being, race pace is irrelevant. Weekly mileage is not critical. Now is a great time to fully immerse into the joys of running by opening up all our senses. Rather than concentrating on our smart watches that remind us how far, how fast and how many steps we've earned, we can now enjoy the sights, smells and sounds of spring.      My runs during these past few weeks have been a joy, as I explore new routes, while seeing so many folks who now have the time to go for a walk with spouses and children, and not worry about how fast they got it done.      This crisis we now face will end at some point. In the meantime, however, we have been granted a unique opportunity to de-stress, get outdoors and enjoy whatever the weather delivers, while recognizing the gift that a healthy lifestyle can give.   So, whether you are a finely tuned competitive runner, a modest racer, a novice jogger or a walker, get outside and enjoy this opportunity of guilt- free pleasure.   Stay well and wash your hands!

The notorious, armor-clad, 19th-century Australian bushranger (slang for rural outlaw) Ned Kelly had previously been portrayed onscreen by Mick Jagger ("Ned Kelly," 1970) and by Heath Ledger ("Ned Kelly," 2003). Neither of those films was particularly memorable. Now, here comes British rising star George MacKay, the long-faced lead actor in "1917," to sparklingly bring the character to life in what turns out to be the best, by far, of the three attempts to tell the story.      But let's start with an important point: The beautiful and occasionally brutal film, from Australian director Justin Kurzel, bearing the much longer title "True History of the Kelly Gang," is not a "true history." Based on the Booker Prize-winning 2000 novel by Peter Carey, it, like the book, is a dramatic mix of fact and fiction that tells a fanciful version of the short life of Kelly from the age of 12 (terrifically played by Australian newcomer Orlando Schwerdt) to his final date with destiny 13 years later.      I won't attempt to speculate what's true here and what isn't, because since the film is making no claims to it, it doesn't make any difference. Besides, what's up on the screen is both riveting and entertaining.      Young Ned is first met growing up in a tin shack in a rural town north of Melbourne, the oldest of his siblings, with his mum, Ellen (Essie Davis), and dad, Red, all of them just eking by. Red (Ben Corbett) was a no-count loser who didn't provide for his family. Ellen, much to Red's consternation, earned money by selling her body to various male visitors, including the strapping but dastardly Sgt. O'Neil (Charlie Hunnam).      After Red is removed from the story, Ellen, hoping to give Ned something of a future, works out a deal with an old friend, the smiling, rough and tumble scoundrel Harry Power (Russell Crowe in an extended, scene-stealing cameo), who takes the lad out on the road to teach him the ways of the world, which include keeping a journal "to write your own history" and how to kill people.      Every performance in the film's first 40 minutes is right on the mark (Crowe even gets to sing!). But it's at that point, 10 years later in the story, that MacKay appears, bent backward, his head disconcertingly upside down, his adult Ned Kelly preparing for a bare-knuckle barroom fight, just before heading back home to his mum and grown siblings with hopes of becoming a farmer.      But that hope doesn't materialize, and we know that part is true, that Ned will end up embracing a life of crime, due to a variety of reasons, people and circumstances. It's then that the film starts introducing many more characters. Of note are George King (the amazing Marlon Williams), the much- younger man - and cad - who is about to marry Ned's unbalanced mum, and who is training Ned's brothers to become thieves; the charming but heinous Constable Fitzpatrick (Nicholas Hoult), whose behavior eventually goes unhinged; and Mary Hearn (Thomasin McKenzie), a sweet young woman working at a local brothel.      It would be simplest to say that this is an Australian art house Western, but it's chock full of cinematic and storytelling ingredients that pull it up above that category. It's about bad things happening to good people, and the revenge being sought because it of; it gets into people who are so driven by their goals, they start losing their marbles; and it offers explanations of why the bushrangers who became known as the Kelly Gang started donning dresses and armor before going into action.      One outstanding visual highlight of the film occurs near the end, when the law is closing in on the gang, and the screen erupts in an eerie and bizarrely and beautifully photographed nighttime gunfight. But even that long sequence can't hold a candle to the bigger-than-life, make that gigantic, performance by George MacKay. He's been at his craft for quite a while, and he's now, finally, a star in the making.      "True History of the Kelly Gang" will be available on most digital and cable platforms beginning April 24.      Ed Symkus can be reached at esymkus@rcn.com.

"I would think they would be the hottest commodity in the business right now," Anderson said. "I think everybody is going to vying for them, whoever ends up eventually getting them will be a much better company for it. They are the most unselfish, giving guys I have seen in a long long time and they have that same mentality that Tully and I and the original Horsemen had. That was go out and steal the show and make everybody in that arena blow themselves up either cheering or booing during that match. I think these guys have the talent and the ability that wherever they land, they're going to be a very lucky company."
 "I am very very honored that they took some of our stuff and put their own twist on it, some cases made it better. If anyone looks at them and goes 'God, they're working like the Brainbusters' then I am honored that somebody looks at it that way."
 Anderson was also asked if he and his former Brainbusters tag team partner, Tully Blanchard, have ever had a conversation about The Revival.
 "Not really," Anderson said. "Before coming to work with AEW, Tully had been really off the radar for a long long time, I doubt he had watched very many shows on television. I bet you he is not plugged into those guys, it wouldn't take him long to get plugged into them. Obviously just food for thought the way things happen, if Tully is looking for a partner for Shawn Spears, what a couple of partners those guys would make. Just food for thought."
