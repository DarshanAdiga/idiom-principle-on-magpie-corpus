With Apple's announcement of iOS 14 at its annual WWDC developers conference on June 22, we now know more about what the upcoming iPhone, and all the other iPhones that are compatible with the update, can do. From widgets and app libraries to picture-in-picture, you can expect a bunch of software as well as hardware upgrades to the iPhone 12, 12 Pro and 12 Max. (Apple has not confirmed the names of the phones, but we'll go with those for now.)


  So far, it looks like the new iPhones are on schedule for the fall, but when exactly will it launch during the season is still up in the air. Though we usually see new flagship iPhones in September, recent reports say that Apple may delay the iPhone 11 sequels due to thecoronavirus pandemic. This is understandable with the iPhone 12 sailing into unknown water. The COVID-19 outbreak forced Apple to close its US retail stores indefinitely and all its stores outside China. Suppliers in China have also shut down or are operating on limited capacity, which may impact not only inventory in September but sales, too.

MASKING THE PROBLEM
 I understand that most people living in democracies regard individual freedom as a right.  But after seeing what is going on in the southern U.S., with regard to COVID-19, I am inclined to think that the government has a primary role to play in regulating some of those freedoms. Republicans, in particular, are inclined to place a huge emphasis on small government, and less interference on people's lives.  Unfortunately, the citizens of Arizona, Texas, Florida, and the Democratic states of Nevada and California are living proof that many individuals cannot be trusted to do the right things when it comes to COVID-19.  Furthermore, Republican President Donald Trump is pushing to reduce the amount of COVID-19 testing because it "makes the U.S. look bad" when compared with other nations.

  But the controversial Good Morning Britain host has even managed to upset someone quite close to home, after he and fellow ITV stalwart Denise Welch clashed over a number of his strong views.


  Denise says that Piers has even blocked her on Twitter following a series of arguments on topics from mental health to coronavirus.

  Piers had made the claim after Denise hit out at his attitude to mental health - saying that children need to "toughen up a bit."

Over the past three weeks, Lafayette County has seen large increases in positive COVID-19 cases. This is not completely surprising. It went without saying that as students returned and businesses reopened that positive cases would increase. We have, however, been surprised at the rate of transmission over the past month and subsequent increase in positive tests.


  The City of Oxford Board of Aldermen has relied on advice from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), Mississippi Department of Health (MsDH) Officials, consultation from local healthcare providers and data to make decisions regarding how to govern during this pandemic. Timely data has become harder to come by. Oxford and other college towns in Mississippi have unique reporting issues.


  The MsDH assigns a positive COVID-19 case to the county a person lists as his primary residence. This means that a student from Atlanta attending the University of Mississippi that tests positive at a clinic in Oxford is reported as a positive case in Fulton County, Georgia – not Lafayette County. We knew each day as we looked at our case increases that there were probably a handful more than reported.


  I was contacted by two local urgent care clinics concerned about the huge increase in positive cases they had recently seen among college age individuals – most of whom were from outside of Lafayette County. This meant that these positive cases were not credited to Lafayette County through the MsDH. Obviously if these two clinics had seen such an increase in positive cases then there were many more cases in Lafayette County that we did not know about.


  I contacted two additional clinics and learned that among the four clinics we had at least 162 positive COVID-19 results attributed to people reporting primary residences outside of Lafayette County between June 1-14. These clinics reported that most of the positive individuals reported being at large gatherings. This is a huge concern for leadership of college towns, and we have addressed these concerns with the MsDH over the past few weeks. The best we can determine it is taking approximately 10 days for someone that tests positive for COVID-19 to be counted in MsDH’s daily reports. MsDH is working with outdated software and is woefully understaffed. This week the City of Oxford began requesting reporting from the 14 testing sites in in our community to be sent directly to Oxford’s Emergency Management Department. We believe this data is critical as we determine a path forward for our community, and I want to publicly thank those healthcare providers for working with the City of Oxford to provide this information.


  Experts had warned that there would be a second spike in the fall. In the spring, experts speculated that cases were expected to dissipate in the summer. This makes this summer spike even more concerning.


  The City of Oxford has had a Serving Oxford Safely Plan in place since March. We believe we have a plan that affords us the best opportunity to continue to have our businesses open without overwhelming our healthcare system. We have learned quickly that even the best plan on paper is only a good intention unless it is taken seriously and followed by our residents. Gathering data from these clinics and requiring residents to wear face coverings will be critical to our future success. People are experiencing frustration and fatigue from this ongoing pandemic and are not being as diligent about following the requirements.


  Dr. Fauci stated this week, “A risk for you is not just isolated to you. Because if you get infected, you are a part – innocently or inadvertently – of propagating the dynamic process of a pandemic.”


  The overwhelming majority of individuals testing positive in Oxford recently are young adults. These young adults get infected, and infect someone else – who infects someone else who ultimately infects someone who is vulnerable. Think about your grandparents, your neighbor with diabetes, the person going through chemotherapy. Dr. Fauci summed it up perfectly, “You have an individual responsibility to yourself but you have a societal responsibility.”


  When I wear a face covering, it is not because I am fearful. It is because I want to be part of the solution, not the problem. We are all in it together and the only way we are going to end it, is by ending it together.

Kenya: Shikanda - Watch This Space, We Will Soon End Our Long Wait for the Kpl Title

"  


  Something smells rotten in Lower Makefield, but it's not the sewer system. On Wednesday our board of supervisors will vote on the sale of our sewer system assets to the highest bidder, without rigorous consideration of other options which would capture a broader selection of bids. One such option: form a joint authority comprised of LMT and surrounding municipalities that will experience profound effects if LMT sells its sewer assets. Those municipalities are clamoring for a meeting before LMT makes an irreversible decision Wednesday.


  This is literally the largest financial transaction in LMT's lifetime and it will remain the largest for generations to come. We cannot afford to rush this through -- the stakes are too high. And yet, this topic of utmost importance is scheduled for a regular board session instead of a special session. The hubris is stunning.


  The list of problems with the board's bidding approach is too long to list here, but anybody can smell the swamp stench arising out of this secretive bidding process. Despite my repeated efforts for the board to make the process transparent, it didn't even share draft bid documents with our own sewer authority or our own sewer subcommittee. Furthermore, the sewer engineer submitted a thick report about sewage treatment options to the sewer subcommittee in October, but that was only released by the township manager to the board members after this week's board meeting. That, folks, is obfuscation in its purest form. Can it get any smellier in LMT?


  Why not perform this work in the light? I believe all odors emanate from a majority of the board that just wants to sell the assets for big bucks and be over with it. Damn the torpedoes. Full speed ahead.


  The timing of this asset sale is irresponsible because our township hasn't truly begun to sort out a solution to our expensive wastewater treatment problems; better bids would likely be forthcoming after mitigating that risk of uncertainty.


  The problem here is that the board doesn't have the knowledge required to know if their financial consulting firm is providing them with a truly holistic view of all options. That consultant is not a wastewater engineering firm, so they too don't know what they don't know. That firm is being paid based on a percentage of any deal the board closes; pungent indeed.


  I'm not saying that anything illegal has occurred -- I'm not an attorney. However, the board has been less than transparent, purposefully keeping details of their progress toward an outright sale away from the cleansing sunlight. In fact, the board voted 3-2 in executive session to not consider a third bidder's offer to purchase, thus that bid was not discussed at last week's public meeting -- truly rotten. That meeting ran until midnight on a workday, leaving only four members of the public to weigh-in during public comment. Equally foul-smelling is that the board did not reveal to the public that all along it was seeking to sell our sewer system outright, which explains why it didn't seriously consider other options despite my attempts over the course of several months to encourage them to cast a wider net.


  This process stinks to high heaven. The only way we're going to clear away this stench is for you to get involved today. Immediately contact Supervisor James McCartney because I believe he is the swing vote we need to delay this decision and allow for a transparent process of critical review by our sewer authority, sewer subcommittee, and indeed our own supervisors. He can be reached at jmccartney@lmt.org and his phone number as listed on LMT.org is (267) 274-1147.


  Please participate in Wednesday night's board of supervisors meeting which will be held online using Zoom. See www.LMT.org for meeting details that will be posted soon.

On the health front, the Band offers step- and sleep-tracking and 24/7 heart- rate monitoring, although I have concerns about the accuracy of all three features. As with a lot of inexpensive trackers, steps often get counted even if you're just sitting at your desk, occasionally gesturing with your hand. My measured sleep times were roughly in line with what I see from my Withings Sleep Pad, but the ratios of light/deep sleep within those hours were vastly different. (Wyze provides no actionable info based on your sleep patterns, either.)


  As for heart rate, my readings seemed to vary widely, especially in comparison with what I know to be my average heart rate. It may be that I wasn't wearing it in the right spot on my wrist, or it may be that a $25 watch isn't the most reliable source of HR numbers.

Star Wars Legion board game on sale now

Something smells rotten in Lower Makefield, but it's not the sewer system. On Wednesday our board of supervisors will vote on the sale of our sewer system assets to the highest bidder, without rigorous consideration of other options which would capture a broader selection of bids. One such option: form a joint authority comprised of LMT and surrounding municipalities that will experience profound effects if LMT sells its sewer assets. Those municipalities are clamoring for a meeting before LMT makes an irreversible decision Wednesday.


   


  This is literally the largest financial transaction in LMT's lifetime and it will remain the largest for generations to come. We cannot afford to rush this through -- the stakes are too high. And yet, this topic of utmost importance is scheduled for a regular board session instead of a special session. The hubris is stunning.


   


  The list of problems with the board's bidding approach is too long to list here, but anybody can smell the swamp stench arising out of this secretive bidding process. Despite my repeated efforts for the board to make the process transparent, it didn't even share draft bid documents with our own sewer authority or our own sewer subcommittee. Furthermore, the sewer engineer submitted a thick report about sewage treatment options to the sewer subcommittee in October, but that was only released by the township manager to the board members after this week's board meeting. That, folks, is obfuscation in its purest form. Can it get any smellier in LMT?


   


  Why not perform this work in the light? I believe all odors emanate from a majority of the board that just wants to sell the assets for big bucks and be over with it. Damn the torpedoes. Full speed ahead.


   


  The timing of this asset sale is irresponsible because our township hasn't truly begun to sort out a solution to our expensive wastewater treatment problems; better bids would likely be forthcoming after mitigating that risk of uncertainty.


   


  The problem here is that the board doesn't have the knowledge required to know if their financial consulting firm is providing them with a truly holistic view of all options. That consultant is not a wastewater engineering firm, so they too don't know what they don't know. That firm is being paid based on a percentage of any deal the board closes; pungent indeed.


   


  I'm not saying that anything illegal has occurred -- I'm not an attorney. However, the board has been less than transparent, purposefully keeping details of their progress toward an outright sale away from the cleansing sunlight. In fact, the board voted 3-2 in executive session to not consider a third bidder's offer to purchase, thus that bid was not discussed at last week's public meeting -- truly rotten. That meeting ran until midnight on a workday, leaving only four members of the public to weigh-in during public comment. Equally foul-smelling is that the board did not reveal to the public that all along it was seeking to sell our sewer system outright, which explains why it didn't seriously consider other options despite my attempts over the course of several months to encourage them to cast a wider net.


   


  This process stinks to high heaven. The only way we're going to clear away this stench is for you to get involved today. Immediately contact Supervisor James McCartney because I believe he is the swing vote we need to delay this decision and allow for a transparent process of critical review by our sewer authority, sewer subcommittee, and indeed our own supervisors. He can be reached at jmccartney@lmt.org and his phone number as listed on LMT.org is (267) 274-1147.


   


  Please participate in Wednesday night's board of supervisors meeting which will be held online using Zoom. See www.LMT.org for meeting details that will be posted soon.

"What we need is a compromise where we assist short term survival for small firms while not creating zombie firms," that survive on cheap credit alone, Bernanke said. "It is not clear that the Main Street program ... is going to be enough."


  LITTLE UPTAKE


  So far none of the programs set up to backstop companies and markets outside the financial sector have seen much use. By contrast more traditional programs to ensure financial institutions keep doing business in a crisis have been more extensive and by most accounts successful.


  Since late February the central bank has increased its overall balance sheet - a measure of its footprint in the economy - from US$4.2 trillion to US$7.1 trillion.


  Most of that stemmed from keeping the government bond and mortgage-backed securities markets on track: holdings of U.S. Treasuries and MBS increased around US$2.4 trillion. Foreign central banks swapping their currencies for dollars accounted for another roughly US$230 billion.


  What distinguished the response to this crisis from the 2007 to 2009 financial meltdown was the offer to lend directly to private firms and local governments. Announced with fanfare in early April, the Fed said it would, among other steps, provide around US$2 trillion to buy bonds to finance large corporations; lend directly to small and medium sized businesses; and help state and local governments raise funds to meet expenses.


  Weeks later those programs are up and running - the Fed on Monday launched its latest effort to purchase new corporate bond issues - but of the US$1.85 trillion notionally available only about US$9.5 billion has been tapped.


  The Fed of course can't make people apply for loans, and the credit costs and other measures that might trigger more aggressive purchases of corporate bonds, for example, have improved since the early days of the pandemic.


  Powell in prepared remarks for Tuesday's hearing said Main Street lending may prove valuable "in the months ahead" for firms hit by the dramatic drop in economic activity during the pandemic.


  Still, analysts are cutting estimates of how large the Fed's balance sheet might grow during a crisis some thought might test its capacities.


  The CARES Act raised the possibility of US$4.5 trillion in credit flowing from the central bank. The total may end up less than a fourth of that.


  "The usage of the Fed credit facilities has been much slower and smaller than we had anticipated," Oxford Economics analyst Kathy Bostjancic wrote last week, estimating perhaps only half of the Main Street loans available will be taken and perhaps less than a third of the corporate bond fund be used.

While there is no known cure or vaccine to treat Covid-19, ‚remdesivir‘, a drug originally developed to treat Ebola, is now set to be used for treating patients in the EU, after receiving the green light from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) on Thursday (25 June). The experts advised remdesivir to be used for patients over the age of 12 who require oxygen supplements. The European Commission is still required to approve the drug, marketed as Veklury, but this is usually viewed as a formality. Regulators in Japan and the US have already signed off on its use. Meanwhile, EU officials are debating who will be allowed and who will be banned to enter the EU on 1 July when the bloc's international borders are scheduled to be opened. The list has already stirred controversy after news leaked that the United States, as the worst-affected country worldwide by Covid-19, is on the ‚banned list‘.

Face aux mesures de reconfinement prises à Lisbonne où est prévu en août le tournoi final de la Ligue des champions, l'UEFA a indiqué mardi qu'il n'y a "aucune raison de prévoir un plan B".      "Nous espérons que tout ira bien et qu'il sera possible d'organiser le tournoi au Portugal. Pour le moment, il n'y a aucune raison de prévoir un plan B", a indiqué à l'AFP un porte-parole de l'UEFA, précisant que l'instance du football européen est "en contacts permanents avec la Fédération portugaise de football et les autorités locales".      "Nous suivons la situation au quotidien et nous nous adapterons le moment venu si nécessaire", a-t-il encore indiqué, reprenant les mots prononcés le 17 juin par le président de l'UEFA, Aleksander Ceferin.      A compter de mercredi, les habitants de 19 quartiers de la banlieue nord de Lisbonne où persistent des foyers de contagion au coronavirus seront de nouveau confinés à domicile, a annoncé le Premier ministre Antonio Costa.      Dans ces sous-communes contigües mais réparties sur cinq municipalités, dont celle de Lisbonne même, les rassemblements seront limités à cinq personnes, contre 10 personnes dans l'ensemble de la région de la capitale et 20 dans le reste du Portugal.      La finale de la Ligue des champions 2019-2020, compétition suspendue mi-mars à cause du coronavirus, doit avoir lieu dimanche 23 août à Lisbonne, à l'issue d'un tournoi final inédit réunissant huit équipes dans la capitale portugaise à partir du 12 août.      Quatre équipes sont déjà qualifiées pour les quarts de finale de C1: le Paris SG, le RB Leipzig, l'Atalanta Bergame et l'Atlético Madrid.      Les quatre autres tickets seront attribués après les huitièmes de finale retour restant à disputer et prévus les 7 et 8 août dans des lieux encore à déterminer, soit sur le terrain de l'équipe qui reçoit, soit au Portugal.      La présence ou non de spectateurs dans ce tournoi sera "régulièrement évaluée" en fonction de la situation sanitaire, avait indiqué l'UEFA le 17 juin.      Au Portugal, pays d'environ 10 millions d'habitants, où le masque est obligatoire dans les espaces fermés, le nombre de nouveaux cas quotidiens est remonté ces derniers jours à entre 300 et 400, alors qu'il était tombé à environ une centaine début mai.

When the USSR collapsed America found itself as a hegemony, the most powerful nation on Earth. A major factor was our space program. Discovery was at its end. It flew on the back of a 747, circling D.C. on its way to a museum. The Constellation rocket-capsule program to take humans into orbit and then to the moon was canceled in 2010. Space was ceded to Russia and China. Russia took money and charged 56 million including return to carry an astronaut. China took a different path and announced it would go to the moon by 2025. A significant symbol of overtaking America.

“It is based on common sense, not ideology."
 That's a line taken from the Kenney government's Alberta Recovery Plan released Monday. It is meant as justification for the largest infrastructure program in Alberta history - coming from what was supposed to be the province's most conservative government in a quarter century.
 At least they got the second half right. The recovery plan is "not ideology."
 This marks a 40 per cent increase in capital (infrastructure) spending, beyond what was contained in this year's provincial budget.
 In all, about $10 billion will be earmarked for "roads, bridges, overpasses, water projects, pipelines, gas lines, schools, hospitals, long-term care homes for seniors, drug treatment centres, tourism infrastructure, and much more."
 I can see the attractiveness of rushing these projects ahead to create jobs for some of the tens of thousands of Albertans who are out of work. And as long as the bulk of the money is going into hard, tangible assets, it might achieve some of the good the government is predicting - such as 50,000 jobs.
 Governments can induce private-sector productivity gains by, for instance, improving transportation that helps raw materials get to manufacturers and goods get to markets.
 Newer schools can help better train grade-school and post-secondary students for better futures. But that's more indirect. And somewhat coincidental.
 More teachers and better curriculums are more important than shiny, new school buildings.
 And if we're going to have to deal with pandemics in the future, more hospitals and better facilities for vulnerable seniors are probably justifiable.
 But this is a huge chunk of money for a government that is already unable to make ends meet. The UCP can borrow that now, but at some point tax dollars have to be found to pay it off.
 And if the taxes don't come in from recovered oil prices, then ordinary working taxpayers will be left to pick up the bill.
 Frankly, if you'd been lost in space without communications for the last two years and just returned to Earth on Monday, you could be forgiven for thinking at first glance that the NDP were still in charge in Alberta.
 That's how free-spending the UCP plan is.
 The UCP recovery plan is not as flagrant or frivolous as an NDP plan likely would have been.
 You can bet an NDP scheme would have been stuffed to the gills with green projects. A wind turbine in every yard and a solar panel on every roof!
 Every UCP initiative, on the other hand, is designed not just to get construction workers, road builders and concrete pourers back to work – now – but also “spur the creation of thousands of other jobs for sub-contractors, suppliers, small businesses, hotels, and restaurants in every corner of the province.”
 This is bedrock stuff, not airy-fairy theory. It is government aiding the private sector, not taking over private decision making.
 And it’s not just resource focused. It bolsters the ag sector, tourism, finance and high tech, too.
 It’s not all hammer and nails, either. There is even a cultural relaunch program “to support music, performing arts and landmark cultural events which have been especially hard-hit by public health measures.”
 The council in charge of the program is comprised of some of Alberta’s best thinkers and business minds, including Jack Mintz, perhaps the finest public policy economist in the country; Clive Beddoe, the founder of WestJet; Nancy Southern, who heads up ATCO, and former prime minister Stephen Harper, among others.
 None of this will get rid of the Trudeau government, though, whose anti-oil policies remain the biggest impediment to Alberta’s recovery.
 And make no mistake, this is a LOT of money.
 But, on balance, there probably aren’t many alternatives.

Taking up fishing as a serious pastime wasn’t a tough sell, said Kriewald, 19, the sisters’ cousin.


  “We’re always kind of down for anything with us three, so it didn’t take much,” Kriewald said. “I don’t really know the names of anywhere we’ve gone, but we just kind of find a spot on the map that we think might be good and then we try it out.”


  Fish Sticks is the name of the group chat they formed to talk fishing and make plans, Megan Peck said.


  “I just came up with the name ‘Fish Sticks’ because we just do it for fun, basically,” she said. “It’s kind of funny.”

The thing is, that's where we wanted we to go all along. To get there, Jeffrey Patty and I descended off trail from Klamath National Forest, plunging down into the canyon to the headwaters of Blue Creek.

"My goal is to bring the change that people always promise to bring but once they get there they don't bring it. At the end of the day it's all about standing grounds on what you believe in. Myself and a brother of mine, Steve, we started upgrading homes in Kibra way before. That on its own was just me playing my role as Kenyan in Kenya," he said.

The Times trio even threw in a bit of casual xenophobia. “I think we had forgotten how organically ruthless the Russians could be,” they quoted Peter Zwack, a retired military intelligence officer, as saying. Imagine a report saying Asians, Africans, Mexicans or Jews are “organically ruthless.” That's right, you can't, because it wouldn't happen. But Russians, being predominantly white and Christian, are considered to be fair game.

Crazy Mike insists that I should have "one (column) in the can" for the week that the apocalypse comes and I'm about to miss my deadline. Trouble is that it's our 15th week of Armageddon in a row and as yet I haven't missed a cutoff. I'm not the Cal Ripken of journalism, but I'm consistent. Herb Caen famously wrote 14,133,000 words for The Chronicle over 58 years. My husband, Brian, has lesser aspirations for me, in that he sees me as the Hedda Hopper of The Chronicle.

"Look at Cameron Green - Painey was talking about him last week and his rise and dominance he's had in state cricket in the past 12 months in particular. He's such a young guy and I think that potential is huge," he added.


  Wicket-keeper batsman Josh Phillipe has made a huge impact in the Big Bash League (BBL) for the Sydney Sixers and he was the Player of the Match in the final of the tournament earlier this year.


  On the other hand, the 23-year-old Richardson has already announced himself on the international stage and will be looking to return to action after having undergone another round of surgery on his right shoulder.


  "Then you've got young batters, Josh Philippe and these guys. I think what's really important about them and Josh, in particular, is he dominated a Big Bash final," Finch said.


  "But then you've got other guys who I can't wait to see back up and fire. Jhye Richardson; he's as exciting a young fast bowler as there is going around when he's firing. Having his shoulder redone again I think will be a good thing for him in the long run. It probably doesn't feel like it when he's going through his rehab again," he added.


  Finch was last seen in action during the first ODI against New Zealand in March this year. After the first ODI, the rest of the two matches were postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic.


  All international cricket has been suspended since March this year due to the coronavirus pandemic, however, the series between England and West Indies will mark the return of international cricket.

There are a lot of things one wonders about ancient civilizations. One of the most important of the civilizations was the Mesopotamian settlement tucked in between the rivers Tigris and Euphrates located in modern day Iraq and some parts of Kuwait, Iran, Turkey, and Syria. The ways of life of this long-lost human settlement was vastly different from the modern era. Now, netizens are lucky to have a small glimpse of that ancient Mesopotamian cuisine thanks to Cambridge University professor Bill Sutherland.


  Posted on Twitter, Sutherland shared a Twitter thread about six dishes he made from scratch using the recipes from a tablet from ancient Mesopotamia which dates back to 1750 BCE. Sutherland shared images of all the prepared dishes along with their recipes. Also, he detailed how each dish taste. If you're a history buff and a foodie, chances are this is a content which will make you very happy.


  The thread starts with two pictures. One of them shows the recipe tablet and the other picture shows the complete set of prepared dishes.


  "I blame lockdown but for some reason decided to cook Babylonian meal from the recipe tablet on the right; at 1750 BCE are the oldest recipes existing. Seemed to go down OK 'Best Mesopotamian meal I have eaten'", reads the caption.


   


   


  The thread goes on to describe ancient recipes like lamb stew, Tuh'u (a beet dish), sourdough bread and Elamite Broth.


  Posted on June 28, the post has garnered over 51,000 likes and tons of comments from netizens. While some were surprised and eager to make the same recipes, others were in awe. Many joked about the fact that one of the main ingredients used in Mesopotamian cuisine was fat.

The most obvious candidates to step in to fill a potential gap are established This Morning hosts Eamonn and Ruth.


  Ruth is the longest-serving This Morning presenter of all time, having started as a guest host way back in 1999.


  The married couple are the perfect presenting duo - bringing warmth and humour to our screens ever Friday since becoming main presenters in 2006.


  They also cover Phillip and Holly during school holiday weeks and during the summer holidays, so already know the ropes.


  But what This Morning viewers love most is the couple aren't afraid to confront each other live on air and have had their fair share of on-screen clashes over the years.
