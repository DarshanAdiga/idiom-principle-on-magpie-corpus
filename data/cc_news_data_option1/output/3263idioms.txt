The world has endured over six months of the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Older adults are at disproportionate risk of severe infection and mortality. They are also vulnerable to loneliness and social exclusion during the pandemic. Age and ageism both can act as significant risk factors during this pandemic, increasing the physical as well as psychosocial burden on the elderly. A review was performed in relation to the psychosocial vulnerabilities of the older adults during the pandemic, with insights from the similar biological disasters in the past. Besides the physiological risk, morbidities, polypharmacy and increased case fatality rates, various social factors like lack of security, loneliness, isolation, ageism, sexism, dependency, stigma, abuse and restriction to health care access were identified as crucial in pandemic situation. Frailty, cognitive and sensory impairments added to the burden. Marginalization and human rights deprivation emerged as a common pathway of suffering for the elderly during COVID-19. The implications of the emergent themes are discussed in light of psychosocial wellbeing and impact on the quality of life. The authors suggest potential recommendations to mitigate this marginalization on lines of the World Health Organization (WHO)'s concept of Healthy Ageing and the United Nations (U.N.) Sustainable Development Goals.

TALAMONE – Sono partiti da Cala delle Cannelle, poco dopo Cala di Forno, con l’idea di arrivare a nuoto a Talamone, nel comune di Orbetello. Hanno però evidentemente sottovalutato il percorso da fare (si tratta di 4-5 miglia nautiche), tanto che si sono dovuti fermare per chiedere aiuto.


  La coppia, un uomo e una donna, ha tentato la traversata, ma la donna ha incontrato difficoltà nella traversata, forse a causa delle condizioni meteo marine. Sono riusciti a raggiungere la terra ferma ed essendo in possesso di telefono cellulare e abiti probabilmente contenuti in sacche stagne adatte al traino a nuoto, hanno avvertito la sala operativa dei Vigili del fuoco indicando la loro posizione così da poter essere recuperati.


  Il 115 ha avvertito la Guardia costiera e si è alzato in volo l’elicottero del nucleo di Arezzo dei Vigili del fuoco. L’elicottero, visto il luogo impervio in cui i due si trovavano, ha issato a bordo la coppia con il verricello e si sta portando in zona sicura per l’atterraggio, dove la squadra dei Vigili a terra preleverà i due dopo i controlli sanitari del 118.

It takes a little over half an hour for the flames to devour Pedro Gomes's field at the edge of the Amazon rainforest, clearing the land for him to plant crops.
 Agricultural fires like this are burning through the world's biggest rainforest at an alarming rate, according to environmentalists using satellite data from Brazil's space agency, INPE, to track the destruction.
 But Gomes, a 48-year-old farmer with a cowboy hat and leathery brown skin, smiles as he watches his field go up in smoke.
 "Can you believe the INPE's satellites register this as a fire?" he says, as two donkeys tied up nearby watch the flames.
 His blaze, he insists, is not a fire but a "queimada," the traditional agricultural practice of clearing land by burning it during the dry season.
 "How do they expect us to plant without burning?" says Gomes (not his real name).
 His small 48-hectare (120-acre) farm is one of many burning around Novo Progresso, in northern Brazil.
 The town has been shrouded in smoke for several days as farmers increased the amount of fires lit in the area.
 The fuel for the fires are trees felled to clear forest for farming and ranching. Environmentalists say the fires are also fueled by the lack of consequences for those who illegally seize land and clear it.
 AFP reporters traveled thousands of kilometers along roads in the Brazilian states of Mato Grosso and Para, where large ranches with charred trees flank the roads and newly deforested land was waiting to be burned.
 Last year, the Amazon was devastated by tens of thousands of fires that sent a thick haze of black smoke 2,500 kilometers (15,000 miles) south to Sao Paulo, causing international outcry.
 This year, President Jair Bolsonaro's government is keen to avoid a repeat.
 The far-right president took office in 2019 with calls to roll back environmental protections in the Amazon to develop mining and agriculture.
 But more recently, he has tried to show he is taking action on deforestation, particularly after coming under pressure from the business sector to improve Brazil's image on protecting the Amazon, a vital resource for curbing climate change.
 In July, Bolsonaro banned agricultural burning for 120 days, and has deployed the army to fight the problem.
 August and September, the peak of the crisis last year, will be critical months to determine whether the measure has worked, as the government claims.
 In the 12 months to July 2020, deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon increased 34.5 percent year-on-year, according to INPE data.
 However, the government was quick to point out that the trend improved in July, when deforestation decreased by 36 percent compared to July 2019.
 \- 'Fire Day' -
 Last year, Novo Progresso was at the center of an episode known as "Fire Day," on August 10, when local farmers allegedly burned large amounts of land in a coordinated action.
 The point was purportedly to send a message to Bolsonaro: that they were holding him to his campaign rhetoric to roll back regulations protecting the Amazon.
 Some dispute that account, however.
 "The news media and environmental groups made that up," says Agamenon Menezes, the president of the Novo Progresso farmers' association.
 But environmentalists say fires rarely start naturally in the rainforest, because it is so wet. Many accuse Bolsonaro of encouraging people to set more blazes with his gung-ho rhetoric on developing the Amazon.
 That includes on indigenous reservations and other protected land seized by squatters and speculators.
 "People who seize protected lands mark their territory by razing the forest and putting cattle to pasture," says Beto Verissimo, founder of conservation group Imazon.
 "And once they cut the trees, the only way to convert the land into fields or pasture is to burn."
 Environmentalists say the budgets and staff of government agencies responsible for stopping deforestation are being gutted.
 Environment Minister Ricardo Salles acknowledged in a recent interview with AFP that those agencies had a staffing shortfall of 50 percent, though he blamed the problem on previous administrations.

Valerie Maria Cyr On Sunday, August 16th, 2020, Valerie Cyr, loving wife and mother of four children, passed away peacefully at the age of 79. She was lovingly cared for by Alice Barnum during the last 4 ½ years as she struggled with Alzheimer's. Valerie was born on June 22nd, 1941 in Bridgeport, CT to Paul and Jean (Szeman) Zapotocky. She attended Roger Ludlowe HS (Class of 1959) in Fairfield, CT, earned a Business Certificate from the Butler Business School in Bridgeport and had early success at Remington- DuPont, also in Bridgeport. She had two sons, Robert and Christopher, and two daughters, Amy and Jeannie with her first husband, Robert Herlihy. On October 28th, 1978 she married, Wayne Donald Cyr of New Haven, VT. Her first born, Robert, married Leslee Harton of Essex Jct. that same day for a double wedding. In 2018, they celebrated their 40th Wedding Anniversary at Project Independence where they spent quality time together. She worked at the Banknorth Group for 15 years. Valerie had a passion for music. She'd sit with her children, in front of the stereo, pointing out specifically what songs and lyrics were the ones to "listen" to. Her music taste was wide ranging and an education in itself. From Peter, Paul &amp; Mary and Johnny Cash to Judy &amp; Liza, Barbra Streisand and show tunes, music made her heart the happiest. Her fondest memories would always include the artists she got to see live, trips to NYC for Broadway musicals or cabaret at Don't Tell Mama. Valerie was always asking, "What's happening with music in New York? What's new to listen to?" She was also a joyful and avid reader. Maeve Binchy and Mary Higgins Clark were among her favorites. She took late night escapes sitting on the edge of the couch for hours, feet up on the coffee table, engrossed in these "other worlds". Valerie and her mother, Jean, shared their favorite books and she always looked forward to discussing them either on their many outings into town or over coffee as their houses in Underhill were next to each other. Valerie and husband Wayne, a carpenter, met and fell in love when he was building an addition on to her mother's house. Their first date was at The Olde Board Restaurant in Burlington and She and I by Alabama was one of their favorite songs. They always called each other sweetie and dear and later lived in Hinesburg and New Haven. They'll forever be holding hands "in their own little world…ain't it wonderful?" Valerie was known for her amazing smile, generous heart and big green eyes. She had a sharp wit and could be sarcastic. Her commitment to create a beautiful home and fun family barbeques was without fail. We'll remember her beef stew, tuna salad and all things Crock-Pot. She cherished the good times with her children and was proud to be ranked high among the "Cool Moms" by their friends. She was sweet as pie and one of the strongest women you'll ever meet. Valerie was preceded in death by her father, Paul, and mother, Jean and her two sons, Bobby and Chris. She is survived by her husband Wayne, her daughters, Amy and Jeannie (Carol-Lynne), her brother, Darren-Paul, her grandchildren Lisha, Jesse (Aimee), Barbie, Matthew, Erin, and Noah, 16 great-grandchildren and one great-great-grandchild. Visiting hours will be held on Thursday, August 20th at Brown-McClay Funeral Home in Vergennes from 5 to 7 p.m. A mass of Christian burial will be celebrated 10 a.m. on Friday, August 21st at St. Peter Catholic Church in Vergennes. Interment will be in Evergreen Cemetery in New Haven. In lieu of flowers, donations may be sent to Elderly Services Inc. (Project Independence) in Middlebury. To send online condolences to her family please visit www.brownmcclayfuneralhomes.com

There are a number of work streams dedicated to increasing the health workforce, and there has never been a better time to enter a career in health and social care. We have seen significant interest in the NHS and careers as a result of Covid-19, and potentially an opportunity to offer opportunities for retraining to those being made redundant or seeking a more rewarding career. Apprenticeships are an important part of this, but they need to sit alongside existing schemes - ones which often lead from entry to registration far more quickly than a four-year apprenticeship. This funding sharpens the focus and is very welcome. We need to understand the small print and a collaborative system-wide approach is critical.

The Monticello senior Long, meanwhile, began her outing with five consecutive bogeys.
 “Coming out, I was super nervous,” said Long, a 2019 News-Gazette All-Area second team pick. “I don’t know what was going on. But I came back, and I had three birdies on that same front nine.
 “But then I really played a pretty steady game for the back nine, so I would definitely say my back nine was better.”
 The scorecard doesn’t lie. Long rallied on Woodlawn’s gold-tee setup — the “back nine” — and finished her afternoon with a 78, bettering Erhard by 1 stroke to capture the 27-player tournament’s medalist honors.
 “It was really incredible,” Long said. “There’s a lot of great competition out here, and so I wasn’t really expecting to win. But it was really awesome to get to have that victory under my belt going into the rest of the season.”
 An event official, while announcing final instructions to spread-out athletes, said this was the smallest draw in the showcase’s history, impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Centennial, Olympia and Tri-Valley were scheduled to attend the meet but did not, and just half of the eight teams involved fielded enough golfers to achieve a group score.
 But that didn’t put a damper on any of Monday’s proceedings, even with spectators limited to a small segment of the course as a pandemic-related safety restriction and players donning masks throughout the day.
 “I just feel so fortunate,” Long said. “Even like a month ago, I just thought that we would never get to play — thought there was no chance. And so being able to come out here with my teammates again has just been an incredible opportunity.”
 Long is the Sages’ bona fide No. 1 scorer this year after forming a solid duo with now-graduated Molly Stringer, a 2019 N-G All-Area first-teamer.

Russell Crowe is known simply as “The Man” in the new action-suspense film “Unhinged” as the Academy Award-winning actor delivers a performance that’s evil personified. If your anxiety level isn’t already elevated because of the current pandemic, the first five minutes will take care of that. From there Derrick Borte’s unapologetic film takes road rage to “11” giving the audience thrilling car chases, brutal violence and one shocking moment after another. It’s not for the squeamish but guaranteed to keep you on the edge of your seat. Also, be prepared to add the phrase “courtesy tap” to your vocabulary.
 The film opens in a suburban neighborhood on a rainy night. Russell Crowe sits in his pickup truck parked outside a home while popping pills, checking the time on his phone (4:03 a.m.), and finally removing his wedding band then tossing it in the back seat — he’s clearly having a psychotic episode. He steps out of the vehicle armed with a hammer and a can of gas then proceeds to do his best Jack Nicholson impersonation as he breaks down the door in what resembles a scene from “The Shining.” It may feel like you’re watching a horror film as he savagely murders the couple inside and then proceeds to burn down the home. Yes, you could say he’s become unhinged.
 Cut to recently separated Rachel (Caren Pistorius) who is awakened in the morning by a phone call from her friend and lawyer Andy (Jimmi Simpson) — it’s not good news — her ex wants the house as part of the divorce settlement. She’s overslept and now is in a rush to get her son Kyle (Gabriel Bateman) to school on time. Rachel shares her home with her younger brother Fred (Austin P. McKenzie) and his girlfriend who are living there rent-free. So, as the hectic morning gets underway the local news reports on Crowe’s carnage, a double homicide and house burnt to the ground, with the prime suspect being the ex-husband who had a restraining order against him.
 The action moves to the streets of New Orleans (where it was filmed) and here’s where Borte really kicks the tension into high gear putting the audience on the edge of their seats with some of the best car chase sequences we’ve seen in quite a while. It’s terror in the rearview mirror all over again as “Unhinged” becomes an updated version of Steven Spielberg’s 1971 classic “Duel” with Russell Crowe’s Ford truck in the role of the 1955 Peterbilt 281 while Rachel’s Volvo station wagon fills in for Dennis Weaver’s 1971 Plymouth Valiant. The Volvo adds to the film’s 90s vibe and once the cat and mouse chase begins you may feel like you’re watching “Mad Max.”
 Prepare to add “courtesy tap” to your vocabulary. It’s the phrase Crowe uses before he unleashes hell on Earth for Rachel. The road rage begins after Rachel lays on the horn (three good, long blasts) after the truck in front of her doesn’t move when the light turns green. Of course, she doesn’t know the driver is a zoned-out Crowe who just committed a double murder. At the next light, he catches up with her and asks, “I don’t even get a courtesy tap first?” He then demonstrates with a couple of quick honks and adds “It’s light, it’s friendly like you’re trying to get somebody’s attention.” When Crowe asks, “Is a courtesy tap what you meant ma’am?” Rachel responds, “No it’s not!” and it's game on.
 “Unhinged” is a nasty piece of pulp fiction with a few plot loopholes (like Crowe snagging Rachel’s iPhone out her car and replacing it with a flip phone) but most audiences will look past them thanks to the destructive mayhem taking place on-screen, a nice distraction. Crowe brings to life a villain without much of a backstory that’s worthy of some of the vilest characters we’ve seen on screen in the past.
 South African-born New Zealand actress Pistorius is really good as Rachel who never turns into a bad-to-the-bone Charlize Theron-like hero. She’s no match for Crowe even when pushed over the limit time and time again but it’s an honest portrayal of an average soccer mom who makes one mistake after another. Strength may not be on her side, but she eventually begins to think like her antagonist.
 Will “Unhinged” become the first big Hollywood film to draw people back into theaters? We’ll have to wait and see. It’s not for the squeamish or anyone having a hard time dealing with anxiety but Borte’s film also provides a form of release as we watch these characters deal with horrific situations. It’s the same feeling you get from watching a horror film. I’ll admit there were a few scenes that reminded me of “Halloween” with Crowe filling in for Michael Meyers while Pistorius became Jamie Lee Curtis on wheels.

The pandemic is likely to impact commuting across the region for years to come, according to a new analysis from the Northern Virginia Transportation Authority. Its results paint a different picture than existed just months ago.
 Conducted by infrastructure engineering firm AECOM, the analysis predicts far lower vehicle miles traveled across the region in 2025 than would have otherwise occurred and, as a result, fewer traffic delays for the area’s commuters. It also projects much lower transit ridership, which could create problems for the region’s transit providers.
 According to NVTA’s Transportation and Programming Principal Keith Jasper and AECOM Consulting Manager David Roden, the analysis crunched a number of data points to make its projections, including current economic data, economic projections, traffic information and a weekly nationwide survey of about 1,000 people asking about travel habits and expectations. Participants in that survey, conducted by Heart+Mind Strategies, say they are expecting to return to work well ahead of when they expected to be letting a child return to school or daycare.
 The analysis projects that, all told, Northern Virginians will spend 31% less time traveling at all in 2025 than they would have.
 “Telework is a phenomenon that’s likely to affect professional services, communication technology folks, higher income type-industries that have that option and employers are finding that to be a fairly cost-effective solution for them,” Jasper said. “That may cause more industries to reduce their space, their real estate, or perhaps move to other locations that don’t require so much direct interaction.”
 NVTA Executive Director Monica Backmon said the analysis will help to guide decisions regarding which projects get necessary funding moving forward, both when the authority does its annual six-year plan plan update next summer and when it formulates its long-range TransAction plan, which is updated every five years. The directional plan that lays out the authority’s overarching priorities will be finished in 2022, but NVTA recently began the update process.
 “This is why the impact of COVID on the application network is so important, because we need to understand some of the baseline or underlying assumptions we need to include in the plan,” Backmon said. “Even though this is the long- range plan, the plan does inform our six-year program.”
 She also said that it will somewhat alter what the NVTA aims to do in the future. The trend of teleworking has a positive impact on the road network by limiting congestion. Backmon said that the authority would like to encourage continued teleworking even when the pandemic is over. But at the same time, the authority will look for ways to encourage transit use, which limits congestion in its own right and will remain a vital lifeline for working people who lack the option of telework.

The 19th Amendment was a critical milestone for women but Latah County Historical Society Executive Director Dulce Kersting-Lark said the ratification didn’t immediately grant every woman the right to vote and more still needs to be done to provide gender equity.
 “We’ve made a very conscious effort in our organization to make sure that when we offer programs, when we create content, that we are commemorating and not celebrating because celebrating I think makes it feel like it was a finite mission,” said Kersting-Lark, who is also running in November for a District 5 seat in the Idaho House of Representatives. “Women got the right to vote and we should celebrate and it was all done, and that’s not true because lots of women were excluded from that part of the movement.”
 Kersting-Lark, 31, of Moscow, said one example is that Native American women could not vote until 1924 when President Calvin Coolidge signed the Indian Citizenship Act, granting citizenship to Native Americans. The last state to fully guarantee voting rights to native people was Utah in 1962, but Kersting- Lark said natives were still prevented from voting because of poll taxes, literacy and intimidation.
 Another example, Kersting-Lark said, is women of color were largely excluded from the traditional suffrage movement and until the Civil Rights Act was passed in 1964, most women of color were still precluded from voting in one way or another.
 Idaho was the fourth state in the nation to grant women the right to vote. Idaho Gov. William McConnell, who built the McConnell Mansion in Moscow in 1886, signed off on the law in 1896.
 “We found out early on one of the challenges to doing a lot of very locally focused programs about women’s suffrage is that there’s just not that much information,” Kersting-Lark said. “It was seemingly not very controversial right here in Latah County.”
 She said she could not think of examples in which women voters are suppressed nowadays, but there are places where it is made more difficult for working parents who have to worry about child care or who have to stand for hours in long lines for voting booths.
 Kersting-Lark said voting in Idaho is extremely accessible. Voters can register on voting day at the polls or request an absentee ballot, no questions asked.
 “I think the spirit of the 19th Amendment is certainly alive and well,” she said. “I am grateful for the anniversary and the opportunity to draw people’s attention to it. For some people, maybe 100 years feels like a long time ago, but right now, this moment in time 100 years ago, I could not vote in a presidential election.”
 She said women worked hard to gain the right to vote, which she said is a fundamental right in a democracy.
 “It seems a pretty flimsy rationale in 2020 but it wasn’t that long ago that it was actually a debate amongst people — whether women had the mental capacity to vote, whether they would be corrupted by the vote, could their bodies physically handle the stress of being a voter and going to a public polling place?” she said. “To me, 100 years ago is not that long ago so I really want people to give some serious thought about how hard it was that we fought for that and what do we think today seems natural that 100 years from now our descendants might think, ‘Oh my gosh. That seems very backwards that they believed that so wholeheartedly.’ ”
 The Latah County Historical Society is sharing two copies of a poster exhibition originally curated by the U.S. National Archives. The exhibit, titled “Rightfully Hers,” commemorates the 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment. It explores the history of ratification of the women’s suffrage amendment, women’s voting rights before and after and its impact today.
 The four-poster exhibition is on display at the Potlatch Depot, in partnership with the Washington, Idaho and Montana Railway History Preservation Group, and at the Fraternal Temple in Kendrick, in partnership with the Juliaetta- Kendrick Heritage Foundation.
 At both locations the posters are installed in exterior windows so individuals can visit at their convenience and can safely maintain social distance from other visitors.
 Kersting-Lark said the historical society is trying to obtain a copy of an exhibit the Smithsonian Institute curated to install this summer in downtown Moscow storefronts.
 She said a small exhibit is posted at the Latah County Courthouse in Moscow and on the historical society’s website.
 Kersting-Lark said it is planning to bring a traveling exhibit about voting rights and the Civil Rights Act in November to Moscow. The intention is to create programming that links the women’s suffrage movement of the late 1800s and 1900s with the civil rights movement of the mid-20th century as well as tying in current voting rights.

Supporters of late Lebanese ex-premier Rafic Hariri voiced disappointment Tuesday over the verdict of UN-backed court on his 2005 assassination, despite Hariri's son hailing a triumph for truth.
 The Special Tribunal for Lebanon found Salim Ayyash, a member of the Shiite movement Hezbollah, guilty over the huge suicide bombing in Beirut killed the Sunni billionaire and 21 other people.
 But it cleared three other suspects after a years-long trial.
 Judges at the court also said there was no evidence to directly link Hezbollah's leadership or Syria -- the former military overlord in Lebanon -- to the attack.
 For some of Hariri's supporters in Lebanon, the verdict let Hezbollah off the hook.
 "At the end of the day, those accused are leaders of Hezbollah," said Amin Baroudy, a university student from the northern city of Tripoli.
 "Both me and my children (to come) will remain convinced that those that committed this crime are affiliated with Hezbollah," he added.
 Baroudy spoke to AFP from near Hariri's Beirut grave, where dozens of the former prime minister’s supporters had gathered during the day to watch a live stream of the verdict, 5,664 days after the blast rocked the city.
 Rafic's sister, Bahia, herself an MP, was among the crowd when the verdict blasted through the loudspeakers.
 Several lawmakers and politicians were also in attendance at the site, guarded by a heavy contingent of security forces.
 \- 'Court is a joke' -
 Hariri had been Lebanon's premier until his resignation in 2004 over Syria's role as powerbroker in the country.
 Observers had voiced fears that the verdict, whatever it was, would spark violence in the streets in Lebanon.
 But rather than anger, the prevailing mood among Hariri supporters was one of widespread disappointment.
 "We're now sure that the court is a joke," said Walid al-Hayek, a Hariri supporter from the eastern Bekaa Valley region.
 Ahmad al-Lakkis, from the northern city of Byblos, said the verdict was seen as "unjust" by many Lebanese.
 Faysal Itani, a deputy director at the Center for Global Policy, wrote on Twitter: "A Salim Ayyash guilty verdict is the very least that could have happened. Bringing us to baseline bad."
 But Rafic Hariri's son Saad, also a former prime minister and now the head of the Future Movement party founded buy his father, took a more positive tone.
 "Today, we have all discovered the truth," Saad Hariri said after the verdict, which he accepted on behalf of his family and the families of the other victims.
 A pro-Hariri political camp had been hoping for years that the international tribunal would firmly link the assassination to Hezbollah, a rival of the Future Movement.
 Hezbollah partisans, on the other hand, have dismissed the tribunal as politicised, expecting it would issue a wholesale guilty verdict against all suspects accused over the bombing.
 Karim Bitar, professor of international relations in Paris and Beirut, said reactions in Lebanon were polarised depending on party allegiance.
 Hezbollah supporters, "who have been questioning the tribunal's legitimacy for the past 15 years, seem comfortable with the verdict," he wrote on Twitter.
 Hariri backers, however, "who have been desperately waiting for 'truth and justice,' now seem depressed," he added.

MUSKEGON — Despite initially struggling to access COVID-19 relief funding, Ana Olson has kept Los Amigos Mexican Bar & Grill open with takeout orders throughout the entire pandemic. The Muskegon restaurant’s dine- in service shut down on March 16 because of Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s shelter in place mandate and reopened June 8. The restaurant at 1848 E. Sherman Blvd. pivoted to a family-style takeout menu and started serving up its popular margaritas to-go. And while Olson had to temporarily lay off most of her staff when dine-in services were closed — a reduction from 33 employees to four — most have been called back as limited dine-in services resumed. “We created a menu to do community-style meals so you’re not breaking the bank,” Olson said. “It helps us keep people coming back. If they want to take a break from cooking, they can get tacos from Los Amigos and it is still affordable.” While her business has survived the pandemic, Olson said accessing small business loan and grant funding programs has been a challenge. Additionally, while Muskegon’s city manager purchased nearly $200,000 worth of gift cards from local restaurants to support them during the pandemic, the initiative did not include outreach to Olson or two Chinese restaurants. The city’s attorney is in the process of investigating the gift card purchase with use of government funds, according to Muskegon City Commission meeting minutes. “It’s been difficult to not get overwhelmed,” Olson said. “(The city) left me out and they left out two other minority-owned businesses.” Despite this, Olson has partnered with the West Michigan Hispanic Chamber of Commerce to get help filling out loan and grant applications. Los Amigos was also able to secure a $10,000 loan from Grand Rapids Opportunities for Women (GROW), which has been working with the Community Foundation for Muskegon County to provide business owners recovery and working capital loans. “As someone who had never dealt with applying for a loan before, it was scary to first look at the application, but GROW addressed all of my worries,” Olson said. “Being both a female and a minority, it’s so reassuring to know there’s a group like GROW to help us. Because of them, I was able to secure funding and improve my business in these uncertain times.” The GROW funds are “critical” to help businesses like Los Amigos, said GROW CEO Bonnie Nawara. Even when businesses had to close because of the executive order, expenses like rent, insurance and other items continue to rack up, Nawara said. Olson was born and raised in Mexico, and came to the United States in 2006. She came to Muskegon in 2012 when she started helping her brother manage Los Amigos, an authentic from-scratch Mexican restaurant. They were able to buy the restaurant in 2015. Olson also serves on the board of directors for Latinos Working For the Future, a nonprofit organization seeking to unify and organize the growing Latinx population in the greater Muskegon area. Los Amigos frequently partners with local nonprofits for fundraisers and supports local groups, Olson said. When the pandemic hit, Olson said the restaurant wanted to make sure area children were still getting enough food as many families faced difficult financial times. “There were a lot of families that weren’t able to get any help because they didn’t qualify for unemployment or weren’t able to get CARES Act money from the federal government,” Olson said. Los Amigos was giving out free kids meals to families at the beginning of the pandemic, and the business now donates to Kids’ Food Basket. “We have a for-profit business, I’m here to make money, but I’m always looking for ways to help our community, especially the ones that rarely get help,” Olson said. “If someone comes and spends money with us, they’ll get delicious food. But at the same time, we’re involved in our community.” With dine-in now back open at 50-percent capacity, Olson has been able to call back her staff. About 10 employees chose not to return because they were taking care of a loved one or were in a high-risk group for getting COVID-19, Olson said, so she is now hiring new employees. “Business is down from where it should be, but we are able to make the bills and we are not in the red,” Olson said. “We are very grateful.”

Sounders owner Adrian Hanauer said it’s been a goal to find a partnership with Amazon as the company has grown.
 “It’s been a long, long process. We have had conversations off and on for years, and for sure when Marie got there continued to have conversations about where we might be able to form a partnership,” Hanauer said. “The conversations increased and then as our rights became free and clear, obviously Amazon was our No. 1 potential partner.”
 It’s also the second major sports-related move by Amazon in its hometown in recent months. The company purchased the naming rights for the future home arena of the Seattle Kraken, the NHL expansion franchise that will play its first season in 2021-22. The new facility will be named Climate Pledge Arena.

CHAMPAIGN — The Big Ten’s decision last week to postpone all fall sports was a sudden stop to the immediate preparation underway for Illinois football, volleyball and soccer and what was about to begin for Illini cross-country.
 But practices continued for the Illinois volleyball and soccer teams last week. Cross-country had a similar plan once its athletes exited the requisite quarantine period. The Illini football team will resume some iteration of a practice schedule when the team returns in conjunction with the start of classes this coming Monday.
 The Big Ten has decided it isn’t safe enough to compete. Practicing on your own campus? That still has the green light.

Amanda Wang's household organisations- a call centre and 2 dining establishments in Beijing- are coming to grips with a plunge in profits following the coronavirus break out. She enforced a company-wide 30 percent pay cut on about 120 employees in July even after getting tax cuts and work aids from the federal government developed to aid business make it through the pandemic.
 “My biggest challenge is a lack of business and policy support [from the government] isn’t helpful [on this],” states Ms Wang, referring to her choice to cut employees' incomes. “I have to make savings where I can.”
 Yet Ms Wang had no qualms about restoring her yearly Rmb150,000 ($ 21,000) subscription at a downtown beauty parlor in the Chinese capital. “I am not going to cut corners on my basic needs,” states the 41-year-old, who in July offered among her 6 homes in Beijing for a revenue of Rmb3m. “There are ways to make up for the income loss.”
 Li Erping, a waiter at one of Ms Wang's dining establishments, has far less alternatives to offset his lost revenues. He utilized to invest Rmb1,200 a month on an unique protein diet plan and workout. But he had to desert that in July after the pay cut was enforced.

But the U.S.’s internet infrastructure is vastly more complicated than China’s, after decades of support for the free flow of information.


  “I used to describe it to people this way,” Mieke Eoyang, former staﬀ member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, told Gizmodo. “It’s like China is on an island; the traffic to the island gets there via a handful of bridges, and they can put toll booths on the bridges. And the United States is on the mainland, and it’s surrounded by other countries. The data flows easily and quickly all throughout, and it is co-mingled.”


  A wall would require tearing down and rebuilding the internet, Eoyang explained, and the squandered time and effort would be an economically disastrous halt to whatever growth and innovation a nationalist blockade would supposedly aim to accomplish.


  “I think it’s inevitable that whenever we are discussing a plan for internet regulation, especially when China is involved, even on the other side, that the Great Firewall gets brought up,” James Griffiths, author of _The Great Firewall of China: How to Build and Control an Alternative Version of the Internet_ , told Gizmodo. But the comparison is “flawed,” Griffiths said, because the blockage of foreign services is a “minor” function compared to the censorship and surveillance that happens inside it, safeguarding a propaganda apparatus that stifles critics. (This includes WeChat, which does the same inside, and to some extent, beyond the wall.)


  The concerns here are legitimate, Griffiths reiterated. Gathering vast troves of data is par for the course in Silicon Valley, but that doesn’t necessarily make it acceptable for TikTok to do so. “TikTok may never be able to convince U.S. regulators that as a Chinese company they could resist an illegal order from Beijing, when push comes to shove, but if they weren’t hoovering up so much data in the first place, that wouldn’t be such a concern,” Griffiths said. WeChat was “likely overdue a reckoning” given long-running accusations that it’s been censoring users outside of China.


  The “Clean Network” plan does resemble “cyber sovereignty,” Griffiths noted, the concept that a country can shape and govern the internet within its borders, which might involve banning foreign apps, banning VPNs, or fencing in citizens’ data. Russia and China are codifying it into authoritarian policy, though even non-authoritarian governments might control the flow of data in the interest of economic protectionism or to prevent NSA spying on their citizens.


  But China similarly invokes national security as a justification to censor speech and ice out foreign competition. He does find the moves “concerning” — as a trial balloon for “similarly broad executive orders” for targets that may be “far less legitimate” or reasons that are “more self-serving.”

Jo Fowler (Martha Joan Fowler) March 2, 1936 - August 15, 2020 NORMAN Jo Fowler (Martha Joan Fowler) went home to be with the Lord on August 15, 2020 at the age of 84. She was born on March 2, 1936 in El Paso, Texas where she grew up and graduated from Ysleta High School. Her family then moved to Lubbock where she started a family of her own. In the early 1960's Jo and her three daughters moved to Dallas where she got an office job at a car dealership and met the love of her life, Bill Fowler. Bill was a car salesman with three boys of his own. By 1963 they were married and would soon move to Oklahoma City. Bill went to work for Gandara Buick which led to him opening Fowler Toyota in Norman, Oklahoma. Bill and Jo made their home in Norman where they would continue to raise their children and enjoy their grandchildren and great grandchildren. Shortly after moving to Oklahoma, Jo started volunteering at the National Cowboy Hall of Fame in OKC. She continued working there as a docent for almost 40 years and enjoyed every last minute of it. As western art collectors, Jo and Bill looked forward to attending the nation's premier Western art exhibition, Prix de West, every year at the museum. They also loved going on the museum's special art trips where they would travel the country touring esteemed Western artists' studios and homes to observe them at work and to view their own art collections. When Bill was not able to travel with Jo, she took her daughter Suzy. Jo was a very active member in the community. She was a Blue Bird and Camp Fire Girl Leader for seven years, teaching her girls many things along the way. She joined the Norman Garden Club shortly after moving to Norman and has been an active member ever since hosting many meetings and parties in her home. Jo was also a long time member of Norman Women's Connection, Xlibris Book Club and Assistance League. Jo and Bill were founding members of Bridgeview United Methodist Church in Norman. They were very involved in all aspects of the church and were great supporters of the church for many years. Jo especially loved teaching the adult Sunday School class every week. Jo had numerous hobbies such as reading, sewing, cooking, photography, going to the movies, but her very favorite of all had to be traveling the world. She claimed Hawaii and Australia were the best places she ever visited. Jo was also a very dedicated gardener and was known for her beautiful, lush gardens. She even had numerous turtles living in her garden who she adopted as pets. She was a wonderful wife and a great mother who enjoyed spending time with her children, grandchildren and great grandchildren more than anything else in the world. Jo is preceded in death by her husband Billy Fowler, her mother Vena Warwick, her father TW Wright, her step-father IA Warwick and her sister Joyce Wallace. She is survived by her children Pamela Washam, Marsha McGuire, Suzanne Griffin and husband Don, Bill Fowler Jr. and wife Aria, Michael Fowler and wife Terri, David Fowler and wife Pamela and Pam Brown. Grandchildren Ryan, William and wife Kathy, Jonathan and wife Natalie, Joshua, Shiloh, Cody, Dylan and wife Griselda, Stephanie and husband Alejandro, Michelle, Jennifer, Cassidy and great grandchildren Freedom, Lexington, Winnie, Wyatt, Ezra, Benjamin, Sofia, Leanna, Bobby, Lilly and Lucy. The family would like to thank Pam, Susan and Toni for the friendship, love and incredible care of our mother and her home over the many years. A special thank you to Barbara Moakley for allowing our mother to stay at home as long as possible through her genuine love, care, and friendship. Thank you to Angela, Kayla, Logan, Tommy, June, Alicia, Angie and the rest of the loving staff at The Gardens at Rivermont Memory Care for their kindness, strength and patience in caring for our mother. We would also like to thank Kiki, Lachelle, Lois, and Martinez from Centennial Hospice for the wonderful way they took care of our mother in her last stage of life. Flowers may be sent to Bridgeview United Methodist Church. If you would like to make a donation, Jo would love for you to donate to the National Cowboy &amp; Western Heritage Museum or Bridgeview United Methodist Church. A private memorial will be held on Thursday, August 20th. If you would like to watch the memorial through a livestream video, please contact Stephanie at (405) 639-8877 or Stephanie@fowlerholding.com for details.

Simply vending at a farmers market is not enough, she said, and a farmer or producer has to invest the time in finding the right market, contingent on location and competition from similar vendors, in order to be profitable. She started vending at the Niskayuna Farmers Markets (which she said splits a customer base with the longstanding Schenectady Greenmarket) and said, "if a market is close to home, you are more likely to shop there. It's an opportunity to find more truly local businesses with more farmers markets."

If you only want a month’s worth of tweets, Facebook posts, and Instagram posts on record, then it’s an option well worth considering.


  There is the option of Stories on Instagram (and Facebook), of course, a Snapchat idea so good that everyone else just copied it — these 24-hour-long bursts of content don’t stick around, which means there’s no need to clean up your social media profiles afterwards. There’s nothing to stop your friends from screenshotting them, but otherwise your public-facing social media history is relatively safe with Stories.

 Reportuit Hace un tiempo informamos sobre un niño de primaria que elaboró una máquina de Rube Goldberg cuyo objetivo era atrapar un juguete mediante una serie de complicados pasos. En esta oportunidad, un grupo de ingenieros de la Universidad de Purdue (Indiana, Estados Unidos) construyó uno de estos aparatos mucho más “sofisticado“ y fijó un nuevo récord mundial. El equipo de profesionales pasó más de 5 mil horas de trabajo para terminar su dispositivo, que “sirve“ para inflar un globo y hacerlo explotar en 300 pasos. La anterior marca, obtenida por el mismo equipo, consistía en un sistema de 244 pasos. Lo interesante de esta nueva máquina es que tiene tableros giratorios y no tiene solamente un recorrido lineal. El concurso de Rube Goldberg Machine se remonta de 1949 a 1955, cuando empezó como una competencia entre dos fraternidades de Purdue. En 1983, fue un concurso abierto a todos los estudiantes de dicho lugar. En tanto, el primer concurso nacional se llevó a cabo en 1988, según informa la página web de World Records Academy.

Legislative leaders said for decades that they could not muster support to change the flag, but momentum changed rapidly after Minneapolis police killed a Black man named George Floyd and protests against racial injustice happened across the U.S., including outside the Mississippi Governor’s Mansion. The final push to change the flag came from business, education, religion and sports leaders.
 Legislators created a nine-member commission, and that group received nearly 3,000 designs from the public. Commissioners will choose one design Sept. 2, and that will go on the Nov. 3 ballot. If voters accept the design, it will become the new Mississippi flag. If they reject it, the commission will find a new design to go on the ballot later.
 Even as the commission is working toward a new flag, some Mississippi residents are rebelling against change. Organizers of a group called Let Mississippi Vote said Monday that they are starting an initiative to put the old Confederate-themed flag and three other flag designs on the statewide ballot. But the initiative process is burdensome, and their efforts will be complicated by the coronavirus pandemic. If the initiative gets to the ballot, that election could be a year or two away. And, Mississippi could be flying a new flag by then.

A father and his two children while out hiking helped rescue a man who was stranded in the Santa Fe National Forest for 14 days.
 John Utsey launched an unexpected two-day rescue mission Saturday after hearing a call for help while hiking with his kids up to Windsor Trail toward the Santa Fe Baldy, KRQE-TV reported.
 “I’m not sure he had more than a day or two left,” said Utsey, who was the first to find the hiker in distress.
 Utsey heard his voice after calling for his daughter who walked up the trail and out of sight. He immediately began searching for the man, who was found 20 minutes later and about 600 yards (550 meters) off the trail down a steep hillside.

Valerie Maria Cyr      On Sunday, August 16th, 2020, Valerie Cyr, loving wife and mother of four children, passed away peacefully at the age of 79. She was lovingly cared for by Alice Barnum during the last 4 ½ years as she struggled with Alzheimer's.      Valerie was born on June 22nd, 1941 in Bridgeport, CT to Paul and Jean (Szeman) Zapotocky. She attended Roger Ludlowe HS (Class of 1959) in Fairfield, CT, earned a Business Certificate from the Butler Business School in Bridgeport and had early success at Remington-DuPont, also in Bridgeport. She had two sons, Robert and Christopher, and two daughters, Amy and Jeannie with her first husband, Robert Herlihy. On October 28th, 1978 she married, Wayne Donald Cyr of New Haven, VT. Her first born, Robert, married Leslee Harton of Essex Jct. that same day for a double wedding. In 2018, they celebrated their 40th Wedding Anniversary at Project Independence where they spent quality time together. She worked at the Banknorth Group for 15 years.      Valerie had a passion for music. She'd sit with her children, in front of the stereo, pointing out specifically what songs and lyrics were the ones to "listen" to. Her music taste was wide ranging and an education in itself. From Peter, Paul & Mary and Johnny Cash to Judy & Liza, Barbra Streisand and show tunes, music made her heart the happiest. Her fondest memories would always include the artists she got to see live, trips to NYC for Broadway musicals or cabaret at Don't Tell Mama. Valerie was always asking, "What's happening with music in New York? What's new to listen to?"      She was also a joyful and avid reader. Maeve Binchy and Mary Higgins Clark were among her favorites. She took late night escapes sitting on the edge of the couch for hours, feet up on the coffee table, engrossed in these "other worlds". Valerie and her mother, Jean, shared their favorite books and she always looked forward to discussing them either on their many outings into town or over coffee as their houses in Underhill were next to each other.      Valerie and husband Wayne, a carpenter, met and fell in love when he was building an addition on to her mother's house. Their first date was at The Olde Board Restaurant in Burlington and She and I by Alabama was one of their favorite songs. They always called each other sweetie and dear and later lived in Hinesburg and New Haven. They'll forever be holding hands "in their own little world…ain't it wonderful?"      Valerie was known for her amazing smile, generous heart and big green eyes. She had a sharp wit and could be sarcastic. Her commitment to create a beautiful home and fun family barbeques was without fail. We'll remember her beef stew, tuna salad and all things Crock-Pot. She cherished the good times with her children and was proud to be ranked high among the "Cool Moms" by their friends. She was sweet as pie and one of the strongest women you'll ever meet.      Valerie was preceded in death by her father, Paul, and mother, Jean and her two sons, Bobby and Chris. She is survived by her husband Wayne, her daughters, Amy and Jeannie (Carol-Lynne), her brother, Darren-Paul, her grandchildren Lisha, Jesse (Aimee), Barbie, Matthew, Erin, and Noah, 16 great- grandchildren and one great-great-grandchild.      Visiting hours will be held on Thursday, August 20th at Brown-McClay Funeral Home in Vergennes from 5 to 7 p.m. A mass of Christian burial will be celebrated 10 a.m. on Friday, August 21st at St. Peter Catholic Church in Vergennes. Interment will be in Evergreen Cemetery in New Haven. In lieu of flowers, donations may be sent to Elderly Services Inc. (Project Independence) in Middlebury.
