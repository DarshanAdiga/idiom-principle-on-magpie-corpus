Roberson was working as a security guard and, according to an attorney for his mother, was wearing a hat emblazoned with “security” across the front when he was fatally shot as he was trying to detain a suspect in a separate shooting that wounded several other people at the tavern.
 Almost immediately, there were questions about whether race played a role in the shooting, with one suburban Chicago alderman, Keith Price, of nearby Harvey, complaining at the time that the officer “just sees a Black man with a gun and kills him.”
 There were conflicting reports about what happened in the moments before Covey opened fire. Several witnesses told investigators that the officer fired despite people shouting that Roberson was a security guard. Myrickes, who was shot in the shoulder in the initial shooting, said he never heard Covey order Roberson to drop his weapon before he fired.
 In an interview from his hospital bed after the shooting, Myrickes told The Associated Press that Roberson was holding a suspect at gunpoint when he was shot and was wearing a black sweatshirt with the word “Security” on the back of the shoulder. He acknowledged, though, that the officer might not have been able to see the lettering from where he was standing.
 The State Police issued a statement at the time saying that Roberson was wearing “plain black clothing with no markings readily identifying him as a security guard.” The agency also said that witnesses told investigators that the officer did order Roberson to drop his weapon before he fired.
 In Friday's news release, Foxx did not detail the evidence that led her office to conclude that charges weren't warranted.
 A civil rights lawsuit against the officer and the community where he works was filed days after the shooting. It was not immediately clear if that lawsuit had been settled.

(AP) - President Donald Trump has several strikes against him — age, obesity, elevated cholesterol and being male — that could put him at greater risk of becoming seriously ill from the coronavirus infection he disclosed late Thursday.Trump and first lady Melania Trump, who also tested positive, “are both well at this time” and plan to remain at the White House while recovering and being closely monitored, according to a statement from his physician, Dr. Sean Conley.A White House official said Friday that Trump was having mild symptoms.“The odds are far and away that he’ll have a mild illness” as most people with the virus do, said Dr. Gregory Poland, an infectious disease specialist at the Mayo Clinic who has no role in Trump’s care.But COVID-19 is very unpredictable, he stressed.“We have young people who die. We have nursing home patients, a lot of them, who actually do quite well,” Poland said.No treatments have proven effective for preventing illness in someone who is infected but with no or mild symptoms. That includes hydroxychloroquine, a drug Trump long promoted and even took himself earlier this year after a White House staffer tested positive for the virus.Here’s what experts say about Trump’s outlook and next steps.SIGNS AND SYMPTOMSInfection causes mild or no symptoms in about 80% of cases. About 15% of people become seriously ill and 5% get critically ill.Symptoms, when they do occur, usually appear two to 14 days after infection and can include loss of smell or taste, coughing, a sore throat, trouble breathing, fatigue, muscle or body aches, headache, nausea or vomiting, diarrhea and fever.Up to half of patients who are hospitalized don’t have a fever when admitted but nearly all develop one. How people fare varies widely — some seem to be recovering and then suddenly worsen.Pneumonia, often with a specific appearance on X-rays, sometimes develops but complications in virtually every organ of the body have been reported.Doctors also increasingly recognize that some people have long- lasting symptoms.TRUMP’S RISKSOlder age, being male and having any other health problems increase the chance of severe illness, and Trump has those.At 74, “his age would be the primary risk factor,” said Dr. David Banach, an infectious diseases physician at the University of Connecticut’s health system.People ages 65 to 74 are seven times more likely to be hospitalized for COVID-19 than those who are 18 to 29 years old,&nbsp;according to&nbsp;the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The risks rise exponentially at older ages.Trump also is obese, with a body mass index just past 30.“Obesity is a state of chronic lowered immunity. In other words, you don’t respond to vaccines as well, you don’t respond to infections as well” as people of normal weight, Poland said.Trump takes a statin drug to lower his cholesterol, and that condition also raises his risk for COVID-19 complications, doctors said.Wearing your mask can help slow the spread of COVID-19. CDC’s Dr. Paige Armstrong shows you how to correctly put on and take off your mask.NEXT STEPSThere’s no need yet for tests such as X-rays, but doctors likely will check him often for any difficulty breathing, coughing or other symptoms, Banach said.No drugs are known to help for people with no or very mild symptoms; remdesivir and steroids have shown benefit for certain moderately and severely ill patients.Nevertheless, Dr. David Boulware, a University of Minnesota infectious disease specialist who has led studies of some coronavirus treatments, speculated that Trump’s doctors might try promising therapies being tested in studies now, such as antibody drugs or convalescent plasma — blood from COVID-19 survivors.“More than likely, he’s going to get treated upfront,” Boulware said. “They’re not going to just sit around and watch to see if he gets sick.”RISK TO OTHERSCould Trump have infected Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden during the debate Tuesday night?Possible, but hopefully not likely, experts said. The candidates were more than 6 feet apart. But both candidates, especially Trump, spoke loudly, which research suggests can make virus particles travel farther, Poland said. "We can be sure that Joe Biden is being tested, he said.A myriad of other people who’ve been around Trump in the previous 48 hours are at risk, doctors said.“Contact tracing is going to be really important,” Banach said. “The president comes into contact with many individuals during the day.”___The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

According to the author, there are at least three options being discussed in China for its next steps. The first option is a war that ends war, which means that "Beijing should finally strengthen its resolve and take the initiative to deter India with a war that ends wars, just like it did in 1962." The Chinese who believe in this option say that "if China were to back off, it will only confirm to India China's reluctance and/or inability to counter India, hence inviting more aggressive behaviors from India down the road."   The author opined that this view is closely linked to that of the development in the West Pacific, specifically Taiwan.

Sept. 30 -- To the Editor:
   
 In Tuesday's presidential "debate" Donald Trump was a petulant child. Lying, cheating, barking, bullying, he hijacked it.
   
 It was the ugliest debate in recent history featuring constant interruptions and lying by Trump, the Republican presidential nominee. He observed that it was "not a Lincoln-Douglas debate, that's for sure," referring to the series of lengthy debates Abraham Lincoln took part in before becoming president.
   
 The president is an active volcano in human form, superheated, seething then erupting for no reason other than he can. He has become so accustomed to other humans instinctively distancing themselves and cowering before him he's come to believe he can wave his hand dismissively or stomp on anyone verbally and they'll wither before his omniscient presence. In truth, our "leader" has little leadership talent, zero tolerance of others who usually wilt before him, and zero self-control.
   
 Zero control means out of control. He's a bully. His game is dominance for domination's sake. He's in a stage of adolescence yearning to dictate. By now, it should be clear to all thinking humans that America's president is not a leader. But, the scary part of all this is that…he is our "leader," his version.
   
 Missing from the "debate" were huge outdoor crowds surrounded by a ring of blazing bonfires reminiscent of Hitler. Yes, I've lived that long. The Fuhrer could mesmerize thousands of people whom he turned against their neighbors. He raged against whatever upset him at the moment and the crowds cheered him on. It wasn't a pretty sight, nor are our "debates" now. They're a sham. They're not even debates in the true sense. What we watch are bombastic seething, livid, raging takeovers of the "debates" despite every attempt by the moderator to bring a semblance of rationality to the scene. Trump chews up moderators and spits them out as he does almost every other person. One of the standout personality traits of such people is complete dominance, not partial, complete. And, that's very scary
   
 Some have observed a new debate format is needed, but the president most likely will chew that up, too, and spit it out. He governs by decree, not by constitutional law. He laughs at that. His version of winning is everybody else loses…"I'm in control here." True, he is in control of all he surveys, except himself.
   
 So, here we are, in the backwoods of governance with absolutely the wrong "leader." Here we are, in the wasteland of governance in our Congress which is huffing and puffing and nearly impotent. It's the eleventh hour. It's almost too late.

The National Academies' priorities will be considered by the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices as it drafts its own recommendations. At the panel's Sept. 22 meeting, CDC staff presented side-by-side maps, showing how closely the Social Vulnerability Index mirrors COVID-19 cases and deaths.
 State and local public health departments will have flexibility in how they implement the recommendations, said committee chairman Dr. Jose Romero, Arkansas’ health secretary. Minorities are overrepresented in health care and other essential industries, so prioritizing those groups — in theory — should increase access for Blacks and Hispanics.
 What's most pressing now, he said, is the need to start explaining the independent checks in place to make sure vaccines are safe. Sharing vaccine safety data when it's available will boost confidence among groups hesitant to get the shots, he said.
 “Among the Latino population in my state, I'm hearing terms like ‘experimentation.’ People say, ‘We don’t want to receive this until it’s shown safe in other populations,'" Romero said. “You can have the best vaccine in the world, but if people don’t have confidence in that vaccine, it will do no good. It will sit on the shelf.”

Delhi Capitals have played three matches so far, registering two wins and a defeat. After winning their initial two games, the team suffered a defeat against Sunrisers Hyderabad by 15 runs.
 Harris said they were not at their best for that game but there is no reason to panic.
 "Coming off an unlucky loss, we just were not at our best for that game against the Sunrisers Hyderabad. But, there's no panicking by any means," he said.
 "When you look back at it, a couple of balls during our bowling were a little bit of a miss, and they (SRH) probably ran better between the wickets, we didn't run as well. But 15 runs is not a huge gap," Harris added.
 Delhi Capitals will also play in Sharjah for the first time this season tomorrow, and Harris is expecting a high-scoring encounter.
 "Obviously, it's a new ground for us and games there have been pretty high- scoring, so it''s the other element we are looking at, at the moment," expressed the former Australian pacer.
 Harris also believes that the competition this year is probably the closest that he can remember.

 "Coming into the tournament, everyone was saying the same thing that there are no clear favourites this season. I think the competition this year is probably the closest that I can remember and I've been involved in a few seasons overall. I think everyone is virtually sitting on the same points, it is going to be close. The games that come down to the wire are the ones you need to win to make sure you're in those playoffs spots or in the top-two positions," he said.
 "With this whole COVID situation, the guys didn't really train before coming here, but put in some excellent work into the nets session for the three weeks leading up to the tournament. Coming into the game, we backed off a bit to make sure our energy levels were recharged. It's now important to make sure the boys can maintain their energy levels, and not get cooked up. T20 is a fast game and the boys need all their energy, so we're making sure to give them sufficient rest as well in between matches," he added.

Without a doubt the most colorful reference to bears is found in the tale of the prophet Elisha. In this passage the prophet was traveling and passed a group of obnoxious teens. The prophet had been saddened by the loss of his mentor the prophet Elijah and was in no mood for trouble. Scripture says of Elisha, “He went up from there to Bethel, and while he was going up on the way, some small boys came out of the city and jeered at him, saying, “Go up, you baldhead! Go up, you baldhead!” And he turned around, and when he saw them, he cursed them in the name of the Lord. And two she-bears came out of the woods and tore forty-two of the boys.” (II Kings 2:23-4)
