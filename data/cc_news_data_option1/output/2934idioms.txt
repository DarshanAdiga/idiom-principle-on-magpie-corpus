SELMA, Ala. (AP) — The late U.S. Rep. John Lewis will cross Selma’s Edmund Pettus Bridge for the final time Sunday as remembrances continue for the civil rights icon. Lewis' casket will be carried in a processional across the Selma bridge where he and other civil rights marchers were beaten 55 years ago on "Bloody Sunday," a key event in the fight for voting rights for African Americans. Lewis will lie in repose at the Alabama Capitol on Sunday afternoon.A series of events began Saturday in Lewis' hometown of Troy, Alabama, to pay tribute the late congressman and his legacy. He will lie in state at the U.S. Capitol next week before his private funeral Thursday at Atlanta's historic Ebenezer Baptist Church, which the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. once led.A native of Pike County, Alabama, Lewis became involved in the civil rights movement as a young man. In 1965, he and other marchers were beaten in Selma. The news coverage of the event help galvanize support for the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Lewis' family has asked members of the public not to travel from across the country to pay their respects. Instead, they suggested people pay virtual tribute online using the hashtags #BelovedCommunity or #HumanDignity. Lewis, 80, died July 17 several months after he was diagnosed with advanced pancreatic cancer.Copyright 2020 Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Amendment 4, which allowed convicted felons who complete "all terms of sentence" the right to vote, passed with nearly 65% of the vote, exceeding the 60% threshold required.
 Florida Rights Restoration Coalition was one of the authors of Amendment 4 and pushed for its inclusion on the ballot.
 After Amendment 4 went into effect in January 2019, the GOP-led Florida Legislature passed, and Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis signed, a bill that clarified "all terms of sentence" to include legal financial obligations such as fines, fees and restitution.
 The law was quickly challenged in court by voting rights advocates who argued that the law amounted to a "poll tax."
 A US district judge ruled in May that Floridians with prior felony convictions can't be barred from voting because they still owe court fines or fees that they are unable to pay. A federal appeals court in Atlanta this month blocked the judge's order, keeping the law in place. A hearing in the case is set for August 18 -- the same day as Florida's primary elections.

From filling in for certain stars throughout his long and illustrious career to guest-starring on other shows and hosting many a star on his own show, Regis was the kind of celebrity that just about anyone and everyone could like since he was the guy that tried to like everyone. Obviously there were those that he might not have gotten along with from time to time, it's part of show business after all, and being human to boot. But all in all, Regis was the kind of guy that people couldn't get enough of sometimes since his sense of humor and his ability to make people feel comfortable were a couple of his greatest strengths. Like many other celebrities that have passed in this last decade, he carved out his place in show business and made it clear that he was going to stick around for a while. When the curtain falls for the last time though it's time to pay those last respects and give a big thank you to those that keep us entertained. You'll be missed sir, rest in peace.

Helen menade att William Faulkner förstås är en viktigare författare, men att Margaret Mitchells ”Gone with the wind” är den utan jämförelse bästa boken om Södern och inbördeskriget. I den beskrivs Södern som den aldrig var, men som alla utom de svarta slavarna ville att den skulle ha varit. Inte minst i efterhand. I ”Borta med vinden” är även vad som är förljuget och fult vackert; särskilt då i den film som 1939 gjordes på boken. Visserligen skrev Faulkner sanningen om Södern, bara det att ingen vill höra obehagliga sanningar om de inte är vackra. Enligt Helen var det i sin ordning att Faulkner söp, men inte att han skrev att alla andra också gjorde det.

CORPUS CHRISTI, Texas (AP) - South Texas braced for flooding Sunday after Hanna roared ashore as a hurricane the day before, bringing winds that lashed the Gulf Coast with rain and storm surge to a part of the country trying to cope with a spike in cases of the coronavirus.The first hurricane of the 2020 Atlantic cyclone season made landfall twice as a Category 1 storm on Saturday afternoon within the span of little over an hour. The first landfall happened at around 5 p.m. about 15 miles (24 kilometers) north of Port Mansfield, which is about 130 miles (209 km) south of Corpus Christi. The second landfall took place nearby in eastern Kenedy County. Hanna came ashore with maximum sustained winds of 90 mph (145 kph).Forecasters downgraded Hanna to a tropical storm early Sunday. The storm had maximum sustained winds at 60 mph (95 kph), the National Hurricane Center said in a 4 a.m. advisory.Many parts of Texas, including areas near where Hanna came ashore, have been dealing with a surge in coronavirus cases in recent weeks, but local officials said they were prepared for whatever the storm might bring.Chris Birchfield, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Brownsville, said residents needed to remain alert. Hanna's winds weakened, but the storm's real threat remained heavy rainfall."We're not even close to over at this point," Birchfield said. "We're still expecting catastrophic flooding."Forecasters said Hanna could bring 6 to 12 inches (15 to 30 centimeters) of rain through Sunday night — with isolated totals of 18 inches (46 centimeters) — in addition to coastal swells that could cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.Some areas in South Texas had already reported receiving up to 9 inches (23 centimeters) of rain, including Cameron County, which borders Mexico and where Brownsville is located. Rainfall totals were expected to rise throughout the evening and into Sunday."It's been all day," Melissa Elizardi, a spokeswoman for Cameron County Judge Eddie Treviño, said of the rainfall.In a tweet, President Donald Trump said his administration was monitoring Hanna, along with Hurricane Douglas, which was heading toward Hawaii in the Pacific Ocean.Sherry Boehme, who lives in a condo along the beach in Corpus Christi, said the storm's approach had increased the anxiety she has felt during the pandemic. The 67-year-old has mostly stayed at home because of health issues related to chronic lung disease."It's almost like a double whammy to us," Boehme said Saturday by phone. "I think it's made a lot of people nervous. ... We'll get through it. Everybody is good and strong and sticks together."Hanna came nearly three years after Hurricane Harvey made landfall northeast of Corpus Christi. Hanna was not expected to be as destructive as Harvey, which killed 68 people and caused an estimated $125 billion in damage in Texas.First responders in Corpus Christi proactively placed barricades near intersections to have them ready to go if streets began to flood, Mayor Joe McComb said. More than 43,700 people throughout South Texas, including Corpus Christi, Harlingen and Brownsville, were without power Saturday evening, according to AEP Texas.The U.S. Coast Guard was called to help with the rescue of a couple on a sailboat that was taking on water Saturday evening in a harbor near Corpus Christi, spokesperson Paige Hause said. A swiftwater rescue team assisted in getting the couple back to land without injuries.Corpus Christi is in Nueces County, where health officials made headlines when they revealed that 60 infants tested positive for COVID-19 from July 1 to July 16.Farther south in Cameron County, more than 300 confirmed new cases have been reported almost daily for the past two weeks, according to state health figures. The past week has also been the county's deadliest of the pandemic.Coastal states scrambled this spring to adjust emergency hurricane plans to account for the virus, and Hanna loomed as the first big test.South Texas officials' plans for any possible rescues, shelters and monitoring of the storm will have the pandemic in mind and incorporate social distancing guidelines and mask wearing. Cameron County planned to open at least three evacuation shelters. Other counties and cities throughout South Texas had also opened shelters, with many requiring face masks.Gov. Greg Abbott said Saturday that some sheltering would take place in hotel rooms so people could be separated."We cannot allow this hurricane to lead to a more catastrophically deadly event by stoking additional spread of COVID-19 that could lead to fatalities," Abbott said.Various resources and personnel to respond to the storm were on standby across the state, including search-and-rescue teams and aircraft.Abbott said he has issued a disaster declaration for 32 counties in Texas and had asked the federal government to approve a similar declaration.Tornadoes were also possible overnight Saturday into Sunday for parts of the lower to middle Texas coastal plain. A tropical storm warning was in effect Sunday morning from Barra el Mezquital in Mexico to Baffin Bay, Texas. Earlier warnings and watches were discontinued, forecasters said.Mexico's northeasternmost states, coastal Tamaulipas and Nuevo Leon just to its west, also took precautions ahead of the storm's arrival. Tamaulipas disinfected shelters to try to avoid spreading COVID-19, the state's governor, Francisco Cabeza de Vaca, tweeted. Meanwhile, the civil protection department was sending rescue boats and other equipment to northern Nuevo Leon because heavy rains were expected.David León, the national director of the civil protection department, told Milenio TV on Saturday that as many as 800 shelters could be activated in the parts of Mexico that could be affected by Hanna.In the Mexican city of Matamoros, which is in Tamaulipas and across the border from Brownsville, Texas, volunteers were keeping a close eye on Hanna, worried that the storm could affect a makeshift migrant camp near the Rio Grande where about 1,300 asylum seekers, including newborn babies and elderly residents, have been waiting under the U.S. immigration policy informally known as "Remain in Mexico."Meanwhile, Douglas was expected to be near the main Hawaiian Islands late Saturday night and will move over parts of the state Sunday and Monday. A hurricane warning was in effect for Oahu County.___Lozano reported from Houston.

Reflecting on his days in the streets, Lewis demurred, “In another day in another time, there were brave and courageous young people who followed the teaching of Gandhi, the teaching of Martin Luther King Jr. They literally put their bodies on the line. So when I was beaten and left bloody and unconscious, and I thought I saw death and I was going to die, I never turned to hate.” — CNN, July 18.
 Amazingly, Lewis was never bitter. That we could all emulate him!
 Lewis’s congressional colleague Democratic Rep. Jim Clyburn, South Carolina’s 6th District, spoke to CNN on the Saturday afternoon following Lewis’s passing.
 “‘I was prepared for this,’” Clyburn said of his ‘personal friend’ and colleague. ‘But nevertheless, it is something that gives you a strange emptiness. Knowing full well that I will return to Washington, I won’t see him, and I will never get to sit with him again.’” — CNN, July 18.
 Indeed, realizing that Lewis is not working in Congress, realizing that he will not be on news shows speaking his words of strength and serenity leaves an emptiness. Even so, Lewis has left a legacy for us to carry on, for us to draw strength from.
 In honor of Lewis, Rep. Clyburn suggested the Edmund Pettus Bridge be renamed.
 “The bridge in Selma, Alabama, was where Lewis and other protesters were beaten (on March 7) in 1965 by Alabama state troopers as they attempted to march from Selma to Montgomery to protest the lack of voting rights for Black Americans. The event is known as “Bloody Sunday.”
 Clyburn explained, “I would love to see him (the President) rename that bridge, because you know it’s named for a grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan and for them to rename that bridge, in John’s honor, would be great.” — CNN, July 18.
 No doubt Lewis more than deserves the honor. Yet, the story of the Klansman‘s bigotry and cruelty may be beneficial. It might act as a cautionary story for future generations.
 Rep. Clyburn also suggested that those who claim a desire to honor Lewis as “... a genuine hero, a Black Lives Matter icon” should rename the voting rights act. The name, of course, to be the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Act of 2020. That done, they should make certain that act is signed into law, forthwith.
 According to ABC News, last “... December, House Democrats passed the Voting Rights Advancement Act of 2019 which would restore certain key protections of the 1965 Voting Rights Act against racial discrimination that the Supreme Court struck down in 2013.”
 “I know that if he was still with us, he would be leading that fight,” Rep. Karen Bass, D-Calif., said, referring to Lewis.
 “’What we have to do is live up to his legacy. We need to continue that fight for social justice. And again, the first thing we need to do is to pass the voting rights act and get it signed,’ Bass told ABC’s ‘This Week’ Co-anchor Martha Raddatz.”
 Indeed! How soon can that act be signed? Certainly, given that Lewis’s life was spent making sacrifices to ensure everyone’s right to vote, the best way to honor him is with the prompt passage of the voting rights (of 2019) bill which currently resides on Sen. Mitch McConnell’s desk. Renaming that advancement bill for Lewis only seems appropriate.
 John R. Lewis’s words always inspired hope. Each time it seemed that our nation was failing to come to grips with our legacy of slavery and slavery’s sad remnants, Lewis offered encouraging words, either in print or over the airwaves.
 His words will be missed; however, his memory will continue to inspire, to energize and galvanize people to fight for justice.
 We must continue to heed Lewis’s words and follow his lead.
 “Hold only love, only peace in your heart, knowing that the battle of good to overcome evil is already won.
 “Choose confrontation wisely, but when it is your time don’t be afraid to stand up, speak up, and speak out against injustice.” — J.R. Lewis.

Is there someone who is so knowledgeable in economics that he can plan and pilot our sustainable take-off, while simultaneously alleviating poverty and thereby pre-empting a social backlash? The answer is obvious and it is yes, there is.

Not being with his family fills him with fear. This makes him weaker. He dies two weeks later, not from COVID-19, but from a weak heart that was stressed beyond mending. An image of a young man who wants to provide for his three children and was able to do so until three weeks after the shelter-in-place orders began. Then he lost his job and the income that came with it.

“I think parents should be able to choose what they feel is safest for their children and their families, and honestly the same for teachers and staff,” another parent wrote, adding, “At this point my ideal would be to start the school year solely distance learning with an option to let them go back in the building, if and when I feel it is safe. I do have a strong feeling we will be home schooling though, I just don’t feel safe putting them in the building yet. And my heart breaks for staff members that feel the same way and have no choice.”
 Another wrote, “Kids just want a ‘normal’ routine, but right now that’s not possible. No sitting together in the lunchroom, no playing recess games, social distancing and masks worn at all times. This is not the routine needed right now. Why put teachers, bus drivers, cafeteria workers, and so many more at risk so your kid can see their friends. This isn’t forever and kids feed off our energy; so if distance learning it is, then make it fun somehow.”
 Not So Normal
 With so many varied thoughts and feelings around the opening of area schools, anxiety levels are high as things move forward in a “not so normal” fashion. Even with the opening of Phase 4 in New York state or the Green Phase in Pennsylvania, things don’t appear as they did before, with face covering protocols and social distancing widening the social connection and interaction among residents — particularly children, and students.
 However, in a report published by The Center Square, it was noted that western countries worldwide are making a case that children should be returning to in- person classrooms in the fall.
 The article cited a report published by the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto that wrote, “While school closures may have been reasonable as part of the early pandemic response, current evidence and experience support the concept that children can return to school in a manner that maximizes children’s health and minimizes risks from a Public Health perspective.”
 In the British daily national newspaper The Times, it was reported that there has been no recorded case of a teacher catching the coronavirus from a pupil anywhere in the world, according to Mark Woolhouse, one of the British government’s leading scientific advisers.
 But not everyone is seeing things the same way as complex emotions, including fear and anxiety that this pandemic evokes as we begin to emerge from our national quarantine to become a driving force for individual decisions among parents and caregivers.
 Government Guidance
 But in spite of the planning, preparation and emotions, the decisions will solely lie in the hands of state lawmakers, and in cooperation with school administrators.
 In New York State, over 20 pages of guidance released on July 13 are to be used as a guideline by administrators.
 These guidelines include recommendations on the reopening of school facilities for in-person instruction, monitoring of health conditions, containment of potential transmission of the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19), and the closure of school facilities and in-person instruction, if necessitated by widespread virus transmission.
 Included, as core health and safety measures for New York schools are face coverings, social distancing, and a reduction of social density. Parents and caregivers are also being encouraged to provide their own transportation, where possible. Hygiene and contact tracing, among other requirements, are also to be set in place for in-school instruction.
 Plans are due to the governor by July 31 in New York, and a decision on education will be rendered in the beginning of August out of Albany. At that time, schools will begin to move forward with their plans.
 In Pennsylvania, the latest guidance announced earlier this month requires students and staff to wear face coverings at school and on the bus with some exceptions, such as if they are unable to due to a medical condition, need to communicate with someone who is hard of hearing, is unable to remove a mask without assistance, or if wearing a mask proves hazardous for what they have to do. Students can remove face coverings while eating or drinking.
 State officials also encouraged social distancing as much as possible, from spacing desks 6-feet apart and making sure they face the same direction to holding classes in large spaces such as gymnasiums, auditoriums, and outdoors.
 The state also suggested staggered class times, one-way walking patterns in hallways, limiting the amount of students on the playgrounds at one time, spacing out children in the cafeteria or serving pre-packaged meals in the classrooms, and holding virtual gatherings and activities as much as possible.
 With sports, coaches, athletes and spectators must wear masks unless they can maintain 6 feet of separation, are working out, or are involved in competition.
 Moving Ahead
 Building on these guidelines, Pennsylvania school districts, charter schools and technical centers are required to develop and adopt a health and safety plan before they can welcome students and staff back to campus. The state strongly encourages private schools to do the same.
 Schools are slated to open earlier in Pennsylvania, with Blue Ridge School District students set to return on Aug. 26, Susquehanna schools and Towanda Area School District set for re-opening on Aug. 25, and the Athens Area School District ready to welcome students on Aug. 27, for example.
 In New York, schools are set to open after Labor Day; all dependent on decisions, once again, made out of Albany.

In 2019, the Ravens compensated for some of their defensive weaknesses up front with scheme. They were the NFL’s heaviest-blitzing team by a wide margin. You can still expect ultra-aggressive play-calling, but it won’t be as necessary — Baltimore significantly upgraded its defensive line with the additions of Derek Wolfe and the age-defying Calais Campbell.
 Justin Madubuike was also a steal in the third-round of the draft. He provides much-needed explosiveness in the interior and will allow the Ravens to generate pressure with more even-man fronts without having to blitz — something they struggled to do last season. Throw in first-round draft pick and projected Day 1 starter, linebacker Patrick Queen, and this is a top-five defense on paper.
 Strength of schedule usually gets completely overblown by pundits. Looking at prior year records to determine NFL schedule difficulty is an exercise in futility. That said, travel logistics in this particular season with so much uncertainty surrounding coronavirus could have a critical impact.
 Fortunately for the Ravens, they have one of the friendliest road schedules imaginable. Just take a look at the cities they’ll travel to in 2020:

According to Scobie and Durand, "Back when Meghan and Harry were dating, William, having met Meghan only a handful of times, wanted to make sure the American actress had the right intentions. 'After all, these are two brothers that have spent their whole lives with people trying to take advantage of them,' the source said." As a result, William was seemingly much more cautious than his brother: "as William didn't know a whole lot about Meghan, he wanted to make sure Harry wasn't blindsided by lust."
 The publication also alleged, "Some members of staff were whispering words of alarm into the Duke of Cambridge's ear," which is why the future king decided to speak seriously to his brother. "'Don't feel you need to rush this,' William told Harry, according to sources. 'Take as much time as you need to get to know this girl.'" Unfortunately, William's unfortunate phrasing, in calling Meghan "this girl," didn't sit well with Harry.
 Per _Finding Freedom_ , "Harry heard the tone of snobbishness that was anathema to his approach to the world. During his 10-year career in the military, outside the royal bubble, he had learnt not to make snap judgments about people based on their accent, education, ethnicity, class or profession." This was coupled with Harry's desire to break free from being the younger brother. "There was a thin line between caring and condescending," Scobie and Durand stated. "Just because he went about his life differently from his brother didn't make it wrong."
 A source also revealed to the authors, "Harry was pissed off... Pissed off that his brother would ask such a thing. Some felt it was an overreaction. But then, this sums them up as people--William, the calm and rational one, and Harry, who can't help but take things far too personally." Another source elaborated, "Harry could see through William's words. He was being a snob."

Before flat TVs came along, the most important factor limiting the mass adoption of big screens wasn't desire -- we've always hungered for a huge, immersive, theatrical picture in our living rooms. It was technology. CRT- based TVs maxed out at 40 inches so if you wanted a bigger screen your only choice was a technology that died eight years ago: rear-projection.
 Back in the day you could buy a rear-projection TV that was 65 inches or even larger, but it took up a huge chunk of space and cost a relative fortune. A good example was the Samsung HL-S5687 I reviewed for CNET in 2006. This 56-inch TV cost $2,700 at the time and I called it "a top choice for people who want a 1080p big screen but don't want to break the bank." Yep, nearly three grand for a 56-inch TV was a good value 15 years ago. In fact I told my future father-in-law to buy that same TV and he used it for 12 years before upgrading to an LG OLED.
 And that RPTV _was_ a good deal, at least compared to flat-panel TVs at the time. In 2005 CNET reviewed one of the first LCD-based TVs, the Sony KDL- VXBR1. It measured 40 inches in size and cost a whopping $4,000. In succeeding years flat-panel TVs became cheaper to produce and prices quickly fell, helped by models such as the Vizio P50HD, a 50-inch plasma TV that cost "just" $2,000 -- a tremendous bargain in 2006. It took another few years for larger flat- panel TVs to get affordable, however.

SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korean leader Kim Jong Un placed the city of Kaesong near the border with South Korea under total lockdown after a person was found there with suspected COVID-19 symptoms, saying “the vicious virus” may have entered the country, state media reported Sunday.If the person is officially declared a coronavirus patient, he or she would be North Korea's first confirmed case. The North has steadfastly said it has had no cases of the virus, a claim questioned by outside experts.The lockdown was declared Friday afternoon. The North's official Korean Central News Agency said the suspected virus patient is a runaway who fled to South Korea three years ago before illegally crossing the border into the North early last week.KCNA said respiratory secretion and blood tests showed the person "is suspected to have been infected" with the coronavirus. It said the person was placed under quarantine. People who had been in contact with the suspected patient and those who had been to Kaesong in the last five days were also quarantined.Describing its anti-virus efforts as a "matter of national existence," North Korea earlier this year shut down nearly all cross-border traffic, banned foreign tourists and mobilized health workers to quarantine anyone with symptoms. But the Kaesong lockdown is the first such known measure taken in a North Korean city to stem the pandemic.Foreign experts say a coronavirus outbreak in North Korea could cause dire consequences because of its fragile public health care infrastructure and chronic lack of medical supplies. They are also skeptical about North Korea's claim of having had no infections because the country shares a long, porous border with China, its biggest trading partner, where the world's first known virus cases were reported in December.Kaesong, a city with an estimated population of 200,000, is located just north of the heavily fortified land border with South Korea. It once hosted the Koreas' jointly run industrial complex, which has been shut since 2016 amid nuclear tensions. Last month, North Korea blew up an inter- Korean liaison office in Kaesong to protest a campaign by South Korean activists who have been sending anti-Pyongyang leaflets across the border.During an emergency Politburo meeting Saturday, Kim also declared a state of emergency in the Kaesong area and "clarified the determination of the Party Central Committee to shift from the state emergency anti-epidemic system to the maximum emergency system and issue a top-class alert," KCNA said.It quoted Kim as saying there was "a critical situation in which the vicious virus could be said to have entered the country." Kim said he took "the preemptive measure of totally blocking Kaesong City and isolating each district and region from the other" on Friday afternoon after receiving the report on it, according to KCNA.Analyst Cheong Seong-Chang at the private Sejong Institute in South Korea said a thorough lockdown in Kaesong would make it difficult for a potential virus outbreak to spread beyond the city. But he said virus fears would engulf North Korean leaders."The anxiety and fears about COVID-19 spreading in the North Korean leadership would be much bigger than outsiders can roughly speculate because the country lacks test kits and has virtually no facilities to treat virus patients," Cheong said.The Politburo meeting also discussed the "loose guard performance" at the border area where the suspected patient crossed over to North Korea, KCNA said.It said that Kim and other leaders were briefed on the results of an intensive investigation of a military unit responsible for the border crossing and discussed administering "a severe punishment."More than 33,000 North Koreans have fled to South Korea over the past 20 years to avoid poverty and political suppression, mostly via China. But it is highly unusual for North Korean refugees to return to their impoverished, authoritarian homeland by crossing the mine-strewn inter-Korean border.South Korea's military said later Sunday that its investigation into who crossed the border into North Korea was being narrowed down to a single, unidentified person. A military statement said authorities were examining footage recorded by front-line surveillance equipment, but it gave no further details. Some observers said authorities likely tried to determine who has been missing since last week among North Korean refugees in South Korea, especially among those originally from Kaesong."Blaming an alleged return defector for bringing COVID-19 into the country is likely intended to shift blame for spread of the virus away from China and Pyongyang and on to Seoul," said Leif-Eric Easley, a professor at Ewha University in Seoul."This may also be a tactic for ratcheting up diplomatic pressure on (South Korea) and trying to further dissuade North Koreans from defecting to the South," he said.Cheong, however, said it was unlikely that the North’s claim of the person crossing the border was false because it couldn’t punish its own military unit with a fabricated announcement. He said North Korea was unlikely to resume dialogue and exchanges with South Korea until it is confident about containing a possible virus outbreak.Copyright 2020 Associated Press.

We currently live in an era when news media is seen to be insanely biased at times and at others at least factually biased since in many ways it depends on who funds the source, what kind of news they choose to report, and what their overall agenda is. Inside Edition might benefit from a crash course on what goes on in hotels since to be fair, a lot of hotel rooms only receive a light turn now and again if numbers are down and fewer guests are seen to frequent the rooms. This is perhaps one of the few things that really bothers me concerning this episode as having worked in a few different hotels, there is typically little to no need to do more than a light turn, if anything, for a room that is not occupied. There is also the idea that Inside Edition could be pulling a bait and switch on the audience, but this is a serious accusation in light of the pandemic and what it would mean to a hotel's reputation should they decline to clean a room from top to bottom. Often, housekeeping will cover a room from every angle, change the sheets, the pillowcases, the bedding if needs be, and wipe everything thoroughly before moving on to the next room. This is standard for many hotels but unfortunately, not all hotels are possessed of the same quality standards.

One major problem is that people don't know what to believe at this time thanks to increased media bias when it comes to their reporting techniques. Let's be fair and realistic, a lot of hotels have a bad reputation when it comes to cleanliness that they're given before anyone bothers to check the validity of such a claim. Staying in hotels is an uncomfortable proposition for many people since they don't want to think of who slept in a bed before them, or touched anything before them, especially with the continuation of COVID-19. But the paranoia spread by the news media in cases such as this means a possibility of fewer guests, a damaged reputation, and far less income for those hotels that are affected by these stories. It is true, hotels that are lax in their cleaning practices are in fact risking the health of their guests and should be called out in accordance with the necessary cleaning protocols that are needed to ensure that every last guest is given a room that has been cleaned from top to bottom and is perfectly safe for a night or two. With any stay longer than a night it feels as though a hotel should offer a mandatory turndown service that will ensure that the room will be wiped down and that the sheets will be changed. It is a bit of an added hardship for hotel employees that might already be overworked if their establishment is in fact still accepting guests, but it is necessary to keep people safe.
