U.S. equities markets were poised for a rebound on Friday after Thursday's coronavirus pandemic-fueled bloodbath marked the worst declines in indices across the board since the Black Monday meltdown in October 1987. Dow futures were up more than 1,000 points in the pre-market session. The wild swings of the Dow, S&P 500 and NASDAQ markets [...]

"I was really looking forward to going for it, definitely," Barrett said. "It's a pretty big deal, so I hate it that I don't get to try to win all three. It's crazy times, but I think you have to err on the side of safety for everybody.
 "I'm training now for the Indy Mini (13.1 miles) in May if it gets to happen, which I'm starting to doubt."
 Barrett's surge has him taking aim at major aspirations. At last November's Monumental Marathon (26.2 miles) in Indianapolis, he ran it in 2 hours, 24 minutes, 31 seconds to finish 27th overall and come up just 5 minutes shy of meeting the cutoff time for the U.S. Olympic Trials.
 That encouraging race has him preparing to make a great run at the Trials in 2024.
 "Yeah, that is a definite goal," Barrett said. "I may be coming into it now, but as the years go on my lower-distance capabilities will start to diminish as those fast-twice fibers start to fade into slow-twitch fibers.
 "So the marathon distance is probably the most realistic for me to go after these kinds of goals. I know 2024 is a long way off, but I'm going to follow my training and go after it. There are 250 runners who qualify for the Olympic Trials in the marathon, so I'm going to try to be one of those 250 (the top three make the U.S. team).
 "I was only five minutes off the mark in Indy, so I'm in the range of doing it. I felt pretty good and was right on pace at 20 miles, and then I just hit the wall the last six and I can't even describe what it was like, so I have to get through that.
 "But I'm back into it, and it's going as well as it ever has for me. Right after college, I don't think I had burnout, but I just wanted to relax for a while, so I didn't train real hard. But it has come back around and gained momentum.
 "I've shown some spark here, and if you're good at something and doing well, why would you ever want to stop?"
 Logan Barrett will always be burning up the roads whether's he's competing against 4,000 runners in Louisville, 20,000 in Indianapolis, 249 at the Olympic Trials, or against himself on a lonely lane in Lawrence County.
 "I truly love running," Barrett said. "The act itself is just the best for all it does for you, and it's not just race day, but any day. You meet a lot of cool people and make so many great memories along the way.
 "It holds my life together, to be honest."

Once again, as we weather the weekend during which we go on Daylight Saving Time (DST) we are once more embroiled in the debate of permanent standard time versus permanent Daylight Saving Time ("Which to choose?" The Intelligencer, March 3).
   
 The passage and resultant implementation of either bill advocating a permanent standard time or permanent Daylight Saving Time is impractical.
   
 The use of permanent standard time would deprive people of that extra hour of daylight at the end of the day during summer, while permanent DST would not be practical during the winter months when days are shorter anyway.
   
 DST should be utilized not in its present form but from the last full weekend of April to the final full weekend in October -- when it serves a purpose.
