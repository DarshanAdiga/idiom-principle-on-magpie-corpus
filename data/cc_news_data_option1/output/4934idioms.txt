A pickup driver’s drug use was the reason he crashed last year into an oncoming group of motorcyclists in New Hampshire, leading to the death of seven bikers, the National Transportation Safety Board found Tuesday. The board unanimously approved a report that determined that Volodymyr Zhukovskyy's impairment from the drugs was the “probable cause\" for him crossing the center line on a rural, two-lane highway and sparking the fiery crash. Zhukovskyy was returning from delivering vehicles for a Massachusetts transport company and was towing an empty flatbed trailer. NTSB investigators told the board that Zhukovskyy had drugs, including opioids, in his system. They also said witnesses had reported him driving erratically. “Very sadly, the circumstances of this crash underscore the rising concern regarding the impact of multi-substance impairment on transportation safety,” NTSB member Thomas Chapman said during the virtual hearing. “Our own research in this area indicates the instances of drug-impaired driving is increasing at even greater rates than alcohol-impaired driving.” Investigators ruled out cellphone use or weather as a factor. They couldn’t rule out that fatigue played a role but concluded its effects were unclear because of the drug use. The crash happened June 21, 2019, in Randolph. The seven bikers were members of the Jarheads Motorcycle Club, a New England group that includes Marines and their spouses. The victims were from New Hampshire, Massachusetts and Rhode Island. Zhukovskyy, of West Springfield, Massachusetts, pleaded not guilty to negligent homicide and driving under the influence. He remains in custody as he awaits trial next year.

Four players tested positive last week and another seven are in quarantine because of contact tracing. Those absences put USC under the minimum number of scholarship players established by the Pac-12, leading to its first cancellation of the abbreviated season.
 All available players tested negative Tuesday, which allowed USC to resume team activities. Another round of negative tests Wednesday will lead to a return to practice in full pads, Helton said.
 As long as there are no further positive tests Helton expects to have enough players available to host the Cougars, who have not played since Nov. 14 because of their own issues with player availability caused by the coronavirus.
 Helton does not know how many of those 11 players will be cleared to return but “it’s an adequate enough number to be able to play ball,” he said.

Baird added that he knows MHSAA executive director Mark Uyl well from Uyl's time in charge of wrestling and cross-country. Uyl has his own children that play sports, including a senior athlete, Grant, at DeWitt.
 "He knows that we all want seasons," Baird said.
 Baird, of course, has his own senior son, Mack, who ran for the Panthers' cross team this year and is in line for a senior wrestling season. Mack has twice been an all-state wrestler and would certainly love to have a shot at accomplishing that feat a third time.
 However, that senior season has already been cut short by the pandemic in more ways than one. Even before the latest sports shutdown, wrestling was slated to be affected more than most sports, as you'd expect given its obvious potential for virus transmission. High school teams are set to be limited to one competition a week, which can be, at maximum, a quad. That is far different than wrestling's normal schedule, which often consists of a quad as well as a large weekend tournament most weeks.
 Prior to the shutdown, the MHSAA hadn't gone as far as to discuss how these limitations would affect a potential individual state tournament, which consist of far more than four schools sending their wrestlers to district and regional meets throughout the state.
 "We might have five or eight-week seasons," Baird said. "That's just what I'm thinking. I think they want to give as many kids their chances to enjoy their senior years as possible. The more precautions we take as a West Michigan community, the more chances our kids will have in education and educational athletics."
 In the meantime, Baird is also trying to keep his athletes ready to go. Certainly physical conditioning is key in the sport, but as young high schoolers see more and more opportunities go by the boards, staying strong mentally is just as important.
 "I've been in education a long time, and coaching since 1989," Baird said. "We're all at a heightened anxiousness.
 "That's one of our biggest challenges, is to keep people comfortable. It's different. I try to tell my son the same thing. It's going to be different, but we're certainly hoping that all the hard work we've put in, we can show (the results). If it doesn't happen, the idea on the other side is that the kids learned a lot of lessons from all of this."
 Baird has already weighed the possibility of changing the way he prepares his wrestlers if a season gets going in January. With each wrestler likely to take the mat far fewer times than they normally would, the coach said training might be more of a point of emphasis as opposed to the sparring that often comprises a wrestling practice.
 "(Assistant coach Mark Arbogast) and I have talked about changing up how we do things," Baird said. "Maybe a little less grind and a little more training. There will be a lot less matches. The hard training we've done in the past, we may have to sacrifice some of that to have a season and let the kids' talents take over from there."
 As a coach and a dad, Baird badly wants a season to take place. Many of the wrestlers already lost their spring sports earlier this year, and Baird knows his team badly wants to compete.
 "I'd be deeply hurt if the kids weren't able to compete," Baird said. "I want all the kids to have a great experience. I hope the kids hang tough and try to see the season through with as much positivity as possible."
 In another uncertain period, speculation has reigned over what may come of the winter sports seasons. Like Baird, Rosema said any way a season can take place is a way his team will support.
 "I'm all for having a season, no matter any way we can fit it in," Rosema said. "If it goes into March and April, that would be great. I understand they have to get spring sports in. If we get 10 or 15 games and jump into the tournament, that's fine by me. I just want the girls to have a chance to play."

Stemming from litigation dating back to 2008, the City of Calistoga is confronted again with a long-standing threat from an environmental group over the operation of Kimball Dam.
 Grant Reynolds, a director of Water Audit California, delivered a letter to the City of Calistoga on Monday criticizing the city for not fulfilling its commitment to complete a “stream study … and other aspects of its commitments.”
 According to the letter, the City adopted an interim bypass plan in 2011, with the intention of meeting demands and ending the litigation.
 Since then, “From Water Audit’s extensive review of documents produced in reply to a public records request, from our review of other public records, and from our inquiries to the regulatory agencies, it appears that nearly a decade later Calistoga still has not completed the promised stream study. Other aspects of its commitments under the Plan are apparently also incomplete,” the letter states.

 The Niners have experience spending one week on the road, having done it between games back East the past two seasons. They won the second game on both of those trips.
 This version won’t have any of the usual bonding time for players as COVID-19 protocols limit how much time players can have contact with each other. Shanahan said a 30-minute meal after a win at New Orleans last month led to positive tests.
 But with the Niners (5-6) only one game out of a playoff spot, the team has plenty of reason to rally together and make a late-season push.

Indiana Pacers All-Star guard Victor Oladipo moved Tuesday to squash rumors that he has been seeking to depart the organization, although he stopped short of saying he wants to stay beyond his current deal.
 Oladipo has played just 55 games over the past two seasons because of a ruptured quad tendon. He saw action in just 19 regular-season games and four playoff games in the interrupted 2019-20 season.
 Rumors persisted that Oladipo was interested in an opportunity outside of the state. He also went to college at Indiana and was the No. 2 overall draft pick by the Orlando Magic in 2013. He signed with the Oklahoma City Thunder in 2016 and was traded to the Pacers in 2017.
 "Growing up, I was always taught to not engage in nonsense," Oladipo said Tuesday about persistent rumors that he wants out of his current situation.
 "I never said I didn't want to play for the Pacers. I love the coaching staff. I'm looking forward to the season. I can't control what others say. I'm focused on my team, this city and this organization."
 The 28-year old had a breakout season in 2017-18, his first year with the Pacers, when he averaged 23.1 points per game, 4.3 assists and an NBA-best 2.4 steals. He made the All-Star team for the first time.
 In January 2019, during a game against the Toronto Raptors, he ruptured his quad tendon where it connects with his right knee. He still was named an All- Star reserve but did not see action in a game again until Jan. 29 of this year.
 Now, as he enters the final season the four-year, $84 million deal he signed with the Thunder, there are questions about his future in Indiana.
 "At the end of the day, that's pretty much out of my control," Oladipo said. "I'm committed to now. To say I don't want to be here is crazy. This is Indiana basketball. But I'm just focused on this year."
 The Pacers fell to the Miami Heat in the first round of the playoffs, but Oladipo sees reasons for optimism. He also says he is even stronger following his injury than he was this summer when the season resumed.
 "It's a different kind of feel around here; a lot of excitement," he said. "We get an opportunity to be full throttle, God willing. We have an opportunity to do something really special here."
 In six career seasons, Oladipo has averaged 17.3 points, 3.9 assists and 1.7 steals over 421 games (361 starts).

SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — New clues have surfaced in the disappearance of a gleaming monolith in Utah that seemed to melt away as mysteriously as it appeared in the red-rock desert — though it's no longer the only place where a strange structure has been discovered.

LOS ANGELES (AP) — Time was not on Southern California’s side last week as positive tests for COVID-19 and contact tracing led to the cancellation of its game against Colorado. An extra day this week might be just enough for the Trojans to return to competition. No. 17 USC (3-0) resumed conditioning workouts Tuesday as coach Clay Helton expressed cautious optimism they will be able to play Washington State (1-1) on Sunday. “By moving the game from Friday to Sunday, it allows us to garner the adequate number of players that we need at a certain position to be able to play this game,” Helton said. Four players tested positive last week and another seven are in quarantine because of contact tracing. Those absences put USC under the minimum number of scholarship players established by the Pac-12, leading to its first cancellation of the abbreviated season. All available players tested negative Tuesday, which allowed USC to resume team activities. Another round of negative tests Wednesday will lead to a return to practice in full pads, Helton said. As long as there are no further positive tests Helton expects to have enough players available to host the Cougars, who have not played since Nov. 14 because of their own issues with player availability caused by the coronavirus. Helton does not know how many of those 11 players will be cleared to return but “it’s an adequate enough number to be able to play ball,” he said. Helton said practices will have to be adjusted to make up for the team’s limited numbers. There aren’t enough players to be on the scout team, so he expects the starting offense and defense to work together to simulate what Washington State does. There will be more walkthrough periods despite the need for live reps, as seven of the previous...

A federal magistrate judge in April 2019 threw out Spanier’s conviction a day before he was to turn himself in to begin serving a jail sentence of two months, followed by two months of house arrest. The judge gave prosecutors three months to retry Spanier, but that has been on hold during the appeal.
 U.S. Magistrate Judge Karoline Mehalchick in Scranton, Pennsylvania, had agreed with Spanier that he had been improperly charged under a 2007 law for allegations that dated to 2001.
 Prosecutors had argued the 1995 and 2007 versions of the law encompassed and criminalized the same conduct.
 U.S. Circuit Judge Mike Fisher, joined by two others, wrote in the opinion released Tuesday that  Spanier’s due process rights would only be violated if the state Superior Court’s ruling against him that upheld his conviction had been an “‘unexpected and indefensible’ interpretation of the child endangerment statute in light of prior law.”
