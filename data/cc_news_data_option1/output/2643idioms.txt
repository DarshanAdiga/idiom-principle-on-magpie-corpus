Days after airing her discontent over the management of Covid-19 pandemic by the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) government, the Telangana Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan is scheduled to meet the representatives of the private hospitals amid a standoff with the government. The TRS government headed by chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao is at loggerheads with the private healthcare providers pertaining to tests and even ordered closure of over a dozen private labs, accusing them responsible for high positivity rates. This comes days after the Centre raising red flags over ‘high positivity and low testing’ scenario in Telangana and sending a high- level committee of health ministry to visit Hyderabad. Late Monday evening, the Telangana governor tweeted about her meeting with the private healthcare providers for successful private-public participation in Coronavirus eradication, apart from summoning the chief secretary and health secretary to discuss prevailing Covid situation. This comes days after her visit to government hospitals in Hyderabad treating Covid-19 patients and accusing the TRS government of lukewarm response to her letters on the pandemic. Dr Tamilisai, who is also a medical doctor, said she “will be interacting with private hospitals with Covid isolation facilities tomorrow 11am regarding Covid management & public grievances for redressal from them on beds, billings, testing etc for successful pvt-public participation in #corona eradication successfully & cordially.” At a time when the state government did not announce for days holding any meetings of the chief minister with the top bureaucrats to monitor the Covid-19 pandemic spread despite a sharp spike in cases, the governor tweeted summoning the chief secretary and health secretary to discuss on the Covid-19 situation prevailing across Telangana. Of late, the local and national leadership of BJP and the ruling TRS have been engaged in a blame game over the spread of Covid-19 pandemic in Telangana. While the BJP leadership has stepped up its attack on the ruling TRS holding poor health infrastructure and low tests responsible for rising Covid-19 cases and deaths, TRS countered it by accusing the Centre of diverting to other states the testing machines Telangana had ordered. On Monday, the Telangana BJP president Bandi Sanjay accused the TRS government of miserably failing in increasing the tests and improving the healthcare infrastructure even when the state was witnessing a sharp spike in Covid-19 cases. Condemning the arrests of certain journalists with false cases for exposing the shortcomings of the Telangana government, the BJP president demanded slapping cases against the chief minister Rao and his cabinet colleagues for misleading the public on the preparedness to tackle Coronavirus.
