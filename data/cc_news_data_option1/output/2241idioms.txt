"I am delighted that someone of the stature and incredible batting record of Younis Khan has agreed to join the Pakistan cricket set-up as national men's team batting coach," PCB Chief Executive Wasim Khan said."Younis' work ethics, commitment to match preparation, game awareness and tactics in the English conditions will be invaluable. He is a role model to a number of current players and is hugely respected. I have no doubt that the squad will benefit from the immense value that he will bring, both on and off the field."Former leg-spinner Mushtaq Ahmed, who took 185 wickets in 52 Tests for Pakistan, will also be mentor of side. He has guided both England and the West Indies in the past as spin bowling coach."Mushtaq knows the English conditions as well as anyone, having spent a lot of time playing county cricket and working with the England cricket team," said Wasim."Apart from guiding the spinners and playing a mentor's role, Mushtaq can be helpful to Misbah in match planning and preparations."It is crucial that the side understands the conditions that they will encounter in the upcoming series and so having the experience of the likes of Younis Khan and Mushtaq Ahmed to compliment head coach Misbah-ul-Haq and fast bowling coach Waqar Younis will be invaluable."Younis said he feels "privileged to have been again offered the opportunity to serve Pakistan for a challenging but exciting tour of England.""The Pakistan side includes some immensely talented cricketers who have the potential to achieve greater heights. Together with Misbah-ul-Haq, Mushtaq Ahmed and Waqar Younis, we will try to make them better and prepare them as best as we can with on and off field coaching and guidance," Younis said in a PCB release."This particular tour provides me with an ideal opportunity where I can spend post-training time with the players to engage with them on batting techniques, bowler assessments, mental toughness exercises besides talking them through with scenario planning," said Younis, who scored 810 runs in nine Tests against England."We all know English conditions demand not only precise technique but patience and discipline, and if you can master these, then you will not only excel in England but anywhere in the world."Head coach and chief selector Misbah-ul-Haq also welcomed Younis and Mushtaq on the coaching panel."Due to events beyond human control, the series in England will be one of the most challenging and difficult and, as such, we need to have the best talent and brains on our side. Younis as well as Mushtaq clearly tick all these and additional boxes, which will assist us in achieving our targets," he said.",

"This is a huge step forward in cricket and in sports in general as we travel over to England for this series," said Holder."A lot has gone into the preparations for what will be a new phase in the game."But rather than matches before crowds at The Oval, Edgbaston and Lord's, a now back-to-back series will take place behind closed doors at the more 'bio-secure' Ageas Bowl and Old Trafford.Whereas players usually spend evenings during a Test away from the ground, they will now instead find themselves in a protective bubble at two venues which both have onsite hotels.Southampton's Ageas Bowl will stage the series opener from July 8, with the next two Tests at Old Trafford.All the West Indies players have tested negative for the virus, although they will be retested when they arrive in Manchester.Health measures, including a ban on applying saliva to the ball set to be rubber-stamped at an International Cricket Council meeting on Wednesday, will be in place."Our main objective is to deliver a safe environment for all stakeholders," said England and Wales Cricket Board events director Steve Elworthy.'Done us a favour'Yet there is no escaping the financial impact of the virus.Going ahead with major matches is seen as vital, with the ECB estimating it could lose 252 million ($316 million) if there are no fixtures at all this summer.One of cricket's poorest major teams in the West Indies is now helping one of its wealthiest, despite the Caribbean outfit's cricket board having to impose a 50-percent pay cut on all players and staff.The West Indies, who hold the Wisden Trophy after beating England at home last year, have selected a 25-strong squad.They will complete a 14-day quarantine period combined with initial training at Old Trafford before heading south from Manchester for the first Test.Despite the ECB's efforts, three West Indies players -- Darren Bravo, Shimron Hetmyer and Keemo Paul -- declined to tour, with Cricket West Indies insisting it will not hold this against them when it comes to future selection.Bravo and Hetmyer's absence deprives the tourists of two top-order batsman, with Paul less of a loss given he is a back-up for Holder, the world's top-ranked allrounder.Former interim head coach Floyd Reifer will fill in as batting coach for Monty Desai, who is based in India and cannot join the tour due to travel restrictions."There is expectation in the air that we will defend the Wisden Trophy and we will certainly put in the work and give it our all to keep hold of it," insisted Holder.But it could be Root who is the most significant absentee from the first Test.Root's wife is expected to give birth to the couple's second child in the first week of July.That may mean Root has to then self-isolate for seven days, putting a question mark against his participation at Southampton.Root has backed vice-captain Ben Stokes to do a good job in his absence but Kevin Pietersen, recalling his own brief stint as England skipper, was wary of adding to the star all-rounder's burdens and suggested wicketkeeper Jos Buttler for the role instead."The entertainers and the guys that have to carry the mantle in the team sometimes aren't the best captains and sometimes struggle with the extra added pressure," Pietersen told talkSPORT.",

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump and his allies have seized on calls to “defund the police” as a dangerous example of Democratic overreach as he fights for momentum amid crises that threaten his reelection.Key Democrats, including presumptive presidential nominee Joe Biden, are distancing themselves from the "defund" push, which some supporters say is a symbolic commitment to end systemic racism and shift policing priorities rather than an actual plan to eliminate law enforcement agencies. But confusion over the proposal's intent has created an opportunity for the Republican president, who has struggled to navigate the delicate debate over racial justice, risking support from people of color, suburban women and independents less than five months before Election Day. Facing increasing pressure to weigh in, Biden addressed the issue Monday in an interview with "CBS Evening News." "I don't support defunding the police. I support conditioning federal aid to police based on whether or not they meet certain basic standards of decency, honorableness and, in fact, are able to demonstrate they can protect the community, everybody in the community," Biden said. Other opponents of the movement include Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., a former presidential candidate and one of two black Democratic senators, and Rep. Karen Bass, D-Calif., head of the Congressional Black Caucus.NAACP President Derrick Johnson, in an interview, also declined to endorse calls to defund the police."I support the energy behind it. I don't know what that substantively means. As I'm talking to people about the concept, I've gotten three different explanations," said Johnson, who has criticized Trump. "We know there has to be a change in the culture of policing in this country."Democrats are well-positioned to win over the political center this fall, according to Republican pollster Frank Luntz, who said Trump's uneven actions and rhetoric at a time of sweeping social unrest are "killing him."Luntz added, however, that Democrats risk their advantage by embracing policies viewed as radical following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. The handcuffed black man died after a white officer pressed his knee into Floyd's neck for more than eight minutes.Municipal officials in Minneapolis have endorsed the "defund the police" language backed by some civil rights activists and a handful of progressive House Democrats. Protesters over the weekend also painted "DEFUND THE POLICE" in large yellow letters on a street close to the White House. But there was little evidence that the effort was gaining momentum in Congress. Some Democrats described it as bad politics, even if most Democrats shared the desire to overhaul policing.Former Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, D-N.D., a white moderate who lost her 2018 reelection bid, said "defund the police" is "a horrible name" that misconstrues the goal."By starting with the word 'defund,' you've left the impression that you are doing something much more radical than what needs to be done," said Heitkamp, a leader of the One Country Project, which is trying to help Democrats connect better with rural voters.She said the term left her frustrated that "there's going to be somebody who's going to try to find an opportunity in this, especially among the Republican Party, and use it now as an excuse not to address what is a very real problem in America."That's largely what played out as the Trump campaign and congressional Republicans sought to link Democrats to the defund effort."This year has seen the lowest crime numbers in our Country's recorded history, and now the Radical Left Democrats want to Defund and Abandon our Police," Trump declared on social media. "Sorry, I want LAW &amp; ORDER!" The House GOP campaign arm sent out emails condemning "defund the police" and connecting it to Democratic candidates."No industry is safe from Democrats' abolish culture," said Michael McAdams, a spokesman for the National Republican Congressional Committee. "First they wanted to abolish private health insurance, then it was capitalism and now it's the police. What's next, the fire department?"Democrats on Capitol Hill unveiled a sweeping proposal Monday to address police brutality that did not include plans to strip funding from the police. The Justice in Policing Act would limit legal protections for police, create a national database of excessive- force incidents and ban chokeholds, among other changes.Rep. Greg Meeks, a member of the Congressional Black Caucus and a group of moderate House Democrats called the New Democrat Coalition, said Trump's tweets accusing Democrats of seeking to abolish the police are a diversion."It sounds like the guy that's the 45th president is trying to distract from what the real issue is, the brutality and the murder of George Floyd," said Meeks, who represents New York. "And we're not going to allow them to do that."Democratic Rep. Matt Cartwright, who is white and represents a Trump-leaning district in northeastern Pennsylvania, rejected calls to defund the police outright."I don't care how it's named, I'm not for that," he said, while noting he's joined protest marches in his district.Asked if GOP use of the term "defund the police" might erode his support, Cartwright said, "If they can get voters to believe that lie about me, I suppose. Am I afraid of it? No."Trump, meanwhile, is grasping for a strategy that might generate some momentum. A NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll this weekend found that 80% of Americans believe the country is out of control.Some Trump advisers have considered having the president deliver an address on police-community relations and racial injustice, while others believe it would do little good, according to two White House officials and Republicans close to the White House. They also discussed creating a task force featuring Housing Secretary Ben Carson, the only black member of Trump's Cabinet, but that has yet to get off the ground.The people spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations.Before the pandemic, Trump advisers believed the president had a real chance of making inroads with black voters, given his support for criminal justice reform and the strength of the economy. They're less confident now. ___Peoples reported from Montclair, N.J., and Lemire from New York.

CHARLOTTE, N.C. (WBTV) - Heat continues to burn CPI Security after its CEO’s anti-protest comments in an email were made public over the weekend. Big partners have pulled support, ended sponsorships and the CEO voluntarily resigned Monday from the CMPD Police Foundation.The CEO has publicly apologized for his words and Monday was the first day back to work for some of its Black employees.There is no elephant in the room, so to speak. Some of those CPI workers say they are not shying away from talking about it. They also say their CPI administration is on board and supportive of their feelings.It makes sense because Friday, dozens of workers walked out of the office once they found out about the CEO’s emails as a sign of solidarity, and some of them never came back as a sign of their resignation.“The saying is always when a snake shows his head, at least you know where it is,” said Jachin York, who works in sales for CPI.“It’s really about us coming together and holding his feet to the fire,” Jerrien Crops, who is in sales at the security company.York, Crops and Yusuf Baskin all still work at CPI and all said they said they weren’t shocked about what Gill wrote in an email. They were just disappointed.“We’re not willing to gloss this moment over,” said Crops.Gill’s comments were sent to Queen City Unity, an activist group asking big companies for support in the Black Lives Matter movement. In response, Gill wrote, “Please spend your time in a more productive way. I challenge your statistics. A better use of time would, would be to focus on the black on black crime and senseless killing of our young men by other young men.”After the email was made public, the Carolina Panthers, Charlotte Hornets, Charlotte Knights, NC State Athletics, and Gamecock Athletics ended partnerships with the security company.“Before I came to CPI, I did read some reviews on GlassDoor and they talked about a sense of white privilege and everything,” said Baskin.One review WBTV’s Bria Bell found on that website read, “CPD has decent pay,” and “Expect customer abuse to go completely unresolved. Warnings on accounts of racist customers to ‘not send black technicians,’ etc. are not uncommon.”But it’s the comments from the weekend making public waves bigger than any of these employees imagined.“Phones are ringing off the hook. It’s one of those things where we’re getting a lot of overhauls...overflow I should say,” said Crops.All three men say they are not in a position to leave because of bills.“Still have to have a paycheck,” York said.They all agree that a lot of their non-Black coworkers are promising to really listen, empathize, and make changes to the culture so Black employees feel more comfortable while at work.“A conversation that’s going to have to be constructive and going to get somewhere,” Crops added.“Just because the CEO says it, doesn’t necessarily mean everybody in the building feels that way,” said Baskin.With so many customers ending partnerships with CPI. The men say they are concerned about the future of their jobs.Copyright 2020 WBTV. All rights reserved.

A Bergame, l'une des provinces italiennes les plus touchees par l'epidemie de coronavirus, pres de la moitie de la population est susceptible d'avoir ete infectee, a declare mardi le maire de Bergame Giorgio Gori. "Une partie significative de la population, pres de 50%, a deja ete en contact avec le virus", a explique M. Gori lors d'une visioconference avec des journalistes etrangers. Son estimation se base sur les donnees de Oggicomestai.it ('aujourd'hui comment tu vas'), une application de surveillance de la sante pour les residents de la province de Bergame, deja telechargee par environ 50.000 personnes. Environ 35% ont indique avoir ressenti les symptomes typiques du virus, comprenant fievre, toux et perte de gout ou d'odorat, a indique Gori. "Si nous ajoutons a cela la part physiologique de patients asymptomatiques, je pense que nous obtenons une image fiable de l'incidence veritable du coronavirus dans la province de Bergame", a-t-il ajoute. "Nous parlons de 35 a 45%", a estime M. Gori. Lundi, les autorites sanitaires de Bergame ont revele que les tests sanguins effectues sur un echantillon de 10.000 citoyens ont revele que pres de 60% d'entre eux presentaient les anti-corps du virus, ce qui suggere qu'ils ont ete infectes auparavant. M. Gori a explique que ce pourcentage plus eleve etait lie au fait que les tests ont ete effectues principalement sur des personnes ayant ete exposees au Covid-19. Bergame, une province a 50 kilometres au nord-est de Milan, a ete l'epicentre de l'urgence Covid-19 en Italie. Elle compte 1,1 million d'habitants, dont 120.000 pour la seule ville de Bergame. En mars, la situation etait si grave que les crematoriums locaux ne pouvaient plus suivre le rythme des deces.
