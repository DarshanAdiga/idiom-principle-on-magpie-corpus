Still, there are numerous steps that must be taken before winter sports are officially off and running. On Wednesday, the MIAA COVID-19 Task Force met and crafted their recommendations to deliver to the Board of Directors on Friday. If the fall is any indication, the board will adopt most, if not all, of the task force's requirements and even discuss some measures of their own. If the Board of Directors approves a start date for the winter season, individual districts and superintendents can then permit their school's participation in winter sports.

At a highway-side restaurant in the industrial outskirts of Dubai, workers methodically assemble packaged takeout meals of biryani rice, dal and brightly colored chicken curry for people in poverty and desperate to eat.
 It's not a soup kitchen or charity drive, but an ordinary hole-in-the-wall Indian restaurant alongside a busy motorway in Sharjah, one of the seven desert sheikhdoms in the United Arab Emirates.
 When other kitchens close for the night, Biryani Spot springs into action. The cooks collect leftover food and repurpose it into free, hot meals for underpaid or out-of-work migrants, largely from Southeast Asia. Those in need filter through the cramped restaurant at 10 p.m. to receive dinner -- no questions asked.
 "The current situation is you have a lot of jobless people, a lot of people who are struggling here because of their low salary," restaurant co-founder Mohammed Shujath Ali said. "We don't want to waste our food, ... we want to give it to people in need."

BRUSSELS, Nov 19 — The European Union unveiled plans today to transform its electricity system to rely mostly on renewables within a decade and increase its offshore wind energy capacity 25-fold by 2050.
 Renewable sources like wind and solar provide roughly a third of EU electricity today, but the EU says that share will need to expand to about two-thirds by 2030 to put the bloc on track for its plan to become climate neutral by 2050.
 The European Commission said in its offshore renewable energy plan that the EU’s climate change targets required 60 gigawatts (GW) of offshore wind by 2030 and 300GW by 2050, confirming draft plans reported by Reuters.
 That is a five-fold increase by 2030 and a 25-fold increase by 2050 from the bloc’s current offshore wind capacity of 12 GW.
 Projects would be pushed out by individual countries in the 27-nation bloc. The EU document said all seas bordering EU nations — the North Sea, Baltic Sea, Black Sea, Mediterranean and Atlantic — had potential for wind generation.
 The North Sea has led the way, with Germany, the Netherlands and Denmark, among the EU’s main offshore producers.
 The biggest offshore wind producer in Europe is Britain, which has left the EU. Its installed wind capacity of about 10 GW and its expansion plans were not included in the strategy.
 The Commission outlined plans for 40 GW of EU wave and tidal energy by 2050, lower than a draft plan to build 60GW but still a leap from the 13 megawatt (MW) operating today.
 “Our aims are ambitious, but with our vast sea basins and our global industrial leadership, the EU has all that it needs to meet the challenge,” EU climate policy chief Frans Timmermans said.
 Expanding offshore renewable energy will require investment worth nearly €800 billion (RM3.9 trillion) by 2050, mostly from private capital, to build mammoth new wind farms at sea and scale up nascent technology like floating turbines.
 The EU said it would propose rules to better coordinate countries’ power grids at sea and enable offshore bidding zones for wind farms that supply power to multiple countries.
 The Commission said targets could be met by using less than three per cent of EU maritime space, although campaigners say expanding offshore energy should not harm marine habitats.
 “We need clean energy just as much as we need healthy seas,” Sergiy Moroz, European Environmental Bureau senior policy officer said. — Reuters

As small businesses across the UAE shut down this spring due to the coronavirus pandemic, Ali and his wife were getting ready to open up theirs. A former mechanical engineer, Ali long dreamed of running his own restaurant, a place where the migrant workers who power the plastic and fabric factories of Sharjah's dusty Industrial Area 13 could savor familiar Indian, Pakistani and Bengali food at an exceptionally inexpensive price.
 Instead of thwarting his plans, the pandemic-induced economic collapse created an opportunity. Tens of thousands of people working in the shadows of Dubai's economy lost their jobs overnight, as hotels, restaurants and families fired their low-wage service workers in response to the lockdown.
 Unable to draw on state support in a country that links their residency status to their jobs, many turned to charity to survive.
 Over its two months of existence, Biryani Spot has mobilized to meet the area's growing need for food aid. The place serves griddled paratha bread and a range of spiced meat and rice dishes for less than five dirhams (around $1.50) during the day, and for nothing late at night.
 Those cheap or free meals go a long way in the UAE, a nation of some 9 million people with only about 1 million Emiratis. Southeast Asian laborers, taxi drivers, cleaners, cooks and office workers power businesses across the emirates, home to skyscraper-studded Dubai and oil-rich Abu Dhabi. While many have returned home during the pandemic, others remained, hoping to find work to support loved ones back home.
 Taj al-Islam, a 50-year-old Bangladeshi carwash worker, long has struggled to make ends meet, earning about $270 a month, barely enough to feed his five children back home. He said the free takeout helps him stretch his budget a little longer.
 Mohammed Shakeel, a 38-year-old from Pakistan, arrived at night's end to take the remaining meals back to his mosque about 25 kilometers (about 15 miles) away in Dubai. After 19 years as a service manager at a luxury car dealership, he was fired in March when the virus struck. Now he fruitlessly knocks on company doors in search of work, feeling tired and lightheaded without food.
 "In any other country I'd be supported if I lost a job like this, but here there's no help," Shakeel said as he piled up the food parcels.
 So far, Biryani Spot's biggest challenge is getting the word out. The sprawling neighborhood doesn't have much foot traffic. Hidden from the street, the restaurant's small yellow sign is easily missed among rows of ramshackle shops and abandoned buildings.
 Ali promotes the free food through regular posts in Facebook groups for residents. When people don't turn up, he packs dozens of meals and drives them directly to denser areas, taxi stands or offices where he knows cleaners on their night shifts go hungry.
 He described the handouts as a "small contribution" to people in need, something that's built into his faith as a Muslim.
 "We are just a small-scale business, doing our job, like every human does in his own way," Ali said.

Second, leagues should not play games until one week after the New Year. While teams should be able to develop their players and practice between the start of the winter season and the beginning of competition, postponing the start of games will prevent potential cross-contamination between schools during what is expected to be a high period of socialization amongst kids and families during the holiday season. Districts should not prohibit practicing over the holiday break and any maneuver by the Board of Directors to enforce such a policy would be irresponsible and misguided. The Board of Directors, after all, has stated from Day 1 that districts should do what is best for their individual situations.

This has been a tough election year for just about everyone, but no one has had it tougher than those who were responsible for administering the election and processing the ballots.
 Amid a global health pandemic, election workers had to ensure 6 feet of social distancing between voters, make sanitization stations available and ensure voters wore face masks inside polling centers.
 In addition to adapting to changing guidelines due to the pandemic, this year’s November general election saw city and school board races also on the ballots. Those races typically are held in May but were pushed to November this year as the COVID-19 pandemic took hold.
 And on top of all of that, this year saw record turnout of voters at the polls. In fact, voting turnout was the highest for a general election in more than 20 years in Gregg, Smith, Panola, Harrison, Upshur and Rusk counties, according to the Secretary of State’s Office.
 Elections Administrator Kathryn Nealy said 48,161 Gregg County voters cast ballots in the Nov. 3 general election. They represented 66% of the county’s total registered voters. There are 73,027 registered voters in Gregg County.
 “That was a really good turnout for this election,” Nealy told Gregg County commissioners Monday. “People were ready to get to the polls.”
 Typically, about half of voters cast ballots during early voting and half vote on Election Day. However, this year, early votes accounted for about 79% of total ballots cast, Nealy said. Gregg County also saw almost as many people vote by mail as on Election Day, she said.
 Of residents who voted in Gregg County this year, 4,831 people cast absentee ballots; 38,020 people voted in person during early voting; and 5,310 people cast ballots in person on Election Day, according to information provided by Nealy.
 For comparison, in 2016, 41,618 votes were cast, representing 59.97% of voters. In 2016, there were 69,403 registered voters in Gregg County.
 Pct. 3 Commissioner Gary Boyd said it well when he told Nealy “that was a monumental job” that she oversaw. Indeed, it was a tremendous task.
 Those who served during this election deserve credit for their hard work during this historic election. We want to give a huge kudos to Nealy and her team, who oversaw this process in Gregg County with ease and grace, providing voters a smooth election.

 This is consequent to large swathe of land remaining unutilised for more than two decades after which it changes hands to a third party for a far higher rate.
 In recent years, the land acquisition that takes place ostensibly for industrial development is followed by an assurance given in writing that the individuals who sell their land will be provided a job once the factory is established.

Farmers in the region will seek restoration of land acquired from them if it is not utilised for the original purpose within 5 years of acquisition.
 This is consequent to large swathe of land remaining unutilised for more than two decades after which it changes hands to a third party for a far higher rate.
 In recent years, the land acquisition that takes place ostensibly for industrial development is followed by an assurance given in writing that the individuals who sell their land will be provided a job once the factory is established.
 But in most cases either the factory does not materialise or there is a change of land use from industrial to non-industrial purpose paving way for new housing colonies, choultries, educational institutions etc. As a result farmers feel cheated on two counts: the land acquired from them is resold for higher rate and they are also deprived of a job due to the change in land use pattern from industrial to non-industrial purpose.
 Though the State government introduced a law to lease the land for 99 years instead of outright sale to prevent such conversions, it was withdrawn.
 Badagalpura Nagendra of the Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha (KRRS) pointed out that scores of farmers in Kochanahalli near Nanjangud were promised land in addition to compensation paid for land acquisition. This was almost 12 to 15 years ago and a greenfield golf course was supposed to be created and each of the farmer was promised job in maintenance. The land was acquired at a throw- away rate of ₹1.5 lakh per acre. But neither the golf course materialised nor did the farmers get any job, said Mr. Nagendra.
 Self-reliant and independent farmers overnight turned into daily wagers and began to work on what was their own land till the sale was completed. But after a few months even the daily wage was stopped and there was no sign of the golf course. Subsequently it transpired that the same land was offered for sale to the Karnataka Industrial Area Development Board (KIADB) at the rate of nearly ₹50 lakh per acre.
 “The farmers have not given up the physical possession yet but the land is no longer in their name’’, said Mr. Nagendra who said that the farmers’ outfit will take up the struggle for land restoration.
 The KRRS and Hasiru Sene also cited another example wherein a major private company acquired about 175 acres of land at the rate of ₹27 lakh per acre. In addition the farmers were promised a job as part of the compensation package by the KIADB. However, the farmers learnt to their chagrin that the job on offer was not locally but in the Hebbal industrial area in Mysuru.
 “Though the distance may not seem much, the farmers prefer to work in Nanjangud area as most of them have retained a small bit of land to cultivate crops for self-sustenance. Travelling to and from Mysuru regularly will force them to abandon agriculture altogether’’, said the farmers.

As winter nears and coronavirus cases surge across the Middle East, the regional director for the World Health Organization said Thursday the only way to avoid mass deaths is for countries to quickly tighten restrictions and enforce preventative measures.In a press briefing from Cairo, Ahmed al-Mandhari, director of WHO's eastern Mediterranean region, which comprises most of the Middle East, expressed concern that countries in the area were lowering their guard after tough lockdowns imposed earlier this year.The fundamentals of pandemic response, from social-distancing to mask wearing, "are still not being fully practiced in our region," he said, adding that the result is apparent throughout the region's crowded hospitals.Noting that the virus had sickened over 3.6 million people and killed more than 76,000 in the region over the past nine months, al-Mandhari warned "the lives of as many people -- if not more -- are at stake," urging action to "prevent this tragic premonition from becoming a reality." More than 60 per cent of all new infections in the past week were reported from Iran, which has seen the worst outbreak in the region, as well as Jordan and Morocco, he said. Cases are also up in Lebanon and Pakistan. Jordan, Tunisia and Lebanon have reported the biggest single-day death spikes from the region.From Pakistan, Faisal Sultan, special assistant to the prime minister for national health services, told reporters the winter surge had arrived. Although Pakistan managed to control the outbreak with targeted restrictions earlier this year, the forecast turned more alarming as the country unlocked, he said."The second wave is just as risky if not more than the first," Sultan said, adding that winter in Pakistan brings an increase in social interaction, with schools, events and wedding parties in full swing.

 “We had started immediately with the financial packages in March,” Mr. Mehta emphasised.
 The court was hearing individual borrowers, power, industry and business sectors on the compound interest or interest-on-interest pay-back scheme introduced by the government and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) for borrowers struggling to make ends meet after the expiry of the six-month moratorium period on August 31.
 Mr. Mehta said the court should now dispose of the petitions post the implementation of the pay-back scheme by November 5. Any grievances from specific sectors can be addressed directly to the government itself.
 “This is a fiscal policy matter. Government is on top of it. Grievance redressal mechanism lies within the system itself. To ask for sector-specific reliefs from the court will not be a remedy available under Article 32 of the Constitution,” Mr. Mehta submitted.
 The main petitioner, Gajendra Sharma, who represents individual borrowers in the Supreme Court, has already expressed satisfaction with the government scheme to pay back the difference in the compound interest and simple interest charged during moratorium for eight categories of loans worth up to ₹2 crore. The scheme covers MSME, education, housing, consumer durables, credit card, auto, personal and consumption loans.
 “Banking sector may not be able to bear any further financial strain,” Mr. Mehta submitted.
 However, senior advocate A.M. Singhvi, for power producers, said there are still loopholes left to plug or the “big borrowers” may go down under.
 Mr. Singhvi said the RBI circular of October 26, introducing the pay-back scheme, has created inadvertent exclusions. Highend power producers, struggling under non-payment of ₹1.22 lakh crore of consumer dues, have not been allowed to restructure. He said there is a need to “tweak” the circular to protect the various sectors.
 Finally, the court allowed parties to hand over their suggestions to the government and the RBI, so that they could get instructions and respond in time to the court. The parties have been also asked to file written submissions. The court scheduled a hearing next week.
 The pay-back scheme was introduced “to bring additional relief” to borrowers.
 “The Central Government has directed that all lending institutions shall give effect to the scheme and credit the amount calculated as per the scheme into the accounts of the borrowers by November 5,” the Ministry of Finance had said in a short affidavit in court.
 Clause three of the waiver scheme defined “all financial institutions” to include banking companies, public sector banks, cooperative banks, regional rural banks, all India financial institutions, non-banking financial companies, housing finance companies registered with RBI, national housing banks.

Celeb couple Gurmeet Choudhary and Debina Bonnerjee recently donated plasma for critical Covid-19 patients. They feel people who have recovered from Covid should come forward and help others in any form possible.
 Bonnerjee shares, "When we had Covid, I'd decided to donate plasma as it is the need of the hour. I had heard about how Covid was affecting people leading to rising number of deaths. We are lucky to be cured and if we can help someone, then why not? It was an easy decision to donate plasma."


 Choudhary agrees, adding that it was his wife's idea to donate plasma. "We had also read that many people who had recovered from Covid feared losing the antibodies. So, we wanted to break the myth and there's nothing better than leading by example. We are hopeful that our plasma helps others and brings more plasma donors forward," he says.
 The procedure is different from blood donation and has to be monitored carefully, says Bonnerjee, adding that people can donate plasma in a government hospital where it would help the needy free of cost or in a private hospital where it be bought be ones who need it.
 The couple urges people to be aware, continue to be vigilant regarding coronavirus and take the need precautions as with the ease of movement and a number of places opening up, more ad more people have been stepping out of their homes. "People are sick and tired of staying at home and are stepping out. But that doesn't mean the situation is getting better. The number of positive patients hasn't gone down drastically and many people are facing adverse reactions to the virus and need treatment. Then there are others with mild symptoms and don't suffer much. We all have to work as a society and look after ourselves and our surroundings carefully so that all of us are safe," concludes Bonnerjee.

They feel people who have recovered from Covid should come forward and help others in any form possible. Bonnerjee shares, "When we had Covid, I'd decided to donate plasma as it is the need of the hour. I had heard about how Covid was affecting people leading to rising number of deaths. We are lucky to be cured and if we can help someone, then why not? It was an easy decision to donate plasma."

We are hopeful that our plasma helps others and brings more plasma donors forward," he says. The procedure is different from blood donation and has to be monitored carefully, says Bonnerjee, adding that people can donate plasma in a government hospital where it would help the needy free of cost or in a private hospital where it be bought be ones who need it. The couple urges people to be aware, continue to be vigilant regarding coronavirus and take the need precautions as with the ease of movement and a number of places opening up, more ad more people have been stepping out of their homes. "People are sick and tired of staying at home and are stepping out. But that doesn't mean the situation is getting better. The number of positive patients hasn't gone down drastically and many people are facing adverse reactions to the virus and need treatment. Then there are others with mild symptoms and don't suffer much. We all have to work as a society and look after ourselves and our surroundings carefully so that all of us are safe," concludes Bonnerjee.
