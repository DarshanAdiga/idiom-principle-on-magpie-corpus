ON HIS FEELINGS ABOUT DYLAN NOW: “One of the saddest things of my life was that I was deprived of the years of raising Dylan and could only dream about showing her Manhattan and the joys of Paris and Rome. To this day, Soon-Yi and I would welcome Dylan with open arms if she’d ever want to reach out to us as Moses (Farrow) did, but so far that’s still only a dream.”

The GBP/USD pair peaked at 1.1714 at the beginning of the day but ended it in the red around 1.1530. UK PM Boris Johnson addressed the nation on Sunday, announcing that the government will start to take special steps to fight the coronavirus outbreak, warning that the UK is heading towards a lockdown, after appeals to stay indoors were largely ignored. The number of cases in the UK has jumped to 5,911 while the death toll rose to 335. The soft approach of the UK government to the outbreak is back on the table, as the government is still considering whether or not to lock down the country and the closure of all non-essential shops.

Bright Eyes have released a new song titled “Persona Non Grata.” The single marks their first new music in nine years, following 2011’s The People’s Key. The band also confirmed they will release a new album this year via their newly signed label, Dead Oceans.   “Getting dressed for a date/put on blue aftershave,” Conor Oberst sings in the track’s opening lines, led by sparse piano. “Wore a kilt like a kelt/hid the weight that I felt.” A minute into the song, searing bagpipes enter.   Bright Eyes previously announced a massive 2020 world tour, but in a letter accompanied by the single, they admitted the trek is up in the air due to the coronavirus pandemic.   “Strange days indeed,” they wrote. “We, like so many others, had many plans for 2020. We will be releasing a new album this year no matter what. We also have lots of touring plans that we are now reassessing. We will keep you informed as things progress. We very much want to get on the road and hope to see you all in person sooner rather than later.”
 “Until then, here is a song called ‘Persona Non Grata,'” they continued. “We hope you like it. It was hard to decide which song to share first because they are all quite different, but this one seemed as good of a place as any to start. And it has bagpipes! Which is a first for us.”

What is it with falling in love with the grandparents on this show? In “This Big, Amazing, Beautiful Life,” we get to learn a lot more about Deja’s backstory and tough upbringing--and meet her amazing grandma Joyce, who mostly takes care of her because her mom, Shauna, was only 16 years old when she had Deja. When Joyce dies, it marks the point where things really start to go downhill for Deja and Shauna, and they end up sleeping in their car until Beth and Randall find them. When Shauna realizes Deja can have a better life living with the Pearsons and leaves in the middle of the night, it broke us all.

Remember the time that Kevin was upset and drove off from his brother Randall’s house drunk? Yep, that was a dumb move. But what made it even worse was the little stowaway in the backseat. Yes, the midseason finale of Season 2 saw Kevin behind the wheel of a car while under the influence with Tess right there behind him. She snuck away when Randall and Beth were saying goodbye to Deja, a teenager they were fostering who was taken back by her biological mother. While we knew before the end of the episode everyone was safe (thank goodness), Kevin was arrested on a DWI -- in front of his niece. And of course Randall and Beth were waiting at home to kill him. Now these were probably some rage tears.

Pennsylvania State Police issued 27 warnings, including three by the troop that covers the Lehigh Valley, on the first day of enforcement for non-life- sustaining businesses to shut down.
 No citations were issued, yet.
 Enforcement will start with warnings to gain voluntary compliance, followed by enforcement as necessary, Colonel Robert Evanchick, commissioner of the Pennsylvania State Police, said in a news release Tuesday morning.
 State police are not revealing the type of businesses that received warnings or their home counties.
 “We want businesses to comply. We are prepared to take further enforcement action as needed,” Trooper Nathan Branosky, spokesman for Troop M, said. Troop M covers the Lehigh Valley.
 A list of what the state considers life-sustaining businesses, and some of the non-life-sustaining businesses, can be found here.
 If someone sees a business they think should be closed, they could call their local police department’s or state police barracks’ non-emergency number. Don’t call 911.
 Branosky said troopers have been fielding phone calls from business asking if they should be shut down, when businesses need to contact the state Department of Community and Economic Development.
 Businesses closed under the order that feel they should be allowed to remain open can apply for a waiver online here.
 Under the Emergency Management Services Code, the governor is granted extraordinary powers upon his declaration of a disaster emergency, such as the coronavirus. Last week, Wolf announced the shutdown.
 The governor has said a shutdown is the only way to prevent coronavirus from spreading and to prevent Pennsylvania’s health care industry from becoming completely overwhelmed.
 Enforcement was initially scheduled to begin at 12:01 a.m. Saturday, but the state was inundated by businesses filing waiver requests so enforcement was rescheduled to start at 8 a.m. Monday.
 Local and state police are authorized to enforce the shutdown.
 “As expected, we found the overwhelming majority of people and businesses across the commonwealth are voluntarily complying with the order and doing their part to stop the spread of COVID-19,” Evanchick said.
 Failure to comply with the new shutdown requirements mean business owners can face citations, fines or license suspensions.

The USD/JPY pair is once again ending the day with gains, not far from a fresh monthly high of 111.59. The Japanese currency appreciated at the beginning of the day as expected, as market players reacted to risk-averse weekend news. However, speculative interest returned to the greenback, moreover after the US Federal Reserve announced unlimited QE to counter the ongoing crisis. The pair surged, despite US equities remained in the red and US Treasury yields edged lower.

 TOKYO/ATHENS (Reuters) - The Tokyo Olympics were postponed on Tuesday to 2021, the first such delay in the Games' 124-year modern history, as the coronavirus crisis wrecked the world's last sporting showpiece still standing this year.
 Though a huge blow to Japan, which has invested $12 billion in the run-up, the move was a relief to thousands of athletes fretting over training as the world headed into lockdown to fight a disease that has claimed more than 16,500 lives.
 Pressure had been building on the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and its president, Thomas Bach, with some athletes and sporting bodies angry that a seemingly inevitable decision had taken so long.
 After a call between Bach and Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, both said the July 24-Aug. 9 Games would move to summer 2021 at the latest in a hoped-for celebration of triumph over the pandemic.
 The Olympic flame, already lit at Olympia in Greece and taken to Japan for a now-cancelled torch relay, would stay in the host nation as a symbol of hope.
 "Sport is not the most important thing right now, preserving human life is," Bach said. "This Olympic flame will be the light at the end of this tunnel."
 Though it was the first Olympics' postponement, the Games were cancelled outright three times during the last century's two World Wars. Cold War boycotts also disrupted the Moscow and Los Angeles Olympics in 1980 and 1984.
 ATHLETES SAD BUT RELIEVED
 Athletes were disappointed but broadly endorsed the delay, given health risks and disruption to their training as gyms, stadia and swimming pools closed around the world.
 "I compete in a little bike race, which is nothing compared to what is going on in the world right now," said American Olympic BMX champion Connor Fields, who had been looking forward to his sport's Games debut.
 Many began focussing on next year's competition.
 "We'll be more ready than ever in 2021 and wearing the maple leaf with more pride than I thought possible," said Canadian Olympic wrestling champion Erica Wiebe, describing her feelings as: "Utter relief. Excitement. Uncertainty."
 The coronavirus outbreak has raged around the world this year, infecting nearly 380,000 people and wiping out the international sporting calendar.
 Though 2021 looks crowded, as the sports world makes up for this year's cancellations, World Athletics said it was willing to move its world championships, scheduled for Aug. 6-15, 2021, in Oregon, to make way for the Olympics. [nL8N2BG9EZ]
 It was not yet clear whether athletes who had already secured spots in Tokyo this summer - more than half of those due to compete - would need to qualify again. The Athletics Association said a poll of more than 4,000 track and field competitors showed 78% had wanted the Games delayed.
 "My heart breaks for you," U.S. Olympic and Paralympic CEO Sarah Hirshland said in a message to athletes.
 "This summer was supposed to be a culmination of your hard work and life's dream, but taking a step back from competition to care for our communities and each other is the right thing to do. Your moment will wait until we can gather again safely."
 TWICE UNLUCKY FOR JAPAN
 Tuesday's decision came 122 days before the planned opening ceremony at Japan's newly built National Stadium, which was to usher in the 16-day event featuring 11,000 athletes from 206 nations and territories.
 It is not the first time a Japanese Olympics has run into problems. Both the 1940 Summer and Winter Olympics were to be held in Japan but were cancelled due to World War Two.
 Despite their disappointment, not to mention the logistical headaches and financial losses to come, a poll indicated that about 70% of Japanese agreed with a delay. [nL4N2BG5V2]
 The postponement is a deep disappointment for Japan's prime minister, who has staked his legacy on the Games' success and hoped it would bring a tourism and consumer boom. Such was his enthusiasm that he appeared as video game character Super Mario at the 2016 Olympics' closing ceremony. [nL4N2BD1KE]
 Postponing the Olympics is almost certain to push Japan's economy, the world's third largest, into recession. [nL1N2BH0H8]
 Ami Takada, 18, who just graduated from high school and was walking in a Tokyo restaurant district, wondered if the coronavirus would really be over by next year to allow a delayed Games to take place.
 "If they don't hold the Olympics, it's the end for the Japanese economy," he worried.
 IOC boss Bach is also in a tricky situation, after his repeated statements that the Games were on track brought a backlash from athletes and some national Olympic committees.
 That, combined with disquiet over his support for Russian athletes to continue competing as neutrals despite their nation's doping scandal, has threatened his grip on the IOC.
 Bach is up for re-election next year.
