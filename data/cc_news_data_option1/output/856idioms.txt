Two weeks later, while technically safe, Cecilia is still suffering. She’s staying with a friend, James (Aldis Hodge), to keep Adrian from finding her in a moment of respite that hit home. One of my major obstacles to leaving my first husband was the knowledge that he knew where I would go. He knew where my parents and friends lived, and he knew where I worked. In order to fully leave him, I would have had to rip apart my life and leave everything behind. I would also be exposing my friends, family, and coworkers to his violence. Adrian knows where Emily lives, so any contact with Cecilia puts her in danger as well — and it most certainly does.

Three BJP supporters have been arrested for raising provocative slogan -- desh ke gaddaro ko, goli maro ... shoot the traitors -- while heading for Union Home Minister Amit Shahs rally in the city on Sunday, a senior Kolkata Police official said. They were produced in a city court on Monday which sent two of them -- Pankaj Prasad and Surendra Kumar Tewary -- to police custody for three days, while Dhruva Basu was granted bail on grounds of age and ill health, he said.The city police had arrested the trio on Sunday night, hours after Shahs rally, based on the complaint lodged by a person at the New Market police station and after identifying them from the video footage of the Sundays procession, he said. The video footage was shared with the home department and the arrests were made after getting its nod, he said.The state BJP leadership has denied the involvement of any party worker in the incident and termed it as the handiwork of the TMC Trinamool Congress. The official said the three have been booked for promoting enmity between different groups and doing acts prejudicial to maintenance of harmony, criminal intimidation, committing public mischief and common intention.This illegal act of passing provocative slogans was done by BJP supporters. It is a cognisable offence, a senior Kolkata Police official said. We are conducting raids in search of other accused persons who have been identified from the video footage, he added.The West Bengal unit of BJP came under fire after the incident of sloganeering. The men shouted the slogan while they were passing the Maidan Market in downtown Esplanade en route to the rally venue at nearby Shahid Minar ground.The union home minister was on a day-long visit to Kolkata on Sunday. There has been a controversy over raising of such slogans during BJP rallies during Delhi assembly polls and protests in favour of the Citizenship Amendment Act CAA due to allegations that they provoke violence.Meanwhile, Kolkata Police Commissioner Anuj Sharma on Monday directed the officers-in-charge of all police stations in the city to initiate strong legal action against any person who tries to provoke in any way which may lead to a breach in peace, sources said..

Bazant negotiated similar extensions with Arizona State and Seton Hall for Hurley and Willard, respectively. Hurley received a two-year extension through 2023-24 and that contract tops out at $2.7 million for that season, plus a $500,000 retention bonus payable on Jan. 1, 2024. It’s unclear how much more money and years Willard received because Seton Hall is a private institution, but a source indicated the raise was significant from his 2018-19 salary of $2.1 million.

But since Harrison is especially charmed by Captain Clark's whole "charming Captain Clark" act, the plan becomes that the captain should schmooze him back to the side of Avenue 5 over dinner at the Captain's Table that evening. Unfortunately, just before the dinner, comms are restored to the Avenue 5, and Captain Clark learns two things: first, that the rescue mission scheduled for three and a half years from now involves him having to learn how to actually fly this space ship and dock it in what amounts to a floating airport terminal because his handprints are the only ones paired with the emergency console -- well, other than Joe's, whose hands are in a golden coffin caught up in a poop orbit and attached to a dead man. And _second_ , Captain Clark learns he's being served divorce papers by his husband and wife back home…


--DocBreak--
Riiiight up until Billie realizes that Captain Clark will still have to be the one to dock the ship at the rescue station, and while learning to fly a space ship in 3.5 years was already a monumental task, learning to fly a space ship in six months is an impossible one. So maybe -- just _maybe --_ it's a good thing that Rav just stowed away on the emergency supply shuttle headed toward the Avenue 5 with intentions of using Mr. Judd as a giant blast shield of blame to hide behind from everyone protesting her back home. Or maybe everyone will just get a few medical supplies, some flavoring for their food, and a fiery, fiery death. Only time will tell!

Tamper-evident packaging is increasing by leaps and bounds globally, as product counterfeiting has become a concerning factor. Void pattern tamper- evident tapes simply leave a VOID or OPENED message to carton surfaces, providing convenience to the consumer. Manufacturers are adopting void pattern tamper-evident tapes to enhance the safety measures and security of the product. Void pattern tamper-evident tapes provide superior authentication to different industrial products. They offer a positive control over unauthorized interference with any packaging content. Void pattern tamper-evident tapes are used for different types of applications such as cardboard box seals, chemical drum seals, carton seals, and document seals among others. Void pattern tamper-evident tapes, when applied, can only be opened for the targeted application, as it detects an already-used product from a distance. The void pattern tamper-evident tapes market is estimated to expand during the forecast period, as tamper-evident packaging is essential for valuable and delicate products. Void pattern tamper-evident tapes are made up of high-quality materials which include polyethylene in it. Hence, these are suitable for almost all outdoor and indoor surfaces.

As Frank notes when he spots the papal face: "JP was one of the good ones too -- wasn't even a Nazi in his youth." Whether it's his distinct lack of connection to genocide, or his religious significance, something about the general outline of Pope John Paul II's face coming round the poop orbit every 90 minutes on the dot has noticeably lifted the spirits of the Avenue 5 passengers.

Dear reader,
 In the rough and tumble of political journalism, respect can be a casualty. And so it was Feb. 25 in India, when President Donald Trump and CNN’s Jim Acosta clashed at a press conference.
 Mr. Acosta had said, in response to criticism, that his network was better at “delivering the truth” than the president. Later that day Chris Wallace, host of Fox News Sunday, said he was “horrified” by the CNN correspondent’s behavior.
 “It’s not our job to get in fights with the president,” Mr. Wallace said at an event at Columbia University’s Graduate School of Journalism in New York. “It’s not our job to one-up presidents.”
 The other panelist on stage, New York Times White House correspondent Maggie Haberman, agreed.
