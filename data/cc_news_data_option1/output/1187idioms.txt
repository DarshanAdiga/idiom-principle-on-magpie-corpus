Dear Dave,   In light of recent events in our country, do you have suggestions for things people should think about and plan for if they get laid off from their jobs?   Sam
 Dear Sam,   It's no secret that things are shutting down all across the world. If your workplace has closed its doors and isn't offering pay, then it's time to regroup and get some things in order. The thought of being without a paycheck can be overwhelming, but a little thought and planning can help you get through times like these.
 Start living on a budget, if you aren't doing so already. Making a monthly budget will show you exactly where your money is going. Without it, you can't use every dollar to its fullest potential, because you don't even know how much money you have to work with. Plus, your budget will show places where you can cut back and save money.
 If you don't have any income right now, make a budget based on the amount of money on hand. If you have $600 left to your name, budget out exactly where each of those dollars will go. It's time to squeeze every last penny out of what you've got. If you still have cash coming in from a spouse's job or some other source, then adjust your budget to reflect that. Maybe the two of you usually bring in a combined $5,000 a month. Adjust your budget to live off that one income for the time being.
 When the going gets tough, you need to focus on the things you really need to survive - food, utilities, shelter and transportation. I call these the Four Walls. If there's any money left over after you take care of the Four Walls, make a list of what else you need to pay, and tackle those in order of importance. Reach out to anyone you can't pay, and explain the situation. They might be able to work something out, but they can't help if they don't know. Be upfront with them, and pray for the best.
 When you're just trying to make it to another day, you don't need to pay extra on debt. Instead, focus on piling up cash. Once life gets back to normal and everything is okay, you can pick up where you left off with your debt snowball. If it's within your budget to keep making minimum payments on your debt, go for it. But the Four Walls come first. This is also the time to sell anything and everything you don't need to make some extra cash.
 With so much being shut down right now, there might not be as many traditional ways to make extra money. So, look into driving for Amazon, delivering takeout food or dropping off grocery orders. Even if one of those doesn't work out, you can still take up odd jobs around your neighborhood. Be on the lookout for opportunities that will add a few extra bucks to your pocket. Don't forget to cut back on unnecessary expenses, either. Stop or pause your subscriptions. Call your cable, internet and cellular providers to see if there's anything they'll do to work with you.
 Finally, in times of real need, don't be too proud to ask for a helping hand. Many churches and community groups in your area exist for situations just like this.
 God bless you all!   Dave

“¡Paren el mundo que me quiero bajar!”, dice una frase que falsamente se le ha atribuido a Mafalda, la famosa niña de la tira cómica creada por Quino. Cuando la leí por primera vez, hace años, me daba risa por lo absurdo. Pero en este 2020 el mundo, de pronto, se paró. Y lo que no podemos hacer es bajarnos. Este es el único planeta que tenemos, no hay plan B y nuestro destino, como el de todas las especies, es buscar maneras de sobrevivir.


  Y lo vamos a hacer. Para el próximo año, espero, habrá una vacuna y un tratamiento para el Covid-19, la enfermedad causada por el coronavirus descubierto recientemente.

Quyết định này được Tổng giám mục Tổng giáo phận TP HCM Giuse Nguyễn Năng đưa ra chiều 25/3, theo đề nghị của chính quyền thành phố, trước tình hình dịch bệnh đang ngày càng nghiêm trọng.


  Tổng giám mục Giáo phận TP HCM đề nghị các linh mục cử hành thánh lễ hàng ngày một cách riêng tư vì "Thánh lễ là cử hành mầu nhiệm Thánh giá và phục sinh của Chúa, là trung tâm và đỉnh cao của đời sống Hội thánh Công giáo".


  Các nhà thờ được yêu cầu không tổ chức cầu nguyện đông người, song vẫn mở cửa để giáo dân đến cầu nguyện riêng. Giáo dân được kêu gọi siêng năng cầu nguyện, đọc kinh, lần hạt Mân Côi hoặc tham dự thánh lễ trực tuyến vào 5h30 và 17h30 mỗi ngày trên website của Tổng giáo phận TP HCM.


  Về thánh lễ an táng, các linh mục chỉ tổ chức tại nhà thờ của giáo xứ với sự tham dự của thân nhân, họ hàng gần; không cử hành thánh lễ cầu hồn tại gia đình.


  Tổng giám mục Giuse Nguyễn Năng cho biết đây là một quyết định "rất khó khăn", nhất là trong những ngày cao điểm của Tuần Thánh và Phục sinh - Thánh lễ quan trọng nhất của người Công giáo. Chưa bao giờ các linh mục và người Công giáo phải ngưng Thánh lễ và các buổi cầu nguyện như thế này.


  "Tuy nhiên, chúng ta và người dân cả nước cần phải tranh thủ giai đoạn vàng này để khỏi vỡ trận trước dịch bệnh. Việc ngưng các sinh hoạt cộng đồng không chỉ là lo cho sự an toàn bản thân mà còn là hành vi bác ái và đầy tinh thần trách nhiệm vì chúng ta thuộc về một cộng đồng dân tộc và cộng đồng nhân loại", thông báo của Tổng giám mục Tổng giáo phận TP HCM viết.


  Chiều qua, Phó chủ tịch thường trực UBND TP HCM Lê Thanh Liêm đã ký văn bản yêu cầu toàn bộ cơ sở dịch vụ ăn uống có quy mô trên 30 người, bida, phòng gym, spa, tiệm hớt tóc... phải dừng hoạt động để phòng chống Covid-19. Trước đó, từ ngày 15/3, chính quyền thành phố đóng cửa toàn bộ 180 vũ trường, bar, beer club; gần 500 quán karaoke; massage, rạp chiếu phim, game online...


  TP HCM và cả nước vào cao điểm của Covid-19 trong hai tuần, tính từ hôm nay - quyết định sự thành bại của cuộc chiến chống dịch bệnh. Người dân thành phố cũng được chính quyền kêu gọi "sống khác, tiết kiệm hơn, ít đi lại hơn" trong thời gian này.

El acabado que queremos dar a las canciones es el indie de los noventa, apuntamos hacia ahí y queremos reivindicar ese rollo que está muriendo. En cuanto a temática, lo que nos sale un poco. Somos dos quienes componemos; Javi, el guitarra, y yo. Según se me ocurre la melodía, por ejemplo, cuando voy por la calle, la grabo en una nota de voz, llego a casa y la grabo. Y luego entre los cuatro seguimos dándole la forma. A veces parece que son eclécticas, pero al final somos los mismo cuatro músicos con los mismos pedales y las mismas sonoridades, por lo que el resultado acaba siendo homogéneo.

What makes Johnson so lethal is that fact that even as a striker, he has more than one way to beat you. He can either play as a target forward, one who chases after through passes, or he can drop more central to receive the ball and make runs at the defense.
 “He’s the perfect false (No.) 9 — essentially a player who can be up there as a central target, but actually can come back to the ball,” Del Rio said. “[Defenders] don’t know if they should follow him inside or stay put, so it creates a lot of confusion (for opposing defenses).”
 As lethal and dominant Johnson has been at times this season, he recognizes that he can’t do it without the help of his teammates, especially fellow striker Kyle Nilsson, a junior. The two developed such a chemistry that they know what the other is doing and will trade off being the target forward.
 “He and I became so close and our chemistry was through the roof. The chemistry we had allowed us to flow super easily,” Johnson said. “The game is never set. It’s about learning in the moment and then adapting in that moment.
 “We had players around us with a great scheme. … I was put in position where it was easy to take the opportunity to score.”
 It’s no coincidence that Johnson’s emergence as an offensive force helped the Gators reach heights seldom seen as SHP has compiled a two-year, regular- season record of 33-0-4.
 “It was so much fun being a part of that,” Johnson said. “My sophomore year, we didn’t really have that good a league season. To come back my junior year to go undefeated and then proving to a lot of people (this year) we can continue to play at a high level was great.”
 Unfortunately for the Gators, the one win that eluded them was a CCS title. Last season, they were the No. 1 seed in Division I, losing in the semifinals. This year, they were No. 4 in the Open Division and advanced to the championship game, falling 1-0 to Bellarmine.
 “I know the coaches and players on the team really wanted to win CCS. And I know that to some people, making the Open Division was enough for our program, but for us, it wasn’t enough,” Johnson said. “It’s unfortunate (to fall short of a CCS title), but on the bright side, I’ve never had so much fun in a season before. … There are so many positives that came out of the season.”

Prof Ferguson, a key government adviser on the country's response to the crisis, was responsible for the Imperial College modelling that changed the government's approach.
 It found that only the most draconian social-distancing measures would be enough to prevent the health service being overwhelmed and as many as a quarter of a million people dying.
 On Wednesday, he told the science and technology MPs' committee that the latest research suggested as many as half to two-thirds of deaths from coronavirus might have happened this year anyway, because most fatalities were among people at the end of their lives or with other health conditions.
 ## Normal life
 The peak of demand for intensive care is expected to come in two to three weeks.
 The challenge the UK, and other countries, would then face, Prof Ferguson said, was how to move from a complete lockdown to a situation where some semblance of normal life could be allowed to restart, while still keeping coronavirus cases low.
 Part of this would be about significantly increasing the numbers of people being tested, until a vaccine could be found.
 But, Prof Ferguson added, the UK did not currently have the capacity to test on the level of countries such as South Korea.
