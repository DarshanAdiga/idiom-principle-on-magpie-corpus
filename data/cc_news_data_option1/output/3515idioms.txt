Based on the Dark Horse Comics series of the same name, _Dark Matter_ kicks off as six people wake up on a spaceship with no memories of who they are or how they ended up there. What follows are three seasons of adventures that gradually ratchet up the stakes while still focusing on glorious character development. Because when you don’t know whether you’re a hero or a villain, you have to redefine your identity. _Dark Matter_ also boasts three kickass female protagonists, including one of the most endearing Androids on television. So it was disheartening when Syfy made the shortsighted decision to cancel the show. We need more three-dimensional leading ladies interacting on our screens, and _Dark Matter_ has them in spades. Luckily, you can still binge every season on Netflix. — _Frannie Jackson_

It’s fitting, then, that so many sci-fi series take place in outer space, the vast and unknown frontier that Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos are presently elbowing each other to dominate. But these days, space-based series are moving well beyond the realm of pointy ears and little green men; in Netflix’s new original series _Away_ , the future is now, and being a space traveler is a job in the same way that being a consultant is a job: it necessitates a lot of time away from family, and long hours spent up in the air.
