 Chief Inspector Ian Hughes, District Commander for Southend, said: "I was disappointed to see the volume of people in the High Street, Leigh-on-Sea last night, however it is important to acknowledge that the majority of people continue to comply with social distancing.
 "As a result of the gathering and information we have received, we have dispersal order powers in place in the area highlighted.
 "The vast majority of people in my district have been doing the right thing and sticking to the Government guidance and we want to thank them for that.
 "We continue to engage with the public, explain the Government guidance, and encourage them to do the right thing and our officers continue to use their discretion and judgement in these situations. While enforcement is a last resort, my officers will take action if necessary."

La Guardia Costiera di Ortona ha sequestrato 2.000 ricci ancora vivi; sanzioni per complessivi 5.000 euro nei confronti di due subacquei e di un complice rimasto a terra, tutti provenienti dalla Puglia.
 Sequestrata l'intera attrezzatura da sub, i ricci sono stati rigettati in mare. L'operazione è iniziata quando nella zona del faro di Ortona sono stati notati due veicoli. Il personale della Capitaneria, in borghese, ha effettuato una lunga attivita' di appostamento in attesa del rientro a terra dei subacquei. Alle 2 del mattino i militari hanno bloccato i tre mentre stavano per caricare i ricci in macchina. Fra le violazioni contestate anche l'accesso a zone interdette del porto di Ortona.'
  _ 'Il riccio è una ricchezza tipica dei nostri mari_ - dice il comandante della Guardia Costiera Cosmo Forte - _indice anche del buono stato di salute dei nostri fondali. Continueremo a tutelare la sua presenza da queste scorribande irrispettose del mare e dell 'ambiente"._

A Tanzanian subsistence miner Saniniu Laizer hit the jackpot on Wednesday after the government handed him a cheque for 7.74 billion Tanzanian shillings ($3.35 million) for the two largest tanzanite gemstones ever found in the history.


  The two dark violet-blue gemstones, each about the size of a forearm, were discovered by Saniniu Laizer in one of the tanzanite mines in the north of the country which are surrounded by a wall to control cross-border smuggling of the gemstones.


  The first gemstone weighed in at 9.27 kg while the second weighed 5.103 kg, a mines ministry spokesperson said.

  Polls that show President Donald Trump trailing former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive 2020 Democratic presidential nominee, have been plentiful in recent weeks. But one survey that really stands out is a Fox News poll that shows Biden leading Trump by one percent in Texas. Obviously one percent is well within the margin of error. Yet while it is unlikely that Biden will defeat Trump in Texas, it isn't out of the question — and that poll underscores the inroads that Democrats have been making in the Lone Star State.


  Even if Trump ultimately defeats Biden in Texas, the very idea that the presidential race is competitive in that state is terrible news for his reelection campaign. Texas, in the past, was a state that Democratic strategists wrote off as a lost cause when it came to statewide races. When Democrats won in Texas in the 1990s or 2000s, it was usually mayoral races, city council races, or races in U.S. House of Representatives districts. But when it came to gubernatorial, presidential and U.S. Senate races, Democrats struggled in Texas.
