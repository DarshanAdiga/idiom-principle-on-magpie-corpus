His aim was to avoid getting dragged down by the uncertainty of such a large field and then unable to climb out of any hole that might have put him in. But if he had been on the ballot earlier, could he have blunted Biden's game- changing momentum in South Carolina on Saturday in some way? It's too late now.

This will be the second time the teams face each other in this year’s edition. In the previous meeting between the sides on February 23, United narrowly won the game by one wicket after a tough contest between the sides.
 United, the two-time champions lifted the title in 2016 and 2018, while they finished third in 2019 and 2017. Qalandars, on the other hand, have finished at the bottom of the league — fifth in 2016 and 2017 and sixth in 2018 and 2019.
 Qalandars started the tournament with a loss against Multan Sultans by five wickets, a one-wicket loss against Islamabad United and then a 16-run loss at the hands of Peshawar Zalmi.
 However, the Qalandars turned things around last night, winning their fourth match in style as they posted a huge total of 209 for five (the highest in the current tournament) against defending champions Quetta Gladiators and then bowling them out for 172 to record their first win.
 United, on the other hand, have played six games in the tournament so far, winning two and losing three. Their game against Peshawar Zalmi was abandoned without a ball being played due to rain.
 Both the teams boast a balanced squad with a mix of young and experienced players, national and international players.
 Qalandars led by Sohail Akhtar have the services of veteran all-rounder Mohammad Hafeez, along with wicketkeeper-batsman Ben Dunk who smashed ten sixes (a PSL record) during a brilliant inning of 93 against Gladiators.
 David Wiese, Samit Patel, Seekkuge Prasanna, Fakhar Zaman, Salman Butt, Chris Lynn, Shaheen Afridi, Haris Rauf, Usman Shinwari, Jaahid Ali and Dilbar Hussain make up the rest of the Qalandars squad.
 Islamabad led by young leg-spinner Shadab Khan, United have Faheem Ashraf, Hussain Talat, Asif Ali, Rizwan Hussain, Luke Ronchi, Muhammad Musa, Rumman Raees and Zafar Gohar.

Election integrity activists are raising concerns about Georgia's new voting machines, saying the large, bright, vertical touchscreens allow other people in the room to see a voter's selections in violation of ballot secrecy provisions in state law. In a petition filed Monday, Feb. 24, 2020, in Sumter County Superior Court against the five members of the county election board, the activists ask the court to order the board to have voters use hand-marked paper ballots rather than the touchscreen voting machines. less

Meanwhile, on Monday night, Sanders stumped at an arena in St. Paul, inviting Klobuchar and Buttigieg's backers to cast their ballots for him and urging Minnesotans not to join the moderate coalition aiming to block his path to the nomination.                                                Ave Green, 56, said her choice between the Democratic candidates changed several times before she made her final decision at a St. Paul precinct on Tuesday. She declined to share who she ultimately picked, but said she hopes to see a new president "who has a sense of dignity, inclusion and kindness" come January 2021.                                                Within recent years, Green said she sees a spike in hatred and bigotry, which she views as "in essence, backed by the president, what he says and does." She said she worries for her three teenage children and the future of the country.                                                "I’m worried about the racism. I’m worried about the temperature — what you can say and do now, and it’s OK," Green said. "I’m worried about young adolescents and the younger generation with that, and how it’s coloring their life."                                                For other voters, the choice was clearer as they went to the polls.                                                Eric Clapp, of Wadena, said he supported Elizabeth Warren because he appreciated her detailed plans and work with underserved communities. Warren garnered 16% of the vote with 85% of Minnesota precincts reporting.                                                “(She knows) you’re not going to overthrow the whole system but that there are ways that the system can work better for everyone, and I think that’s a really important thing," Clapp said. "And she with the plans that she’s released and has and the way that she’s spoken in the debates, she has a finger on that pulse of kind of what levers to pull within the system to make it more equitable."                                                The Republican primary left voters with less uncertainty about who to pick as only one candidate appeared on the ballot. GOP voters said they were glad to help re-elect President Donald Trump. With 66.64% of precincts reporting, Trump appeared poised to win the contest.                                                While there were some technical issues reported at polling locations, the primaries appeared to go off without a major issue on Tuesday. Some election officials reported low-turnout for both contests, but voters said they welcomed the return of the presidential primary over partisan caucuses.                                                "I like the primary," Aaron Pearson, of Pequot Lakes, said outside his polling location. "I think that more people are able to participate in a primary and I really appreciate that because I think more people should be involved in the political process. I do miss the caucus craziness a little bit, and feeling like you can make your voice heard a little bit more in the caucus, but the caucus is still happening.

California's probably the biggest change that candidates dropping out backing Biden might materialize in because there's that 15% threshold, right? Up until a few days ago, with a lot more candidates on the ballot, it looked like there was a chance that Bernie Sanders could be the only candidate to get more than 15% in California, which would have given him an enormous boost of delegates. That might not be the case tonight. We will keep our eye on California, but, one, the polls there don't close until 11 o'clock Eastern, and two, with so many vote by mail and provisional ballots, it's going to take a long time to know for sure what the breakdown is.

The Golden Door is located off Deer Springs Road and west of Interstate 15, just south of where Newland Sierra would be constructed. It has fought development plans in the area for more than a decade saying they are trying to protect the value of their property -- which depends on serenity and quiet for its wealthy guests. They also have maintained they are championing the residents of the area who oppose the project for a variety of reasons from traffic, to fire safety, to community character.
 In the weeks after the supervisors approval of the Newland Sierra, signature- gatherers paid by The Golden Door were able to obtain over 117,000 signatures to qualify the questions for the ballot.
 What will happen now to the Newland Sierra land is up in the air. The nearly 2,000-acre property located roughly five miles north of downtown Escondido, is currently zoned for 99 homes and 2 million square feet of commercial/office space.
 The commercial development could take place near the I-15/Deer Springs Road interchange, but few in the industry seem to think such a project makes any sense due to its location.
 The Measure B campaign spending, by both sides, has made it one of the most expensive in county history. Newland Communities LLC spent nearly $7 million, much of it on television commercials that have run incessantly for the past month on local airwaves.
 The Golden Door, in opposition to Measure B, likewise spent a lot of money on TV ads and other things -- more than $3 million.
 Measure A spending was considerably less, but still impressive. Supporters of Measure A had about $400,000 to work with, more than half from the Golden Door and much of the rest from the Endangered Habitats League, according to campaign financial disclosure forms.
 The No on A campaign spent roughly $1.6 million with most of the money coming from building industry-related companies.

Burke’s win sets her up to take the place of Vivian Burke, her mother-in-law, on the city council. Burke, the longest-serving council member, has been on the council for 42 years. Barbara Burke is currently a member of the Winston-Salem/Forsyth County School Board.                          Mundy’s victory gives him the likely chance of becoming the first openly gay member of the city council. Mundy, unopposed in November, would be filling a seat left vacant by incumbent Democrat Dan Besse, who is running for a seat in the N.C. House.                          Meanwhile, Democratic incumbents Annette Scippio (East Ward), D.D. Adams (North Ward) and John Larson (South Ward) beat challengers to win nominations for their seats. They will join Democratic incumbents Jeff MacIntosh (Northwest Ward) and James Taylor (Southeast Ward) on the fall ballot.                          MacIntosh and Taylor had no opposition and did not appear on the ballot.                          Republican incumbent Robert Clark fended off challenger George K. Ware in the West Ward, which offered the only GOP contest on the primary ballot among council races.                          Burke stressed her victory is “not about keeping it (the seat) in the Burke name,” but a reflection on the voters’ confidence in what she has done and can do.                          “It feels good that my community entrusted me with their votes,” she said. “I am bringing my 30 years of experience to the office. I’m excited about working and getting started.”                          Mundy stressed his determination to follow in the footsteps of Besse, but said that as a gay man he will bring a perspective to the council that has not been represented.                          “Human relations is a big deal,” he said. “We are all different and have to get along together. Our city council addresses racial and gender issues on a regular basis, but not so much the LGBTQ community because they have not had a representative to bring those issues to the forefront. My being gay will do nothing but make the city a more inclusive place.”

“And we feel that it places us in a better position to recruit the very best and retain the best,” Hairston said.                  In addition to community support, there was a lot of understanding about the importance of having the best teachers in the district, she said, referring to what she and her husband experienced Tuesday as they were out and about in the community.                  “It certainly aligns with our new mission statement, and I am so thankful to our community for collaborating and our commissioners and the board of education working together with our community to see this happen on behalf of all of our students,” Hairston said.                  Woodbury, chairwoman of the school board, spoke of the future of Winston-Salem/Forsyth County Schools.                  “Not only do I think we will come into the top three (counties) as it relates to teacher supplements in the state of North Carolina, but I anticipate that Winston-Salem/Forsyth County Schools will be No. 1 when it comes to student academic achievement,” Woodbury said. “This is just, I believe, an indication as it relates to the progress of our school district.”                  Val Young, president of the Forsyth County Association of Educators, said that the success of the referendum is a plus for both teachers and children.                  “It’s actually a win-win for our school system,” Young said. “It’s great to see that the taxpayers are standing with our district.                  Forsyth County Commissioner Don Martin said that so many people volunteered throughout the day Tuesday to get the word out about the quarter-cent sales tax.                  “Some people said they wished they could do more,” Martin said. “We got some real positive comments from teachers and a lot of people.”                  He said he believes the 2020 quarter-cent sales tax referendum passed compared to the 2018 similar referendum because an ad hoc group raised some private money.                  “That provided some fuel for a lot of campaign endeavors,” he said.                  He also said that the wording, by law, on both ballots in 2018 and on Tuesday did not give specifics on what the sales-tax increase was for.                  “This time, we succeeded with a lot of good work getting the message out from mailers to signs to billboards, and we really had polls covered today and polls covered almost every day during early voting,” he said.                  He also said that the 2018 ballot listed three long constitutional amendments, and then the quarter-cent sales tax.

Dear Abby,                  I dated a guy for 10 months. We constantly fought because of his lack of trust. He had been burned in previous relationships. He said, “Trust is earned, not given,” which isn’t my philosophy.                  After a recent argument (about lack of trust), I told him this attitude is a deal-breaker, and he needed time to reflect on his issues. I talked to him several days a week during the process, and we weren’t intimate during that time.                  I decided to have dinner with him at his apartment last night to further discuss the situation, only to have an old girlfriend ring his doorbell, upset. It seems that during the last five weeks, he had started seeing her again and slept with her while attempting to make amends with me. When I asked about her, he told me he thought we were done, and he was trying to put a Band-Aid on his pain. What to do?                  He has great qualities but is so jealous and suspicious. Will he ever improve, or will I always be trying to prove myself? I believe he cares for me, but his actions with the old girlfriend negate this. I cannot even begin to rationalize his thought process.                  Getting Tired Of It                  This guy is suspicious because HE isn’t trustworthy. There’s a saying attributed to historian, civil rights activist and author W.E.B. Du Bois: “A man does not look behind the door unless he has stood there himself.” People are often jealous and controlling because they are insecure. Your boyfriend ran back to his old girlfriend because he was unable to be alone, even for a brief period. Be smart. Wake up and lose him. You can do better.                  Dear Abby,                  My father was physically abusive to me when I was a child, and distant and emotionally abusive when I was a teenager. Because of it, I had low self-esteem and was extremely depressed for most of my life. I confronted him when I was an adult, and he tried to explain why he was that way, but never apologized.                  He is now 93 and in a nursing home. He probably won’t be alive much longer. I would like to get closure by telling him the extent to which his behavior damaged my life, but I know it would hurt him. Should I look for the closure I have needed all of my life, or keep it to myself to spare his feelings?                  Hurting Still In Colorado                  If you have things you need to get off your chest to your father, as painful as they may be, then do it. Explain calmly, in an even tone of voice, how important validation is to children as they develop, and how deeply his physical and emotional abuse has affected your life. I agree that he owes you an apology, but do NOT go there expecting one because he may be incapable of it.                  Dear Abby,                  Today I was in a small neighborhood restaurant with a friend. I ordered a special burger. When the cook brought it to the table, my friend immediately pulled out her camera and snapped several shots. A stranger who had been sitting at the bar jumped off his stool and came over to our table with his camera. I’m not sure how many photos of my meal were taken before I was able to start eating. My friend was logging onto Facebook to post before I took my first bite. I was dumbfounded. What can be said to people who are this rude?                  Get It While It’s Hot                  What can be said? Plenty — starting with, “Knock it off!” or “I don’t like that!” Talk about an invasion of privacy as well as personal space. I don’t blame you for feeling invaded.

But critics warn they are expensive to administer, easy to evade and often don't raise as much money as promised. They say that wealthy individuals have the means to move their assets to other countries, and that if the United States were to institute a wealth tax, one-percenters would just leave, although they would have to give up U.S. citizenship to avoid the IRS. And they say the taxes can punish people who own businesses that appear valuable on paper but generate little in the way of returns to pay the annual tax bill.

          As required by the election board, Shawnee City Commissioners approved a resolution Monday to call for the holding of nonpartisan general and general runoff elections to nominate and elect candidates for four board positions that will come to a close over the summer.                     The seats of Mayor Richard Finley, Ward 2 City Commissioner Ron Gillham Sr., Ward 3 City Commissioner James Harrod and Ward 4 City Commissioner Darren Rutherford are opening up for candidates this year.                     Harrod and Gillham have said they do not intend to run for another term.                     Though it is not official until filing next month, Ward 1 Shawnee City Commissioner Ed Bolt announced on social media months ago an intent to run for mayor.                     Rutherford said he hit the campaign trail last week to hold onto the Ward 4 seat.                     Shawnee City Manager Chance Allison said the filing period is April 8, 9 and 10.

Addis Ababa, March 4 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 4th Mar, 2020 ) :The United States has been "undiplomatic" in its role facilitating talks between three countries on the Nile River over a giant dam, Ethiopia said on Tuesday, but promised to continue negotiations.           The US has been enabling talks between Ethiopia, Egypt and Sudan over the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, set to become the largest hydropower plant in Africa.           The $4 billion project has set Addis Ababa and Egypt at loggerheads since Ethiopia broke ground in 2011 -- Cairo worried that filling a huge reservoir too quickly could staunch the Nile's flow lower down.           The US Treasury Department stepped in last year after Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi put in a request to his ally US President Donald Trump.           Last week, the Treasury Department said an agreement had been reached and urged Ethiopia to sign "at the earliest possible time" and Egypt said it had signed the "fair and balanced" deal.           But Ethiopia, which skipped the most recent round of talks, denied any deal had been agreed.           "The recent statement by the US we believe is undiplomatic and does not reflect a great nation like this," Ethiopian Foreign Minister Gedu Andargachew told a press conference on Tuesday.           "We want Americans to play a constructive role. Any other role is unacceptable," he said, warning Washington not to rush the process or try to influence the outcome.           Sisi's office said later the Egyptian president had been reassured by Trump that the US would stick with the talks until a deal was signed, though it was unclear if the reassurance came after Ethiopia's criticism.           Ethiopia sees the dam as essential for its electrification and development, but Egypt -- which depends on the Nile for 90 percent of its irrigation and drinking water -- sees it as an existential threat.

During the campaign, Hines touted her five years working in the magistrate’s office, including the last two years as chief magistrate. She argued that experience was needed to understand how things work at the Forsyth County Hallof Justice.                          Hines has a law degree from UNC Chapel Hill and has taught in the Winston-Salem/Forsyth County school system. She started working for the magistrate’s office in 2015.                          She said if she became Forsyth County Clerk of Court, she would increase staff training so that assistant clerks can provide information to the public about how to access services online. She also said she understood the operational side of the judicial system and could hit the ground running.                          Linville has practiced law for 36 years in a number of areas, including civil, family law, criminal and traffic. During the campaign, she said that among her accomplishments was helping establish a program to help people regain their driver’s licenses.

Lahore Qalandars face two-time champions Islamabad United in the 17th match of the Pakistan Super League at the Gaddafi Stadium tonight.
 The match will begin at 7pm.
 This will be the second time the teams face each other in this year's edition. In the previous meeting between the sides on February 23, United narrowly won the game by one wicket after a tough contest between the sides.
 United, the two-time champions lifted the title in 2016 and 2018, while they finished third in 2019 and 2017. Qalandars, on the other hand, have finished at the bottom of the league -- fifth in 2016 and 2017 and sixth in 2018 and 2019.
 Qalandars started the tournament with a loss against Multan Sultans by five wickets, a one-wicket loss against Islamabad United and then a 16-run loss at the hands of Peshawar Zalmi.
 However, the Qalandars turned things around last night, winning their fourth match in style as they posted a huge total of 209 for five (the highest in the current tournament) against defending champions Quetta Gladiators and then bowling them out for 172 to record their first win.
 United, on the other hand, have played six games in the tournament so far, winning two and losing three. Their game against Peshawar Zalmi was abandoned without a ball being played due to rain.
 Both the teams boast a balanced squad with a mix of young and experienced players, national and international players.
 Qalandars led by Sohail Akhtar have the services of veteran all-rounder Mohammad Hafeez, along with wicketkeeper-batsman Ben Dunk who smashed ten sixes (a PSL record) during a brilliant inning of 93 against Gladiators.
 David Wiese, Samit Patel, Seekkuge Prasanna, Fakhar Zaman, Salman Butt, Chris Lynn, Shaheen Afridi, Haris Rauf, Usman Shinwari, Jaahid Ali and Dilbar Hussain make up the rest of the Qalandars squad.
 Islamabad led by young leg-spinner Shadab Khan, United have Faheem Ashraf, Hussain Talat, Asif Ali, Rizwan Hussain, Luke Ronchi, Muhammad Musa, Rumman Raees and Zafar Gohar.

Charlotte City Councilwoman Dimple Ajmera was second at 34%, or 383,564, and Matt Leatherman of Raleigh third at 30.3%, or 341,201.                          Republican incumbent Dale Folwell of Winston-Salem wasn’t challenged in the primary.                          The State Board of Elections said a second primary is not necessary if the winning candidate receives more than 30% of the votes cast for all candidates in that contest.                          The three Democrats have put their focus on Folwell rather than each other, viewing him as vulnerable, in part because of his controversial Clear Pricing Project contract initiative for the State Health Plan in 2018-19 that could have affected the plan’s 727,000 participants.                          The contract was Folwell’s attempt to move the State Health Plan plan to a government pricing model tied to Medicare rates that would result in lower reimbursement rates to providers and cost savings to the plan.                          None of the major health-care systems in North Carolina signed up for the Clear Pricing Plan by the time Folwell backed down from the initiative in August. More than 727,000 State Health Plan participants stayed in-network during the 2020 coverage period with the same Blue Options preferred-provider-organization plans.                          The three Democrats all view Folwell as insufficiently supportive of North Carolina expanding Medicaid coverage to provide health care to 450,000 to 650,000 more residents.                          Chatterji said there is “nothing more local than health care, jobs and education, and the state treasurer can do a better job using the influence of the office to better the life of North Carolinians in those areas.”                          Falwell responded to his potential Democratic challengers by saying “as keeper of the public purse, I focus my time on saving and making money for those that teach, protect and serve and taxpayers like them.”

More than one-third of the delegates who will pick the eventual nominee at a July convention are up for grabs in primary elections on Tuesday that could provide some clarity at last in a muddled race for the White House.
 Early results showed Sanders holding a narrow lead over Biden in Texas, while Biden had a narrow lead in Massachusetts and Minnesota.
 The rush of early results left Michael Bloomberg, the billionaire former New York mayor who spent more than half a billion dollars on advertising, largely out of the running, with his only victory coming in the U.S. territory of American Samoa.

Most No. 1 picks are allowed to plant their roots in low-pressure environments.
 Last season, Deandre Ayton, the first overall selection in the 2018 draft, played for a 19-win Suns team that knew by Christmas it had as much of a chance of making the playoffs as it did of getting winter snow in Phoenix. During Karl-Anthony Towns’ rookie season in 2016-17, the Timberwolves won 29 games. Ben Simmons, the No. 1 overall selection the year after Towns, redshirted his first season entirely.
 The most recent No. 1 pick, Zion Williamson, has had an atypical experience. Williamson missed the first 44 games of the season with a right knee injury, and when he returned was immediately dropped into an environment with actual stakes. The Pelicans, despite losing 13 games in a row earlier this season, are trying to make the playoffs, and their margin for error is razor thin.
 “That’s the situation you want to be put in,” Williamson said. “I think it brings the greatness out of everybody. It’s one of those things where it’s like, ‘That adversity is in front of you. What are you going to do about it?’”
 Williamson scored 25 points in Tuesday’s loss to the Timberwolves, but he was clearly frustrated. The Pelicans surrendered 139 points to a team that had won two of its previous 22 games prior to its trip to New Orleans. Blowing a game at home to a bad opponent dropped the Pelicans to four games behind the eighth-seeded Memphis Grizzlies with only 21 games remaining.
 “This was one of those games we needed and we didn’t get,” Williamson said. “It was a tough loss. Every game matters. We need every win we can get.”

Poor defense was the Pelicans’ undoing. They allowed the Timberwolves to rack up 72 points in the paint even though Towns, their star big man, was unavailable. They didn’t contain on the perimeter, got beat on back cuts and allowed Minnesota to let fly far too many wide-open 3s.
 “I think we’re a smart enough team to understand what happened tonight,” Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said. “I don’t need to be pissed off or scream or yell or anything like that. We’re way beyond that. But they understand that we let a golden opportunity get slip by. We talked about winning at home and sustaining a run at home. This is one of those games you can’t lose really.”
 The Pelicans now face a situation where they need to beat a Mavericks team that’s been dominant in their previous three matchups or risk falling even further behind. They face the Mavericks on the road a little more than 24 hours after falling to the Timberwolves at home. It is the first back-to-back of Williamson’s career. He will play in it, though his minutes could be closely monitored.
 “I feel fine,” Williamson said. “We’ve got a great training staff. They’ll have me ready for tomorrow.”
 Tuesday marked the 12th straight game Williamson eclipsed the 20-point mark. Since 2000, Blake Griffin is the only rookie to have a longer streak of 20-point games with 14. Williamson has exceeded expectations and then some in the start to his career.
 Fewer than 20 games into his first season, Williamson is involved in a playoff chase where one or two more wrong turns could end New Orleans' postseason hopes. He is embracing the challenge and understands most players in his position don’t get to even attempt this.

BLACKFOOT – Going into the state wrestling championships, Blackfoot had to feel pretty good about its chances to gain a trophy. The Broncos would be chasing Kuna, Century, and Columbia, but with a dozen wrestlers competing and with some highly seeded wrestlers in Taye Trautner, Esai Castaneda, and Nick Chappell wrestling well and coming off of district titles, it was assumed that the Broncos could fight their way into a top four finish.
 When things were all said and done, it had to be a disappointing tournament for Blackfoot as top-seeded Nick Chappell, who had a championship season, was defeated in the finals, Esai Castaneda also fell in the finals, and several medal hopefuls never got to the medal stand.
 Overall, the Broncos finished eighth in the tournament, not what was expected.
