 El Tribunal Penal Especial de Eslovaquia declaró este jueves como no culpable al empresario Marian Kucner, acusado de haber encargado en 2018 el asesinato del periodista de investigación Jan Kuciak, un crimen que causó un terremoto político en el país centroeuropeo, y en el que ha sido condenado a 25 años de cárcel un expolicía.
 También fue declarada inocente Alena Zsuzsová, la supuesta intermediaria con los asesinos, al considerar el Tribunal que no existen pruebas que relacione a los dos acusados con el crimen, informó la televisión TA3 en directo desde el juzgado situado en Pezinok, al noreste de Bratislava.
 Sin embargo, el expolicía Tomas Szabo, otro de los acusados, fue condenado a 25 años de prisión por ser cómplice en el asesinato a tiros de Kuciak y de su novia en febrero de 2018.
 Al leer el juez la sentencia con la absolución, la familia del periodista asesinado abandonó en protesta la sala, al igual que el editor jefe del portal Aktuality.sk y antiguo jefe de Kuciak.
 La fiscalía de Eslovaquia puede recurrir la sentencia, que aún no es firme.
 El juicio más esperado en la historia reciente del país terminó así con una inesperada puesta en libertad de Kuciak y Zsuzsová, con lo que sigue la incógnita acerca de los autores intelectuales del asesinato del joven periodista de 27 años.
 Tras el asesinato, Eslovaquia vivió una ola de protestas contra el sistema político y judicial sin precedentes en la historia democrática del país.
 Kuciak había escrito sobre negocios turbios de Kocner, un empresario multimillonario, pero también sobre corruptelas entre la política y ciertas empresas.
 El entonces primer ministro, el socialdemócrata Robert Fico, acabó dimitiendo ante las protestas, para entregar el poder a su correligionario Peter Pelegrini, quien perdió las elecciones parlamentaria del pasado 29 de febrero.
 Desde entonces, gobierna el país una coalición liderada el populista conservador Igor Matovic.

Trump’s political strategy is to muddy the waters. But more broadly, Trump calls climate change a “hoax” and he, therefore, thinks that policies favoring renewables are a waste. He is now trying to reverse the Obama-Biden administration’s policies on CO2 and methane reductions — goals intended to promote fossil fuel production. To that end, the United States has become a net exporter of petroleum and natural gas under his watch.

What employers could do, as their own emergency response, is to stay the course and suffer through the economic setback, keeping workers paid as best they can, so that they can resume business at full capacity when the economy revives. And companies should tout their investment in social capital as proudly as they do their more conventional capital investments. If they do, the trust and motivation they will build would have an incalculable effect. “First, our public discourse and economic analyses need to take social capital more seriously. Second, we need to find a way to build trust and trustworthiness – in governments, communities, and their ability to support each other. Finally, we must re-think what constitutes capital investment. Much of social capital revolves around trust, dignity, and respect. Many key workers used to be referred to as “unskilled” or “low-wage” labour. Yet when push comes to shove – as it literally did in the quest for flour and toilet paper – they are the heroes, carrying their country through the crisis. Perhaps it is time to re-imagine . . . minimum wage increases as social capital investments, rather than economic costs.”

While some of the best TVs on the market feature the smartest interfaces to date, they still come with their limitations. Perhaps your favorite apps aren’t supported or your go-to streaming service isn’t built in.
 The solution? Streaming sticks and boxes. These handy devices enhance even the smartest of TVs, enabling users to access tons of streaming services and cast content from their phone, tablet or laptop. A good streaming stick or box can actually help lengthen a TV’s lifespan by adding smarts and upgrading picture quality so you don’t have to upgrade as often.
 You may already be familiar with the heavy hitters in the streaming sticks domain — Roku, Amazon’s Fire TV Stick, Apple TV and Google’s Chromecast — but picking the right one isn’t always a simple choice. Which serves the most use cases? Which is best for your particular needs? What does each bring to the viewing experience? And which will stretch your dollars furthest?

The wins for the Lakers were against Caldwell County, Graves County, Bowling Green, Mayfield and a team from Sikeston, Missouri. In the district playoffs, the Lakers lost 1-0 to Mayfield in the opening round. The district didn’t get any easier, but the Lakers bring back more starters from last year than any other team.
 With the loss of just three starting positions, the Lakers have the fewest holes to fill and head coach Evan Pierce is excited to see how those position battles play out at those spots.
 “There is definitely some competition in those spots, especially the center back spot,” Pierce said. “We feel like we have a few different players that could fill that role so we are just seeing how things are looking in practice.”
 After playing together all of last year, the core group of starters are familiar with each other and ready to transition from practice to competition.
 “I think that our team’s greatest strength is going to be the continuity that we have as a unit,” Pierce said. “This is a close group of players who have a great attitude, and after enduring some difficult times last season together, I think it is going to help strengthen us mentally and make us a stronger team this year.”

In July of 1990, a twenty-five year old musician, father, and farmer took his opportunity to serve his community with the Mecklenburg County Sheriff’s Office. Offered the position of jail deputy by former Sheriff, Harold Harris, James Snead embraced his career change and poured his heart and soul into his newly found passion for law enforcement.
 After beginning his career, Snead spent the next twenty-one years climbing through the ranks at the Sheriffs office. “I went to law enforcement basic road school in January of 1994 and after graduating in June, was assigned to patrol. In 2001 former Sheriff Lawrence Clary promoted me to Sergeant. I was promoted to Lieutenant by former Sheriff, Danny Fox in 2004. With this promotion I became responsible for day-to-day operations of the uniformed patrol unit. In 2006 I was raised to the position of Captain of the law enforcement division of the department, which included patrol units, investigations, and courtroom security. In August of 2008 I was selected by Sheriff Fox to be his Chief Deputy upon the retirement of Major George “Sport” Newcomb. I held that position until December 31, 2011. I will finish my career in courtroom security as a deputy,” said Snead.
 The life of a law enforcement officer can be challenging. According to Mr. Snead, being a deputy means not knowing from one minute to the next what you will be doing. “Unlike most jobs where you pretty much know what you will be doing today, tomorrow, and the after that, as a deputy, you can be serving a civil paper one minute and driving in excess of 100 miles per hour trying to get to a call where someone could be in serious danger. It’s a very unpredictable career.”
