stato presentato questa mattina il comitato civico "Alleanza Puntese", movimento pronto ad accogliere e aggregare coloro i quali intendono mettere a disposizione le proprie energie per il territorio di San Giovanni La Punta. A dare vita al comitato, i consiglieri comunali Laura Iraci e Giovanni Bottino, l'assessore alla Protezione civile, decoro e arredo urbano, sviluppo e recupero delle periferie e lavori pubblici, Vincenzo Castiglione, l'esperta in politiche ambientali Daniela Alchirafi e il responsabile alle politiche giovanili Luca Pappalardo. "La mission del comitato - spiegano i consiglieri Laura Iraci e Giovanni Bottino - e di riuscire a dare voce a tutte le anime del territorio che vorranno costruire insieme a noi un programma elettorale su misura per San Giovanni La Punta. Il bene comune continuera ad essere al centro delle nostre azioni politiche attraverso il miglioramento di strutture e servizi, e pianificando soluzioni ottimali che possano rispondere alle esigenze dei singoli quartieri". "Aderisco a questo progetto civico perche mi riconosco in esso e ritengo che fare l'amministratore sia, prima di tutto, servizio per il territorio e per la cittadinanza", afferma l'assessore Vincenzo Castiglione. "Daro una mano nella stesura delle proposte di programma da presentare al Sindaco, mettendo a disposizione le mie competenze tecniche". Un occhio di riguardo e riservato dal comitato alla tutela dell'ambiente. "Nella gestione di un territorio - dichiara Daniela Alchirafi - le politiche ambientali non possono rappresentare delle scelte marginali o comunque secondarie. Oggi si parla tanto di sostenibilita, green new deal, e di tutte quelle buone pratiche che devono e possono trovare riscontro anche a San Giovanni La Punta. L'obiettivo che ci prefiggiamo e di migliorare la vivibilita e la fruibilita del nostro Comune creando nuove possibilita di sviluppo, anche attraverso dei progetti mirati al raggiungimento degli obiettivi di green city". "Insieme ai miei colleghi - conclude Luca Pappalardo - ci faremo portavoce delle realta giovanili presenti sul nostro territorio. Raccoglieremo ogni proposta utile a sviluppare nuove strategie di innovazione e rinnovamento soprattutto per quanto riguarda i centri di aggregazione, in particolare delle strutture sportive, cercando soluzioni per il miglioramento di quelle gia esistenti e, perche no, anche di nuove costituzioni attraverso la formula di partnerariato tra pubblico e privato". Nelle prossime ore i coordinatori di "Alleanza Puntese" lanceranno un sondaggio sui social aperto a tutti per scegliere il logo rappresentativo del comitato civico alle prossime elezioni amministrative locali.

One of the top football teams in Brazil came out to play its first game back carrying a banner objecting to playing the game.
 “A good protocol is one that respects lives,” the banner read.
 Before the game in Rio de Janeiro on Sunday, most of the Botafogo players had posted a statement on social media protesting the return of football.
 “Football is our life, but we understand the moment is not ideal to put new lives at risk,” it said.
 Brazil has become a hot spot for the coronavirus, passing the 1 million mark in cases, second to the United States. President Jair Bolsonaro has declined to wear a mask and repeatedly played down any danger.
 A second top team, Fluminense, also played Sunday despite misgivings. “Thousands of people are still dying in Brazil, and we’re forced to play football with no protection,” the team’s chairman, Mario Bittencourt, wrote before the game,
 The two teams have been vocal opponents of returning to play, threatening earlier in the month to boycott the resumed season, before backing down.
 Botafogo beat Cabofriense, 6-2, and Fluminense lost to Volta Redonda, 3-0.
 Liverpool Fans: Celebrate Safely
 After Liverpool clinched its inevitable but long-delayed Premier League title, Manager Jürgen Klopp shared his delight with fans in a heartfelt letter published in The Liverpool Echo.
 “I have never before written a letter to a newspaper,” he said. “The actions and achievements of the players speak for themselves. All of the tributes that they have received are so deserved, and as their manager I could not be more proud.”
 But amid the joy, Klopp also felt the need to admonish some Liverpool fans. A celebration Friday night included thousands of fans, despite the urging of authorities for them to stay home. A teenager was arrested, accused of throwing a firework and starting a small fire at the Royal Liver Building, a Liverpudlian landmark at the waterfront, possibly because it was lit up in blue, the colors of Liverpool’s rival, Everton, which has offices there.
 “What I did not love — and I have to say this — was the scenes that took place at the Pier Head on Friday,” Klopp wrote. “I am a human being, and your passion is also my passion, but right now the most important thing is that we do not have these kind of public gatherings. We owe it to the most vulnerable in our community, to the health workers who have given so much and whom we have applauded and to the police and local authorities who help us as a club not to do this. Please celebrate, but celebrate in a safe way and in private settings, whereby we do not risk spreading this awful disease further in our community.”
 (Carefully) Welcoming Back Fans in South Korea
 South Korea was one of the first places to bring back baseball. As soon as Friday, it may be one of the first places to bring back fans, too.
 Fans will be required to buy tickets with credit cards online, so they can be tracked, if necessary. Their body temperatures will be checked at the entrances, and stadiums will be limited to about a quarter of capacity, with fans spread throughout the stands. The league expects to ban cheering as a precaution against coronavirus spread.
 Until now, the games have been played in stadiums with banners featuring pictures of fans instead of the real thing.
 Football in South Korea is expected to follow suit beginning July 10.

The Cameroonian started the Merseyside Derby v Everton and looked excellent, but was out of the side that thrashed Crystal Palace last week, with Jurgen Klopp preferring Joe Gomez.
 Matip is a superb defender, especially alongside Virgil van Dijk, but one of his weaknesses is that he’s injury prone and he always misses a chunk of every season with an issue.
 This probably proves why we might need to bolster our backline this summer, especially if Dejan Lovren departs – which will only happen if a fair offer arrives.
 For now though, we hope Matip enjoyed his title celebrations and is back for pre-season – whenever that will be – so he can start the 2020/’21 campaign in full swing.
 Long-term, we’re sure Matip will be a red for many years to come.

MUMBAI - BENGALURU - Wimbledon’s cancellation due to the COVID-19 pandemic this year will have no major financial impact on British tennis, outgoing All England club Chief Executive Richard Lewis has said.
 The grasscourt Grand Slam was scheduled to start on Monday but was cancelled for the first time since World War Two in April.
 The All England Lawn Tennis Club (AELTC) said its spending plans would not have to be curtailed.
 “It won’t be severely impacted. If you have to cancel, it’s great to have insurance,” Lewis, who will step down as the CEO next month, told British media.
 “We’re still in a very good position, we’re financially very stable. British tennis is going to be pretty well protected.”
 However, Wimbledon would not have similar insurance cover in place next year, he added.
 “That’s impossible in the current climate,” he said. “When I started in 2012, there were some signs that things were not insurable, because of communicable diseases that had taken place, like Sars and swine flu.
 “In the immediate aftermath you can’t get insurance but fairly soon after that you can start to get insurance again, the market returns. So there won’t be insurance next year.
 “But just because we’ve made one claim, it won’t affect us in the long term.”
 The U.S. Open is going ahead as scheduled from the end of August while the French Open has moved to the end of September from May and Sally Bolton, who will succeed Lewis, said the AELTC would learn all they can from the tournaments.
 “We’ve got the U.S. Open and Roland Garros being staged later this year and we will be looking closely at what they do, working with the constraints they find themselves under and learning what we can,” said Bolton.

Though I didn't write the songs consciously hewing to a theme, throughout the album, there's a recurring motif of light in the dark -- headlights, porch lights, lighthouses, bolts of lightning, fireflies, and stars. Though the songs emerged out of personal stories, they all touch on universal emotions and experiences.”

According to the American Bankers Association, auto loan delinquencies were already at an eight-year high as of the fourth quarter, well before the pandemic fully hit the rest of the world. Though the auto market is nowhere near as large as the mortgage market, a wave of defaults would still put a hurting on bank stocks at a time when net interest income is falling and delinquencies are rising across the board.

 The campaign, a partnership with the Office of Highway Safety and Planning, will focus on impaired drivers and conclude July 19.

 A zero tolerance approach will be taken if a driver is found to be under the influence of alcohol drugs, medication or any other substance which impairs a driver's ability to safely operate a vehicle.
 The Ottawa County Sheriff's Office reminds drivers it is illegal to operate a vehicle under the influence of any intoxicating substance.
