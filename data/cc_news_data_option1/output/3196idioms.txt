It probably isn't a stretch to say that most of us are staying in and watching more TV than usual these days. Now, Google wants to rise to the occasion by making it easier to search for stuff to watch, whether that's a baseball game or your favorite terrible reality show.
 "Today we're adding new features to Google Search in the US to help you quickly find the live games you're looking for," reads a Google blog post from Satyajeet Salgar, Group Product Manager, Google Search. "And when the game is over, we're here to help you discover live TV shows or movies that you may like too."
 The way it works is simple enough. For sports, just search for your favorite NBA or MLB team to pull up a better-organized list of airtimes and channels for upcoming matchups, including a new "live on" section that shows the live TV options in your specific area. Support for other leagues is in the works, too, so it's a good bet that you'll be able to Google NFL games next month, as well.
 As for TV shows, just type the name of whatever it is you want to watch to see when it's on next. If you don't know what to watch, you can just search for "what to watch" to pull up a carousel of channels, with preview thumbnails of everything that's currently live.

As with any old school FPS worth its salt, mobility is essential; if we stop we are sold to enemy fire, with which to take advantage of the abilities of our protagonist and the design of the environments become fundamental aspects to succeed in each encounter, which are constant. It is at this point when we detect some uninspired levels, with very simple designs and that sometimes play more against us than anything else. Another aspect that stands out and not for the better, precisely, is the small number of phases, up to a total of seven. And is that depending on our skills at the controls and the chosen difficulty, we can complete the game in the blink of an eye, or what is the same, in just over two hours. So much so, that the feeling when defeating the first and only great boss of the game will be "already?".

A special commission of inquiry's report into the ill-fated disembarkation of the Ruby Princess cruise ship is set to be handed to the NSW government.
 The Ruby Princess, which docked at Sydney's Circular Quay on March 19, has been linked to hundreds of cases and more than 20 coronavirus-related deaths across Australia.
 The ship - which was low on medical supplies and swabs for on-board COVID-19 tests due to shortages - left Sydney on March 8 for New Zealand and returned 11 days later.
 Despite the respiratory symptoms of numerous Ruby Princess passengers and the uncertainty surrounding COVID-19 test results, 2700 passengers were permitted to disembark as the voyage had been deemed "low risk" by NSW health authorities.
 This is because only 0.94 per cent of people on board presented to the ship's medical centre with flu-like symptoms - not the one per cent required to mandate NSW Health intervention - and none had visited virus-hit countries China, Italy, Iran or South Korea.
 Passengers disembarked before the results of 13 expedited COVID-19 tests were known - which would later show at least three people had the virus.
 Hundreds of virus-affected Ruby Princess crew members were then stranded off the coast of southern NSW before the ship departed for the Philippines in late April.
 Bret Walker SC was tasked with examining the ship's departure, arrival and disembarkation and conducted 21 days of hearings from April to July.
 He looked at the actions of Ruby Princess crew and ship operator Princess Cruises, as well as NSW Health, NSW Police and federal border and agriculture authorities.
 Mr Walker will on Friday submit his report to Premier Gladys Berejiklian and Governor Margaret Beazley, with the government to have final say on its date of publication.
 Separate NSW police and coronial inquiries into the Ruby Princess remain underway and are not expected to report back for at least another month.
 Federal Labor's home affairs spokeswoman Kristina Keneally on Thursday lashed the federal government for what she saw as a failure to cooperate with Mr Walker's inquiry. Federal officials were not permitted to give testimony in person.
 "It was the cause of our biggest outbreak until we had this wave in Victoria and the reality is when it comes to accountability, this prime minister is nowhere to be seen, he's pointing the fingers at other people, ducking the responsibility," Senator Keneally told Sky News.
 Prime Minister Scott Morrison has previously denied being uncooperative, saying "we would cooperate with the inquiry as we have with other inquiries".

The title puts us in the shoes of Hellgore, a rude, stereotyped soldier who seeks revenge against the hordes of monsters that have invaded his world and annihilated his loved ones. Although as he admits, that is enough, it is already "enough introduction, let's go!" And it is that following to the letter the null argument of this kind of games, Hellbound launches us into action without further ado, ready to wipe out every demon and creature of hell that comes our way, everything is said, to through a very scarce variety; although we will go into it later. For now, Hellbound presents all his cards from minute one, serving the player everything he has to offer throughout his next few levels.

 Its mechanics are as simple as you would expect from a title based on the 90s FPS; in this sense he is not fooling anyone. The movement is agile and invites us to distribute lead from the first steps, to which we must add the classic health points, shield, power-ups and a series of weapons that we will unlock as we overcome levels, up to a total of 5 different ones, to truth be told, a somewhat scarce number. From a spiked club to a couple of shotguns, through a kind of grenade launcher and a rocket launcher, all of them with a diabolical aspect. Of course, each weapon allows a secondary action or shot, something that adds a little more strategy to shootouts.

You've probably heard of detectives profiling killers based on the location of a body, but until now it's never been done the other way around.
 In a world-first study, James Cook University PhD student Jim Whitehead is profiling murders in a bid to find other victims.
 "If I know the offender and victim, their relationship, height and weight proportions, locality et cetera then some predictions can be made about the disposal methods and locations," he said in a statement on Friday.
 Analysing data from 729 homicide cases in Queensland, the Brisbane-based researcher found there were some similarities on body locations.
 He noted there was consistency across cases including distance from the murder site, distance from a road or walking track, and the direction bodies are taken for disposal.
 "The relationship between the offender and their victim also has a big bearing on disposal methods, but there's also often very little thought put into it," Mr Whitehead said.
 The student said his analysis will help give closure to grieving families and potentially put more murderers behind bars.
 "From a criminal justice perspective, it is difficult to prove murder without a body, and therefore difficult to prosecute and secure a conviction," he said.

The fortunes of private prison companies have become increasingly intertwined with the nation’s politics in an era when the Trump administration has been detaining tens of thousands of immigrants and asylum seekers at their facilities. Together, CoreCivic and GEO Group made about $1.3 billion last year in contracts with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Each company relies on ICE for around 30% of its revenue.
