Zimbabwe: Balancing Adolescents' Right to Protection, Health in Light of the Marriages Bill

Let me say from the on set that I totally subscribe to the notion of freedom of expression but in exercising one's freedoms and rights one must always be careful not to step trade on other people's freedoms and rights. A fine line which, if crossed, turns yesterday's liberator into today's oppressor. Some people are making a habit of criss-crossing the line willy nilly.      "As MLF (Mthwakazi Liberation Front), we would like to warn Jenni (Williams) that, whether she is into the so-called Gukurahundi Resolution chamber through bedroom relations with Mnangagwa or she received bribes from Zanu, she should always bear in mind where this will all end," said a statement from MLF.      "She must start considering a residential shift from Mthwakazi to Zimbabwe. If she wants to stay in Mthwakazi, we advise her to keep away from the gukurahundi issue because we cannot sit and watch her and her Matabeleland Collectives, a Zanu project, striving to let the perpetrators of the killings of our people walk scot free.      "For starters, Jenni is unqualified to sit in the resolution chamber, representing Mthwakazi people on basis that she knows nothing about the pain that Mthwakazi went through during the Gukurahundi era and the pain that she still reels in today."      This is the threatening and posturing the people of Zimbabwe have heard these last 40 years from Mugabe and now Mnangagwa and the rest of the Zanu PF thugs. Anyone who dares say anything critical of Zimbabwe much less Zanu PF is labelled a traitor and a puppet and is subjected to all manner of harassment, physical abuse and many have even been murdered in cold blood.

In addition to securing factional support and votes among the rank and file, a party president must be seen to have enough popularity among voters in order to win national elections. Abe ticked both boxes, although in some cases, like former Japanese prime minister Junichiro Koizumi, high popularity among voters mattered more than factional support.

The coolest thing that came out of it all is that our community stepped up to say, ‘We have people in need. What can we do?’ Churches of many denominations, groups who didn't always see eye to eye, tribal entities and non-tribal entities—all these groups said, 'We're in,’ and they _were_ in for the whole two and a half months.”

Exactly what it means to be “there” in a time of pandemic is a question that floats philosophically over this year’s presidential campaign. The Trump campaign chided the Democrats for not having their formal nomination in Milwaukee. So they made it a point to have a few hundred Republicans, six delegates from each state, come to Charlotte — the convention city Trump walked away from a few months ago — to sit in the Richardson Ballroom of the Charlotte Convention Center at six-foot tables and be “there” for the vote. They were heard, but not seen, as the convention secretary went down the roll of the states.

The spike in cases — alongside a resurgence of the virus in Europe — prompted fears of a second wave. But top experts have insisted the rise is merely down to more testing in badly-hit areas.
 It comes after separate government figures yesterday revealed more people are dying than expected in England and Wales for the first time in two months.
 Data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) revealed 9,392 fatalities were recorded between August 8 and August 14 – around 300 more than average for that time of year.
 But experts have blamed Britain's 10-day heatwave, which saw temperatures soar to 96°F (35.7°C), for the spike in deaths because the number of Covid-19 victims dropped once again.
 Only 139 deaths were blamed on the coronavirus over the seven-day spell, the lowest weekly toll since before the lockdown was imposed on March 23.
 For comparison, deaths from flu and pneumonia were seven times as common – with the illnesses mentioned on 1,002 death certificates during the same week.
 In other developments to Britain's coronavirus crisis today, more than 20 of the UK's biggest employers said they have no plans to imminently bring all staff back to the office full-time.
 A study found this week that British workers are the most reluctant in the whole of Europe to return because of fears of a second wave of coronavirus.
 Employers are currently hamstrung by social distancing restrictions which leaves many unable to fit everyone in, and even if they do, some staff may not feel comfortable returning until a vaccine has been found.
 This has now been followed by a survey of dozens of major businesses, in which 24 of the 50 asked by the BBC admitted not having any plans in place to get back to the office. None were named in the research.
 Accounting and consultancy firm PwC said a 'crowd mentality' was seeing staff begin to trickle back to work, but economists have warned a more widescale return is likely to be an 'uphill struggle'.
 Teachers today warned Boris Johnson his face masks U-turn risks creating chaos in schools amid fears pupils will bully each other over their choice of covering.
 The Government last night announced that face masks will be compulsory in the communal areas of secondary schools in parts of England which are subject to local lockdowns.
 Meanwhile, a decision on whether to wear face masks in non-lockdown area schools will be left to individual head teachers.
 The change in policy came after days of ministers and Downing Street insisting there were no plans to change the guidance in England which had said masks were not necessary if all other hygiene measures were adhered to.
 But Mr Johnson's hand appeared to be forced after Nicola Sturgeon said secondary school pupils in Scotland will be required to wear a mask when travelling between lessons.
 The timing of the U-turn has prompted anger — schools in England are due to reopen next week — with teachers warning the wearing of masks could cause 'mayhem'.
 They have cited fears of bullying, of pupils wearing dirty reused masks and of it being harder to challenge bad behaviour in corridors because it may be unclear which children are responsible.
 Teachers also said they had been left 'dizzy from all of the U-turns that have happened this summer'. The eleventh-hour change in tack followed new advice from the World Health Organisation at the weekend.
 Gavin Williamson today insisted he did not force the boss of exam regulator Ofqual to resign in the wake of the Government's A-level and GCSE results debacle.
 Sally Collier quit her role as chief regulator yesterday and Mr Williamson has denied that he made her carry the can for the exam chaos.
 Meanwhile, the Education Secretary suggested he had never considered quitting his own role despite widespread calls for him to step down over his handling of the row.
