ENGLEWOOD, Colo. (AP) — The most impressive part of Bradley Chubb’s comeback from a torn ACL that culminated in his tearful reaction to a Pro Bowl berth this week is that he did it with Von Miller on the sideline. “I just think he had a great season. His sack numbers and hurries and hits, those things were ranked really high as a total,” Broncos coach Vic Fangio said Wednesday. “Obviously, the more pass rushers you have in there, it helps everybody. We definitely missed Von, Bradley missed Von.” It wasn’t just Miller’s absence. Defensive linemen Jurrell Casey and Mike Purcell went on IR in October and Shelby Harris missed a month with a COVID-19 infection. Despite playing alongside a bevy of backups and dealing with constant double teams, Chubb ranks fourth in the league with 7½ sacks and 60 quarterback knockdowns and hurries. “It’s just a testament to the type of player he is, the way he works, the way he goes about his business,” safety Kareem Jackson said. “He’s a great leader for our defense and just in Year 3 he’s a huge piece to this puzzle here. “For me, it’s no shock that he made the Pro Bowl and is putting up the numbers that he is on a weekly basis.” Nor is it surprising to Fangio. “I just think he played great in spite of all the obstacles he had to overcome,” Fangio said. Chief among them was Chubb’s balky left knee that he injured last year, ending his 2019 season after just four games. It was still bothering him during training camp this summer and even into the season, which began with a sackless September. Miller’s absence was another big complication in Chubb’s comeback. Miller appeared primed for a big season before a freak ankle injury six days before the opener sent the franchise’s all-time sacks...

INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Indiana casino regulators voted Wednesday to force a longtime heavyweight in the state’s gambling industry to give up his ownership stake in a Lake Michigan casino, saying he had continued exerting control over its parent company in violation of state orders. The Indiana Gaming Commission’s action against former Spectacle Entertainment CEO Rod Ratcliff follows a federal investigation into allegations of illegal campaign contributions by a business partner. It also casts doubt over Indianapolis- based Spectacle’s construction of a new $300 million casino in Gary in partnership with Hard Rock International. The commission’s board members also voted for a 90-day emergency suspension of Ratcliff’s state casino license and gave him until Jan. 8 to turn over to a trustee all his stake in the company that owns the Majestic Star casino. Ratcliff’s attorneys argued against the actions, telling the commission that Ratcliff had reached an agreement to sell his ownership stake to Greg Gibson, a Spectacle partner not implicated in the federal investigation. Attorney Steve Grimes maintained that Ratcliff was willing to step away from the company even though he’s not been charged with any crimes and denies wrongdoing. State regulators had ordered Ratcliff to have no control over Spectacle after he resigned as chairman and CEO in June. That followed Ratcliff and Spectacle vice president John Keeler giving up their ownership in the company’s planned $125 million casino in Terre Haute to Gibson after Keeler faced allegations of illegally funneling corporate money to a former state lawmaker’s unsuccessful congressional campaign. Executives of Hard Rock International objected to Ratcliff’s sale deal, saying it appeared he would continue to have sway over Spectacle as a large creditor. Jon...

DENVER (AP) — Colorado has started vaccinating correctional workers as the coronavirus continues to spread in its prisons. Correctional facility workers received COVID-19 vaccines on Tuesday, and more staffers were scheduled to receive their initial doses on Wednesday, corrections department spokesperson Annie Skinner said. She did not immediately have a tally of how many workers had received the shots. It wasn't clear whether guards were among the workers being vaccinated yet or if medical workers were getting the shots. Meanwhile, Gov. Jared Polis on Tuesday commuted the sentence of four prisoners, including an 84-year-old man the American Civil Liberties Union has been pushing to have released because of his increased risk of severe complications should he contract COVID-19 behind bars. Anthony Martinez, who uses a wheelchair, will be released on parole on Jan. 15 under terms to be set by the parole board, Polis said. \"While his case highlights the need for reforming the state’s special needs parole process for him and others like him, at least I am able with my power as Governor to be a last recourse to allow him to live his final years with his niece in Pennsylvania,” Polis said. Under the state's vaccination plan, health care workers in close contact with patients with COVID-19 and workers and residents of nursing homes have received top priority in getting Colorado's first vaccination doses in the first half of phase one. The second half, phase 1B, includes correctional workers, police officers, firefighters and EMS workers. They are scheduled to also get the vaccine this winter, but no details have been released about exactly when. “There are doctors, there are nurses who provide clinical care in our correctional settings and they would be part of (phase) 1A as clinicians doing high contact...

Tampa Bay Lightning winger Nikita Kucherov is expected to miss the entire regular season because of a hip injury that requires surgery. General manager Julien BriseBois ruled out Kucherov on Wednesday for the 56-game season that begins Jan. 13 and ends May 8. Kucherov played through a groin injury in the playoffs on the way to helping the Lightning win the Stanley Cup in late September. He complained of the hip problem in early December. Losing the 2019 NHL MVP and leading scorer from the 2020 playoffs is a major blow to the defending champions, but they’ll be able to use long-term injury relief from Kucherov’s $9.5 million salary-cap hit to re-sign their final key restricted free agent, center Anthony Cirelli. BriseBois said Tampa Bay had the framework of a contract in place with Cirelli. Kucherov, 27, had a postseason-best 34 points on seven goals and 27 assists in the NHL bubbles in Toronto and Edmonton, Alberta. He led the league in scoring with 128 points in the 2018-19 season to earn Hart Trophy honors. The Lightning are making the most of the bad injury news by getting other signings done this week. On Tuesday, they re-signed Erik Cernak to an $8.85 million, three-year deal and brought back fellow defenseman Jan Rutta for $2.6 million over two years. On Wednesday, they re-signed forward Mathieu Joseph for $1.475 million over two years and Alex Volkov for $700,000 this season. Without Kucherov's injury, Tampa Bay likely would have needed to trade a key player to get under the $81.5 million salary cap that's flat in light of the pandemic. The team put veteran forward Tyler Johnson on waivers in October to clear his $5 million off the books, but he went unclaimed by the league's other 30 teams. ___ More AP...

NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — Tennessee's new online-only sports betting program saw $131.4 million in gross wagers last month, yielding almost $2.4 million in privilege taxes for the state, officials said Wednesday. According to a Tennessee Lottery news release, sportsbooks made $118.2 million in gross payouts in November, the first month of sports betting in the state. Eighty percent of the tax revenue goes into an education account that mostly funds post-secondary scholarships. Fifteen percent goes toward local government needs and 5% funds gambling problem treatment programs. Legislative backers have said Tennessee sports betting could yield $50 million in tax revenue annually. “November’s figures include adjustments and indicate potential,\" Rebecca Hargrove, Tennessee Lottery CEO, said in the release. “It is only one month in an unpredictable and extraordinary year, making it difficult to begin extrapolating out from this single month.” The Nov. 1 kickoff of sports betting came more than a year and a half in the making. Sports betting barely passed in spring 2019, and Republican Gov. Bill Lee let it become law without signing it due to his opposition to more gambling in a state without casinos. After the law took effect that summer, plenty of legwork followed for the lottery, which was tasked with coming up with rules and vetting operators and others looking to get into Tennessee’s industry. Now, the lottery regulates how sports betting is carried out. So far, Tennessee Action 24/7, FanDuel, BetMGM and DraftKings have approval for Tennessee sportsbooks. Others have since applied.
