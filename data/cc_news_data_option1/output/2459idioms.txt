BRAINTREE --Rob Melchionda looked out at the candlelit crowd gathered in tribute to his mother Laurie and had a message for her.
 "If love could have saved you, you could have lived forever," he said.
 Then he, along with his father Bob, brother and sister engaged in a group hug on the stage set up on the French's Common outfield.
 Police estimated more than 1,000 people attended Monday night's candlelight service celebrating the life of Laurie Melchionda, a member of the town's board of health, nursing director in the Weston schools and a longtime nurse in the Braintree school system. She was shot and killed Wednesday at her Howie Road home by a former neighbor posing as a delivery driver. Her assailant was arrested within minutes and has been charged with her murder.
 The vigil isn't the only tribute to Melchionda. On the columns flanking the town hall entrance, on the lampposts along Washington Street and on houses and utility poles in the neighborhood where she lived, there were purple ribbons. Purple was Melchionda's favorite color.
 "Ma, you actually got to redecorate the town," her son Rob said.
 Anthony Melchionda thanked the community for the "incredible" support the family has received since the incident.
 He said she pushed he children to be their best.
 "She was a force for good in the world. And that's what we'll continue to do," Anthony Melchionda said.
 Daughter Julianna said her mother inspired her to become a nurse in order to care for others.
 At the end of the hour-long ceremony, Melchionda's mother Mary Ellis stood on the stage and blew kisses to the departing crowd in gratitude.
 Speakers talked of the compassion Melchionda showed, how hard she worked, how hard she fought for the things she believed in and her love of family.
 Mayor Charles Kokoros, just recovered from a case of COVID-19, described Melchionda as an "incredible woman."
 He recalled when a recreational marijuana facility was being proposed in town. Melchionda spent countless hours convincing town officials to reject it.
 "She said no, so we said no," the mayor said.
 "The positive impact she had on all of us will live in our memories forever," Kokoros said.
 Paula Dowd, a former nursing director for the Braintree schools, said that for 25 years while Melchionda as a school nurse she also worked full-time as a nurse at Children's Hospital in Boston.
 "She loved being a nurse and always gave 110 percent in every aspect of nursing," Dowd said.
 Robyn Houston-Bean, who organized the vigil, worked with Melchionda on the town's substance use task force.
 "It's not just Laurie's family that is effected by her death, but the whole community, " Houston-Bean said.
 Former Mayor Joseph Sullivan, who appointed Melchionda to the health board in 2016, said she worked on countless matters involving the schools and played a key role in the permanent closing of the troubled Motel 6 on Union Street.
 He said the vigil is not a good-bye and that Melchionda will always be remembered by those she worked with in town.
 Attending the vigil were a group of Melchionda's classmates from Monsignor Ryan Memorial High School in Dorchester. The class held its 40th reunion last year and Melchionda hosted the planning meetings. One of the classmates, who did not want her name used, said she talked to Melchionda the morning she died. She said Melchionda was excited about spending more time at her New Hampshire vacation home during the summer school vacation.
 A wake for Melchionda will be held from 4 p.m. to 8 p.m. Wednesday at the Peck Funeral Home, 519 Washington St., Braintree. The funeral Mass on Thursday at St. Francis of Assisi Roman Catholic Church will be private due to the coronavirus pandemic.

RISING SUN — A traffic stop in downtown Rising Sun led to investigators confiscating a loaded handgun – which had been reported stolen in Wilmington, Del. — and plastic baggies containing suspect cocaine, methamphetamine and marijuana, according to Cecil County District Court records.
 Investigators identified the suspect as 28-year-old Jonathan Munoz-Martinez, a Wilmington, Del., resident who was arrested at the traffic stop scene.
 Munoz-Martinez is facing eight criminal charges, four of which are felonies, including possession of methamphetamine with intent to distribute, possession of cocaine with intent to distribute and possession of a firearm in a drug trafficking crime, court records show.
 The other charges against him include misdemeanor counts of possession of a stolen firearm and illegal possession of a firearm because, according to charging documents, Munoz-Martinez is prohibited from possessing a gun “due to an active protection from abuse order.”
 Scheduled for a July 20 preliminary proceeding, Munoz-Martinez remained in the Cecil County Detention Center without bond on Tuesday, one day after his bail review hearing, court records show.
 MPO Daniel Stickney of the Rising Sun Police Department stopped a maroon Chevrolet Tahoe driven by Munoz-Martinez at approximately 11 p.m. Friday on East Main Street for allegedly exceeding the posted 25 mph speed limit, after he had failed to stop before turning onto the road, police reported.
 As Stickney approached the driver’s side window, he detected an “overwhelming odor of marijuana” coming from the vehicle, court records allege.
 “While speaking with the operator, he continually moved about the passenger compartment, dropping his hands out of my line of sight,” Stickney alleges in his written statement of probable cause.
 Munoz-Martinez’ perceived furtive moves prompted Stickney to escort him out of the vehicle and to conduct a pat-down search, police said. During that search, police added, Stickney saw “numerous glassine bags sticking out of (Munoz- Martinez’) right rear pocket” and noticed “several large bulges in both his right and left pockets.”
 “During the pat-down search of (Munoz-Martinez), he did attempt to push off the vehicle away from me, at which time I placed him into custody pending further investigation,” Stickney outlines in charging documents.
 Stickney found and confiscated two plastic baggies of suspect cocaine during the pat-down search and an unspecified sum of cash, which the investigating officer described in court papers as a “substantial quantity,” police reported. Based on an evidence photo provided by the RSPD, it appears that the officer confiscated more than $2,500 from Munoz-Martinez.
 While searching the suspect’s vehicle, Stickney seized a digital scale, which he found in the driver’s side door pocket, police said.
 The officer also confiscated two plastic baggies holding suspect methamphetamine and two plastic baggies containing suspect marijuana while searching the rest of the vehicle, police added.
 (Charging documents do not indicate the weights of the suspect cocaine, methamphetamine and marijuana confiscated by Stickney.)
 In addition, according to court records, Stickney seized a second digital scale, which he found on a rear passenger’s seat, and a loaded 9mm Sig Sauer semi-automatic handgun, after finding it under the center console.
 That handgun had 11 live rounds in the magazine, according to charging documents, which further allege, “Routine checks revealed that the Sig Sauer semi-automatic handgun was reported stolen by Wilmington (Del.) Police.”

"We will be doing more testing," Fauci, infectious disease chief at the National Institutes of Health, pledged to a House committee conducting oversight of the Trump administration's response to the pandemic.
 The leading public health officials spent more than five hours testifying before a House committee at a fraught moment, with coronavirus cases rising in about half the states and political polarization competing for attention with public health recommendations.
 Fauci told lawmakers he understands the pent-up desire to get back to normal as the United States begins emerging from months of stay-at-home orders and business shutdowns. But that has "to be a gradual step-by-step process and not throwing caution to the wind," he said.
 "Plan A, don't go in a crowd. Plan B, if you do, make sure you wear a mask," Fauci said.
 Troubling surges worsened Tuesday in several states, with Arizona, Nevada and Texas setting single-day records for new coronavirus cases, and some governors saying they will consider reinstating restrictions or delaying plans to ease up to help slow the spread of the virus.
 Arizona, where Trump was headed for a rally at a Phoenix megachurch, reported a new daily record of nearly 3,600 additional coronavirus infections Tuesday.
 Arizona emerged as a COVID-19 hotspot after Republican Gov. Doug Ducey lifted his stay-home orders in mid-May. Last week, he allowed cities and counties to require masks in public places and many have done so.
 Texas surpassed 5,000 new cases for a single day for the first time — just days after it eclipsed 4,000 new cases for the first time — as America's largest pediatric hospital began taking adult patients to free up bed space in Houston. The infection rate in Texas has doubled since late May.
 Nevada surpassed a record one-day increase for the fourth time in the past eight days. Other states also were experiencing worrisome surges, including Louisiana, South Carolina and Utah.
 Another worrisome trend: An increase in infections among young adults. Fauci said while COVID-19 tends to be less severe in younger people, some of them get very sick and even die. And younger people also might be more likely to show no symptoms yet still spread the virus.
 If people say, "'I'm young, I'm healthy, who cares' — you should care, not only for yourself, but for the impact you might have" on sickening someone more vulnerable, Fauci said.
 About 2.3 million Americans have been infected and some 120,000 have died, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
 U.S. Rep. David McKinley, a Republican from West Virginia, asked if Fauci regretted that the American public wasn't urged sooner to wear face masks, then interrupted before the visibly annoyed scientist finished answering.
 Fauci said he didn't regret the change in recommendations. Early in the pandemic, there was a "paucity of equipment" for health workers "who put themselves daily in harm's way" and "we did not want to divert" those scarce supplies, he said.
 Scientists eventually recommended the general public use cloth masks after they better understood that people with no symptoms could be spreading the virus — even though they don't offer as much protection as the sophisticated masks reserved for health workers and are not a substitute for staying 6 feet away from other people.
 Trump, meanwhile, doubled down on testing claims that have public health experts appalled.

ELKTON — A woman caught with cocaine and heroin mixed with fentanyl after a traffic stop near Elkton in November was sentenced to time served – approximately six months – and then placed on three years of supervised probation Tuesday, after accepting a binding plea deal.
 The defendant, Maisie R. Lichtenfels, 26, of Elkton, pleaded guilty to possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, as part of the plea agreement and, in exchange, prosecutors dropped several related charges against her, including possession of heroin with intent to distribute.
 In accordance with the binding plea agreement, Cecil County Circuit Court Judge Brenda A. Sexton imposed a four-year sentence on Lichtenfels and then suspended all but about six months of it, representing the time that the defendant had served in the county detention center as a pre-trial inmate after her arrest.
 The judge then ordered Lichtenfels to serve three years of supervised probation, also part of the binding plea agreement negotiated by Assistant State’s Attorney Denise Williams and Assistant Public Defender Nicholas Cooksley, who represented Lichtenfels.
 Cooksley told the judge that Lichtenfels would be entering an outpatient drug rehabilitation program in Anne Arundel County on Wednesday morning and that, as part of it, she would be living at a recovery house. As part of the program, which includes group and individual counseling, Lichtenfels will be drug tested, he reported.
 “She’s been struggling with addiction,” Cooksley told Sexton, after noting that the binding plea deal and Lichtenfels entry into a drug rehabilitation program mark “a fresh start” for his client.
 The judge indicated that she would entertain granting Lichtenfels a probation- before-judgment finding if she successfully completes her three years of supervised probation, a modification that would clear this conviction from her criminal record.
 Should Lichtenfels violate probation, however, she could be sentenced up to three and a half years in prison – the part of her sentence that was not suspended.
 On May 5, Lichtenfels co-defendant, Mark Garland, 30, of the 400 block of Champlain Road near North East, received a three-year prison term after pleading guilty to possession of a controlled and dangerous substance with intent to distribute, as part of a plea deal, according to Cecil County Circuit Court records.
 Specifically, the judge imposed an eight-year sentence on Garland and then suspended five years of it. In addition, the judge ordered Garland to serve three years of supervised probation after completing his three-year term.
 Lichtenfels and Garland were arrested by Cecil County Sheriff’s Office Dfc. Joseph McCabe at approximately 10 p.m. on Nov. 8, after the deputy stopped a black 1995 Mercury driven by Garland in the 2400 block of West Pulaski Highway, police said.
 The deputy made the traffic stop because a 1995 Mercury is classified as an historic vehicle and, because of that designation, such a vehicle cannot be used “for primary transportation of passengers on a highway,” police added.
 A computer check revealed that Garland had a suspended driver’s license and that Lichtenfels, who was a backseat passenger, was wanted on a bench warrant for allegedly failing to appear for a court hearing in an unrelated criminal matter, police reported.
 There also was a front-seat passenger, a 25-year-old man, who was not charged in this case, court records show.
 At the outset of the traffic stop, Lichtenfels gave the deputies on scene a false name, according to prosecutors, who noted that investigators later determined her real identity when they found a booking photo of her on file.
 Brewer and his specially trained scent dog, Max, which alerted to the presence of illegal drugs while performing a perimeter scan of the Mercury, according to court records.
 That prompted a search in which investigators seized three pink containers holding crack cocaine, which they found under the driver’s seat that had been occupied by Garland, police said. In addition, police added, investigators found a ziplock baggie containing heroin mixed with fentanyl and bearing the street stamp “Mortal Kombat” inside Garland’s pants pocket.
 McCabe also confiscated a “bloody hypodermic syringe,” which he found on the floor beneath the right rear seat, close to where Lichtenfels had been seated, police reported.
 At that point, investigators arrested Garland, who was transported to CCSO’s headquarters near Elkton for further processing, police said. They also arrested Lichtenfels, whom deputies transported to the county jail for further investigation, police added.
 “Due to the hypodermic syringe in (Lichtenfels’) possession, Dfc. McCabe transported her to the Cecil County Detention Center to be strip searched by a female correctional officer for further contraband,” according to court records.
 During that search, the correctional officer found 21 baggies containing heroin with mixed fentanyl inside Lichtenfels’ bra, police said, adding that those baggies had the “Mortal Kombat” stamp, too.
 Also inside Lichtenfels’ brassiere, the searcher found a clear plastic bag containing slightly more than a half-ounce of crack cocaine, according to court records. The exact amount is listed in court records as 15 grams. There are 28 grams in an ounce.

SALT LAKE CITY — The journalist pushing for release of the police probe into Kerry Gibson is taking aim at his contention that the document, if made public, would violate his privacy interests.
 Gibson, a former Weber County commissioner whose duties in that role are the focus of the Ogden Police Department inquiry, has been fighting release of the two-year-old probe in a legal tussle that's now reached the Utah Supreme Court.
 Cathy McKitrick, the freelance journalist whose public records request for the document prompted the legal matter, maintains in her latest filing that privacy interests aren't germane in the matter. Gibson has argued against release of the probe, which was completed in 2018 and resulted in no charges of wrongdoing, saying, in part, that it could unfairly hurt his reputation and would represent an invasion of his privacy. The Standard-Examiner has also filed a records request for the investigation.
 "In terms of the public's right to know, nothing of importance turns on whether or not accusations of official misconduct are proven true or false. If a public official has abused his office, the public has a right to know. If investigators are using public funds to pursue investigations that are unwarranted, the public has a right to know that too," McKitrick's attorneys wrote in a brief filed on June 19. "And if a governmental agency declines to bring charges based on conclusions in a secret investigative report, the public has the right to know why."
 The police probe stemmed from accusations of misdeeds and ethical lapses under Gibson's leadership as county commissioner as brought up by county roads and public works employees in 2017 and 2018, former county officials familiar with the matter have told the Standard-Examiner. The Davis County Attorney's Office reviewed the investigation that resulted from the complaints, ultimately filing no charges and dropping the matter.
 Still, there has never been a full public accounting of the matter, and in her new Supreme Court filing, McKitrick says Gibson's protestations shouldn't be enough to sideline release of the investigation.
 That Gibson "disputes the allegations against him — something public officials do in almost every meaningful investigation — is no reason to keep them secret," the filing reads. "If that were the law, public officials would always be able to shield disclosure of investigations into their official misconduct, or at least tie them up in years of litigation, as Gibson has done here, simply by claiming that the accusations were unfounded."
 Gibson, one of four Republicans now running for the 1st District U.S. House seat, has said political opponents were behind the probe, though he hasn't provided additional details. He's also emphasized the fact that no formal charges emerged from the matter, saying his name has been cleared. Gibson, from western Weber County, previously served in the Utah House and headed the Utah Department of Agriculture and Food for about nine months before stepping down in January to run for the U.S. House.
 "More fake news. There is nothing new here," Gibson said in a statement on the matter to the Standard-Examiner on Tuesday. "Again, the fact of the matter is that absolutely no wrongdoing was found."
 All along, Gibson has objected to release of the investigative files "because they contain unfounded allegations against him in his role as a county commissioner," his lawyers wrote in a legal brief in the matter in May. "Release of Ogden city's investigative files will present a new round of defamatory allegations for Gibson to defend. The government's release of unsubstantiated allegations serves no public purpose."
 Also in her new filing, McKitrick countered Gibson's contention that he has legal standing under Utah's public records law to challenge release of the police report, one of the central legal questions in the matter. The Ogden Records Review Board on Sept. 6, 2018, called for release of the document with certain elements redacted, as sought by McKitrick. That prompted Gibson to sue in 2nd District Court in Ogden to block the move. McKitrick, in turn, filed a motion for dismissal of the suit, arguing Gibson has no leeway in state law to challenge the review board decision.
 The 2nd District Court judge issued a preliminary ruling last year in Gibson's favor, saying he has standing to sue in the matter, though that didn't resolve the case. But McKitrick subsequently asked for the Utah Supreme Court to review that decision. Following the filing of legal briefs by each side, the next step in the Supreme Court case would be oral arguments. That probably won't occur until September or October at the earliest, according to Jeremy Brodis, McKitrick's attorney.

Amid concerns of coronavirus clusters and efforts to stop the spread of COVID-19, and based on social distancing recommendations from medical professionals, schools across the country began to close their doors and adopt a remote learning model in March 2020. One of the largest communities affected was New York City, which closed schools across the five boroughs. The New York City school system is vast, with 1,800 schools servicing more than one million students.
 School administrators and educators quickly scrambled to find a workaround to meet children’s educational needs. Remote learning has been a part of many school curriculums for some time. While remote learning had predominantly been reserved for higher learning institutions, in the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak, it became a necessity for grades K through 12 as well. Teachers have had to design curriculums and assignments virtually on the fly in an attempt to minimize disruptions that could adversely affect students.
 Remote learning requires the cooperation of school staff and also parents and guardians. Patience is necessary, and parents and educators may need to completely transform their daily schedules. The following tips can be an asset as students continue to navigate remote learning.

Weber State University's study abroad program sent a strongly worded letter on Tuesday advising students they may have received a fraudulent acceptance letter to a study abroad program this summer in Switzerland.
 The problem is most WSU study abroad programs this summer are canceled. And, the university's travel guidelines say domestic and international travel shouldn't occur through at least July 31.
 It turns out the letter was part of a plan hatched by three students trying to hoodwink their parents into sending them to Europe.
 The letter, posted by WSU's study abroad program on Monday and addressed to students, indicated that several students might have received a letter from something called the "Weber Leadership Foundation" — a fictitious entity — saying they'd received a scholarship to attend a fake English program in late June and early July in Switzerland.
 The letter indicated the university was sending a cease and desist order and advised students not to give personal information or money to the organization.
 False alarm.
 A university spokesperson cleared up the situation on Tuesday, saying the students sent the fake study abroad letter to each other in hopes of convincing their parents to let them go to Europe for the summer and that the fake letter wasn't a scam and wasn't intended to raise alarm.
 According to WSU's study abroad website, many of the university's study abroad programs are canceled this summer. Some programs that are scheduled for later in the summer may end up happening, but it's a "wait-and-see" approach from the program.
 WSU is advising students not to buy plane tickets or pay for anything out of pocket regarding study abroad programs at this time.

Changing your environment can greatly improve your outlook. And that doesn’t have to cost a fortune. The key to great decor isn’t how much money you spend. It’s about seeing the possibilities in what you have already. You’ll be surprised at what you can do for little or no cost.
 USE WHAT YOU’VE GOT
 I have a friend who calls herself a professional arranger because people hire her to come to their homes and “redecorate” with the things they already have. She goes through every room, the attic and the basement, taking inventory of everything available for her designs. Then she completely clears the room and starts from scratch to furnish and decorate with only the things she found in the home. The results are amazing.
 If that triggered something in you that whispered, “I wish someone would pay me to do that,” check out the International Association of Home Staging Professionals. Or offer to do this for a few friends. Take before and after photos, and order business cards. You do not need a license or any particular certification to become a professional arranger.
 PAINT IS CHEAP
 Changing the color of one wall can change the entire mood of a room. One quart of paint is all you need. You can fool the eye with the way you use paint, making a room appear larger or smaller simply by changing of color.
 It doesn’t have to be an entire wall. Paint the inside of drawers, cupboards or closets a bright color to give yourself a fresh reason to keep that space organized. Cool colors and lighter tints make walls look farther apart; rich, dark colors bring walls dramatically closer, creating an intimate look in a large room.
 CONSIDER THESE TIPS TO MAKE THE JOB EASIER
 Check your local hazardous waste recycling center or the “Goof!” shelves in the paint department at Home Depot for free or low-cost paint. One reader painted her entire house for $45 using three low-cost, five-gallon buckets of brand-new but leftover high-quality construction paint.
 Use an old vinyl tablecloth as a drop cloth, or spend a buck for one at a dollar store. They are heavier than the plastic drop cloths at home centers like Lowe’s and Home Depot and will last for many rooms of painting. When you’re done, just hose it off and hang it over a clothesline or fence to dry before folding and storing.
 When you take off the outlet and switch the covers, put the screws back into the holes so they don’t get lost. Or put the covers and screws in a sandwich bag.
 Line your roller pan with a plastic grocery bag (inside out if it has printing on it) on the paint tray. Then you can just invert the bag when you’re done and throw it away.
 Clean your brushes with a dryer sheet. A glass jar works great for this. Stuff the dryer sheet into it, and then fill with warm water. Place the brushes’ bristles down into the water, and allow to stand for three to four hours. Rinse brushes well, and dry.
 STRATEGIC PLACEMENT
 The furniture you use most should be farthest from the entrance. If possible, avoid positioning couches, chairs, dining tables or desks against walls. Give yourself at least 3 feet between the furniture and walls. Check out these no- fail tricks for arranging furniture.
 PICTURES AND ART
 Most people hang pictures and art too high. The focal point for a single picture or the center of a group of pictures should be at eye-level for a person who is 5 feet, 7 inches tall. If that’s not you, I’ll bet you know someone who is that height.
 PLANTS
 Houseplants should be right for the light available in the area where you want to display them. Some easy growers that don’t require a lot of extra care include Philodendron and Boston fern.

These two may go down in history as one of the most iconic couples ever. For those who forgot, Harry and Taylor sent the internet into a frenzy when they were spotted cozying up on a Central Park date in 2012. After that, they were pretty much inseparable. The duo was photographed packing on the PDA all over New York City, wearing matching necklaces and get this — they even jetting off on a romantic getaway together. They’re two of Hollywood’s biggest stars, so seeing them together was seriously so epic. Unfortunately, they broke up in January 2013. The pair went on to write numerous songs about one another, including “Two Ghosts,” “Out of the Woods,” “Style” and more.

The Mattioli Foundation, in conjunction with Pocono Raceway, have established the Jimmie Johnson Legacy Scholarship for students pursuing professional skills at the Monroe Career & Technical Institute (MCTI.) This scholarship recognizes and celebrates the achievements of seven-time NASCAR Cup Series champion Jimmie Johnson. “Jimmie Johnson is a champion on and off the track,” said Nick Igdalsky, Director of the Mattioli Foundation and CEO of Pocono Raceway. “In addition to being one of the most accomplished NASCAR competitors of all time, Jimmie will go down as one of the best ambassadors our industry has had the privilege to know. Our extended Raceway family appreciates all he has done to support youth-based efforts to bring new fans into our sport, STEAM-related program for educators and students, and introducing inclusive initiatives, such as our infield playground, for those of all abilities to enjoy together. The establishment of this scholar ensures Jimmie Johnson’s legacy with live on within our community for years to come.” The Jimmie Johnson Legacy Scholarship will provide $4,800 to students at MCTI each year, for the next 23 years. This timeframe correlates to the number of seasons in which Johnson has competed in at least one NASCAR-sanctioned race. For each additional year in which Johnson compete in a NASCAR race at ‘The Tricky Triangle,’ the Mattioli Foundation and Pocono Raceway will add one additional year of support for this scholarship. Those eligible to receive portions of this scholarship include students who have demonstrated professional skills throughout their time at MCTI. Professional skills, as outlined by MCTI, teach and assess such things as attendance, work ethic, teamwork, etc. MCTI stresses these skills as a result of employers requesting to find strong, dedicated individuals for their respective organizations. “MCTI is excited and honored to be sharing the Jimmie Johnson Legacy Scholarship, afforded by the Mattioli Foundation and Pocono Raceway, to the deserving students of our school,” said Dennis Virga, Director, Monroe Career & Technical Institute. “MCTI strives to provide the high-tech career and technical training to students along with professional skills associated with their career field to ensure individuals are properly prepared to enter the workforce. Thank you!” To learn more about the Monroe Career & Technical Institute, visit www.monroecti.org. “I want to thank the Mattioli Family and Pocono Raceway,” said Jimmie Johnson, driver of the No. 48 Ally Chevrolet. “What an honor to know that the Jimmie Johnson Legacy Scholarship will be able to make a difference in the community for many years. Supporting education initiatives is important to Chani and me and is the focus of our foundation. It’s especially nice to know that this gift will help continue that mission and have an impact in the Pocono area. Thanks again to the Mattioli Foundation and track.” Pocono Raceway PR

It’s not just the money. JFK Terminal 1 is nothing like the Cadiz Water Conveyance Project, which in turn has nothing to do with the Baltimore to Washington MagLev project - much less with the Dallas/Houston High Speed Rail project in Texas. But these public works all have one thing in common - their ownership is creative, addressing our country’s infrastructure deficit outside of the normal public finance channels. Robust private investment in our infrastructure, adding energy and creativity to the current public model (now and for the next 3-5 years operating at a 30% deficit) will save the day, _and_ bring new solutions, discipline and genius to the design, construction and operation of the structures we need.
