This is expected to reflect in the growth of the Polylaminate Capsules market, as operations are limited to essential activities and products, thereby creating a huge void in packaging needs for non-essential commodities. On this premise, the global Polylaminate Capsules market will experience a downtrend through the pandemic. Further complicating smooth operations are hindered operations and travel bans across the world. On the back of these factors, players operating in the global Polylaminate Capsules market are expected to experience a steep decline in revenue flow.

_Old School Tactical_ from Flying Pig Games is a tactical combat system that is set in World War II to date. The game focuses on the simulation of small unit combined arms engagements where historical units, weapons, armor and vehicles will duke it out on a beautifully crafted board full of hexes. During a turn, players will go back and forth using an Impulse Point System to activate units to either Move, Assault Move or Fire. The players will play through a predetermined amount of rounds and at the end, victory points and casualty points will determine which side is the victor. The most recent volume in the series is _Old School Tactical Volume 3 - Pacific 1942/1945_ and includes battles between the Japanese and their Special Naval Landing Force and the American Marine Corps.

I have never played a historical wargame on the First Barbary War, which if you didn’t know was one of the first major wars the young United States of America participated in that was situated far outside their sphere of influence in North and South America. Shortly after the end of the American Revolutionary War, commercial vessels of the United States were being attacked and raided by the pirates of the Barbary coast in the Mediterranean Sea. In 1801, newly inaugurated President Thomas Jefferson was eager to put an end to this threat and sent a “squadron of observation” to the Mediterranean to deal with the threat.  _The Shores of Tripoli_  covers this conflict and does so using a card driven game mechanic that works really well in this instance. The game is a little deceiving, as at first it appears to be pretty introductory with simple rules and mechanics, but the depth for the game lies in the strategy for each side and the fact that their victory conditions are asymmetric.

Better still, she’s finally getting to talk about the film she made before lockdown hit – _Uncle Frank_. Written and directed by Alan Ball ( _Six Feet Under_ , _True Blood_ ), the ’70s set film follows 18-year-old Beth (Lillis) as she accompanies her gay uncle (Paul Bettany) on a road trip back to his homophobic family in South Carolina. Poignant without trying to be hard-hitting, and genuinely touching in its warmth and humour, it’s a nice change of pace for Lillis – even if she didn’t have any idea who Bettany was before she signed on.

The biggest controversy of them all came in 2009 when This Morning favourite Gino D'Acampo killed a rat.
 The celebrity chef was worried that his fellow contestants in the "exiled camp" were struggling with their limited food rations.
 So he took matters into his own hand and butchered a rat that he caught running around camp to serve up as a snack.
 "It's not done by choice but it's done because we need it," explained Gino in the Bush Telegraph.
 "We need some kind of protein, we need some kind of flavour. I saw one of these rats running around. I got a knife, I got its throat, I picked it up."
 Viewers were horrified by Gino’s admission and flocked to Ofcom to raise their concerns after he went into gory detail over how he butchered the rat.
 The group of celebs then ate the rat - and were surprised with how delicious it tasted.

“They’re pursuing a career in health care as a result of past work in facilities where they have developed a great desire to help people,” she said. “They never complain about the long hours they are working right now or the fact that they are sacrificing holiday time with their families due to the shortage of staff at these facilities.”
 Kelsey Nerison of Watertown is a certified nursing assistant who drives to Clear Lake to help out at Good Samaritan Society Assisted Living. A 2013 graduate of Watertown High School, she’s heard the questions about why someone just getting started in life would want to care for someone in their later years.
 “I had an argument with my cousin’s wife about what the job really involves,” she said. “I had to walk away because I got really mad. I just love to be able to help people who can’t really take care of themselves anymore. I love being there and being their second family, encouraging them to do everything independently as much as they can.”
 The COVID-19 pandemic has made her job even more difficult. It’s not only claiming lives at long-term care facilities. it’s also removing the one thing that really brightens the residents’ days — their families.
 “They’re pretty lonely,” said Jenna Jungwirth, a 2020 graduate of Mobridge High School who began working at Jenkins Living Center in June. “They miss their families, and phone calls aren’t enough for them. They also don’t like staying in their rooms. They’re not in contact with anyone.”
 Nerison saw an example of the heartbreak when, because of COVID-19 restrictions, a mother couldn’t hug her son who had come to visit.
 “It’s affecting me emotionally because the residents are all really depressed and missing their families,” she said. “Quite a few of them will cry because they can’t see their families like they did.”
 Cindy Ambrose, a 38-year-old student who commutes to Lake Area each day from Clark, knows at times she has to provide happiness where she can while working at the Avantara Nursing Home in Clark.
 “You’ve got to be cheery yourself and look for the good points and reassure them that we’re there for them and that they’ll be OK.”
 Jungwirth started working at a Mobridge facility her senior in high school. When it closed, she made the 41-mile round trip to another facility in Selby.
 “They can give me advice, too, and walk me through life,” Jungwirth said. “They’ve experienced most of the stuff themselves.”
 After she’s done with school, Ambrose works at Avantara until 1 a.m. three weekdays each week and adds in a 4 p.m. to 1 a.m. shift every other weekend. On school days she has to get herself to school as well as her three boys ages 15, 13 and 10. Her husband helps out.

Loeffler avoids explicit acknowledgements of Trump's defeat, but her message isn't subtle. "We are the firewall to socialism in America," she roared at one of the rallies with Pence.
 Neither Ossoff nor Warnock is a socialist, but Loeffler's hyperbole acknowledges that there'll be Democratic veto pen in the Oval Office. So, Loeffler said, "We are going to hold the line right here in Georgia."
 The balancing act extends through Trump's Cabinet. "I'm here because I stand with President Donald Trump," Pence declared in Gainesville, Georgia.
 The vice president, almost certainly a future presidential candidate himself, carefully parsed his words, declaring that a GOP Senate majority "could be" Republicans' last tool to protect "all that we've accomplished." Pence said nothing to counter the passions of crowds that erupted into chants of "Stop the steal!"
 Sonny Perdue, Trump's agriculture secretary and the senator's cousin, covered every base, perhaps clumsily. The former Georgia governor called Biden's name, unlike Pence, and warned against giving him "a blank check on America's values." Yet in the same speech, the secretary insisted "we're not going to give up on President Trump."
 The circumstances are precarious enough that many establishment Republicans, including Loeffler and Perdue confidants, decline to speak openly about it. The senators have not taken questions at their joint runoff campaign events, and neither campaign responded to an Associated Press inquiry on whether they recognize Biden as the incoming president.
 Trump is doing little to make his fellow Republicans' course any easier.
 The president has chastised Raffensperger, the Georgia elections chief, and Gov. Brian Kemp, himself a former Georgia secretary of state, on social media. Raffensperger has taken to the editorial pages of The Washington Post to defend his job performance and his conservative credentials. When Kemp announced his certification of the 16 Democrats who'll cast Georgia's electoral votes for Biden, the governor took pains to make clear it was a purely ministerial act required by law.
 Trump remains defiant even after losing round after round of court disputes and after the General Services Administration finally acknowledged Biden as president-elect, the legal step required for the federal government to begin the customary transfer of power.
 As recently as Wednesday, Trump retweeted hollow claims of a fraudulent election, and, in Georgia, his team's top lawyer, Lin Wood, fanned the flames.
 Wood tweeted that Loeffler and Perdue should demand that Georgia hold a special legislative session to review ballots and conduct a "legitimate" recount, despite the thorough one that was held, as a condition for getting the votes of Georgians in the run-off.
 Voters like Shaun Tracy are the targets of the muddled messaging.
 The 60-year-old came to see Pence, Loeffler and both Perdues, but made clear she was there because of her loyalties to the president. "There's just been too many irregularities and discrepancies going on," Tracy said, repeating the baseless assertion that Biden's victory is due to fraudulent absentee ballots, among other things. "They're trying to take our freedom away."
 Days later, David Perdue heard that refrain more directly.
 Standing in front of his campaign bus, the senator launched into his usual entreaty about the runoffs' importance. As Perdue spoke, a man in the audience cried out: "What are you doing to help Donald Trump?"

OCEAN CITY -- A Silver Spring, Md. man is facing numerous charges after a pair of incidents including allegedly defacing a restaurant's entrance and hours later leading police on a chase in the uptown area.
 Around 5 a.m. last Saturday, an Ocean City Police Department (OCPD) officer was on stationary patrol in the area of 124th Street when he observed a vehicle doing donuts from the highway into the parking lot of a motel in the area. According to police reports, the vehicle made passes in the roadway, traveled the wrong way and failed to obey any safety lines or markers.
 According to police reports, the driver, later identified as Scott Orellana, 44, of Silver Spring, Md., began screaming a series of expletives out the vehicle's open window along with, "I will kill you," and other unintelligible profanities. According to police reports, Orellana accelerated wildly out of the motel parking lot without stopping, entered the highway and drove north, all while screaming out of the vehicle's window in the officer's direction and flailing his arms and appearing not to be in control of the vehicle.
 According to police reports, it was clear Orellana was directing his vulgarities and profanity, along with his reckless driving, so the police would observe him. The officer attempted to follow Orellana, but he accelerated away and drove east on 126th Street. The initial officer lost sight of Orellana, but another OCPD officer located his vehicle in a parking spot on 125th Street near Wight Street.

SNOW HILL - Worcester County Public Schools will continue distance learning until Jan. 4.
 Though Worcester County's COVID-19 rates are currently trending in the right direction, officials last week extended the distance learning that was already in place another month. At the time, rates had increased to the level that worried officials.
 "As we have monitored the metrics around community transmission throughout this week, we are not seeing any indications of progress toward a significant decline or stabilization in these metrics," Superintendent Lou Taylor said last Thursday. "We have also consulted with our local health officials regarding current projections of spikes related to the upcoming holiday seasons. In light of this information, we have made the difficult decision to remain in Stage One - with all students engaged in distance learning - until January 4."
 This week, Worcester County's daily positive percentage has been trending down since reaching 7% on Nov. 16. As of Wednesday, the county's positive test rate was 4.19% (statewide 6.77%), down from 4.33% Tuesday. As for the seven-day moving average case rate per 100,000, Worcester County's had dropped to 13.12 Wednesday.
