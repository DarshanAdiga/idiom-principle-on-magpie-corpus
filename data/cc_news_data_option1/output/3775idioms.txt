It seemed certain to electrify both sides: Democrats were breaking fundraising records while a packed Trump crowd in North Carolina Saturday loudly chanted "Fill that seat." But it remained unclear if the high bench vacancy -- which could impact everything from abortion rights to legal challenges to the 2020 election -- would persuade disenchanted Republicans to return to Trump or fire up women or suburban voters to break for Biden.

Celia Cruz was unique. From her magnificent voice and charisma to her colorful wigs, nails, and outfits, the Queen of Salsa -- as the Cuban singer came to be known -- was hypnotic both on and off the stage. She was also beloved by people all over the world and gave back to her community in various ways. The Celia Cruz Foundation is a nonprofit organization that raises funds for underprivileged students who want to study music; the singer was also a big supporter of cancer patients, donating to the League Against Cancer and performing at fundraising events.

La Guarachera de Cuba is one of the most popular Latin artists of the 20th century. She made Afro-Cuban music and salsa -- as a member of New York's iconic band Fania All-Stars -- famous all over the world. Even though Celia was larger than life, she never lost her humble nature and her pride for where she came from.

But on Monday, Patrick Vallance and Chris Whitty went out just as a double act. Either because they didn’t trust the prime minister not to undermine the gravity of the situation – Boris hates being the bearer of bad news and can usually be relied on to make light of the situation – or because the government is paralysed and has no idea how to act on the new information.

And for the time being at least, seemingly above the pay grade of the prime minister. At a time of national anxiety that had just been ramped up several notches by the press conference, all the chickens were headless.

“Also, Brazil is apparently running out of beans to export and is slowing down their export program,” he continued. “And if Brazil is not exporting beans, or Argentina, we are plan B. That’s where you come. It’s not like there’s a whole list of countries you go to in order to get your soybeans from.
 “I’m guessing that Brazil and Argentina have made their sales and that’s good for us. Sales are good,” he added.
 As is the case with corn where good demand, coupled with some weather related issues, is helping with the rally, it’s similar for soybeans. But with both, Usset said it’s the good demand that best helps sustain a rally.
 “Strong exports, strong sales makes for a persistent market,” he said. “It’s been a wonderful rally.”
 The rally also makes for some good opportunities for producers who have struggled with low prices and lower demand when the U.S. and China were in the midst of a trade war.
 “My recommendation to producers is to say ‘do not just sit back and watch this.’ When you get an opportunity like this you’ve got to take advantage,” he said.
 “I’m not calling the high, I’m not saying it can’t go higher, maybe it can,” he continued, explaining that not only are current prices $1.60 off its lows, but they’re $1.30 over the prices back on Aug. 10 when November beans were at $8.60.
 “That’s in five weeks. You’ve got to wake up and take advantage of that, make a sale or two and hope to hell you’re wrong,” he said. “Hope to hell you’re griping at that university economist who tried to convince you to get something done because you’ll have more to sell.”

Beta was set to make landfall along Texas' central or upper Gulf Coast late Monday, forecasters said. It was then expected to move northeastward along the coast and head into Louisiana sometime mid-week, with rainfall as its biggest threat. Forecasters said flash flooding was possible in Arkansas and Mississippi as the system moves further inland.

Usset said he had to go all the way back to late November or early December of 2017, almost three years ago, the last time the price was as high was $10.05.
 “We just made a life of contract high in November beans. Now today we’re pulling back a bit, but it’s really an impressive move higher,” he said.
 Looking at local prices, at one local elevator in west central Minnesota regularly followed in this column, as of Sept. 15, the September cash price for soybeans was $9.26 and basis was -65 cents under. The December 2020 futures price was listed at $9.96 and basis was -7 cents under.
 The rally is being driven by a number of factors, including good export demand, some dry weather in some key producing areas like Iowa, and there’s even talk in parts of Minnesota that this crop is not going to be what it once could have been.
 “The demand is good. We’re back well over 2 billion bushels in exports. That’s good stuff,” he said, adding that sales to China are going well.

As with many Honda products, the Passport includes several thoughtful interior elements. Rear-seat passengers have access to a total of eight cupholders, and the ones mounted on the door armrests are especially useful for children. The second-row seats are heated in the outboard positions in all but the base grade and also fold very flat to create a level load floor for a total of 2,854 litres of cargo space with the seats down and an impressive 1,430 litres with them up. That said, the space back here is relatively dark due to the all-black interior and the smaller sunroof.

There is another potential wrinkle: Because Arizona's Senate race is a special election, that seat could be filled as early as Nov. 30. If Democrat Mark Kelly wins and is seated, that would narrow the window for McConnell.
