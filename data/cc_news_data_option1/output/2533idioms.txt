I was certainly not anticipating creating an entire identity for my child. I was just looking for a way to up the ante and get everyone excited and involved. And I have a flair for theatrics and love to throw parties – we had a party for the goldfish once. We have a blowout for the dog every year. I just kind of invented an occasion out of it.

McGriff’s teammates poked fun at his jump shot for all of his freshman season. In response, McGriff spent every single day, without fail, of the next summer sinking 1,000 shots a day. In his sophomore season, McGriff increased his 3-point percentage from 28.6 to 36.8 and his free-throw percentage from 73 to 86.5.

U.S. voters and policymakers must be very careful about the risks of a “Pyrrhic victory”— an overreaction that imperils openness, inclusiveness, and vitality at home and practical cooperation abroad. To be sure, there is much to criticize and abhor about the CCP’s behavior, from Xinjiang to Hong Kong to the pathologies of a political system that rewards shows of political loyalty rather than timely and objective feedback and reporting during a pandemic. But U.S. policymakers must be attuned to the costs and risks of overreaction, and retaliatory or reciprocal policies that hurt the U.S. more than China.

The United Nations, as an organization, is a direct successor to the failed League of Nations, its very name is reminiscent of that of its predecessor. On paper, both organizations should have been a community of equals. However, in practice, it's clear that great powers have more say in important issues than minor ones. At the same time, these very great powers also carry more responsibility to global well-being than small countries—and this fact shouldn't be overlooked. For example, the financial contribution of great powers to the UN, with its many projects relating to humanitarian issues, far exceeds that of the rest of the international community.

Led by general contractor Hausmann Construction of Lincoln, the project is nearing completion, with mainly interior finishes and exterior landscaping remaining.
 Some existing equipment has been moved into the building, and new items are starting to arrive. Faculty are expected to begin transitioning to Discovery Hall in July.
 “Everyone is excited to get in the new building,” said Tim Jares, dean of UNK’s College of Business and Technology. “Most of those from CBT who are moving into Discovery Hall are coming from Otto Olsen, so the change and improvement goes without saying. The new building truly is impressive.”
 Located on UNK’s west campus, Discovery Hall features a mix of modern and industrial design, with plenty of natural lighting and open areas where students can study and interact, including a rooftop garden. The three-story building offers spectacular views of campus.
 “Combined with the improvements we have planned for West Center, there will be ample space for students to spend their entire day on the west side of campus,” Jares said.
 At 90,000 square feet, Discovery Hall is about twice as large as the Health Science Education Complex that opened in 2015.
 The science, technology, engineering and math facility has lab and classroom spaces designed to meet each program’s specific needs while maintaining a level of flexibility for collaborative projects. Glass enclosures and balconies allow students, faculty and visitors to observe lab and instructional work from the outside the room.
 “In Otto Olsen, everything happened behind a closed door or wall,” McQueen said. “In Discovery Hall, everything is out in the open.”
 Discovery Hall will house programs from the industrial technology, cyber systems, mathematics and statistics, and physics, astronomy and engineering departments, creating a cross-disciplinary environment that promotes collaboration and innovation among the faculty, students and staff who share the space. A large, touchscreen video wall — roughly 4 1/2 feet by 20 1/2 feet in size – will allow for real-time interaction between people both on and off campus.
 A number of events showcasing Discovery Hall will be planned for later this summer and fall.

You’re worried the washing machine may be on its last spin cycle. It makes a horrible screeching sound and needs a lot of coaxing to make it all the way through a full cycle. Should you spend $319 to fix this inefficient appliance or replace it with a $999 new model that will use less electricity and water?
 Deciding whether to repair or replace your broken appliance — especially when trying to save money in the long run — can be challenging.
 Consider these basic guidelines, based on costs and advantages of both options, to help you decide.
