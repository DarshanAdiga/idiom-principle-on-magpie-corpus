SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Tensions between the U.S. government and Pacific Gas & Electric are boiling over as the two sides battle over whether a taxpayer- funded agency should be allowed to stake a claim on a $13.5 billion settlement covering most of the losses from catastrophic wildfires blamed on the bankrupt utility.
 The showdown came into sharper focus Monday when a top official from the Federal Emergency Management Agency blasted the nation's largest utility and fire victims' lawyers for negotiating a deal that could put the government in the untenable position of trying to claw back money it already has paid to people who lost family members and homes in fires ignited by PG&E's transmission lines from 2015 and 2018.
 Robert Fenton, a FEMA regional administrator, lashed out during a media conference call held after the San Francisco Chronicle first reported the agency planned to seek repayment of a portion of the $3.9 billion bill that it incurred in the fires from the victims if it can't get the money from PG&E as the utility scrambles to emerge from bankruptcy protection by June 30.

Missouri men's basketball opened Southeastern Conference play with lackluster offense its first two times out, scoring 59 points in a pair of losses.
 After the Tigers' outburst Saturday night against Florida, they would like to consider that lack of production a thing of the past.
 Missouri jumped out to a double-digit lead midway through the first half and never looked back for a 91-75 win over the Gators in front of an announced crowd of 9,001, which in reality was much slimmer due to winter weather swirling outside Mizzou Arena.
 The Tigers tied their previous season high for points in a game, with the other high-water mark coming Dec. 30 against Chicago State.
 Missouri improves to 9-6 overall and 1-2 in the conference. Florida falls to 10-5 and 2-1 in the SEC.
 "A tremendous effort. I think it was our best effort of the season," Missouri head coach Cuonzo Martin said. "... If shots go down, you're a different team. For most guys, when a shot goes in, they feel good and they play differently. That's what this was tonight."
 Missouri's Dru Smith and Florida's Kerry Blackshear Jr. tied for the individual scoring lead with 22 points each.
 Javon Pickett and Mark Smith each added 14 points for Missouri, among eight total Tigers who made a 3-pointer and scored at least six points.
 Missouri hadn't scored 91 points in an SEC game since a double-overtime contest against Texas A&M in 2014. In its first season in the league (2012-13), MU scored more than 91 points twice, wins over Mississippi and Arkansas.
 The Tigers shot 61.5% (32 of 52) from the field and 63.2% (12 of 19) from 3-point range in the runaway victory.
 "They were in a great rhythm for 40 minutes," Florida head coach Mike White said of Missouri. "... It wasn't our best effort, but I think Mizzou had a lot to do with that."
 Missouri played by far its best offensive half of the season during the first 20 minutes, scoring 51 points, the most MU has ever scored in a single half of an SEC game.
 Missouri made 8 of 11 attempts from 3-point range in the opening half while committing only four turnovers to lead by 15 at the break.
 Xavier Pinson, who finished the game with eight points, put the home crowd into a frenzy early in the first half when he made a contested, one-handed dunk.
 "To me, it was just getting the crowd involved, giving the crowd something worth their time for coming," the 6-foot-2 guard said. "I'm going to just dunk everything now."
 The Tigers eclipsed their final point total from the Kentucky and Tennessee losses on a Pickett layup with more than 16 minutes remaining in regulation.
 Missouri's next two opponents, Mississippi State and Alabama, are 1-5 combined in SEC play. The Tigers hit the road to face the Bulldogs on Tuesday night, then head to Tuscaloosa next Saturday for a matchup against the Crimson Tide.
 McKinney suspended
 Missouri freshman guard Mario McKinney Jr. has been indefinitely suspended from the team, the program confirmed.
 McKinney was still listed on the Tigers' official online roster as of late Saturday night. The St. Louis native played in seven games this season, averaging 2.6 points and eight minutes per appearance.
 "He's not a part of the team right now, so I'll leave it at that," Martin said of McKinney.

“FEMA doesn't deserve any of this money," Brenda Wright, a 2018 fire victim, wrote to U.,S. Bankruptcy Judge Dennis Montali in a recent letter. “Please man up and do the right thing for us.”
 California has no plans to seek any money from the fire victims even if it isn't fully repaid from the $13.5 billion settlement, Gov. Gavin Newsom's office said Monday.
 FEMA contends it is following its legal obligation to seek repayment for money paid in a disaster caused by a company or person. But that issue could boil down to whether the fires caused by PG&E stemmed from deliberate acts by the utility and its management or was a matter of negligence.
 The government agency said it will only ask fire victims for repayments of losses that they also recover from the $13.5 billion settlement. Figuring that out could be a complex process, besides a public relations nightmare.
 “We want to help people after a disaster," Fenton said. “The last thing we want to do is hurt them.”

GUWAHATI — Haryana struck a gold mine in the Khelo India Youth Games here on Jan. 13 to surge past Maharashtra to the top of the medals table.
 Pumped up by four gold medals in kabaddi, three each in archery and athletics and one each from cycling and gymnastics, they amassed 17 gold after Day 4 to catapult from Number 6 to Number 1.
 Maharashtra picked up only four gold to manage a tally of 16 to slip to the second position. They have a total of 71 medals, though, as opposed to Haryana's 47, to set up a thrilling race to the finish.
 The defending champions, Maharashtra, were well served by Aditee Ajit Dandekar (Girls Under-21 Individual all-Around rhythmic gymnastics) and their 4x100m relay quartet but they could only watch as Haryana went for the kill across sports.
 Haryana dominated kabaddi but were surprisingly taken to the wire by Himachal Pradesh in the Girls Under-21 final; the hill state, in fact, rallied from a six-point deficit at half-time to tie the score at 27-27 at the end of regulation time.
 Last year's runners-up Haryana had to dig deep into the reserves of their strength and experience to sneak home in extra time.
 Meanwhile, Tamil Nadu stole the limelight in athletics, with an equally impressive five-gold show; Kerala's Ancy Sojan too made an impact, anchoring her state's Under-21 4x100m relay squad to collect her third gold medal.
 Three of Tamil Nadu's gold medals came in jumps, through S Saran (Boys Under-21 long jump), Pavithra (Girls Under-21 pole vault) and Babisha (Girls Under-21 triple jump). Their gold tally has swelled to seven from track and field, taking them to the fifth place with 8 gold out of 25 medals. Delhi and Gujarat occupied the third and fourth spots.
 Haryana dominated archery too, winning 7 medals including 3 gold. Himani Kumari, who missed out on a medal in Pune last year, claimed the Girls Under-21 title with an easy win in the final. Tisha Punia, a quarterfinalist last time, beat her team-mate Tamanna in the Under-17 final while Ridhi took the bronze to ensure a sweep for them in this category.
 Madhya Pradesh's compound archers Muskan Kirar (Girls Under-21) and Chirag Vidyarthi (Boys Under-17) bettered their last year's performances to bag gold medals this time. Chirag Vidyarthi had to hold his nerve in securing a 1-point win against Rajasthan's Rajesh Bishnoi.
 Haryana cyclist Anil Manglaw secured the most comfortable victory in the road races held on Monday. Assam's Gongutri Bordoloi won the Girls Under-21 road race (60km) in a stirring finish that saw the podium finishers separated only by 0.15 seconds. Similarly, Delhi's Arshad Farid and Maharashtra's Pooja Danole outsprinted their rivals in the Under-17 races but only just.
 Gujarat's Rushiraj Jadeja, a student of the District Level Sports School in Ahmedabad, finished sixth in qualification but came into his own to win the Boys Under-21 10m Air Rifle gold from home favorite Hridhay Hazarika.
 Parth Makhija (Delhi), who topped qualifying with 630.6 finished fifth, three sub-10 shots hurting him.
 Rudraksh Patil (Maharashtra) took the other gold on offer in the shooting ranges on Monday, the 10m Air Rifle for Boys Under-17 with a consistent showing both in qualifying (627.2 points) and in the final where he beat Keval Prajapati (Gujarat) quite comfortably.
 Gujarat's judokas showed their growing prowess on the mat to win three of the eight gold medals on offer in the Under-21 competition. Seven of the state's 10 gold medals have come from the Judo competition. While Gujarat's sustained efforts to rake in medals hogged the limelight, Mizoram's Chinglinmawaii caught attention by winning the Girls Under-21 52kg class for her state's second gold in all.

Anderson and Graham then barricaded themselves in the supermarket and shot hundreds of bullets at law enforcement officers before they were killed in the gunbattle, Carpenito said. Both were wearing tactical gear.
 After the shooting, authorities found five firearms at the scene including an AR-15 and a shotgun.
 Inside the van, authorities found the improvised explosive device, a shopping list for tactical items, targets and notes for how to aim rifles from 50 yards away or more, Carpenito said. They also found a Bible, which had Rumberger's blood on it, a note on top of the Bible that said Anderson was a follower of the Black Hebrew Israelites and some anti-Semitic views, ballistic plates on the rear of the cab inside the vehicle, enough explosive materials to make another bomb, and two cell phones.
 A note found on Anderson's body had a quote that read "FBI's War on Black America," making reference to a documentary of the same name made in 1990. In particular, it referenced a part of the film that called for violence against law enforcement. It also contained a phone number and address to a pawn shop, also in New Jersey.
 Officials said there are no other current threats related to the case. While there are no co-conspirators or connections to a third party, Ehrie said, he lamented the difficulty in trying to find and prevent attacks by people such as Anderson and Graham, who were not known to law enforcement before the attack and were not tied to an organization or group.
 "A lot of these individuals, like Anderson and Graham, are off the radar. They aren't doing anything that would bring them to anybody's attention, whether that's by intent or whether that's just by their lifestyles, and then just something goes and they commit to an act like this. That is very, very difficult," Ehrie said.
 "There's no organization to look into," Ehrie said. "There's nobody to infiltrate. There's no undercover work we can do. There's no phone we can tap. There's no anything, our usual techniques to get inside the minds of these people."

Los jugadores vieron la cámara en vivo y, al decodificar las señas, golpearon el bote de basura con un bate, y a veces un Theragun, para indicarle al bateador qué lanzamiento se acercaba. Inicialmente, trataron de aplaudir, silbar o gritar, escribió Manfred, pero los jugadores determinaron que el bote de basura era el mejor uso para transmitir las señas.

 Travis Konecny scored in the fifth round of the shootout for Philadelphia, and Marchand lined up for his turn needing to score to keep the game going. The two-time All-Star charged toward the resting puck but barely nipped it as he skated past — he zoomed into the offensive zone, but the puck trickled forward just a few inches.

BAY ST. LOUIS, Miss. (WLOX) - An icon in the Magnolia state made his way to the coast Sunday night. Former Mississippi State Bulldog head baseball coach Ron Polk came down from Birmingham to share some of the lessons he has learned over the course of his life.Polk amassed more than 11-hundred victories in his coaching career. He also led a team to the College World Series six separate times. One way he did this was through sharing valuable tips about finding success on and off the field."He is such a first class man,” said former player Brad Corley. "He does such a good job explaining to these kids how the real world works, and what to expect after high school, [and] ways to be successful in what they are pursuing in their lives.”Corley works as an assistant baseball coach for St. Stanislaus, but he once was routinely taking the diamond for Coach Polk. Corley was critical in getting the legend down to the coast, and he knew the team could learn from his old mentor.“I feel like everyone got something from that," said sophomore Joseph Bradford. “I think everyone kind of locked in and realized that we could do whatever we put our minds to as long as we put other stuff away and just focus on what we need to get accomplished.”Bradford is also a star on the football team, but he was far from the only athlete that took something away from the event.“It was very inspirational for him to come out and just talk to us about the little things and have a funny side to it as well," said Ethan McNeill. "It gave us a really interactive way of learning.”The Legendary coach spoke for over two hours and made a point to not only shaking everyone’s hand, but to get to know them as well. Coach Polk is also slated to speak in Long Beach before the start of the college baseball season.Copyright 2020 WLOX. All rights reserved.

SAN ANGELO, TEXAS (TNN) - The 50th Annual West Texas Rehabilitation Center’s telethon is Saturday, January 18 and we’re giving you an inside look at how the non-profit is enriching people’s lives.For 67 years, the West Texas Rehabilitation Center has been providing therapy to patients across several states, and more than 150 cities across Texas. Located in San Angelo, Abilene, and Ozona, the facility offers care to people with disabilities, regardless of their financial circumstance.It’s made possible through fundraisers, like the upcoming telethon that allows West Texas Rehab to help anyone who walks through their doors.“The first thing our staff should be asking when they come in the doors is, ‘Do you need help paying your bill?’," said West Texas Rehab CEO, Steve Martin. "If they need help, we want to alleviate that burden upfront.”And with the telethon days away, we’re learning about a man getting stronger day by day with the help of physical therapy at West Texas Rehab. At 46-years-old, Luis Pena is learning how to walk again.“I had a stroke and then a few heart attacks," said Pena. "And just shock out of the blue, kind of a surprise.”He remained hospitalized for months, causing his muscles to breakdown. Pena knew he would have to regain his strength, but one part of his recovery included surgery that made it an even more difficult feat.“I had brain surgery, they removed part of my cerebellum," said Pena. "I don’t have my balance so I can’t walk.”What’s been a difficult journey for Pena is made easier by physical therapists, like Laura Wilson. She’s one of several Pena sees twice a week for about an hour a day for the last two years.“When he first came, he was in a wheelchair all the time,' said Wilson. "I don’t think he could imagine when he could walk into this clinic, and that’s what he does every day now. He walks in.”And its with state of the art equipment like the Zero-G Body Weight Support System that helps Pena improve every day.“When I first started, I use to stomp around like Frankenstein, so I think my steps have gotten better," said Pena.West Texas Rehab doesn’t stop until their patients reach their full potential, whether it’s through physical therapy, occupational therapy or speech therapy. In Pena’s case though, it’s all that and then some.“With Luis, he’s been able to work with our neuro team," said Wilson. "He’s gotten orthotics, treatment from an OT &amp; PT, Speech Therapist, a dietitian. We’re trying to come at it from all angles to help him heal in the best way and most full way.”Now, Pena is well on his way to achieving his goal of walking independently and shares the message of perseverance with others.“I’d tell them to keep working hard and don’t give up because, from where I came from, I can see the light at the end of the tunnel now," he said.The telethon is a five hour show that kicks off at 7 p.m. on Saturday, January 18. The phone lines are open until midnight. For more information, visit westtexasrehab.org.Copyright 2020 Texoma News Network. All rights reserved.

 The strike group was deployed to the U.S. 5th Fleet area of operations in support of naval operations to ensure maritime stability and security in the Central Region, according to the Navy’s public affairs office. The Central Region connects the Mediterranean and the Pacific through the western Indian Ocean and three strategic choke points.

Vistara has said it is serious about inducting an all-economy narrow-body aircraft into its operations in the near future. A full-service carrier with no business class? The news set tongues wagging.While the aviation market received the proposed change in tactic as a fresh development, truth is the airline inducted a A320neo (VT-TNN) in an all- economy configuration. Initially, the aircraft was flying on the Delhi&amp;ndash;Kochi sector; it now operates a double-daily flight to Ranchi and a single-daily one to Udaipur from Delhi.Vistara&amp;rsquo;s change of tack has triggered a debate about the viability of the model in a country where 82 percent of domestic market share lies with low-cost carriers (LCCs). Parallels were drawn with Kingfisher and Jet Airways &amp;mdash; both serving a stark reminder that they are not in operations anymore.&amp;#8203;&amp;#8203;Since inception, Vistara has been struggling to get the right mix for its aircraft. The airline started with 16 Business Class, 36 Premium Economy and 96 Economy class. Within a year of operations, the airline started re-configuring its aircraft to 8 Business, 24 Premium Economy and 126 Economy class seats.Twist in the taleIn 2018, the airline placed orders for additional narrow-body aircraft along with B787-9 Dreamliner wide-body aircraft. The twist in the tale came in April 2019, when Jet Airways suspended operations. All airlines in India have a large order book, except Air India. Yet, the government linked the additional slots distribution to immediate induction of additional aircraft. Spicejet became the biggest beneficiary of the same and inducted 30+ aircraft to get additional slots. While GoAir and IndiGo did not change its business plans, Vistara did and inducted 9 B737s which earlier flew for Jet Airways - as a stop-gap arrangement to get slots. Going by the airlines' in flight magazine for this month, two of the nine aircraft will be out of fleet this month.Currently, the airline has three class A320s, dual class B737s and a mono class A320 in operations. When the A321 is inducted, it will have another configuration due to its larger size.Vistara also has the economy Lite fares, wherein patrons have to purchase meal on board, creating confusion. A similar confusion was created with the upgrade vouchers for the flights operated by the B737 series. Since they are dual class, the airline permits an upgrade with two upgrade vouchers instead of one.Sub-Fleet: Not a new experimentHaving a sub-fleet is not an experiment any more. World over, airlines have the same type of aircraft configured in different seating configurations to match the demand to the market. Kingfisher Airlines operated a premium heavy A321 with 32 business class seats between Mumbai and Delhi. Likewise, Jet Airways operated multiple sub-fleets in the past.India is different and difficult! The unique Route Dispersal Guidelines, makes the route dynamics complex and puts a strain on the balance sheet. Not always does an airline find Business Class and Premium Economy class passengers on routes to Guwahati, Bagdogra, Dibrugarh or other points in the northeast, especially because there is overcapacity in the markets &amp;ndash; thanks to airlines being forced to operate flights as a percentage of their metro route deployments.An all- economy aircraft helps mop up additional ASKs (Available Seat Kilometres) on Category II and IIA routes by plying an all-economy aircraft and helps compete effectively with LCCs on such routes, where it is presumed that the loads in the front cabin are not sufficient. India is a cost-conscious market and non- metro routes are even more prone to cost fluctuations. This reducing the Business class and premium economy class, could also help the airline have a larger capacity share in these markets and help gain a little edge over competition, helping it to price competitively.Risks galoreHowever, this is fraught with risks. Vistara is now becoming a chosen airline in India for foreign FSCs operating in India. From equity partner Singapore Airlines to Lufthansa, and British Airways to JAL &amp;ndash; the airline is getting into a code share and interline agreement with multiple players across the globe.Globally, airlines have a sub-fleet, but it is easier in Europe where the Business class section is essentially the same seats with the middle seat empty and full meals inclusive. American Airlines, for example, operates the A321 in five different types of seating configurations. There are not many airlines which have a three-class service in Asia, but Air India has a couple of aircraft in all-economy configuration and so did Kingfisher AirlinesTail noteVistara is blessed to have a strategy and planning team, which has access to the best of TATA and Singapore Airlines. However, both Kingfisher Airlines and Jet Airways weren&amp;rsquo;t different.They had some of the best aviation consultants in the world at their disposal. With the confusion in seating and business model, there were cases of Kingfisher Airlines having two back-to- back flights on high-frequency route between Mumbai and Delhi being operated by a dual class and mono class aircraft, leading to confusion.When both these airlines moved to a mix model of LCC and FSC, there have been cases of onward flight being FSC and return being LCC creating more confusion in the minds of the people. Vistara is not trying any of this, thankfully.Yet, after experiments with seating configurations &amp;ndash; Jet Airways and Kingfisher Airlines returned to a single type of seating &amp;ndash; dual class, same across the fleet. For both Jet Airways and Kingfisher, it was too little too late, so the Indian market hasn&amp;rsquo;t seen the benefits of the re- configuration.Having such a sub-fleet does put a strain on operations, if not managed judiciously. There are times when you have delayed aircraft rotations, but inability to swap to an all-economy aircraft because it leads to experience downgrade and these tend to happen more when the airline has to start sending aircraft for &amp;ldquo;C&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;D&amp;rdquo; checks.The last problem that the airline will have to manage is to differentiate from what Jet Airways and Kingfisher Airlines did &amp;ndash; having a mono class flight in the morning and a dual or three class in the evening, creating confusion in the minds of passengers!While it takes time to get the configuration right, it should not be an eternal process!Ameya Joshi is the founder of aviation analysis blog NetworkThoughts.&amp;nbsp;Ameya writes a lot on aviation.

NEW DELHI (IANS) — The Ministry of Defense has transferred 60 officers to the newly-created Department of Military Affairs which is headed by country's first Chief of Defense Staff General Bipin Rawat.
 The Jan. 13 transfer order accessed by IANS stated, "The officers are hereby transferred from the Department of Defence to the newly created Department of Military Affairs with immediate effect."
 A total of 13 deputy secretaries, 25 under secretaries and 22 section officers were transferred to the DMA.
 The order with respect to transfer of two joint secretaries in the department has not been issued so far. The order stated: "The orders in respect of Joint Secretaries and supporting staff will be issued separately."
 The DMA got formal structure Jan. 10 after creation of posts for two joint secretaries, 13 deputy secretaries and 22 under secretaries and 22 section officers. They will assist the Chief of Defense Staff to carry out his responsibilities.
 General Rawat's task is to push the three Services to truly integrate in planning, procurement, logistics, doctrines and training. The CDS would provides single-point military advice to the government as well as function as the military advisor to the Prime Minister-led Nuclear Command Authority.
 Though the three Service chiefs will retain full operational control over their forces, the CDS will clearly be the "first among equals" in the hierarchy.
 At present, India has as many as 17 single-Service commands, with each force reluctant to give up its command. India has only one joint command that is in the Andaman and Nicobar Command.
 The DMA will be the fifth department in the Ministry of Defense. The existing ones are the Department of Defence, the Department of Defence Production, the Department of Defense Research and Development and the Department of Ex- Servicemen Welfare.
 The DMA deals with the armed forces; the integrated headquarters of the Ministry of Defence, comprising the Army, Navy, the Air Force, defence staff headquarters and the Territorial Army.
 After taking charge as CDS, General Rawat's first directive to his tri-service integrated defence staff was to prepare a plan for the creation of an Air Defence Command and common logistics support pools for the armed forces.
 The proposal for the ADC should be prepared by June 30, said General Rawat, while also setting out the priorities for execution of synergy among the armed forces in different arenas in a time-bound manner by Dec. 31.

The world's oceans are warmer than ever — and they are getting warmer faster, according to a new report.
 In a development that provides yet further evidence of global warming, the study, published in the Chinese journal _Advances in Atmospheric Sciences_, found that ocean temperatures in the last decade have been the warmest on record.
 In addition, the research illustrates the influence of human-induced warming on the Earth's waters and indicates that sea-level rise, ocean acidification and extreme weather could get worse as the oceans go on absorbing excess heat.

For anyone who has chased performance in funds and ETFs, it’s a story that could help simplify their financial life while improving returns.
 Let’s explore the problem to see why.
 The performance gap between a fund and its shareholders is built around timing, and has been measured by a wide range of studies over several decades.
 The problem starts with investors looking for funds that have proved themselves worthy of being purchased. Typically, funds earn that trust — and thus investor dollars — by outperforming peers and topping the charts for their asset class or strategy.
 The hot performance draws in investors, who enter as the fund’s performance starts to regress toward the mean, because no fund remains hot forever.
 The fund may have great overall results even after performance recedes to the average, but the shareholder who bought in after the good run mostly got the decline, buying high and selling low, the opposite of the proverbial way to win in the stock market.
 In the latest “Mind the Gap” study released by Chicago-based Morningstar, investors have narrowed the performance discrepancy largely by moving away from efforts to time the market.
 Morningstar found that the gap had declined around the globe, but noted that in the United States investors now trail their fund, on average, by 0.45%. In other words, if a fund delivered a 10% annualized gain over the decade ending in 2018, the average investor — factoring in additional purchases and withdrawals — earned 9.55% from the fund over that period.
 What makes Morningstar’s research so compelling is how different it is from other studies, showing a dramatically wider void.
 Research from DALBAR, for example, showed that investors were crushed by the stock market in 2018, losing 9.4% on the year as they repositioned portfolios to avoid mounting volatility, while the Standard & Poor’s 500 lost roughly 4.4% on the year.
 Morningstar’s picture is dramatically more positive, although Russel Kinnel, director of manager research and editor at Morningstar’s FundInvestor newsletter, noted that the jury is still out on how much investors truly have learned because the 2018 market decline was short-lived.
 “It’s partly a more benign market, partly people are making better decisions, but we won’t know for sure until the next bear market really puts it to a test,” Kinnel said in an interview on “Money Life with Chuck Jaffe,” my investing/personal finance podcast (moneylifeshow.com). “It doesn’t happen in a vacuum, it’s not just that the market’s going down, but it’s that the market is going down and [the investor] is worried that they won’t have a job in six months. We’ve had blips along the way but not as much of a test as a real recession or real bear market.”
 But a soft market environment isn’t why investors’ performance aligns more closely with their funds; instead, it’s that investors themselves are lining up with their funds better, developing plans where the funds have a defined role.

Considering the economic sluggishness, tensions in West Asia and opposition to recent bills, this year&amp;rsquo;s Union budget provides an excellent opportunity for the government to restore confidence. Of late, India has seen a drop in consumer demand and lower GST collections; while unemployment and poor-quality of jobs remain the biggest pain points for the country&amp;rsquo;s youth. The government has in fact been working overtime to receive feedback from every stakeholder over the past few months. Come February 1, the country is hoping to see a more agile approach from the government in its pursuance of the $5 trillion target for India&amp;rsquo;s economy.TelecomConnectivity, whether physical or virtual, is the key to India&amp;rsquo;s growth. Thus, government must focus on assuaging the concerns of the telecom industry. Cutting back the obvious levies like licence fees and spectrum usage charges will boost the sector. As this is a capital- intensive industry, low-interest funding will definitely ease a few nerves. The government must remember that its populace has a huge appetite for data.Infrastructure spendingMost industry leaders are of the view that the finance minister must outline a roadmap to increased spending on infrastructure. Indian Railways has already topped its all-time high CAPEX this year. Infrastructure companies will definitely welcome exemptions from cross-subsidisation. The automotive sector commands 15 percent of India&amp;rsquo;s steel demand and holds the veto power on steel prices. While last year&amp;rsquo;s budget did focus on building waterways as an alternate source of transport, its effect on the import bill is still unknown. The government must encourage further spending on rural sector especially small- ticket rural ventures to kick start growth.Financial sectorThe unearthing of a number of frauds within the industry has affected lending and customer confidence. The government must act to encourage risk-averse banks to fuel credit for consumption growth and ensure timely redressal of cases referred to insolvency courts. It should relook at the FDI in insurance sector to boost foreign investments.Real estateThis sector has been facing a sluggish demand, leading to unsold inventory. Though the government has managed to introduce formalisation within the industry through institutional changes like GST, RERA, IBC; the fall of GDP has had a detrimental effect on the demand of both residential and commercial units. The government must ensure private sector involvement to achieve its &amp;lsquo;Housing For All&amp;rsquo; target by 2022.EducationThough the expenditure within the education sector has risen 4.5 times in the last 5 years, we still have a long way to go. Last year, the government announced skill certification schemes and Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojna (PMKVY) for making our graduates industry-ready. The government must ensure further incentives for the success of these schemes. With the country warming up towards online learning, lowering of GST rate, which is currently at 18 percent, will ensure that more people will seek professional assistance in skilling and reskilling themselves. In addition to the CSR initiatives, the government must introduce tax benefits for corporates who provide scholarship opportunities in higher education. Establishing research funds, improvement in the quality of teacher training and easy availability of student loans are some of the key focus areas for the government.Automobile sectorThe auto sector today is in the middle of the worst slowdown of this century. While the government in its last budget stressed upon subsidising &amp;lsquo;electric mobility&amp;rsquo;, there is room for more. Lowering and possibly scrapping of import duty on lithium-ion batteries is on top of every automotive company&amp;rsquo;s wish list. This shall lead to the domestic manufacturing of battery packs and subsequently create avenues for cell manufacturing. Furthermore, while the government is looking to lower emissions through the introduction of BS-VI, reduction of GST on these vehicles will help offset the increased cost/unit.Start-up industryWhile the industry has seen a growth of interest and appreciation, a stable policy environment still remains its biggest demand. The frequent changes in regulatory regimes have shaken the confidence of foreign investors. Considering the initiation phase of their organisations, a longer timeline to carry forward losses has also been one of the requests from this industry. As AI, IoT and Blockchain become the backbone of future technologies; the government must set-up a deep tech fund to encourage start-ups within these areas.Nilesh Gaikwad is Country Manager at EDHEC Business School, France.

When Washington imposed sanctions on companies, the move drew criticism not just from Russia but from Germany as well. The sanctions, targeting firms building the pipeline that will increase Gazprom's export capacity for Europe, were seen as interference in Germany's internal affairs while the legislators who approved them saw them as a tool for deterring Russia's energy influence in Europe. For some, however, the reason for the sanctions was the U.S.'s own energy plans for Europe. The Trump administration is following an agenda of energy dominance, and this dominance has to include Europe, which is one of the biggest markets for natural gas and, what's more relevant to the U.S., liquefied natural gas. However, lessons from history, and that's a history of Gazprom, would suggest that the energy dominance approach won't work--not in Europe. Bloomberg's Liam Denning recently reviewed a book by an IHS Markit expert on Russian energy, Thane Gustafson, titled The Bridge. The Bridge, according to Denning, contains, among other things, a cautionary tale for U.S. gas ambitions in Europe. The gist of it is that the European gas market is a lot more open and transparent than it used to be, and while this has served to reduce the influence of Gazprom on the continent, it has also served to deter anyone else that might want to try to take Gazprom's place. The truth is that today, Europe has developed a continental gas network, and that network features LNG terminals. This means that many European countries are today a lot more flexible in their gas imports than they were 30 years ago, when Russia and Norway dominated the market. There is just one catch the LNG has to be cheap enough to beat alternative supplies. RelatedThe Iran Crisis Is Far From Over Poland is already buying U.S. liquefied natural gas. The country is ready and willing to pay more if it has to, in order to reduce its dependence on Russian gas for a number of historical reasons. Yet last year Bulgaria, too, bought two cargos of U.S. LNG from Cheniere's Sabine Pass liquefaction plant. According to the head of the state gas operator, the cargos were priced at the level of local benchmark prices. Even so, Poland and Bulgaria are small potatoes. Germany is the biggest gas market in Europe and it will become even bigger as the country aims to shut down all its remaining nuclear power plants by 2022. This is why Gazprom is building Nord Stream 2 with Angela Merkel's blessing, after all. And this is why the U.S. is sanctioning it if we leave aside the ideology that every government uses to advance its purely pragmatic agenda. Germany imported $14.6 billion worth of natural gas in the first half of 2019. That was 14.8 percent higher than a year earlier, but the increase in volume terms was even greater these came in at 2.66 million terajoules, which was 20 percent higher than the year-earlier period. Historically, most of the imported gas has come from Russia, followed by Norway and the Netherlands. Now that the Netherlands is shutting down its flagship Groningen field ahead of schedule, Germany will need more gas from Russia and Norway. It could import U.S. LNG as per a EU promise to President Trump, as long as the price is right, as the EU Energy Commissioner said last year. Yet because of the open and transparent nature of Europe's gas market, Germany is also buying LNG from Russia. Just last month Novatek opened its first LNG fueling station in Germany. It is the first LNG station of the Russian company in Europe and could mark the start of a network. This is why energy dominance is a challenging goal in Europe's gas market. The fact that Germany and others are building new LNG terminals does not obligate them to use these terminals for U.S. LNG. Qatar is right around the corner, so to speak, and so are Nigeria and Algeria - both large LNG producers. Competition is intense and it's out in the open. The victory that EU competition watchdogs achieved in their fight with Gazprom's long-term contracts paved the way to the current competitive environment that leaves both Gazprom and U.S. LNG producers at the mercy of market forces.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.com

HONG KONG/BEIJING -- China is working to finalize its first rules to cover online-only banking operations in a push to minimize risk in the financial sector and attract players including foreign lenders, three people with direct knowledge of the matter said.
 The guidelines could also bolster foreigners with existing China operations such as Citigroup Inc, HSBC Holdings PLC and Standard Chartered PLC by allowing them to set up separate digital banking platforms, two of them said.
 The framing of rules come as companies' use of data as well as digital and artificial intelligence technologies have transformed China's financial services landscape, from processing payments to selling investment products.
 But foreigners have struggled to make money in mainland retail banking, with many yet to break even despite years of onshore presence as they compete with the vast physical networks of domestic rivals.
 About a dozen groups including foreigners are in talks with Chinese regulators over the new rules and have shown interest in launching digital banking operations, said one person who has been involved in such discussions with the banking watchdog.
 The rules would allow them to partner tech firms for independent digital banking platforms, the person said.
 Banks are expected to be allowed to own majority stakes in online-only banking ventures, the people said, as the government pushes ahead with its strategy of easing access for foreigners to China's vast financial markets.
 The framework, which will cover the existing online banking units of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd and Tencent Holdings Ltd among others, will form China's first comprehensive move to standardize oversight of the fast-growing digital banking sector.
 Other Asian economies including Hong Kong and Singapore are also ushering in digital-only banks.
 China has licensed four online-only banks since 2014 including Tencent-backed WeBank, Alibaba offshoot MYbank, and AiBank, backed by search engine operator Baidu Inc and China Citic Bank Corp Ltd.
 The People's Bank of China and the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission did not respond to Reuters' faxed requests for comment. The people declined to be identified as the regulatory plans are confidential.
 A spokesman for Citi said the bank would review the rules when they are published, and that its own China consumer banking business had already been digitized.
 HSBC declined to comment on the rules but said it would welcome any move that continued to open the financial markets in mainland China, and would always look for new opportunities to expand there.
 StanChart, AiBank, MYbank and WeBank declined to comment.
 In August, the central bank announced it was developing a three-year plan for the financial technology sector. It has yet to publish plans or give a timetable for doing so.
 So far the online sector has made little inroad into day-to-day banking, with assets of the four online banks standing at $56 billion at the end of 2018, latest official data showed, accounting for 0.15% of China's total banking assets.

LONDON -- How do you make a computer-generated lion, warthog and hyena look real while singing and talking at the same time?
 That was the challenge a visual effects team of more than 1,000 people faced when working on Disney's "The Lion King" remake of the 1994 animation, aiming to bring to life the much-loved characters, Mufasa and Simba, against a stunning but fake African savannah backdrop.
 Last year's second biggest grossing film, with global cinema takings of $1.6 billion according to tracking firm Box Office Mojo, "The Lion King" received a widely-expected visual effects Oscar nomination on Monday for its "photo real" digital imagery that makes it look like a wildlife documentary.
 A mammoth team worked on the Jon Favreau-directed movie, produced with computer animation, virtual reality, gaming technology and live-action methods. Visual effects company MPC, owned by technology and entertainment company Technicolor and with studios around the globe, was tasked with making the tale of lion cub Simba look like it had actually been filmed with real animals in Africa.
 "One of the biggest things you're responsible for is breathing life into these characters … They have to behave real and they have to look real," Adam Valdez, MPC visual effects supervisor who spent two and a half years working on "The Lion King," told Reuters in London.
 "And if the two things are ever out of whack with each other, it breaks the movie."
 Valdez, who won an Oscar for Favreau's Disney remake of "The Jungle Book," traveled to Kenya for research.
 "We do a lot of painstaking research into how real animals move, how their muscles and skin behave … and then in the computer, we recreate all these things," he said, adding the MPC team first created designs of the characters and landscape.
 "An artist, like an animator, has to sit down and actually hand animate that eye, hand animate that face so that every little subtle nuance is represented."
 Work on the movie took place in London, Bangalore and Los Angeles, where a headset-wearing Favreau and his team worked on a virtual reality set, using gaming technology to direct the scenes.
 "The game … that we wrote was about people walking around the savannah of Africa," Valdez said.
 "Instead of holding a game weapon they're holding a camera, and they're able to point the camera at the things they want to film and we're recording all this information in the computer."
 Valdez said each shot was then carefully recreated to make it look as realistic as possible.
 The team used recordings of the cast, which included Beyonce and Donald Glover, voicing their roles for scenes with dialog.
 "We were very subtle with it … Every tiny adjustment to say just how much eyes open or close, how much eye whites you see on the inside or outside of the irises, they all have an emotional meaning for us as humans," Valdez said.
 "But if … you push it, you snap the connection of the photo realism of the image that you're seeing with behavior that is of a different sort … It was a very tricky thing." (Reporting by Sarah Mills; Writing by Marie-Louise Gumuchian; editing by Diane Craft)

Someone has to be crazy not to pick David Warner or Steve Smith’s brains on how to tackle the Indian spinners on sub-continental tracks, young Australia middle-order batsman Ashton Turner said on Monday.
 Turner, who played all his three ODIs in Australia’s last tour of India, had hit a game-changing 84 at Mohali taking both Kuldeep Yadav and Yuzvendra Chahal to the cleaners.
 “I take a lot of confidence out of that (2019 series) against a world-class team and a world-class bowling attack. It has given me confidence that my ability is good enough against the best in the world,” Turner said on the eve of first One-Day International on Tuesday.
 Terming the Smith-Warner duo as “greats of Australian cricket”, who have always guided him on devising specific plans for Indian spinners.
 “As a young player coming into the team with little international experience, I’d be crazy not to be picking their brains and trying to learn from them because those two guys are the two best in the world,” he said.
 While he didn’t set the Indian Premier League on fire last year, the few weeks that he spent with Smith at the Rajasthan Royals was a learning experience.
 “I was fortunate to spend a few weeks with Steve at the IPL (with Rajasthan Royals). I spent so much time watching him bat in the nets and picking his brains about how (he) plays particularly in India. Dave’s (Warner) the same, he’s had so much success all around the world but particularly here in India and in the IPL,” added Turner.
 Turner thinks that he has learnt his lessons after a poor IPL. “Yeah, the IPL didn’t go to plan – getting out first ball, I have definitely learnt some lessons but it’s definitely not how I am going to be remembered in my career.
 “I’m here in a very different environment to what the IPL is, to what franchise cricket is, to be back here again, to be fortunate enough to be picked in another Australian squad is a completely different beast. It’s international cricket, you’ve got no option but to go out there and put your best foot forward,” he added.

Aramco has exercised the greenshoe option attached to its initial public offering, issuing another 450 million shares to raise an additional $3.8 billion, the company said as quoted by CNN. As a result, the already record-breaking IPO of the Saudi energy giant has been pushed up to a total $29.4 billion. Aramco listed 3 billion of its shares on the Tadawul exchange in early December and quickly touched the much-hyped $2-trillion valuation Crown Prince Mohammed was after when he decided to list a minority stake in the company. After that, however, the shares retreated, and last week took a nosedive on the renewed tension between the United States and Iran, which indirectly threatens the security of Saudi oil supply due to its proximity to Iran and the mutual hostility between the two largest countries in the Middle East. Using the greenshoe option, as CNN's Claire Duffy notes in her report on the news, is commonly used by issuers to keep the stock from falling below the issuing price. This, however, is not the case with Aramco. The additional shares were allocated to buyers before the listing and they will not be floated on Tadawul. Even so, the stock was down by 10 percent since the listing as of January 6. The top concern among investors is geopolitical right now, but this can change when the holding period instituted by the Saudi government for retail investors expires. The holding period is meant to prevent a quick selloff the moment Aramco's share price rises enough to be turned into a fat profit. Once it expires, six months after the listing, a selloff may still happen. Meanwhile, some analysts are still wondering how the Kingdom's oil giant will ease foreign investors' concerns about transparency and corporate governance risk, considering that Saudi Arabia's rulers will continue to call the shots. Yet these concerns would only come to the fore if Aramco decides to go through with an international listing, for which it is in no hurry.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.com

Delighting Customers is a new column that will take a deep look at the nuances of providing better customer service. This is the first installment. &amp;nbsp;Nobody escapes from service and satisfaction. All through your life, you are performing the action of service or deriving the emotion of satisfaction. This underlying thought got me wondering, and eventually, penning my thoughts on the subject.On the personal frontI see service in &amp;hellip;A baby crying for milk, the mother feeding and the angel dozing off with a blissful smile.Carrying your grandpa or grandma&amp;rsquo;s bag.A parent teaching math to her child.A child running errands for the parents.Serving your near and dear ones as they grow old.All this is service. And what do you get in return? A &amp;lsquo;thank you&amp;rsquo;, a sense of satisfaction, gratification of doing a duty.On the professional frontWhen we move from the personal front to the professional environment, service takes a very different meaning and form. Basically, it is taking good care of your customer or, may we say guest, and sending him off happy and satisfied. We call this customer service. And the returns come in the form of salary or profits. Sadly, but surely no sooner the guest transforms to customer, than views and serving attitudes take a paradigm shift.The third dimension A third dimension to bear in mind is that we play the dual role of service provider and customer every other minute of the day. It is done without choice. For example, when your grocer comes to the bank to deposit his daily collection, you are the service provider. When you visit his store to purchase something, you become his customer. So, both roles keep interchanging without your choice.While on the personal front, you willingly serve your guests, and on the third dimension as a customer, you expect excellent service. Then why does it change drastically when you are the service provider?Customer service is a mindsetCustomer service is a mindset where you set your mind to take good care of the customer simply by shifting your perspective about him. Here are a few thoughts that will help you to WOW your customer.See him or her as the guest visiting your home. &amp;lsquo;Athithi Devo Bhava&amp;rsquo;.Welcome the customer with a genuine smile and a warm greeting. Let him feel wanted.Always bear in mind, he is the reason you have a job; you draw a salary; have a roof over your head and take care of your family.A smile in English looks as good as a smile in Hindi, Marathi, Kannada, Tamil or in any other language. A smile does not have a language, similarly, service also is not confined to any language or accent. It is an attitude.When you shift your attitude, you shift your mindset. When you shift your mindset, you shift your customer service. When you shift your customer service, you shift your business. Now that is not rocket science!Listen and understand the purpose of his visit. A good listener delivers better.Value and respect his time.A secret to elevate any customer from satisfied to delighted is, to go the extra mile. Now, how to go the extra mile depends on your attitude and creativity. (Or, you may connect with me for the most bizarre ideas)Thank your customer for his visit or business, and request him to come again. Your parting gesture determines his next visit to your establishment.To reinforce your service commitment, a follow up with the customer would go a long way in lodging the satisfaction bug in his subconscious.In fact, in any business environment, we have paying customers and non-paying customers. The non-paying customers get away with a &amp;lsquo;Thank You&amp;rsquo;, and the paying customer of course, pays.To learn more about engaging employees, delighting customers and developing your business, please stay glued to this site.Till then please see every customer as a pleasure and not as a pain. Because, summing in one word, if you see him as a pain, its &amp;lsquo;OUCH&amp;rsquo;, and as a pleasure, a &amp;lsquo;WOW&amp;rsquo;.Gangadhar Krishna is the founder of delightingcustomers.com and author of an illustrative business book titled &amp;lsquo;Delighting Customers Is &amp;hellip;&amp;rsquo;.

I experienced what was probably one of the toughest moments in my life at the end of last year, but I am most grateful for all the support and care those around me have lovingly shown me. From a team that would take my place at events because I could not keep my mind in focus, friends who were always on standby to cheer me up, to family who stood by me, giving me positive affirmations to weather the storm. As much as we may not want to show people around us our vulnerable side, trust me, being vulnerable and speaking up about it only makes you stronger.
