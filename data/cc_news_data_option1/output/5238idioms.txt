The argument boils down to a question of how best to analyse the copious genetic data we now have available. One possibility put forward by the sponges-first supporters is that the animal tree that put comb jellies first is the result of an error. The problem occurs when one of the groups being studied has evolved much faster than the others. Fast evolving groups often look like they have been around for a long time. The comb jellies are one such group. Could the fast evolution of the comb jellies be misleading us into thinking they arose from an earlier split than they really did?

It does, however, go without saying that the pandemic has massively impacted apprenticeship starts. The apprenticeship system was facing challenges before 2020, but multiple stay at home orders and business closures have had a devastating impact. However, our eyes should remain on the future as we consider how we can start to lay the groundwork for a revitalisation of apprenticeships as a key pillar of our national economic recovery. A positive aspect of the Government's economic response to the pandemic has been the introduction of new incentive payments for employers who take on a new apprentice. The incentives are currently scheduled to run until 31st January 2021, but with so much uncertainty and disruption that is sure to persist well beyond the new year, we think that there is a strong case to extend these incentives up until the middle of next year.

That is definitely something we want to emphasize to our readers, _that the MIRROR of Lululemon might be a direct competitor to Apple fitness +, Peloton, or other digital fitness content providers but the whole concept and experience of the end-user is completely different._ Therefore, we believe that Lululemon does not have to go to a direct competition with Peloton or Apple Fitness+ to land fitness-savvy customers who are looking to get in a great body shape. Lululemon can basically reach customers who are just looking to improve their self-confidence.
 Some might decide to tackle the very intense physical exercises the MIRROR platform offers, which might make them feel confident about their body and how their mind can handle a very stressful physical experience. Others might be happy just to take a 15-minute yoga or dance lesson with their family and enjoy a positive reflection of their family in the mirror and be happy about the fact they can do something healthy together.
 When Lululemon announced that it had acquired MIRROR company for $500 million in cash earlier this year, plenty of Wall Street analysts were curious whether the main goal is to cross-sell Lululemon athletic apparel to existing MIRROR users and vice versa. But the CEO of Lululemon has stated during the CNBC interview that Lululemon has all of the necessary tools to enable MIRROR company to further increase its rapid growth trajectory. For instance, Lululemon has already established a sticky community with its membership program who are looking for ways to exercise or sweat. We believe that incorporating the MIRROR product into its membership program will basically enable the existing Lululemon community to stay connected and sweat even now during the stay-at-home orders. Besides, we believe that the MIRROR company under Lululemon will have access to better marketing and brand awareness campaigns than it used to have before on a stand-alone basis.
 An interesting question arises, why the founder of the MIRROR didn’t wait to go public in the near future? The following quote basically reflects how important was the Lululemon company for the development of the MIRROR product from the very beginning.

Eibar coach Jose Luis Mendilibar vented his fury after his side was denied a penalty in Sunday's 3-1 defeat by Real Madrid.
 Eibar was trailing 2-1 when the ball struck Real captain Sergio Ramos on the arm but it was denied a penalty and match referee Jose Luis Munuera Montero chose not to review the incident on the pitchside monitor.
 “We don't have any idea what's going on, this week there were a lot of handballs and we don't know when they should be punished and when they should not be,” the coach told reporters.
 “Today, a decision was taken in 20 seconds when normally it takes two or three minutes after a slow-motion replay.”
 Mendilibar loudly protested the decision from the sidelines and got a talking to from the referee before eventually calming down. However, he was not punished for his complaints.
 The coach, who has long opposed the use of video technology in football due to the disrupting effect it has on the game, said he did not think that VAR would help the lack of clarity over handballs.

of course. I was just pointing out in light of PP's comment there how the two sides are already way into playing that game. And I do think it makes equally clear that rmrd is falling for one side of the game. Edit to add: and more importantly, the last thing "bioethicists" (who are supposed to be helping rollout, not hurting it)should be doing in the situation we are in is adding fuel to the fires of both sides of the culture wars! I really find that stupid of them, lost all respect. If they don't know how to avoid riling people up about fairness, they are less than worthless as public servants on health, no? I wish they could be fired for starting this up, really I do. Shameful cluelessness for people who are supposed to understand "the public" as a whole.

 Real Madrid defender Dani Carvajal shared Mendilibar's frustration over handball decisions even though this time his side benefited from it.
 “It's not clear to us. There are some plays, which do not make sense. The criteria needs to be cleared up because otherwise we will protest against any decision,” he said.
 But Madrid coach Zinedine Zidane refused to get dragged into the debate when asked whether his side had been let off the hook.
 “The most important thing is that it was clear to the referee. It's the referee's job to decide, I'm not getting involved,” he said.
