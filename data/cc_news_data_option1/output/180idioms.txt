Good Omens, published by Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman in 1990, is a comedy about the birth of the son of Satan – but thanks to a terrible mix-up, the Antichrist (Adam) grows up in a nice English village with a nice family. As the End Times approach and the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse are summoned to Earth, what will happen to young Adam and his friends?

In a statement, the company told us: “We are very sorry that this happened and are taking the situation extremely seriously. The safety of our customers is our number one priority.”
 The company said decades of testing have proven the candles are safe if they’re used in accordance with the printed instructions, which include trimming the wicks to a quarter inch before lighting and never burning them for more than four hours.
 Chavis said their candle had only been burning for about 30 minutes.
 “I am 44 years old," Chavis said. "I know how to light a candle."
 And their candle close call wasn’t the only one.
 Nest camera video from last year shows the moments when a candle shot flames right into Ashley Brawley’s face.
 She said she was trying to put out a six-inch flame on her Bath & Body Works candle when it exploded. She was rushed to the ER with 1st and 2nd-degree burns from the fire and scalding wax.
 Over the summer, Morgan Singer said her candle exploded after being lit for less than an hour.
 “I was just having wine sitting by the island and it popped up and exploded," she said.
 Charlotte Fire is now warning people to be aware of how quickly this could happen, and exactly why you should never leave candles unattended.

At this time of the year, with long nights and dreary days, it can be easy to fall into a funk. We stay inside, get bored, feel lonely.
 But there is a way to escape the winter malaise, and it is to join a group or an organization or a sports league, to volunteer and give your time to a good cause, to make new friends and nurture old friendships.
 This is especially true on Cape Cod, with our large retirement population. We who no longer work are perfectly positioned to become active in philanthropic, social, athletic and cultural pursuits. If, like me, you spent over four decades working to provide for your family, raising and educating your children, and having scant time and few resources to devote to other activities, then you are now free to chase whatever may catch your fancy.
 There are many such opportunities on the Cape. My experience is hardly exceptional but may be illustrative.
 I have played for years in the Cape Cod Senior Softball League, where more than 200 men and a few women re-create the summers of their youth. After a game or a practice, I marvel that I am again playing ball under the sun and enjoying the camaraderie that comes with the sport. I have played a lot of softball and baseball as an adult, but nothing quite so satisfying as senior softball. If you have the itch to get back in the game, even after years of inactivity, look the league up on the internet. You will play in a division appropriate to your talents and age.
 The St. Vincent de Paul Society at my Catholic parish in Osterville helps those who find themselves in an unexpected financial quandary and need temporary economic assistance. The Barnstable Land Trust works to preserve our woods, waters, and open spaces. The Cape Cod Community College Educational Foundation provides scholarships and supports the school's programs and objectives.
 The Cape is home to scores of similar organizations that welcome and need volunteers. They assist the disadvantaged, comfort the afflicted, protect the environment, raise money for health centers, and contribute to libraries, fire departments, and school associations. Find one that suits your interests.
 Then there are organizations that have something for everyone - philanthropic endeavors, athletic competitions, social events, discussion groups, and even poker nights. I know because I belong to one - the Osterville Men's Club. We have a lot of fun golfing and bowling and playing cards, participating in groups that discuss investments and current affairs, and getting together with each other and our wives at an elegant holiday party and summer lunch. But the activities that best capture the spirit and purpose of the Club are those with charitable ends.
 Our 200 or so members fund three or four scholarships a year, each valued at $5,000, to distinguished seniors at Barnstable High School. We raise this money through personal contributions and raffles at our monthly lunches. In addition, every other year we reserve a month at the redemption center at the Barnstable Transfer Station, better known as the dump. Last September, 71 members - over a third of the membership - devoted time to staffing the center every day from early morning to late afternoon. In the process we raised almost $6,500 for scholarships and, every bit as important, spent many hours getting to know one another better.
 More than 15 members volunteer for the Meals on Wheels program, and every Friday several of them deliver meals to those who are housebound. And on the first Monday of every month, five members prepare and serve lunch to as many as 75 people at the Salvation Army in Hyannis.
 And, finally, some 25 members contribute to "A Day of Caring" once a year. Recently, we helped paint a home for unwed mothers and rehabilitated a house and yard for a needy senior.
 Despite the name, the Osterville Men's Club welcomes men from all over the Cape. You'll find that our efforts buoy the spirit and soothe the soul. They enlighten and gratify. Come join us, or some other group. You'll feel better for it.

SPOKANE — To prevent more suicides, the Spokane County Jail will heighten its 4-foot railings to the ceiling on the floor from which an inmate jumped and died.
 Jail Director Mike Sparber said the bars will go around the circumference of the second floor mezzanine level, where the jail houses inmates who are on suicide watch, detoxing from drugs or alcohol, and those who have been recently booked into jail. The bars are currently about 4 feet high.
 He said the inmate who died in December in an apparent suicide, Robert A. Taitch, 33, was not on suicide watch at the time of his death, but had symptoms of withdrawal from either drugs or alcohol. Taitch, who had been booked into jail two days prior for controlled substance homicide, violating a no-contact order, assault and theft, died after he jumped from a guardrail and hit his head on the concrete floor below.
 Suicide is the leading cause of death in the state’s jails, making up about 42 percent, according to a report by a law firm. About 61 percent of people who die in jail die within the first week of being booked.
 Taitch was the 14th inmate to die in Spokane County Jail custody since 2015.
 Taitch was not the first Spokane County inmate to die from jumping or falling from a railing. Two inmates have died from jumping from second-floor railings in the jail, and three inmates have attempted the same since 1998.
 Sparber said no other inmates have attempted suicide in the same matter since Taitch died in December.
 The floor-to-ceiling bars will cost about $22,000 and should be complete by mid-February. If they work well, Sparber said they could be installed in other places in the jail.
 “I want to be proactive; that’s why I’m going with the rails along there, just to take that (option) away on that floor,” he said. “Everything we think of, there’s other ways. It’s a matter of getting out in front of it in as many ways as we can.”
 Cpl. Mark Gregory, a spokesman for the Spokane County Sheriff’s Office, said the investigation into Taitch’s death is still open. A toxicology report is pending.
 The Spokane County Jail has long had issues with overdoses, withdrawal, suicides and overcrowding. The downtown jail was designed for 460 inmates, and on the day of Taitch’s death it was housing 672. The jail is in the midst of training staff and installing body scanners to detect drugs before they can get into the jail. Those should be up and running within the next two months. A mail scanner has been installed to detect unauthorized substances hidden in inmates’ mail.

 Development and environmental problems start with the planning commissions in the town of Bluffton, Hilton Head and Beaufort County. Developers get the "green light" because they meet some obscure T-2 or U-5 development code numbers. After passage the developer returns with demands to make changes not brought out initially, but miraculously mandatory now. Unless the public gets up in arms, the developer's wishes are granted. Development is good. Really?
   
 Who are these commission members? Do you know? What are their qualifications? How long have they been members? Are they just reappointed term after term? What does it mean serving "at large"? Who allows someone to serve "at large," particularly as the chairman or vice chairman? Why do the same names keep popping up on different councils, committees and commissions? Is this an elitist clique? You need to find out.
   
 Question loudly. Community development problems start at the planning commissions. Are you happy with what has been going on? If not, get involved. Demand new faces, not the elites who feel they are the only enlightened ones with proper insight to our area's future. Common sense, anyone?

India’s Monetary Policy Committee surprised observers in December 2019 when it decided not to cut interest rates, after five straight cuts prior. Every single one of the 34 economists surveyed by Bloomberg before the committee’s meeting expected a cut, and so the decision not to lower rates suggested the panel members were more worried about the state of the economy than analysts realised.
 On Monday, the panel’s decision seemed to have been vindicated: Government data showed that retail inflation hit 7.35% in December 2019, the highest since 2014, and well above the permitted band of 4% with leeway of 2 percentage points on either side that the Reserve Bank of India is supposed to ensure. The spike was powered by vegetable prices, which were up 60%. But even if you look at food inflation without vegetables and pulses, which have seen the largest jump, it is still coming in at 5% which is a 33-month high.
 The inflation spike comes just as the government confirmed that India is looking at 5% Gross Domestic Product growth for financial year 2019-’20, if not lower. Over the last year, data that has emerged about employment has also been worrisome, suggesting that joblessness is at multi-decade highs.
 Low growth. High inflation. High unemployment. That combination is the definition of “stagflation”, a word that suggests a stagnant economy in which prices are stubbornly high. It is a peculiar phenomenon because conventional economic theory used to believe that high unemployment would automatically lead to low prices and vice versa. When that relationship is broken, the effects can be difficult for governments to handle and leave an economy bumbling along for years. Former Prime Minister Manomhan Singh warned that India was facing the dangers of such a phenomenon a few months ago, calling for immediate action to prevent it from setting in.
 India is still not in a phase of stagflation, in part because most are expecting the inflation numbers to come down in the next few months as the winter crop is harvested and imports stabilise the situation. Even so, policymakers have every reason to be worried – both about inflation remaining stubbornly high for unforeseen reasons or, simply, that the economy is behaving in unpredictable waves.
 Bloomberg’s economist survey, for example, produced a projected inflation number of 6.7%, a good 0.6 percentage points lower than the actual one. Similarly, none of the economists in December had expected the Monetary Policy Committee to keep rates steady. An unpredictable economy makes policymaking much harder, and also turns off potential investors.
 What should the government do in the upcoming Budget? As we wrote last week, there is no silver bullet. The government’s finances are in a woeful position, giving it very little space to offer major stimulus, and even if it did so that might further drive inflationary tendencies. At the very least, the answer involves a deft combination of stimulus, incentives for businesses to invest more and a clear indicator to industry about the government’s objectives in its approach.
 There is one thing that can help address the unpredictability at the very least. Over the last few years, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government has not owned up to the actual state of government finances. Using off-budget borrowings and other creative accounting techniques, it has hidden the full extent of the fiscal deficit. In the post-elections budget of July 2019, it also threw in extremely unrealistic expectations for the year head, even when it knew that those were based on flawed numbers.
 Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman can use the upcoming Budget to come clean about the actual situation that the government finds itself in, while also providing transparency on official policymaking objectives. Forward guidance is the key to a stable economy. Any attempt at numerical chicanery would be counter productive.

ASOTIN — An Idaho County woman has filed a complaint for damages against Tri- State Memorial Hospital for “medical negligence” after she was allegedly given a megadose of antibiotics.
 According to court documents filed in Asotin County Superior Court, Norene Bentley was prescribed gentamicin in 2018 after being diagnosed with an acute bacterial infection. Instead of the prescribed daily dose of 50 milligrams for 10 days, the complaint alleges the hospital provided 500 milligrams a day and instructed her to take that dose.
 A few days after receiving the antibiotics, Bentley complained that she felt “under the weather,” and a blood draw reportedly showed elevated levels of the drug, according to the lawsuit. After repeated visits to the hospital, the physican recommened that gentamicin be stopped, but Bentley continued to suffer the adverse effects.
 According to the lawsuit, the physician noted, “On reviewing patient’s gentamicin dosing, it seems that patient received a much higher dose ... It is unclear at this time how this error happened.”
 As a result of the excessive dose, Bentley suffered serious and permanent injuries, the lawsuit alleges, including dizziness, hearing loss and nausea.
 Lewiston-based attorney Christopher Caldwell filed the complaint on Bentley’s behalf. The plaintiff is seeking damages to be determined at trial for medical expenses, pain and suffering, loss of enjoyment of life, emotional distress, impairment and embarrassment, according to court documents.
 As of Tuesday, the hospital’s response had not been filed.

De VVD heeft het plan bedacht om de wachtlijst voor het zogenoemde 'eenvoudig trouwen' te verkorten.
 In Utrecht kunnen stellen al eenvoudig trouwen. Dit gebeurt in ongeveer tien minuten, zonder ceremonie maar wel met het jawoord en het ondertekenen van de papieren. Deze vorm van trouwen gebeurt in een speciale ruimte op de zesde verdieping op het Stadskantoor.
