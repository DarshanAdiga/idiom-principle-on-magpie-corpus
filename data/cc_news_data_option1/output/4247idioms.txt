Yeah, I used to be active on the local school board meetings until it became crystal clear that the only thing driving the decision was the athletic director (who was/is the dumbest of the dumb). All of the "safety" and "caution" they were taking... nah, sportsball will happen, it has to happen, and for it to happen, the school has to be open. Oh, other schools have had outbreaks directly tied to their programs... that can't happen here because, uh, that was there, not here.

Ludhiana The announcement made by farmers' associations to allow movement of goods trains has come as relief for industrialists and traders in Ludhiana. Many of them were struggling to make ends meet amid rising cost of raw material and orders being cancelled by buyers due to delay in transportation. Industrialists had been urging the state government to intervene in the matter, as apart from increase in input cost, the production cycle of industrial units were also hit amid the farmers' protests. Importers and exporters from Ludhiana have also welcomed the decision taken by the farmers' associations.Rahul Ahuja, chairman, Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), Punjab, said, "If import and export would stay disturbed for the coming days, many industrial units in the city would have to close down due to shortage of raw material. With no import of raw material, the production cycle was hit badly. Also, orders, especially those booked by customers from abroad, were being cancelled due to the delay. We had been urging the farmers' associations to allow movement of goods trains and the announcement has come as a major relief for the industry. These agitations in the state also pushes away the investors, which will ultimately hit Punjab's economy."Harish Dua, president of the Knitwear and Apparel Exporters Association, said, "The transportation cost had increased as industrialists were being forced to move goods by road. It was costing us around Rs 20,000 more to transport goods to Mumbai port through road. Further, orders were being cancelled by foreign buyers due to delay."At a time when the industry is already struggling to get back on track after lockdown, black marketing of raw material amid shortage of supply is also taking a toll on business as input cost has increased. Jagbir Sokhi, president of the Sewing Machine Development Cluster, said, "The sewing machine sector is facing shortage of raw material, including pig iron, as consignments are stuck in Ambala due to no movement of goods trains. Due to shortage of material in the market, black marketing has increased. Pig iron which was earlier available at Rs 28,200 per tonne, now costs Rs 41,000 per tonne. The industry was already reeling under losses and the input cost has further increased by over 20% due to the lockdown and 'rail roko' protests by farmers."Sunil Mehra, state general secretary of the Punjab Pradesh Beopar Mandal, said, "We hope that the business which was going through a slowdown will be back on track during the festival season."

The milieu of “Culture” is one of conscious ’80s hip-hop, featuring VJs like Brooke-Lynn (Lena Waithe) and Sista Soul (Yaani King Mondschein) who sport braids and natural hair and extol Afrocentric organic living. But when new management comes in, spearheaded by a floppy-haired ’80s monster Grant (James Van Der Beek) and “first Black supermodel” Zora (Vanessa Williams), they quickly pivot to new talent and a new image, embodied by mononymic pop/ R&B diva Sandra (Kelly Rowland), who shakes her long, shaggy mane almost harder than she shakes her hips in her music videos.
 Desperately hoping to move up the food chain at “Culture,” now called “Cult,” Anna, a classic shrinking violet with a short, natural 'fro, meets with Zora, equipped with stellar ideas and stats. But if she wants to succeed, Zora tells her, “my girls need to flow freely.” Anna leaves with a card for an exclusive salon, Virgie’s, where a mysterious stylist (Laverne Cox) offers the hottest new hair trend in town, a sew-in weave of long, glossy black hair. While she loves her new 'do, turning heads at the office, this scalp-searing mane is incredibly, violently and bloodthirstily high maintenance, seemingly with a mind all its own.

“I’m really thrilled to be back,” said VHS senior Malachi Davis. “These past two weeks, you’re just sitting at home trying to find ways to get better without being around your teammates. It’s been really tough.”
 Players had the ability to access the team’s game-film archives while away, allowing them to virtually prepare for Tavares. Team members were also encouraged to continue conditioning regimens at home — if able — keeping them in simulated game-ready shape.
 “I’ve spent a lot of time trying to figure out how we crank things back up again,” Pettus said. “Obviously, safety is our No. 1 focus right now and making sure we’re still operating within all the right protocols and guidelines. We know it’s going to a little bit of a struggle getting back up to speed, but we’ve got to be ready to go and be ready to compete on this short week of preparation.”
 Pettus and his staff emphasized the safety protocols in place on Monday — the same ones held to such high standards since the team’s offseason conditioning program began in June — which included a maximum of six players socially- distanced inside the locker room at once. Players were also required to receive a temperature check and complete a self-reported COVID-19 questionnaire prior to practice, while hand-washing took place at each designated water break.
 “I think it definitely opened our eyes a little bit,” said VHS junior Brandon Kennard. “We were doing what we’re supposed to do, we were staying safe and we were having a great couple weeks of football — and then it just hits us. It makes you realize that you can’t take anything for granted.”

Gumbaz, the mausoleum of 18th century rulers of Mysore Hyder Ali and Tipu Sultan, and Daria Daulat Bagh, also known as Tipu’s Summer Palace, in Srirangapatna near here used to draw a large number of tourists during Dasara festivities every year. But, the tourist attractions are wearing a deserted look this year.
 The number of tourists visiting the destinations had been reduced to a trickle after the lockdown was eased more than four months ago. Though the tourist arrival had picked up marginally during the last two months, the numbers were nowhere close to the pre-lockdown days.
 According to sources at the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) in Srirangapatna, the Daria Daulat Bagh would receive between 1,000 to 1,500 visitors every day during weekdays and between 2,000 to 2,500 visitors during weekends before the lockdown. The numbers have now come down to just 100 to 150 a day.

BOISE, Idaho (AP) — Hospitals around the United States are starting to buckle from a resurgence of COVID-19 cases, with several states setting records for the number of people hospitalized and leaders scrambling to find extra beds and staff. New highs in cases have been reported in states big and small — from Idaho to Ohio — in recent days. With persistent resistance to statewide mask mandates, some states are relying on individuals to do the right thing to stem the tide of the virus. Other states are worried about the spike putting pressures on the health system and are making plans for ensuring those infected get the hospital care they need. In the United States, there have been more than 8 million confirmed cases and more than 220,000 deaths.

Qualcomm is really the only game in town on the Android side of things and while catching the A14 Bionic seems clearly out of reach for the Snapdragon 875, perhaps Qualcomm can finally catch the A13 Bionic.

Adds government spokesman on other cabinet ministers not requiring quarantine)
 BERLIN, Oct 21 (Reuters) - German Health Minister Jens Spahn tested positive for the coronavirus on Wednesday afternoon, the health ministry said, adding that he had placed himself in home quarantine.
 The minister, 40, was suffering from cold-like symptoms, the ministry said. People he had been in contact with were being informed.
 A government spokesman said Spahn had attended a cabinet meeting earlier on Wednesday, but other cabinet ministers would not necessarily have to go into quarantine.
 "The federal cabinet meets in compliance with hygiene and distance rules, which aim to ensure that even if a person who later tests corona-positive were to participate, quarantining of other or even all participants would not be necessary," he said.
 While Germany's infection rates are lower than in much of Europe, they have been accelerating and hit a daily record of 7,830 on Saturday, according to the Robert Koch Institute, Germany's federal disease prevention agency.
 "My best wishes for @jensspahn," tweeted Europe Minister Michael Roth. "Hopefully he will be back on board soon. Healthy and committed. We need everyone and anything now in the fight against the #Corona."
 Spahn has urged Germans to stick to social distancing rules to keep infections at a manageable level.
 Earlier this month, he said Germans face a "test of character" to contain a surge in the number of coronavirus cases.
 Spahn, a popular member of Chancellor Angela Merkel's government, had been expected to run for the leadership of their Christian Democrats earlier this year but backed Armin Laschet, premier of Germany's most populous state North Rhine-Westphalia.
 The party will pick a new leader in December. (Reporting by Thomas Escritt and Paul Carrel Writing by Thomas Escritt and Paul Carrel Editing Peter Graff)

You’re going to see some amazing stuff emerge, some long-established institutions, like universities, disappear — and the nature of work, workplaces and the workforce be transformed.
 I’ve been discussing this moment with Ravi Kumar, president of the Indian tech services company Infosys, whose headquarters is in Bangalore. Because Infosys helps companies prepare for a digital world, I’ve always found it a source of great insight on global employment/education trends. I started my book “The World Is Flat” there in 2004. Back then, Infosys' main business was doing work that American companies would outsource to India. Today, Kumar operates from New York City, where he’s creating thousands of jobs in America. How could that be?
 It starts with the fact, explained Kumar, that the Industrial Revolution produced a world in which there were sharp distinctions between employers and employees, between educators and employers and between governments and employers and educators, “but now you’re going to see a blurring of all these lines.”
 Because the pace of technological change, digitization and globalization just keeps accelerating, two things are happening at once: The world is being knit together more tightly than ever — sure, the globalization of goods and people has been slowed by the pandemic and politics, but the globalization of services has soared — and “the half-life of skills is steadily shrinking,” said Kumar, meaning that whatever skill you possess today is being made obsolete faster and faster.
 Your children can expect to change jobs _and professions_ multiple times in their lifetimes, which means their career path will no longer follow a simple “learn-to-work” trajectory, as Heather E. McGowan, co-author of “The Adaptation Advantage,” likes to say, but rather a path of “work-learn-work- learn-work-learn.”
 “Learning is the new pension,” McGowan said. “It’s how you create your future value every day.”
 The most critical role for K-12 educators, therefore, will be to equip young people with the curiosity and passion to be lifelong learners who feel ownership over their education.
 Obviously, everyone still needs strong fundamentals in reading and writing and math, but in a world where you will change jobs and professions several times, the self-motivation to be a lifelong learner will be paramount.

Police said they had decided initially not to go public about the incident out of "tactical considerations related to the investigation." On Tuesday night, the weekly Die Zeit and Deutschlandfunk radio broke the story. On Wednesday, police called for witnesses to come forward with any accounts of suspicious people or events they noticed on Oct. 3.
 It wasn't clear how the liquid was applied to the works, Pfohl said. They appeared to have been chosen at random, and investigators are inclined to believe that a lone perpetrator was responsible, he added -- but they aren't ruling out multiple perpetrators.
 Pfohl said that police are investigating "in every direction" but wouldn't participate in local media speculation that conspiracy theorists might be involved.
 There was no indication of it being "an act that speaks for itself," he added. "This is a variety of objects that do not have any immediate connection in terms of context ... we have no self-incriminating letter or anything like that, so we have to assume for now that the motive is completely unclear."

“The pennant was worse for us,” Bogdanovich said. “But game by game all year was not a pleasant experience.”
 The Dodgers have gone 52-20 through the regular season and postseason so far. Blindly betting $100 on L.A. in all 72 games would have paid $775 (per our data at Bet Labs) despite the average line being north of -200.
 Backing the Dodgers on the run line also proved profitable, netting a $100 bettor $1,124 over 72 games. The only team more profitable on the run line was the White Sox.
 It’s even rougher at BetMGM, where Jason Scott, the firm’s vice president of trading, says that the Dodgers are “our biggest single liability” among playoff teams, and “considerably larger than the Lakers.”
 While the Lakers won the title, BetMGM had more more money on their Staples Center co-tenant, the Clippers.
 “The Rockies would have been worse for us than the Dodgers, believe it or not, because we are new to Colorado and those small bets at 200-1 add up quickly,” Scott said.
 Scott said the aggregate money in Nevada, plus one bettor, who when the Dodgers were down to the Braves in the NLCS bet $100,000 at 4-1, makes Los Angeles a bad result.
 Three or four parlays will also pay off big if the Dodgers, their last leg, prevail.

When you’re out and about, make sure your mask stays clean and maintains its shape. Rolling your mask down to your chin, or cramming it into your pocket isn’t optimal since “it’s getting bunched up, it’s getting folded up and you’re potentially soiling it,” says Jandu. “Soiling it or compromising the integrity of the mask, and then putting it on, would not be ideal.” Use a Ziploc bag to avoid this, and replace the bag every few days. You can also use a small reusable bag, like a sunglasses bag or a jewelry pouch—just remember to wash it as often as you wash your masks.

The inexperienced young guns of both Rajasthan Royals and Sunrisers Hyderabad would like to put their hands up in testing times when both teams square off in a must-win Indian Premier League game on Thursday.
 Whether it is Priyam Garg, Abdul Samad of Sunrisers or Kartik Tyagi, Riyan Parag of the Royals, the youngsters from both sides will be feeling the pressure of doing something out of the box in case their illustrious seniors fail in that pursuit.
 Royals would hope to continue with the winning momentum and will expect their foreign recruits to perform like they did against CSK.
 While Jofra Archer continues to be the backbone of Royals’ bowling attack, the wrist-spinning duo of Shreyas Gopal and Rahul Tewatia were terrific in the middle overs against CSK.
 In batting, Jos Buttler looked in ominous form the other night, forcing skipper Smith to play the second fiddle but RR would need more consistent partnerships upfront.
 SRH, on the other hand, would still be smarting from the Super Over loss to Kolkata Knight Riders on Sunday.
 David Warner and Co. would definitely be hurt by that loss but they need to come out of that shock quickly.
 The team heavily relies on its batting unit, mainly on the top four comprising Jonny Bairstow, Warner, Manish Pandey and Kane Williamson.

The announcement made by farmers' associations to allow movement of goods trains has come as relief for industrialists and traders in Ludhiana.
 Many of them were struggling to make ends meet amid rising cost of raw material and orders being cancelled by buyers due to delay in transportation.
 Industrialists had been urging the state government to intervene in the matter, as apart from increase in input cost, the production cycle of industrial units were also hit amid the farmers' protests.
 Importers and exporters from Ludhiana have also welcomed the decision taken by the farmers' associations.
 Rahul Ahuja, chairman, Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), Punjab, said, "If import and export would stay disturbed for the coming days, many industrial units in the city would have to close down due to shortage of raw material. With no import of raw material, the production cycle was hit badly. Also, orders, especially those booked by customers from abroad, were being cancelled due to the delay. We had been urging the farmers' associations to allow movement of goods trains and the announcement has come as a major relief for the industry. These agitations in the state also pushes away the investors, which will ultimately hit Punjab's economy."
 Harish Dua, president of the Knitwear and Apparel Exporters Association, said, "The transportation cost had increased as industrialists were being forced to move goods by road. It was costing us around Rs 20,000 more to transport goods to Mumbai port through road. Further, orders were being cancelled by foreign buyers due to delay."
 At a time when the industry is already struggling to get back on track after lockdown, black marketing of raw material amid shortage of supply is also taking a toll on business as input cost has increased.
 Jagbir Sokhi, president of the Sewing Machine Development Cluster, said, "The sewing machine sector is facing shortage of raw material, including pig iron, as consignments are stuck in Ambala due to no movement of goods trains. Due to shortage of material in the market, black marketing has increased. Pig iron which was earlier available at Rs 28,200 per tonne, now costs Rs 41,000 per tonne. The industry was already reeling under losses and the input cost has further increased by over 20% due to the lockdown and 'rail roko' protests by farmers."
 Sunil Mehra, state general secretary of the Punjab Pradesh Beopar Mandal, said, "We hope that the business which was going through a slowdown will be back on track during the festival season."

Multiple vaccine candidates are in final-stage studies in tens of thousands of adults, and scientists are hopeful that the next few months will bring evidence that at least some of them are safe and effective enough for widespread use.But when the first shots arrive, they’re unlikely to be recommended for children. Vaccines can’t be given to youngsters unless they’ve been tested in their age group -- a major hurdle in efforts to reopen schools and resume more normal activities that are critical to families' well- being.“The public doesn’t understand that,” said Dr. Evan Anderson of Emory University, who has been pushing for pediatric testing of COVID-19 vaccines. While he’s encouraged by Pfizer’s study in adolescents, he finds it “very concerning” that children younger than 12 may not have a vaccine by next fall.Children represent about 10% of COVID-19 cases documented in the U.S. And while children are far less likely than adults to get seriously ill, about 120 have died in the U.S. alone, according to a tally by the American Academy of Pediatrics. That’s about how many U.S. children die from flu in an average year. Additionally, a small number have developed a serious inflammatory condition linked to the coronavirus.Overall, Anderson says COVID-19′s impact on children is greater than some other diseases that require routine pediatric vaccinations.Aside from their own health risks is the still unanswered question about how easily children can infect others. In a letter to federal health officials, the AAP cited recent evidence that those over age 10 may spread the virus just as easily as adults do.Add missing school and other factors unique to children, and it’s unethical “to allow children to take on great burdens during this pandemic but not have the opportunity to benefit from a vaccine,” Dr. Sara Goza, president of the pediatrics academy, wrote.Globally, pediatric studies are only hesitantly emerging. In China, Sinovac and SinoPharm have opened studies that can test children as young as 3.A British study of a vaccine by AstraZeneca allows for testing of a low dose in certain children but the company says it won’t be recruiting youngsters until it has “sufficient” safety data in adults.In the U.S., Moderna Inc., Johnson &amp; Johnson and Novavax all hope to begin some pediatric research later in the year, in varying age groups.Doing so is critical, said Dr. Robert Frenck, who directs the Vaccine Research Center at Cincinnati Children’s.“If we immunize adolescents -- and potentially move down into younger children -- we’re going to have the effect of keeping those children from getting infected. But then also they don’t bring the infection home to parents and grandparents,” he said.Frenck is finding lots of interest in Pfizer’s adolescent testing, with 90 families seeking more information in just a week after his team issued a call for 16- and 17-year-old volunteers. The researchers plan to enroll 12- to 15-year-olds soon.Katelyn, the suburban Cincinnati volunteer, doesn’t know if she got a dummy shot or the real vaccine. But the high school junior is excited to be part of the study. And with science class still fresh, she grasped the researchers' explanation of how Pfizer’s vaccine works -- using a piece of genetic code to train the body to recognize if the coronavirus comes along.“I’ve learned about DNA and RNA and all that stuff in biology in freshman year. And I guess I didn’t really know, like, how it applied to the real world until now,” she said.It makes sense to start pediatric testing in teenagers and gradually work down in age, Frenck said, because adolescents usually receive adult-sized doses of other vaccines -- and so far with Pfizer’s shots, serious safety problems haven’t emerged in adult testing.Assuming Pfizer’s shot is proven to work in adults, Frenck said the key will be if the vaccine revs up adolescents' immune systems the same way -- without different side effects. He said if all goes well, it’s possible scientists may have an answer about the 12-and-older group by spring.But younger children need their own testing. Anderson, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta, said those studies may be more complex because smaller tots may need different doses or, because of their typically more robust immune systems, show different reactions to the shots.“It is quite important for us to begin the process because this will take some time to do the studies the right way,” he said.___AP video journalist Kathy Young contributed to this report.___The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

Ghaziabad A controversy has broken out over 236 Dalits from a colony in Ghaziabad's Karhera allegedly converting to Buddhism to protest the Hathras gang-rape and murder case, following which district administration officials rushed to take stock of the situation on Wednesday. Those who allegedly "converted" were said to be residents of Valmiki Basti, near the Hindon airbase. They claimed they converted on October 14 to seek justice for the 19-year-old Dalit woman in Hathras who was allegedly gang-raped and later died of her injuries last month.District officials, however, said there had been no conversion and that when they visited the locality, people raised issues such as jobs, power supply and housing.Pawan Valmiki, 27, who says he has changed his surname to "Boudh" after the "conversion", said more people would convert in case their 16-point agenda of demands, which they claimed they had submitted to the delegation, were not met within a week. "Justice for our sister (Hathras victim) who was murdered is a major concern for us. About 236 people converted to Buddhism on the evening of October 14. In coming time, more people will get converted in case the victim of Hathras case doesn't get justice," said Pawan, adding other demands were indeed related to other issues. "We don't have a community centre here for functions. We have also not received benefits of PM Awas Yojna and Ujjwala Schemes. People from Dalit community are basically sidelined. The MLA, district magistrate and senior superintendent of police heard us and promised that the issues will be resolved," he said, adding that he founded the 'Navyuvak Sangharsh Sewa Samiti' to demand their rights.The Hathras case, which sparked widespread outrage after the police forcibly cremated the victim's body, is being investigated by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).Vir Singh, another resident, said that people of his caste felt pressured and that they were appalled by the events that took place at Hathras. "If we do not get justice this time, we will search for some other way. It is likely that more people will convert. We want justice and our youth need jobs," he said. "There is lot of resentment in our community. So, slowly, we all will get converted to Buddhism," said Rajjo, another resident. District magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey said prohibitory orders were in place at Karhera since the pandemic struck, making it impossible that 236 people to gather for a "conversion" ceremony. However, an additional district magistrate was inquiring into it, he added."We spoke to the residents there, including Pawan Valmiki. They raised issues such as the lack of jobs, electricity, housing, among others. He claimed that some locals had threatened them. The senior superintendent of police will take appropriate action. Pawan told us that the decision (to convert) was taken in the heat of the moment. But he did not raise the Hathras case with us," said Pandey. "They did not hand over any letter about a 16-point agenda."Sahibabad MLA Sunil Sharma, who also accompanied the district administration, said there was a political conspiracy behind the entire issue. "We have come to know of involvement of people from a political party. During the meeting, people raised their local issues like housing, ration cards, etc. There is no conversion," he said.Community meets KejriwalPawan Valmiki on Wednesday met with Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal in the Capital. Pawan said he is the founder-president 'Navyuvak Sangharsh Sewa Samiti' formed to fight for Dalit rights. He had earlier worked as a housekeeping staff at a highrise in Mohan Nagar but lost his job during the lockdown. "My father is bed ridden due to ailment for about 5-6 years and I lost the job. I have to feed my family which also include a son and a daughter. Our electricity bills are mounting and can be disconnected any day," he said. "Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal sent a car for us and five of us went to meet him at his official residence. He shared his concerns over the Hathras incident but also said that we should not have converted. He also assured us that he will come at Karhera in couple of days to meet us.".Later, AAP Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh tweeted pictures of the meeting and wrote, "There is no justice for Dalits under the rule of Yogi Adityanath. They are being raped and murdered. Angry after the Hathras scandal, several from the Valmiki community left Hinduism. They shared their pain with Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal."

Even the lowest common denominator of news — simply being interesting — has been tossed aside. Boring and uneventful is the new newsworthy.
 This presumably isn’t how they teach it in journalism school, but no one has had trouble adjusting.
 The tendency reached a new level in the media’s handling of New York Post reports on emails obtained from a laptop that Hunter Biden reportedly left off at a Delaware computer repair shop. Here was a story with enough mysteries and plotlines to keep a couple of newsrooms busy. Are the emails, putting Hunter Biden’s sleazy overseas business dealings in a more sinister light, legitimate? Did Hunter really take the laptop to the shop and forget about it? And, more importantly, what do the emails say about what Joe Biden knows or should have known about Hunter’s work that depended so heavily on proximity to the vice president?
 Instead, the press has been uninterested at best and hostile at worst. It’s the opposite of a feeding frenzy. The media has deployed its bomb disposal unit for fear that a potentially explosive story might detonate.
 What Biden has to say about the emails is inherently of interest. Yet, he wasn’t asked about it at his ABC News townhall last week. Never mind that his response would have made headlines afterward and the clip would have been shown in every TV segment about the debate.

An Israeli official predicted on Wednesday that the United States would announce another deal establishing ties between Israel and an Arab or Muslim country before the US election.
 "I have a reasonable basis to believe that the announcement will come before Nov. 3 - that, if you'll permit me, is what I understand from my sources," Regional Cooperation Minister Ofir Akunis told Israel's Army Radio.
 In a foreign-policy flourish ahead of his re-election bid, top aides to President Donald Trump this week escorted Israeli delegates to Bahrain and UAE delegates to Israel, cementing Israel's new, US-brokered relations with the Gulf states.
 US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Wednesday that the United States had begun the process of removing Sudan from its list of state sponsors of terrorism and was also working "diligently" to get Khartoum to recognize Israel.
 Israeli Intelligence Minister Eli Cohen told Israel's Channel 13 News that he believed Israel was "very close to normalizing ties with Sudan".
 Pompeo stopped short of saying Sudan's removal would be linked to whether it would agree to normalize relations with Israel.
 Akunis said several countries were candidates to normalize relations with Israel. He did not name these, saying that it was "customary" to let the first official word come from Washington.
 But US Ambassador to Israel David Friedman did not indicate any imminent diplomatic breakthrough.
 "More nations that are in the Arab League will normalize and make peace with Israel, I have no doubt, it is a certainty. How many, in what order, I think everyone is just going to have to wait and see," he told a conference hosted by Israel Hayom newspaper and the Kohelet Policy Forum think-tank.

Adds reaction from Europe minister, background)
 BERLIN, Oct 21 (Reuters) - German Health Minister Jens Spahn tested positive for the coronavirus on Wednesday afternoon, the health ministry said, adding that he had placed himself in home quarantine.
 The minister, 40, was suffering from cold-like symptoms, the ministry said. People he had been in contact with were being informed.
 While Germany's infection rates are lower than in much of Europe, they have been accelerating and hit a daily record of 7,830 on Saturday, according to the Robert Koch Institute, Germany's federal disease prevention agency.
 "My best wishes for @jensspahn," tweeted Europe Minister Michael Roth. "Hopefully he will be back on board soon. Healthy and committed. We need everyone and anything now in the fight against the #Corona."
 Spahn has urged Germans to stick to social distancing rules to keep infections at a manageable level.
 Earlire this month, he said Germans face a "test of character" to contain a surge in the number of coronavirus cases. (Reporting by Thomas Escritt Editing by Paul Carrel and Peter Graff)

Ballmer’s front office did exactly that. They were patient and consistent in recruiting Kawhi Leonard for a long time, and it had paid off in their landing not only Leonard but Paul George.
 Right now, George is “Playoff P,” the perennial postseason letdown whose own teammates reportedly rolled their eyes at him after the Clippers' postseason exit. But then, he was a two-way phenom coming off a top-three MVP finish as a player who had been in big playoff games since his young days in Indiana.
 The crazy thing to look at in retrospect amid the carnage of the Clippers postseason and offseason moves which culminated in the firing of head coach Doc Rivers and hiring of assistant Ty Lue is how much the Clippers got right.
 The constant criticism of the Milwaukee Bucks stems from what they _didn’t_ do. They may have hired Mike Budenholzer as their coach and built a deep, versatile roster, but they didn’t keep Malcolm Brogdon. They didn’t go far enough.
 The Clippers, however, went far enough. When they traded Chris Paul, they rebuilt their team with spare parts but good, fun players like Lou Williams, Montrezl Harrell, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Danilo Gallinari. That got them into the playoffs and gave them the pieces to acquire George from the Thunder. They were willing to give Williams a big extension. They made moves at the deadline to add Marcus Morris and Reggie Jackson.
 “You can’t look at the job they did and think the Clippers nailed any of the individual moves. What they were missing was something you can’t acquire or develop,” an Eastern Conference executive said this week.
 Ballmer at least has not fallen victim to the issues that have plagued so many owners: excessive loyalty.
 A team that finds success often is convinced that they just caught bad breaks and they should run it back. If your team is good, at all, you can always convince yourself that the team it was in its wins is the _real_ team, and the team its losses were just little things they needed to tweak, or the product of luck.

There are absolutely reasonable assertions to be made about who is on the floor with those two and what players they’re facing when they play together. The data, however, does signal that they don’t thrive together enough to think that it’s working.
 Much of this is obvious. Simmons is not a shooter, not now, maybe never. Embiid is a big man, who too often opts for letting the defense off the hook with mid-range jumpshots. Simmons is a demon in transition, Embiid is an unstoppable force when he actually gets his ass into the post as maybe the one player in the entire NBA whose ass belongs in the post full-time.
 The defense of that combination is that the Sixers surrounded the two with limited shooters despite having Al Horford (who shot above 35% from 3 each of the past three seasons), Josh Richardson (who shot above 35% in three of his five seasons), Tobias Harris (who shot 37% from 3 last season), Furkan Korkmaz (40% from 3), Raul Neto (39% from 3) and Shake Milton (43% from 3).
 Milton was installed in the starting unit in the restart to try and provide another shot-creator in the backcourt. The fact that with two players considered to be at the top level you are in need of a third creator should signal there’s a greater problem.

If Donald Trump is forced from the White House in the November election, he won't be the only loser.Though many governments would likely celebrate the end of the most unconventional and at times chaotic U.S. presidency of modern times, others will have reason to miss it. For the leaders of Turkey, North Korea and Israel, the ledger has been almost entirely positive. Trump's ejection would confront them with immediate challenges.The scorecard for countries like China is more nuanced. Even so, what the mostly authoritarian winners from Trump's four years in office have in common is a fear his departure would spell the return of a more conventional U.S. foreign policy.That could see the U.S. mending alliances and promoting the universality of values such as democracy and human rights, or the fight against climate change. "This president embraces all the thugs in the world," Trump's opponent Joe Biden said at a recent town hall event, as he sought to highlight the political divide.Kim Jong UnNo relationship with the U.S. changed more under Trump than North Korea's. What began with mutual threats and insults morphed into a sometimes bizarre love-in as Kim and Trump met three times and exchanged more than two dozen letters, showcasing their "mysteriously wonderful" chemistry.Still, the radically different U.S. approach has also failed to secure North Korea's denuclearization. Kim unveiled a huge new intercontinental ballistic missile on Oct. 10 that appears capable of delivering multiple nuclear warheads.Biden has said he won't meet without preconditions, making any rapid lifting of the sanctions that have tipped North Korea's economy into its worst recession for two decades less likely.Mohammed bin SalmanTrump set the tone for his approach to international relations in Saudi Arabia, choosing Riyadh for his first foreign visit in 2017. He was greeted by a huge image of his own face projected onto the facade of the palatial hotel where his delegation stayed.The Saudi Crown Prince made important gains, above all Trump's withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran, his country's mortal rival. Trump also offered personal support and vetoed Congressional sanctions when MBS, as he's known, was besieged by allegations he'd ordered the 2018 murder of prominent regime critic Jamal Khashoggi.There have been disappointments for Saudi, in particular Trump's failure to strike back militarily after a 2019 attack on oil facilities in eastern Saudi Arabia that the U.S. attributed to Iran. Saudi leaders say they're confident they could navigate a transition to Biden. Still, with Trump gone a more traditional U.S. focus on human rights is likely to return and a door could open to reviving the Iran accord.Recep Tayyip ErdoganIf anyone relies more on Trump than MBS for political protection, it's Turkey's president. Trump has stood virtually alone between Turkey and the imposition of Congressional sanctions over Erdogan's decision to buy Russia's S-400 air defense missile system, despite being a North Atlantic Treaty Organization ally.Their personal bond enabled Erdogan to persuade Trump to withdraw U.S. troops from Kurdish areas of Northern Syria so Turkey could send its own forces to take control of the zone. Trump made that decision without consulting the Pentagon or U.S. allies in the fight against Islamic State in Syria, including the U.K., France and Kurdish fighters that Turkey regards as terrorists.With sanctions ready for enforcement and Biden previously calling on the U.S. to support Turkish opposition parties, Erdogan may have the most to lose from Trump's departure.Xi JinpingTrump has been more aggressive toward China than any U.S. president in recent memory, slapping tariffs on Chinese goods and moving to restrict its access to key technologies. Yet Chinese officials have said on balance the leadership would prefer Trump to stay.Trump shook the system of post-World War II alliances that China sees as a constraint on its geopolitical ambitions, a considerable benefit. He also undermined America's international stature by exiting agreements in pursuit of "America First" policies, creating openings for the Chinese president to fill the resulting void of leadership on everything from trade to climate change.Beijing's concern about Biden is that he would try to create a more coordinated international front in dealing with China, while maintaining the pressure on trade and technology. Even so, China might benefit from a less emotive relationship with Washington if Trump loses, according to Zhu Feng, professor of international relations at Nanjing University. "Do people really want to see China and the U.S enter a cold war?"Vladimir PutinRussia's alleged meddling in the 2016 election produced a formal U.S. investigation and 448-page report. But in some ways, Putin hit the jackpot. In office, Trump has questioned the value of NATO and even the status of countries such as Germany as allies, weakening a transatlantic alliance that Russian and Soviet leaders back to Joseph Stalin have sought to break.There's every reason to think the trend would continue during a second Trump administration. Yet Russia's president secured few of the more concrete gains he wanted, from lifted sanctions to progress on arms control. Russian officials see few prospects for a thaw, and less so under a Biden administration.Rather than lament the anti- Russia mood, the Kremlin could try to change it, according to Fiona Hill, the National Security Council's senior director for European and Russian affairs until 2019. "They could rein in the guys who are going around poisoning people right, left and center," said Hill, now at the Brookings Institute. "When they're having meetings with us, they could not poke us in the eye. They could just stop doing all that."Jair BolsonaroFor Brazil's president, Trump is a political soul mate. As U.S. opinion polls have turned for Biden, Bolsonaro has grown increasingly concerned for the future of his ties with the White House, according to a senior cabinet member.Since taking office in 2019, Bolsonaro has upended Brazil's decades-old tradition of an equidistant foreign policy in favor of automatic alignment with the U.S. and its allies. In return, Trump lifted a ban on fresh-beef imports, supported Brazil's bid to join the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, and signed deals for defense and space-exploration cooperation.Foreign Minister Ernesto Araujo has said Brazil would have no problem with a Biden administration, but Bolsonaro's environmental policies would face strong opposition. Biden has suggested Brazil could face economic consequences if it does not stop Amazon deforestation.Benjamin NetanyahuTrump repeatedly broke with U.S. precedent to boost the Israeli leader's nationalist agenda, recognizing Israeli sovereignty in the disputed Golan Heights and moving the American embassy to Jerusalem. Plans to annex parts of the Palestinian West Bank have been shelved, but could be revived in a second Trump term.The real payoff came in September, when Trump brokered normalization deals between Israel and the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, but there's been a cost; bipartisan support for Israel in Congress has eroded. Many Israelis fear their country would face greater scrutiny under a Biden administration, while the security establishment worries about a U.S. return to the Iran nuclear deal.Andrzej Duda and Viktor OrbanOutsiders among more liberal European heads of state, the leaders of Poland and Hungary have found solace in Trump. In 2017 he chose Warsaw for a major speech in which he redefined the West in terms of conservative, Christian values -- validating Duda's right-wing agenda, which Hungary's Orban shares.The Hungarian prime minister has openly endorsed Trump ahead of the election, saying he does not want to see a return of the "moral imperialism" a Democratic administration would bring to the White House.The two men share Trump's disdain for political correctness in ways that could cause friction with Biden. President Duda has cast the LGBTQ+ community as "enemies" of Polish families. In September, Biden weighed in on Twitter against Polish regions that had declared themselves "free from LGBT ideology."In his comment on Trump's fondness for "thugs," Biden singled out Hungary and Poland, together with post-Soviet Belarus as he warned against risks to NATO from "the rise of totalitarian regimes around the world."
