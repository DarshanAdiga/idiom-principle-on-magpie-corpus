The Stanley Cup will be awarded on the ice, as per custom. Typically the celebration is hectic and crowded, with dozens of family members joining. This year, it will be much more intimate.
 The NHL made an agreement with players that their families would be able to join them by the conference finals. However, while the government in Alberta allowed exemptions for NHL teams and staffers to skirt the federally mandated 14-day quarantine, they have yet to allow clearances for family members. As of now, only Canadians living in Canada are allowed to come, and must quarantine for four days before entering.
 The Dallas Stars already have clinched a spot in the Stanley Cup Final. The Lightning-New York Islanders Eastern Conference finals series is ongoing, with Tampa Bay ahead 3-2 and Game 6 on Thursday night.
 As of Thursday, there is only one wife of a Stars player in the bubble, though the team says seven additional family members of players -- all Canadians, living in Canada -- will also join.
