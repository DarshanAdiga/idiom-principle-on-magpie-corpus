“Stents are used in radiation oncology [for head and neck cancers] to keep a patient’s mouth open and to push the tongue to the right or left side. Commercial products fall short when they don’t open the mouth wide enough or don’t push the tongue correctly,” Markovic told BizWest.

In light of these gains and the current valuation there is a sense that while Zoom has done very well this year, questions do need to be asked as to whether the company is worth over $120bn. For a start Zoom’s success has prompted its competitors to up their game, so the fledgling company could find it has to work that much harder to stand still as time goes by. This could well put the current valuation under slightly more scrutiny, among questions as to whether it’s sustainable at current levels. Q3 profits are expected to come in at $0.75c a share.

I think we've been clear with that all along and days like today help him, but there are still two further races. Sergio is doing the best possible job that he can to ensure that he remains under consideration, and today was Alex's good fortune with that podium. But Alex had a good day today, and of course there are still two further races to go."

TORINO (ITALPRESS) - E' giunta a conclusione l'operazione "Molosso" della Guardia di finanza, che ha riguardato gare truccate per 3,5 milioni, frodi nelle pubbliche forniture e corruzione all'interno delle Asl piemontesi.                                                                                                                                                                               Sequestrati beni per quasi 300.000 euro, eseguite 15 ordinanze di custodia cautelare personale nei confronti di pubblici dipendenti, commissari di gara ed agenti e rappresentanti di alcune imprese accusati, a vario titolo, di corruzione, turbativa d'asta e frode nelle pubbliche forniture. L'operazione aveva avuto un'accelerazione a maggio con una serie di perquisizioni, a seguito dell'accertamento di un ammanco, presso l'Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria "Citta della Salute e della Scienza di Torino", per un valore di circa trecento mila euro, di un costoso prodotto farmaceutico, denominato "Bon Alive". Un dipendente infedele apponeva firme false di altri infermieri, per il reintegro delle giacenze. Nel proseguo dell'inchiesta e emerso un collaudato ed articolato sistema di interazioni fra soggetti privati e commissari di gara finalizzato a truccare le gare d'appalto attraverso la modifica dei relativi capitolati, l'attribuzione di punteggi di favore e la rivelazione di informazioni riservate. Nel mirino della Procura della Repubblica e dei militari della Guardia di Finanza sono finite, in particolare, tre gare bandite: dalla "Citta di Torino" - ASL TO4, per la fornitura di camici chirurgici sterili monouso; dalla A.O.U. Maggiore della Carita di Novara, per la fornitura di distributori di "divise e giacche in TNT"; dalle ASL di Asti e di Alessandria, nonche dall'Azienda Ospedaliera SS Antonio e Biagio e C. Arrigo di Alessandria, per la fornitura di prodotti ed apparecchiature chemioterapiche.

Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers carved up the Bears defense, where Green Bay's offense scored four touchdowns in the red zone against the NFL's best red zone defense.

"The fact that Prince William has been approached to take over the role of Captain General of the Royal Marines previously held by Harry before he was stripped of his military appointments after stepping back from royal duty, suggests there is no expectation of a formal return to royal business for the Sussexes from either side,” she went on to say.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  "Instead it is more likely that the review will focus on the small print of what kind of commercial/media ventures the Sussexes might seek to be involved with and what the Palace might seek to prohibit,” she added.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  "And so, in short, the review will most likely formalise the split, at least for now, than signal the beginning of a rapprochement,” she said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Royal historian Robert Lacey was also of the same opinion as he said: "There are two titles involved, there is the HRH status and then there is the actual title of Duke and Duchess of Sussex.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  "Obviously if the review in March concludes they can't stay working royals, then it's quite likely they would lose or forfeit their HRH styles. They have already put it into suspension,” he said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  "The way it is presented at the moment is that they are HRH but they choose not to use it, it doesn't say that they are banned from using it,” he continued.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  "If this develops in the future, I think it will be presented in the same way - they choose not to be royals anymore,” he added.

Will a DOOH measurement system in India see the light soon? Patil feels, "The idea is already in practice but in silos and at a small scale. The DOOH measurement system in India is currently fragmented and it is a long road before it culminates into being one centralized unit of measurement."

Executive Chairman of Asianet News Media and Entertainment Private Limited, Rajesh Kalra pointed at the lack of programming differentiators across the news broadcasting business and said: "We are witnessing a shift in consumer behaviour over the recent past. It is important for news broadcasters to be sensitive to this shift. With shrinking attention span and ever-evolving viewership behaviour, presenting well-differentiated verified content will be the key to better engagement. Asianet Suvarna News is doing exactly that and will continue to deliver on the back of its well-researched content strategy."",

The Kerala State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) will effect crew change in all inter-State services from Tuesday, said Transport Minister A. K. Saseendharan.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  The decision comes in the wake of an accident involving a KSRTC super deluxe bus in which the driver was instantly killed and two, including the conductor, suffered serious injuries. The bus had rammed into a tree on the median at Chakkaraparambu along the Palarivattom Bypass on Monday around 4.15 am. The tree was uprooted and the bus was reduced to a rubble in the impact of the collision.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Palarivattom police attributed the accident prima facie to the possibility of the driver dozing off.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Talking to _The Hindu_ after visiting the accident site, Mr. Saseendharan said that the danger of operating long distance services with unchanged crew had been flagged even before. "So, we decided to effect a crew change immediately from Tuesday in all inter-State services. Either the crew will be changed along the route or a conductor-cum-driver will be deployed. In no case will a driver be made to drive for more than eight hours at a stretch," the Minister said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  He further said that the arrangement will be gradually effected in long distance services even within the State.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Mr. Saseendharan said that a department level inquiry has been ordered into the accident to find out the exact cause of the accident. The probe will look into whether any technical glitches triggered the accident or it happened because the driver dozed off as has been suspected.

After producing a brilliant stop to deny Steven Taylor from close range at the hour-mark, the Malayali keeper handled the ball outside the box and received his marching orders.

Sandeep Goyal, Founder, Mogae Media, lauded the decision as he feels that it is imperative to formulate guidelines for endorsement of such products. He added that there have to be visible penalties including possible imprisonment as deterrents, otherwise the malaise will persist. "The Hon'ble Court is completely correct in granting restraint. Self-regulation is a myth. No one actually exercises it. Not brands, not ad agencies, not the AAAI, not ASCI, not the TV channels, not the IBF. The attempt in fact is to push the envelope till someone objects or the Law intervenes. Sad, but true. But 'restraint' again means repeatedly running to the Courts for making sure the objectionable stuff remains off-air. The moral fibre of the advertising business has eroded to such an extent that courts need to intervene for course correction. This is indeed sad," he remarked.

We wanted to enhance the customer experience and provide 24x7 support on general queries which can be addressed by 'Quree' (The Chatbot)." Generally, patients visiting a doctor have a few queries that remain unanswered or may need more information at the time of usage of a product. Not always can they find accurate information on search engines or call their doctor again for all their little doubts. "This was the starting point of the chatbot idea. We wanted to provide accurate information, allay their fears and build a community too. It made more sense considering the pandemic affected world where questions are many and misinformation is rampant," he added. "Being a young organization helps us relate and resonate with the current and trending technologies to communicate with our customers.

Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Email Print ERIE — You’d be forgiven if you took a tour of Zelios Colorado LLC’s back rooms and thought they were a brewery. The dozens of tall, stainless steel tanks connected by pipes and wires seem at first glance like the birthplace of craft beer. But really, they’re separating CBD and other cannabinoids from hemp plants at a scale that may not be rivalled anywhere else in the country. In this nondescript business park that’s shared with carpenters and plane hangars, Zelios Colorado now claims to be the biggest white-label extractor of CBD in the country. From developers to CBD distillers CEO Zach Nassar, 31, was first in real estate with his father David Nassar, a stock trader, winery owner and owner of Nassar Development LLC. The company built the park that now houses Zelios’ operations at 3000 Airport Drive, Suite 203. The first customer in the park was Pete Cummings, the founder of Zelios, who brought in six carbon-dioxide extractors and set up shop right as hemp was on the verge of federal legalization in late 2018. Nassar didn’t know anything about CBD at that point, but learned about the process of extracting it as he led the buildout of Cummings’ project. With that knowledge in tow, he set up Gemini Extraction, which extracted CBD with ethanol and complemented Zelios’ products. While CBD is in its infancy as a national industry, competition has skyrocketed in the past several months. Nassar said the price of isolate was a whopping $8,000 per kilogram around the beginning of 2019 and shrunk to $800 per kilogram within a year. “Both us and Pete came to the realization that if we’re really going to be a dominant  force in this industry, we got to come together and build a bigger company and do what we’re doing at a pretty big scale,” Nassar said. After Zelios and Gemini closed a merger in March that brought on current chief operating officer Alex Goff, 27, the race to grow was on. Cummings, who is Australian, remains on Zelios’ board of directors, but lives in Hong Kong and owns international toymaker Zing Toys. Nassar estimates that the company will pull in revenues of $15 million to $20 million between March 2020 and March 2021. Processing Zelios’ warehouses use two different systems for extraction, spanning 25,000 square feet and 16 machines, including six almost brand-new ones added in a recent expansion. One of the systems forces highly pressurized carbon dioxide to separate cannabinoids from impurities in the raw material, while the other uses extremely cold ethanol to sap CBD and other desired compounds from the biomass and is later distilled to steam off the ethanol and leave behind the desired material. Between the two systems and approximately 10 members of the production staff, Nassar estimates that the company can process up to 8,500 pounds of hemp in an eight-hour shift and extract about 200 kilograms of isolate per day.

“We are an essential service I suppose because we have to keep the horses fed and keep them exercised and keep everything going so maybe not as much has changed for me as it has for everyone else. We take all the precautions we can in work with social distancing and we've put in extra toilet and handwashing facilities and we wear masks to ride out so everything that can be done is being done. And from the racing point of view we had a small shut down in February/March but we were lucky enough to get back racing behind closed doors. It was a little bit eerie at the start with no crowds but it’s something we’ve all gotten used to and I think we are all just grateful to be racing really. Of course it would be fantastic to have the crowds and the owners there but just to be racing at all is fantastic.

Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Email Print The next nine years will prove how committed local electricity utilities are to the cause of developing new renewable energy sources. It’s put-up-or-shut-up time. Many of the Boulder Valley and Northern Colorado electricity providers and local governments have circled 2030 as the year when they’ll deliver on promises to transition completely or mostly away from carbon-based sources of power. Cities such as Boulder and Longmont have passed resolutions to provide 100% renewable energy to residents by 2030, while utilities such as Xcel Energy Inc. (NYSE: XEL) and Poudre Valley Rural Electric Association Inc. have pledged to get 80% there. Platte River Power Authority spokesman Steve Roalstad said the push for renewables has been “customer driven,” and utilities and local leadership have bought into the process. “I’ve got to hand it to Platte River and the people in this community for saying, ‘Let’s give it a whirl,’” he said. Interestingly, PRPA produced 100% renewable energy up until the 1970s using a hydroelectric power plant, Roalstad said. But eventually, the booming Northern Colorado region outgrew the plant’s capacity. “With the advent of the use of air conditioning in Colorado, the demand curve changed drastically,” he said, and utilities turned to natural gas and coal to meet this demand. Now the industry, facing pressure from leaders and residents to address climate change, is moving away from those carbon-based energy sources. To replace coal and gas, utilities are looking to wind and solar energy. PRPA added 30 megawatts of solar power at its Rawhide Station outside of  Wellington in 2016. The association then added 225 megawatts of new wind power this year and hopes to add another 22 megawatts of solar in the next month or so. PRPA also expects to enter into a new power purchase agreement to bring on additional solar in the coming year. By 2024, the utility hopes to produce 60% of its electricity from renewables. Solar-generated electricity doesn’t have to be bought as part of a power purchase agreement; it can come from a utility’s own customers. “One of things we’re seeing is more customer use of small scale residential solar panels on their own homes,” Longmont Power & Communications spokesman Scott Rochat said. Two years ago, the utility had 234 solar customers, he said. This year, the total is up to 400 “It’s quick growth.” In October, PRPA’s board of directors approved its 2020 integrated resource plan. The IRP studied multiple options to achieve 100% noncarbon and selected what it called Portfolio 2. This path eliminates coal generation but maintains some natural-gas generation, along with wind and solar, in order to hold down costs while maintaining reliability. Xcel is in a unique position to be held accountable for its carbon reduction promises. Boulder voters approved a deal in November that provides a pathway for the city to end its decade-long effort to form a municipal utility and re-enter a franchise agreement with Xcel. Xcel agreed to reduce its 2005 carbon-emission levels by 80% […]

While the economic rebound appears to have been driven primarily by consumption and increased investment, the second quarter also saw a marked decline in government expenditure - reportedly a result of the government stimulus interventions that front-loaded income support and wage payments. Through a swathe of monetary policy interventions intended to boost liquidity and build confidence within lending markets, it is the RBI, and its monetary policy levers, that have, by and large, done the majority of the heavy lifting. Some analysts are of the view that, in the absence of further government expenditure, the improvements witnessed in Q2 may not last in the upcoming quarters.

Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Email Print LOVELAND — Time waits for no one, or so said Keith Richards and Mick Jagger of the Rolling Stones in a song of that name. The same is true of technology. Yet sometimes people wait for technology to catch up. Medical technologists in multiple fields have been laboring since the advent of 3D printing in manufacturing to apply its principles to medicine. And having success. Consider: This year, a Cleveland Clinic doctor received FDA approval for 3D-printed airway stents designed to fit the individual patient. Doctors have begun to use 3D printed models of their patients’ anatomies in order to exactly fit coronary stents. And in October, the Australian National Science Agency reported the development of 3D printed coronary stents used to treat Peripheral Arterial Disease. Closer to home, medical professionals at Banner MD Anderson Cancer Centers at McKee Medical Center in Loveland and North Colorado Medical Center in Greeley have begun to use 3D technology to create devices to improve the treatment of patients needing radiation therapy. Alexander Markovic, PhD, a physicist with Banner, turned to his 3D printing hobby when a friend undergoing treatment needed help. “Stents are used in radiation oncology [for head and neck cancers] to keep a patient’s mouth open and to push the tongue to the right or left side. Commercial products fall short when they don’t open the mouth wide enough or don’t push the tongue correctly,” Markovic told BizWest. “One of my friends was coming into our department, and she couldn’t open her mouth wide enough,” he said. Without a stent, patients can move their jaws around “and that’s not good,” he said. The purpose of the stent is to rigidly position the jaw and teeth in the correct position so that the radiation can be directed at the cancerous tissue each and every time treatment occurs and avoid healthy tissue. Markovic had been playing around with 3D printing as a hobby and making cases to hold electronics, toys for kids, and parts to fix things around the house. “I might have an artist inside of me. I like to be able to print something that I design, an object that I can hold. I thought maybe I could create a line of these [stents] that could be available in different sizes to fit the patient,” Markovic said. Commercial stents come in limited sizes. Using a computer-aided design program similar to programs that dentists use, he set out to create stents. The same printer that previously produced toy tanks and guns for kids created 10 or 15 configurations of re-usable stents. It takes about eight hours to produce one, so he can quickly output a model specific for a patient if something in stock doesn’t quite fit. Then, using dental trays to hold impression material, technologists create an impression of the patient’s teeth so that the stent will go back into the mouth exactly the same way with each radiation treatment. Two prongs help the stent integrate […]
