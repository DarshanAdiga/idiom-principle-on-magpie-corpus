Ouattara maintained he could run again because of a constitutional referendum in 2016.

"The real Mamaw was taller than me, bigger than me, had big hands," Close said. "If anything, I kind of downplayed how larger than life she was because I thought it would unbalance the movie in a way."
 The transformation was a success. Close received validation when Mamaw's own son visited the set of Hillbilly Elegy.
 "Mamaw's son came to the set, and when he saw me, he had to leave because it was such an emotional experience for him," Close said. "He actually thought he saw Mamaw."
 Close said she also was moved by some of Adams' scenes, citing, for example, one of J.D.'s flashbacks in which Bev cuts her wrist after the death of her father, Mamaw's husband.
 "At one point, she looks up at the sky and she says, 'Can't anyone help me?'" Close said. "It just tore me up because I think of all the people around the world right now saying exactly that."
 For Adams, the most harrowing scenes were when Bev lashes out at young J.D. Adams said she has remained close with Asztalos since filming, keeping in touch via Zoom.
 "I was so protective of him, and then I'd be calling him names," Adams said. "It was devastating to be swearing at this very sweet, very open young man."
 Hillbilly Elegy is in theaters Wednesday and on Netflix Nov. 24.

Presley's huge performance against B.T. Washington was his second of the 2020 season. In a matchup of No. 1 teams on Oct. 2, he rushed for 305 yards and six TDs, pacing the Spartans’ 56-14 win at Carl Albert, the four-time defending Class 5A champion.
 “He always comes up huge in our biggest games,” Bixby coach Loren Montgomery said. “That’s what you expect from your star players.”
 Against Booker T. Washington, he totaled 201 rushing yards, 155 receiving yards and 57 kick-return yards. He averaged 15.3 yards for each of the 27 times he touched the ball.
 "But he was still the same person Friday morning," Montgomery said. "He was up here bright and early, ready to lift weights and wanting to work to make himself better."

Thanksgiving is right around the corner, and for anyone wondering if it's safe to gather with friends and family amid the pandemic, there may be some good news. Emphasis on "some."By and large, health experts say it's best to stay home this year, especially with coronavirus cases surging nationwide.Updated safety guidelines published by the CDC on Monday note that small gatherings are "an important contributor" to the spike in infection rates. The agency recommends that older adults and others at heightened risk of severe illness avoid being around people outside their households.That said, if it is necessary to travel for the holiday, experts suggest gathering outdoors. They also advise planning ahead to reduce the risks associated with the virus. This includes quarantining for two weeks starting Thursday and getting tested for the disease with enough time to receive the results.A recent survey by the travel site Tripadvisor found that around 56% of people in the U.S. are planning to travel for Thanksgiving.

The number of players in quarantine was troubling enough for LSU to begin preparing for the Arkansas game on Monday instead of Alabama.
 At the time, Orgeron said they didn't believe the game was going to happen. Then, on Tuesday, there was brief hope and they switched back to Alabama preparation before the final word finally arrived just before Tuesday's practice.
 It's still possible that LSU's game at Arkansas next week is also in jeopardy.
 When Florida had to postpone its game against LSU because of an outbreak within its program, the Gators had to also postpone its game against Missouri that following week because players were still in 14-day quarantine.
 LSU's open week seems to have provided a favorable window. Orgeron said he's heard the quarantined players "will be back sometime next week," and pegged next Tuesday or Wednesday as the days he'll have an answer.
 "We'll have a lot more players at practice next week than we have this week," he said.
