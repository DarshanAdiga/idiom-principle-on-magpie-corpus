There's something to be said a lot of old school beat'em-ups. The best ones had a unique taste that could often remind players of hokey B-movie action flicks. Whether it was the mullets, the muscles, or the sheer amount of different goons facing heroes down, we played it out to the end whether it meant earning continues through points or grabbing an allowance full of quarters. Shadow Gangs is a title coming from JKM Corp and if any of the above sounds good to you, then you have to see the trailer released ahead of the game's April 2020 launch.

MATLAB functions written for HDL Coder export have differences and limitations when compared to a typical MATLAB function. While both are similarly formatted, functions which will be used with HDL Coder should be written with the understanding that the code will be converted to an HDL representation. This approach helps to ensure that the HDL export can meet performance requirements – such as speed or resource usage – once imported into LabVIEW FPGA.

La speranza è quella che fra due settimane si possa ripartire, con la consapevolezza che la situazione in Italia sia migliorata, ma questo ovviamente spetterà dirlo a dottori e virologi, non certamente a noi tesserati, che dovremmo solo adeguarci a quelle che saranno le decisioni».

YORK, Maine -- Two candidates are vying for a single seat on the York School Committee this year, in the only contested race heading into the town's May 16 election.
   
 David Herbein, the incumbent, is finishing up his first term on the committee. He's being challenged by Joseph Amend.
   
 Herbein, a retired naval engineer whose five children graduated from the York school system beginning in 1992, said he is seeking reelection to provide continuity to the committee.
   
 "There is a tremendous amount of work put in behind the scenes by the committee members," he said. "In the first year, you're trying to figure out what this job is all about. In the second year, you think you know. But it's really not until the third year that your feet are firmly on the ground and you understand how a school committee works in the State of Maine."
   
 When asked about some of the challenges the York School Committee faces, Herbein referenced the turnover in the Special Education Department.
   
 "We lost our Director of Special Education in November," he said, "and that is an area that needs to function at a high level, as it delivers services where they are most needed."
   
 Other areas that will require the committee's attention, Herbein said, are revisiting the school department's strategic plan and issues related to declining enrollment. Herbein said last fall that the reasons for declining enrollment, especially in higher grade levels, remain unclear.
   
 Enrollment is just one of the issues that challenger Amend aims to address. Amend, an Air Force veteran who served in Vietnam, has lived in York for 12 years. Prior to moving to that, he worked in private industry, implementing IT projects, according to his bio.
   
 Asked why he is running, Amend said, "I want to do something for York, to use my talent, education and professional background to benefit the town."
   
 Amend said he has seen statistics showing that the York school system once ranked eighth in the state but has fallen to 18th.
   
 "That should not happen," he said, adding the he's met some of the young students, and they seem well-rounded, but they "are missing some of the core elements schools should be teaching, like civics and American history." Many kids "are unable to do math in their heads," he added.
   
 Amend also referenced the "1619 Project," a series by The New York Times that confronts the role of slavery in this country.
   
 "That project is going to be introduced into the New York City schools, and it is not accurate," Amend said.
   
 Some historians have criticized certain parts of the series, particularly for its suggestion that the American Revolution was in large part fought to preserve slavery in the colonies. In an opinion piece published by Politico earlier this month, Northwestern University Professor Leslie M. Harris wrote that she had warned the Times that "critics would use the overstated claim to discredit the entire undertaking."
   
 In his bio, Amend describes education as "the future of our civilization" and children as "a treasure beyond all measure."
   
 Amend said he believes his organizational experience and realistic vision, along with his ability to appreciate and work with others for a common goal, will serve him and the town well.
   
 The uncontested races in this year's town elections are for two positions on the Board of Selectmen, sought by incumbents Robert E. Palmer Jr. and Elizabeth Blanchard; two positions on the Budget Committee, sought by incumbent Michael D. Spencer and newcomer Marla W. Johnson; one town moderator position sought by incumbent Russell Osgood; one water district trustee position sought by incumbent and current President Richard E. Boston; one sewer district trustee position sought by incumbent Nicholas Donis.

“It’s not clear to me that doing a massive shutdown of the entire state would even work. I think you are seeing, in some of the states that have done this, there has really been huge noncompliance,” DeSantis said. “In New York City, it’s like the party never ended. You have got people congregating all over the place. You see images from California, in Orange County. I don’t think the beaches have ever been so crowded, with people going out. Again, these are people who have been ordered to shelter in place, and they are not complying with those orders. The fact of the matter is, a governor is not going to start imprisoning people just because they leave their house. So, you are going to have a lot of noncompliance.”

Dear Dave,   In light of recent events in our country, do you have suggestions for things people should think about and plan for if they get laid off from their jobs?   Sam
 Dear Sam,   It's no secret that things are shutting down all across the world. If your workplace has closed its doors and isn't offering pay, then it's time to regroup and get some things in order. The thought of being without a paycheck can be overwhelming, but a little thought and planning can help you get through times like these.
 Start living on a budget, if you aren't doing so already. Making a monthly budget will show you exactly where your money is going. Without it, you can't use every dollar to its fullest potential, because you don't even know how much money you have to work with. Plus, your budget will show places where you can cut back and save money.
 If you don't have any income right now, make a budget based on the amount of money on hand. If you have $600 left to your name, budget out exactly where each of those dollars will go. It's time to squeeze every last penny out of what you've got. If you still have cash coming in from a spouse's job or some other source, then adjust your budget to reflect that. Maybe the two of you usually bring in a combined $5,000 a month. Adjust your budget to live off that one income for the time being.
 When the going gets tough, you need to focus on the things you really need to survive - food, utilities, shelter and transportation. I call these the Four Walls. If there's any money left over after you take care of the Four Walls, make a list of what else you need to pay, and tackle those in order of importance. Reach out to anyone you can't pay, and explain the situation. They might be able to work something out, but they can't help if they don't know. Be upfront with them, and pray for the best.
 When you're just trying to make it to another day, you don't need to pay extra on debt. Instead, focus on piling up cash. Once life gets back to normal and everything is okay, you can pick up where you left off with your debt snowball. If it's within your budget to keep making minimum payments on your debt, go for it. But the Four Walls come first. This is also the time to sell anything and everything you don't need to make some extra cash.
 With so much being shut down right now, there might not be as many traditional ways to make extra money. So, look into driving for Amazon, delivering takeout food or dropping off grocery orders. Even if one of those doesn't work out, you can still take up odd jobs around your neighborhood. Be on the lookout for opportunities that will add a few extra bucks to your pocket. Don't forget to cut back on unnecessary expenses, either. Stop or pause your subscriptions. Call your cable, internet and cellular providers to see if there's anything they'll do to work with you.
 Finally, in times of real need, don't be too proud to ask for a helping hand. Many churches and community groups in your area exist for situations just like this.
 God bless you all!   Dave
