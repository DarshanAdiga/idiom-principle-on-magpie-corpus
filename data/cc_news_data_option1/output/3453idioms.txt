Presenters and performers at the VMAs didn’t shrink from referring to the ongoing protests against racial injustice or the altered reality of the pandemic; they featured them.
 At the top of the show, host Keke Palmer addressed Black Lives Matter; The Weeknd, in collecting his two trophies of the night, said both times it was difficult for him to celebrate, calling instead for justice for Jacob Blake and Breonna Taylor. Lady Gaga put her costumers to work on designing extravagant masks, and backup dancers performed masked as well. DaBaby incorporated references to both PPE and the police into his act. Presenter Anthony Ramos (of “Hamilton”) donned a mask emblazoned with the word “VOTE.” The effect was not one of beating the audience over the head with political messages but of acknowledging the 800-pound gorillas in the room and, in Gaga’s case, dancing with them.
 The Emmys would do well to follow suit and embrace topical statements during the ceremony. It would be a welcome human touch in an era of enforced distance.

An insecticide about to be widely deployed inside African homes to combat malaria-carrying mosquitoes is already losing its punch. Two years ago, the World Health Organization (WHO) gave the green light for clothianidin, long used in agriculture to kill crop pests, to be added to the current mainstays of indoor mosquito control, which are losing their effectiveness as the insects develop resistance. Since then, many African countries have been laying plans to spray the walls of homes with the pesticide—it would represent the first new class of chemicals adopted for such use in decades—and looking anxiously for evidence of pre-existing resistance.

Armstrong also requested documents pertaining to the former Bradford Dyeing Association property from Jan. 1, 2019 to May 1, 2019; documents pertaining to a condominium development on South Drive from Jan. 1, 2019, to May 1, 2019; and documents pertaining to the municipal Comprehensive Plan and its preparation from May 1, 2018, to May 1, 2019.
 The request sought documents sent to or from Pellegrini, Letendre, who is now the town planner, Town Manager J. Mark Rooney and real estate developers and their representatives. In addition to emails and other documents, the request also sought copies of text messages.
 While serving on the Planning Board, Armstrong raised questions about the rules and duties of the town's planning staff, particularly the role of the director of development services. During an interview Friday, Armstrong said those concerns coupled with the departure of two town planners in a 15-month period contributed to his decision to seek the documents.
 "This was the culmination of the environment and atmosphere that was going on while I was chair of the board ... It seemed that that was basically a toxic environment that these two planers lived under," he said.
 Armstrong said he continues to be concerned that the town's job description of the development services director, and the authority the position has over the town planner is problematic because it conflicts with state law. While the town may have a need for the development services director position, Armstrong said the director cannot attempt to influence the planner's decisions or how they perform their duties.
 Letendre was appointed town planner by Rooney. She was selected from a pool of five applicants that met criteria established for the position and received a unanimous recommendation from a screening panel, of members of the planning, zoning and architectural review boards.
 Following Armstrong's initial request, the town extended the initial 10-day response time by an additional 20 days as permitted under the state Access to Public Records Act. On the last day of the deadline extension, the town gave documents to Armstrong on a flash drive. Armstrong reviewed the material he received and wrote to the town saying no texts or emails on town business from private servers was included on the thumb drive. He also asserted that memos, agendas and other documents were missing.
 According to Neronha's letter, Armstrong was informed on June 13, 2019, by Town Clerk Donna Giordano, the town's designated APRA officer, that the town's response was complete. Later that same day, according to the letter, Giordano informed Armstrong that she had learned from Pellegrini that her department and the town's information technology department had "miscommunicated" concerning the contents of the flash drive and inadvertently failed to include the missing material cited by Armstrong.
 On June 17, 2019, the town provided a second flash drive to Armstrong and informed him that 191 email communications were not provided "because they were between town staff and legal counsel for the town, and thus protected by the attorney-client privilege," according to Neronha's letter. Shortly after Armstrong filed a complaint with Neronha's office.
 "Once they did start giving me stuff it was in dribs and drabs. They asserted that they gave me everything in one thumb drive and then they looked at it and obviously they had not complied with what I requested. Then they said 'we messed up,'" Armstrong said.

CHARLOTTE, N.C. (WBTV) - Kinyata Adams Brown has two sons in Charlotte Mecklenburg Schools - and they are big fans of the Black Panther.“Black Panther everything, we have all the action figures, the face mask.We distinctly remember going to the movie theater,” says Brown. “Walking out with such a profound impact on all of us.”The news of her son’s favorite superhero actor - Chadwick Boseman’s passing, spread quickly Friday.Brown says its a tough conversation to broach.“We never knew that that his illness was something that was significantly impacting him that much that it stopped him from having a bigger purpose, right?” says Brown.Brown saw it as opportunity to explain to her boys how Boseman’s life on and off the screen can inspire them.“This story about persevering, although it’s really challenging and it’s sometimes it’s hard….that doesn’t mean you you give up,” says Brown. “I think that’s a really a good, transferable way [to look at it] that’s kid friendly.”Its an approach she’d like to see CMS incorporate into their social emotional learning curriculum, while they’re remote.“I’m really happy that their teachers actually they integrate it into the beginning of each of their days,” says Brown praising her sons SEL curriculum thus far.CMS has a district-wide curriculum for grades K-8 called Caring School Community.Students meet in the morning, incorporate social, emotional learning throughout the day, and end with a daily closing circle along with weekly class meetings.CMS says in that curriculum educators are given resources on how to approach dicussing tragedy and grief with students.The district says they encourage conversations about Boseman’s death for healthy and meaningful conversations about grief and strength.Copyright 2020 WBTV.

You reap what you sow, no disrespect but it is what is. When I retired I moved to a town where open carry is the norm. And when the whole plandemic hit it was hilarious to everybody that we had to don a mask with our guns in order to enter a bank. The icing on the cake is when an ANTIFA bus stopped in town it was met by an articulate and well armed individual who advised them to move on. It was widely reported they were met by a far right militia, but the fact of the matter is, it was just a single citizen who stepped up. He is also the best barber in town, but I may be prejudiced because he cuts my hair.

Images of packed beaches, lakes and bars have made the rounds on traditional and social media for much of the summer, drawing scorn from those concerned about the coronavirus spreading among those crowds.
 Less prominent but also troubling are the growing instances of case clusters arising from smaller gatherings.
 Contact tracing yields information about the sources of infections as the USA, by far the world leader in total COVID-19 cases and deaths, grapples with how to keep its population safe while propping up a flagging economy. More than 182,000 Americans have been killed by the disease.
 The hasty reopening of businesses across much of the nation after the spring shutdown was largely blamed for a summer surge in infections, but social functions of various sizes among relatives, friends and co-workers may have been a contributing factor as well.
 Public health experts sound the alarm as the Labor Day weekend approaches.
 "People don't think of it in the same way as the (President) Trump rally in Tulsa, a bunch of people on the beach or in the bars, but these small events add up to a lot. It's just invisible," said Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, a professor of medicine at the University of California-San Francisco who specializes in infectious diseases.
 There's no generally accepted definition of what's a small gathering - it may range from five to 30 people - and the majority of these activities take place behind closed doors. That makes it difficult to garner hard data about them.
 In late July, Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan said contact tracing revealed 44% of those testing positive for the virus in the state reported attending a family activity and 23% a house party, but the size of the events was not specified.
 Plenty of anecdotal evidence supports the notion that getting together with people outside the immediate household, even in fairly limited numbers, can lead to a rash of infections. Chin-Hong said several of the COVID-19 patients he treated believe they caught the virus at barbecues.
 Weddings have been more troublesome, including a 100-guest event in San Francisco in early July that resulted in at least 10 people contracting the virus, among them the bride and groom.
 Smaller events, such as family, office and graduation parties, have yielded COVID-19 cases as well.
 In Alabama, eight of 11 relatives who went to a lake house together in July tested positive for the coronavirus.
 In the Washington, D.C., area, the host of a backyard dinner in June for about 25 came down with COVID-19, as did some of her guests.
 And in Houston, seven members of a family that went out for a Fathers' Day meal developed COVID-19.
 "Small gatherings are a concern because there's so many of them. They may account for a much greater proportion of the cases than we think right now,'' said Dr. George Rutherford, a colleague of Chin-Hong's at UCSF and the principal investigator for California's contact tracing program.
 Rutherford emphasized the need for those planning to attend or host functions on Labor Day weekend to practice social distancing and wear masks as much as possible, but he's even more wary of what may be in store after Thanksgiving.
 Extended families traditionally convene on that holiday, often after traveling from far away, and sit around for long stretches, be it eating or watching NFL games on TV. The dinners are almost always held indoors, where limited ventilation makes it easier to contract the virus.
 "Everybody's going to be there with their belts undone and the top button off their pants, snoring and laying without masks on watching football in some tiny little den," Rutherford said. "It's not a pretty picture. There could be a lot of transmission. And Christmas is going to be exactly the same. It's unfortunate, but this is not the year for family gatherings."
 Given human nature, it's nearly impossible to prevent them.
 Matt Lambert, an emergency room physician based in Washington, D.C., said he would advise against any gatherings bigger than 25 people, small enough for the hosts to inquire about symptoms before the event.
 Those seeking to congregate for special occasions could take extreme measures, like a couple Lambert heard of who held their wedding at a zoo, where the staff enforced distancing regulations.
 Even then, it's hard to keep people apart.
 "We're not made that way," Lambert said. "You get extended loved ones together, especially at a wedding, and there's going to be some hugging going on."
 Lambert said he has treated patients who contracted the virus at a dinner with only eight participants, although he noted the party was held indoors and guests sat close to each other.
 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization posted guidelines for gatherings, and Chin-Hong said relatively safe barbecues can be held if the hosts and guests take precautions.
 He pointed out that, besides mask usage, the main determinants of risk when people assemble are the size of the group, the type and duration of the activity, where it's held (indoors or outdoors), whether alcohol is served, whether there is shouting or singing and how well participants know each other.
 Chin-Hong suggested inviting no more than two or three groups, each from a single household, and having them stay in their own "pods," at least 6 feet apart from the other participants. The event should be outdoors, hand sanitizer should be readily available, and either a host wearing a mask should serve the food, or the members of each pod could serve themselves while maintaining distance from the rest. Anybody using the bathroom should wear a mask.
 "It's fine to have a barbecue if you do it in a modest way and think about these risk aspects of keeping the pods apart from each other," Chin-Hong said. "I'm not against barbecues at all, but you can make it safer by not having a big event. Don't try to have a class reunion barbecue right now."
