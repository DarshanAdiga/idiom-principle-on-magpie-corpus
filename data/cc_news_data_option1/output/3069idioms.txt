Further documents provided, a literature review and a PowerPoint presentation, lacked the methodology and independent statistical analysis of a robust clinical trial or academic review which the ASA expected an advertiser to hold in order to substantiate such claims.
 The ASA ruling said: "Similarly, the PowerPoint presentation referred to clinical publications which we had not been provided with.
 "The treatment outcomes were considered up to two years, which we felt was insufficient to demonstrate the permanent pain relief that was implied by the ad.
 "In light of the above, we concluded that the claims, as consumers were likely to understand them, namely that the treatments listed in the ad were able to provide permanent relief to those who suffered from arthritis and persistent joint pain, had not been substantiated and were therefore misleading."

  Irving Young, a real estate investor, who retired from his job with Oakland County public schools, voted on the GOP side, saying he cast a ballot for Lucido.


  “I voted for Pete Lucido,” he said “He seems like an aggressive guy and someone who would be good for the job.”

  For Macomb County Board of Commissioners, 10 of the 13 districts featured primary race in one in both parties to advance to November to try to win a two-year term.


  Four the seats will be filled be non-incumbents due to four current commissioners not running for re-election, with three of them featuring other elective office.


  At press time, it appeared the two Democratic commissioners from Warren were being ousted.


  Long-time Commissioner Marv Sauger was ousted from his Second District seat by Mai Xiong in the Democratic primary. Xiong collected 37.3 percent of the votes compared to 24.5 percent for Sauger. Three other Democratic candidates were splitting the remainder of the vote. Xiong wins the right to face lone Republican Peter Fuciarelli.


  Xiong, 35, owns Mai & Co. clothing store in Warren and publishes the Simple Coupon Deals blog.


  Sauger, 83, a retired sergeant from the county Sheriff's Office, served as 10 two-yeaer terms.


  In addition, the First District race remains up in the air, with incumbent Andrey Duzyj narrowly losing the Democratic primary to Michelle Nard, who received 35.2 percent while Duzyj received 33.3 percent, with the 24 of 26 precincts reporting. A third Democrat, Terry Wisniewski, was till in the race with 31.5 percent of the vote. The winner will face the lone Republican, Mary Ellen Childs.


  In the 10th District, comprised of St. Clair Shores and Harrison Township, incumbent Democratic Commissioner Robert Leonetti overcame an early deficit and prevailed over former county employee Carol Grant in a somewhat close race, 52.8 percent to 47.2 percent.


  Leonetti will face lone Republican primary candidate Barbara Zinner in November.

 LITTLE ROCK Arkansas' revenue at the start of fiscal year surpassed expectations despite the coronavirus pandemic, state finance officials said Tuesday
 The Department of Finance and Administration said the state's net available revenue collections in July totaled $665.9 million, which was $203.1 million higher than the same month last year and $52.7 million above what was forecast for the month. Arkansas' fiscal year began July 1.
 The department said all of the state's major tax collection categories were above forecast, led by sales tax collections. The state collected $236.4 million in sales taxes last month, which was $30.7 million above the same month last year and $32.5 million above forecast.
 Individual income tax collections last month totaled nearly $440 million. Collections were $207.5 million higher than last year, which was due to the state moving the tax filing deadline from April to July because of the coronavirus pandemic. Collections were $17.6 million higher than forecast.
 The state collected $52.8 million in corporate income taxes, which was $27.7 million higher than the same month last year and $23.7 million above forecast.
 SPRINGDALE Tyson Foods Inc. (TSN) on Monday reported a fiscal third-quarter profit of $527 million.
 On a per-share basis, the Arkansas-based company said it had profit of $1.44. Earnings, adjusted for non-recurring gains, came to $1.40 per share.
 The results exceeded Wall Street expectations. The average estimate of four analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research was for earnings of 90 cents per share.
 The meat producer posted revenue of $10.02 billion in the period, which did not meet Street forecasts. Three analysts surveyed by Zacks expected $10.6 billion.
 Tyson shares have dropped 33% since the beginning of the year, while the Standard & Poor's 500 index has climbed 1%. The stock has decreased 24% in the last 12 months.

 West, who once backed Republican President Donald Trump, announced last month that he had broken with Trump and would launch his own presidential bid.
 West has since submitted paperwork to appear on the ballot in neighboring Oklahoma. A formal complaint was filed in New Jersey last week challenging the signatures he submitted to appear on that state's ballot.
 West's wife, reality TV star and beauty mogul Kim Kardashian West, asked the public on social media last month to show compassion and empathy toward her husband because he is bipolar.

In a letter to Missouri Office of Workforce Development authorities published late last week, Wyndham Vacation Ownership's Branson outfit confirmed that since early April, the company has furloughed or permanently laid off 191 employees.
   
 Within that total, 126 employees were permanently laid off, according to the letter by Wyndham officials. Affected job categories included human resources, accounting, marketing and sales, according to the letter.
   
 The most recent job actions took place on July 3 and July 27, Wyndham officials said.
   
 "We apologize that we were unable to provide more advance notice of the action," Wyndham told state and local authorities in the letter. They blamed "the speed and vast reach of the physical calamity that is the coronavirus outbreak, as well as the different and new declaration of a state of emergency and directives at the federal, state and local level."
   
 Branson's Board of Aldermen passed a public masking ordinance July 28, which went into effect Friday. Missouri does not have a statewide masking mandate.
   
 Missouri's unemployment rate was 10.1 percent in May, the most recent month for which the state labor department had statistics. That figure is roughly on par with the worst unemployment rates during the Great Recession of 2007-2009.
   
 The most recent joblessness numbers in the Branson area were more grim than those for Missouri as a whole: 14.6 percent of Taney County workers were deemed unemployed in June, nearly double the Springfield area's unemployment rate of 7.5 percent.
   
 Missouri saw 14,804 new unemployment claims the week ending July 25, as the $600 weekly unemployment benefit for jobless workers under the CARES Act began to expire.
   
 More than 824 new Taney County unemployment claims were filed in June, the most recent month for which county-level Missouri data are available.

We all have habits that “feel right” because they have become custom to us, but when we examine those habits, we may find that they just don’t provide the value they once did. People tend to overcomplicate things for themselves and the people around them. Some people create unnecessary complexity while others just want to simplify things. For example, one of the biggest complications in business is when people don’t communicate with each other properly or to the level of detail necessary. While relationships and partnerships aren’t normally accomplished overnight or as an afterthought, the hard work that results in building productive relationships isn’t difficult to understand. In fact, if you have a successful relationship or two in your personal life you already know the process.

When you think about the big picture of almost everyone’s love and affection for food, you then have to weigh in on whether or not what you’re eating is good for you. It may look good, it may taste good, but consider this – is it wholesome and nutritious, and does it benefit your well-being? For example, an occasional cocktail can’t hurt anyone, but if mixed with a power drink, you could be driving your internal self mad. A good alternative is blood orange juice (if you can get it) or just plain old seltzer on the rocks with your favorite alcohol. Personally, I’ve been having a battle I’m winning with all kinds of alcohol, in that I’m only having a few drinks a week, whereby it used to be a few drinks a night. Consequently, I’ve cut my alcohol intake down by 30%. Being aware of what you’re consuming on every level is most important to your happiness and well-being. For example, if you eat a lot of salt, you could be provoking inflammation. That inflammation affects your muscles and prevents you from relaxing.

I had taken some time to stay on a nature preserve so that I could connect with the wildlife in their own habitat. As I was waiting for the ferry to leave my week on the reserve, I suddenly needed to lotion my ashy legs. One of the legs of my suitcase was broken in transport, so I asked my companion to hold up my bag while I lotion my legs. Halfway through the application my companion asked me if I was done. I responded loudly and with great irritation, “No, I have TWO legs!” Did I mention there was a man standing across from us who only had ONE leg? Yeah. I picked it up in my peripheral vision and managed to still make that insanely insensitive comment like a full on idiot. Needless to say, it was a LONG ferry ride back to the main island.

Ansell struck out five straight in the second and third innings. But Laurel Auto’s offense came to life in the fourth, sending eight men to the plate and scoring four runs.


  “The four-run inning in the fourth, the walks hurt us,” Pfeil said. “He jammed a guy and he was able to squeak a ground ball past our first baseman that led to a big inning.”


  Chris Miller led off with a double down the line in left field. With two outs, three straight batters walked to force in a run. The No. 8 hitter in the lineup, Austin Price, doubled down the line in right field on a 3-2 count. With the runners in motion, all three crossed the plate to give Laurel Auto a 4-2 advantage.


  Troy Emert had an infield single, moved up on a ground out and scored on pinch-hitter Jake Felton’s two-out single to left field, pulling Martella’s within 4-3 in the eighth.


  “Jake Felton has battled through an arm injury this year but we do not hesitate to bring him in to hit,” Pfeil said. “He’s had great at-bats this entire season. We were fully confident he was going to create something there.”


  Laurel Auto was one out away from clinching in the bottom of the ninth, but Grant Norris drew a walk and Zach Mancz doubled off the wall in left field, plating Norris with the game-tying run.


  In the top of the 10th, Chris Miller was hit by a pitch, took off for second and moved to third when a throw went into center field as Dallas Hite drew a walk. Cleanup hitter Swank hit a grounder to second baseman Ansell and Martella’s recorded the out at second. But Swank beat Grant Norris’ throw to first, avoiding an inning-ending double play while also driving in the go- ahead run.


  “We had the momentum there. It looks like we get a double play. We don’t get it,” Pfeil said. “Where we were at in our order, we were asking some guys with minimal at-bats to do something. LAG doesn’t make a lot of mistakes. They’re a tough team.”


  Laurel Auto reliever Nick Lagnese went five innings with four strikeouts and one walk. He worked out of a second-and-third jam when he entered the game with no outs in the fifth.


  Sam Newcomer closed the game with a perfect 10th inning, including a strikeout and two grounders to shortstop Tyler Suder, the last one setting off a celebration on the field.


  “Me and Lags (Lagnese) have been here four years,” Swank said. “This is the first time we’ve won a playoff game (this year). To actually win against a team that has so much talent, everybody knows they’re way more talented than us. But to pull it off is just special.”


  Ansell struck out seven batters and Devin Foster fanned nine in 51/3 innings of relief.


  “We just know we might not have as much talent as them or PC, but we just come together and have heart and see where that takes us,” Swank said.


  Pfeil had no doubts about Swank’s talent level. As the Laurel Auto player walked off the field, Pfeil called to him and put his arms around the player’s shoulders.


  “Nobody better deserves this than you,” Pfeil said, hugging Swank. “I’m so happy for you.”

“That’s all that matters. All I care about is we won.”


  Laurel Auto Group advanced to the league final series for the first time since 2015. That season LAG beat Paul’s Renegades in the semifinals and lost to Martella’s in the final. In 2014, Laurel Auto lost to Martella’s in the championship round of the playoffs.


  This year, Laurel Auto snapped Martella’s run of 11 consecutive berths in the league title series.


  “It is tough to take not winning it this year,” Martella’s manager Kerry Pfeil said. “We believe that (advancing to the final series) is part of the tradition here. However, we’ve said it all summer, with the COVID-19 pandemic, we’re blessed to be out here developing relationships.


  “The hardest thing about your last game, win or lose, is you’re saying good- bye to young men,” Pfeil added. “We were very blessed and I’d like to thank (JCBL Commissioner) Donnie Stanton, the city, my guys and the other teams. We were lucky. We came out of this with zero cases of COVID. What we were doing here worked and we’re prepping young men for their college seasons – hopefully.”


  The series went back-and-forth, with Martella’s posting a 12-2 mercy-rule victory in Game 1. Laurel Auto bounced back with a 4-3 win in the second game.


  Martella’s used a late two-run homer and a two-run double to win Game 3 by a 6-5 score. Then Laurel plated 11 runs over the final two innings in a wild 15-8 win in which each team had 15 hits.


  “People have talked to me and said, ‘Your team has so much fun and so much heart. They never quit,’ ” Laurel Auto manager Jim Skiles said. “The last two nights, you just looked in their eyes and knew they were going to compete no matter what.


  “We said that if we played smart, played small ball, we could compete with anybody,” Skiles added. “We have good team speed. We’re deep in pitching. They’re hot right now. We just peaked at the right time.”


  In the decisive fifth game, Martella’s Pharmacy outhit Laurel Auto Group 11-4. Each team’s pitchers had solid stretches on the mound and a few lapses that led to runs.


  Martella’s Pharmacy started the game with an offensive barrage that included four straight hits, including Adam Cecere’s two-run homer onto the concourse near the right field stands. Brenden Lavely recovered to limit the damage to a 2-0 deficit.


  “That was what we had set up,” Skiles said. “Lavely got roughed up the first night and he wanted some revenge. He was well rested and we gave him the start.”


  Martella’s starter Jake Ansell was sharp early. He retired eight of the first nine batters he faced, with the lone runner reaching on an error.

Laurel Auto Group needed two straight dramatic victories, including 10 innings on Tuesday, to earn the franchise’s first trip to the league championship series in five years.


  Veteran Jake Swank beat out a throw to first base in a close call to avoid a potential inning-ending double play at Sargent’s Stadium at the Point. The go- ahead run scored on the play and Laurel Auto closer Sam Newcomer retired Martella’s Pharmacy in order in the bottom of the inning as LAG won 5-4 in Game 5 of the Johnstown Collegiate Baseball League semifinal series.


  “I really struggled all week and everyone picked me up,” said Swank, who had been a AAABA Tournament pick-up player for Martella’s Pharmacy the previous two years. “I thought, ‘All I wanted to do was put the ball in play.’ I didn’t exactly do what I wanted. But I did the job.

I’ve been in the business and the flatshare industry for many years and one of the most important things I’ve learned is that we need complications. Do you know what complications bring you? They bring you more business. They are what push you forward, make you adapt to unexpected situations and keep you on your toes. You meet new people that you never knew you needed, the right people to collaborate with, to partner up with. These people see that you are working so hard, that you are miles ahead of the rest, quick on your toes, determined, pushing your own limits, using your time productively, effectively and efficiently and not wasting their time. By trial and error, you learn along the way. A lot of my successful business deals came from complications because they bring you more work which makes you active in different fields, makes you go places, meet people and do new things to make you advance, gain knowledge and experience. That’s how you do business, that’s how you make money. If you want a life without complications, then don’t start a business.


--DocBreak--
We all make plans about the things we want to achieve and succeed at, be it business related or personal. We take the time, create strategies and consult with others, however things rarely go as smoothly as you wished. Complications happen all the time especially when it comes to business, they are unexpected and can impact you and your business in different ways. There’s nothing you can do to avoid them so that’s why you should expect them to happen and be prepared for anything that might come your way. Everyone thinks of complications as something negative, something that can destroy everything you’ve worked for and that in turn creates fear. In business, there’s no room for second-guessing because that’s when everything will start to fall apart (and you start to lose money).
