The 49ers will probably look to focus on the run, despite their limited success last week. The Packers didn't have an answer for Dalvin Cook in Week 8. The Vikings running back picked up 226 yards from scrimmage and found the end zone four times. Maybe they'll have better luck against a 49ers run game that's struggled at times this season.

The Packers have a few issues heading into this week's matchup with the 49ers. For starters, the game is scheduled for Thursday night, which gives both teams a short week. Also, multiple players will miss the game for reasons related to COVID, including running backs Jamaal Williams and A.J. Dillon. Starter Aaron Jones is already nursing a calf injury that has him questionable should the game be played on Thursday.

Teams with offensive line issues tend to focus on the run. But the Bears have been among the NFL's worst rushing teams this season, averaging only 85.6 yards per game. "They haven't been able to run the ball, even when their O-line is healthy," Zahn notes. "Their offense hasn't been very good, even when their O-line is healthy. The Titans don't have a great defense themselves. But, for the Bears, I think this is going to be a challenging week for them to get anything done offensively. It's going to be on the Bears defense to try to do something."
