India's Global Real Estate Transparency Index ranking has improved by one notch to 34 on the back of regulatory reforms, better market data and green initiatives, according to property consultant JLL. India was ranked 35th in the index during 2018 bi-annual survey, while the country was at 36th position in 2016 and 39th in 2014. The country's real estate market is currently placed in the 'semi-transparent' zone. The United Kingdom (UK) ranks first in the list of 99 countries, followed by the United States, Australia, France, Canada, New Zealand, the Netherlands, Ireland, Sweden and Germany. Mainland China is at 32nd position, Chinese Taipei at 23rd, Sri Lanka is at 65th position while Pakistan is at 73rd. Top 10 countries are categorised as highly transparent, while those in the 11th position to 33rd are termed as transparent. "The country ranks 34th globally on the index, with higher levels of transparency observed in India due to regulatory reforms, enhanced market data and sustainability initiatives," JLL India said in a statement. This improvement is led by the progress in the country's REIT (Real Estate Investment Trust) framework attracting greater interest from institutional investors. The structural reforms such as the Real Estate Regulation and Development Act 2016 (RERA), GST, Benami Transaction Prohibition (Amendment) Act, 2016, Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code and digitisation of land records have brought about greater transparency in what was an erstwhile largely unregulated sector a few years back, JLL said. This is the 11th edition of the Global Real Estate Transparency Index. It covers 99 countries and territories and 163 city regions. This latest survey has been extended to quantify 210 separate elements of transparency, with additional coverage on sustainability and resilience, health and wellness, proptech and alternatives sectors.

Patiala With demand for water peaking in paddy sowing season, groundwater levels in Punjab are showing signs of depletion even as no progress is being reported in sustainable water management schemes because the Centre and states have not released funds.No district is adopting water conservation measures as part of Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY), Rural Infrastructure Development Funds ( RIDF-20) and Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY).Sources who wish to remain anonymous say neither the state nor the Centre have released funds under any soil and water conservation scheme this year. Therefore, districts which are receiving applications from farmers and others to adopt water saving measures cannot keep up with the demand.To popularise such schemes the government had announced subsidies on tools to save water such as rain gun, systems for drip irrigation, sprinkler irrigation, micro sprinkler, mini sprinkler and water pipeline.According to the department, soil and water conservation, Punjab, the centre has 60 share in PMKSY and RKVY while RIDF-20 is sponsored by the state government under a National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development project.An official of the agriculture department said paddy was considered to be the most water consuming crop but the districts were struggling to provide benefit to farmers.Pleading anonymity, he said, "The Centre and state governments already had low budgets for implementation of the conservation schemes. For example, last year a district demanded Rs 1 crore after taking into account farmers' demands, but it was sanctioned Rs 20 lakh. However this year, no district has received any funds."Dharminder Sharma, chief conservator, soils, Punjab, said, "No scheme has been scrapped. Funds have just been deferred because of the Covid-19 situation. It's just a delay,"Kahan Singh Pannu, secretary, agriculture department, said, "I am not aware of it. I will speak to officials concerned."

NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) — Cyprus and its European Union partners are working to rein in Turkey’s “expansionist policy” in the eastern Mediterranean amid heightened tensions over an offshore search for hydrocarbons, the island nation's president said Tuesday. President Nicos Anastasiades said that the 27-member bloc needs to take stock of how much leeway it will give an “insolent” Turkey that wants to control the region. Anastasiades’ remarks came a day after Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said his country would “reciprocate” if the EU takes measures censuring Turkey for carrying out a gas search in waters where Cyprus has exclusive economic rights. “Unfortunately, we're talking about an agitator that's seeking to dominate the entire eastern Mediterranean and place under its control a number of countries that ring the eastern Mediterranean,\" Anastasiades said. “This is incomprehensible and unacceptable not only on the basis of international justice, but also based on customary friendly relations that neighboring countries should hold.\" Turkey doesn’t recognize Cyprus as a state and has dispatched warship-escorted ships to drill for gas in Cyprus' exclusive economic zone, including in areas where the Cypriot government has licensed international energy companies like French Total and Italy's Eni to drill. Turkey claims almost half of Cyprus' economic zone and insists it's acting to protect its interests and those of breakaway Turkish Cypriots to the area's energy reserves. Cyprus was ethnically split in 1974 when Turkey invaded following a coup by supporters of union with Greece. Only Turkey recognizes a Turkish Cypriot declaration of independence. Cyprus joined the EU in 2004, but only the internationally recognized south enjoys full...

Shelter in place. Lockdown. Quarantine. Whatever you call it, it’s been a few months since the COVID-19 pandemic taught us what staying home for an extended period of time actually looks and feels like. These are unprecedented times. And although things are unpredictable right now, we can control our ability to emerge from this challenge differently than we entered it. “Like everything in life, every challenge and every hardship is a lesson to be learned,” says Eric Simonson, certified financial planner and owner of Abundo Wealth based in Minneapolis. Some of these takeaways are spiritual, emotional, mental or physical. And some are financial. Here are three pieces of money advice you can apply to your bank account, budget and lifestyle as life evolves after lockdown. INSULATE AGAINST AN EMERGENCY Financial experts believe this pandemic has illuminated the pressing need for emergency funds and cash reserves. “Financial advisors for years, I think, with a lot of people, could talk until they’re blue in the face about why an emergency fund is a good idea,” says Kevin Mahoney, CFP, founder of Illumint, a virtual financial firm based in Washington, D.C. “But for people who were fortunate to have not actually experienced an unexpected medical event, a long-term job loss, whatever it might be, it can be hard to really convince people that this is a top priority for their money.” Now, job losses, furloughs and medical emergencies have provided a tangible example of why these funds are so important. The general rule of thumb for an emergency fund is to have three to six months’ worth of living expenses saved. That may or may not be enough, depending on the circumstances. If you’re able, save something now. Even $500 is a good start. PREPARE (DON’T...

Milano, 7 lug. (Adnkronos) - Un intervento legato a Industria 4.0 sarebbe auspicabile e "per noi è sempre stato un programma di successo, non abbiamo mai capito perché fosse stato smontato". E' quanto afferma il presidente di Assolombarda, Alessandro Spada, durante un webinar, a proposito delle parole del ministro Stefano Patuanelli, che ha annunciato l'intenzione di rafforzare il pacchetto industria 4.0. "Tutto ciò che può rendere questa misura strutturale sicuramente sarebbe già un passo in avanti rispetto a quello che abbiamo visto negli ultimi anni". Non c'è al momento una 'questione settentrionale', ma, sottolinea Spada, "la pandemia ha colpito forte in quest'area, c'è la necessità di avere misure efficaci e concrete. Abbiamo assistito a troppi annunci, troppe cose dette in grande velocità a cui non sono seguiti provvedimenti concreti. Non c'è una contrapposizione con un'altra parte del Paese, ma - precisa - abbiamo la responsabilità di essere la parte produttiva più importante, che deve trascinare il resto" dell'Italia.

The world as we know it has been completely changed by the COVID-19 pandemic. The year 2020 will go down in history as a watershed moment --everything that happened before 2020 will be remembered as BCE (before COVID-19 era) and we now live in the CE (COVID-19 era).Gone are the days when one trained for a job for 3-4 years and spent the rest of their life making a career in it. We live in an age where the average life expectancies have increased tremendously and people will continue to work for at least 60-80 years till they retire. This has given rise to the concept of the 60-year curriculum, an initiative at Harvard University which focuses on the different careers that each of us will have over our lifetimes.According to Dr Chris Dede, Professor in Learning Technologies at Harvard Graduate School of Education and a central player in this initiative, in the future, most adults will have 5-7 careers and some of which don't exist right now. The only way to prepare yourself for the future is to learn how to unlearn and relearn multiple times effectively. Being agile and rapidly able to reinvent yourself will be a prerequisite for a successful career.That is the mindset students must adopt if they want to future-proof their careers. The Fourth Industrial Revolution has ushered in new technological innovations like machine learning and artificial intelligence which have led to a paradigm shift in skills required for work effectively. According to the World Economic Forum Future of Jobs Report 2018, by the year 2020 the top 10 skills that will be most required are all cognitive and social-emotional skills like Critical Thinking, Complex Problem Solving, People Management, Emotional Intelligence, Judgement and Decision Making. It is clear that students will have to commit to learning these foundational skills to survive and succeed in the modern world.Organizations across the globe have also shifted to remote work almost overnight due to the lockdowns imposed by governments across the world to contain the pandemic. Many of us have been working from home over three months now. While only time will tell if these changes will last, we can be certain that the world of work may not ever go back to what it was previously.This means students of today who will be professional tomorrow have to learn new ways of working -- managing virtual teams and leading businesses remotely.As people figure out the rituals that help them stay focused and productive while they work from home, everyone will have to build skills to work well with and get the best out of their teams --being empathetic to your teammates domestic issues, compassionate when dealing with interruptions by children, pets or parents, and listening actively when concerns are being shared.In these uncertain times, embracing change and building resilience have become paramount. All of us are going to face several challenges, personally and professionally -- pay cuts, furloughs, job losses, etc. The only way to deal with them is to learn to accept them, look at them as problems that need to be solved creatively, and look for ways to move forward.The future of work is here. To survive and succeed in this new normal, students will have to master cognitive-social-emotional skills -- the ability to think critically, communicate effectively, collaborate well and be creative. They will also need to embrace uncertainty and navigate change deftly. Last but not least, everyone will have to master the art of learning, unlearning and relearning regularly.No matter what you do and where you work, these skills will matter. Set yourself on a path to success by building these foundational skills!(Author Sanjay Deshpande is a Senior Curriculum Specialist at Harappa Education. Views expressed here are personal.)

Rising for the fifth straight session, the benchmark Sensex added another 187 points on Tuesday, with gains in financial counters offsetting losses in power and infra stocks. After a volatile trading session, the 30-share BSE index ended 187.24 points, or 0.51 per cent, higher at 36,674.52. The NSE Nifty was up 36 points, or 0.33 per cent, at 10,799.65. On the Sensex chart, Bajaj Finance was the top gainer, rallying around 8 per cent, followed by IndusInd Bank, Bajaj Finserv, Infosys, ICICI Bank, Axis Bank and HCL Tech. On the other hand, NTPC, ITC, PowerGrid and Tata Steel were among the laggards. According to traders, domestic investors shrugged off weak cues from global markets and focussed on positive factors like sustained foreign fund inflows and hopes of a good monsoon. Foreign institutional investors were net buyers in the capital market on Monday, purchasing equities worth Rs 348.35 crore, provisional exchange data showed. Gains in the market were, however, capped as rising Covid-19 cases weighed on investor sentiment. The number of cases around the world linked to the disease has crossed 1.16 crore and the death toll has topped 5.38 lakh. In India, the number of infections spiked to 7,19,665 and the death toll rose to 20,160. Bourses in Shanghai ended with marginal gains, while those in Hong Kong, Tokyo and Seoul closed in the red. Stock exchanges in Europe were also trading on a negative note in early deals. Meanwhile, international oil benchmark Brent crude futures fell 1.02 per cent to USD 42.66 per barrel. On the currency front, the rupee extended the losses and settled 25 paise lower at 74.93 against the US dollar.

Uttar Pradesh police on Tuesday said 40 police teams and a special task force was hunting for dreaded gangster Vikas Dubey, on the run after ambushing eight policemen with the help of his accomplices in Kanpur city last Thursday night. The state police chief added that the force will not rest until Dubey is nabbed.The sensational and barbaric execution of policemen last Thursday night is also in focus for exposing moles in the state police force who actively tipped off Dubey hours before the police raid and led their own colleagues into a deadly trap laid by the gangster. A stunned UP police force is now in hot pursuit of the gangster who managed to flee with his accomplices the same night."40 teams and STF are working. We're collecting information on Vikas Dubey's accomplices and members of his family. Until and unless we arrest Vikas Dubey and his accomplices, we will not sit quietly," UP's ADG (law and order) Prashant Kumar was quoted as saying on Tuesday by news agency ANI.Two sub-inspectors and a constable were suspended yesterday over suspicion that they might have leaked information to Dubey. Another sub- inspector was suspended earlier for his alleged links with Dubey. The police chief cited the huge cache of arms and explosives found at Dubey's house which was razed down by police later to question if there was a deeper link to this incident.3 more cops suspended on suspicion of links to Vikas Dubey"The entire house was searched and 2 kg of explosive substance, 6 country-made pistols, 15 crude bombs and 25 cartridges were recovered," Kumar said before adding, "Where did they get such a huge cache of weapons? What weapons were used? Information was received that someone kept it hidden at his home."Police had also stumbled upon a concrete bunker built inside Dubey's house that was stocked with provisions to last for months apart from the seized weapons and explosives, hidden carefully inside the walls.25 cops, all eyewitnesses to 2001 murder, turned hostile during Dubey's triaState-wide raids to track down Dubey, who faces 60 criminal cases, are continuing. An alert has been sounded in all 75 districts of the state and 25 teams from 40 police stations are involved in search operations. UP borders have been sealed and posters put up at toll plazas in the state amidst apprehensions that he might have already crossed the border. The bounty on his head was increased to Rs 2.5 lakh from Rs 1 lakh.Officials believe that Dubey had supporters in the police force who helped him and his gang have a free run. This suspicion was corroborated when Daya Shankar Agnihotri, an aide of Dubey arrested on Sunday, claimed in a video statement that Dubey had been alerted about the raid by a caller from a police station. It is suspected that the police station in question could be the one in Chaubeypur, about 14km from Bikru village where Dubey lived. Vinay Tiwari, the Chaubeypur station officer was the first person to be suspended in the case. There are allegations that he has been protecting Dubey. "It is viral in the media that Circle Officer Devendra Mishra, who lost his life in Kanpur encounter, had written a letter. DGP has sent an IG level officer to investigate this. The truth will come out in the investigation," Prashant Kumar said., referring to reports that Bilhaur circle officer Mishra, who led the raid team to Dubey's village, had told former Kanpur senior superintendent of police about Tiwari protecting Dubey.
