INDIANAPOLIS - Canadian auto racer James Hinchcliffe is expected to compete in at least two IndyCar races this season after landing a sponsor on Thursday.
 Genesys, an American-based technology company, says it will sponsor Hinchcliffe for the Indianapolis Motor Speedway road-course race on May 9 and the Indianapolis 500 on May 24.
 The company says details on Hinchcliffe's team will be in announced in the coming weeks.
 Hinchcliffe, from Oakville, Ont., lost his seat with Arrow McLaren SP Racing after the 2019 season.
 McLaren came on board with Sam Schmidt and Ric Peterson's team following the season and opted to make a lineup change. Pato O'Ward and reigning Indy Lights champion Oliver Askew will drive for the team.
 The 33-year-old Hinchcliffe, one of the most popular IndyCar racers last decade, has been a full-timer in the series since 2011. He has won six races.

 “Going public, yeah.

But to go public, yeah, it didn’t sit well with me,” Mendoza said on the broadcast. “Honestly, it made me sad for the sport that that’s how this all got found out.
 “This wasn’t something MLB naturally investigated or that even other teams complained about because they naturally heard about it and investigations happened,” she added. “But it came from within.

It’s something that you don’t do. I totally get telling your future teammates, helping them win, letting people know, but to go public with it and call them out and start all of this, it’s hard to swallow.”
 Fiers went public in a report last November by The Athletic. That prompted baseball’s investigation, leading to one-season suspensions for Astros general manager Jeff Luhnow and manager AJ Hinch, who were fired Monday. Boston manager Alex Cora and Mets manager Carlos Beltrán also lost their jobs — Cora was Houston’s bench coach in 2017 and Beltrán a player. MLB’s investigation implicated both.

Canada's foreign minister on Thursday vowed to push Iran for answers about the mistaken downing of a passenger plane amid high tensions after the US killed one of Tehran's top commanders.The plane was hit and all 176 people on board were killed just hours after Iran fired strikes against US troops stationed in Iraq in retaliation for a drone attack that killed its most prominent general, Qasem Soleimani."In the wake of such a horrific tragedy there are many questions," Francois-Philippe Champagne said at a meeting in London."Families want answers, the international community wants answers, the world is waiting for answers and we will not rest until we get them."Champagne was speaking after talks with counterparts from countries whose nationals were among those killed when the plane was hit after taking off from Tehran last week.Fifty-seven of the victims on board the Kiev-bound Ukraine International Airlines flight were Canadian.Iran's initial denial of claims, based on US intelligence, that the Boeing 737 was hit by a missile sparked days of protests and international calls for a full and transparent investigation.But the Islamic republic later accepted the jet had been targeted "unintentionally". President Hassan Rouhani called it an "unforgivable mistake".In a joint statement after Thursday's talks, Canada, Ukraine, Sweden, Afghanistan and Britain issued a five-point plan for cooperation with Iran.It called for "full and unhindered access" for foreign officials to and within Iran and "a thorough, independent and transparent international investigation".Iran should "assume full responsibility for the downing of flight PS752 and (recognise) its duties towards the families of the victims and other parties -- including compensation".In addition, it called for those responsible to be held to account in an independent criminal investigation and trial in line with international standards of due process and human rights.'Grief and anger'Champagne told a news conference that families of those who died needed closure and there was a need to prevent similar incidents in the future."When you accept full responsibility there are consequences coming from that," he said."Today is not the day for blame, today is the day for answers," he added, saying the families had "grief and anger and they want us to stand for them".The ministers earlier took part in a candle lighting ceremony and a moment's silence at Canada House in London in memory of the victims.The United States said on Tuesday that it supported the three EU countries that launched a process charging Iran with failing to observe the terms of the 2015 deal curtailing its nuclear programme.Britain, France and Germany began the dispute process in the wake of Soleimani's death.German's defence minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer on Thursday confirmed reports that US President Donald Trump threatened the EU3 with a 25-percent tariff on car exports if it continued to back the deal.British minister Andrew Murrison said the government wanted to keep the deal alive, assessing it was the "best hope" of preventing Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon.President Rouhani said earlier on Thursday that his country's "daily enrichment" of uranium was currently "higher" than before the conclusion of the 2015 nuclear deal.He did not specify whether Iran was now producing a greater quantity of enriched uranium, or whether it was enriching ore with uranium 235 isotopes at a higher level than before the deal.

 In addition to rave reviews the series garnered a number of accolades, including a spot on the American Film Institute's list of the top TV programs of 2019.
 HBO estimated that episodes were watched by more than 7 million viewers on average across its various linear and digital platforms. Those aren't blockbuster numbers by the pay channel's standards, but they are the highest for a first-year HBO drama, per Vulture, since "Big Little Lies" in 2017.

 If the Great American Conference men's basketball season ended today, five Oklahoma schools could be traveling to Bartlesville for the conference's postseason championship tourney, set for the first weekend in March.
 Eight games deep into the conference schedule, East Central, Southeastern Oklahoma State and Henderson State are tied for first place at 6-2.
 Arkansas-Monticello, Oklahoma Baptist and Southern Nazarene are tied for fourth at 5-3.
 Arkansas Tech stands alone in seventh place at 4-4.
 Knotted for the No. 8 spot -- which will be the final berth in the tourney -- are Southwestern Oklahoma State and Ouachita Baptist at 3-5.
 Rounding out the standings are Northwestern Oklahoma State and Southern Arkansas at 2-6, and Harding at 1-7.
 In other words -- with 14 conference dates remaining -- all 12 teams are still in contention for the eight coveted tourney spots.
 One of the direct connections with Bartlesville is the Arkansas-Monticello team, which is coached by Kyle Tolin, whose dad Doug is a local native and a member of the Bartlesville Athletic Hall of Fame. Doug also has been an assistant in past seasons for Kyle.
 This is slated as the final year Bartlesville -- specifically the Bartlesville Sports Commission (BSC) -- will host the GAC tourney.
 The GAC list consists of six NCAA-II schools from Oklahoma and six from Arkansas.
 The Bartlesville Bruin Fieldhouse has been the only venue for the GAC basketball title tourney since the conference began competitive play in the 2011-12 school year.
 As of next year, the GAC tourney is scheduled to move to a Tulsa site.
 Actually, Bartlesville's time as host site was supposed to have ended in 2019. But, when the GAC found itself without a place to hold its 2020 tourney, the BSC stepped to the plate as a pinch-hitter.
 The tourney schedule will be an eight-team, single-elimination format. The winner will automatically advance to the NCAA-II regionals.
 Women's basketball
 On the women's side, three Oklahoma institutions top the current standings -- Southeastern Oklahoma State (7-1), Southwestern Oklahoma State (6-2) and Southern Nazarene (6-2).
 Tied at 5-3 for fourth place are Arkansas-Monticello, Henderson State and Arkansas Tech.
 Three other schools are knotted for seventh place, at 4-4 -- Southern Arkansas, Northwestern Oklahoma State and Harding.
 Rounding out the conference standings are Ouachita Baptist (1-7), East Central (1-7) and Oklahoma Baptist (0-8).
 Like the men, the ladies still have 14 conference games remaining.
 The tourney format at Bartlesville for the women will be the same as for the men, with the ladies' winning advancing to the NCAA-II women's regionals.
 Last year, Southwestern Oklahoma State won the GAC women's crown and powered all the way to the NCAA-II national championship game prior to losing.
 A member of that Southwestern Oklahoma team was Bartlesville High graduate Hailey Tucker, who has now graduated.

 OK ... OK... let's ... dear God ... let's talk about what's happening with us and Iran.   The first thing we have to remember is that our government lies to us about wars. This is a matter of record: we invaded Iraq and toppled Saddam Hussein because our government swore it had strong intelligence that he was hoarding weapons of mass destruction. It turns out that he was not, and that most of that intelligence was manufactured or willfully obtuse. And our world is more dangerous, not less, because of those lies.   We invaded Afghanistan for legitimate reasons, but recently released documents show that the government under three presidents -- Bush, Obama and Trump -- has systematically lied to the American people about how the war was going and about the chances of success.   Our government lies to us about wars. We must keep that foremost in our minds as we think about what is happening with Iran.   The idea that Suleimani was actively planning an imminent attack on Americans does not appear to be based on any facts. No evidence of this has been presented. Vice President Mike Pence, in an attempt to justify our killing Suleimani, even went so far as to suggest that he had been involved in the Sept. 11 attacks. That reeks of desperation -- first of all, Sept. 11 isn't an imminent attack, it happened 19 years ago; secondly, if there had been any evidence of Iranian involvement, the Bush administration would have pounced on it; thirdly, Sept. 11 was almost entirely pulled off by Saudi nationals and we're selling them weapons.   Even if Suleimani were planning an imminent attack on Americans, the idea that killing him would scuttle the operation is absurd. Suleimani wasn't a lone wolf terrorist or the charismatic leader of a small band of fanatics; he was a member of a military with a chain of command. Military forces don't stop operations just because a general is gone. Suleimani's subordinates would continue the plan. Of course they would -- that's how militaries work. I mean, we didn't stop the war in Afghanistan when Gen. Petraeus was replaced, did we?   All of which means that it is extremely unlikely that Suleimani was killed because he represented an imminent threat to American lives. However, by killing him -- and effectively declaring war on Iran -- Trump has created a situation in which American lives are very much at risk across the world. Even at home, if Iranian cyber attacks can reach our infrastructure in places like power plants, dams or hospitals.   We have no idea what Iran is going to do -- and Trump has created the very situation that he ostensibly was trying to prevent.   This is a thing he does a lot. It's practically his signature move.   He started a trade war with China to help boost our economy -- and instead ended up hurting almost every sector of our economy, for concessions that may or may not really happen and may or may not be meaningful. A conflict that he swore would be \"cheap and easy to win\" hurt American business across the board.   This is particularly true in manufacturing, which Trump vowed to save and pursued aggressive policies to prop up, particularly of deregulation. Instead, American factory activity went down for the fifth consecutive month in December and the Institute of Supply Management's manufacturing purchasing managers' index hit its lowest level since June 2009. America's manufacturing under Trump isn't rebounding -- it's shrinking, despite his overt attempts to help it.   Whatever Trump touches turns to swamp. And now he is going around Congress' back to start a war with a country that is three times the size of Iraq, has terrorist cells around the world and a demonstrated cyber warfare capability. Before he started, we had international inspectors in Iran confirming that it was not advancing its nuclear program. Now, Iran has declared it's resuming that program.   Before Trump started, we could count on our NATO allies and our partners around the world. Now, we stand alone, loathed by our former allies. Right now much of the world looks at us and looks at Iran, and has a hard time deciding who the good guys are.   Trump's actions have put us at much greater risk, not less, and it looks like he is hell-bent on pushing us further in. And what did we get out of this? How did it benefit the United States?   It doesn't. President Trump doesn't do anything because it benefits the United States. He takes our trade policy and uses it to hurt the American economy; he pushes manufacturing and causes it to shrink. He uses our military, the greatest on earth, to make us less safe.   And the more he pushes, the less safe we are likely to be. All we can be sure of is that he'll lie about it. Our world is more dangerous because of his actions.

Late last year, Edward-Elmhurst started using SwipeSense. About 4,000 employees at Edward and Elmhurst Hospitals are wearing badges that wirelessly communicate with the software to record all hand hygiene events.
 The system captures data confirming that clinicians and other employees are washing their hands when they should, and a software platform lets managers know who is washing and who is not complying with the mandate.
 Data sent to the SwipeSense platform enables managers to view compliance at the facility, department, unit, room and employee levels to an online dashboard.
 Employees have a unique badge identification, and a green light flashes to indicate that data from the badge has been transmitted. Only hygiene opportunities and events associated with patient room visits are recorded.
 “As we continue our journey toward safety and high reliability, preventing hospital-acquired infections is a major focus,” says Mary Lou Mastro, System CEO at Edward-Elmhurst. “SwipeSense will help us increase hand-hygiene compliance, aid in the fight against infection and improve our overall patient experience.”

That reeks of desperation -- first of all, Sept. 11 isn't an imminent attack, it happened 19 years ago; secondly, if there had been any evidence of Iranian involvement, the Bush administration would have pounced on it; thirdly, Sept. 11 was almost entirely pulled off by Saudi nationals and we're selling them weapons.   Even if Suleimani were planning an imminent attack on Americans, the idea that killing him would scuttle the operation is absurd. Suleimani wasn't a lone wolf terrorist or the charismatic leader of a small band of fanatics; he was a member of a military with a chain of command. Military forces don't stop operations just because a general is gone. Suleimani's subordinates would continue the plan. Of course they would -- that's how militaries work. I mean, we didn't stop the war in Afghanistan when Gen. Petraeus was replaced, did we?   All of which means that it is extremely unlikely that Suleimani was killed because he represented an imminent threat to American lives. However, by killing him -- and effectively declaring war on Iran -- Trump has created a situation in which American lives are very much at risk across the world. Even at home, if Iranian cyber attacks can reach our infrastructure in places like power plants, dams or hospitals.   We have no idea what Iran is going to do -- and Trump has created the very situation that he ostensibly was trying to prevent.   This is a thing he does a lot. It's practically his signature move.   He started a trade war with China to help boost our economy -- and instead ended up hurting almost every sector of our economy, for concessions that may or may not really happen and may or may not be meaningful. A conflict that he swore would be "cheap and easy to win" hurt American business across the board.   This is particularly true in manufacturing, which Trump vowed to save and pursued aggressive policies to prop up, particularly of deregulation. Instead, American factory activity went down for the fifth consecutive month in December and the Institute of Supply Management's manufacturing purchasing managers' index hit its lowest level since June 2009. America's manufacturing under Trump isn't rebounding -- it's shrinking, despite his overt attempts to help it.   Whatever Trump touches turns to swamp. And now he is going around Congress' back to start a war with a country that is three times the size of Iraq, has terrorist cells around the world and a demonstrated cyber warfare capability. Before he started, we had international inspectors in Iran confirming that it was not advancing its nuclear program. Now, Iran has declared it's resuming that program.   Before Trump started, we could count on our NATO allies and our partners around the world. Now, we stand alone, loathed by our former allies. Right now much of the world looks at us and looks at Iran, and has a hard time deciding who the good guys are.   Trump's actions have put us at much greater risk, not less, and it looks like he is hell-bent on pushing us further in. And what did we get out of this? How did it benefit the United States?   It doesn't. President Trump doesn't do anything because it benefits the United States. He takes our trade policy and uses it to hurt the American economy; he pushes manufacturing and causes it to shrink. He uses our military, the greatest on earth, to make us less safe.   And the more he pushes, the less safe we are likely to be. All we can be sure of is that he'll lie about it. Our world is more dangerous because of his actions.

LONDON (AP) -- With Martin Scorsese's "The Irishman" expected to battle "Once Upon a Time in… Hollywood" and "1917" for the best picture Oscar in February, all eyes are on the special effects team that made the sprawling crime epic possible.
 "The Irishman" unfolds over decades, with the 76-year-old Robert De Niro and his co-stars playing their characters from their 30s into retirement age, a feat that's made the film one of 2019's most acclaimed movies.
 It's all possible through new digital de-aging techniques that in the past year in cinemas have shaved decades from Samuel L. Jackson's face and turned back the clock to the 1990s for Will Smith. When Monday's Academy Award nominations are announced, "Captain Marvel" and "Gemini Man" could see their names called along with "The Irishman" in the visual effects category.
 Each film has arrived at its reverse aging trick through a different technique, leading some to call 2019 a monumental year for de-aging in film.
 To many, "The Irishman" stands out from the field, thanks to its complete avoidance of "tracking markers" -- dots painted onto actors faces which allow computers to mathematically replicate facial movements and manipulate them as the director sees fit.
 The youthful transitions of "The Irishman" are the work of Pablo Helman, visual effects supervisor at Industrial Light and Magic, who's an Oscar nominee for his work on "Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones" and "War of the Worlds."
 Helman says the decision to forgo tracking markers came directly from Scorsese and De Niro.
 "He's not going to wear a helmet with little cameras in there," says Helman. "He's going to want to be in the moment with Joe Pesci and Al Pacino on set, with no markers on him. So, if you're going to capture the performance, how are you going to do that?"
 Enter the "three-headed monster," a unique camera rig that has a director camera in the center and two "witness" cameras on either side shooting infrared footage. That allowed Helman to eliminate shadows created by on-set lighting. The shadows could potentially interfere with the geometric facial shapes constructed by de-aging software.
 "You're not interrupting the director's thread of thinking," explains Helman. "You're not changing the light on set, but the computer can see in a different spectrum."
 While the team at Industrial Light and Magic was working on "The Irishman," another group of technical wizards were experimenting with de-aging at Weta Digital (part of director Peter Jackson's Weta Workshop in New Zealand), creating an entirely digital, 23-year-old version of Smith for the action movie "Gemini Man."
 "Since I started visual FX 25 years ago it's been the Holy Grail," says Bill Westenhofer, one of the film's VFX supervisors.
 "You have that many years of expertise of looking at a human face and knowing what's wrong. So, to try and get all the different things together and get it to pull off right, that's been the challenge."
 To create the character of Junior -- a younger clone of Smith's assassin Henry Brogan -- the superstar wore the traditional gray tracksuit, as well as a head rig with two cameras capturing his facial expressions via tracking markers.
 "We decided (on) a ground up approach to build everything from scratch -- from the skull all the way to the skin pores, all the way to the animation and the final kind of oil in the eyes was really the best approach we could take," says Stu Adcock, head of facial motion at Weta.
 Before filming commenced on both "Gemini Man" and "The Irishman," the teams at ILM and Weta drew up test footage to show the films' directors that what they were suggesting was possible.
 For "Gemini Man" it was a clip from the 1995 movie "Bad Boys" into which they inserted two shots of their new, digital Will Smith and asked Ang Lee to spot the "fake."
 For "The Irishman," De Niro also returned to the 1990s, performing the Pink Cadillac scene from "Goodfellas" before being de-aged in post-production -- convincing an initially skeptical Scorsese that he could bring the long- gestating project to life.
 Helman and his team then spent two years looking through old movies and cataloging the targeted ages that De Niro, Pacino and Pesci would appear in "The Irishman." They created a program -- similar to that used to create online "deepfake" videos where one actor's face is swapped for another's -- which would check their work on the movie was heading in the right direction, with the system "spewing out" hundreds of images for cross-referencing.
 Creating Junior required Smith to spend time in a photogrammetry booth where multiple cameras captured his likeness as numerous lights fired in different sequences, giving a base scan of the actor and analyzing the structure of his face from a skin pore level.
 Ironically, considering Scorsese's vocal criticism of Marvel movies as "not cinema," a similar system was used to de-age Jackson in "Captain Marvel." A young Nick Fury was created by comparing footage from old Jackson movies with the work the actor did on set -- again, using tracking markers.
 "I looked at that face as, you know, maybe 'The Negotiator' face," says Jackson, referring to his 1998 movie of the same name, "Fortunately for them and for me, I had enough stuff from that period in my life that they could use a bunch of different facial expressions and films to put that face together that made sense to people who knew me from that time."
 Darren Hendler, director of the Digital Human Group at Digital Domain and the man responsible for turning Josh Brolin into "Avengers" supervillain Thanos, was impressed by Jackson's appearance in the movie.
 "That's more of a 2D-image based approach where they're taking the actor's performance and then they're painting and tracking certain frames. They're still using some of the actor's performance directly, but they're modifying it. It was very believable. It may not have been exactly what the young Samuel Jackson looked like, but it definitely looked de-aged."
 "The de-aging of Samuel L. Jackson is absolutely fantastic," agrees Weta's Guy Williams, adding, "different approaches suit different requirements. It's not a one-size-fits-all kind of situation."
 That's a sentiment echoed by Helman, who believes that 2019 was a watershed year for VFX.
 "It's not by chance that we have several movies that have motion capture performance, facial performance, in three or four different ways. That shows that we're all thinking about digital humans.
 "I mean, we all stand on each other's shoulders," Helman says. "I can't wait for somebody to pick this up and do something else with it, you know?"

SARASOTA, Fla. (WWSB) - The University of South Florida has added a new program that may change the future of health care on the Suncoast.USF’s Sarasota-Manatee campus opened a new health college nursing skills lab this week.In cities like Venice - where this is the only hospital in the area - you’d think there wouldn’t be a shortage in nurses, but it’s a problem that keeps growing.“We’re going to have an even further shortage of nurses coming on because as we all know, we’re opening up new facilities in our community, and that’s going to add to the demand,” Charles Baumann, Suncoast Nursing Action CoalitionTwo state-of-the-art hospitals will be coming to the City of Venice in the next few years. A new and improved Venice Regional Bayfront and Sarasota Memorial Hospital’s first South Sarasota County Campus.“We believe they’re going to need maybe up to 3,000 nurses into the future. That may be five years away, but in a bachelor’s program, it’s a four year program, we need to start doing this now,” Baumann explained. The University of South Florida is doing that. Their accelerated nursing degree program is officially underway at their Sarasota-Manatee campus - offering a path for students to earn a nursing degree through a four-semester program, and is designed for students who already have a bachelor's degree.“We’re giving them a lot of real-world experience here in the lab before we actually send them out to the clinical environment to our surrounding community sites,” Natasha Zurcher, the director of the program, explained.This new program and lab will not only opens the doors for more local students to be licenses, but also to help train nurses more effectively. “You’re reliant on them completely,” Baumann said, “and do you not want them to have the best education possible and make sure that what is needed is done in the efficient matter and going to take care of our needs?”This first semester had 120 applicants, with 30 students selected. The program hopes to admit even more nursing students here within the next few months.“Really at the end of the day, it all boils down to safe patient care. That’s the ultimate goal. Taking care of your family, my family, and really making a positive impact within our local community here,” Zurcher said.“We want to make sure that we are giving them the best foundation possible. USF is stepping to help provide that,” expressed Baumann.An open house will be held in February for new students at the facility on the USF Sarasota-Manatee campus. Copyright 2020 WWSB.

Katie Kearney was nervous. In a few hours, she would be standing before 1,000 people at Brewster Gardens organizing a candlelight vigil for two girls and a woman involved in a terrible car crash. In her mind's eye, Kearney was reliving the horrible events that took her own son's life more than 13 years earlier. She didn't know if she could go through with the vigil that night.
 Suddenly, she got a text on her phone. It was from a friend of her son Sean, who was killed in an ATV accident. The friend wears No. 14 on her sports jersey in honor of Sean, who wore that number while playing hockey. She was letting Kearney know that she would also wear that number for a different friend who was killed in another car crash.
 "That's when I realized, 'I can do this,'" she said. "It was a message from Sean. He was telling me, 'Mom, you've got this.'"
 Kearney pushed through her pain - both emotional and physical, since she also had a broken bone in her foot - to help local residents come together and share their grief during such an emotional moment. Young and old lit candles and let their tears flow during the Jan. 5 vigil. They remembered 13-year-old Claire Zisserson, who was killed Dec. 29 when an alleged drunk driver struck the car she was riding in. Severely injured in that accident were Zisseron's mother Elizabeth and another 13-year-old girl, Kendall Zemotel. Both girls were students at Rising Tide Charter Public School.
 For Kearney, this was an opportunity to pay back all of the kindness and compassion she and her family received when Sean died in 2006. Only 8 at that time, her son was killed when the ATV he was riding on collided with another. The community rallied behind the Kearney family to support them during that tragic time.
 "I was paying it forward," she said. "I knew how therapeutic it was for me when Sean died. Just seeing how supportive people were was very reassuring. I wanted the Zisserson and Zemotel families to feel that too."
 Kearney reached out to town officials, Plymouth schools, local sports teams and others to pull off the vigil. She wanted to use Memorial Hall, but that venue was booked, so she contacted Matt Muratore for help. A neighbor of the Zissersons, the state representative and former Plymouth selectmen secured permits from the town to hold the event at Brewster Gardens.
 "It was very hard on everybody," he said. "Claire is the same age as one of my daughters. They all played sports together. We wanted to do something as a family to help them but didn't know what. When Katie told me what she had in mind, I knew it was a great idea.
 "And who better to do this than Katie? She knew exactly what the family was going through."
 Kearney does know what they experienced. It was a long road of grief and sorrow for her and her family dealing with the loss of a loved one, especially one so young. The Kearneys struggled for some time as they tried to come to terms with a senseless death.
 "The feeling of loss is horrible," she said. "Sean was five days in the hospital before he passed. There is so much sadness. He was so young, and the accident was so preventable."
 Kearney and her husband, Mark, have three sons: Ryan, 24, and Christopher, 18, and Patrick, 15. For them, the grief never ends, though it has lessened somewhat with time.
 What helps with the pain is helping others. Following the death of Sean, Kearney became an advocate for tougher legislation governing ATV activities, including a minimum age for riders and increased penalties for violations. Sean's Law passed in 2010 and is the strictest in the nation.
 Kearney has also gotten involved in numerous programs providing assistance for those in need. She is a member of the Jordan Hospital Club, which raises money for various charities, including hospice. She volunteers with Friends of the Community Ice Skating Rink and also serves with the Plymouth North Boosters Club to benefit high school athletics.
 "I also work with the elderly through home healthcare, and I'm a golf mom," she said.
 By organizing the candlelight vigil, Kearney is continuing that effort to help others and remember Sean at the same time. Pushing through her own pain to connect with people who most need compassion and understanding is how she returns the kindness she experienced during her own time of grief.
 "I didn't want the vigil to be about Sean," she said. "It was for Claire and Kendall. But I did feel like Sean was with me. I believe in signs, and when I got that text, I knew that was his message to me. That was my sign from Sean."

The Senate impeachment trial on whether to remove U.S. President Donald Trump from office formally began on Thursday even as a congressional watchdog found that the White House broke the law by withholding security aid for Ukraine approved by Congress. The assessment from the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office GAO was a setback for Trump, but it was unclear if it would figure in his trial in the Republican-led Senate given that key questions such as whether witnesses will testify or new evidence will be considered remain unanswered.Democrat Adam Schiff, who heads a team of seven House of Representatives members who will serve as prosecutors, appeared on the Senate floor to read the two charges passed by the House on Dec. 18 that accused Trump of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress arising from his dealings with Ukraine. U.S. Chief Justice John Roberts, wearing his black judicial robe, took an oath to preside over the trial and then swore in the assembled senators who will serve as jurors, asking if they would do impartial justice.The 99 senators present signed their assent one by one. One senator - Republican Jim Inhofe - was in his home state of Oklahoma to be with a family member facing a medical issue, according to his office, but was due to sign next week. The Senate is expected to acquit Trump, as none of its 53 Republicans has voiced support for removing him, a step that requires a two-thirds majority. Trump has denied wrongdoing and has called the impeachment process a sham.Opening statements were due to start on Tuesday. The abuse of power cited in the House articles of impeachment included Trumps withholding of 391 million in security aid for Ukraine, a move Democrats have said was aimed at pressuring Kiev into investigating political rival Joe Biden, the presidents possible Democratic opponent in the Nov. 3 election.Congress had approved the funds to help Ukraine combat Russia-backed separatists. The money was ultimately provided in September after the controversy spilled into public view. The GAO said the U.S. Constitution does not grant a president authority to unilaterally withhold funds, as Trump did. Instead, a president can only withhold spending in limited circumstances spelled out by law, its report said.Faithful execution of the law does not permit the President to substitute his own policy priorities for those that Congress has enacted into law, the GAO said on Thursday. The GAOs findings are not legally binding, but its reports are seen by lawmakers as objective, reliable and generally uncontested. It has no prosecutorial power.Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen, who sought the GAO investigation, said the findings undercut Republican arguments that there was nothing wrong with Trumps action. We now have a clear, lucid finding that the Trump administration violated the law and we know that the president ordered the administration to commit an illegal act, he told Reuters.Republican Senator John Cornyn said that while there may have been a civil violation of the law, it was not a criminal matter and certainly not an impeachable act. The Constitution says you impeach presidents for treason, bribery, and high crimes and misdemeanors. And its none of those things, said Cornyn, a former judge.MONITORING AN AMBASSADOR It is only the third impeachment trial in U.S. history and no president has been removed as a direct result of the process. Richard Nixon resigned in 1974 before the full House could vote to impeach him. The House impeached Andrew Johnson in 1868 and Bill Clinton in 1998, but the Senate did not convict them.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the GAO report bolstered Democrats argument that the Senate trial should include new evidence and hear from witnesses. Schiff indicated that the House prosecutors may call Lev Parnas, an associate of Trumps personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, if the Senate permits testimony in the trial.Documents released this week indicated Parnas, a Ukraine-born U.S. citizen, helped Giuliani investigate Biden and his son Hunter, and was also involved in monitoring the movements of former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch before Trump removed her in May. In an interview with Reuters, Giuliani said he pushed Trump to fire Yovanovitch but did not know if Parnas put her under surveillance.Giuliani said he was disappointed with Parnas decision to cooperate with impeachment investigators. I considered him a friend and I considered him to be a man who had character and now I consider him to be a man who will say whatever his phony lawyer wants him to say, Giuliani said.Parnas told MSNBC on Wednesday that Trump knew exactly what was going on, and his lawyer has released several photos of Parnas with the president. Speaking to reporters at the White House, Trump repeated his assertion that he did not know Parnas. He called the whole thing a big hoax.

 “Oh my goodness! ‘Snitch’ is my absolutely least favorite word,” Fondren said. “I hear about that every single day when I go into middle schools and high schools. They’ll say, ‘Ms. Jenna, I don’t want to be a snitch. I don’t want to be a snitch.’”
 She said speaking up could save a life.
 “I’ve never ever had a student tell me that they regret reporting,” Fondren said. “I just have always heard students come up to me and say that they regret not reporting.”
 Schools are required to remove the student and place them in an alternative education program for at least 30 days but most likely they will get expelled.
 That’s on top of the legal consequences ... like jail time.

“My wife is kind of graphic, so I don’t know if my sister sent it to her, and there were five or six or seven teams on it and it was kind of cool,” he said. “As we started eliminating teams, ‘The Map’ became popular in the Dutcher house — graphically, color schemes, red, black on the whole map, half of the country, it was kind of fun to watch. I know the fans get a kick out of it.”
 On Wednesday night, someone posted a graphic of the solar system with the Aztecs’ logo on the moon and the planets.
 “I saw someone posted one, we’re on the map in the universe now,” Dutcher said. “We cover the moon and Mercury and Mars and Jupiter, San Diego State on all of them. So you can make the maps say whatever you want. It’s kind of cool right now. It’s a great conversation to have and fun to have.”
 Dutcher and his players cautioned that “The Map” is strictly for fun and that the Aztecs can’t take anything for granted.
 “It puts a bigger target on our back,” Dutcher said. “It does nothing other than make us a national story, but all the work lies ahead. We have to get ready for a very good Nevada team.”
 After winning 64-55 at Fresno State on Tuesday night, the Aztecs return home to sold-out Viejas Arena on Saturday night to host Nevada (11-7, 4-2). The Aztecs are two wins shy of matching the best start in school history, when they won their first 20 games in 2010-11 behind Kawhi Leonard. That team reached the Sweet 16 for the first time in school history.
 “Someone says today, ‘Is it hard to keep a young team focused?’ And I said, ‘That’s the good news, I don’t have a young team, I have an old team.’ These guys go to work every day. They know what the grind is. And we will prepare like crazy to play Nevada.”
 By old, he’s referring to the three transfers who have led SDSU back into the national spotlight. Guard Malachi Flynn, a junior transfer from Washington State, is leading the Aztecs with 16.6 points per game. Big man Yanni Wetzell, a graduate transfer from Vanderbilt, is averaging 11.9 points and 5.9 rebounds. Another grad transfer, guard KJ Feagin (Santa Clara), is averaging 8.1 points.

The Senate impeachment trial on whether to remove U.S. President Donald Trump from office formally began on Thursday even as a congressional watchdog found that the White House broke the law by withholding security aid for Ukraine approved by Congress. The assessment from the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office (GAO) was a setback for Trump, but it was unclear if it would figure in his trial in the Republican-led Senate given that key questions such as whether witnesses will testify or new evidence will be considered remain unanswered.
 Democrat Adam Schiff, who heads a team of seven House of Representatives members who will serve as prosecutors, appeared on the Senate floor to read the two charges passed by the House on Dec. 18 that accused Trump of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress arising from his dealings with Ukraine. U.S. Chief Justice John Roberts, wearing his black judicial robe, took an oath to preside over the trial and then swore in the assembled senators who will serve as jurors, asking if they would "do impartial justice."
 The 99 senators present signed their assent one by one. One senator - Republican Jim Inhofe \- was in his home state of Oklahoma to be with a family member facing a medical issue, according to his office, but was due to sign next week. The Senate is expected to acquit Trump, as none of its 53 Republicans has voiced support for removing him, a step that requires a two- thirds majority. Trump has denied wrongdoing and has called the impeachment process a sham.
 Opening statements were due to start on Tuesday. The abuse of power cited in the House articles of impeachment included Trump's withholding of $391 million in security aid for Ukraine, a move Democrats have said was aimed at pressuring Kiev into investigating political rival Joe Biden, the president's possible Democratic opponent in the Nov. 3 election.
 Congress had approved the funds to help Ukraine combat Russia-backed separatists. The money was ultimately provided in September after the controversy spilled into public view. The GAO said the U.S. Constitution does not grant a president authority to unilaterally withhold funds, as Trump did. Instead, a president can only withhold spending in limited circumstances spelled out by law, its report said.
 "Faithful execution of the law does not permit the President to substitute his own policy priorities for those that Congress has enacted into law," the GAO said on Thursday. The GAO's findings are not legally binding, but its reports are seen by lawmakers as objective, reliable and generally uncontested. It has no prosecutorial power.
 Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen, who sought the GAO investigation, said the findings undercut Republican arguments that there was nothing wrong with Trump's action. "We now have a clear, lucid finding that the Trump administration violated the law and we know that the president ordered the administration to commit an illegal act," he told Reuters.
 Republican Senator John Cornyn said that while there may have been a civil violation of the law, it was not a criminal matter and certainly not an impeachable act. "The Constitution says you impeach presidents for treason, bribery, and high crimes and misdemeanors. And it's none of those things," said Cornyn, a former judge.
 MONITORING AN AMBASSADOR? It is only the third impeachment trial in U.S. history and no president has been removed as a direct result of the process. Richard Nixon resigned in 1974 before the full House could vote to impeach him. The House impeached Andrew Johnson in 1868 and Bill Clinton in 1998, but the Senate did not convict them.
 House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the GAO report bolstered Democrats' argument that the Senate trial should include new evidence and hear from witnesses. Schiff indicated that the House prosecutors may call Lev Parnas, an associate of Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, if the Senate permits testimony in the trial.
 Documents released this week indicated Parnas, a Ukraine-born U.S. citizen, helped Giuliani investigate Biden and his son Hunter, and was also involved in monitoring the movements of former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch before Trump removed her in May. In an interview with Reuters, Giuliani said he pushed Trump to fire Yovanovitch but did not know if Parnas put her under surveillance.
 Giuliani said he was disappointed with Parnas' decision to cooperate with impeachment investigators. "I considered him a friend and I considered him to be a man who had character and now I consider him to be a man who will say whatever his phony lawyer wants him to say," Giuliani said.
 Parnas told MSNBC on Wednesday that Trump knew "exactly what was going on," and his lawyer has released several photos of Parnas with the president. Speaking to reporters at the White House, Trump repeated his assertion that he did not know Parnas. He called the whole thing a "big hoax."

INDIANAPOLIS — Canadian auto racer James Hinchcliffe is expected to compete in at least two IndyCar races this season after landing a sponsor on Thursday.
 Genesys, an American-based technology company, says it will sponsor Hinchcliffe for the Indianapolis Motor Speedway road-course race on May 9 and the Indianapolis 500 on May 24.
 The company says details on Hinchcliffe's team will be in announced in the coming weeks.
 Hinchcliffe, from Oakville, Ont., lost his seat with Arrow McLaren SP Racing after the 2019 season.
 McLaren came on board with Sam Schmidt and Ric Peterson's team following the season and opted to make a lineup change. Pato O'Ward and reigning Indy Lights champion Oliver Askew will drive for the team.
 The 33-year-old Hinchcliffe, one of the most popular IndyCar racers last decade, has been a full-timer in the series since 2011. He has won six races.
 "Hinchcliffe brings an incredible level of skill and charisma to IndyCar, not to mention his genuine empathy for other teams and drivers," Genesys CEO Tony Bates said in a statement.

She said it would cost her $920 to get it removed and she blamed the university for not having enough permits available for students.
 The University of Houston said that’s not the case.
 It only cost $75 to get it removed, with a $200 deposit if you return the device in the same condition.
 “It’s not $900 to remove it. It was the citation plus $200 deposit,” Hart said.
 The university wouldn't comment on this specific case but did say each parking ticket can cost anywhere from $30 to $60.
 They can double if you don’t pay them or adjust them within 20 days.
 The convenient thing about the device is you can instantly pay your fine on your phone. It sends you a code you put the code in and you can instantly remove the device.

 The university said there is a payment plan available and alternative transportation services for students that need them.

The senior class has raised just over $6,000, selling 250 games, in a matter of three days.
 The classic board game with a twist includes 22 Gloucester properties that can be purchased if players can budget correctly.
 The featured businesses — such as Primo Plastering LLC, Kerry's Salon, Village Silversmith, and Gorton's Seafood — donated anywhere from $300 to $500 to have a spot on the board.
 Free parking can be found at the Cape Ann Chamber of Commerce and you may be sent to Gloucester's Police Station if you have a bad roll of the dice.
 Creating a Monopoly-like board game as a means to raise money was brought to the students' attention by School Committeeman Joel Favazza, who graduated from the high school in 2003.
 "The impetus for this board game was that the class before me, in 2002, had made a similar board and made substantial money off of it," Favazza recalled.
 Favazza mentioned the idea, and the current students ran with it.
 For a year and a half, students worked with Favazza to graphically design the board, correspond with the manufacturer, boardgamemanufacturers.com, and reach out to local businesses about donating.
 "The students this time around did a great job," Favazza said. "I couldn't be more proud of what they did."
 The Student Council will be selling the game this Saturday, Jan. 18, in the high school's atrium from 8 a.m. to 10 a.m. Each board is $25 and all of the proceeds go toward supporting the Gloucester High Senior Class of 2020.
 If out-of-towners are interested in purchasing a game, the Student Council clarified that they will have to pay for the board, shipping, and shipping insurance.

 If the Great American Conference men's basketball season ended today, five Oklahoma schools could be traveling to Bartlesville for the conference's postseason championship tourney, set for the first weekend in March.
   
 Eight games deep into the conference schedule, East Central, Southeastern Oklahoma State and Henderson State are tied for first place at 6-2.
   
 Arkansas-Monticello, Oklahoma Baptist and Southern Nazarene are tied for fourth at 5-3.
   
 Arkansas Tech stands alone in seventh place at 4-4.
   
 Knotted for the No. 8 spot -- which will be the final berth in the tourney -- are Southwestern Oklahoma State and Ouachita Baptist at 3-5.
   
 Rounding out the standings are Northwestern Oklahoma State and Southern Arkansas at 2-6, and Harding at 1-7.
   
 In other words -- with 14 conference dates remaining -- all 12 teams are still in contention for the eight coveted tourney spots.
   
 One of the direct connections with Bartlesville is the Arkansas-Monticello team, which is coached by Kyle Tolin, whose dad Doug is a local native and a member of the Bartlesville Athletic Hall of Fame. Doug also has been an assistant in past seasons for Kyle.
   
 This is slated as the final year Bartlesville -- specifically the Bartlesville Sports Commission (BSC) -- will host the GAC tourney.
   
 The GAC list consists of six NCAA-II schools from Oklahoma and six from Arkansas.
   
 The Bartlesville Bruin Fieldhouse has been the only venue for the GAC basketball title tourney since the conference began competitive play in the 2011-12 school year.
   
 As of next year, the GAC tourney is scheduled to move to a Tulsa site.
   
 Actually, Bartlesville's time as host site was supposed to have ended in 2019. But, when the GAC found itself without a place to hold its 2020 tourney, the BSC stepped to the plate as a pinch-hitter.
   
 The tourney schedule will be an eight-team, single-elimination format. The winner will automatically advance to the NCAA-II regionals.
   
 Women's basketball
   
 On the women's side, three Oklahoma institutions top the current standings -- Southeastern Oklahoma State (7-1), Southwestern Oklahoma State (6-2) and Southern Nazarene (6-2).
   
 Tied at 5-3 for fourth place are Arkansas-Monticello, Henderson State and Arkansas Tech.
   
 Three other schools are knotted for seventh place, at 4-4 -- Southern Arkansas, Northwestern Oklahoma State and Harding.
   
 Rounding out the conference standings are Ouachita Baptist (1-7), East Central (1-7) and Oklahoma Baptist (0-8).
   
 Like the men, the ladies still have 14 conference games remaining.
   
 The tourney format at Bartlesville for the women will be the same as for the men, with the ladies' winning advancing to the NCAA-II women's regionals.
   
 Last year, Southwestern Oklahoma State won the GAC women's crown and powered all the way to the NCAA-II national championship game prior to losing.
   
 A member of that Southwestern Oklahoma team was Bartlesville High graduate Hailey Tucker, who has now graduated.

Ivey and Walker started the skirmish trading baskets in the first quarter, which ended tied at 13. Ivery had nine points to Walker’s six.
 Chaney broke an 18-18 tie with a couple of free throws and Angleton doubled its advantage when Walker fed Price inside for a bucket to make it 22-18. Shortly after, with 1:18 remaining until intermission, Walker went down in a scramble and had to leave the game. Ivey then pulled the Lady Falcons within a bucket with two free throws, but Angleton’s Carolynn Stallman answered with a long shot initially counted as a 3-pointer, but later changed to a two.
 Entering the third quarter up 25-21, rebounds helped the Ladycats extend their lead as they outscored the Lady Falcons, 14-6, in the period.
 Angleton will head to Fort Bend Marshall on Friday to continue district play.

Usually, when I write for the Old Colony Memorial, I strive to find balance in my presentation so as not to offend those who lean right or left. With our country so politically divided, it is an extremely difficult task. This time, I simply give up.
 Back last August, the OCM published my Food For Thought piece titled "United We Stand, Divided We Fall." Although that article dealt with the mass shootings in El Paso and Dayton, the central issue remains the same today. As a nation, we are so politically divided that it has become impossible for us to come together. Whether it be foreign policy or domestic issues, we can't seem to resolve problems or present a united front to those who wish to do us harm.
 When it comes to someone as evil as Qasem Soleimani, the commander of Iran's Quds Force, the fact that we can't speak with one voice is absolutely disgusting. Anyone who is responsible for the deaths of some 600 American soldiers, is an enemy of the American people. It doesn't matter whether we are on the left or right side of the political spectrum, he got what he so justly deserved. If he's now with his 17 virgins - good for him. At least he is no longer a threat to America or our people.
 And please, don't kid yourself. Whether you are on the left side or right side of the political spectrum, Soleimani considered you inhabitants of the Great Satan. The one thing we all have in common, as Americans, is that this terrible terrorist and his Quds associates, would have been happy to see you dead.
 We can score political points later. We can debate about the wisdom of the President's action in this regard in due course. For now, let's take a moment, as one united people, to recognize that an evil individual has been brought to his just demise. Celebrate our ability to track, target and eliminate him, without causing civilian casualties.
 Soleimani had become confident that the USA was impotent and lacked the fortitude to take him out. He traveled to Iraq to foment discord without the usual safeguards or operational security. His miscalculation resulted in him taking a hand gun to a Predator drone/Hellfire missile fight. Bye bye Soleimani. Good riddance!
 I am down in New Jersey today in support of my daughter who is recovering from an operation. On the way down, I was listening to Toby Keith sing, "Courtesy of the Red, White and Blue." The words struck a chord and reminded me of Qasem Soleimani and a time after 9/11 when we were united.
 Hey, Uncle Sam put your name

As it happens, however, the Pentagon's money for funding wall construction across the foot of the San Bernardino refuge itself comes from a different pot: "284" funds, intended for counter-narcotics work. Diverting $2.5 billion of these monies to the border wall was, to say the least, a stretch, so a coalition of humanitarian and environmental groups sued. A district court found in their favor and issued an injunction, halting the use of the funds for construction. A rapid series of appeals went to the Supreme Court and the Supremes said, _Hmmm, interesting question, which will take time for the lower courts to resolve; meanwhile, the injunctionis lifted_. And so funding again flowed like a flash flood. If the courts ultimately decide that the transfer of funds is really not okay, the wall may already have been built. Thank you, Supremes.

"The president has narrow, limited authority to withhold appropriations under the Impoundment Control Act of 1974," GAO general counsel Thomas H. Armstrong said in a statement. "OMB told GAO that it withheld the funds to ensure that they were not spent 'in a manner that could conflict with the president's foreign policy.'"

MONTGOMERY, Ala. (WAFF) - A potential game-changer for law enforcement is waiting for state lawmakers when they return to Montgomery.It’s titled the “Agent Billy Clardy III Act."Rep. Rex Reynolds, R-Madison County, prefiled House Bill 14, a bill that would allow law enforcement to wiretap felony drug offenders.The bill is filed in the aftermath of Clardy’s death on Dec. 6. Huntsville police said LaJeromeny Brown murdered Clardy when they came face to face in a drug investigation.Reynolds said the bill is designed to provide officers with safer options.“You know what if they had the ability to have a state wiretap and may have been able to go after that offender in a different way, other than a very volatile, dangerous, drug type, undercover type situation,” he said.The bill authorizes local law enforcement to wiretap felony drug offenders if the secretary of the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency, the state attorney general, and a circuit court judge all sign off.The wiretapping would be limited to felony drug cases and could only be used if all other methods have failed or are too dangerous to be attempted.Once the recording begins, officers would have a ticking clock (up to 30 days) to get what they need, but the judge could extend the recording time if he or she deems probable cause.The officers would be required to report to the judge during the recordings, and would have to turn over their recordings to the court.Madison County Sheriff’s Office spokesman investigator Brent Patterson said the bill would significantly help deputies on the streets.“I believe I can speak for everyone in law enforcement that something like this would be huge,” he said.Officers would be held to a strict standard on when and how they use the wiretapping technology and could face felonies if the power is misused.Patterson said deputies will “do our job.”“At the end of the day, we’re not going to worry about that kind of stuff. We’re going to do our job and we’re going to present it to the court system and let them decide, ‘hey did we do what is right?’ and ‘did we have the elements and the criteria in the laws to present it to a grand jury?’" he said.Representative Andy Whitt, R-Madison County, cosponsored the bill with Reynolds and said he doesn’t foresee any push back once other lawmakers take a look.“Any time you tap someone’s phone or a device that raises concerns, and it should raise concerns, but we’re targeting the worst of the worst, our drug traffickers, and we need to give this tool to our law enforcement to do their job,” he said.Reynolds said he worked with Rep. Chris England, D-Tuscaloosa, when writing the bill.WAFF 48 News reached out to England, but he has not yet returned a request for comment.The legislative session begins February 4th.Copyright 2020 WAFF.

Seven of the nine businesses that employ the volunteers also qualify. The town says another incentive is possible down the road for business owners who don't own their building.
 Coun. Briane Simpson said the tax rebate is the town's way of showing its appreciation.
 "I just really want to thank the businesses that allow their employees to go on emergency responses, and also I wanted to thank the volunteer firefighters."
 Local businesses can receive rebates of up to $2,000 per year based on response hours.
 The firefighters can get a maximum of $1,000 depending on how many hours they log.

The U.S.'s reflexive response to the tipping balance of power in the region is to rally South Korea and Japan into a trilateral alliance that cements Cold War divisions against China, Russia and North Korea. But this requires considerable arm-twisting of its allies. The Trump administration exerted unparalleled pressure on South Korea's Moon Jae-in government to reverse its decision to terminate an intelligence-sharing agreement with Japan -- a key to the trilateral alliance. What's more, the Trump administration recently demanded that South Korea pay $5 billion -- five times more than in the past -- for the cost of stationing U.S. troops there. This has sown growing resentment among South Koreans against the U.S.'s authority over their country's affairs and could lead to irreparable fissures in the U.S.- South Korea alliance.
