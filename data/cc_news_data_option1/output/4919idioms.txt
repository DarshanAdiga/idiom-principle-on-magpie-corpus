Riley Senne was just seven years old when his lifelong obsession and passion for music began with a violin.
   
 As he picked up the instrument, he kept playing and wanting to learn more about the instrument and more about music in general. Right around that same time, his father started learning how to play guitar, and just like the violin, Senne picked the guitar up too. He mostly taught himself how to play it, and play it well he did.
   
 He's hardly been without an instrument in hand since.
   
 Now a senior at Seaman High School, there isn't much about Senne's life that doesn't revolve around music. Several guitars adorn his basement studio, along with a bass, violin, drums, keyboard -- practically anything he's been able to get his hands on.
   
 "It's been pretty amazing seeing him ever since he was a kid being able to hear something and just replicate it on an instrument," Senne's father Brandon said. "For someone who isn't musical, it's hard to imagine how it happens, but he's always had that gift."
   
 It's a gift that made others quickly notice Senne, and Seaman High band director Cary Stahly was familiar with Senne's talent even before he became a student of his at the high school.
   
 "He's one of the very few people I've ever known who has perfect pitch," said Stahly. "You could hum a note, and he can tell you what note it is. If you find a student who can do that, you know that's a nice piece of that student's future."
   
 Senne is involved in most every music group and class he can take at school, and outside of the school, Senne performs around the community as a member of Carje, a band he made with three friends from a 2019 jazz camp.
   
 And after what's shaping up to be a disappointing year for music students who have lost their senior year performances, Senne has his eyes set on a career in music after being accepted into and earning a scholarship at the prestigious Berklee College of Music in Boston.
   
 "Music has always been something I can look to positively, especially this year," he said. "It puts my mind at ease, and I can channel things in my life toward it. It's never been a negative thing."
   
 It was about a year ago that Senne, Cameron Smith, Eric Patterson Jr. and Jacob Herring met in Senne's basement and started jamming together in what were the first musings of Carje, which was more of a jazz ensemble then. The group evolved to what Senne called a more "diversified sound," playing with a mixture of rock, R&B; and jazz influences.
   
 Carje has since played at several area venues, like Lago Vista Grill in Ozawkie or The Wheel Barrel in North Topeka (the band had a much quieter sound then, Senne explained). But even as Senne prepares to go 1,300 miles away to Boston, his and the band's dream is to maybe one day go on tour, after the pandemic eases restrictions on things like live performances.
   
 First, though, the band is hoping to play shows at bigger venues in the region, like in Lawrence or Kansas City, and to do that, they need samples of their work to send to the people who book those venues. That's why over four Sunday sessions in Senne's basement studio, the band put together its first EP called "Back to the Basics," which Senne said the band plans to release online on Friday.
   
 It's in performing in front of others that Senne said he feels most comfortable, but even then, nerves still get him occasionally. Each performance or gig presents its own challenges, he said, and as a small band, Carje has to do its own set up.
   
 Ever since the first time he performed in front of others, though, Senne said he knew it was something he never wanted to stop doing.
   
 "Once I get up there, and once we get through a couple of songs, all of those nerves melt away, and I let loose and enjoy myself," he said.
   
 At Berklee, Senne will study audio production and engineering, and he will work with some of the best music professors in the country. It's much of what he's been doing already working in his basement studio, but he acknowledged how much he has yet to learn.
   
 "I'm really excited to get a lot better at guitar and be around so many other people who are as passionate about music as I am. I just want to jam with as many people as I can."
   
 Stahly, who had never had a student accepted into Berklee before, said the school is an elite, world-renowned institution.
   
 "The fact that he's a Midwest kid invited to go to an eastern institution to study music among the best musicians in the world, it's an unbelievable journey for him," Stahly said.
   
 But for all of his skill, it's Senne's authenticity and humility that set him apart, Stahly said.
   
 "This won't be his last stop," Stahly said. "He's going to be well-known, and I know he can do it."

 A mostly white high school near Salt Lake City will replace its contentious Braves mascot after nearly 70 years, the principal said Monday, as school and professional sports teams face increasing backlash about using Native American names and symbols.
 Bountiful High School will start the process of selecting a "culturally sensitive mascot that will unite all stakeholders," Principal Aaron Hogge announced. He did not provide a timeline or what replacement names are being considered but said the class of 2021 will graduate as Braves.

I believe leaders and students in the past have had the best of intentions to create unity, respect, honor, courage and bravery when they used the Braves mascot."
 An informal mascot -- a student dressed up in feathers -- is no longer allowed at school events but calls for Bountiful to change the Braves name mounted this summer during a nationwide push for racial justice following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis and the NFL team in Washington dropping the Redskins name.
 Bountiful's logo also was changed in recent years from a Native American man to the letter "B" with a feather or arrow on it, Davis County School District spokesman Chris Williams said.

JACKSON, Miss. (WLBT) -Shoppers are are pouring into stores for the big deals and searching for the perfect holiday gifts during this season of giving.But this is also the time of year when the bad guys are looking for that perfect opportunity to steal those gifts.That’s why the Mississippi Insurance Department wants shoppers to take a few extra steps this holiday season to ensure your gifts don’t end up in the wrong hands.“There’s a couple of things, you want to make sure you secure your wallet and your purse so that you’re not a risk for a theft, and later down the line possibly identity theft,” said Beth Reiss, communications director for the Mississippi Insurance Department. “You want to make sure you’re locking your vehicle. Put purchases out of sight in the trunk or covered up in your backseat, however you do it so it’s not obvious that you have purchases in that vehicle.”With many people buying big ticket items, Reiss said it’s important everyone properly throw away holiday trash, because thieves could target your houses for your items.“You don’t want a huge tv box sitting out on the curb letting people know we just purchased a brand new flat screen TV,” said Reiss. “Make sure it’s put into a black garbage bag, tied up securely, so that it’s not attracting attention to your home, that may prevent someone from trying to break in.”Reiss said you should keep receipts and write down the serial numbers on anything you buy, that way it will be easier to track down your property should something happen to it.“One of the things that we also recommend is that if you’re going to be purchasing especially large gifts this year, maybe you’re getting a really nice piece of jewelry, art, some kind of computer, or TV that’s costly, you may want to add that to your homeowner’s insurance policy,” said Reiss.The state insurance department also encourages people to use an app on it’s website called, My Home Scr.APP.book.”It allows you take inventory of all of your merchandise, and helps you recoup them should they be stolen.“The great thing about that is when you go to file an insurance claim, it just makes things so much easier,” she said. “It means you’re going to get that claim filed faster and you’re probably going to see a return of your property, or a refund of your property that much faster.”Another measure in place to keep shoppers safe is “Operation Safe Shop.”It’s an initiative put in place by the Jackson Police Department.Throughout the shopping season, JPD will setup patrols at shopping centers giving an extra layer of protection to help ensure there’s no suspicious activity happening at at the stores.Copyright 2020 WLBT.

 # Neera Tanden, Biden's pick for budget chief, defends progressive credentials, deletes old tweets
 William Cummings
 USA TODAY
 President-elect Joe Biden has called for bipartisan unity since he announced his candidacy but the objections from both conservatives and progressives to his pick to head the White House Office of Management and Budget was likely not what he had in mind.
 Voices from the left and the right protested after Biden announced Monday he would nominate Neera Tanden, who heads the left-leaning Center for American Progress, as his budget chief at the same time he officially unveiled other senior members of his economics team, including Janet Yellen, whom he tapped as his Treasury secretary.
 As many conservatives derided her for being too liberal and many liberals dismissed her as too conservative, Tanden seemed to attempt to assuage the latter critics' concerns by pointing to her reliance on public food and housing programs as a child and vowed that as the director of OMB she would "help ensure those programs are secure."
 Biden's transition website also played up her humble background, saying she "relied on food stamps and Section 8 housing as a child – a social safety net that offered her single mother the foundation she needed to land a good job and punch her family’s ticket to the middle class." And it said her career had "focused on pursuing policies designed to support working families, foster broad-based economic growth, and curb rampant inequality."
 But such assurances appeared unlikely to sway progressives detractors like Brianna Joy Gray, the former press secretary for Sen. Bernie Sanders' 2020 presidential campaign, who tweeted, "Everything toxic about the corporate Democratic Party is embodied in Neera Tanden."
 Sanders, who would be the ranking Democrat on the Senate Budget Committee that will hold Tanden's confirmation hearings, and Tanden have had a strained relationship. Tanden worked on Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign, including her hard-fought primary campaign against the Vermont independent.
 In 2019, Sanders criticized the "destructive role" of the Center for American Progress under Tanden. "Neera Tanden repeatedly calls for unity while simultaneously maligning my staff and supporters and belittling progressive ideas," Sanders wrote in a letter.
 Gray and others pointed to comments Tanden made during her tenure as a health care reform adviser to former President Barack Obama where she expressed a willingness to include cuts to Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid in a budget deal with Republicans. Others decried her opposition to "Medicare for All."
 Not all progressive figures objected to Tanden's nomination. Former Labor Secretary Robert Reich said Tanden, along with Biden's other picks for his economic team, is "committed to full employment, boosting wages, reducing inequality."
 Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, tweeted, "Neera Tanden is smart, experienced, and qualified for the position of OMB Director." And he objected to Republican calls to block her nomination, saying, "The American people decisively voted for change – Mitch McConnell shouldn’t block us from having a functioning government that gets to work for the people we serve."
 "I agree," said Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.
 "Such a great choice to lead OMB," tweeted Rep. Barbara Lee, D-Calif. "@NeeraTanden will bring the experience and humanity urgently needed in this position. Congratulations!"
 Voting rights advocate Stacey Abrams also offered her congratulations.
 Many conservatives, who remember her as one of the architects of the Affordable Care Act, said they had no doubts about Tanden's liberal bona fides.
 "Neera Tanden is a big-government, big-spending radical liberal who’s a terrible choice for OMB Director," tweeted Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla. "It’s just more proof that @JoeBiden and the Democrats will continue to move further and further to the Left."
 Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., told The New York Times "she's not just a liberal ideologue, she’s a partisan activist who’s gone after senators of the majority party. She seems to have chosen a path that doesn’t lead to a senate confirmed office."
 Sen. John Cornyn told reporters Tanden was Biden's "worst nominee so far" because of caustic tweets she had posted in the recent past.
 "I think, in light of her combative and insulting comments about many members of the Senate, mainly on our side of the aisle, that it creates certainly a problematic path," he said. Earlier Monday, Drew Brandewie, Cornyn's communication director said Tanden "stands zero chance of being confirmed" because of an "endless stream of disparaging comments about the Republican Senators whose vote she'll need."
 The former chief of staff to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell tweeted that Tanden's nomination was a "sacrifice to the confirmation gods."
 Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. – who is expected to chair the Budget Committee – told reporters Tanden's confirmation could be an "uphill battle."
 Tanden has been highly critical of a number of Republican senators during the Trump administration – referring to them as the president's "enablers" – including McConnell whom she accused of "weakness and recklessness on Russia."
 A number of tweets appeared to have been deleted from Tanden's account Monday night, but according to The Wall Street Journal, she also once tweeted, "I’m glad McConnell is fiddling, while the markets burn."
 A look at the Internet Archive Wayback Machine showed that the number of tweets under Tanden's account declined from 88,600 on Nov. 16 to 87,600 as of Monday morning. By 8 p.m. EST Monday, the number of tweets on her account dropped to 87,500.
 A Google search for posts on McConnell under her account revealed at least four tweets that were no longer available.
 During the contentious confirmation hearings for Brett Kavanaugh, she accused Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, of making a "pathetically bad faith argument as cover for President Trump’s vicious attacks on survivors of sexual assault."
 "She is the worst," she said of Collins in another tweet at the time.
 Collins told reporters Monday she didn't know much about Tanden, "but I've heard that she's a very prolific user of Twitter."
 And the criticism of her Twitter activity extended to the left as well.
 Gray said Tanden was "a woman who is openly disdainful of Bernie Sanders and his coalition, but who is friendly with extreme bigots online."
 Tanden has been a prolific presence on Twitter, posting more than 87,000 tweets since joining in March 2010. By comparison, President Donald Trump has posted nearly 59,000 tweets since joining Twitter a year before Tanden.
 A number of Tanden's supporters dismissed the criticism, arguing many of those condemning her tweets had tolerated far worse from Trump.
 "Republican Senators who have coweredwa in fear over a mean Trump tweet now lashing out at Neera Tanden is a particularly severe case of cowardice," said Joe Lockhart, White House communications director under former President Bill Clinton.

So far, 2020 has forced us to stare down the unblinking abyss of life. But singer-songwriter Phoebe Bridgers stared right back at the abyss, wide-eyed, and screamed herself hoarse for good measure in her album outro. _Punisher_ stands as a testament to how unflinching Bridgers is in the face of pain, heart-ache, and peace. This album is her second release and proves she is a strong force in indie music who is not planning on stopping. Bridgers returned to music with her trademark ghostly vocals; she sounds almost hoarse and paper thin at times but proves to have incredible depth. Paired with her heart- wrenching lyrics (“I’m gonna kill you/ if you don’t beat me to it”), Bridgers accomplished what so few can do: she created compelling and distinct songs about sadness with varying shades of complex emotion that pair with each song. From disappointment about well-meaning but destructive lovers (“Moon Song”), or resenting an absentee father who beg for forgiveness (“Kyoto”), or even the slow resignation about the end of humankind altogether (“I Know the End”), Bridgers writes poignant and rich songs which speak not only to her vulnerability as a songwriter but how powerful she is at her craft. — Winona Young

I should mention that when my extended family and other relatives began to flee Oakland for the suburbs (my grandmother, who lived on Bancroft Avenue in East Oakland, was the last to sell out, in 1978,) the family flight had more to do with gang violence and indiscriminate shootings than radical politics. Oakland almost always appears near the top of lists of the most violent cities in the country. When violence merged with political ideology, as it did with groups like the Panthers, the connection was alarming to say the least.

 # Common things to be thankful for
 Steve Lekwa
 Naturally Speaking
 I have done some reading lately on the earliest days of settlement in our area. The pioneer families who came here settled land that was full of promise, but very much “in the raw.” Their possessions were few, and included basic farming tools and household goods, very basic foods like corn meal, and a change or two of clothing. A gun (muzzle-loading rifle or shotgun), a brace of oxen or horses and some seed for the first crop rounded out their entire set of resources. A few “more wealthy” families might have had a milk cow. It all had to fit in a small covered wagon, and whatever didn’t fit there had to walk or be carried by hand.
 The nearest trade centers were many miles and days of hard travel behind them in the 1850s when our area was first settled. The “raw” land they chose to homestead still had to provide the necessities that all life needs to survive. In wildlife terms we say that habitat (the land) must provide food, water and cover, and so it was for the pioneers.
 Game was a critical food resource to sustain pioneer families in their first years here, as were wild fruits and other edible wild plants. It would be months, maybe more than a year, before their own garden and crops could begin to provide some food. It took several years for industry to catch up with the pioneer front. The first few grain crops had to be ground at mills that were several day’s travel away. Few modern Iowans are more than a half hour from stores to supply all of their needs.
 We don’t even think about what a critical resource water is as we turn on the tap and watch it flow. The pioneers needed a daily water source from the first day they arrived. Streams of the day were clear and clean enough to drink from much of the time. That should be no surprise since surface runoff was well filtered by an unbroken blanket of prairie and wooded valleys.
 The water table under the undrained land was much higher than today, and most of the water flowing in streams of that time came from numerous springs. Locating near a spring was a big plus. Shallow wells could be hand-dug, too. It was 1872 before Torkel Henryson, one of Story City’s original Norwegians, drilled the first of what would be many deeper artesian, or flowing, wells that the area became somewhat famous for. Nearly every farm along and west of the Skunk River from Story City to northwest of Ames had one or more flowing wells by 1900. Water is still bubbling from a few of those old “flows” with no assistance from a pump.
 Shelter meant building a home in which a family could survive long Iowa winters. Wooded valleys provided logs for building cabins and a simple barn for the stock. The valleys also provided some shelter from prairie fires. Cutting trees for the cabin served a second purpose: the cleared areas became the first farm fields.
 We become frustrated when we can’t find enough room to store our “stuff” even in homes with garages, multiple rooms and basements. The pioneer’s cabin was often a single room with maybe a sleeping loft up under the roof.
 We pull on wonderful sweaters, down vests, and Gore-tex lined coats to keep warm and dry outdoors. The pioneer family might have resorted to some itchy woolen underwear and outerwear.
 We just crank up the thermostat another degree or two if we’re chilly indoors. Hand-cut and split wood was the only source of heat for homes and cooking until well after the Civil War. Early prairie farms had to travel to their “wood lots” (small wooded tracts in the valleys acquired along with a prairie farm) to cut their fuel and building materials.
 My writing station is in our basement, and is often a bit cooler than the more comfortable upstairs. I am wearing a down vest as I write this morning, over my soft, comfortable cotton clothing. I’m thankful that I don’t have to wear itchy wool next to my skin to keep me from freezing. There’s a pot of hot tea upstairs and multiple choices of what I might eat in the refrigerator and freezer. My chainsaw cut the firewood in my wood rack in the back yard, but I hand-split most of it. We use it for “recreational fires” in the living room fireplace. I’m thankful that I didn’t have to hand-cut and split a year’s supply just to survive.
 I can call my doctor and usually get to see him in a day or two if I’m sick. Pioneers were their own doctors with limited “medicines” they gleaned from the land, just as the Native Americans who lived here before them. There were no video calls to distant relatives “back east,” and only a few letters might be exchanged in a year.
 We may not be feeling too thankful in this most unusual year. Although life was very hard for pioneer families, they were still thankful, hopeful, and believed that the future would be better. We have much to be thankful for in spite of today’s problems, and I believe that the future will, indeed, be better.

FAYETTEVILLE Unlike some angry that their opposition cites too many COVID-19 related absences to play a football game, (review Clemson Coach Dabo Swinney's lingering outrage two Saturdays ago when Florida State withdrew from its Clemson game on game day morning in Tallahassee, Fla.,) the Missouri Tigers ought to be grateful to Arkansas.
   
 Because the Razorbacks on Nov. 24 announced their healthy numbers were below SEC protocol to play last Saturday's game against Mizzou, the Tigers were free to make up their earlier season postponed game with winless Vanderbilt.
   
 Vandy suddenly also had open date last Saturday because scheduled opponent Tennessee was too stricken with positive COVID-19 tests and contract tracing related quarantines.
   
 So while the 3-5 Razorbacks rested their ill, Mizzou, now 4-3, rose above .500 well vanquishing Vandy, 41-0 at Faurot Field in Columbia, Mo. where they'll host Arkansas this Saturday.
   
 Arkansas was to host No. 1, 8-0, Alabama on Saturday at Reynolds Razorback Stadium but presumably will play that game on Dec. 12 here provided both teams are sufficiently healthy.
   
 Alabama uses this Saturday to make up its earlier postponed game against LSU.
   
 With last week's unaccustomed open date during Thanksgiving and needing more to restore his team's health than work his threadbare roster with hard practices, Arkansas Coach Sam Pittman gave his Razorbacks off after Wednesday's walkthrough and meetings through returning Sunday to launch Monday's game-week preparations and resumption of UA classes.
   
 "We're certainly hoping that we can get our players back by injury, by COVID, by quarantine," Pittman told media before last Wednesday's walkthrough. "We're very positive that we'll be able to play next week."
   
 Since Pittman was impressed with Mizzou and first-year Mizzou Coach and Alma native Eliah Drinkwitz last week, he presumably is all the more impressed after the Tigers skunked Vandy.
   
 "Missouri is very physical on both sides of the ball," Pittman said last week. "I really like (Mizzou defensive end) Tre Williams. I like their D-line. Nick Bolton is probably as good of a linebacker as there is in the SEC, probably in the country.
   
 (cornerback Ennis) Rakestraw and (safety Tyree) Gillespie and those guys in the back end are playing very physical football.
   
 Defensively, they run to the football. (Middle linebacker Devin) Nicholson had one heck of an interception to seal the game against South Carolina."
   
 Mizzou offensively?
   
 "They're very big and very physical on the offensive line," Pittman said. "They like to run the ball. Coach Drinkwitz does a great job of keeping your off balance . But if he can run the ball, he's going to turn around and hand if off, a lot like Tennessee did."
   
 Senior running back Larry Rountree, who seems like he's been on Mizzou's campus longer than its fabled Columns, has more career rushing yards, 3,398, than any Mizzou running back ever.
   
 "Rountree is a very, very solid, tough and physical runner," Pittman said. "(Connor) Bazelak is getting better each week. A young freshman quarterback. They've done a nice job with their transfer portal outside with their wide outs, junior college wise and transfer portal, they've got some nice wide outs as well. Very, very well coached and very good in special teams. Just a really, really good football team."
   
 A team that first-year Arkansas defensive coordinator Barry Odom left well- stocked from his 2016-2019 Mizzou head coaching tenure.
   
 Pittman, the Georgia offensive line coach from 2016-2019 debuting as Arkansas' head coach vs. Georgia in the 37-10 loss Sept. 26 in Fayetteville, was asked about Odom's feeling as a Mizzou grad and former Mizzou linebacker, defensive coordinator and head coach, returning to Columbia against his old school.
   
 "He played there, he's an alumni there, was a head football coach there and probably recruited a majority of the players that they have there," Pittman said. "I think he has a lot of love for his former players. At the same time, the University of Arkansas is paying him. He wants to do a great job for Arkansas. I'm sure there's a little bit of mixed feelings, just as I had playing against Georgia. But the bottom line is that Barry's a competitor and he will certainly have our football team ready to play."

(AP) - Stocks pulled back slightly from their record levels Monday as Wall Street put a quiet coda on one of its most rocking months in decades.The S&amp;P 500 fell 0.5%, but the benchmark index still clocked a surge of 10.8% for the month, its biggest monthly gain since April. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which has far less impact on 401(k) accounts than the S&amp;P 500 does, had its best month since 1987.The market’s slide followed reports showing how the worsening pandemic is dragging down the economy in the near term. But most investors are looking beyond that. The market’s strong November gains reflect Wall Street latching on to hopes that the economy will get closer to normal next year and strengthen in the long term. That scenario hinges largely on&nbsp;promising coronavirus vaccines&nbsp;being rolled out in coming weeks and, eventually, leading to fewer new virus cases, which have been increasing.“Today’s pullback in equities is a sidestep in a market that seems poised to trend higher,” said Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management. “We still think the market trends higher into the new year.”The S&amp;P 500 lost 16.72 points to 3,621.63. The Dow fell 271.73 points, or 0.9%, to 29,638.64. The Nasdaq composite slipped 7.11 points, or 0.1%, to 12,198.74. The S&amp;P 500 and Dow are close to their record levels, and the Dow crested the 30,000 level last week for the first time.Several big forces are behind this month’s surge, beginning with the clearing of some of the uncertainty that had dogged markets leading into the U.S. elections. Now, Democrat Joe Biden is firmly in place as the president-elect in Wall Street’s eyes, and investors have avoided their worst-case scenario of weeks or months of limbo with an unknown winner.Investors also found encouragement in prospects that Washington will remain under divided political control. Republicans are on track to hold onto control of the Senate if they can win one of two upcoming runoff elections in Georgia. A split government would mean low tax rates and other pro-business policies could remain the status quo.But the turbocharger for the market’s move higher has been a huge dose of hope as pharmaceutical companies come closer to delivering vaccines to a world beaten down by the COVID-19 pandemic. Several have reported encouraging data recently suggesting their vaccine candidates are highly effective.Moderna said it would ask U.S. and European regulators Monday to&nbsp;allow emergency use&nbsp;of its COVID-19 vaccine. Its shares jumped 20.2% Monday.Moderna follows Pfizer and German partner BioNTech in seeking to begin vaccinations in the U.S. in December. British regulators also are assessing the Pfizer shot and another from AstraZeneca.That’s helped the stock market’s rally broaden out. Early in Wall Street’s recovery this spring, it was Big Tech that almost singlehandedly carried the market higher on expectations that work-from-home and other trends would mean bigger profits for them. But hopes for a more widespread economic recovery are now boosting stocks of companies whose profits are more closely tied to the economy’s strength.Energy stocks in the S&amp;P 500 ended November with a nearly 27% gain. It’s a sharp turnaround from earlier this year, when oil prices plunged as the pandemic kept airplanes, trucks and factories around the world idled or slowed.Financial stocks have also been big winners on expectations that a stronger economy will create a stronger job market and higher interest rates. That could mean more people paying back loans made at more profitable rates for banks.Many of those stocks, though, gave back some of their big gains Monday following discouraging economic reports and as investors locked in some profits from their big recent gains. Apache lost 7.4% and American Airlines fell 2.7%.Likewise, the Russell 2000 index of smaller stocks, which closed out November with an 18.3% surge, fell 35.45 points, or 1.9%, to 1,819.82 Monday.Many of the gains in November were justified by the good news from vaccine development, but markets will likely see more churning ahead, said Katie Nixon, chief investment officer at Northern Trust Wealth Management.“You’ll see a diminishing impact from vaccine-related news and much more focus on when the economic recovery will take hold in a more organic way,” she said.A report on Monday morning showed that growth in business activity in the Chicago area slowed more than economists expected. A separate report said that the pace of&nbsp;pending sales of homes&nbsp;was slower in October than expected. They’re the latest data to suggest the resurgent pandemic is dragging on the economy, including a pickup in layoffs.With coronavirus counts and hospitalizations surging across the United States, Europe and elsewhere, governments are bringing back varying degrees of restrictions on businesses. An additional worry for markets is that the worsening pandemic will keep customers hunkered at home regardless of what kind of stay-at-home orders arrive. Experts are warning of a potentially brutal winter.IHS Markit&nbsp;jumped 7.4% for Monday’s biggest gain in the S&amp;P 500 after S&amp;P Global said it would buy the data provider in a deal valued at $44 billion, including $4.8 billion of debt. S&amp;P Global rose 3%.European and Asian markets ended broadly lower. The yield on the 10-year Treasury ticked up to 0.84% from 0.83% late Friday.___AP Business Writer Yuri Kageyama contributed.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

After waxing moderate in her 2002 run-off election for District Attorney of San Francisco–she pledged never to seek the death penalty—she got busy and the conviction rate for individuals Hillary Clinton called “super-predators” skyrocketed by 2009 from 50 to 76 percent. This would seem to indicate a predilection for law-and-order.

Human rights activists and religious leaders in Vietnam and Myanmar are expressing reservations about President-elect Joe Biden’s ability to keep authoritarians in check.
 It might seem counterintuitive that Asian defenders of democracy are among the most ardent supporters of Trump, who has declared his friendship with Xi Jinping of China and Kim Jong Un of North Korea. But it is precisely Trump’s willingness to flout diplomatic protocol, abandon international accords and keep his opponents off-balance that have earned him plaudits as a leader strong enough to stand up to dictators and defend democratic ideals overseas, even if he has been criticized as diminishing them at home.
 As Biden now assembles his foreign-policy team, prominent human rights activists across Asia are worried about his desire for the United States to hew again to international norms. They believe that Biden, like former President Barack Obama, will pursue accommodation rather than confrontation in the face of China’s assertive moves. And their pro-Trump views have been cemented by online misinformation, often delivered by dubious news sources, that Biden is working in tandem with communists or is a closet socialist sympathizer.
 "Biden is president, and it’s like having Xi Jinping sitting in the White House,” said Elmer Yuen, a Hong Kong entrepreneur who has posted YouTube videos criticizing the Chinese Communist Party, or CCP. "He wants to coexist with China, and whoever coexists with the CCP loses.”
 With Trump’s presidential tenure in its twilight, these activists are calling for the administration to make a final stand against Asian autocrats, similar to a last-ditch effort to expand the border wall with Mexico.
 Secretary of State Mike Pompeo took a five-nation swing through Asia in October in which he abandoned politesse and described the Chinese government as a "predator,” "lawless and threatening,” and "the gravest threat to the future of religious freedom.” The tour was meant as a counterweight to China in a region where Beijing’s dollar diplomacy has bought significant influence.
 In November, Lobsang Sangay became the first head of the Tibetan government- in-exile to visit the White House; the provocative invite infuriated Beijing, which considers Sangay to be a separatist.
 In June, Pompeo attended a virtual gathering with Hong Kong democracy leader Joshua Wong and President Tsai Ing-wen of Taiwan, both of whom are loathed by the Chinese government.
 Trump’s popularity is particularly enduring among Christians, such as Chinese- born legal scholars chafing against communism’s atheist core and ethnic minority activists in Southeast Asia. Pompeo and other Trump administration officials, they believe, have been fulfilling a faith-based mission overseas.
 Last year, Trump met in the White House with a group of religious leaders from across the world, including Hkalam Samson, president of the Kachin Baptist Convention, which represents the persecuted Christian Kachin minority in Myanmar.
 "My experience in the White House, when I was given one minute to speak out about the Kachin, meant a lot, and it also meant that Trump cares about us,” Samson said. "Trump is better for the Kachin than Biden.”

Stocks pulled back slightly from their record levels Monday as Wall Street put a quiet coda on one of its most rocking months in decades.


  The S&P 500 fell 0.5%, but the benchmark index still clocked a surge of 10.8% for the month, it’s biggest monthly gain since April. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which has far less impact on 401(k) accounts than the S&P 500 does, had its best month since 1987.


  The market’s slide followed reports showing how the worsening pandemic is dragging down the economy in the near term. But most investors are looking beyond that. The market’s strong November gains reflect Wall Street latching on to hopes that the economy will get closer to normal next year and strengthen in the long term. That scenario hinges largely on promising coronavirus vaccines being rolled out in coming weeks and, eventually, leading to fewer new virus cases, which have been increasing.

WILBARGER COUNTY, Texas (TNN) - In Wilbarger County, concerns grow over COVID-19 as cases to continue rise and death tolls reach new heights. Vernon Mayor Pam Gosline is also worried that the virus could impact things like emergency medical services or the police and fire department.“When our staff is quarantined and come down with COVID, it gets serious because you can’t stop it, you can’t just turn it on and off,” said Mayor Gosline.On Saturday, Vernon ISD decided to go to virtual learning starting tomorrow as cases failed to decrease over the holiday weekend.“Out of extreme precaution, we visited with board members and administrators and across the board, we felt like it was better for us to be over-cautious than under for lack of a better term,” said Vernon ISD Superintendent Jeff Byrd.Byrd said it was a difficult decision as some parents may have a tough time accommodating for virtual learning.

Workers on the front lines of a pandemic that has killed more than 266,000 people in the United States and infected more than 13 million others are recognized in the Red Room with a Christmas tree dotted with handmade ornaments, as well as other decorations around the parlor.
 The gingerbread White House — a sweet confection made of more than 400 pounds (181 kilograms) of dough, gum paste, chocolate and royal icing — is on display in the State Dining Room and for the first time includes the Rose Garden, which the first lady recently renovated, and the First Ladies’ Garden.
 Ornaments on the official White House Christmas tree in the Blue Room — a Fraser fir from Shepherdstown, West Virginia, that stands more than 18 feet (5.49 meters) tall — were designed by students who were asked by the National Park Service to depict what makes their states beautiful.
 A buck and a crane are featured in three-dimensional art hanging in windows of the Green Room, where American wildlife is the highlight. Classical urns lining an East Wing walkway hold groupings of foliage from different regions of the country.
 Trees and other decorations in the East Room feature planes, trains and automobiles — including models of Air Force One — in a nod to triumphs in innovations and technology. Wrapped gifts beneath decorated trees lining the Cross Hall bear tags that say “peace,” “love,” “faith” and “joy.”
 Monday’s unveiling of the Christmas decor came weeks after Mrs. Trump was heard on an audio recording using profanity as she complained about the pressure of having to decorate for the holiday in the past. The recording of the July 2018 conversation was made and released to CNN by Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, who was fired from the White House earlier that year.
 Wolkoff published a tell-all book about her friendship and breakup with Mrs. Trump, whom Wolkoff blames for not defending her after questions arose about spending for Trump’s 2017 inauguration, which Wolkoff helped produce.
 This year some 125 volunteers from around the country used 62 trees, 106 wreaths, more than 1,200 feet (366 meters) of garland, more than 3,200 strands of lights and 17,000 bows to decorate the 132-room White House over the course of Thanksgiving weekend.
 The library is decorated to recognize the 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment, giving women the right to vote. Stockings for the president, first lady and their 14-year-old son Barron hang from a fireplace in the room where presidential china patterns are displayed.
 After previewing the decorations for the media, the White House on Monday planned the first of many holiday receptions that are expected to be smaller in size given coronavirus concerns.
 A few miles north of the White House, the wrapping also came off the Christmas decorations at Vice President Mike Pence’s official residence on the grounds of the Naval Observatory.
 Karen Pence said “Old Fashioned Christmas” is their theme. The home is decorated with natural and rustic elements, including pine cones, seasonal berries, burlap, galvanized aluminum and plaid ribbon, along with seven Christmas trees and 35 wreaths.

We have a request for President Trump: Broker a deal on a stimulus package.
   
 This might be your last big opportunity of your presidency to show the American people what you're capable of. Please don't waste it. This is the decent thing to do. The right thing to do.
   
 So many people are hurting and could really use the money a stimulus package could provide. The first package came when we needed it most, and we'd like to remind you that another was also promised.
   
 Does the campaign slogan "promises kept" ring a bell? This is something you could be the driving force on. Just get it done.
   
 Can you imagine what that could do for people, Mr. President? It might be the difference for folks having to choose between rent and food. It might mean some folks might have an actual holiday season when they otherwise might not. It might help some people pay off some debt they've accrued since the pandemic or help a millennial pay off a student loan.
   
 Each person has a different circumstance. but everyone has a need.
   
 For small businesses -- the life force of our communities -- it might mean the difference before keeping their doors open in 2021.
   
 No matter what, it would help.
   
 So we'd really like to see you make an effort to get a package delivered to your desk to sign. This is a moment we believe you can meet. You don't have to leave the White House. Start making calls. Tell Mitch McConnell it's a go. Tell Sens. Pat Roberts and Jerry Moran to make it happen. U.S. Rep. Roger Marshall. too.
   
 We have faith you can get it done if you try.
   
 We highly doubt the Democrats will fight you on this, but know that the American people want a stimulus.
   
 To hold one ransom during a pandemic to score political points would be immoral. Show us you know the art of a deal.
   
 Go out with a bang and give the United States the stimulus it needs to keep the economy firing on all cylinders.

While China has adopted a more aggressive "Wolf Warrior” diplomacy epitomized by the Afghan tweet on Monday, it has also used different levels to punish countries that step out of line. Earlier this year, the Communist Party-backed Global Times newspaper said China should deliver "public and painful” retaliation to the U.K. for banning Huawei but avoid a full-fledged confrontation because it saw Britain as the "weak link” in the Five Eyes.
 In a phone call with his EU counterpart Josep Borrell last week, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi also sent a tacit warning that the bloc should think twice before strengthening alliance with the incoming Biden administration, as the two sides look to complete an investment treaty by the end of the year. "Strategic autonomy is a necessary character for staying independent,” Wang said, adding that it involves "opposing man-made ‘decoupling’, opposing confrontation among different blocs and a new ‘Cold War.’”
 Australia, on the other hand, has faced China’s unabashed wrath ever since Morrison’s government called for Beijing to allow independent investigators into Wuhan to discover the origins of COVID-19. Chen Hong, director of the Australian Studies Centre at East China Normal University who said he had his visa to Australia revoked this year because he was labeled a national security risk, said Australia’s actions differentiated it from New Zealand, which maintained relatively good ties with Beijing.
 "Australia has been purposefully echoing the Washington’s anti-China policy and coordinated with Trump’s strategic intentions,” Chen said.

 # Make a plan for 2021 for better things in the new year.
 Chris Worthy
 View Comments
 The only certainty in plans for 2020 was that there was no way to make certain plans in 2020. But we’re all hoping for better things in the new year.
 Katie Henry, Chief Marketing Officer at The Happy Planner, said the second half of 2020 has seen many of her customers planning outside the normal scope of what they do. Many have taken time for what Henry calls “memory planning” – journaling and recording what they were doing in their homes or virtually in this very odd year.
 “They wanted to lean into how they were feeling,” Henry said. “We’ve never experienced anything like this, so I think documenting it – good or bad – was helping people relieve anxiety or stress.”
 Planning is more than just recording work, family and volunteer appointments on a calendar. Henry said creative journaling is used by many as a way to slow down and even as a form of self-care.
 For the new year, we all have to find that balance of maintaining flexibility and being ready to bolt for vacations and the other parts of life we have missed and will no longer take for granted.
 “It’s important to respect the time we’re in but find something to look forward to,” Henry said.
 For short-term planning, consider keeping an old-fashioned check-off list. Write down the day’s tasks and take a moment to reflect on them at the end of the day.
 “Write down accomplishments, even small things,” Henry said. “It’s always nice to cross something off the list.”
 For families who are juggling work, home and virtual schooling or homeschooling, getting the calendar – even it’s a schedule of Zoom meetings – in hand is critical.
 “Start small,” Henry said. “You don’t have to get it right the first day.”
 If it all seems overwhelming, remember to think big for long-range goals, post-pandemic dream trips and more, but zoom in on your calendar until it feels manageable.
 “Do things in snackable bites,” Henry said. “If you can’t plan the month, plan the week. Take everything in your brain that’s keeping you up – all the lists – and do a brain dump. Write it all down.”
 Then, break those lists down into priorities. What must get done first?
 “Once you look at it that way, it’s less stressful,” Henry said. “It doesn’t have to be overwhelming if you take it one step at a time.”

Still, in an early sign that Beijing’s Afghan tweet may have galvanized some of Australia’s partners into responding, New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said on Tuesday that her own diplomats had directly registered concern with Chinese authorities over the "unfactual post.” Lawmakers in the U.K. also condemned China’s actions, with former Conservative party leader Iain Duncan Smith urging Britain to do more to stand with Australia, the Sydney Morning Herald reported.
 In Canberra, Australian officials have said Morrison’s government is speaking out for its own interests regardless of the U.S. on issues like China’s increasing grip over Hong Kong and assertiveness in the South China Sea. Morrison himself has also sought to portray Australia as stuck in the middle of the U.S. and China — a view also shared by Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, who said in an interview this month that many nations in Asia aren’t keen to join an anti-China bloc.
 Even after he called on China to apologize for the Afghan tweet on Monday, Morrison again sought to restart talks with Beijing with no conditions.
 "Countries around the world are watching this, they are seeing how Australia is seeking to resolve these issues and they are seeing these responses,” Morrison told reporters on Monday. "This impacts not just on the relationship here, but with so many other sovereign nations not only in our own region, but like-minded countries around the world.”
 The spat has only hardened attitudes toward China within Australia, to the point where even business groups have stopped pushing for warmer ties, according to Natasha Kassam, a former Australian diplomat who worked in China and is now a research fellow at the Sydney-based Lowy Institute. At the same time, she said, it’s "impossible to imagine” China apologizing to Australia.
 "While there may be an emboldening of countries in the region responding to China,” she said, "it’s equally likely that a number of countries will see the way in which Australia’s export industry has been punished and think twice about making their own criticisms.”

State wildlife professionals wonder if a mountain lion caught on camera in late October in southwest Kansas has become the first of its species known to have come to Kansas and stayed.
   
 The state has had 21 confirmed mountain lion sightings since 2007, but all of those prior to last month appeared to be young adult cats who were on the move, the Kansas Department of Wildlife and Parks said Sunday on its Facebook page.
   
 The most recent siting came at 10 a.m. Oct. 24 when an adult mountain lion was photographed by a trail camera in Kiowa County in southwest Kansas, said Megan Mayhew, communications manager for KDWPT.
   
 That agency on Sunday evening on its Facebook site posted a photo of the mountain lion, which was carrying a recently killed porcupine in its mouth.
   
 "This is cool!" that post said.
   
 The post by early Monday afternoon had reached more than 300,000 Facebook users in less than 24 hours as a result of people sharing it and tagging others in comments, Mayhew said.

 Trail cameras are set up along trails and rigged to automatically capture images of any wildlife that pass by, said Matt Peek, an Emporia-based wildlife research biologist for the KDWPT.
   
 He said the photo taken Oct. 24 by a trail camera put out by a Kiowa County resident is unique because it was taken in the same general vicinity where mountain lion sitings were reported two and a half months earlier.
   
 The KDWPT said in Sunday's Facebook post, "This photo follows three earlier confirmations (20 miles total apart) in the same area 2.5 months ago, which biologists assumed was the same cat headed south."
   
 Sunday's Facebook post added: "This is the first time multiple photos of a cat have been confirmed in the same area within a time frame that could indicate the presence of a resident lion. However, it's too early to tell because it could be a different lion coincidentally in the same area."
   
 Peek said he would be interested to see if trail cameras set up in the area involved capture more images in coming weeks of the mountain lion photographed Oct. 24.
   
 Mountain lion populations can be found in parts of Nebraska and Colorado but the species has not been known to live in Kansas, he said.
   
 Kansas has never had any confirmed reports of livestock being killed by mountain lions, Peek said.
   
 He said that while residents in some cases have suspected that mountain lions killed their livestock, in each of those situations authorities either could not make a determination or they concluded the livestock were killed by something else.
   
 While any mountain lion that tries to kill a porcupine is at risk of getting "a mouth full of quills," Peek said, wildlife professionals from other states tell him some mountain lions become pretty adept at flipping porcupines over and getting to their underside.
   
 The mountain lion in the photo shot Oct. 24 appears to have the recently killed porcupine by the chest, he said.
   
 Porcupines are scattered throughout Kansas, Peek said.
   
 "They're not real common anywhere, but they're most common in south-central and southwest Kansas," he said.

Between 75% and 80% of Americans who have a Christmas tree now have an artificial one, and the $1 billion market for fake trees has been growing by about 4% a year — despite them being reusable.
 No one tracks annual sales of real trees because independent tree lots are so scattered, but those in the business estimate about 20 million trees or more are sold each year, most of them at big box stores such as Costco and Home Depot.
 Oregon, the nation’s No. 1 supplier of fresh-cut trees, expects to ship nearly 6 million evergreens this season to places as far away as Japan and China. Other top tree exporters are Washington state, North Carolina and Pennsylvania.
 The fresh-cut tree industry in 2018 launched a social media campaign called “It's Christmas. Keep It Real!” to attract young families and media-savvy millennials.
 This year, the Christmas Tree Promotion Board also asked Rob Kenney, creator of the “Dad, How Do I?” YouTube channel, to make an instructional video for newbies on how to shop for and put up a real tree, then keep it alive. It's gotten tens of thousands of views.

PEARL, Miss. (WLBT) - A Jackson woman is behind bars in Rankin County after leading Pearl Police on a short chase.But she almost got away with it.Jasmine Naugles, 28, was being held at the Rankin County Jail, awaiting her first appearance in Pearl Municipal Court, after being arrested by Pearl police Sunday.An officer attempted to pull Naugles over at I-20 near Pearson Road, when she fled. She eventually led police north onto I-55 and into downtown Jackson, before crashing into several cars near the Standard Life Building, said Pearl Public Information Officer Greg Flynn.“The officer said they were going to call the chase off until she started to crash into parked cars down there,” he said. “They followed her a little more. She did stop, and they took her into custody.”Flynn said no one was injured in the chase and wasn’t sure how many vehicles were damaged. “I know she hit several parked cars, all unoccupied.”She is expected to make her first appearance in court on Tuesday, before Pearl Municipal Judge Richard Redfern.Flynn could not say why Naugles gave chase. He was unaware if she had any warrants and said no drugs or alcohol were found in her vehicle.“The officer tried to pull her over because she didn’t have any headlights on and it was nighttime,” he said.Driving without headlights is a misdemeanor charge, meaning Naugles likely would not have been arrested.“It always makes it worse when you run,” she said. “Then, you get felony fleeing on top of that.”Naugles is facing one count of felony fleeing, as well as misdemeanor charges for driving without insurance and driving without headlights.Jackson Police Department was contacted by Pearl when officers entered the city limits. JPD was not involved in the chase.“Our policy, as soon as we enter into another city, we get (that city) on the phone to let them know where we are,” he said. “She got off the interstate and had made it just into downtown.”If your vehicle was damaged in the chase, contact JPD at (601) 960-1234 or Pearl Police at (601) 939-7000.Copyright 2020 WLBT.

 We have a request for President Trump: Broker a deal on a stimulus package.
 This might be your last big opportunity of your presidency to show the American people what you're capable of. Please don't waste it. This is the decent thing to do. The right thing to do.
 So many people are hurting and could really use the money a stimulus package could provide. The first package came when we needed it most, and we'd like to remind you that another was also promised.
 Does the campaign slogan \"promises kept\" ring a bell? This is something you could be the driving force on. Just get it done.
 Can you imagine what that could do for people, Mr. President? It might be the difference for folks having to choose between rent and food. It might mean some folks might have an actual holiday season when they otherwise might not. It might help some people pay off some debt they've accrued since the pandemic or help a millennial pay off a student loan.
 Each person has a different circumstance. but everyone has a need.
 For small businesses -- the life force of our communities -- it might mean the difference before keeping their doors open in 2021.
 No matter what, it would help.
 So we'd really like to see you make an effort to get a package delivered to your desk to sign. This is a moment we believe you can meet. You don't have to leave the White House. Start making calls. Tell Mitch McConnell it's a go. Tell Sens. Pat Roberts and Jerry Moran to make it happen. U.S. Rep. Roger Marshall. too.
 We have faith you can get it done if you try.
 We highly doubt the Democrats will fight you on this, but know that the American people want a stimulus.
 To hold one ransom during a pandemic to score political points would be immoral. Show us you know the art of a deal.
 Go out with a bang and give the United States the stimulus it needs to keep the economy firing on all cylinders.

“The season is running approximately six to seven days ahead of what we've seen in the past. We’ve never seen the demand like we’ve had this year,” said McKenzie Cook, who ships between 1.8 million and 2 million trees a year combined from McKenzie Farms in Oregon and Happy Holiday Christmas Trees in North Carolina.
 A number of reasons are driving the uptick in interest. More Americans are staying home for the holidays amid pandemic restrictions and are realizing that for the first time in years — or maybe ever — they will be home to water a fresh-cut tree. With holiday parades and festivals canceled, stir-crazy families also are looking for a safe way to create special memories.
 Plus, fresh-cut Christmas trees are largely displayed outside, where there's a lower risk of viral spread, said Marsha Gray, executive director of the Christmas Tree Promotion Board.
 The national organization says industry research tells them many people who put up an artificial tree last year plan to buy a real tree this year, and most are citing the pandemic as the reason.
 “Yes, it’s a product, it’s a decoration that you put in your home, but getting a real tree involves the choosing, the hunting for it, the family outing. It really is a memory maker, it’s a day you spend together, and it really becomes much bigger than the tree itself,” Gray said. “It’s really making family memories and people really seem to gravitate to that right now.”
 The growing interest in real trees comes after the industry has struggled to attract new, younger customers in recent years as more Americans buy artificial trees.

It’s not like college when you can have a redshirt year or are on an athletic scholarship. For some, this is it. This may be the last time these student athletes will be able to compete and build relationships with their peers.
 As someone who played a sport in high school, some of my fondest memories came during practices, the jokes with my teammates, that indescribable feeling of competition and wanting to win. Honestly, this is what I probably reflect on the most when looking back on those days. There are so many life lessons that sports bring. It’s hard to describe, but it’s completely true.
 As long as things were done safely, which I believe they were, the fall season was a success - perhaps just for giving the kids a chance.
 Some teams were luckier than others. You had certain teams playing half of their scheduled games, while others were able to play everything, or close to it. That was the just how the cards played out this season.
 The cliché of playing each game like your last meant so much more this year. It was true. You never knew when the season could be taken away from you.
 Everyone worked together to achieve the goal of having a season. Whether it was playing for a championship or not, the high school kids can look back years from now and remember they were given the opportunity to compete and build memories with their teammates.
 We don’t know what the next few weeks or months will look like. It’s all up in the air.
 If we learned anything from the fall season, however, is that it can be done.
 This year is not so much about wins and losses. Teams and players are still trying to win and have their undefeated seasons - don’t get me wrong.
 But having spoken to a number of coaches, I can tell they are just happy to be out there. After a year filled with so much negativity, so much heartbreak, so much hardship, these memories matter. We need things to be positive about, to look forward to. That is so important right now.
 We have learned a lot through this pandemic. We learned to not take as much for granted. That lesson can be applied to this high school sports year.
 Ultimately, the fall sports season achieved its goal of simply having a safe season.
 And that’s what matters most.
