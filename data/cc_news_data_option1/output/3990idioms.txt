  President Muhammadu Buhari on Thursday received in audience at the State House, Abuja, the newly re-elected President of African Development Bank (AfDB), Dr Akinwumi Adesina.


  The President congratulated the AFDB boss on his second election, noting that "Nothing succeeds like success."


  Dr Adesina had overcome stiff opposition last month to win an unprecedented 100% votes from the regionals and non-regionals that make up the Bank and was inaugurated for a second term of five years as the AfDB President on September 1.


  "I have told so many people why I backed you," President Buhari said.


  "In 2015, during your first term, you were a Minister with the People's Democratic Party (PDP) government, and I was of the All Progressives Congress (APC). But you are a good Nigerian. So I recommended you the first time. You proved to be competent, you made us proud, and I recommended you the second time."


  The President commended Dr Adesina for his support for Africa in general, and Nigeria in particular, stressing that the infrastructural deficits the country has in roads, rail, power, could not be overcome without support.


  "There can't be sustainable development without infrastructure. Our efforts should be seen in the context of lack of resources, but you do your best to support us. I wish you all the best in your final term," President Buhari said.


  The AfDB President thanked the Nigerian President and people for their support, saying he was proud to be a citizen of the country.


  "Home is where dreams are born. Home is where nurturing is provided. It is where support is given for the realization of dreams. I am glad to belong here," Dr Adesina said.


  "When I came in June, you received me, and I shared my successes, and the difficulties facing me. You listened and said you would stand by me. And you did. You not only stood behind me but also beside me. No greater honour for a man than for his Commander-in-Chief to be his Supporter-in-Chief, and his Defender-in-Chief," he added.


  Adesina said Nigeria gave him air, "when I badly needed it in my lungs," and pledged to always support the country in his private capacity, and as AfDB President.

The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Monday carried out simultaneous raids across the country against Karnataka Congress leader DK Shivakumar and his brother DK Suresh, alleging that they had amassed disproportionate assets (DA) worth Rs 74.93 crore, people familiar with the development said.


  The agency has alleged that while serving as a cabinet minister in Karnataka, between April 1, 2013 and April 30, 2018 - when Shivakumar held the portfolio of state energy minister his family members amassed illegal wealth to the tune of Rs 74 crore, which is 44.93% of their total income during this period.


  The CBI acted against Shivakumar on the basis of a sanction accorded to it by the Karnataka government on September 25, 2019 after the Enforcement Directorate (ED), during a money laundering probe, found that there is scope for an investigation under the Prevention of Corruption Act.


  After the state government gave a go-ahead to the CBI to investigate Shivakumar, the Centre too asked the agency to probe his role and others in February this year. The CBI filed a preliminary enquiry (PE) - a precursor to the FIR - in March this year, which, prime facie, revealed that DK Shivakumar amassed the ill-gotten wealth in his name and in the name of his family members.


   


   


  CBI spokesperson RK Gaur said that raids were conducted at 14 locations - including Karnataka, Delhi, Mumbai and at the premises of Shivakumar and others which led to recovery of Rs 57 lakh cash and several incriminating property documents, bank related information, computer hard disk, etc.


  Officials said that the searches started at 6 am at their residence located in Doddallahalli village in Kanakapura constituency, which is represented by Shivakumar in the state assembly. DK Suresh represents Bengaluru Rural in the Lok Sabha.


  According to the CBI FIR, reviewed by HT, preliminary inquiry revealed that Shivakumar and his family members had moveable and immovable assets worth Rs 33.92 crore before April 2013, according to his 2013 election affidavit. Between April 2013 and April 2018, the Congress leader and his family members acquired assets, movable and immovable to the tune of Rs 128 crore and the total value of the assets held by them at the end of the said period was at Rs 162 crore, said the CBI FIR.


  The FIR adds that their total income and receipts during these five years was Rs 166 crore while their total expenditure was Rs 113 crore. "Therefore, they are found to be in possession of assets disproportionate to the tune of Rs 74.93 crore which is 44.93% of their total income and the same cannot be satisfactorily explained by the accused," the FIR adds.


  Congress instantly condemned the raids, calling it a political vendetta and an "insidious game of intimidation".


  "The insidious game of intimidation & machinations of Modi-Yeddyurappa duo being executed by a puppet CBI by raiding @DKShivakumar won't deter us. CBI should be unearthing the layers of corruption in Yeddyurappa Govt. But, 'Raid Raj' is their only 'Machiavellian Move'!" Randeep Singh Surjewala, the Congress' national spokesperson, tweeted.


  "Let Modi & Yeddyurappa Govts & BJP's frontal organizations i.e CBI-ED-Income Tax know that Congress workers & leaders will not be cowed down nor bow down before such devious attempts. Our resolve to fight for people & expose BJP's maladministration only becomes stronger," he added.


  Shivakumar was arrested on September 23 last year by the ED. He is currently out on bail.

When he retreated to his corner to sit on his stool during the break between rounds, however, broadcast cameras showed that the punch had knocked his nose out of shape.


  Rather than leaving his nose out of place, McGee attempted to reset it himself. "I set it moments after this in the 2nd. I felt that it was crooked after I stood up," he tweeted after the fight alongside a picture of his displaced nose.


  McGee overcame the injury to fight for another 10 minutes, though he lost a unanimous decision to Condit with scores of 30-27 across the board.


  Regardless, Condit was amazed at his opponent's heart, ability to withstand punishment, and repair his wounds on the fly.

Sevilla's energetic defending ensured Ronald Koeman's Barcelona dropped its first points in the Spanish league on Sunday. While Sevilla held Barcelona to a 1-1 draw at Camp Nou, Real Madrid went to the top of the standings after Vinicius Junior and goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois helped earn a 2-0 victory at Levante.Barcelona and Sevilla have a game in hand and trail Madrid by three points.Challenging Barcelona and defending champions Madrid for the title is not out of the question for Julen Lopetegui's well- disciplined Sevilla after this performance. A pressure defense anchored by Fernando and Jules Kounde shut down Lionel Messi for long periods and forced Barcelona into making an unusual number of bad passes."Getting a point at this ground is always tough, (but) I am not satisfied. We had our chances. It is too bad we couldn't have gotten a better result," Lopetegui said. "We had a game plan and wanted to carry it out."LOPETEGUI'S PLANSevilla's intense pressure up the pitch made Barcelona work extra hard to just get the ball past midfield. Very often, it didn't make it, losing possession in uncharacteristic fashion for a squad that prides itself on quality passing.Striker Luuk de Jong put Sevilla ahead in the eighth minute when he blasted home a loose ball that fell to him in the heart of the box after a corner.Barcelona hit back two minutes later when Messi drifted back into midfield and lobbed forward a pass to meet Jordi Alba's run from the left side. Jesus Navas tried to intercept the pass, only to knock it into the path of Coutinho who fired home.Lopetegui, the coach who was fired from both Spain and Real Madrid in 2018, has resurrected his career in Seville. His team hasn't lost in 18 straight league games going back to the last campaign, when it won the Europa League title.He lost his job at Madrid after a humbling 5-1 defeat at Camp Nou in 2018 and his Sevilla team lost 4-0 here last season.This time, a possible win was inches away when Barcelona defender Ronald Araujo deflected a dangerous cross off the bar of his own goal in the 64th.American Sergiño Dest made his debut for Barcelona when he replaced left back Jordi Alba.Barcelona had won all its matches -- including three preseason games -- since Koeman took over following its humiliating 8-2 defeat to Bayern Munich in the final game of last season."We lost more balls than we usually do ... but one week, three matches, and seven points, we have to be happy," Koeman said about his team's start.COURTOIS' FOOTFor a second straight game, Vinicius once again led his team in attack. Courtois protected the advantage when Levante pushed for an equalizer before Karim Benzema scored Madrid's second goal on the final kick of the match.Vinicius showed some fine finishing when he curled a right-footed shot inside the far post in the 16th minute. Later, he missed two clear chances to put the result beyond doubt.Courtois made an excellent save in the second half when he used his foot to parry a deflected shot that caught him falling the wrong way."(Courtois) saved us, but just like any goalkeeper that's what he does," Madrid coach Zinedine Zidane said.OTHER MATCHESRodrigo Ely's goal gave Alaves its first win, a 1-0 victory over Athletic Bilbao, which has gone scoreless in three of four matches.Cadiz extended its promising return to the top flight by coming back for a 1-1 draw with Granada.Osasuna bounced back from two losses by beating Celta Vigo 2-0 at home.
