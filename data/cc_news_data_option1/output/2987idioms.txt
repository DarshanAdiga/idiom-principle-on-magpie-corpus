When getting up to speed on the company’s ongoing projects, Jeffrey Katzenberg was shown the current version of _The Black Cauldron_ , and he, by all reports, hated it. He thought it was much too dark and scary, and that it would frighten children. Katzenberg wanted the really scary parts cut from the film, and due to the fact that he was new to Disney and had no history in animation, he didn’t understand the process. He reportedly clashed with animators who tried to explain that you couldn’t just edit animation the way you do live action. Katzenberg was willing to do it himself.
