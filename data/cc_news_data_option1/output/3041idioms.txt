CAMBRIDGE - The death of Eurie Stamps at the hands of a Framingham police officer in January 2011 was no accident, declared a longtime friend of Stamps and a former police officer.
 "That wasn't an accidental shooting," said former Cambridge police officer Larry Stead, addressing a crowd of more than 100 people participating in a #JusticeForEurie rally Saturday afternoon at Hoyt Field, near where Stamps grew up. "(Officers) are told to keep the finger outside the trigger. That cop had his finger on the trigger."
 Stamps, a retired MBTA maintenance worker and grandfather of 15, played basketball with the neighborhood kids at Hoyt Field. The basketball court will soon be named for him, along with the city's summer league.
 "All I'm saying is, that cop shouldn't be working," said Stead.
 Cries of "Eurie Stamps" and "No justice, no peace" echoed through the streets of Cambridge on Saturday. A banner with Stamps' smiling face, gray beard and white hat was carried by friends and family as they were escorted from City Hall to Hoyt Field by city police.
 Ralliers traveled about a mile in the 90-degree heat, many wearing black shirts with Stamps' face emblazoned on them. The shirts were designed by Ashley Harding, who helped reignite the fire behind Stamps' case with her husband, Laroy. They each grew up with Stamps and his son, Eurie Jr.
 On Jan. 5, 2011, two-and-a-half years before the Black Lives Matter movement was founded, Stamps was fatally shot in the head by Framingham police officer Paul Duncan after the department's SWAT team entered Stamps' 26 Fountain St. apartment during a drug raid. Police were investigating Stamps' stepson, Joseph Bushfan, and another man for allegedly selling crack cocaine from inside the home.
    Remembering Eurie Stamps, a Black man from Framingham killed by police  
 After Stamps, 68, complied with police orders and lay down on his stomach with his hands behind his back, Duncan shot him in the head with an M4 rifle after allegedly losing his balance. Later that year, the District Attorney's Office ruled the shooting accidental, causing Stamps' wife, Norma, and his son to sue Duncan and the town in 2012.
 In 2014, U.S. District Judge F. Dennis Saylor found in the town's favor on several counts, but refused to drop the civil rights claims, writing that Duncan may have violated constitutional protections by disengaging the safety on his rifle and pointing the weapon at Stamps' head.
 "While (Duncan) was standing there, he said he tripped, he said he fell and Eurie died," said Donnie Harding, who met Stamps when he was teenager. "When they did the autopsy… the bullet was lodged in his chest. The bullet went through his head, through his throat and ended up in his chest. That does not sound like an accident."
 Duncan remains on the city's police force.

 "It was a dark day when that police officer in Framingham took Eurie from us," said Cambridge City Councilor and former Mayor Denise Simmons. "And they said it was an accident. Now, we know, you know, and guess what, (Duncan) knows, it was no accident."
 The family received $3.75 million to settle its lawsuit against Framingham in 2016, but family and friends now want Stamps' name and case to ring not just through the streets of his home city, but nationally, just like those of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Eric Garner and other Black people who were killed by law enforcement officers.

 A group called #JusticeForEurie is aiming to make that happen.
 "I truly feel and relate to those families and those victims," Moriah Wilkins, one of Stamps' 15 grandchildren, told the Daily News on Saturday. "It just can't be swept under the rug, period."
 Wilkins, a Howard University graduate and owner of Rooted Essence: Dance & Healing Arts in Springfield, said her grandfather would always tell me to use her voice.
 "He empowered me," she said. "He was truly the wind beneath my wings, pushing me to that finish line. He always told me, 'Go ahead, baby, do it,' and whenever I felt my mom didn't understand me or my dad didn't understand me, my grandfather did."
 "While he was here, he meant something to the city," said Donnie Harding, recalling how Stamps often played basketball with Harding and other neighborhood youths in Cambridge. "The one thing that Eurie did when he came was he brought narrative to the game. He brought comic relief to the game."
 Boston resident Selvin Chambers knew Stamps his entire life. In fact, Stamps knew him before Chambers knew himself, he joked to the Daily News.
 "Whenever he was around, I felt two things - first thing I felt was that I was safe, because he was 6-foot-5 and weighed about 260 (pounds)," Chambers told ralliers on Saturday about growing up in the same housing development as Stamps. "The other thing I always felt when he was around, was that I was in check… it was about how he talked and what he said to you. He always had a kind thing to say to you, but when you went off the drifted path, Eurie was going to let you know."

And why is Britain allowing the bodies of unknown Chinese citizens – who may have been victims of torture, human rights violations, persecution or organ theft – to be turned into a travelling circus? This has echoes of necromancy and body snatching. Our bodies are sacred vessels and even in death should be treated with respect and human dignity. Not to speak out and turn the spotlight on this issue would be a further betrayal of those whose bodies were so badly served in life and are now being denigrated in death.
