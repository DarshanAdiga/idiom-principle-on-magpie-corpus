Governments and regulators have become increasingly observant of companies’ female representation. For example, California's law mandates certain publicly traded companies to include women on their boards. This would more than double the total number of female-occupied board seats in the state, per S&P Global. Other U.S. state governments, including New Jersey, Illinois, and Massachusetts, have taken efforts to announce similar legislation related to gender diversity on boards of directors.

Considering BMW's plans, that means a whole bunch of cars could be running eDrive Zones in the future. Right now, BMW Group (including Mini) offers 14 different electrified vehicles, with that number set to grow to 25 by the end of 2023, a majority of which will be pure battery-electric models. Of course, eDrive Zones won't mean much when a car is running on electricity literally all the time, but for European plug-in hybrids, it'll be an important little piece of kit.
 While the program is currently only running in these two locations, it will likely expand in the future. In fact, Birmingham's low-emission zone isn't even up and running yet, with an implementation due in 2021. Other European cities have looked at similar measures for reducing overall emissions in tightly packed areas, which will benefit not only the air quality, but the resulting health of those living in and commuting through these areas. As more zones get implemented, it's likely that BMW will continue to expand its eDrive Zones to match.

At least 14 people were killed and 15 others were seriously injured Friday when an Indian passenger jet skidded off the runway after landing in heavy rain, officials said.
 Air India Express said more than 190 passengers and crew were on board the plane, which left from Dubai and landed at Kozhikode airport in the southern state of Kerala.
 Television pictures showed part of the fuselage of the jet ripped apart, although there was no sign of any fire.
 "I can confirm at least 14 deaths overall. Another 15 passengers have critical injuries. It is still a developing situation," senior local policeman Abdul Karim told AFP.
 "We have at least 89 people, many of them with serious injuries, admitted at different Kozhikode hospitals. The ambulances are still coming in," said Sujith Das, another senior police official.
 "We have been told that all those who have survived the crash also have some form of injuries."
 One of those killed was one of the two pilots, a Kerala state deputy said.
 Aviation regulator DGCA said the plane skidded off the end of the runway and "fell down in the valley and broke down in two pieces".
 An Air India Express spokesperson said the aircraft appeared to have overshot the runway.
 One television channel reported there had been a problem with the jet's landing gear.
 Air India Express said in a statement that there was "no fire reported at the time of landing."
 It said there were 174 passengers, 10 infants, two pilots and five cabin crew on board the aircraft.
 "As per the initial reports, rescue operations are on and passengers are being taken to hospital for medical care," it said.
 An emergency services official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told AFP: "Rescue operations are on but the rains are making it difficult."
 Television pictures showed emergency services personnel working in the dark and spraying the wreckage with water.
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted his condolences.
 "My thoughts are with those who lost their loved ones. May the injured recover at the earliest... Authorities are at the spot, providing all assistance to the affected," Modi said.
 The last major plane crash in India was in 2010 when an Air India Express Boeing 737-800 from Dubai to Mangalore overshot the runway and burst into flames.
 The crash killed 158 people and left eight survivors.
 Kerala has been battered by heavy rains in recent days.
 At least 15 people were killed on Friday after a landslide triggered by heavy rains flattened a row of huts elsewhere in the state.
 Around 50 other people were feared trapped in the debris. The dead included two children.

My first kitchen job involved making six gallons of gazpacho every Sunday. This was back when earning your chops meant something, and making that whole batch with just a knife and peeler, no blender, was the most tedious task on my list. It was also the most popular dish on the menu. By the time I'd learned that recipe -- straight out of the "Moosewood Cookbook" -- by heart, I figured I knew everything there was to know about cold Spanish soups.      When I finally made it to Spain, reality set in on many levels. Sangria, it turns out, is just for tourists, while the locals drink a mix of red wine and Sprite called tinto de verano.      Spanish gazpacho, meanwhile, is a lot smoother than my chunky hippie version. And because it's so involved to make, with an entire garden's worth of vegetables to prepare, gazpacho is often reserved for special occasions like Sundays or when company comes over. When the average Spaniard wants to whip up a quick cold soup at home, or have a chilled bowl at the local bar, it's much more likely to be salmorejo.   Just tomatoes, garlic, oil, vinegar, salt and bread crumbs, a much pared-down cast compared to gazpacho, in salmorejo we are free to focus all of our attention on the tomato.      It has a creamy red look, and a body that jiggles like sea foam thanks to the emulsion among tomato, oil and vinegar, and thickened by the tomato-soaked bread. Some recipes call for the "guts" of a baguette; I've also had good luck cutting the edges off a slice of bread -- usually white but whole grain adds a fun heartiness once in a while.      High-acid, normal-looking red tomatoes are traditionally used, but some of my best batches have been mutts, medleys of whatever heirlooms, slicers, cherry and paste tomatoes are getting too soft for salad.      I was in Spain when COVID-19 hit. On the last afternoon before the lockdown, it didn't quite seem real. In Lanjaron, a cute mountain village in Andalusia, it was business and leisure as usual. As my kids enjoyed a playground that would be roped off for months the very next morning, I ducked into a cafe just ahead of a tour bus from Madrid, and ordered a bowl of salmorejo. It came out immediately, garnished with chopped hard boiled egg and jamon -- Spanish cured ham.      I didn't realize it at the time, but that typical bowl of everyday salmorejo would be my last taste of normalcy for months, not to mention my last restaurant meal. Cooped in our rented house during the lockdown, I began to understand the wisdom of keeping a pitcher of salmorejo in the fridge. It was as much an act of preparation for the inevitable heat of the day as a response to the ever-accumulating soft tomatoes and stale bread, one problem solving another.      Here is a boilerplate salmorejo recipe. Tweak it to suit your own whims and tastes -- but only adjust the levels of the called-for ingredients. If you start adding things, you'll have bready gazpacho in no time.      Salmorejo   Serves 4   • 2 pounds tomatoes   • 1/2 cup "bread guts" -- roughly a slice of bread with the crust cut off   • 1 modest sized clove garlic, chopped   • 2 teaspoons sherry vinegar (more to taste if your tomatoes are low-acid)   • ½ teaspoon salt + more to taste   • ½ cup extra virgin olive oil   • Garnish: hard boiled egg, chopped ham, olive oil, parsley, chives      Boil a pot of salted water deep enough to submerge your tomatoes.      While the water heats, cut a cross into the bottom of each tomato to slice the skins. Then chop the bread.      Boil the tomatoes in the water for about 2 minutes, then immediately plunge them into an ice bath until they are completely cool. Remove the tomatoes and pull off the skins. If you want to go the extra mile, cut open the tomatoes and remove the seeds. (And if you want to slack, you can skip peeling the tomatoes).      Liquify the tomatoes in a blender for about 30 seconds. Add the bread and liquify again. Let the blended bread sit for about 5 minutes in the blended tomatoes.      Add the garlic, salt, vinegar and oil. Blend on high for a minute. Check seasonings; blend again if you made any adjustments.      Chill. Garnish with chopped hard boiled egg and jamon if you want to be traditional. More casually, a simple splash of olive oil or sprinkle of fresh parsley will complete the dish.

A rebel armed ethnic group is capitalizing of the coronavirus pandemic to obtain cash from Kachin businesspeople in Myanmar's far north, putting an unnecessary monetary problem on residents who currently are having a hard time to make ends satisfy, homeowners stated Thursday.
 The Kachin Independence Army (KIA) has actually enforced a “tax” on store owners and jade traders, according to numerous homeowners who talked to RFA's Myanmar Service on condition of privacy out of issue for their security.
 Kachin soldiers make the owners of little and medium-size stores pay 400,000 to 1 million kyats (U.S. $290-$726), however have actually required in between 1 million and 2 million kyats from owners of big shops, stated one homeowner. They gather about 50,000 kyats from managers in the jade-trading company in the state, house to Hpakant, the world's biggest jadeite mine.
 “During the COVID pandemic, many shops are closed,” the homeowner stated. "The entry to the Hpakant location is closed. The Union federal government has actually reduced taxes for bad individuals. They [KIA soldiers] must stop gathering ‘tax’ in the location."

In your overwrought response you ignore the point of the piece entirely and do not challenge a single statement of fact as presented in the article, and there are a lot of them about the people that the article is actually about, people that are not Biden. Your main point about the article itself which you think is significant is that the couple million for a book and $540,000 a year for a non-job is just trivial bucks in the world where Biden operates. That is true enough but in making the only pertinent part of your rant be about how Biden got his money fair and square you are defending a charge that was not made.

The joint sitting of Parliament on Thursday night passed the Mutual Legal Assistance (Criminal Matters) Bill 2020 only after two days of consultations between government and opposition. With this, the third of the eight acts the Financial Action Task Force wants Pakistan to pass, if it is to comply with the FATF Action Plan, has become a law and the laws are finally beginning to cut close to the bone, as the new statute provides for Pakistan to provide mutual assistance to other countries for criminals, including handing them over, even if there is no mutual extradition agreement. One of the concerns of the opposition, which insisted on having over two dozen amendments it proposed being included, was that the Act should not be misused, either by foreign powers, or the home governments, to obtain the handover of Pakistani citizens without reason. Religious parties were also against the bill, because those religious leaders who accepted donations from abroad could well fall within the mischief of the bill.
