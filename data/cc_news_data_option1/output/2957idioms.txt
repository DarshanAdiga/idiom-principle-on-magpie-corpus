The head of the trade union Unite has warned British Airways that it plans to move towards industrial action against the airline "with immediate effect".
 Unite and BA have been at loggerheads for several weeks. In April, BA owner IAG warned it could cut up to 12,000 jobs due to the impact of coronavirus.
 Staff were warned that if agreement was not reached, they would be handed their notice and re-hired on new contracts.
 BA said it was disappointed by Unite's criticism.
 ## 'Fire and rehire'
 For many long-serving staff, BA's plan would involve significant pay cuts, as well as changes to terms and conditions.

As many people lost their jobs, some turned to Amazon, eBay and other internet sales platforms to become a vendor or third-party reseller and try to make some extra money.
   
 For many years I have heard stories about Amazon competing with its third- party resellers. I decided to look into this practice and report my findings to you.
   
 I posted the question on Google, "Why does Amazon compete against its resellers?" Here is what I found. The comments are enlightening.
   
 Yes, Amazon is indeed the 700-pound gorilla in the room. Amazon has many divisions. I decided to focus on the division where Amazon provides the fulfillment/product delivery to the buyer. Here is information on the popular Amazon FBA.
   
 Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) -- Amazon has one of the most advanced fulfillment networks in the world. With Amazon FBA, you store your products in Amazon's fulfillment centers, and Amazon picks, packs, ships, and provides customer service for these products. According to an anonymous reseller, Amazon's take is as much as a third of the profit. And, if your products are selling extremely well, Amazon may become your biggest competitor. This doesn't sound fair, does it?
   
 There have been many books published about how to succeed with Amazon as a partner, associate or reseller.
   
 I found an interesting string and thought that the comments made by individuals working with Amazon were enlightening. Many folks openly shared their experiences, frustrations and disappointments. Here are some of their comments. I hope you find them as interesting as I did.
   
 "I was told for many months, that Amazon does not buy merchandise from manufacturers and sells it for its own profit - that its business model was not to own property but to allow its affiliate sellers to manage the property, whether shipping by the seller or seller fulfilling the merchandise at Amazon locations. I'm disappointed to find out that Amazon is in fact competing with me. Amazon is buying from the same manufacturer-source that I am and is selling it ahead of me. I figured that Amazon would do this without telling me, because after all, we're all in it for the mighty buck and business relationships especially formed online, are easily broken. I'm real disappointed and will take down my merchandise, inventory list, and as soon as my FBA Amazons are sold off, I'm closing my account. I don't need this." -- National_Cartridge_C
   
 "Most sellers (myself included) compete with Amazon. It is not usually fair competition, since it is their marketplace, but you can be successful. Amazon does not have unlimited access to everything. They do not know every product. They cannot afford to buy everything.
   
 As a result, there are gaps, primarily due to Amazon selling out and being unable to restock the items. That means that you might need to wait a bit longer to sell your items at a reasonable price, but for most products, you will still get your chance.
   
 There may also be some items that Amazon has not yet discovered or has not yet purchased that you can sell for a while. Also, be aware that Amazon has more customers than other sales channels. If you choose to give up on it, you are really only hurting yourself." -- Boardgames4Us
   
 "It could be that your Manufacturer is selling direct to Amazon through vendor central. Ultimately it is your manufacturer/supplier who makes the call whether or not they want to deal with Amazon. I wouldn't put the blame on Amazon, it is more about whether your supplier values your business more or Amazon's." -- zzzzzzz
   
 "Amazon uses yours and everybody else's sales history to find new items for them to stock. If they see an item selling like hot cakes, you best believe they have a team that will find the manufacturer of that item, order a large quantity and then sell it at retail or often less than retail prices.
   
 You have to find products that Amazon won't be able to get its hands on or create allowed bundles of popular products. I've never seen Amazon jump on bundle listings even if they sell both items being bundled." -- TQP
   
 "With all the data they have on products and how many they sell, they will approach the manufacturer for a deal.
   
 Personally, we have dropped some lines of merchandise for just this reason. We can't compete on price in our retail stores. However, in the long run, it hurts the manufacturer. Over time they start to have their long-time clients, like us, quit buying.
   
 We know manufacturers and distributors who will not sell to Amazon. They know what will happen to their company.
   
 The world of selling is changing, attend a trade show in the areas in which you sell, and you'll learn a lot." -- SELLC
   
 "Amazon has details about every transaction and product on the marketplace that allows them to mine that data to determine what products are working. They might not know the costs, initially, but they can derive that from the pricing and they often can determine the suppliers.
   
 It is not much of a stretch and you will find on these forums enough anecdotal evidence of sellers who have been nearly exclusive and then Amazon got in the game.
   
 And, I personally know that my suppliers have been contacted by Amazon and those suppliers have started selling to them.
   
 This is really not a secret, but a fact of life. You just need to adjust to that and get on with the game." -- Boardgames4Us
   
 "It's a well-publicized fact that Amazon uses its 3p sellers to do merchandise research. If an item sold only by a 3p seller sells well, Amazon attempts to sell it also. Welcome to selling on Amazon." -- The_Lunatick_Fire_an
   
 Very interesting! I have one client who is making almost one million dollars annually with Amazon FBA. Amazon makes the rules, can and does change them whenever they desire. Be careful if you dare to play with this 700-pound gorilla from the Amazon. It is indeed a jungle out there.
