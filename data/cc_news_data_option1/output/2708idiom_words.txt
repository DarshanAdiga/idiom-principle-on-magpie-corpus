Bitcoin Futures opened up the investment potential for large investors and institutions - the big players who wanted a suite of tools to make the most out of the asset class.

The latter wanted margin trading, leverage, and short selling.

Futures opened the floodgates of institutional investors, boosting liquidity and, more importantly, adding a sense of legitimacy to the overall cryptocurrency market. Futures contracts are also required to comply with regulations put down by the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), which further assuages any concerns about risk and legitimacy that professional investors may have. This, in turn, has spurred exchanges to offer specialized custody solutions so that traditional investors can invest in the crypto market even outside of derivative products such as futures.


--DocBreak--
In between the floor and ceiling, the actual stop is based on recent volatility, which is also comforting to know.     


--DocBreak--
Similarly, dollar stops can get you into trouble, too.  What might be a realistic, reasonable dollar stop for you (say $500) might be totally unrealistic for the market you are trading.  The random noise in the market might take you out very quickly!     


--DocBreak--
Test!  Run the ATR stop with the dollar floor and ceiling. You’ll get good performance usually, comparable to dollar stops or ATR stops alone.  Plus, you’ll protect yourself from extreme stops that ATRs alone occasionally produce.

 "Our office doesn't object to any of these ideas - they are all undeniably critical to building a more just and equitable city," Durkan's spokeswoman Kelsey Nyland said. "But each … is much more nuanced than it initially might seem, and if we don't factor that into our discussions … then we'll never be able to build actionable and lasting solutions."
 Council members are also discussing calls to cut the police department's remaining budget. Durkan previously pushed for cutting about $20 million from the department amid a larger plan.

I’ll try 3 values of stop loss: $500, $1250 and $2000.  These values are pretty reasonable for many markets.  For reporting purposes, I’ll average the resulting profit factors together, rather than pick an optimized result.

--DocBreak--
The ATR Stop beats the Dollar Stop 66% of the time, although many of the resulting profit factors are extremely similar to each other.

And with the ceiling, I like knowing my max loss is basically capped (ignoring excessive stop slippage) at a value I choose.
