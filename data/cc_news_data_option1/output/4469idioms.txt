The man who masterminded an $800 million insurance scam that fleeced tens of thousands of investors in one of Florida's all-time largest fraud schemes was sentenced Friday to 20 years in prison.
 U.S. District Judge Robert Scola gave Joel Steinger, 64, credit for pleading guilty to avoid a lengthy and costly trial and said Steinger's multiple medical problems — he appeared in court in a wheelchair, with an oxygen tank — argued against the maximum 50-year sentence sought by prosecutors.
 But Scola said Steinger still deserved a lengthy prison term because, as chief executive of now-defunct Mutual Benefits Corp., he orchestrated a fraud scheme that victimized more than 30,000 investors in all 50 states and numerous foreign countries between 1994 and 2004.
 "My understanding is that most of the time, on the major decisions, it was you making the decisions," Scola said. "It's clear that you were the mastermind of the criminal enterprise."
 The company, first investigated in 2003 by the state Office of Insurance Regulation, bought life insurance policies from people with AIDS, cancer and other chronic illnesses and sold them to investors. The policyholder would get paid an upfront, discounted amount and the investor was promised a larger insurance payout when the person died.
 The company promised safety and sky-high returns. But Steinger and others involved in the scam admitted that life expectancy numbers were cooked, the company's financial strength was falsified and eventually older investors were being paid with money from newer ones in classic Ponzi scheme fashion. Mutual Benefits was shut down by the Securities and Exchange Commission in 2004.
 Assistant U.S. Attorney Karen Rochlin argued for the longest possible sentence, comparing Steinger to convicted Ponzi schemers Bernard Madoff and Scott Rothstein, the former South Florida attorney who is serving a 50-year sentence for running a $1.2 billion scam involving investments in fake legal settlements.
 "There should be no others like him ever again," Rochlin said of Steinger.
 From his wheelchair, Steinger delivered a rambling 40-minute monologue repeating his many health issues and apologizing for hurting investors and his own employees.
 "It eats my guts out that this turned into a criminal enterprise, that people got hurt," he said. "Nobody intended this to end up the way it did, least of all me."
 Steinger is the last of 13 defendants convicted in the case, including his brother Steven Steiner who is serving 15 years behind bars. The brothers spell their last names differently.
 Part of Friday's hearing concerned Steinger's 2007 assistance to the FBI in an offshoot case involving Dr. Alan Mendelsohn, a Fort Lauderdale eye doctor who was seeking campaign contributions to wield influence among state leaders in Tallahassee. Steinger wore a recording device in conversations in which Mendelsohn falsely claimed he had enough clout to make criminal investigations into Steinger's business disappear.
 Mendelsohn eventually pleaded guilty in a federal corruption case and was sentenced to four years in prison.
 Steinger got little credit in his own sentencing for his cooperation because, as Rochlin put it, he only turned to the FBI about Mendelsohn when investigators were closing in on his own fraud scheme and he didn't help them uncover the truth behind Mutual Benefits.
 "It was too little, too late," she said.

In the longer term, however, the trends seem to be working against Facebook. A history of acquiring upstart rivals and folding them into the Facebook family (or simply copying their business, a la Snapchat) means that it's unlikely the company will let any newcomers sneak up on it. But Big Tech rivals like Alphabet with YouTube and Amazon.com ( AMZN) with Twitch continue to attract large, young audiences that Facebook can't ignore. It also seems less and less likely that lawmakers will ignore Facebook's antics, and only time will tell if they bring the hammer down on the world's largest social media company.

Total third-quarter production volumes were 207,700 barrels of oil equivalents per day (Mboe/d), up 20% year over year. Liquids volumes accounted for nearly 78.3% of total production, reflecting the company’s increased focus on oil.      Quarterly oil production was 122.3 thousand barrels per day (Mbbl/d), nearly 13% higher than the year-ago level, courtesy of 51% volume growth in the Delaware basin over the past 12 months on the back of solid contribution from the acquired Felix Energy.      Total costs and expenses were $587 million, up 6.1% from $553 million in the year-ago quarter. Interest expenses for the reported quarter were $48 million, up 26.3% from the year-ago figure.

The worst day of John Morgan's life was when his brother snapped his neck diving into a Walt Disney World lagoon while working as a lifeguard. It left him a quadriplegic.
 That day also set Morgan, the man behind Florida's medical marijuana ballot initiative, on a course that would make him a wealthy and locally famous personal injury lawyer.
 Morgan, then an undergraduate student, watched as Disney's lawyers successfully fought his brother at every turn. When the case eventually boiled down to a worker's compensation claim, even then the big corporation beat the little guy. Instead of settling, Disney said Tim Morgan could still work as a resort telephone operator on the graveyard shift.
 "It was like, 'We've crushed you.' I was so frustrated. I knew what I was going to do," Morgan said — he would get revenge against those who hurt his brother and those like them. "And I've never done anything else."
 That's not quite true. Since then he's also wielded a lot of political influence; started an investment firm with retired NBA star Grant Hill; opened a crime museum in Washington, D.C., with "America's Most Wanted" host John Walsh; built a string of science-themed attractions called Wonderworks; and spent $4 million to get the medical marijuana proposal on the November ballot — an issue also inspired by his brother Tim, who smokes pot to help control muscle spasms he still suffers from his diving injury.
 John Morgan, 58, began Morgan & Morgan in 1988 with three lawyers. It now has 260 lawyers in 23 offices across six states, built in part by being a pioneer among personal injury lawyers who advertise on television and billboards. His ads blanket the state.
 Morgan counts presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton among his friends and former Gov. Charlie Crist, who is again running for governor, is an employee. Morgan is a huge political donor who has raised millions of dollars for candidates — usually Democrats, but he's also written checks for Republicans.
 And his personality is as big as his law firm. He's charismatic with a sense of humor that's often sprinkled with profanity. He is not shy about his fondness for Tennessee whiskey, but after a 1997 DUI he said doesn't get behind the wheel if he has even a single drink. Instead he has a black limousine and a driver.
 Morgan doesn't hide his wealth, but he is generous with it. An Orlando food bank named its distribution center after his firm when he and his wife Ultima donated $2 million to the organization. He hands out large denomination bills when approached by the homeless and helps many others privately.
 He has a you-can't-take-it-with-you attitude about his millions. "I've been to a thousand funerals. I've never seen a U-Haul hooked up to a hearse," Morgan, holding a whiskey on the rocks, told the Tampa Bay Young Republicans this spring while talking about the marijuana initiative.
 The GOP group took some heat for inviting Morgan to the event. Executive director Lacey Wickline acknowledged that many Republicans don't like Morgan because of his political stances and unapologetic style. But Wickline said Morgan is a huge Florida employer and investor and simply a nice guy who likes to help people.
 "He's kind of like Bill Clinton in that he makes you feel like the most important person in the room. He just has that much charisma and I think it's absolutely genuine," she said. "He's worked his butt off. He's built this empire and I just admire that regardless of what we disagree on politically."
 Those fighting him on the medical marijuana issue aren't so positive about Morgan.
 "He's been very nasty and very unprofessional to the people debating him," said Calvina Fay, executive director of the Drug Free America Foundation.
 Morgan admits when challenged, he fights back hard.
 "When somebody comes looking for a fight, I will take out my right hand with an open palm and slap them down to the ground," he said.
 Morgan is the oldest of five children born to alcoholic parents. His father had a hard time holding a job and his mother was an angry drunk. He remembers at 14 driving and with no driver's license packing his siblings into a car and checking into a motel to escape her. He said looking back now, it's hard to imagine that was his life.
 "We were dealing with the hellcat," he said. "She was one of these that would wake up and just be coming at ya, belligerent as hell, just blind running drunk."
 So Morgan spent a lot of his time working.
 At 14 he was flipping burgers at a Dairy Queen. He said the job made him feel "sky high" and he liked the feeling of having money in his pocket.
 "I was like, 'Give me all the hours you want. I like being at work,'" Morgan said.
 In college he worked at Disney as a costumed character, beginning as the "The Jungle Book" orangutan King Louie and later portraying Fiddler Pig and finally Pluto.
 "Disney was a safe haven for me," he said. "I would have worked non-stop at Disney if they let me."
 And despite his feelings about Disney after his brother's accident, he holds no bitterness for the theme park giant.
 "I love Disney World," he said. "When I was a character, the reason it was such a great job is you're dealing with people who are really having one of the very best days they're ever going to have in their whole life and you're a part of it."
 And Walt Disney is one of the people who inspired him as he grew his businesses.
 "The mantra at Disney was dream and do it, and most people just dream but don't do. The reason that Walt Disney is one of my heroes is that guy did it," Morgan said. "That's kind of how I tick. I like a big project, I like a big challenge."

These numbers are all-important to Facebook's lifeblood: advertisers. Facebook relies on advertising for revenue, and to convince advertisers to spend money, Facebook must illustrate that it can continue to bring in new users and keep them on its platforms. In doing so, the company collects more data on those users, which it can then pass along to advertisers to help them target exactly which customers their ads will be most effective with. With its user count continuing to increase, Facebook is sitting pretty, but reliance on advertising can be a double-edged sword (more on that later).

We don't end up searching for Bobby, however. Beth is outlandishly captivating, and Taylor-Joy brings an often wordless, physical, yet transcendent style to the role that's equal measures intimidating and alluring, animated by a ferocious intelligence. As a competitor, Harmon is obsessed. So the second half of the series focuses on how her individual intensity is transformed into a team effort.
 This is where "The Queen's Gambit" nails big-time chess. There might be just two players at the board, but there are squads behind each side, and for the Soviets in the 1960s, that was a national advantage. All the finest players in the world worked together to elevate the finest among them, and in the series, Borgov doesn't spend time alone: he huddles with his seconds, plotting, and planning.
 Harmon is a one-woman army, at least chess-wise, until the final episodes (she receives considerable support, emotional and financial, from the best performer in the show, Moses Ingram as Beth's best friend from the orphanage, Jolene; Ingram steals every scene she's in).

Pro-Life advocates again asked to speak to the court Monday, after commissioners’ agenda said, “Clarify the court’s intent, re-vote, discuss and take appropriate action regarding the Pro-Life Resolution” previously considered Oct. 19. Kelly first said this was inappropriate and not county business, and told waiting speakers to talk to legislators. They stayed to speak anyway, to ask again that commissioners vote their official support.
 Discussion followed among commissioners that they legally passed it previously, a position supported by County Attorney Heather Stebbins who said it passed the first time and they should clarify that on the written court order. Kelly said it is a social issue, divisive for the community and asked the court to rescind the Oct. 19 vote.
 Jerry Wolfe quoted “Robert’s Rules of Order,” saying abstensions in that vote don’t count; and this question is non-political and transcends all other questions.
 Bill Morgan said a supporting resolution reflects a majority of county residents; and as the governing body, they should pass a supporting statement.
 Makenna Hall, 18, said she supports making Kerr County “a sanctuary for the unborn;” quoted statistics on abortions and called it “sickening;” and said this county is “overwhelmingly pro-life” and commissioners need to return to “the culture of life.”
 Thomas Jeffers, a pastor, said he wanted to change commissioners’ hearts and decision; and persuade them to pass a resolution “and save even one life.” He said the majority of citizens have been silent since the Roe-vs.-Wade decision.
 Kelly said he disagreed and thinks it ought to be fought out in Congress, that Commissioners’ Court has no jurisdiction.
 Fr. David Wagner said his Notre Dame Catholic Church parishioners asked him to speak, for public record; and quoted paragraphs of the Catholic Catechism.
 Nathaniel Hall compared the commissioners’ actions on COVID rules equivalent to making rules on this, too.
 Terry Hall quoted anti-abortion language in the Republican Party platform, saying that platform expects elected leaders to also uphold that. After comparing the work of the local Pregnancy Resource Center to Planned Parenthood’s, she said, “What you affirm will speak volumes, and we won’t forget.”
 Commissioners discussion followed, with Harley Belew saying it passed before; and Moser saying, at minimum it needs to reflect that; and he agrees it’s not county business and some Republicans don’t agree on this.
 Don Harris said one supporting vote in Kerr (a conservative county and area) could lead to other counties doing the same. Letz said he personally supports pro-life, and it passed before.
 Kelly then moved to vote again, to rescind the previous vote. That’s when Stebbins said it passed, before.
 The motion to rescind the first vote failed 3-2; and the speakers all applauded.
 E. Kerr Wastewater contracts
 At the recommendation of Kerr County Engineer Charlie Hastings, commissioners voted 5-0 to formally reject Contracts 2 and 3 for Phase 3 of the East Kerr County Center Point Wastewater Project.
 Hastings said a team has been working to find and certify low-income and moderate-income households in the project area to participate and be connected to the new wastewater services, as this project moved forward. He said on his local end, he did not schedule required advertising about bidding on contracts to be published in local papers on consecutive weeks, as instructed; but instead published those notices with two weeks between them.
 Hastings told commissioners the team can finish their work finding more households to sign on, and while that continues, he will publish again the bidding notices in proper timing. He has already talked to the company they picked from the first procedure, and that company is ready to bid again.
 After re-advertising for bidders, Hastings estimates opening bids Nov. 24; reading them in a court meeting Nov. 30; and notifying the chosen contractor about awarding the bid in early December.

An administration run by Joe Biden would have a mixed impact on oil markets, though it would likely result in lower oil prices over time, according to a new report by the research firm Rystad Energy.
 In the short term, Biden could give markets a boost, the group said in the Tuesday report. Assuming the Senate is also under Democratic control, Biden's likely to pass a massive stimulus package, ramping up energy consumption and lifting oil prices as a result.
 Down the road, however, his administration -- which is committed to supporting clean energy -- is likely to both constrict oil demand and increase supply, Rystad said. Ultimately, that's bad news for oil prices.
 "Although a Biden win could benefit short-term demand, his approach to foreign relations could bring more supply to the market, thus a conservative oil- friendly Trump win could be the most bullish immediate outcome for oil," the group said.
 Oil prices crashed this spring, as lockdowns tied to the spread of coronavirus caused fuel demand to plummet. While they've since gained some ground, crude prices are still down more than 40%. They've failed to gain ground recently as coronavirus cases mount around the world.
 "Above all, we expect the election to be a milestone, a sigh of relief, after which the oil market will reorient itself to the larger structural macro weakening and the increasing likelihood of a second, yet milder, wave of Covid-19 oil demand destruction," Bjornar Tonhaugen, an analyst at Rystad Energy, said in the Tuesday note.
 Here are three ways a Biden victory could boost oil markets -- and three threats his administration poses.

Lochel's cookie poll ends at 7 p.m. on Election Day, then they'll determine the final tally. But for now, she says Trump seems to be the clear winner.
 In Wisconsin -- yet another battleground state -- the cookie poll at Uncle Mike's Bake Shoppe also shows Trump poised for a landslide victory, leading Biden with 70.2% of cookie sales to 29.8% in the most recent update.
 Mike Vande Walle, owner of the bakery, has been running cookie polls every election since 2008 and said this year's results are unprecedented.
 "We've never seen anything like it," he told The New Yorker. "I don't know if they're buying the Trump ones as jokes. That's the only thing I can think of, because that's a big spread."
 However, the poll isn't always accurate. In 2012, Unlce Mike's sold more Mitt Romney cookies than Barack Obama cookies, yet Obama won the election. But in 2016, the poll accurately predicted Trump would take Wisconsin -- the first time the state went red in a presidential election since 1984, according to The New Yorker.
 Bobby Jucker, owner of Texas' Three Brothers Bakery, said the results aren't always what they seem.
 His bakery's cookie poll shows Trump leading Biden, but by a much narrower margin -- 2,183 to 1,586 as of Friday, according to a Facebook post.
 "This poll may be skewed because I've had customers come in to get Trump cookies so they can bite his head off," Jucker told KHOU.
 He said the bakery's been running its cookie poll for the last four elections and has accurately predicted the winner every time.
 But Jucker said the poll is all in good fun.
 "At the end of the day, it's a cookie, we're just trying to have fun with this really tough election," he told KHOU.

Effects Detail tricks you into thinking it doesn't offer much of a benefit to enhancing your frame rate when you're testing it, but that's because all the effects arrive in the midst of a fight, with grenade explosions and muzzle flashes and bullet tracers flying every which way. And these are the moments where you need your frame rate to be rock solid. So set this to Low if you can stomach it, and Medium if not.

Team Beth winds up being quite scrappy, as even high-grade US chess was in the 1960s. Her most daunting foes are, of course, the Soviets, whose Cold War chess was anything but rough around the edges. Few actual historical players are presented in the story, adapted from a 1983 novel by Walter Tevis. The reigning world champion is Vasily Borgov, a mashup of Spassky and Tigran Petrosian, with a sly touch of current world champ Magnus Carlsen thrown in (Borgov, like Carlsen, is described as a master of the endgame).
 But Beth confronts plenty of rivals, all-male, along the way. Two become boyfriends, and then coaches. That might sound offensive, but it adds some helpful romantic sizzle to the depiction of a world that was certainly sexy -- in a Gibsons-and-Chesterfields, Rat-Pack-in-Vegas, James-Bondish sort of way back when JFK and LBJ were in the White House -- but that was also, well, full of socially awkward young men playing chess.
 (A significant element, almost entirely omitted in the series, is that there was a women's pro chess tour in the 1950s and 1960s, too, with its own world champions, including five-time winner Nona Gaprindashvili, the only real-life player depicted in the series, and then only in a pan of an audience, with the voiceover acknowledgment that she had never faced the Soviet men.)

Trump has also pushed a plan to create 10 million new jobs in 10 months. Certainly, it's an ambitious goal that would need attention from day one. Along with that objective is a plan to create one million new small businesses over his next four years in office. Small businesses are the nation's top employer. The more new businesses his administration is able to get off the ground, the more jobs he'll be able to produce.
