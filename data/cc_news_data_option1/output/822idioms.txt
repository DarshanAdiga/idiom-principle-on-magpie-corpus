Some stress is good, even required to elicit activity. Too much stress is bad leading to feeling overwhelmed. Amy Arnsten, Neurobiology and Psychology Professor at Yale University, calls this the “Goldilocks of the brain.” Stress must be just right to achieve peak performance. This sweet spot is different for everyone, and even different in the same person over time and different based on the task being performed. We find ourselves in the zone when we achieve that perfect amount of stress.
 High stress over time can have a debilitating effect on the mind and body. The body reacts to a threatening situation, the flight or fight response. Blood pressure, heart rate, respiration and perspiration all increase. Blood-flow moves toward the extremities and blood becomes stickier. Inflammatory hormones are activated. All these physiological responses are intended to save you. However, when they don’t switch off or if the body is frequently in this stress state, it becomes unhealthy. Chronic stress is a risk factor for several chronic illnesses.
 Working memory is short-term memory used to work on the task at hand. Anxiety and pressure to perform reduces this capacity. The same parts of the brain are used for attention training through mindfulness. Allow time to become calm and focus on the activity to increase capacity. Today people pride themselves on multi-tasking. Multi-taskers are often on autopilot, toggling between tasks and not paying much attention to anything. Performance and enjoyment both suffer as a result.
 The mind tells the brain it’s stressed. It’s our perception that triggers these responses. Often, it’s our misperception that keeps us in an active fight or flight state. Rumination, exaggeration, anticipation and imagination, perceiving negative outcomes and threats prolong the stress state. As we continue to dwell, we reinforce this thinking and wire our brains to stay in the rut.

 Allan A. Wirth Wauwatosa - Allan A Wirth fought an immensely brave battle with Parkinson's over the better part of the last decade, but finally capitulated on Saturday, February 22nd, 2020 with his daughter, Paula, by his side. Allan is survived by his wife, JeanAnn, whom he adored, and who adored him back, after more than 61 years of marriage, having first met at a cello lesson in 1947. Allan is further survived byhis daughter Paula (Don) Pajewski of South Milwaukee, their three girls, Ana, Sophie, and Maryna; his son Bill (Rosemary) of Wauwatosa, and their sons Nicholas, Cole, and daughter Katy; his son Dan (Kim), and his four boys Alex, Zach, Ben, and Danny; and his son Patrick and Patrick's son, Sam; as well as his pseudo son by unofficial adoption, George (Jeanne) Gilly and their two daughters, Shannon and Caitlin. Allan is further survived by his big brother, Stuart (Kathleen), of Cross Plains, WI, his sister in law Barbara, of Wauwatosa, and his lovingformer daughter in law, Angie; but preceded in the losing battle against time by his younger brother Bob (Susan) of Modesto, CA, and younger sister Susan of Milwaukee. Allan is further survived by many relatives and many friends, the result of his perpetually generous and helpful ways. Born in Milwaukee on November 15th, 1931 to Bernard Aloysius and Florence Madeline (Steil) Wirth, Allan's parents were forced to move his family multiple times due to the Depression, but settled finally at a home at 6624 Revere Avenue in Wauwatosa, the week of the attack on Pearl Harbor, when Allan was ten. Graduating from Wauwatosa High school in 1949, Allan worked more jobs than we can possibly remember, including the soda fountain at Woolworths, as a paper boy, in the paint shop at the American Motors factory, as a laborer at the Trostel Tannery in Milwaukee, and as a cab driver for Yellow Cab, to name just a few. Graduating from the University of Wisconsin Milwaukee with degrees in music and education (adding a Masters of education from Marquette in 1965), he was hired by the Germantown School District to be the music/band director, where he taught from 1957 to 1975. He took his marching band on many trips, including to Winnipeg, Canada in 1966, the Cherry Blossom Festival in Washington D.C. in 1969, and again in 1975, and to the Macy's Thanksgiving Parade in New York in 1971, where his marching band was chosen for the distinct honor of escorting Santa Claus in their iconic Christmas tree formation. Then, in the summer of 1974, after having worked with his students on Russian music during the prior school year, he took his entire band to Russia, in the USSR. After 18 years of teaching, Allan resigned in 1975. He spoke constantly about how much he loved his students, but was no longer willing to tolerate the negative politics inherent in so many school districts. From teaching, he went into real estate, starting out by purchasing duplexes, fixing them up by his own hands, eventually moving on to larger and larger properties. There was scarcely a job that he was unwilling to tackle himself. At his busiest, he owned and operated dozens of properties throughout Wauwatosa, including nearly 200 units. His goals were simple; to be independent and to determine his own fate, based upon his own personal work ethic, which was to work very hard so that he could provide a life of experiences for his wife, his kids, his extended family and his many friends. By any measure, he achieved those goals. Allan's love for travel seems to have started in 1958, when he travelled to Europe by himself, in steerage, on the RMS Queen Elizabeth. The framed photos from that very trip were the starting point for an ever growing collection on the walls of the finished recreation room on 81st St. As his eldest kids became old enough to travel, he and Jean would take them along. By 1976, at which time all four of his kids were old enough to travel for extended periods, he would take the whole family to explore Europe for four or five weeks during summer, renting a VW bus, plugging in a car fridge (that would serve as a dirty laundry bag on the trip back home), and buying bread, butter, cheese and sandwich meat, in order to be able to afford to do it again the next year. As his grandchildren became old enough, he invited his kids and grandkids to go with their grandparents on their adventures. Next to his grandchildren, whom he adored and who adored him back, travel was what made him truly happy, and those adventures with his family and friends represented the pinnacle of enjoyment for him, as it did for his family. Over his lifetime, he traveled overseas on more than 200 different trips, visiting every continent, experiencing the Amazon rain forest, the Galapagos Islands, the pyramids of Egypt, the Falkland Islands, safaris in South Africa, treks in the Australian outback, and seven expeditions to Antarctica, a favorite place of his. Perhaps his defining attribute was that he generally felt that he could help nearly anyone, to fix nearly every problem. Truly generous to a fault. We were incredibly fortunate to have him for as long as we did, and he definitely fought valiantly to stay with us. He never once complained about his illness, and always said with absolute conviction that he was the luckiest man in the world. He is sorely missed. A gathering to toast this extraordinary man is in the works for later in March. For those wishing to join Allan's family for this gathering, please provide your name, email, and phone number, along with your connection to Allan, either to atoasttoallan@gmail.com, or directly to Bill Wirth at wmnw@hotmail.com, so that we may be able to let people know when these particulars have been finalized. Instead of flowers, please consider a donation to the Antarctic and Southern Ocean Coalition ( www.asoc.org ), the Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra ( www.mso.org ), the World Wildlife Fund ( www.worldwildlife.org ), the Milwaukee Rescue Mission ( milmission.org ), or any worthy organization that would benefit from your generosity. Finally, the family would like to offer our deepest and most heartfelt gratitude to the staff of the 3rd floor at the Lutheran Home in Wauwatosa, who took such compassionate care of Allan in his final days.

At a family gathering last summer, my wife's mom asked me to cook some meat from a deer that my father-in-law had shot. It was his first, and nobody seemed to know exactly what to do with it. The flesh of said deer resided in a cache of unlabeled Ziplocs in a chest freezer in the basement.      Chances are, every meat eater -- even those without ties to the hunting community -- has encountered a frozen hunk of mystery meat in the back of the freezer. Nobody wants meat to spoil. The resources, carbon emissions and death behind that meat make it precious. And while we may want to use that meat, we don't want to invest time and energy into a meal that nobody will care to eat.      How to properly freeze   Meat can definitely spoil in the freezer if it isn't properly processed and sealed, but there is nothing intrinsically wrong with long-frozen meat. In fact, the texture of meat can actually improve in the freezer, as tough chunks will soften with time.      The notion that meat can survive, much less thrive, in the freezer flies in the face of the belief that fresh meat is better. Wendy's hamburger restaurants make a big deal of their burger meat being 100% fresh. But raw meat is rotting meat. If you really want to keep red meat fresh for more than a few days, freeze it.      When you freeze meat, wrap it tightly in plastic. You don't want to leave any air pockets next to the meat, or they will fill with frost and cause freezer burn. If you don't have a vacuum sealer, plastic wrap will cling very tightly to meat.   If you then wrap the plastic-wrapped meat in butcher paper, shiny-side in, the meat should stay in pristine shape for well over a year.      And that bright white butcher paper practically begs to be drawn on with a sharpie. My son likes to draw pictures of the animal inside. The cook, of course, prefers meat labeled with all of the relevant information, like what kind of animal, which part and when it was packed.      Luckily, for those times when we are cooking blind, we have the mystery meat techniques, time-tested ways of assessing and preparing meat of uncertain age and origin. They aren't that complicated, and will give you the confidence you need to go in there and solve the mystery of the next piece of random meat you encounter.      How to cook   The first step is to thaw the meat slowly, still wrapped, to what's called the "sherbet" stage, where the surface is soft but not thawed, and the inner core is still solid, but softenening.      With a long, thin, sharp knife -- a filet knife, ideally -- trim the outside of the meat. Think of it like skinning an orange with a knife -- you want the peel gone, but you don't want to cut into the flesh beneath it. In the case of mystery meat -- as well as poorly sealed meat of known provenance -- that "peel" is a greyish layer of oxidized flesh. Keep trimming until the surface of your meat hunk is completely red, with no splotches of brown, grey or green. You may have to dig deeper near freezer-burned areas.      As you slice, make note of the musculature that is revealed. Is it smooth, uninterrupted muscle flesh, or is it crisscrossed with connective tissue?      When the surface of the meat is clean, slice off a thin piece -- less than ½-inch -- and do some analysis in the pan. Heat some oil, add salt and pepper, and cook the piece of meat on both sides. While you're at it, open a bottle of wine for proper enjoyment.      If, upon tasting this morsel you are like "WANT MOAR," then you are good to go. If your mouth has reservations, then you might need to pay attention.      It's possible for a piece of meat to taste good but to also have off-flavors. And it's easy to temporarily convince yourself that the good flavors outweigh the bad. You can mask flavor to a certain extent with spices, marinades and sauces, but ultimately a piece of mystery meat is not worth getting sick over. Trust your gut. If it doesn't taste right in any way, don't take the risk.      Truly bad meat is a lot more likely in the case of wild mystery meat. An outdoor hunt presents a whole new set of variables, like temperature, manner of death and how the animal was processed into meat. On the other hand, meat that was processed in a USDA inspected facility doesn't face those variables and should be fine -- unless it spoiled at home before you froze it, or something like that.   Assuming you have good meat beneath that oxidized peel, the pan test will also help you determine how chewable it is.      If it's tender, cut the sherbet meat into little cubes -- half-frozen meat is easy to cut. Cook the cubes in oil, with salt and pepper, and let them slowly build a crusty shell of brown armor.      You'll want to just shovel these browned cubes into your mouth and wash them down with wine. Or use them in tacos or fried rice.      If the meat is tough you will have to melt it, with an oven braise or in the slow cooker. Cook at 300 in water and wine, covered, until soft, which could take six to eight hours. With tough cuts that have been braised into submission, make stew or pulled meat sandwiches.
