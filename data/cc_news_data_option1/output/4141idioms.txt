On Nov. 3, all candidates for Isakson’s seat, regardless of partisan affiliation, will be on the ballot. According to many polls, Warnock is the Democrat most likely to advance to the expected run-off unless the January election ends up being between Loeffler and Collins—a possibility with Lieberman playing spoiler to Warnock’s chances.

The team can not afford to go off the boil like they did last year, when the All Blacks hammered the Wallabies at Eden Park after being shown up in Perth.

Must admit I’m a bit nervous about this game. I still believe the ABs can do it but even at this early stage Rennie has got the Wallabies going well. Take that with some Cheika like selections for the ABs, a couple of injuries to key players and Gus not having a great season in the middle and things aren’t that rosy for the ABs. I’m pretty sure the ABs can see a marked improvement in their decision making and I’m sure Reiko will never place a ball like that again so I’m still confident of a win. Just a tad nervous

"Make no mistake, though: theatre is not back in business. Having shuttered 18 productions worldwide seven months ago, all of which remain suspended, I cannot fully – let alone profitably – re-open my shows. As well as government go-ahead (even just a date), we're still waiting for an insurance scheme to protect our profession in the months ahead. Producing shows this Christmas is a tightrope act, but _The Comeback_ will go ahead – following approved Performing Arts working guidelines - and so long as government restrictions allow."
