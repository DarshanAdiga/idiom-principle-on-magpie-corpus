The council pointed out that Mrs Agoglia was not biologically related to Victoria and argued that they did not have a 'relationship of nexus'.
 The council suggested that she has no legal right to challenge the coroner's conclusion in the high court.
 It is understood Mrs Agoglia adopted Vicky's mum Donna, who died when she was eight.
 The council's current head of children's services, Paul Marshall, was allowed to give evidence behind closed doors to support the claim that giving Mrs Agoglia the bundle would cause 'serious risk of harm' to others.
 In a dramatic court hearing, it also emerged that 'new evidence' has come to light about Victoria's death in the last few weeks.

The larger iPhone 12 Pro Max variant has a 47 percent larger sensor on the main wide camera, which means bigger 1.7-micron pixels. Combined with the larger aperture, Apple says it produces 87 percent better low-light photos. The telephoto lens on the Max is longer, too—65mm, or about 2.5x, instead of 52mm or 2x on the regular Pro.
 The Pro Max uses sensor-shift stabilization, which should produce clearer and more detailed shots, especially in low light.
 Thanks to the new LiDAR sensor, the iPhone 12 Pro can focus better in dark environments, and can shoot night mode portrait shots.
 Both the regular and Pro models now shoot 10-bit HDR video, including support in the Dolby Vision format. While the iPhone 12 can do this up to 4K at 30fps, the 12 Pro can go all the way up to 60fps when shooting Dolby Vision.
 ## The iPhone 12 supports 5G networks
 While Android phones have supported 5G wireless networks for over a year, Apple hasn’t jumped on the bandwagon yet. The iPhone 12 changes all that. All models, from the iPhone 12 mini to the iPhone 12 Pro, now support 5G networks.

As with the iPhone 11 Pro, the iPhone 12 Pro comes in two sizes. This year, the display on the two models measure 6.1 inches and 6.7 inches, up from 5.8 inches and 6.5 inches. (Bear in mind that a 6.1-inch display is the same size as the regular, non-Pro iPhone 11.)
 This means the phone bodies themselves are a bit larger as well, though there’s less bezel area around the display, so it’s not as much larger as you might think, just a millimeter or two taller and wider. With a thickness of only 7.4mm, the iPhone 12 Pro is even thinner than the iPhone 11 Pro’s 8.1mm body.

Several economists have called for measures that work towards creating stability in business' balance sheets to engender confidence among India's lenders when the economy does indeed fully open up. With consumption and investment being the primary drivers of India's GDP, a failure to address muted demand and the prevalence of economic pessimism will not bode well for India's immediate financial future.
