One of the year's most exciting live albums was recorded February 1 at the Fallout Shelter in Norwood by a homegrown talent nurtured in the Boston-area music scene of the 1990s.
 "HypnoBoogie," by The Barrett Anderson Band is being released Friday, Sept. 25, on Whitaker Blues Records, and it is the kind of refreshingly vibrant, genre-crossing album that is a throwback to the days when rock 'n' roll acknowledged its roots in blues, but ventured wherever the spirit took it.
 That should be no surprise, considering that Anderson cites influences that range from Boston's beloved J. Geils Band to lo-rockers Morphine, and respects Kurt Cobain as much as Muddy Waters.
 Once he got hooked on music, Anderson was a prodigy of sorts, stepping onstage at the original House of Blues in Harvard Square at age 15 with legendary pianist Pinetop Perkins and guitarist Bob Margolin, both of whom were stalwarts in Muddy Waters' great band of the 1970s. As a result, he met harmonica ace Annie Raines, who mentioned how much her partner Paul Rishell loved acoustic blues, and before long Anderson was immersing himself in classic acoustic blues, taking lessons from Rishell. His path soon led to joining Ronnie Earl and the Broadcasters, the premier blues and jazz combo, where he played from 1999 to 2002.

 Anderson moved on to the rock 'n' blues of The Monster Mike Welch Band from 2002 to 2005, and by 2007 he was releasing his debut album, produced by Jimbo Mathus, the leader of the Squirrel Nut Zippers. By the time Anderson released his sophomore album, "The Long Fall," in 2012, he was in the midst of a five- year run with a trio featuring organist Ron Levy and drummer Per Hanson, two pillars of New England blues.
 The current format of the Barrett Anderson Band is a quartet, with second guitarist Charlie Mallet the newest member, joining drummer Doug MacLeod and bassist Jamie "Black Cat Bone" Hatch. On the new live album, Emily Anderson joins her husband's group to add harmony vocals.
 Anderson, 37, said he sees his music on "HypnoBoogie" as a result of all the musical connections he's been lucky enough to make through the years. We caught up with him last week by phone, from his home in the central Massachusetts town of Petersham. Hatch and Macleod also live in the small (population 1,234) town, while Mallet lives in the adjacent town of Royalston.
 "I was in the right place at the right time that night I played with Pinetop and Bob Margolin," Anderson said. "I had no perspective on what it meant then, but I did feel incredibly lucky and grateful -- being onstage with them was an absolute dream come true for me. Maybe a year later, Ronnie Earl spent a week in Memphis when I was playing in his band and we were hanging out with Levon Helm. I knew a song or two he'd done with The Band, but not much more. I'd give anything to be able to spend a week with Levon now. I'm grateful for all those experiences, but also that the music community took me in like they did. I have been wonderfully supported like that for my whole career. And it's all traceable to that night with Pinetop and Bob, meeting Annie, studying with Paul Rishell, leading me to Ronnie Earl. It's amazing how all these little strands, these fingers of connections, came together to lead me on to better things."
 Anderson also had developed an interest in contemporary music, and was fascinated by how Morphine used Mark Sandman's two-string bass to craft its own moody take on rock, for instance. And as his musical appetite searched for more roots music, he also came to love how contemporaries like The White Stripes or The Allman Brothers Band merged blues and rock.
 "I think you take your influences wherever you find them," said Anderson. "The blues genre can be very interesting that way. Muddy Waters played music to make people move, and that's why it is still vital and new. I love to celebrate the rock of the last 20 years, but I do think (traditional acoustic bluesman) Son House, Muddy and Kurt Cobain are all trying to do the same thing. Music that matters is not just about the notes. That aesthetic is central to what I'm trying to do."
 The new album's 11 cuts certainly showcase the band's versatility. And the four covers aptly demonstrate the range of their influences, from the gritty rock of Bo Diddley's "Mona," to the driving rock take on Magic Sam's "Lookin' Good," to a modernized sprint through Son House's "Grinnin' In Your Face." And of course, the J. Geils Band's raucous good times anthem, "House Party" ends the CD on a fiery note. But Anderson's originals are just as compelling, from the brisk slide guitar tune "Broken Down," to the haunting, swampy lo-rock sound of "Not Your Baby."
 Perhaps the most striking number is "The Long Fall," a magnificent instrumental that clocks in at 13:38, and has three or four movements while shifting between psychedelic rock to easy flowing twang to a jazzy sort of blues rock that builds to a gradual crescendo. The guitar work throughout is marvelous, finely articulated and subtle yet intense.
 "The Long Fall' was one of the first songs I wrote, back in 1998-99," Anderson explained. "It was very influenced by my playing with Ronnie Earl at the time. I had been planning on it for my 2012 album, but while I had ideas how it should sound, we couldn't quite get it, so it never made the album -- even if the album has that name. With this lineup, it all fell together. The song has evolved. Now, with Charlie Mallet on second guitar, he's very thoughtful and is careful that he adds to the song without stepping on any toes. The song has developed as we played over the previous six to eight months and that night at The Fallout Shelter was a particularly inspired night. "
 The band had performed at The Fallout Shelter in last fall's Boston Blues Challenge, liked the vibe, and since the venue has its own audio and video equipment, decided it was perfect for the live CD. Anderson and Fallout Shelter manager Bill Hurley scheduled the show for February 1, and the result is a gem.

NORWELL -- Anna Duarte joined the team at Trattoria San Pietro when the restaurant opened in 1991. She was a student at the Berklee College of Music living in the North End when the restaurant owners were looking for Italian- speaking employees. As a first-generation Italian American, Duarte fit the bill and loaded into a van every day to head to Norwell.
 Having found a greater passion in restaurant work, she eventually quit school, married a chef, and worked her way up from bus girl to the part owner of Trattoria by age 24. Today, her restaurant continues to serve Italian dishes made just the way her family prepared them in Southern Italy.
 "I can't believe I did that at such a young age. And that I'm still here," said Anna Duarte.
 She owned the restaurant with one of the founders, Vincenzo Nocera, until he died in the fall of 2018. Since then, she has been running it with the help of her husband and fellow restaurateur, Jose Duarte.
 "I think this is the most traditional Italian food you can get around here," said Peruvian chef Jose Duarte -- the mind behind Tambo 22 in Chelsea and Taranta in the North End, which just closed due to the pandemic.

 Anna Duarte's family is from Siano, which is in the Campania region of Italy. The late Nocera was from the same town and knew her parents. With deep roots in Italian culture and food, the two built a business serving authentic Italian food as it would be cooked if one was in Siano.
 She said in its nearly 30-year history, they haven't changed much of anything.
 When Jose Duarte more recently took on a bigger role at the restaurant, he noticed they were going through a significant amount of olive oil every week. He learned it's because they use fresh oil to fry each dish to order.
 "It's like my mother would make it. If you go to my aunt's house in Italy, that's how she prepares the pork chops," Anna Duarte said.
 The meatballs are made in her mother's style. The pasta dishes have simple flavors, and customers might find the pasta e fagioli to be thick like a porridge, not watery, but that's the way it's made in Italy.
 One of the least authentic dishes on the menu is the parmigiana di pollo, also known as chicken Parmesan, but it's one of the most popular.
 Anna Duarte said they don't really make that in Italy and Nocera was quite adamant about keeping it off the menu. But, seeing how much the customers wanted it, she convinced him to put it on the menu.
 More authentic dishes include a special they do once in a while, called braciola, which also has roots in Southern Italy. Usually it is made with goat, but at Trattoria they use beef that is flattened and stuffed with garlic, pecorino and parsley. It is rolled, tied, covered in more cheese, and cooked in tomato sauce for a few hours.
 With Jose Duarte having a more present role at the restaurant after the closure of Taranta, an Italian-Peruvian fusion restaurant, they want to start bringing bring educational opportunities for the staff and customers in the future.
 At Taranta, Jose Duarte took his employees to Peru or Italy to learn where the food and recipes come from. He also offered "culinary adventures" for customers to tour the countries with the Duartes as their guides.
 "We basically make [our staff] understand their menu, so if they're selling a buffalo mozzarella ... they saw how the cattle is raised, what it is being fed, the whole process," said Jose Duarte. "If we can grow their knowledge, we can grow their experiences and transfer that to our customers... and we want to do that [at Trattoria]."
 With a mix of familiar and less familiar Italian dishes, it is the Duartes' hope that with the help of education of staff and customers, customers can more fully immerse themselves in and understand the true essence of Italian cooking.
 "It's not just food thrown on a plate, there's a story," said Anna Duarte.
