Sheila said she travelled on the train from Cardiff to Swansea to see her brother earlier this month.
 "I was coming out of the station and I asked [the conductor] if the taxi rank was still where it used to be," she recalled.
 "They said yes and I continued walking where I would normally go. They stopped me and said 'no, you can't use that exit'. I had to go the long way out which I was not familiar with."
 When Sheila goes out shopping, one of the ways she's able to identify what she's buying is by touching them.
 "I'm a touchy-feely person. I have to pick it up to see if it's the right item. But now with the virus around it's more difficult and I can't do that as much."
 She said more needs to be done to support disabled people, and particularly those with sight problems, during this crisis.
 "We do need extra help. We do need to know we can go places without feeling inferior."

The high the Arizona Cardinals are riding right now comes at a good time considering their next game is Thursday night.
 The Cardinals have a 6-3 record and are in a three-way tie for first place in the NFC West after their stunning 32-30 win over the Buffalo Bills. DeAndre Hopkins made an improbable catch over three Buffalo defenders with 2 seconds left, securing the 43-yard touchdown catch that set off a huge celebration on the Arizona sideline.
 Now Arizona is preparing for a game on the road against division rival Seattle. It’s another chance for second-year quarterback Kyler Murray, Hopkins and the rest of the Cardinals to show what they can do on a national stage.
 “It obviously gives us some confidence,” Kingsbury said. “We know it’s going to be another dog fight on Thursday and we’ve got to get healthy and healed up quickly. Celebrate this one for a few hours tonight and be ready tomorrow, because it will come fast.

Judge Paul Thomas QC said Davies was responsible for a "campaign" of rape against his young victim, abuse which would have a life-long impact on her.
 As he came to pass sentence the defendant slumped to the floor in the dock - the third such incident at recent hearings. Judge Thomas called it a "spectacular if not terribly convincing" incident, and once Davies had resumed his seat he continued with the sentencing.
 Giving the defendant a one quarter discount for his guilty pleas the judge sentenced him to 16-and-a-half years in prison. Davies will serve up to half that period in custody before being released on licence to serve the remainder in the community.
 The defendant will be a registered sex offender for the rest of his life, and was made the subject of an indefinite sexual harm prevention order to limit his access to children.

GLENDALE, Ariz. (AP) — The high the Arizona Cardinals are riding right now comes at a good time considering their next game is Thursday night.
 The Cardinals have a 6-3 record and are in a three-way tie for first place in the NFC West after their stunning 32-30 win over the Buffalo Bills. DeAndre Hopkins made an improbable catch over three Buffalo defenders with 2 seconds left, securing the 43-yard touchdown catch that set off a huge celebration on the Arizona sideline.
 Now Arizona is preparing for a game on the road against division rival Seattle. It's another chance for second-year quarterback Kyler Murray, Hopkins and the rest of the Cardinals to show what they can do on a national stage.
 “It obviously gives us some confidence," Kingsbury said. "We know it’s going to be another dog fight on Thursday and we’ve got to get healthy and healed up quickly. Celebrate this one for a few hours tonight and be ready tomorrow, because it will come fast.
 "Our guys like playing when the spotlight is on us and I’m excited about Thursday night.”
 The Cardinals' offense continued to pile up the yards and points against the Bills. Murray threw for 245 yards and a touchdown and also ran for 61 yards and two touchdowns. Hopkins had seven catches for 127 yards and the last- second TD.

What do the parties say? The Trump campaign maintains that its monitors were kept too far away to meaningfully observe the process. Even after the court order allowing them closer access, they maintain that the city never fully complied.
 City elections administrators contend that Trump monitors were in the room the whole time and subjected to the same restrictions as Democratic observers. They note that state law only requires that monitors have access and does not specify how close they must be allowed to the votes being tallied.
 This suit does not allege any ballots were improperly included in the city’s tally and a court ruling here would not affect the final results. Given that the Trump campaign won the earlier round of this fight, a campaign win at the Supreme Court would not change the status quo.
 — Disputes over individual ballots (Common Pleas and Commonwealth courts)
 The Trump campaign also continues to press a number of cases before county courts seeking to toss thousands of mail ballots for technical errors made by voters when submitting them. It lost the largest of those cases — contesting some 8,300 ballots in Philadelphia for deficiencies such as missing signatures or dates — on Friday but has appealed the ruling. Meanwhile, it is pursuing similar fights over 2,300 ballots in Allegheny County and 2,251 ballots in Bucks County.
 Campaign lawyers have acknowledged that they are not claiming voter fraud in any of these suits and they agree that all of the contested ballots came from registered voters. However, they maintain that state law says mail ballots must be signed, dated and included in a secrecy envelope and that voters who forgot to take one of those steps should have their ballots disqualified.
 Democrat lawyers have urged courts to err on the side of enfranchising voters if they made a good-faith effort to follow the instructions. Voting by mail, they say, shouldn’t be a game of “gotcha.”
 The cases before courts at the moment involve roughly 12,800 ballots statewide — far too few to change the results of Pennsylvania’s election even if he were to win them all.

Roethlisberger admitted he might have had a little extra zip on the ball thanks to a low-key week in which he worked from home when contact tracing conducted after teammate and good friend Vance McDonald tested positive for COVID-19 required Roethlisberger to stay away from the team facility for five days.
 He took advantage of the downtime, throwing about 50 passes on Friday, but otherwise giving his body a much-needed break.
 Considering the way he played, the Steelers might want to consider a “less is more” approach going forward.
 Either way, Roethlisberger’s performance is validating the team’s decision to spend the offseason stocking up on talent to win now rather than begin concentrating on the post-Roethlisberger era.

We've all seen something so bizarre, strange, coincidental or funny that we're convinced that's probably the only time in our whole lives we'll ever see something like it...Whether it's a startling event in nature or a hilariously timed fall or mysterious interaction with a stranger, it's nice to look up from our phones every once in awhile or we'll miss the dolphin leaping over a surfer while holding a ball in its mouth. Shout out to the time I was having a conversation with my friend and when she changed the subject I said, "great segue-way!" just as a man riding a segway rode by. Shooting stars, a patch of four-leaf clovers, a bus full of people dressed in the same exact inflatable teddy bear costume, a horse that can seemingly tap dance-- life is full of myserious and sometimes spooky surprises.So, when a Reddit user asked, "What's something you've only seen once in real life that you don't think you'll ever see again?" people were ready to share their most memorable, once-in-a-lifetime sightings.1. At a burlesque show I went to once, a professional clown who happened to be eight months pregnant came out to do an act. She was wearing a crop top exposing her now-huge belly and a tutu and had the full clown make up. During the act she looked at the audience with disdain, unscrewed the lid of a giant jar of pickles, and guzzled the whole jar's pickle juice until it was running down her body and belly. - skonen_blades 2. In Australia a few years ago, there was a dust storm that made pretty much everything outside a dark orange. The sunrise in the morning was a dark red, and I seriously considered it was the apocalypse until I saw dust covered cars. It was apparently the worst in 70-ish years. It was a beautiful sight I may never see again. - blaisems 3. In India, I was waiting in a taxi outside a convenience store for my mum to finish her shopping, and I saw a guy come out of the store with a bottle of mango juice in his hand. He looked around to see that he wasn't being observed and then poured all the juice inside the fuel tank of a parked motorcycle nearby. He then left, cackling to himself. - cim09 4. Two miniature dachshunds chasing emus (yes more than one) all over the fields and finally cornering them and causing one to jump over a 5ft fence in terror... Was hard to stop laughing long enough to call the dogs off. - [deleted] 5. When sailing in the mediterranean I once saw dolphins diving in our bow wave. Dolpins in the med aren't that special and surfing bow waves isn't really exotic behaviour for dolphins. But this was at night while we had really intense marine phosphorescence. I was on the foredeck to check our jib and then saw this pair of dolphins glowing and sparkling in a green light trailing phosphorous traces through the black water. The sight was so kitschy and looked so fake that if I had been presented with it in a movie I would have laughed at the ridiculously bad CGI. - nondescriptPlank 6. Saw two identical mid 80's chevrolets park outside a 7-11 within a few minutes of each other. When the two owners of the cars came outside, they each went to the wrong car and spent a good 30 seconds wondering why their keys suddenly didn't work. - SwanseaJack1 7. Haley's Comet. I probably won't see it again, but I still hold out hope! - LeonidLeonov 8. I once saw a kid who was about 10 years old pushing a pram down the street whist riding a unicycle. Oh, and I once saw a seagull fly straight into a lamp-post. - Crusty_Gusset 9. Not 5 minutes after I got kicked out of swim practice due to a thunderstorm, I got to see one of the lampposts by the pool get struck by lightning. Everyone changing in the locker rooms thought it was a gunshot. - ChrispyK 10. I was driving down a 5 lane road on my way to work, 2 lanes in either direction and a turning lane. I turned a bend in the road and saw 2 cars in the turning lane that had hit each other, possibly seconds before I showed up. People were running away from both of the cars to either side of the road, there was a lot of smoke coming out of one. 30 seconds later one of them exploded. Only time I've ever seen a car explode in real life and I was a few hundred feet away. - dizmog 11. While rock climbing, I saw a guy free soloing the cliff. He was about 100 feet up when he fell. He somehow spun mid fall and grabbed a branch from the only tree growing on the cliff. The tree bent with his weight and deposited him on a ledge. He lit a cigarette and down climbed. - [deleted] 12. A few years ago when I was in high school, we used to play Ninja-Tag out in the woods at night. On this particular night, the fireflies had started to spawn, there were MILLIONS of them. The ENTIRE woods looked exactly like the scene from Avatar. (I live in Michigan, so it was kind of uncommon to see so many fireflies) It was the most beautiful thing I've ever seen - Crossifix 13. The most brilliant meteor ever pass over the San Francisco bay area, and my roommate and I were out on our backyard. This wasn't a shooting star, it was a giant glowing fireball way brighter than the full moon, and it casts shadows in our yard as it passed overhead. - zelmerszoetrop 14. Back in March 2010, I took a mountain hike with my grandfather to look at a volcanic eruption up close. The trek was long and hard, it was cold (something like -10 Celcius) and dangerous if you didn't watch your step. But I finally got up there, and lo and behold, I saw a lavafall (yeah, that's like a waterfall, except it's lava.) It was beyond glorious - Veeron 15. I've seen my best friend, her mom, her maternal grandma, and her maternal great-grandmother conversing in the same room. Definitely not as traumatic as some of the other comments on here, but I highly doubt I'll see something like this again, considering how "direct" the line was. As for strange, I saw a woman reading a book on the back of a motorcycle once. Pages floppin' everywhere. - symbiosa 16. My friend was grabbing a cd case from a table. He drops the case, and it lands on it's side, and remains upright. To this day I still can't believe it happened. - frink99887 17. When I was around 10 or 11, my mum and I had gone out for a walk one evening after a snowfall in Manchester. The clouds had gone and the moon was full and shining very brightly. Our path took us along side a golf course. As we passed a large open part of it we noticed 2 foxes playing and wrestling with eachother in the fresh snow, under the bright moonlight. It was a beautiful scene that will stick with me forever. - hates_walls 18. When I was a kid, the family and I went on a holiday to Africa, while sitting on the roof of the landrover we saw a leopard kill an antelope. I don't think I'll ever see something so majestic and peaceful again. The leopard grabbed the antelope by the throat and it seemed to accept that it was its time. No blood, and hardly a struggle.

The argument comes as the federal Bureau of Prisons still struggles with an exploding number of coronavirus cases behind bars. As of Monday, 3,121 federal inmates and 1,049 staff members have confirmed COVID-19 cases at federal prisons around the U.S., including two inmates and three staff members at the prison where Montgomery is being held. Six inmates have died there and more than 500 other inmates at the prison were previously diagnosed with the virus but have since recovered, according to federal statistics.

McConnell has repeatedly said he doesn't see a need for new testing or mask mandates in the Senate, where almost all members have worn masks and office space is more spread out. Pelosi instituted new mask requirements on the House side of the Capitol in August after some Republicans refused to wear them and a handful of members tested positive after attending hearings together.
