I mostly went to the swimming pool in the early days to see Carol Jean Ellis. I'm telling you with all my heart, she was the prettiest girl God ever made! And don't give me that Doris Day, Marilyn Monroe, Elizabeth Taylor talk….. They couldn't hold a candle to her!
   
 She just looked good all over. Her hair was amazing. Her eyes actually glowed. She kinda floated by, more than walked. She had the best laugh I've ever seen….or heard! And she wore that dark red bathing suit like she was born to it.
   
 One smile from Carol Jean would melt a Baby Ruth candy bar.
   
 I never spoke to her. EVER! Sometimes being eight years old was a handicap. She was four years my senior. And, believe me that was like light years back in 1955!
   
 She never knew of course. And my abject timidity sealed both our fates forever. But I could watch her from near and far at the ole swimming hole.
   
 Twin Pools was an icon in our little town. Like Pat Houston's Grocery. The Park Theatre. J. A. Abernathy's Hardware. And the World War I cannon up on the square.
   
 You could hear the music blasting out of speakers located under the high diving boards before the big wooden building fronting the two large pools came into view. The whole thing sat back off the road. Leaving ample room for parking…..and sunbathing….
   
 Oh, and Carol Jean Ellis could sunbathe like nobody you've ever seen!
   
 I hung around the pool so much Mr. Roe Alexander gave me a job.
   
 Talk about a happening place! Folks came from town and farm to leap into the refreshing waters; the good times rolling in their heads even before they could get the necessary 50 cent fee into Mr. Roe's outstretched hand.
   
 Roe met one and all with a smile and a friendly word. He also prayed for a sunshiny day like a repentant sinner sought a light from above.
   
 The first eight and a half customers paid my whole day's salary. I was going to check baskets, keep the 45 RPM records "stacked and dropping" and watch people swim for the next nine hours.
   
 It was a way of life in the summers of my youth.
   
 And you'll never hear me complain. Carol Jean wasn't the only attraction. The solid gold background music never stopped. The Coasters "Charlie Brown" rings in my head to this day.
   
 Elvis sang everything from "Heartbreak Hotel" to "I Want You, I Need You, I Love You." Roe was big on Clarence "Frogman" Henry and Clyde McPhatter. All the young swimmers clamored for The Kingston Trio's "Reverend Mr. Black." And nobody could sit still when Chuck Berry cut down on "Maybellene", "Sweet Little Sixteen" or "Johnny B. Goode."
   
 I remember the summer Roy Orbison stopped by, took one look at Carol Jean Ellis and wrote "Pretty Woman" on the spot!
   
 It wasn't all about music and girls. I had a front row seat to see Jimmy Joe Fitzgerald swim. Talk about amazing! I could do a back flip off that high diving board, and a half gainer from a pike position. I could do a front layout. And sometimes I'd add a twist--Jimmy Joe could do them ALL IN ONE DIVE!
   
 He had no fear! And he was always laughing. It was fun personified the moment he walked in. He could light that pool up!
   
 You can't imagine the number of faces I can still see leaping out of the water.
   
 We had swimming classes. I loved it when one of the little people realized they could put their head completely under. Or float ON TOP OF THE WATER. It wouldn't take them long after that….they'd take off like Johnny Weissmuller in a Tarzan movie.
   
 We held diving contests. We would race from one end of the pool to the other. We'd crawl up on each other's shoulders and go to war. We'd play chase and tag…..and lay in the sun and exchange dreams.
   
 Maybe pretty tame stuff by today's standards. But believe me, we didn't think so back then. What a gathering place! Friendships were born there. And more than one or two love affairs….
   
 They still make movies about such times.
   
 It shaped my life in so many ways. And the good friends and daily adventures are forever forged in my memory bank.
   
 I am so much the richer for it.
   
 And Roe always declared I was the best lifeguard he ever had……if someone was drowning within a two foot radius of Carol Jean Ellis!
   
 Respectfully,
   
 Kes

The Srebrenica genocide of 1995, during which over 8,000 Bosnian Muslim men and boys were killed, was the worst atrocity on European soil since the Second World War. This massacre occurred in the midst of the systematic ethnic cleansing of Bosniak Muslims in the 1992-1995 Bosnian war. A quarter of a century later, Almasa Salihovic and Emir Suljagic, survivors of Srebrenica, along with Safet Vukalic, a survivor of the 1992 Prijedor massacre, believe the lessons of this tragic event are being ignored as open genocide denial from the Bosnian Serb leadership becomes more brazen and nationalist. This, also, at a time when far-right political discourse becomes normalised across Europe.  
 Almasa was just 8 years old when she, her mother and siblings along with over 20,000 civilians, were forcibly expelled from Srebrenica. Her 18-year-old brother Abdullah was caught during a failed escape attempt and was murdered. Only 30 percent of his remains were found, subsequently buried over a decade later in 2008. In the light of far-right terrorists worldwide using Bosnia as inspiration for the persecution of Muslims, Almasa says her responsibility is not just in the fighting of the government's genocide denial, but is in the vanguard of a global struggle to speak about Srebrenica in the same way as the Holocaust is remembered.  The perpetrator behind last year's massacre in a Mosque in Christchurch, sang along to Serbian nationalist songs glorifying those behind Srebrenica - people such as Ratko Mladic and Radovan Karadzic - as he live-streamed the murders of 51 worshippers. The white supremacist Norwegian terrorist, Anders Brevik, mentioned Bosnia 300 times in his manifesto.  
 Whilst Europe and the UK may be far from seeing another Srebrenica-like scenario, Dunja Mijatovic, the current Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights from Bosnia and Herzegovina, says it serves as a cautionary tale of what happens when a European commitment towards diversity and multiculturalism wanes. Post World War II, Europe was supposedly built on the foundation of 'never again' repeating the horrors of the Nazi Holocaust or the nationalism which produced it.  Yet Srebrenica occurred in the heart of Europe and is within our living memory.  A particularly important part of this cautionary tale is the role the media played in demonising minorities.
 Safet Vukalic, a teenager at the time of the 1992 Prijedor massacre, remembers only too well the impact it had. He witnessed how Bosnian Serb and Serbian authorities, in the lead up to systematic slaughter, orchestrated a mass media campaign that drip-fed propaganda painting Bosniak Muslims as killers and as an existential threat to Serb people. Safet recounted how he would hear propaganda such as Muslim doctors mass sterilising Serbs, Muslims having kill lists, and Bosniak Muslims being othered as 'Turks'.  
 Official government media also played a crucial role in dehumanising Tutsis and mobilising ordinary Hutus to engage in the Rwandan Genocide. In Rwanda, authorities sent machetes and other weapons to Hutu households to kill their Tutsi neighbours, Safet remembers that Bosnian Serb authorities sent guns to every Serb household in his part of Bosnia. Emir Suljagic was keen to emphasise how Kofi Annan, the then UN head of peacekeeping operations, and the international community failed both Bosnia and Rwanda at the same point of history.
 Armed with this knowledge of how othering often precedes mass killing, Safet has become more worried about the position of Muslims in the United Kingdom, where he has lived since escaping Bosnia in 1993. Islamophobia proliferates in the UK, particularly in the wake of the Brexit vote. A few years ago The Sun newspaper in the UK falsely reported that one in five Muslims supported ISIS. This came as hate crime has appeared to double in the UK over the preceding 5 years. During the coronavirus crisis, elements of the right-wing press manufactured fears of Muslims congregating in mosques and community centres during Ramadan, risking viral transmission.
 Further afield in India, social and government media channels have held the country's 200 million Muslims responsible for spreading coronavirus, which has manifested in an upsurge of violence and hate crimes against Indian Muslims. There are increasing calls for social media giants like Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp and others to monitor and take action to stop the proliferation of racist messaging online and for mainstream politicians to be held to account. Anti-Muslim hate crimes in the UK rose by 375 percent after the current UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson described Muslim women with face coverings as ''letterboxes'' in 2018. Whilst Boris Johnson's comments are not on a par with the nationalist rhetoric of Serb leaders such as Slobodan Milosevic or Radovan Karadzic during the Bosnian war, it shows how those in power have a responsibility to use their platforms wisely.
 All three survivors I spoke to reflected on the insidious nature of fixating on the assimilation of Muslims into 'European values'. The Bosnian war, like the Holocaust before it, tragically demonstrated the danger of this narrative. Much as the highly-integrated German Jewish communities were not spared from the Nazi extermination campaigns, similarly nativised Bosnian Muslims were not spared the onslaught of genocide.
 The survivors all emphasised how well integrated Bosnian Muslims were with their Serb and Croat neighbours, wearing the same clothes, eating the same food, in many cases living the same secular lifestyle to the point that Emir argues they were losing their religious identity. He argues European and Western identity has for centuries defined itself in its binary opposition to Islam and Jewry.
 This historic antagonism bore bitter fruit - including the Crusades, the Spanish Reconquista, the Holocaust and of course the Bosnian war.  Emir shares the view of Bill Clinton, the American president at the time of the Bosnian war, that European leaders were prejudiced against Bosnia due to its majority Muslim population. According to the Clinton Tapes:
 'European allies constantly blocked proposals to adjust or remove the arms embargo imposed on Bosnia because "an independent Bosnia would be 'unnatural' as the only Muslim nation in Europe"....Clinton said President Francois Mitterrand of France had been especially blunt in saying that Bosnia did not belong and that British officials spoke of a painful but realistic restoration of Christian Europe'
 Within Bosnia, Republika Srpska has institutionalised genocide denial. Emir, Almasa and Safet all strongly believe that this Bosnian Serb entity, which now controls 49% of Bosnian territory, was the construct of a murderous campaign but has since been legitimised by the international community in the wake of the 1995 Dayton peace agreement which ended the war. For all the survivors it is no surprise that Milorad Dodik, the Serb member of the Bosnian presidency, dismisses the Srebrenica Genocide as a "fabricated myth", nor that a commission to investigate war crimes whitewashes Serb atrocities.  
 Denial has become so flagrant that Bosnian Serb authorities plan to build a statue of Peter Handke, a controversial Nobel laureate known for his denial of the Srebrenica genocide. Almasa tells me survivors' pain is compounded by the fact that today's mayor of Srebrenica denies the genocide, victims are coming face to face with perpetrators in their daily lives and local figures celebrate July 11 as a day of national celebration. In some cases, streets, statues and buildings have been renamed to celebrate Bosnian Serb war criminals and their allies.
 Safet, Amir and Almasa's message to the world is that if genocide denial is not confronted in Bosnia, in the near future, the country could very well see a return to war. With the unfolding State-backed repression of Muslim communities in Myanmar, Kashmir and China, and increasingly normalised antipathy towards Muslims in Europe, reflecting on what happened at Srebrenica 25 years on, has never been so relevant.

Finding agreement between competing Democratic and Republican proposals for another COVID-19 relief package and separate police reform legislation could be "a long shot" before Congress begins its month-long summer recess, U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin said Thursday.
   
 But if it can be done, it's worth delaying the recess, the No. 2 Democrat in the Senate said after meeting with local officials and members of the East Peoria Chamber of Commerce.
   
 "We ought to get down to the business of addressing the issues that will affect the economy right here in central Illinois," he said.
   
 Among provisions Durbin supports in another relief package is an extension of the federal boost on unemployment benefits that offers an additional $600 per week to recipients, and which is currently slated to expire July 31.
   
 "That would be devastating for so many families across the state," Durbin said, noting the latest Illinois unemployment statistics that show 946,400 people receiving unemployment assistance. Some 47 million are receiving those benefits nationwide.
   
 "If we don't push more activity into this economy, give people who are laid off the resources they need to keep their families together at home, pay their rent, pay their mortgages, put food on the table, the basics in life, then it's going to be a dramatic hardship on those families, and it will not help this economy recover," Durbin said, pointing out that such assistance is likely to be returned directly into the economy.
   
 He also shared his concern about Peoria Charter Coach's financial difficulties. On Wednesday the company announced it was laying off 95% of its staff and renewed its please for more federal and state aid. Durbin said he was looking into what other federal assistance might be available for the company.
   
 Later in the day, U.S. Rep. Darin LaHood introduced bipartisan House legislation mirroring a bipartisan Senate measure that would provide $10 billion in grant funding and other aid to companies like Peoria Charter, as well as school bus companies and other transportation providers.
   
 Company owner Bill Winkler said in a prepared statement that such an approach could give the "motorcoach industry a fighting chance to survive the pandemic."
   
 Durbin expressed his support for a number of elements in the House-passed HEROES Act that's considered unlikely to be brought to the floor in its current form by Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell. That includes aid to local governments.
   
 "I think that is essential," Durbin said.
   
 He's also a backer of another economic stimulus bill on top of the one earlier this year that provided $1,200 to each adult and $500 for each child in a household.
   
 This time, Durbin believes, everyone ought to receive $1,200 regardless of age.
   
 "Will President Trump be able to sign the checks again? Be my guest, if that's what it takes to get this passed, I think that helping hand is really needed for families." he said.

This is not the first time Lee has explored the contrast between love and violence; in 1989’s “Do the Right Thing,” Mookie and fellow Bedford-Stuyvesant residents wonder whether they should choose love or “Fight the Power” after a series of racial conflicts in their changing neighborhood. The film ends with a King quote and a Malcolm X quote rolling down the screen. The moments following King’s death in “Da 5 Bloods” complement “Do the Right Thing” perfectly, as the film depicts violent uprisings in protest of the murder of a famously peace-loving man.

Though Stormin’ Norman appears to be an accessory to the story, he’s ultimately deeper than that. Norman is Lee’s messenger, his way of showing the concurrence of the Vietnam War and the Civil Rights Movement. Otis fondly describes Norman by saying, “He was our Malcolm and our Martin,” encapsulating the central love versus violence struggle that lives in these Black soldiers. When Hanoi Hannah, a subversive North Vietnamese radio announcer, addresses Black soldiers to break the news of King’s death, Lee seamlessly integrates images of King’s funeral and civil rights protests with the devastated young Bloods. Hannah reminds the men of one tragic irony of the Vietnam war: disproportionate numbers of Black Americans are forced to fight for a country that refuses to give them equal rights. The enlightened Bloods momentarily vow to kill white American soldiers rather than Vietnamese until Norman reins them in. “We won’t let nobody use our rage against us,” he says.
