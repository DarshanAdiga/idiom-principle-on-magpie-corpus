BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (WBRC) - It’s tough to believe a year has passed since little Kamille “Cupcake” McKinney was abducted while attending a birthday party at Tom Brown Village on Oct. 12, 2019.Investigators believed her life was taken the same night.The 3-year-old became everyone’s child as the community held their own children closer while searching tirelessly to find Cupcake.The search ended 10 days later at the Santek Waste Services landfill near Gardendale. Kamille’s small body was left in a dumpster.The two people charged with Kamille’s murder, 40-year-old Patrick Stallworth and 30-year-old Derick Irisha Brown, have yet to go to trial. A year later, they both remain behind bars.Frank Barefield with Crime Stoppers said the community stood up for Kamille.“We got over 400 tips. Some of the best tips were one identifying the suspects and another identifying some key evidence in the case,” said Barefield.The community speaking up proved the importance of community involvement to help solve cases. It was a sentiment her parents spoke about in April 2020 during a birthday celebration for Kamille.“It’s nice to know that there a people out there with genuine hearts, and you know kind, and people who care,” said Kamille’s mom April Thomas.The community also stepped up with their money by donating $45,000 to Crime Stoppers. According to Barefield, the money was put to good use in Kamille’s honor.“We set up the Kamille ‘Cupcake’ McKinney Memorial Reward Fund and that is to help find lost children,” explained Barefield.The case has been bound over to the grand jury. Jefferson County District Attorney Danny Carr said the grand jury was still operational despite the pandemic.The last movement in the case happened Tuesday, Oct 6. According to court documents, Stallworth’s attorney, Roderick Livingston, was allowed to withdraw himself from the case because he was hired by the public defender’s office that represents Brown.We’ll keep you updated as this case moves through the legal system.Copyright 2020 WBRC.

Daniel Carlson converted field goal attempts of 38 and 43 yards and is 12-for-13 this season. He did miss an extra point, which could have been a body blow had the Raiders not played such good defense and held the ball for so long in the second half. A.J. Cole punted only twice but it was for a 53-yard net and gross, placing one inside the 20-yard line. There was no punt or kickoff return damage to speak of inflicted by either team. A penalty pushed the Raiders from the 10 to the 5 following a Chiefs punt. An illegal block by Nicholas Morrow on a kickoff was responsible for another drive starting at the 9.

Jimmy Garoppolo was benched in the second half of the San Francisco 49ers' Week 5 loss to the Miami Dolphins in part due to an ankle injury that caused him to miss the previous two games. Garoppolo was able to make his first start in weeks, but wasn't anywhere near his pre-injury form -- finishing 7 of 17 for 77 yards with two interceptions and a 15.7 passer rating. After the game, 49ers coach Kyle Shanahan hinted Garoppolo's recovery from an injury played a factor in the decision to bench him for the second half. While the performance was Garoppolo's worst in a 49ers uniform, he refuses to blame the injury as a result.
 "I wouldn't say it affected everything. It's one of those things you've got to deal with," Garoppolo said. "It's tough. It was a tough one today. You just want to be out there with the guys, wanted to get the win today, obviously didn't and it was just a lot of things didn't go well for us."
 Garoppolo had to hear the whispers of a potential benching when Nick Mullens played well in a Week 3 win over the New York jets, only for that talk to be silenced a week later as Mullens was benched himself in a Week 4 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles. C.J. Beathard, who played well in relief of Mullens, wasn't as efficient subbing for Garoppolo -- finishing 9 of 18 for 94 yards and a touchdown in the 43-17 blowout loss.

New Delhi: The supply of clean and safe water is essential for public health therefore, ensuring supply of water along with regular testing is imperative. The Jal Jeevan Mission of the Ministry of Jal Shakti aims to provide tap water connection to every rural home by 2024. The work under this mission is being done on war footing and the mission gives a lot of emphasis on water quality surveillance and monitoring. Taking cognizance of the pressing need for water testing, Govt. of Haryana has come up with a novel approach by launching a State of the Art Mobile Water Testing Laboratory Van, fully equipped with multi-parameter system containing analyzers/ sensor/ probes/ instruments meant for water testing. Water Quality in State of Haryana is mainly affected by constituents like total dissolved solids (TDS), Fluoride, nitrate, iron and alkalinity.

There have been 44 cases of COVID-19 reported this year where the transmission is thought to have come from a flight journey.
 According to heads at the International Air Transport Association (IATA), contracting the deadly respiratory disease on board a plane should be put in the same category of likelihood as ‘being struck by lightning’.
 “With just 44 published cases of potential inflight COVID-19 transmission among 1.2 billion travellers, the risk of contracting the virus on board appears to be in the same category as being struck by lightning,” said Alexandre de Juniac, CEO of IATA.
 Dr David Powell, IATA’s medical advisor, said: “The risk of a passenger contracting COVID-19 while on-board appears very low. With only 44 identified potential cases of flight-related transmission among 1.2 billion travellers, that’s one case for every 27 million travellers.”
 Taking it a step further, you’re more likely to win the lottery (one in 14 million) than IATA claims you are likely to contract COVID-19 on a flight (one case in every 27 million).
 “We recognise that this may be an underestimate but even if 90 percent of the cases were unreported, it would be one case for every 2.7 million travellers. We think these figures are extremely reassuring. Furthermore, the vast majority of published cases occurred before the wearing of face coverings inflight became widespread,” added Powell.
 Prior to the pandemic, the aviation sector provided more than 6.2 million jobs and US$56 billion in GDP in Africa and 2.4 million jobs and $130 billion in GDP in the Middle East.
 It’s estimated the colossal effect of COVID-19 on air traffic could equate to 3.5 million job losses and a $35 billion drop in GDP for Africa, and 1.5 million jobs lost and an $85 billion drop for the Middle East.

Mortgage lenders want to make sure you earn enough money to cover your loan payments, so the higher your paycheck, the more confidence they'll have. Of course, you can't just march into your boss's office and demand a raise on the spot, but you can consider getting a second job temporarily so you're able to show a higher income. To be clear, you can't just do that job for a month and call it quits. Your lender will want proof that the income you claim to earn is stable and consistent. But if you're willing to make the effort, you may have an easier time not just getting a mortgage, but keeping up with mortgage payments.

Like many topics I’ve covered in this column, technologies developed for other industries often find applications in food and beverage. Take, for example, breweries having to pump spent grain—usually caked up—to silos or storage tanks. The stuff plugs up piping and pumps. Been there, done that, however, for sewage. In fact, SEEPEX had already invented a solution for sewage handling where sludge with 20% to 40% dry matter content needs to be pumped over distances up to 1,000 meters.
 The company was recently awarded a patent for its Smart Air Injection (SAI) technology, which involves pulsing compressed air into a progressive cavity (PC) pump, giving the sludge a push in the right direction. Open-hopper SAI systems with smart conveying technology reduce maintenance time by up to 85% with maintain-in-place, requiring no disassembly of discharge piping.

What makes PepsiCo a real standout right now, however, is the adaptation it's also making with respect to consumerism in 2020 and beyond. In May it unveiled PantryShop.com and Snacks.com as a means of selling snack foods and breakfast food directly to consumers that want to steer clear of stores. It's a small part of a much bigger e-commerce evolution the company put into high gear last year, starting with more data analytics and most recently leading to the creation of a new chief strategy and transformation officer role that includes leading PepsiCo's "digitalization and data strategy."
