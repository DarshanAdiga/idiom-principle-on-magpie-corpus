"We're always searching for guys that can play eight guys on the defensive line. We really base it mostly off of our loaf system and the hustle system. If a guy comes in and he plays 25 plays but a third of his plays are loafs, we will decrease his reps until he can play at the level we need him to play at in terms of his hustle and his hitting and his execution. That's across the board. When a guy shows that he can be on our all-hustle team, which is a 90 percent hustle grade, then he can play as many plays as he's able to execute. There are guys in there that are doing that. Grover Stewart does a great job. (Al-Quadin) Muhammad does a great job. There are a lot of guys in there. (DeForest Buckner) Buck does a great job of hustling every single play and those guys are on the all-hustle team every single week. That's what we're searching for.

The Virginia House of Delegates and Senate this week both passed a revised state budget that would fund various criminal justice and police reform measures, housing relief, assistance with utility payments and aid to public schools.
 The budget bills from the House and Senate — both of which are controlled by Democrats — have numerous differences. A group of delegates and senators will discuss those over the coming days so they can put forward a final budget for both chambers to approve.
 The special session has been going on for seven weeks, and it's unclear when it will end because of the lack of an efficient plan between the House and Senate. Meanwhile, law enforcement, courts, utility companies, school divisions and Virginians are waiting to see what relief lawmakers provide through the budget. The Senate passed its budget Friday; the House passed its version Tuesday.

Russian journalists who cover Putin have not seen him up close since March. The few people who meet him face-to-face generally spend as much as two weeks in quarantine first. The president still conducts his meetings with senior officials — including with his Cabinet and his Security Council — by video link from a spartan room in his residence outside Moscow, which has been outfitted with Izranova’s disinfectant tunnel.
 In the coronavirus pandemic, Putin’s Russia has often been compared to the United States and Brazil, two other large countries whose leaders have played down the disease’s risk and saw it spiral out of control. But while President Donald Trump and President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil have chafed against restricting their own movements, Putin has retreated into an intricate cocoon of social distancing — even as he has allowed life in Russia to essentially return to normal.
 The contrast between the behavior of Putin and that of his people now looms large, as a second wave of the pandemic threatens to wash over Russia. In Moscow, where people packed indoor bars and restaurants all summer with few masks in sight, the number of daily reported new cases tripled to more than 2,300 in the last two weeks.
 As Russia lifted last spring’s lockdown, Putin presided over ceremonial events that seemed designed to exude a sense of normalcy. Behind the scenes, they were anything but normal.
 Dozens of World War II veterans joined Putin on the risers in Red Square in June when he presided over a military parade commemorating the 75th anniversary of the Soviet Union’s victory over Nazi Germany. But before being allowed within breathing distance of Putin, the veterans had to spend two weeks in quarantine at an isolated health resort.
 “We went for walks, were bored, sat around and breathed the air,” said Lev Litvinov, a 100-year-old veteran.
 The logistics proved so taxing that Litvinov did not actually make it to the parade. He said that after spending two weeks in quarantine, he got sick on the winding drive through the countryside toward Red Square, 50 miles away. He was taken instead to a health center, where he spent another week.
 “Most importantly, this is about their health, the veterans' health,” Dmitri S. Peskov, Putin’s spokesperson, said in June of the decision to quarantine the attendees.

First, the background. Even before the coronavirus, good employment numbers could hide underlying economic weakness. For at least the past decade, we’ve been living in a world of excess savings: the amount the private sector saves persistently exceeds the amount it spends on real investments. This savings glut is reflected in low interest rates, even when the economy is strong.
 Low interest rates, in turn, limit the ability of the Federal Reserve to fight downturns, which is why Jerome Powell, the Fed’s chairman, has been pleading for more fiscal stimulus.
 In today’s world, then, we actually want the government to run budget deficits because they put excess savings to use. But we also want those deficits to be productive — to boost investment and strengthen the economy in the long run.
 The 2017 Trump tax cut flunked that test. It increased the budget deficit, but the main driver of that red ink — a huge cut in corporate taxes — utterly failed to yield the promised surge in business investment.

A. David Paltiel, a professor of public health policy and management at the Yale School of Medicine who was an author of a study recommending twice-a-week testing, called the mixed messages from the Trump administration and the CDC “an unmitigated disaster” that had confused college officials.
 One thing that is working has been the partnership between the Broad Institute and more than 100 colleges in New England, which are testing students frequently and paying $25 to $30 per test to have the samples processed overnight at the institute’s lab in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
 The program has allowed Colby College, with about 2,000 students on its rural Maine campus, to test each student before and after arrival on campus, then twice weekly thereafter, using a nasal swab PCR test that takes less than three minutes to conduct. Faculty and staff are also tested twice weekly. So far, the campus has had 11 positive tests, a few of which turned out to be false positives, said David Greene, the school’s president.
 In one case, the testing identified a student who had apparently caught the coronavirus on the way to campus and did not have a sufficient viral load to test positively upon entry. By the time the infection was caught in the next round of testing two days later, contact tracing revealed that a roommate had been infected.
 “It could have been 150 people, and we kept it to one person,” Greene said.
 At Wesleyan University, another Broad Institute partner, twice-weekly testing has helped tamp down the infection rate both on and off the Middletown, Connecticut, campus. With nine positive tests in more than six weeks, Wesleyan’s president, Michael S. Roth, said the 2,900 students in campus housing could now move freely between the campus and the town.
 “Size does matter,” Roth said, noting his is a small campus in a small city where bars “are on a short leash.” Wesleyan also lacks the level of Greek life that has led to outbreaks at larger institutions.
 At Delaware State University, a historically Black college with about 1,800 of its 5,000 students living on campus this semester, partnerships with the nonprofit Testing for America and the Thurgood Marshall College Fund, among other nonprofit groups, have enabled twice-weekly testing. That, in turn, has freed the school to offer some classes in person, and to continue housing on campus hundreds of vulnerable or low-income students who might have had nowhere else to go, Tony Allen, the school’s president, said.
 Less than 1% of tests have turned up positive, and none have been the result of community spread on campus. “There’s a heightened sensitivity here and at other HBCUs in other parts of the country because of the disproportionate impact the pandemic is having on the community,” he said.
 Some larger schools with their own testing programs also are keeping rates down. Duke tested every student upon arrival, weeding out some positive cases before they could get onto campus, said a university spokesman, Michael Schoenfeld.

It is the first update to the manual in eight years, and it reflects growing scientific evidence that peak physical performance includes more than just physical training.
 “The goal of the Holistic Health and Fitness System is to build physical lethality and mental toughness to win quickly and return home healthy,” the introduction tells readers.
 The manual also has updates on running techniques to avoid injury, and a section on the importance of spirituality, with entries on meditation, journaling and how the “act of serving others” helps some soldiers realize the “interconnectedness of all things and people.”
 That is a conversation that Private Bailey never had with Sarge.
 To promote good sleep, the manual warns soldiers to avoid video games, texting and other screen activity before bed, and recommends winding down by “listening to soothing music, reading, or taking a warm shower or bath” instead. It also says to avoid alcohol before sleep.
 The new guidance comes as the military has become increasingly aware that chronic sleep deprivation during missions can cripple decision-making and lead to disaster. The Navy recently overhauled sleep schedules at sea after determining that fatigue was a factor in two fatal warship collisions.
 During deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan, commanders often failed to prioritize sleep. Changing schedules, long duty shifts and overnight missions led to chronic fatigue that fueled a voracious dependency on energy drinks, which left many troops feeling frazzled. Army research found that soldiers who guzzled energy drinks had higher levels of mental health problems, which can make it harder to deal with the stresses of missions.
 “The Army has always had an internal dynamic that real men don’t need sleep and can just push on, and it’s incredibly stupid,” said Lt. Gen. David Barno, who was commander of combined forces in Afghanistan from 2003 to 2005. “Combat is a thinking man’s business, and your brain doesn’t function without sleep.”

WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump was headed to the hospital Friday after he and first lady Melania Trump tested positive for COVID-19, raising fresh questions about the president's health.
   
 Trump, 74, was going to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Md., in what aides said was a precautionary move. Officials said they expected him to be there for a few days.
   
 White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany said the president "remains in good spirits, has mild symptoms, and has been working throughout the day."
   
 "Out of an abundance of caution, and at the recommendation of his physician and medical experts, the President will be working from the presidential offices at Walter Reed for the next few days. President Trump appreciates the outpouring of support for both he and the First Lady," she added.
   
 The president's diagnosis, which he tweeted just before 1 a.m. on Friday, sent shockwaves through Washington and across the country, causing markets to plummet just weeks before the presidential election.
   
 The president received a single 8 gram dose of Regeneron's polyclonal antibody cocktail as a precautionary measure, according to a memo from White House physician Dr. Sean Conley. The antibody cocktail is being studied in four late-stage clinical trials and its safety and efficacy have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority, the company said on its page.
   
 The president also has been taking zinc, vitamin D, famotidine, melatonin and a daily aspirin, Conley said.
   
 "As of this afternoon, the President remains fatigued but in good spirits," Conley said, according to the memo.
   
 Conley said the first lady was experiencing only a "mild cough and headache." He added that other members of the president's family are well and tested negative for COVID-19.
   
 Trump has not posted to his Twitter account since announcing his diagnosis, an uncharacteristic move for a president who frequently tweets and retweets throughout the day.
   
 "We're having to hold him back a little here because he is hard at work," White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany told Fox News on Friday afternoon.
   
 When asked whether Trump would address the nation about his health in the coming days, McEnany said: "It's safe to say that you'll be seeing and hearing from the president as he moves forward with his working schedule."
   
 Trump revealed his test results after his one of his closest advisers, Hope Hicks, who joined the president on a series of recent trips, had been infected. Hicks began feeling symptoms on a return flight from the president's rally in Minnesota on Wednesday and was isolated from other passengers on the plane.
   
 White House officials knew Hicks tested positive before Trump traveled to his golf resort in Bedminster, N.J., to attend a fundraiser Thursday, Meadows confirmed.
   
 "I can tell you in terms of Hope Hicks, we discovered that right as Marine One was taking off yesterday," Meadows said.
   
 He added that some people who had been traveling and in close contact with Hicks were removed from the flight, raising questions about why the president proceeded with the fundraiser, which saw him come in contact with dozens of supporters.
   
 Vice President Mike Pence and second lady Karen Pence both tested negative. Former Vice President Joe Biden and his wife Jill Biden announced they also tested negative after coming into contact with the president at Tuesday's first presidential debate in Cleveland, Ohio.
   
 Officials said presidents have a suite of offices at Walter Reed, and doctors recommended that Trump use it as a precaution in light of his positive COVID test.
   
 Aides insisted the president is fine, walking around and talking, and that this is a precautionary move.
   
 If the president should need a procedure and becomes incapacitated, he will temporarily cede authority to Vice President Mike Pence, who tested negative for COVID-19 earlier on Friday.
   
 Section 3 of the 25th Amendment to the Constitution, which lays out succession should the president become incapacitated, has only been invoked three times since it was adopted in 1967.
   
 Former President Ronald Reagan invoked it when he had surgery to remove a cancerous polyp in his large intestine in 1985 and George W. Bush twice used it when he underwent routine colonoscopies.
   
 At 74, the president is five times more likely to be hospitalized and 90 times more likely to die of COVID-19 than someone between the ages of 18 and 29, according to the CDC.

"You definitely do want to get into the open field and let your legs go, but I think we did a great job – not we did, the guys in the running back group – when I got here they were explaining like, 'Hey, this is a new level of football now. So you're going to have your opportunity.' But I kind of alluded to it earlier – when you see it, you have to hit it otherwise that's your opportunity right there. You know it's that much tougher to get out in the open field and when you get out into the open field, you have to make it count. It's definitely an adjustment but you have to understand, it's big-boy football now. Four yards or better is acceptable, but you definitely want to get out into that open field and kind of show your talents." — Colts running back Jonathan Taylor on his eagerness to break out into a long run after having 19 rushes of 40 or more yards in college at Wisconsin, but zero so far in three games in Indy.

“Benjamin feels like—I’m going to get eaten alive for saying this—a regression for her to me. Benjamin is the perfect man on paper that Midge would have looked for in a previous life. I don’t think that’s enough for her now. I think she and Joel are soul mates, but I don’t think they should be together. I think they will never again be able to be on the same page at the same time. They’re having individual journeys that will always be intertwined because they share children, but I’m Team Midge. I’m happy to see Midge go it alone for a minute and figure out who she is. She knew exactly who she was before, and then everything blew up. I think she’s still figuring out who she is now and who she wants to be.”

Specifically about wearing masks and socially distancing from other people and washing our hands.”

With almost every other Android smartphone now shipping with a high refresh rate display, the lack of it on the iPhone 12 lineup might stick out like a sore thumb for many. However, the addition of a high-refresh rate panel has led to a decline in the battery life of most flagship Android devices this year as well. If Apple ends up going with a variable refresh rate panel on the iPhone 13 lineup, it would avoid such pitfalls.

With Trump it can be hard to know, and it’s hard to know whether his own defiance was a kind of wishful thinking about the coronavirus' true prevalence, a reflection of his belief in his own physical invincibility, some combination of the two or none of the above.
 But it’s easy to identify the morals of this story.
 The most obvious one is that the coronavirus has not gone away and there is no guarantee, contrary to the president’s sunny prophecies, that it’s going away anytime soon, certainly not if we’re cavalier about it.
 Which brings up another moral, also obvious but apparently necessary to articulate: There is real risk in being cavalier. The president is now the embodiment of that. The first lady, too. Also Hope Hicks, one of his closest advisers, and who knows how many others in his immediate circle? That question exists because, from the start, there has been a culture of cavalier attitudes and behavior at the White House when it comes to the coronavirus.
 That culture was on flabbergasting display during those evening briefings that the president used to do, the ones that he used primarily to congratulate himself and his administration on their fantabulous job battling the pandemic. They battled it all way to America’s exceptional status as the world leader in recorded cases of, and deaths associated with, the coronavirus.
 That culture was evident in the rallies that the president arranged and insisted on doing over recent weeks. That culture persisted on Thursday, when, according to an article by Peter Baker and Maggie Haberman in The Times, Kayleigh McEnany, maskless, held a briefing with reporters _after_ Hicks' infection with the virus was confirmed and _after_ McEnany was on a plane with her and exposed to her.
 I read that and I winced and I gasped and then I wondered why in the world I was wincing and gasping when it was par for the course. When it was business as usual. When it was an explanation for why we are where we are as a county and why Trump is where he is as a president and patient.
 It is time, at long last, to learn. To be smarter. To be safer. To be more responsible, to others as well as to ourselves. We cannot erase the mistakes made in America’s response to the coronavirus but we can vow not to continue making them, and the way to treat Trump’s diagnosis is as a turning point and a new start. This is when we woke up.
