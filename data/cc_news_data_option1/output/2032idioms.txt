Si attende l'ordinanza del sindaco Roberti che dovrebbe uscire nella giornata di oggi ma sembrerebbe che il primo cittadino voglia correre ai ripari dopo la movida sfrenata che ha visto centinaia di giovani lungo Corso Nazionale nella giornata di sabato. Le foto e i video che hanno fatto il giro dei social e che hanno mostrato il lato peggiore della movida post Covid non sono piaciute al primo cittadino che, quindi, ha deciso di usare il "pugno duro". L'ordinanza è stata firmata questa mattina, lunedì 25 maggio, dopo essere stata anticipata già dalla giornata di ieri e di fatto contiene delle limitazioni che nascono con l'obiettivo di evitare assembramenti di giovani "senza regola" tra le strade di Termoli e, di conseguenza, anche limitare la possibilità di contagio che farebbe risalire la curva. Una ipotesi che nessuno si può permettere ad una settimana dalla riapertura dei confini regionali, necessaria anche ad assicurare una boccata d'ossigeno alle attività commerciali che "vivono" del turismo extra regionale come stabilimenti balneari e attività di ristorazione ed alberghiere. E così Roberti ha deciso di regolamentare la movida che ha vissuto momenti di "esasperazione" nella notte di sabato con centinaia di giovani in giro, in buona parte senza mascherina e senza l'applicazione di quel distanziamento sociale necessario ad evitare il contagio. Si sarebbe verificato anche un episodio di rissa in piazzetta, luogo di ritrovo dei ragazzi, ma all'arrivo del 118 i sanitari non avrebbero trovato nessuno da medicare sul posto. Resta lo sconcerto a Termoli per episodi ed atti che hanno lasciato l'amaro in bocca in chi, invece, sta cercando di evitare a tutti i costi il contagio.

Incidents of cross-border terrorism are continuing as usual on the Western front and hence, the exchange of sweets did not take place at any location along the India-Pakistan international border from Jammu to Gujarat, the officials said.
 The BSF guards this border.
 The force, the officials said, had attempted to undertake the customary gesture during Diwali last year, on its raising day (December 1) and Republic Day (January 26), but the move was not reciprocated by the Pakistani side.
 However, the force exchanged sweets with its Bangladeshi counterpart, Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB), all along the eastern front.
 India and Bangladesh share a 4,096-km-long international border.
 "BSF and BGB share a very cordial relationship. Both the countries share a similar culture, traditions and festivals.
 "The warmth and bonding between the countries and border-guarding forces reflect during several occasions, when they share the joy of festivals, including during Eid," a statement issued by the south Bengal frontier of the BSF said.
 This frontier guards 903 kms of the India-Bangladesh border and is headquartered in Kolkata.
 "BSF troops up to the border post level conveyed their best wishes to their companions of Bangladesh. The pleasantries for BGB headquarters were shared at Petrapole (land-border crossing in West Bengal)," the statement said.
 The BSF, during these events, convey its best wishes and good health to its partner, the BGB, with a hope of a better future ahead, it added.

White House Cybersecurity Coordinator Howard Schmidt said the administration continues to work with industry on how to work together to combat cyber crimes and protect infrastructure and that he expects the cybersecurity package, whose reporting requirements have troubled some companies, would change with give and take over those concern.      He also said that protecting privacy and civil liberties would continue to be a "core tenet."      Asked in an interview for C-SPAN's Communicators program about pushback from telecom companies -- the White House submitted proposed cybersecurity legislation that included information sharing (as in reporting requirements) with critical infrastructure (broadband providers among others) -- Schmidt took issue with the suggestion that some had come out with "guns blazing" on the proposed new laws.      He said most of the people he had talked to said the White House proposal was "measured," and added that it was "the beginning of the dialog" rather than the end of it.      He conceded that the "devil was in the details," and said that it was yet to be determined just exactly what critical infrastructure would be defined as and what the reporting requirements would be. He said that includes making sure that if a company already has a reporting requirement to some government agency "that we are not piling more reporting requirements on top of them.      Schmidt said that was one of the concerns he had heard from the private sector and one the White House shared since it wanted to make sure that IT growth continued to be spurred. He said he expected further input from private sector. "I would think that as this moves forward there will be more input from the private-sector and as Congress coalesces on the details, we anticipate changes."      Schmidt said among the cyber issues the government is playing catch-up on include penalties for cybercrime and the impact on organized crime. "We recognize there is some ground we have to make up."      Protecting cybersecurity and online privacy were among the reasons FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski gave for needing to clarify the FCC's Internet authority via new network neutrality rules.      On the issue of privacy, Schmidt said Freedom of Speech and expression remain core tenets. He pointed out that the president had a dedicated privacy officer looking at those areas. He said they wanted to have controls in place to protect privacy and civil liberties and that it was something he was accountable for.      Schmidt defended the major role of the Department of Homeland Security in the administration's cybersecurity plan even though it is a relatively new agency and others, like NSA, have had much more experience with it, He said that was the best agency to work with the private sector. "I have confidence in the leadership," he said.      He took issue with the characterization of asking private industry to deal with cybersecurity as like having the airlines deal with air attacks. Schmidt said building security into systems has become a business imperative. "They have an inherent need to do that to make their businesses successful. Businesses don't make money if their products can't be sold securely."      He conceded some companies have been slow to the table about realizing and that part of the government's role is to help them understand they have that shared responsibility.      He said the government wants to know how prepared critical infrastructure is to deal with attacks, and what they are going to do to fix any vulnerabilities. He said smart lawyers are figuring out when an attack constitutes an act of war that demands a military response. That is why he said it was important for the government to have information on attacks and how they were being dealt with.      Schmidt said he thought cybersecurity legislation would pass in the next few months and that there would be renewed activity after Congress gets back. As with everything else, that issue has taken a back seat in the past weeks to the debt ceiling negotiations.

NEW YORK (AP) — Memorial Day in New York City is being marked with car convoys and small ceremonies instead of parades, as those looking to honor fallen military members have to contend with coronavirus restrictions.
 “It's something we're upset about, but we understand," said Raymond Aalbue, chairman of the United Military Veterans of Kings County, which usually puts on a parade in Brooklyn.
 There's “no reason to put anybody in harm's way," he said. Still, “it's really cutting quick to the heart of all the veterans."
 His organization will have a convoy of 10 cars leaving from the Bay Ridge spot where the parade usually starts and then ending up at the Brooklyn veterans affairs hospital, where participants will line up next to their cars for a salute and a wreath-laying ceremony.
 In Queens, the group behind the Little Neck-Douglaston Memorial Day Parade will have a few people at the site where they normally end their parade, said executive director Victor Mimoni.
 One person will lay a wreath, another will do a flag ceremony and a third will play “Taps" while some others watch, he said, a far cry from the crowds that usually attend the event.
 But “we felt the need to do something," Mimoni said.
 On Staten Island, another convoy of cars, led by motorcycles, will take off in a procession after a wreath-laying ceremony at Hero Park.
 In Manhattan, there will be a private ceremony at the Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum featuring a ceremonial wreath-laying and the playing of “Taps" that will be recorded and broadcast online Monday afternoon.

I do not find posting of anonymous comments on online fora of any real value. But they are generally a useful Barometer with which to gauge the MOOD of the nation. Given, there will always be extremist contributions, "submissions" probably a better word for most - judging from their tone. Yes, trading in vulgar and vitriolic diatriabe on Internet fora isn't a way forward, but views like Reason's need a rebuttal such as the one I've posted previously. Which confirms just how sad a LOT we Zimbabweans are. Having been at the UZ in the 90s - I can't confirm this to you with a certainity! I recall brainless tribal battles at Campus.

Barbie, Kotex and Harley-Davidson are among the brands that are having a major impact on women, according to a new analysis of brand performance by Women at NBCU.
 Women at NBCU is an ad sales, marketing and research initiative set up to help advertisers reach female consumers via NBCU's TV and digital assets.
 As part of its efforts to come up with better ways for advertisers to target women, Women at NBCU has developed a Brand Power Index (BPI) to track brands that garner the most female attention and it used BPI to track brands having the most impact on women over the last year.
 Many of the most successful brands found innovative ways to combine digital media and more traditional media to reach women.
 The Women at NBCU's BPI review included an analysis of 500 brands based on a compilation of online search data from Compete, social media buzz data from New Media Strategies, and person-to-person conversations tracked by Keller Fay Group. Brands were tracked over the course of a year from July 1, 2010, to June 30, 2011.
 The study spotlighted Frito-Lay in the "best social media buzz" category. Frito-Lay set the Guiness World Record on Facebook this spring with 1.5 million new "likes" in 24 hours, climbing 159 points up the index.
 To achieve this feat, Frito-Lay partnered with Zynga to create a Frito-Lay farm on FarmVille, where players could harvest and package their own wholesome virtual goods. Frito-Lay also replicated its famous "Flavor Kitchen" in New York's Times Square, a live cooking demonstration with simple solutions for busy moms, which was simultaneously streamed on Frito-Lay's Facebook page.
 In the "best breakthrough buzz" category, the traditionally male-associated brand Harley-Davidson landed a spot on the index for the first time by staging a series of initiatives to celebrate the growing number of women enthusiasts. The company also gave women the chance to interact with fellow female riders on a new website.
 In the "best steady buzz" category, Women at NBCU highlighted CVS Pharmacy, which had the longest steady buzz, climbing eight consecutive months up the index. The company captured women's attention with its continued effort to diversify beyond the pharmacy category, focusing especially on lifestyle and beauty.
 In the "best controversial buzz" area, Kotex landed on top. It jumped 130 notches up the index "when it got real with women this spring by breaking the silence around feminine care," the Women at NBCU reported.
 The brand launched "U by Kotex Tween," a new line of feminine care products aimed at 8- to 12-year-olds. As part of that effort it created an online forum for girls and their mothers to speak candidly about women's health at www.Kotex.com/Tween, as well as a space to recount their first periods.
 Barbie won the "best viral buzz" segment with a successful social media campaign over whether Barbie should take Ken back or remain a single, independent woman. Mattel flirted with the idea across Facebook, Foursquare, Twitter and Youtube to determine if America's most famous couple should reunite. The company also launched _Genuine Ken_ , a reality web series, to find the next "great American boyfriend."
 The Barbie and Ken love saga also continued offline, with a billboard campaign in which Ken professes his love for Barbie.
 "The most successful brands we've seen over the last twelve months not only engaged women across multiple platforms, but also created the opportunity for women to engage with one another and contribute to the brand conversation," concluded Melissa Lavigne-Delville, VP of trends and strategic insights, Integrated Media at NBCUniversal, in a statement summarizing the results. "It was these brands that took risks, redefined their category, experimented with social media, and made room for humor in their messaging, that really climbed the Index."

met with Maharashtra Governor B S Koshyari at Raj Bhavan here.The NCP claimed that the meeting took place on the invitation of the governor and no political issues came up for discussion.Speaking to reporters after leaving Raj Bhavan, senior NCP leader Praful Patel said it was a courtesy meeting at the request of Koshyari.When asked whether Pawar and the governor discussed any political issues, Patel said, It was a routine meeting between them. It was not about any particular political issue or topic.However, the timing of the meeting is significant as it took place against the backdrop of strained relations between the Shiv Sena, which heads the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government of which the NCP is one of the key constituents, and the Raj Bhavan.Pawar was one of the key leaders from Maharashtra who had openly complained about Koshyaris intervention in the functioning of the state administration.Recently, the governor had taken a strong objection to a letter written by state Higher and Technical Education Minister Uday Samant to the University Grants Commission, recommending cancellation of final year university exams.In a letter to Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, Koshyari had said that not conducting the final year examinations by universities amounts to breach of UGC guidelines. He also asked Thackeray to issue suitable instructions to Samant for his unwarranted intervention.Earlier in the day, an editorial published in the Sena mouthpiece Saamana slammed the governor for being in favour of conducting final year university exams in the state, and said health of students cannot be put at risk amid the COVID- 19 crisis.The Sena had also expressed its displeasure with Raj Bhavan over frequent meetings between Opposition BJP and the governor.Opposition leader Devendra Fadnavis had recently complained to the governor about the failure of the Thackeray government in handling the COVID crisis.Last week, Thackeray, who heads the Sena, had skipped a meeting called by Koshyari to take stock of the situation.Earlier, the Sena had criticised Koshyari when he did not act on the Maharashtra Cabinets recommendation in April to nominate Uddhav Thackeray as member of the state Legislative Council from the governors quota.Thackeray was eventually elected unopposed to the Upper House earlier this month.(This story has not been edited by Business Standard staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

In the ever-changing world of information technology and cutting-edge manufacturing, timing is everything. Companies, with technologically sophisticated products and services, suddenly can find their offerings obsolete and employees with job skills no longer in demand.
   
 Burlington's Ted Brown rode this merry-go-round of boom-and-bust for a large part of his professional life until he opted to step back to see if there was a career outside the East Coast tech corridor that might offer a more rewarding life.
   
 That decision brought him back to his hometown, where a fortunate set of circumstances led him to a new and rewarding career as director of Burlington's Southeast Iowa Regional Airport.
   
 Brown's journey to the IT industry and a job in aviation began with a decision made as a member of the Burlington High School Class of 1980. Back then, he decided to use his math and science skills to pursue an engineering career.
   
 That first move away from Burlington led him to Iowa State University, where he earned a degree in Industrial Engineering. And his career path seemed set.
   
 In the mid-1980s, engineering graduates were in high demand and recruiters came calling to the Iowa State campus. Brown looked over the job market and opted to work for Eastman Kodak in distant Rochester, New York -- about 350 miles west of New York City.
   
 "At first, it definitely required a period of adjustment," the soft-spoken engineer now remembers. "I was coming from a small Midwestern town and going to work for a company with 60,000 workers, and I was in an engineering department with perhaps 125 other engineers."
   
 Eastman Kodak then was a leader in the manufacture of photographic film and equipment and their success seemed secure. With arrival of digital photography came Eastman's downhill slide.
   
 Brown's manufacturing engineering duties evolved while he was with Eastman, and he moved into an information systems development department, working in quality assurance. But Brown could see his company was changing, so he moved to burnish his marketable skills.
   
 He enrolled at the prestigious Rochester Institute of Technology and earned masters degrees in Information Technology and Software Development Management. However, even these additional skills could not forestall the inevitable.
   
 "It was during this period, up to 1998, that the company employment dropped to 23,000. And eventually they got to me and I was let go," Brown said. "Here I was in Rochester with no job and the town has some of the worst weather imaginable.
   
 "I began looking for a job, but there was not much in Rochester with the slowdown at Eastman. But I had a friend that had moved to northern Virginia to work for America On Line (AOL) and he suggested I come down there to see what I could find."
   
 Brown's skills were in demand and he soon found employment with a number of companies working on government contracts. But the relocation from icy Rochester was not without its problems.
   
 "There is a problem when you are working for a government contract company and that is, when the contract is finished, there may not be any more work and the company has to get rid of its employees. That happened to me a couple of times. It was getting pretty stressful.
   
 "I was working for one company that was developing power supplies for the semi-conductor industry and then came the dot com crash and that job went away. I also went to work for a web development firm and found myself writing code in FORTRAN and that really took me back. But I didn't want to be a 'coder.' I was a project manger and that was what I was good at."
   
 The lack of job security was eating at Brown, and there were other aspects of life in the large cities that were bothering him.
   
 "The traffic congestion was indescribable" he reported. "If you wanted to go anywhere, run the simplest errands, it took forever.
   
 "There was just too much growth and too many people. It was becoming a place just for young people and I no longer was that young. I had to get back to the Midwest where there was more space and a more relaxed life style."
   
 Brown began the return to his Midwest roots in 2018, when he left the Virginia area to stay with family on the outskirts of Chicago. From this base he began his search for a job in a smaller town, ideally along the Mississippi River of his childhood.
   
 A break in that search came when an acquaintance he met at Iowa Work Force Development noticed an advertisement in the Burlington newspaper for an airport manger. He applied and everything came together for a job where he can use his program manager skills and in a community he was fond of.
   
 "The only second thoughts I might have had was on the day I first got to the airport. Burlington was having a late spring snow storm and here I was touring around the airport in a maintenance truck, thinking the weather was just like I escaped in Rochester," Brown laughed. "But, fortunately it didn't last long."
   
 Brown still is in the process of getting reacquainted with his old home town, and it seems to be going well.
   
 "I'm getting to know old friends. I'm looking forward to joining some of the civic clubs and getting involved with the Burlington Partnership. I'm going to do all those things I couldn't do when I was in Washington. It is good to be back."

Syracuse, N.Y. -- Dozens of friends and family gathered Sunday to pay their respects to the family of 33-year-old Arthur Bullock Jr., whose stabbing death Saturday ended the life of a man whose family said he was their “rock.”
 Bullock was killed in an early morning stabbing Saturday on West Onondaga Street. Syracuse police say they are still investigating and have not announced any suspects.
 Bullock, who went by “Art,’’ had worked hard to overcome tragedy and a stint in prison as a young man, said his younger sister, Asia Evans, a second-year law student at Florida A&M University.
 “I never said my brother was perfect,’’ she said. “But he was the best brother I could ask for.”
 In 2009, Bullock, then 22, was indicted along with 11 others in a high-profile gang prosecution in Syracuse. The case was prosecuted by John Katko, then an assistant U.S. attorney, who now represents Central New York in Congress.
 Bullock pleaded guilty to engaging in a pattern of racketeering through his involvement in the 110 Gang. In 2011, he was sentenced to 71 months in federal prison. He was released in 2014.
 In 2013, Bullock Jr. tragically lost his father, Arthur Bullock. He was shot and killed after trying to help two men who were being robbed, Syracuse police said at the time. The elder Bullock was 54 when he was killed.
 In 2017, Bullock Jr. pleaded guilty to three violations of his probation – driving while ability impaired, marijuana use, and associating with a felon -- according to court records. He was sent back to prison for four months and released in January 2018.
 Evans said her brother “definitely was changed’’ after his release from prison. He worked at Dunkin’ Donuts initially and then trained to work in construction to support his family.
 “He took care of my mom. He supported us in every way,’’ Evans said. “It wasn’t always easy. But he was our rock. He was strong.’’
 Clifford Ryans, a distant relative of Bullock and the founder of OGs Against Violence, said Bullock worked as a volunteer to mentor young people. Among other things, he coached basketball at the Southwest Community Center, his sister said.
 “He was doing a lot of good positive things in the community,’’ Ryans said.
 For two days after his killing, friends and family gathered on Barnes Avenue in the Valley neighborhood to mourn with Bullock’s family. Evans estimated 200 had come Sunday to console her mother. The street in front of the family home was still packed with mourners after 9 p.m. Sunday.
 Evans remembers her brother calling her often at law school to offer support and to talk about legal cases.
 “I did well for myself on the back of my brother,’’ she said. “He took care of me. But for him I would not be in law school.”
 Bullock leaves behind two young children, a boy and a girl, Evans said.
 Now family members hope that police find the person who stabbed Bullock. Evans said she hopes that witnesses will come forward to speak with police.
 “That’s the only way we can better our community, is if we help each other,’’ she said.

Hey Oprah, want to pump up that little network of yours? Hey Piers, ready to land that huge get that will cement your position with the big boys (and girls) in America? Hey Katie, how about a splash for your ABC debut?
 Clearly the first Casey Anthony interview – whether from a jailhouse or from anywhere else depending on her sentencing – is the biggest of the gets right now. But that doesn’t mean it’s the only one. A chat with her parents – who issued a pretty terse statement Tuesday following their daughter’s outcome – also would bring an eyeball or three.
 Even the jurors have become legitimate gets after they as a whole declined to speak to reporters after the verdict was announced Tuesday. But that doesn’t mean they won’t be coming to a TV set near you soon.
 The judge who presided over the case is barring the juror’s names from being released at this time, including to the media. But a source on the ground in Orlando said that with all the bookers and agents there in Florida, it was likely their identities would be uncovered.
 And while the news networks might not know much about the jurors, the jurors each have a packet from every media outlet summarizing each network, should they decide to come forward and talk, according to the same source.
 “We absolutely will pursue bookings with the jurors,” said a spokesperson for HLN, which has devoted near 24-hour coverage to the trial.
 Other networks reached for comment about interview deals with the jurors declined to comment on bookings, but one network source said “I don’t know anyone that wouldn’t want to talk to them.”
 It may be that the jurors have just decided not to talk for free. Checkbook journalism has made headlines lately, especially in the highly competitive morning news show bookings game. Most recently, ABC paid to license photos sent by disgraced former Rep. Anthony Weiner to Meagan Broussard before running an exclusive interview with Broussard on _Good Morning America_.
 The jury may have been sequestered for the duration of the six-week trial, but if they’ve been paying attention to the news game, or been advised by anyone who has, they certainly know that when it comes to exclusive interviews – especially of the salacious variety — talk is anything but cheap.

In the English exam held last week, the controversial question described a conversation between two persons, wherein one says he has to opt for a job in Portugal because of jobs being scarce here, and that one needs to have influence and money to get a job.
 Goa Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary School Education Chairman Ramakrishna Samant on Monday said an inquiry would be initiated into how such a question was included in the English paper of the Secondary School Certificate (SSC) exam.
 "We will conduct an inquiry into it immediately, Samant said.
 Goa is a former Portuguese colony. It was liberated from the Portuguese rule in 1961.
 State BJP general secretary Narendra Sawaikar also demanded strict action in the matter.
 "The Goa Board should immediately initiate strict action against the paper setter, moderator and whosoever is involved in the process of this paper setting. This act has to be punished," he tweeted on Sunday.
 Former Goa BJP chief Rajendra Arlekar said the question provokes an "anti-Goa and anti-India feeling".
 Portuguese stooges in Goa Board? Look at question D of English paper of SSCE. Provoking anti-Goa and anti-India feeling. Paper setter must be punished," he tweeted.
 Goa Surakasha Manch (GSM) president Subhash Velingkar said the question "smacks of pro-Portuguese mentality".
 Velingkar, who is the former Goa RSS chief, demanded that the name of the paper setter and the board of studies which approved the question paper be made public.
 He also demanded an inquiry into the matter and action against those found guilty.
 However, Goa Pradesh Congress Committee president Girish Chodankar said the question reflects current reality of the state government.
 No need to change the voice. Message is loud and clear in this question of SSC exam paper. The @BJP4Goa Government under @goacm @DrPramodPSawant is corrupt. Now the 'Defects' are visible even in Education System," he tweeted.

Speaking to reporters after leaving Raj Bhavan, senior NCP leader Praful Patel said it was a courtesy meeting at the request of Koshyari.
 When asked whether Pawar and the governor discussed any political issues, Patel said, "It was a routine meeting between them. It was not about any particular political issue or topic".
 However, the timing of the meeting is significant as it took place against the backdrop of strained relations between the Shiv Sena, which heads the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government of which the NCP is one of the key constituents, and the Raj Bhavan.
 Pawar was one of the key leaders from Maharashtra who had openly complained about Koshyari's "intervention" in the functioning of the state administration.
 Recently, the governor had taken a strong objection to a letter written by state Higher and Technical Education Minister Uday Samant to the University Grants Commission, recommending cancellation of final year university exams.
 In a letter to Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, Koshyari had said that "not conducting the final year examinations by universities amounts to breach of UGC guidelines". He also asked Thackeray to issue suitable instructions to Samant for his "unwarranted intervention".
 Earlier in the day, an editorial published in the Sena mouthpiece 'Saamana' slammed the governor for being in favour of conducting final year university exams in the state, and said health of students cannot be put at risk amid the COVID- 19 crisis.
 The Sena had also expressed its displeasure with Raj Bhavan over "frequent meetings" between Opposition BJP and the governor.
 Opposition leader Devendra Fadnavis had recently complained to the governor about the "failure" of the Thackeray government in handling the COVID crisis.
 Last week, Thackeray, who heads the Sena, had skipped a meeting called by Koshyari to take stock of the situation.
 Earlier, the Sena had criticised Koshyari when he did not act on the Maharashtra Cabinet's recommendation in April to nominate Uddhav Thackeray as member of the state Legislative Council from the governor's quota.
 Thackeray was eventually elected unopposed to the Upper House earlier this month.

Heidi Olson, an ADM 2020 senior from De Soto, felt encouraged and supported with the Adopt a Senior event.
   
 "Someone adopting me was super cool," she said. "It reminded me that we were going to get through this, people were still thinking about us, and that this is a unique experience rather than something horrible and tragic like I was starting to think it was."
   
 Olson felt that getting gifts from the community was unique because it was not just family.
   
 "It also brings light to one of the days we may be sitting in the house!" she said. "It was a nice surprise!"
   
 During her senior year, Olson was involved in large group speech-readers theater. She participated in the fall play as a makeup crew member and was planning to do the same for the spring production.
   
 "It's my second year being in International Thespian Society with a leadership position as the publications manager," Olson said.
   
 She also participated in peer helpers both semesters. She hung out with kids in special education. She cooked with these students, played games, and learned life skills.
   
 "My favorite subjects were probably sociology and yearbook," Olson said. "Sociology, because it really made you think about society and how people act in a different light. It opened my eyes and made me think about how I act and how to communicate best with people or understand them."
   
 She enjoyed yearbook because it was a different approach to a class. She was able to write and use her creativity, which are things she enjoys doing.
   
 "It was kind of fun to be able to tell the story of the school year and make the book that I would look back on in a few years," Olson said. "I got to know a lot of new people through this and be involved in things I wouldn't normally be involved with."
   
 Olson shared special thoughts about her favorite teacher, Mrs. Knipper. She feels that Mrs. Knipper relates well to the students and that she was quick to respond to any emails or questions she had. Mrs. Knipper was Olson's DMACC Intro to Ed teacher.
   
 "She's always trying to go the extra mile to help us out and be there for us," Olson said. "During her explanation videos of assignments, she would dress up in onesies and costumes to lighten the mood, as well as send checkup emails, not related to school, to make sure we were all okay."
   
 When distance learning first happened, Olson was handling it well. She was able to work more, receiving larger paychecks and also do schoolwork. When school was canceled completely, Olson was upset she couldn't see her friends, she couldn't go to the gym, the mall, etc. and it became boring.
   
 "Being a senior, I looked forward to prom, graduating, seeing everyone for the last time, and cleaning out my locker," she said.
   
 After a while, she said distance learning was awful. She was trying to balance two DMACC classes, which were graded, and her regular high school classes remotely. Olson felt her DMACC courses were a lot of work and took a lot of time.
   
 Remaining motivated when school was canceled, was also a challenge for Olson.
   
 "Being at home and stuck inside all the time, all you want to do is get out," Olson said. "And school not being back in session, and being a senior, it felt really pointless and it was hard to focus."
   
 Olson acquired more of the yearbook's responsibilities as people dropped out.
   
 "Trying to get info from people was hard as well, for they felt the same, and barely got on their computer to answer emails I may have sent them," Olson said.
   
 Despite some distance learning negatives, Olson shared her favorite thing from this year. All of her friends that graduated last year, were laughing at this year's graduating senior class back in December and January because they hadn't had many snow days. As a senior, snow days don't have to be made up.
   
 "Little did they know, we got 2+ months off our senior year instead, and they got sent home from college early, which probably rained on many of their parades with them being so excited for freedom. It was a good ha ha moment!" Olson said.
   
 The Adopt a Senior event was a positive experience for Olson and her parents, Julia and Ivan Olson.
   
 "What a great idea! It gave her something to look forward to," her mother Julia said. "Waiting and wondering every day if she would get her gift and the suspense of who adopted her nearly killed her."
   
 Ashley Kuonen and family adopted Olson.
   
 "The Kuonen family used to be our next-door neighbors," Julia said. "They still live close, but a little further down the street now."
   
 Olson felt that the Adopt a Senior event Facebook page brought everyone together. She could see posts from others students that she grew up with, what gifts they got and what their future plans are.
   
 For Olson's Adopt a Senior gift, she received a yellow bath towel with a matching hand towel, which is her favorite color.
   
 "I got face masks and stick on nails, homemade sugar scrub, makeup, bath bomb, and essential oils, which is all fitting to me because I love self-care and they are all things I can use," Olson said. "I got a coloring book with inspirational quotes, a Starbucks gift card to feed my addiction, and a cute little bag that everything was put in!"
   
 She also received a heartfelt note that she said made her day.
   
 Olson is planning to attend Iowa School of Beauty and get a double license as an esthetician and a cosmetologist. She is hoping to start in July.
   
 She said, "Making the page, in general, sparked a community wide effort to help seniors out to make up for a special time in our lives!"

Hungry and exhausted, these migrant workers are arriving at Sonathu and other villages in Bihar's Aurangabad district from places as far-off as Surat, Mumbai, Delhi, Jaipur and Chennai every day, carrying tales of trauma and tribulation.
 But nobody comes to embrace them and all are curtly directed to forlorn government schools and other buildings that pass off as institutional quarantine centres that would be their home for the next 21 days.
 Sonathu gram panchayat, with a population of around 10,000, has already received over 400 migrant workers, its head Poonam Devi told PTI over the phone. The area, about 60 km from state capital Patna, was a naxalite hotbed until a few years ago.
 Every returnee has a story to tell about how they made it back to their village, says Poonam Devi.
 "Coronavirus has forced people to walk through hell to reach heaven (home)," Moti Kumar, who hails from Dhamni village, said after returning from Chennai.
 Kumar and 11 others--a fellow villager and the rest from Banka district-- commenced their daunting journey from Chennai on foot on May 13. It took them nearly 11 days to reach home.
 In the southern metropolis, the migrants from Bihar worked in a factory manufacturing rubber items for cars.
 "Losing our jobs and left with no money to pay for room rent, we started walking towards Bihar. But police drove us back from the Tamil Nadu-Andhra Pradesh border.
 "We were determined to reach home. So we sneaked our way through a forest and reached a national highway," Kumar, who is now in home quarantine, said.
 Kumar's group hitched rides on trucks to reach Jharkhand, from where they again set out on foot, and finally reached their village.
 His relative Gyanendra Kumar Singh said every day they see people trundling down the roads lugging suitcases and bundles clanking with utensils, betraying their migrant status.
 Satyendra Kumar, an advocate and social worker based in Daudnagar in the district, said 16 young men recently pedalled over 1,000 km from Delhi to reach their homes.
 At least 1,200 returnees have been housed in four quarantine centres in Daudnagar sub-division, he said.
 Some worked in cloth mills in Gujarat, while others were engaged in carpet making in Jaipur. Those in Delhi worked as masons and also in cable manufacturing units, Kumar said.
 All of them have managed to escape hunger and hoplessness in cities they had made their home. These cities, bustling with commercial activity and throbbing with life, fed their dreams of a better future that their tiny, somnolent villages cannot offer.
 Poonam Devi said jobs under MGNREGA and agricultural activity that are far less paying are their only options.
 "While the returnees are still in quarantine centres, their families have started approaching us for jobs under MGNREGA," she said.
 Satyendra Kumar said under the state government's instructions, MGNREGA job cards have been readied for 1,100 of the 1,200 returnees housed in the quarantine centres in Daudnagar.
 Many of these migrants were earning between Rs 10,000 and Rs 15,000 a month outside Bihar.
 Shafalta Singh, a college principal and resident of Dhamni village, said, "These are difficult times but our village has the culture of accommodating everybody."

"You have to wait and watch to know more about season two. I don't want to divulge too much but let's just say it's quite possible. It's too early to talk about it but yes if Amazon is willing to do it, definitely there will be a second season, Anushka told PTI in an email interview.
 "We have always stayed true to stories that we want to tell and we will continue to do that. We hope for similar appreciation in the future as well, the actor, who has produced the show with her brother Karnesh via their banner Clean Slate Filmz, said.
 The nine-episode neo-noir series, centred on a Delhi Police inspector who uncovers a sinister plot while trying to solve the assassination attempt on a popular TV journalist, has been lauded for its deep-dive exploration of the caste, class, gender and religious faultlines in the country through an investigative story.
 Anushka, who first worked with Sudip on her production debut, the critically- acclaimed film NH10, said she trusts the writer immensely and they make a good team.
 Sudip's first film as a writer was NH10'. So we go back a long way and he's like a brother to me. I believe in everything he writes because he is such an economical writer. He is somebody who will tell you the most complicated things in the simplest manner and most entertaining fashion and I think that is his greatest strength as a writer, the actor said, adding that she was happy that they have done some of their best work together.
 There is a marked difference in the kind of projects she has backed as a producer, be it road thriller NH10, horror fantasy film Pari or now Paatal Lok.
 They are darker and edgier compared to her films, fantasy comedy "Phillauri" being the exception.
 Anushka said that has been deliberate on their part as they want to be associated with stories and ideas that are unique.
 It has been deliberate (as) we want to push boundaries; we want to push the envelope as far as content is concerned... I was always driven by content. I was not fooled by pop culture. I was not fooled by songs. I was not fooled by just beauty when I saw films. So that is something that I will reflect in my choices.
 As a producer I have always backed content which has been unique and which, you can also say, has been dark. But I don't really categorise them into anything. For me, stories are stories. They are ideas and they just have to be said in the most truthful way possible and I think that's what we've always tried to do.
 Emergence of streaming platforms has been a real boon for creative people, Anushka said.
 "Paatal Lok" is Bollywood actor's first production in the digital medium.
 As a creative individual, you understand that the process of creativity should be a free-flowing. So what the OTT platforms do is that they allow you to express yourself in a way that is true to the story that you are trying to say and you can remain true to it, she said.

With concern mounting after Manmeets suicide, they have also started counselling sessions.We have activated our zonal structures so that they start connecting with members in their geographical area and no one takes any extreme step out of anxiety, depression or stress, Behl added.Explaining how the payment structure works,IFTPC chairperson J D Majethia said there is a 60-90 day cycle for payments from advertisers to broadcasters to producers to artistes and technicians.There is a minimum gap of two-three months from when we start shooting and when our shows go on air. Plus, there is GST that producers pay in advance and shoot expenses plus monthly salaries, which makes the cost of production high when the show goes on air.The 90-day cycle is decided keeping in mind all these variables, including the fact that it takes months to sometimes break even. But not paying after 90 days is not acceptable. If there is an unforeseen circumstance, talk to your unit but dont hold on to payments, especially during these times, Majethia told PTI.Many in the small screen industry echoed him.Actor Nia Sharma, from the popular show Jamai Raja, recently took to Instagram to highlight the plight of small screen actors following Manmeets suicide.I know many of my actor friends who havent been paid since last year or more. With rents and EMIs mounting, work this year clearly being halted indefinitely, everyones losing patience somewhere.Id just like to make a humble request on behalf of my fellow actors/friends and others that their dues be paid ASAP so that were not waking up to more such suicide stories a few days or a month later, she posted.Aishwarya Sakhuja, who was seen in Saas Bina Sasural, said many stars have raised concerns about the 90-day period of payment in the industry.We have always had this 90-day period of credit, thats how the TV industry has been functioning. Savings are essential. Its important that every actor does this because its an unstable profession. We go from one project to another, Aishwarya said.According to actor Sara Khan, its extremely important for aspiring actors and even existing stars to not solely depend on their television careers and find other sources of income.Her colleague Sayantani Ghosh said these are tough times and it can be difficult to survive without work in a city like Mumbai but one must stay strong.I would urge everyone to please hang on tight, please dont not give into substance abuse or hurting yourself. Please be positive, take help from friends and family if need be, but hang in there.

 However, now the Board’s chairman has confirmed the date and time of the declaration of the result. The result will be announced by Bihar Education Minister Krishna Nandan Prasad Verma, said Kishor.

Amid growing public anger and political unease, the government said Cummings would make a statement and answer questions later Monday — a rare public foray for an unelected figure who usually exerts influence behind the scenes.
 A self-styled political disrupter who disdains the media and civil service, Cummings has been essential to Johnson’s rise to power. He was one of the architects of the successful campaign to take Britain out of the European Union, and orchestrated Brexit champion Johnson’s thumping election victory in December.
 Five months on from that triumph, Johnson’s government is facing criticism for its response to a pandemic that has hit Britain harder than any other European country. Britain’s official coronavirus death toll stands at 36,793, the second-highest confirmed total in the world after the United States.
 The coronavirus laid low a swath of senior U.K. officials, including Cummings, Health Secretary Matt Hancock and Johnson himself, who spent several days in intensive care at a London hospital in April.
 The U.K. is gradually easing its lockdown, allowing more outdoor recreation and letting some shops and businesses reopen.
 But as Johnson gathered his Cabinet on Monday to discuss plans to reopen schools and more stores starting June 1, the Cummings scandal showed no signs of dying down.

MADRID (AP) — Spanish league clubs are now allowed to train with groups of up to 14 players as the league stays on track to restart in less than three weeks.
 Only 10 players were allowed in group training last week because of confinement restrictions that are gradually being lifted across the hard-hit southern European nation where nearly 30,000 people have died with COVID-19.
 Group training sessions are part of the penultimate phase before teams can be considered ready to return to competition. Full squad sessions are expected to begin next week, depending on how the coronavirus pandemic progresses.
 “We’ve gone through some very difficult and complicated moments during this pandemic and we don’t want to jump the gun,” Spanish league president Javier Tebas said late Sunday in his weekly interview with league broadcaster Movistar.
 Players were only allowed to practice individually during the first stage of training.
 Tebas said the competition is expected to resume without fans on June 11 — a Thursday — with the Seville derby. He said the popular first-division match between rivals Sevilla and Real Betis would be a good way to mark the return to competition and “honor those who have lost their lives” during the pandemic in Spain.

LANSING, Mich. (WLNS) - An international partnership over the last 35 years makes economic sense and revitalizes communities.      The United States and Canada have invested over $22.8 billion over the last 35 years to restore Areas of Concern throughout the Great Lakes, according to a study published in the Journal of Great Lakes Research.      The study found that the money has been well-spent with investments in cleanups helping revitalize communities with over a 3 to 1 return on investment. Basically, for every $1 spent, the communities received $3 worth of benefits.      One of the authors of the study Gail Krantzberg of McMaster University says that investing in pollution prevention will avoid substantial future cleanups in the long run.      “These are unprecedented collaborations of international significance, where creative, shared responsibilities stimulate and sustain advances in the clean- up of local waterways, raise public awareness of individuals’ responsibilities, create jobs for a green future, and unite a community around a shared purpose, which makes the lakes truly great,” said Krantzberg, a professor at McMaster University who specializes in Great Lakes science, policy, and governance.      The study traced the history of the Great Lakes Remedial Action Plan program from when it started in 1985 as well as identifying what has been accomplished and learned since that time.      Remedial Action Plans being part of the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement in 1987 gave legitimacy to cleanup efforts in Areas of Concern.      Paul Sibley, president of the International Association for Great Lakes Research, said the study showed clearly how a strong foundation of federal environmental laws, combined with locally-led cleanup processes, can achieve restoration of the most polluted areas of the Great Lakes and catalyze waterfront community revitalization.      “Lessons learned from this research will be helpful to all groups working to clean up polluted waterways and revitalize communities,” Sibley said.      This includes the cleanup efforts at 43 Areas of Concern which focused networks of community members on plans that took 10 to 15 years to create.

mbonisi you are deluded into thinking that every shona was complicit in gukurahundi. just like hitler stoods for all germans ? faulty logic if you ask me and steeped in tribal bigotry too..stereotypes are the lazy man's easy way out because he does not have the stomach for truth. you want to believe the lie about all shonas conveniently so you can hate on them. i know ndebele boys who have married shona gals. did they also betray you ? now you have a whole coterie of haters such as mthwakazi with their separatist fantasies. on what are they predicated ? kingdom ? which one ? the one Lobengula had before Rhodes took over ? That historical fact lapsed didn't it ? So if we have to set boundaries now what premise do we use ? the colonial Ndebele era or the rozvi or munhumutapa empire of which most of present day matebeleland was a part of as guruuswa before 'you' came ? do you see your slippery slope ? actually that time is still fresh in the psyche of many shonas , so don't start on that one- eye for an eye. you cry too loudly. the error was made by the ndebele leadership in 1980 who could not stomach the electoral result and perhaps being nostalgic about kingdom and so called mthwakazi which led them to insurrection. what is government to do when you have a rebellion ? now of course those that in the name of law and order went overboard and slaughtered innocents must stand trial in my opinion. but don't let your anger cloud your vision of this country.shonas have their grievances too. but its pointless to belabour that. there wer a lot of cattle and women who were looted by ndebele marauders from mashonaland. when are the reparations for that ? don't even start on that because there are records for the robberies. so any ndebele woman who marries a shona is simply being repatriated if want to be vulgar bro.
