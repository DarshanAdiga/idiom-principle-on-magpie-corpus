I do not know if the United States can summon the sense of common purpose and shared identity required to secure a safe and prosperous future for Americans. The divisions between Americans may be too deep, and their current crop of politicians (or their financial backers) may be too selfish and unprincipled to rise above party and personal ambition and recommit themselves to the greater good. As I said 14 years ago: “Although geography, history, and good fortune have combined to give the United States a remarkable array of advantages, it would still be possible to squander them.” And if it does, I warned, “we will have only ourselves to blame.”

Some of the references may go over your head. Poe tries different methods of cooking the "tip-yip," an Endorian chicken that attendees of Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge will recognize as one of the foods served in the park. But the whole thing moves so fast -- with the speed and energy of kids at play who don't give a hoot that the stories they're telling aren't canon -- that if one joke flies past the next one will probably land. And yet a lot of the low- hanging fruit mercifully goes uncollected. It's for the best that Gungan jokes aren't here or an over-reliance on Hoth for a "holiday" setting (the icebound planet only shows up briefly).

In a September 2019 interview, Deakins urged The Criterion Collection to jump on board and release the extended "Jesse James" cut. The cinematographer added, "I would really like to see the long version, the first cut that I saw, released on Criterion. That’s what I’d hope for. It was over three hours. I don’t think it ever will, because last time I talked to Andrew about it he was quite happy with the version that got released. But I still remember that first early cut that I saw and it was pretty stunning."

“We leave that up to them; it’s something we can’t control and we go into this game positive.”
 The Nations League, introduced in 2018, has never been Northern Ireland’s friend. They have drawn one and lost eight of their nine games to date – only avoiding the drop last time around thanks to a change in format – but relegation under these circumstances would represent a new low.
 Northern Ireland v Slovakia – UEFA Euro 2020 – Play-offs – Final – Windsor Park (PA Wire)
 They will go into the game short on numbers, with Baraclough’s squad reduced to 20 by the withdrawals of Steven Davis, Kyle Lafferty and Jordan Thompson on Tuesday, adding to the earlier exits of Niall McGinn and George Saville.
 Davis has withdrawn for personal reasons.
 The Rangers midfielder, one cap shy of Peter Shilton’s UK record of 125, will be 36 when the squad next meets up in March for the start of World Cup qualifying, but Baraclough said there was no reason to believe fans had seen the last of him in a Northern Ireland shirt.
 “The only people that have mentioned stuff like that have been the media,” he said. “The conversations I’ve had with everyone in the group have been very positive.
 “The lads showed character in abundance in the Austria game and the senior lads are at the front, driving it on. I don’t see anything that tells me that Steven Davis is not ready to play anymore.”
 Davis’ absence could give an opportunity to the likes of Ali McCann, who made his debut on Sunday, or Manchester United’s uncapped Ethan Galbraith.
 “He may well (play),” Baraclough said of Galbraith. “He’s gaining massive experience of being around these lads, training day in, day out, being part of the group. The last six months have told me that he’s grown up as an individual, grown as a player.
 “Man United are really happy with his development, he’s signed a new deal. I think it’s my job to bring young players through, give them an opportunity, and see how they get on.
 “Ethan is one of those, along with Ali McCann, Dan Ballard – we’ve seen that, given the chance, they are capable, but they have to go and step up.
 “Hopefully one or two of them might come on in the next two or three years. There has to be that transition throughout and that is constantly happening.”

The material initially was sought in the summer of 2019 as part of the committee's investigation of possible misconduct by Trump, including whether he obstructed Mueller's investigation. Mueller's 448-page report, issued in April 2019, "stopped short" of reaching conclusions about Trump's conduct to avoid stepping on the House's impeachment power, the federal appeals court in Washington said in March when it ruled that the materials should be turned over.

But it is the actions that companies have taken around the election that are likely to be a dominant focus at Tuesday’s hearing.
 The Republican majority on the judiciary panel threatened Mr Zuckerberg and Mr Dorsey with subpoenas last month if they did not agree to voluntarily give evidence for the hearing.
 Republicans on the Senate Commerce Committee lambasted the two chief executives and Sundar Pichai, Google’s chief executive, at a hearing last month for what they said was a pattern of silencing conservative viewpoints while giving free rein to political actors from countries such as China and Iran.
 Despite fears over security in the run-up to November 3 and social media companies bracing for the worst, the election turned out to be the most secure in US history, federal and state officials from both parties say – repudiating Mr Trump’s unsubstantiated claims of fraud.
 Facebook insists it has learned its lesson from the 2016 election and is no longer a conduit for misinformation, voter suppression and election disruption.
 This autumn, Facebook said it removed a small network of accounts and pages linked to Russia’s Internet Research Agency, the “troll factory” that has used social media accounts to sow political discord in the US since the 2016 election.
 Twitter suspended five related accounts.

Una lista curada por The Associated Press de lo que está llegando esta semana a la TV, los servicios de streaming y las plataformas musicales. CINE — El nuevo proyecto del realizador de “12 Years a Slave” (“12 años esclavo”) y “Widows” (“Viudas”) Steve McQueen, “Small Axe”, se estrena en Amazon Prime Video esta semana en Estados Unidos. Con cinco historias únicas, la serie antológica sobre la comunidad caribeña de Londres en las décadas de 1960, 70 y 80 comienza el viernes con “Mangrove”, sobre un grupo de activistas negros que fueron arrestados y enjuiciados por tratar de incitar disturbios. Los detenidos, conocidos como los “Mangrove Nine”, protestaban contra la discriminación policiaca en un restaurante caribeño en la zona de Notting Hill que servía como punto de reunión para activistas e intelectuales del movimiento por los derechos civiles de Gran Bretaña y solía ser objeto de redadas de la policía. Letitia Wright, conocida por su papel de la hermana menor de Black Panther, Shuri, actúa en la serie. — Una vez que termines de ver “Mangrove”, quizás quieras darte el gusto de ver una fantasía navideña como “Dolly Parton’s Christmas on the Square”, un musical brillante que llega a Netflix el domingo. Christine Baranski interpreta a una Scrooge en tacones que trata de desahuciar a todo un pueblo en Nochebuena. Dolly, naturalmente, interpreta a un ángel que la visita para convencerla de lo contrario. Por si no fuera suficiente, el especial es dirigido y coreografiado por Debbie Allen. — O quizá estás buscando algo de escapismo del tipo de ciencia ficción y terror absurdo. Si este es el caso, “Underwater”, protagonizada por Kristen Stewart como una ingeniera mecánica en las profundidades del mar, debuta el sábado en HBO. La película, que recuerda...

My family and I came here nine years ago as strangers to this city. Over time — thanks to the support and warmth from you, the Ricketts and our fans — Chicago has become our beloved home, the Cubs a second family, and our fans like an extended network of friends. Our boys have grown up watching games at Wrigley, loving the team, and running around the outfield on off days, trying to lose as many balls as possible into the ivy; selfishly, nothing can match the feeling of having them smile and rush into my arms to sing and watch the crowd during every seventh-inning stretch, no matter how old they are getting. The front office and team have enjoyed countless champagne celebrations together and even commiserated a few tough games with fans at Murphy’s under the L flag. The constant banter, laughs and friendships formed in the office, up in the box, and in the clubhouse will last a lifetime. (Unfortunately, so will the hamstring tears from our spring training soccer scrimmages and postseason basketball marathons.) We’ll cherish the pre-game chats with Billy Williams about Cubs history and all the great teams that came up just short, and then the privilege of getting to see the joy on his face as he slipped on his World Series ring for the first time. I keep remembering that feeling from the carefree and expectant days just as we started to turn the corner on the rebuild, walking home after games inconspicuously amongst the fans — all in the jerseys of their new favorite players — hearing them talk excitedly about the upstart young team, feeling their confidence surging. And we’ll never forget the generations of families celebrating together at the parade, nor the images of Cubs pennants and hats draped on gravestones for family members who did not quite live to see the day.

While this shift became more prominent after the MVA government came to power, it has been in the works for a long time. In 2003, Uddhav launched a campaign called Mee Mumbaikar, aimed at including people of all religions and regions in the development of the city, as noted by India Today. This marked a huge shift from the ideology espoused by Bal Thackeray, who was indicted by the Srikrishna Commission for his role in inciting the 1992-1993 riots. The Shiv Sena founder had also famously said that he was proud of the party workers who took part in demolishing the Babri Masjid in Ayodhya.

Despite the health benefits provided by organic coffee, high cost is considered to be a prominent reason for its differential demand in emerging countries as compared to developed economies. However, regulatory agencies across the boards are taking necessary steps to democratize organic coffee. Regulatory bodies are emphasizing on fair trade coffee pricing, which would not only reduce counterfeit coffee products sales, but also aids in lowering the prices. As a result of this, the organic coffee is being accessible to the larger consumer base, thus augmenting the growth of organic coffee market.

"The Bachelor" franchise is no stranger to wild love stories, sparking successful marriages -- and some scandalous last-minute switcheroos -- over the span of its 40 seasons.
 But even many of the series' biggest fans were shocked when "Bachelorette" star Clare Crawley ended her season after just two weeks to get engaged to Dale Moss.
 Many still believe that the couple's story was too good to be true -- that it was indeed love at first sight and that they must have communicated before filming began. But Catherine Lowe has Crawley's back.
 "Clare knows what she wants, she's not trying to waste no time," Lowe told Insider while promoting Ivory's Acts of Gentle Kindness Initiative. "She's not trying to play games. Clare did what she wanted and more power to her."

Mayor Pro Tem Amy Shamroe asked if Monday’s move wasn’t in response to the court order.
 City Attorney Lauren Trible Laucht said that order affected recreational marijuana retail rules, not medical, as Monday’s action did.
 “However, they are interrelated, because we don’t know for sure at this time whether all medical facilities will be allowed to operate automatically as recreational,” she said.
 The question factors heavily into Leoni Wellness LLC’s challenge and that of SecureCann Inc, both of which made similar arguments that the city capping recreational retail at four licenses versus 13 for medical is a de-facto ban on allowing the two types of retailers to share space — state law prohibits such bans.
 Both cases are proceeding in 13th Circuit Court, records show, and another is in the works.

Lynn Sandlin, business intelligence manager with Syngenta, says the agriculture industry has shown it is resilient under any circumstances.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    “One of the things we’ve been very impressed with this year has been, in light of COVID and the pandemic, looking at the strength of the resiliency of the American farmer,” Sandlin said. “And the total export logistics system of being able to move commodities – in this case corn and soybeans – out of the US and into the marketplace in a very admirable fashion to where really it’s helping see some strengthening in the overall commodity prices.”

Whenever the fruit comes off from the trees, they are ready to eat.
 On Nov. 5, volunteers from Emporia State, Emporia High, the church and surrounding area came to help plant the trees. However, five of the plant trees were damaged.
 “They did plant five trees [on Nov. 5] and then we are going to plant the other five … [on Nov. 12],” Parks said.
 On the training webinar, Parks learned a lot about the fruit trees and how to take care of them. Giving Grove provided them with the trees, fertilizer, tools, mulch and branch spreaders. The webinar informed them that the trees will start to bear fruit in three years. Alderman added that the community will be notified and they can come over when the pears are ready.
 “They will probably have several weeks to pick these pears, store them and eat them as needed,” he said. “Another thing about pears is they will store for a significant amount of time compared to other fruits.”
 Parks and Alderman both said that Big Gardens will come to check on the orchard frequently and provide ongoing webinars to take care of the trees.
 “Hopefully we will have an abundance of fruit for our community,” Parks said. “I think it is just a way of reaching out to the people that need help as this pandemic has made a bad year for us.”
 She is excited for the future when the trees start to bear the fruit.
 GUMC and Abundant Harvest are both willing to plant more groves for the community with Big Gardens. Parks said that they will try to plant some fruit trees at the church’s community garden, located at . On Nov. 9, Alderman told Big Gardens that if they wanted to plant more trees, Abundant Harvest would gladly plant 10 more.
 “I still have some extra property,” he said. “May as well put it to good use.”

Emma Lavelle accepts Paisely Park may need to progress again if he is to regain his Stayers’ Hurdle crown at the Cheltenham Festival.

Some of the references may go over your head. Poe tries different methods of cooking the "tip-yip," an Endorian chicken that attendees of Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge will recognize as one of the foods served in the park. But the whole thing moves so fast — with the speed and energy of kids at play who don't give a hoot that the stories they're telling aren't canon — that if one joke flies past the next one will probably land. And yet a lot of the low- hanging fruit mercifully goes uncollected. It's for the best that Gungan jokes aren't here or an over-reliance on Hoth for a "holiday" setting (the icebound planet only shows up briefly).

Martin Scorsese executive-produces this gritty and hard-edged examination of loss centered on Martha (Kirby) and Sean (LaBeouf), a Boston couple reeling after a home birth ends in tragedy. Martha spirals into a messy, yearlong odyssey of grief, often pained discovery while also haunted by memories of what went wrong with the now publicly vilified midwife (Molly Parker), who she must face in court. Martha also has to answer to her domineering mother, played enormously by Burstyn in another career-topping turn of many. Sean, meanwhile, goes on his own journey inward and out of control as the pair try to pick up the pieces, even as they are rarely moving in the same direction.

He was the son of Robert E. and Evelyn (Banning) Bamberg. Bob was born in New Haven, CT. His family moved from Woodbridge to Hamden as he attended Hamden Hall Country Day School, from which he graduated in 1948. He attended Georgia Institute of Technology. Drafted, he was stationed in Iceland during the Korean War, coming home to join his father in business. Bob succeeded his father as President of Chas. S. Leete Co., Inc of West Haven, a pharmaceutical distribution company. He was well-known for providing superlative service to "his" pharmacies and the people they served. He served on the Board of Hopmeadow Place Condominium Association in Simsbury for thirteen years, in charge of physical maintenance of the building. He also was the man to call when any resident had a need. He was President of the Board when he died.   He was a member of the New Haven Rotary Club. He was a 32nd degree Mason, a charter member of the Orange Masonic Lodge, now the Ansantawae Lodge #89 (Milford). His family lovingly referred to him as the Energizer Bunny, both for his constant motion and for his longevity. To the end, no loved one was so old that he did not demand of them, "when was the last time you checked the oil in that "thing'" (their car)", what the weather was like where they lived, and if there was anything they needed.   There seemed nothing he could not repair, extending the lifespan of things mechanical well beyond reasonable expectations. He was a sure and steady presence in the lives of those who were lucky enough to call him husband, brother, dad, uncle, grandfather, great-grandfather, neighbor and/or friend. He was always there for his family in whatever way he could be. His impact was wide and deep, as was his love.   Bob was predeceased by a sister, Arlene Bamberg Arnold, and two sons, Paul and John. He leaves his loving wife, Peg, two children Claire W. Bamberg of Randolph Center, VT and her wife, Lynda B. Howells, and a son Robert O. Bamberg of N Muskegon, MI, six grandchildren, two step-grandchildren, eight great-grandchildren and three step great-grandchildren.   Arrangements are being made through Vincent Funeral Homes in Simsbury, CT. Services will be online at a time to be arranged, and donations may be made to: New Jersey Institute of Technology, in memory of Paul Bamberg, and/or the Palliative Care Unit of Hartford Hospital in memory of John Bamberg.

The promise of antigen tests emerged like a miracle this summer. With repeated use, the theory went, these rapid and cheap coronavirus tests would identify highly infectious people while giving healthy Americans a green light to return to offices, schools and restaurants. The idea of on-the-spot tests with near-instant results was an appealing alternative to the slow, lab-based testing that couldn't meet public demand.

Girl hasn't been back to her hometown -- a seedy Pacific Northwest hamlet named Golden, where the shine appears to have worn off quite some time ago -- since she was six years old, when her dirtbag father (John Clifford Talbot) kicked her and Mama out, adding a grievous injury to Mama's back for good measure. The family has been fractured ever since, but a recent missive from "Daddy" in which he makes plain both his refusal to pay child support _and_ his desire to kill Mama for even asking for it has pushed Girl to the brink. Patricide is a tough enough ask as is, but one thrown into further turmoil with the reveal that someone has beaten Girl to the punch.

If Trump is able to push even further and end all US military operations in Afghanistan, that would itself be a milestone moment, especially for a lame duck president obsessed with shoring up his own legacy. To accomplish the plan, he would need to overlook enormous logistical concerns, as well as the presence of a weak Afghan government that has struggled to assert control at a time when Taliban attacks on that country's security forces are rising. His party, which has generally been loyal to a fault, is also not clamoring to support this particular effort. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), one of many hawkish Republicans to sound off about the plan to _Politico_, said it would "would hurt our allies and delight the people who wish us harm."

"As the election approached and the polls pointed to a Trump defeat, there was a growing sense that his moment of reckoning was coming. He was, after all, already the subject of a criminal investigation by the district attorney of Manhattan as well as a civil investigation by the attorney general of New York State," he wrote. "Both of those inquiries concern his conduct as a private businessman. The bigger and infinitely more fraught question is how to address Trump’s potentially criminal acts as a political candidate and president. Those would most likely be federal crimes that could only be prosecuted by the federal government."

 “My car was packed before the ceremony,” she recalled, laughing. “I drove straight through the night. I’d never been to New York before. I had no idea there were mountains here.

In the case of a two-dose vaccine that may arrive in large batches and have to be kept at extremely low temperatures, meeting prioritization goals is harder still. If a person receives one dose and then fails to show up for a second shot, they will have wasted a dose that could have been used for another recipient. And with numerous vaccines under development, some people in targeted groups may decide to wait in the hope there's a better option in the pipeline.

It’s also super-hydrophobic causing water to bead and run off. In fact, it leaves such a smooth surface that weed and barnacles will struggle to get a grip on it, leading to claims that it can be used as a form of antifouling on bare gelcoat and may even reduce fuel consumption in the process.

"We really do need to see the data, the full data set," he said. "That data set needs to be made available to the FDA and to other scientists. President- elect Biden has said all along he's going to let science lead the way, and so it's critical that we are able to see that in a transparent way and the best recommendations from those scientists are made for the FDA, and then that information is carried forward to the American public."

Given my lackadaisical approach to cleaning I opted for the former but even with this marginally less perfect finish, it left my boat looking like a different beast. It really could have been a brand new boat. They also coated my cockpit seat cushions with Ceramic Pro Care + fabric treatment and demonstrated its effectiveness by pouring a bottle of Coke over it!

In Mexico, the pandemic has also had disproportionate effects in low-income communities and taken an economic toll. More than 40 percent of Mexico’s population lives below the poverty line and 7 percent live in extreme poverty. The pandemic, which threatens to increase global extreme poverty by 2021, further narrows people’s options. Between the increasing challenges of migration to the United States and the dwindling opportunities in Mexico, families like Ortega’s find themselves between a rock and a hard place.

Girl hasn't been back to her hometown — a seedy Pacific Northwest hamlet named Golden, where the shine appears to have worn off quite some time ago — since she was six years old, when her dirtbag father (John Clifford Talbot) kicked her and Mama out, adding a grievous injury to Mama's back for good measure. The family has been fractured ever since, but a recent missive from "Daddy" in which he makes plain both his refusal to pay child support and his desire to kill Mama for even asking for it has pushed Girl to the brink. Patricide is a tough enough ask as is, but one thrown into further turmoil with the reveal that someone has beaten Girl to the punch.

"The stakes of prosecuting Donald Trump may be high; but so are the costs of not prosecuting him, which would send a dangerous message, one that transcends even the presidency, about the country’s commitment to the rule of law. Trump has presented Biden — and America, really — with a very difficult dilemma," he wrote before adding that financial crimes not already being looked into by the state of New York would be fair game as well as election improprieties, public corruption and obstruction of justice.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Democratic-controlled House of Representatives is asking the Supreme Court to put off upcoming arguments about whether Congress should have access to secret grand jury testimony from special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation.The House Judiciary Committee that takes office in January “will have to determine whether it wishes to continue pursuing the application for the grand-jury materials that gave rise to this case,” Douglas Letter, the top lawyer for the House said in a written filing Tuesday. Letter noted that President Donald Trump’s defeat in his bid for reelection could affect the committee’s decision.The case is scheduled to be argued on Dec. 2.The material initially was sought in the summer of 2019 as part of the committee’s investigation of possible misconduct by Trump, including whether he obstructed Mueller’s investigation. Mueller’s 448-page report, issued in April 2019, “stopped short” of reaching conclusions about Trump’s conduct to avoid stepping on the House’s impeachment power, the federal appeals court in Washington said in March when it ruled that the materials should be turned over.By the time of the appellate ruling, Trump had been impeached by the House for his efforts to get Ukraine to announce an investigation of Democrat Joe Biden, and acquitted by the Senate.The Supreme Court effectively kept the grand jury documents secret through the election in a series of orders in the spring and early summer.Now it’s possible the justices might never have to reach a definitive ruling in a sensitive dispute between the executive and legislative branches of government. Democrats had suggested that previously undisclosed details from the investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election could reveal new misconduct that could have potentially formed the basis of new articles of impeachment.But it’s unclear how many new, or incendiary, revelations might be contained in the grand jury transcripts. Mueller’s report, though redacted in parts, revealed significant information about the president’s efforts to choke off the investigation and raised substantial questions about whether he had committed obstruction of justice.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.

I'm a licensed acupuncturist/massage therapist with over 15 years experience in helping clients reduce pain, tension and stress through bodywork, acupuncture and nutritional consults. By gathering feedback from thousands of clients over the years, I realized that there was a common pattern of client frustrations in the massage market, due to inconsistent pressure and inconsistent results when frequenting mainstream massage facilities. Being an insider with experience working in quite a few of these facilities, I understood the root of these issues. So here’s how it looks: you usually have an undereducated client who doesn’t necessarily know what they need, but they knows they need some relief and assume they are seeking help from 'experts' in the field. Clients are often too shy to give direction to therapist when pressure is not to their liking. Then therapists potentially fall short because they have only been taught basic massage school curriculum, which may fall short in teaching them effective communication between therapist and client and teaching advanced therapeutic techniques. Massage Establishments tend to offer little to no in-house training or guidelines to therapists to achieve consistent high quality results, and they under-pay therapists. This forces therapists to need to work extended hours which means they likely won’t be able to put in as much effort as needed to give a high quality Deep Tissue massage.

 Malawi denied that the Bushiris were on the president’s plane and complained that Mr Chakwera’s departure on Friday from a military airbase near Pretoria was delayed for seven hours by South Africa for “unspecified security reasons”.
 They added that South African security personnel searched Mr Chakwera’s plane and the entire delegation’s luggage. It is unknown why.
 Aaron Motsoaledi, South Africa’s home affairs minister, raised the possibility that the Bushiris left through a land border into northern neighbour Zimbabwe and then onto Malawi.
 I am also rich. In fact, I know what I'm doing
 Bushiri, 37, who is a pastor and businessman, came to prominence after founding the Enlightened Christian Gathering Church. It claims hundreds of thousands of followers in South Africa and has branched out to other African countries.
 His end-of-year sermons at football stadiums often attract between 90,000 and 100,000 people.
 Bushiri’s full church title is General Overseer Prophet Shepherd Bushiri, while he also sometimes calls himself “Major 1″. Keen on wearing slick suits, Bushiri makes no secret of his focus on wealth alongside God. According to the church, his “investment company” has interests in mining, real estate and the airline business. It is highlighted by the church as much as his preaching.

Devolution in Wales has been able to “thrive” under a Welsh Labour government, First Minister Mark Drakeford has said.
 His claim followed comments made by Boris Johnson after he told Conservative MPs that devolution had been “Tony Blair’s biggest mistake”.
 At Tuesday’s Questions to the First Minister session at the Senedd, Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price told Mr Drakeford that “to reverse the Prime Minister’s logic, it is because Westminster has proven so disastrous to Wales that this Senedd exists”.
 Mr Drakeford replied: “The Senedd exists not because of the failure of the Boris Johnson government, but because of the success of a Labour government in making devolution happen in the first place.
 “Devolution thrives when there is a Labour government to support it, and devolution comes under the sorts of pressures that it is now under when we have a Conservative government, and where you scratch the surface of the Conservative Party and all its old hostility to devolution rises back to the surface.
 “That’s what happened yesterday, when the Prime Minister thought that he could show off in front of a few Conservative MPs from the north of England.”

The 25-year-old is doing his bit for Movember with some impressive bristles on his upper-lip but it was only a month ago that he and his Chiefs colleagues Stuart Hogg, Jonny Gray and Sam Hidalgo-Clyne survived a close shave with Racing 92.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The Premiership champions had just enough to see off Finn Russell’s swashbuckling Parisians to claim their first-ever Heineken Champions Cup.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    It was a breakthrough result which has firmly established Rob Baxter’s Sandy Park outfit amongst the European elite and Skinner is still basking in the glory of his accomplishments at club level.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    But the 6ft 5ins forward believes he is not the only member of Gregor Townsend’s squad who has grown with confidence in recent months, with the Dark Blues hoping to make it six wins in a row for the first time since 1990 when they face France at Murrayfield on Sunday in their second Autumn Nations Cup clash.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    “I definitely don’t have a swagger, especially with this hangman moustache which I’m wearing on my face at the minute,” laughed Skinner.

Of course, every parent will have moments when their parenting is less than ideal -- but that's ok.
 "Sometimes they may still say, 'because I'm the parent,' but their child learns that when they said that it is because it's true, not just because they feel the need to be the boss," Glicksman said.
 In the long run, authoritative parenting can help children meet other social expectations both in childhood and adulthood.
 "We live in a world where authority is a part of everything we do, and your first sense of what authority is comes from your parents, so you have to help children learn boundaries and structure but in a positive, healthy way," Mion- Araoz said.

"I grappled with such matters in my book, 'When God Doesn’t Make Sense.' I wrote one morning after pacing back and forth in my study, 'We must never forget that He is God. He is majestic and holy and sovereign. He is accountable to no one. He is not an errand boy who chases the assignments we dole out. He is not a genie who pops out of the bottle to satisfy our whims. He is not our servant—we are His. And our reason for existence is to glorify and honor Him . . . even when nothing makes sense. I then heard Him say, 'Trust Me.""

The couple have until Thursday to hand themselves in at a courthouse in the capital Pretoria.
 Failing that, authorities will start confiscating the Bushiris’ properties, which include a £264,000 house in an exclusive estate on the outskirts of the city.
 If the Bushiris don’t return, police will go to the Malawian government to “enforce the arrest warrant”, warned Katlego Mogale, spokeswoman for the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation, a police unit that investigates high-profile crimes.
 South African authorities still do not know how the Bushiris slipped out of the country after police said they took away their passports when they were released on bail.

The former Rams DE signed with the Falcons as a free agent during the offseason to a three-year, $48 million deal.

There's no precedent for the government to bet this much on a product before it's been thoroughly vetted, said Matthew Pettengill, scientific director of clinical microbiology at Thomas Jefferson University. "They put the cart before the horse, and we still can't see the horse."

The announcement comes less than a day after Washington reversed course on allowing fans at home games. On Monday, WFT said it will not let fans into FedEx Field for its upcoming game against the Cincinnati Bengals due to the continued impacts of COVID-19, according to the team in a statement. The team had only just decided to allow fans back, and played one game on Nov. 8 against the Giants in front of approximately 3,000 fans.

On the one hand, you have David E. Kelley: a prolific television writer and producer with critically-acclaimed work dating back to the eighties. Chief among his accomplishments was the creation of _Ally McBeal_ —a legal comedy/drama about the romantic and social lives of a firm of lawyers, in particular the title character ( _played by Calista Flockhart_ ). The show was a HUGE critical and commercial success, netting an enormous audience of 18-34-year-old women who found the heroine relatable and endearing, but also capable and even _aspirational_ ; for better or worse, _Ally McBeal_ would become one of the biggest pop-feminist icons of the late 20th/early 21st centuries1This status cut both ways, of course; critics complained that the character’s flightiness, unprofessionalism, and frequently tumultuous emotional state made her a demeaning caricature of women in the workplace. Time magazine would even release an issue with McBeal on the cover—next to pictures of Susan B. Anthony, Betty Friedan, and Gloria Steinem—with the banner headline “ _Is Feminism Dead?_ ”.

This is the smartest virus there ever was. It knows it can get you going in and out of restaurants, but it will stand down while you eat. It knows not to bother you if you are protesting for some causes but other causes are fair game. It knows it cannot go into some businesses, such as grocery stores and liquor stores, but churches and sport facilities are fair game. Smartest virus ever!!!

Some people actively enjoy polishing their boat day in, day out. I’m not one of them. Life is too short and I’d rather spend the time using my boat rather than cleaning it. The fact that it sits on a swing mooring all summer without access to a fresh water hose doesn’t help either, so other than a quick slosh down with a bucket of seawater at both ends of the day, that’s as good as it gets.
