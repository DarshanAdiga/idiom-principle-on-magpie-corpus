"Questo e il momento di trovare l'unita per salvare vite umane e sconfiggere il nuovo coronavirus", ha detto monsignor Sabastian Shaw, arcivescovo di Lahore, rivolgendosi ai pakistani, durante la conferenza stampa della campagna della Chiesa "Fai maschere e salva vite”, a Lahore. Finora l'arcidiocesi e riuscita a consegnare 15 mila maschere e disinfettante per le mani alle parrocchie di otto distretti del Punjab. E monsignor Shaw ha tenuto a sottolineare come la Chiesa abbia “consigliato a tutte le parrocchie di distribuire le maschere senza alcuna discriminazione religiosa, razziale o settaria”, gratuitamente, mostrando, anzi, “compassione verso i nostri nemici e dando le maschere a coloro con cui non amiamo parlare".

Kodaline are making serious strides in 2020, as they prepare to release their eagerly anticipated fourth album later this year! Last week I caught up with Kodaline’s front man Steve Garrigan, who was self-isolating in his Dublin home. Steve joined me on Instagram live.   He has been apart from his Kodaline mates for the last number of weeks with the bands guitarist Mike Prendergast testing positive for Covid-19.   Steve told us that Mike was “doing good, taking care of himself while isolating and on the road to a full recovery’. The star also urged us all to take this very seriously ‘be safe and follow guidelines put in place by the government and the HSE’   Aside from the “C’ word I was happy to chat all things new music, life and Limerick!   ‘Wherever You Are’, was the first single to drop from their upcoming album, it quickly exceeded 10 million streams, while the emotional accompanying video added another 3.3 million views in January alone. Last summer the band played to a crowd of 60,000 at Electric Picnic. The festival performance reached an emotional crescendo when Cranberries' guitarist Noel Hogan joined Kodaline on stage for ‘Zombie’, a whole-hearted tribute to the late Dolores O ‘Riordan.   It also represented Kodaline going back to the beginning. Steve spoke to me about their first arena show, which came when the Cranberries invited them to open a gig in Paris back in 2012.   “The Cranberries gave us our first break. They invited us on tour with them. I’ll never forget it, we were rehearsing in Swords in this little prefab when we got a call saying that The Cranberries wanted to take us on tour around France in arenas and honestly we were so nervous, it was a sink or swim moment for us.”   “It really helped us get tight as a band It was our first real experience on tour – it really made us hungry for more’   Having the opportunity to repay the favour and invite Noel on stage at EP was a very special moment for us!”   The band’s latest single is called ‘Sometimes’. Steve penned the song while on tour in Asia last year, speaking to us about it he said, “I had a really bad day dealing with my own anxiety issues and I let it get the better of me. I started writing the song in my hotel room to help me calm down; music has always helped me in that way. For me, it’s a song about accepting the bad days and trying to stay positive.”   Check out my full chat with Steve and listen to an exclusive performance on Spin’s IGTV. @spinsouthwest

Emily Fox, still a college star for North Carolina, has earned three senior caps already and competed for a World Cup roster spot. Meanwhile, last year the USWNT held a training camp with a number of top stars of the college game. That was further evidence that the connection is still there and that figuring out how to guide players from school to the professional game is still a focus.
 To overcome the flaws of the college system and a pay-to-play model that limits participation at the lower levels, Markgraf and U.S. Soccer have placed an increased focus on their youth teams. The big move so far was the hiring of U-20 boss Laura Harvey, who has managed Arsenal, the then-named Seattle Reign FC and Utah Royals FC. The aim? To bring more professionalism to the youth levels and mold a promising group of young stars.
 That team currently features a number of future USWNT stars. Smith has the second-most U-20 goals in program history, behind longtime USWNT regular Sydney Leroux, while Brianna Pinto has already joined a USWNT camp despite being just 19. The group went on to breeze through Concacaf's U-20 Championships in February and March, scoring 40 goals, while conceding just one. Pinto scored nine of those goals while 18-year-old UCLA star Mia Fishel fired 13 to win the tournament's Golden Ball. A total of 11 players scored at least one goal while 13 provided an assist.
 “I just really liked [Laura Harvey’s] approach,” Pinto told _TopDrawerSoccer._ “She took a humble perspective where she introduced herself as the new person in our room. Some of us have been playing together on and off for the last year or so - with camps with Mark (Carr) in the past. She used the first couple of days of our January camp to see how our youth (national team) system works, to see how we interact with the support staff. Once she got comfortable and had a chance to speak with the assistant coaches, they made their plan really detailed because they wanted everyone on the same page.”
 Added Markgraf in January: "That level of tactical sophistication is something that, for these players coming from college, it is going to ramp them up. I look at that as the perfect bridge into our 23s, and then to our senior team and the pro league, so that these 20s can go and actually get a spot on a NWSL team, hopefully. So, to me, it’s an acceleration of their development in a different capacity, because they’re going to be exposed. It is a balance, it’s a balance in the cycle."
 The U-23s, meanwhile, show that there is an ongoing shift in what happens after the college level. Every single member of the 2019 USWNT World Cup squad plied their trade in the NWSL. September's U.S. U-23 squad, meanwhile, had nine of its 23 players playing abroad. Among those players were several pegged as future stars, including Hailie Mace and Alana Cook. They aren't the first Americans to go abroad, as many familiar faces and USWNT regulars have played overseas at one point or another, but it does show that the NWSL isn't the logical next step for each and every player.
 You can rely on those familiar faces for a while, and you can count on the USWNT's biggest stars longer than most, but, at some point, you need to develop that next generation. It can't be all at once, as you risk alienating legends and rushing youngsters into situations they aren't ready for. It also can't be too gradual, as the penalty of holding on too long is failure that could last a generation. It's a fine line, one that, at least to date, this program has toed better than most.

With ex-Manchester City goalkeeper Hart - then just 22 years old - and former Liverpool player James in reserve, Capello left it up to the players to decide who would start the next games, and it was the man with the unfortunate nickname who got the nod.
 "You can’t say anything. Everyone makes mistakes. He made one, so I changed. I put in Calamity James," Capello told _The Guardian_ .
 "I had Green and I had Hart, just a kid. I asked the players. Hart or Calamity? ‘Calamity.’ I put Calamity in because of the players’ trust. John Terry and the defenders had more faith in James. Hart had played only once."
 England were knocked out of the competition when they lost to Germany in the second round.
 Capello's team felt hard done by as a Frank Lampard shot struck the bar and bounced behind the line, but was not given and Germany went on to extend their lead to 4-1.
 And Capello says he knew such an incident would happen and pointed the issue out months prior.
 “Everyone saw it. Besides, because of the effect on the ball, when it hits the bar, the floor – the pitch was dry – and goes up like that, it can only have gone in: it’s physics," Capello said of Lampard's effort.

Now there are calls for a national general strike in light of the coronavirus pandemic. Nearly 10 million Americans applied for unemployment benefits within the last two weeks, the largest number ever to do so within such a short period. Yet many Americans are publicly furious over the political priorities of the $2 trillion coronavirus stimulus package, which includes $500 billion exclusively to bail out large corporations. With inadequate relief coming even as millions of additional Americans face job insecurity, pay cuts and threats to their health as a result of the novel coronavirus, a number of Americans have called for a general strike as outrage piles upon outrage: President Donald Trump trying to rush through reviving the economy even though that puts workers at risk, corporations refusing to expand hazard pay and paid sick leave, workers from essential fields being forced to perform their duties without necessary safety precautions and a general sense that the powers that be are indifferent to those whose financial security has been upended by the pandemic.

"2020 will be a success for me if I help build — collectively with the group of coaches — an infrastructure that can help enhance player development, identification and scouting mechanisms," Markgraf told _The Athletic_ in January. "That’s really it: can I do those three? And at every level of the pyramid? Whether it’s pro, whether it’s national teams, whether it’s having the discussions at the youth levels.
 "How do we figure this (youth) piece out? It’s more fractured, and it’s always going to be fractured, to be honest, with the pay-to-play model, but how do we make it where it’s not as fractured? How do we mitigate it as much as possible, where we can get better player development? So. That’s my goal. A chance to build an aligned infrastructure. Not that it wasn’t before, but a lot of it left when everyone left, so how can we do it so it’s not person dependent? So if, for example, a coach leaves, we’re not starting from scratch with all of that intellectual property, all of the information is up on one spot."
 As Markgraf alluded to, the American youth soccer system is unlike any in the world. It's an issue that has hindered progress of the U.S. men's national team for many years, with pay-to-play clubs and academies building towards the college game and, eventually, the draft or a homegrown deal.
 By and large, that is still the path for those in the USWNT youth system. Of the 20 players on the most recent U-20 roster, only two, Portland Thorns star Sophia Smith and Koln midfielder Talia DellaPeruta, were professionals. The college game, for better or worse, is still a vital part of talent development in this country.
 The good news is that, by and large, that system has worked just fine. Virtually every major USWNT star has played the college game. However, there are key flaws. The shortened fall season limits practice and game time that would be valuable to a growing player. However, in a world where women are generally not paid the multimillions that their male counterparts make, education is a key backup plan.

That's a line that Andonovski faces right now. Even with the Olympics postponed, the U.S. can likely count on the likes of Megan Rapinoe and Carli Lloyd to give them one more run. After that, Rose Lavelle and Julie Ertz can carry the torch. But the key is making this less about names and more about a system, one that churns out Rapinoes, Lloyds, Lavelles and Ertzs in each and every generation.
 And that process moves fast. When the U.S. won the World Cup in 2015, Lavelle was a junior at Wisconsin. Mallory Pugh and Tierna Davidson were 17 years old and featuring for the U.S. U-20s while Abby Dahlkemper was an NWSL rookie. In 2019, they were all among the squad that sealed glory in France.
 By the time 2023 rolls around, its a safe bet to assume that the likes of Pinto, Smith, Fox and Fishel will be pushing for their own spots, and there will be others as well. It's a system that has churned out star after star with no sign of stopping. With Markgraf's tweaks, Smith's professionalism, Andonovski's leadership and a country full of young players inspired by the USWNT's domination, it seems that next generation is being groomed for success.

Indeed, the hard-man image followed the former Republic of Ireland international throughout his career, but Evans, who came through the youth ranks at Old Trafford, was quick to note that legendary manager Sir Alex Ferguson saw Keane as far more than a bruiser.
 “Being absolutely Manchester United daft as a kid growing up in Northern Ireland, it was pretty inevitable that Roy Keane was my hero,” Evans told the club's official website.
 “What an unbelievable player he was. We had this incredible team with all these star players, and he was the leader of them all, hard as nails… he was just there to be idolised. Just this huge, influential character. I idolised him.
 “I remember when I was doing my YTS (Youth Training Scheme) at United, they’d always give us pieces of work to do. In this particular case, I think during the first year of the course, it was some material from a level two coaching course, and you had to fill in an analysis of a player.
