The Maine Football Coaches Association is trying to help promote the current seniors. The group has organized a Combine/Prospect Day to be held Oct. 3 at Fitzpatrick Stadium. A second day at a location north of Lewiston-Auburn is in the works and could soon be finalized, said Skip Capone, a longtime high school and college coach who is currently an assistant at Lewiston High. Players will be timed in the 40-yard dash and agility drills, with other football specific skills. College coaches have been invited and the sessions are expected to be videotaped, allowing for the players to send clips to coaches. High school coaches can register their players.

She is born and bred here and is an attorney. She is sensible and compassionate, willing to listen and learn. She would be a perfect candidate for CEO, but there are many others.

It's ridiculous the games that they play and the lack of efficiency all of the money that gets awarded for Grants or new programs gets wasted and squandered down by the higher-ups before anything even happens. It's pretty gosh darn pathetic to watch this happening over and over again when smaller counties arerun much more efficiently and even larger counties run fantastically well and here we are in our swirling cesspool.

“When I was out there in the ocean that day, it was really rough. We’ve had a lot of tropical storms. I noticed [Schremp] probably 50 yards away from me. He didn’t look like he was in distress, but he had no business being out there at all with the ocean conditions that day. I paddled over. Another girl said, ‘I’m in trouble. Can you help me?’ I helped her, then I paddled toward First Street,” Heidenberger said, recalling then hearing screaming and thinking someone had thought a shark was in the water.
 “There was mass panic. Everyone was running down the beach. … I got to the situation, and a lot of people were yelling for help. I got over there to him and there was no pulse, no breathing. I hadn’t been guarding, but I re-upped all my certifications, and I am eternally grateful for all that training. We couldn’t do rescue breaths on him,” he said, because of current coronavirus restrictions, but Heidenberger continued compressions and noticed the man’s lungs felt mostly clear.
 When he rolled him onto his side, not much water was expelled, but there was blood — a sign of internal bleeding.
 Emergency personnel from the Bethany Beach Volunteer Fire Department responded quickly, and lifeguards who were off duty came running to a scene that left them shaken.
 Heidenberger warned against going into the ocean when the water is churning or there are rip currents. If the water looks discolored, has a lighter color than usual and mushroom shapes, it could be dangerous, he said.
 “The lesson here is, hands down, respect the ocean. I will carry this drowning incident with me the rest of my life when I see someone doing something they shouldn’t be doing. If someone is exceeding their ocean knowledge, I will be like, ‘Have you ever seen anyone drown? Because I have. Get out of the water,’” he said.
 Capt. Darin Cathell of the Bethany Beach Police Department told the Coastal Point that Schremp had died at Beebe Healthcare on the evening of the incident, but the cause of his death had not yet been determined. It wasn’t necessarily a drowning, Cathell said, adding that Schremp could have struck his head or suffered a broken neck.

Faal was jailed for his part in the running battle which broke out on September 6 last year.
 West Midlands Police has now successfully applied for an injunction against Faal that will severely impact his activity when he eventually emerges from behind bars.
 The order bans him from Birmingham city centre and Erdington, plus stops him from hanging around with 19 named associates – men aged between 19 and 29 – who police suspect are also involved with gangs.
 Faal must provide police with details of any vehicle he owns or intends to drive, is not allowed to own more than two phones and is banned from appearing in gang-themed drill music videos.
 The injunction – under the Anti-Social Behaviour, Crime & Policing Act – was granted at Birmingham County Court on September 10 and runs until September 2023.
 Police can arrest Faal if he breaches any of the conditions.
 He was jailed for 12 weeks for breaching an interim order against him after police spotted him in a YouTube video glorifying gang violence.

"Before COVID, home care was a growing market," he says. "Now there's a shift in thinking and more policymakers ... acknowledge that home is actually the right place where care should happen."
 In June, Birdie was one of 20 startups that won a government grant to help it harness its technology for the care of elderly and vulnerable people during COVID. It is supporting NHS services by building a heat map of infection among patients using data it collects in conjunction with care providers.
 ## Birdie plans to raise a Series B round with AXA in early 2021
 Birdie raised €7 million ($8.3 million) in Series A funding from French insurance provider AXA in 2019, having previously netted a €2.5 million ($3 million) seed round from AXA's startup studio Kamet Ventures.
 By the first quarter of 2021, it wants to raise again to fund international expansion and accelerate commercial traction. AXA is already on board, but Parmentier says that Birdie wants to diversify its investors by having someone else co-lead the round.
 "I don't know how much we're going to be raising," he adds. "To be honest, it depends a bit on COVID and ... growth expectations, but with the metrics we have got right now and the depth of the market, we are going to be quite ambitious."
 Moving forward, Birdie wants to bring other care providers, such as GPs and local authorities, onto the platform and to start using internet of things (IoT) devices to improve at-home care.
 While other tech startups focus on the business-to-consumer market, Birdie operates a business-to-business model. This allows it to combine medical records and data collected from patient's homes to see the big picture, helping Birdie to improve care to a much greater extent, says Parmentier.
 "With all that data, you can actually track behavior over time and identify patterns and if you correlate that data with the data from the care providers and care workers, we're getting a very high-resolution picture of the health and well-being of these old adults at home," he says.

Cecchini says the risk of a double-dip recession are greater than investors realize, for reasons not limited to the uncertainty surrounding a COVID-19 vaccine's timing and distribution.
 He also tied the economy's prospects back to the problem of big-tech valuation. If there's continued improvement in the economy, the enthusiasm for a recovery trade that propped up these stocks could wane. And if the dreaded double-dip occurs, it would likely take these companies down with it too.
 Even after making these six observations, Cecchini acknowledges that he might be dead wrong. After all, investors who ignored stretched valuations and chose not to fight the Fed have been rewarded for their bullish convictions.
 Still, Cecchini says these risks have not vanished into thin air because the big indexes suggest otherwise.
 "Markets feel as if they are on the cusp of yet another significant risk off correlation event," he concluded.

We got into it deep. Her research was on a more visceral, experiential level. First of all, she actually did a flight simulation in a Hercules, and she simulated turning it upside down and landing it. And the pilot instructor was ‘no, you’re never going to get it, you can’t – you only just started learning’. But she was one of the most incredibly technically skilled people I’ve ever worked with; she landed that plane in the simulation! She turned it upside down and the instructor was amazed. There was a local aviation museum and an old timer took us through and she looked at the controls and at things like where you are sitting in the bomber, and we learned that if you had to pee you had to pee right there and then – where you are sitting. You sit in your pee. So that was the technical experiential research that she went through, then there was the emotional experiential research; she went to a class of new mothers in LA who were breastfeeding. It was a breastfeeding class, which isn’t all that easy to begin with – it’s harder for some women than others, and it can be tremendously traumatic when you can’t get that latch right and the baby is not into it or is having difficulty feeding. Chloe went to a breastfeeding class to talk to these women about their experiences, and when she was in Auckland for the first weeks of prep, she actually met with survivors of domestic abuse and they shared their experiences face to face with her and she listened. She took on all that experience and I think it’s all in there in some shape, and I think the film is stronger for it.

It's been hugely popular. The series continues through Oct. 11, and every show has sold out - 40 performances over 10 weekends with 50 people per performance. Tables cost $118 for two or $236 for four. But as successful as the series has been, "it's not going to scratch the surface" of the theater's financial challenges, said executive artistic director Bradford Kenney.

WhatsApp testa costantemente nuove funzionalita nel tentativo di migliorare la sua popolarissima App di chat. È stato individuato un nuovo aggiornamento che potrebbe risolvere uno dei maggiori problemi affrontati dalle persone che utilizzano la piattaforma Web di WhatsApp. Questa funzione consente agli utenti di accedere alle proprie chat tramite un browser web come Chrome o Safari. Tutto quello che devi fare e scansionare un codice QR sul tuo telefono e tutti i tuoi messaggi appariranno istantaneamente sul tuo PC. Finche il tuo dispositivo Android o iPhone e vicino e connesso al web, le chat rimangono sempre visibili sul PC. Chiaramente, se qualcun' altro inizia a utilizzare il tuo PC, puo tranquillamente dare un'occhiata furtiva ai tuoi messaggi personali senza bisogno di una password. Il nuovo aggiornamento messo a punto per questa criticita, porta all'autenticazione dell'utente tramite lo scanner di impronte digitali del telefono, prima che WhatsApp Web sia visibile.Cio accadrebbe ogni volta che il servizio viene visualizzato su un PC e dovrebbe porre fine a qualsiasi problema di sicurezza. Questa non e una funzionalita al momento confermata ed e in fase di sviluppo, e potrebbe essere accolta con grande favore da tutti gli utenti che utilizzano WastappWeb. La notizia di questo aggiornamento sulla sicurezza arriva subito dopo un altro importante aggiornamento che rendera piu facile l'invio di messaggi da diversi dispositivi. L'app di chat piu diffusa al mondo, di proprieta di Facebook, ha iniziato a testare una funzionalita chiamata "Dispositivi collegati". Come suggerisce il nome, consentira ai due miliardi di utenti di WhatsApp di aggiungere piu di un dispositivo ai propri account, il che significa che sara possibile chattare da un PC, da uno smartphone e tablet senza problemi. Questo importante aggiornamento potrebbe arrivare prima della fine dell'anno.E non e tutto perche si pensa anche che WhatsApp stia lavorando su un'altra funzionalita che rendera molto piu facile per gli utenti individuare esattamente quanto spazio sta utilizzando il contenuto dell'app sui dispositivi. Ci sara anche la possibilita di visualizzare quanto e stato inoltrato ad altre persone nei tuoi contatti e controllare le dimensioni di determinate chat. Oltre a visualizzare tutte queste informazioni, sembra che ci sara anche un modo semplice per rimuovere i file di grandi dimensioni. La nuova funzionalita chiamata Storage Usage e in fase di sviluppo e sara rilasciata con ogni probabilita entro la fine dell'anno.

In other sports, too, it is a common practice. One of the key principles of the Olympic Charter is that the national federations “must preserve their autonomy” and “resist” political pressures. In 2012, the International Olympic Committee suspended India for what was perceived by them as government interference in the running of the country’s sports bodies. FIFA, too, has similar rules.

As to Director Chandler, she left Sonoma County under a cloud, only to turn up in Mendo and take a page from Angelo - firing or marginalizing any staff member who was perceived as a threat to her power. The Supervisors need to stop allowing these power-hungry opportunists to run rough-shod over county employees, waste tax-payer monies, and fail to provide vital county services.

Clyde Frank Gross
 Sept. 13, 1935 - June 27, 2020
 NEW PLYMOUTH
 Clyde Frank Gross was very loved by his family, many grandchildren and great grandchildren. He died Saturday June 27, 2020. Family members were at his side as he let go of this world and made his way to heaven. He was 84 years old.
 Clyde was born North of Ola, Idaho at the Gross family homestead on Squaw Creek on September 13, 1935. He and his older sister attended Gross school. We heard many stories of how they crossed the river on horseback and rode over the mountain to school, staying with the teacher during the week if the weather was bad. There were other Gross families along the river as two brothers had immigrated from Germany and homesteaded in the area. The family also spent a couple years in Ohsahka, near Orofino. They sold the ranch in Ola and moved to New Plymouth. Clyde grew up riding horses, hunting and fishing, something he did a lot of during his lifetime. He left school after 9th grade to work full time. He was a big kid and often worked jobs with the men.
 Clyde married Myrna Reed in New Plymouth on January 15, 1955. He loved to tell all the grand kids that she was walking down the road, he asked if she wanted a ride, and she said only if she could drive. He worked for Carlock logging operations out of Midvale, falling trees and working green-chain. They lived in Cambridge and Homestead near Oxbow for a couple years while he worked logging jobs. Later moving to New Plymouth to raise a family and build a dairy business. Clyde and Myrna received many awards from the Dairymen’s Creamery Association. He loved hunting, sometimes taking his entire young family in a pickup to Squaw Butte, back when it was okay to stack kids on each other to fit in a single cab truck. He would get the cows milked early so there might be enough time to get to the hills and back before evening milking. One beloved Grampa story included him wrestling a bear with two of his buddies at a local traveling show one summer. We all marveled at his strength and bravery. He did tell us the bear’s teeth were pulled, but it could still bite pretty good!
 Clyde and Myrna raised 5 children while building their life as farmers and dairymen. Clyde taught many valuable life lessons to his kids, to include Holsteins are the best cows, corn needs to be knee high by 4th of July, you can make breakfast syrup with burnt sugar and water, you can’t have too many trees, and you can’t beat a beer and tomato juice on a hot summer afternoon. Other things important to Clyde included honesty, working hard, and having faith. Clyde loved attending church, and enjoyed each suspender snapping he got on Sundays from his friends. He understood God loved him and watched over him. He was a quiet man, often had a smile on his face that looked great with those blue eyes. He loved to hug his grand kids and hand out candy to little ones at church. He enjoyed making leather keychains for the church bazaar.
 He retired from the dairy in the 1990’s and farming a few years after that. He enjoyed drives with Myrna on Bluff road to count the deer and occasional turkey. His brother would take him and his sisters on drives to see local places and have dinner out, something he enjoyed greatly, never turning down a chance to go with John, and would talk about it for weeks.
 Clyde was preceded in death by his parents, an infant daughter, a brother and a sister. He is survived by his wife Myrna, and five children, Moodey Gross (Terri), Teresa Hicks (Randy), Gary Gross (Becky), Connie Gross and Scott Gross, and his many grandchildren and great grandchildren.
 Due to COVID19, the family had a small graveside celebration of life. Thank you to all who sent kind words, flowers and food. It was much appreciated by the family.

Continuing to learn the game of tennis while battling through the season, the Waverly Lady Tigers are aiming to make some noise in the conference and sectional tournaments.
 On Thursday, Sept. 3, the Lady Tigers had their first meeting of the year with Wheelersburg, suffering a 1-4 loss.
 “Once again, there was just too much match experience across the net tonight,” said Waverly coach Matt Morrison.
 Morrison said the bright spot of the night was a three-set victory in doubles by Kayla Barker and Kaelyn Linn. The duo won 6-3, 3-6, 6-4.
 “They’re undefeated playing together this year. They complement each other well,” said Morrison. “This Burg doubles team was unbeaten on the year, so it was a good win there.”
 Senior Marli Holderness dropped a close battle in No. 2 singles, falling 2-6, 5-7.
 “She fights hard and makes her opponent play well to win,” said Morrison of Holderness.
 “Sophie (Thomas) and Madison (Davis) played well at No. 2 doubles, but they started slow and couldn’t dig it out, losing 2-6, 5-7.”
 Despite the recent struggles, Morrison is proud of his players, as many are logging their first varsity seasons.
 “The girls have progressed a lot since June, but you just can’t discount match experience. It’s just one of those years, where our opponents seem to have more (experience) at about every spot, but we are competing. Now, we are looking forward to playing some of our younger players more and getting a feel for how we want to do the tournament lineup for SOC (Southern Ohio Conference) and sectional play.”
 On Tuesday, Sept. 8, the Lady Tigers bounced back with a hard-fought 3-2 win over the Minford Lady Falcons.
 “This was a great win. We were missing two starters, so we had to shift our lineup around some and play two of our new players,” said Morrison.
 The two losses came in the No. 2 and No. 3 singles matches.
 Sophie Thomas and Greenlee Thacker won at No. 1 doubles 6-1, 6-1, while Krittika Kaur and Maggi Armstrong won at No. 2 doubles 6-1, 6-2.
 “That tied the match at 2-2. Kayla (Barker) came on for No. 1 singles and won it 6-3, 6-2 to give us the win,” said Morrison.
 “We’ve struggled some and haven’t found that consistent lineup to win with yet, but tonight was a step in the right direction and a great effort, especially playing without two starters.”
 On Thursday, Sept. 10, the Lady Tigers suffered an 0-5 defeat at Notre Dame.
 “It was a tough loss, but we were missing three players,” said Morrison.
 “Kayla lost a three set battle at No. 1 singles 6-4, 6-7, 0-6. She played well and had three match points in the second set. But she came up short and ran out of gas in the third.”
 Maggi Armstrong and Maggie Harris played No. 2 and No. 3 singles for the Lady Tigers.
 “They played well and fought hard. We were proud of the effort,” said Morrison. “We knew our best chance (to win the match) was to go with Kayla at No. 1 and load our doubles teams, because we were missing people. So the Maggie and Maggi took one for the team tonight, playing their first singles matches ever.”
 Marli Holderness and Greenlee Thacker took the No. 1 doubles spot, while Sophie Thomas and Maddy Davis took No. 2 doubles.
 “Marli and Greenlee lost a tough first set tiebreak and lost the second set in a very evenly matched match 6-7, 3-6,” said Morrison. “Sophie and Maddy won the first set, but they lost second and third, 6-3, 2-6, 2-6.”
 Morrison was pleased with the effort all of his players gave.
 “We knew on the way down there tonight that we were up against it with missing people. But we can’t be upset with the overall effort tonight at all! It’s been a rough year record wise,” he said. “We are losing a lot of close matches, but our young girls are learning and the future looks bright.”
 On Tuesday, Sept. 15, the Lady Tigers traveled to Wheelersburg, falling 1-4 to the undefeated Lady Pirates. With the win, Wheelersburg improved 11-0 overall and 8-0 in the Southern Ohio Conference to take the title.
 At No. 1 singles, Kayla Barker fell 2-6, 1-6. In No. 2 singles, Marli Holderness lost 1-6, 6-7 (11-9). Kaelyn Linn picked up the lone victory, winning No. 3 singles at 6-4, 4-6, 10-8.
 In doubles competition, Sophie Thomas and Greenlee Thacker fell 0-6, 5-7 in the No. 1 match, while Maddy Davis and Emma Bellaw dropped the No. 2 match 4-6, 0-6.
 “Kayla lost to the best player in the league and got the most games anyone has all year off her. Marli battled after losing a rough first set. Kaelyn played only her second singles match, but has won them both,” said Morrison. “One doubles showed heart coming back after losing badly first set. Two doubles played well in the first set.”
 Even with the struggles, Morrison was proud of his team.
 “We competed well with lots of close sets. They just have too much experience,” said Morrison. It was a good effort, as we progress toward tournament. The girls showed a lot of heart and fight, which makes a loss easier to take.”
 On Thursday evening, the Lady Tigers suffered a close 2-3 defeat as they had two starters out of the lineup.
 “The match of the night was Marli taking Kayla’s place at No. 1 singles. Marli won first set 6-4. Then she seemed to lose her way and lost the second set badly. She was trailing 1-4 in the third before she made a great comeback to take it 7-5,” said Morrison.
 “Marli has fought hard for us all year at mainly No. 2 singles. She routinely plays the longest matches every time we play. The effort she gives is awesome. For her to step up tonight after trailing like that is great, and we were proud of her. Marli fights like crazy, and it paid off big time tonight. The way she plays and never quits is a great example to the younger players coming up that giving all you have pays off and it’s (the game) not over until it’s over.”
 The other victory came in No. 2 doubles with Maddy Davis and Maggi Armstrong taking their match.
 “Maddy has played with multiple partners all year and has been solid for us. She did great job of hitting deep crosscourt tonight and played the net well. As a coach, you’d like to keep doubles teams together most of the year. But we’ve had so many unfortunate circumstances where we’ve been short handed, we’ve had to shuffle people around a lot all season. Maddy has handled playing with multiple partners very well,” said Morrison.
 “Maggi has improved a lot since she started in the summer, too. She played well tonight, finishing points at the net and being aggressive when Maddy set her up for it. Maggi has cut down on her unforced errors and has played solid every time she’s been called in to play varsity.”
 The Lady Tigers will enjoy some home matches next week to wrap up the regular season, taking on Hillsboro Monday, Portsmouth Tuesday and Vinton County Wednesday. They will head to Unioto Thursday.
 “We are looking forward to the last week of the regular season next week and hopefully making noise in our SOC tourney as well as sectionals around the corner,” said Morrison.

Hallsville’s football team scrimmaged against R.L. Turner High School out of Carrollton on Friday night in hopes of being a little more prepared for its season opener this upcoming Friday night.
 “It was a last-minute find,” Hallsville’s first-year-head-football coach Tommy Allison said. “We had lost our previous scrimmage and we tried to find one for the three weeks and finally found one the last second, which we needed.
 “We’re still evaluating everybody so we’re just rolling people in left and right,” Allison added.
 All in all, Allison said the players and coaches are learning about each other and practice has been going well for the Bobcats.
 “It’s been going good,” he added. “The kids are having a lot of fun. We’ve just been going up against each other every day so it’s just one of those things. You can’t match game speed.”
 The Bobcats are slated to play host to the Cleburne Yellowjackets, a team that went 5-5 the last two years and just missed the playoffs a year ago, but is returning 13 starters in 2020.
 “We’ll see,” Allison said when asked if he feels like his team is prepared for Friday’s season opener. “They’re going to be good. This is their year. They’ve got a bunch of returners. They’re supposed to have a really good team. So we’ll see.”
 Allison said he’s hopeful that the season opener will help prepare his team for district play.
 “That’s the whole point,” he said. “You’ve got to play good people to get you prepared.”

For now, the boulder is teetering at the top. If the latest plan holds and the boulder doesn't tumble down, Portland Stage will resume live theater with a limited number of people in the seats in October and November when it presents a run of Lanford Wilson's "Talley's Folly," a one-act play about finding hope and joy in unlikely places during troubled times. The theater announced its plans last week, and doing so felt like a major accomplishment. "It's been intense, to say the least," Stewart said.
