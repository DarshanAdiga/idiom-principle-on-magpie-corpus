Kari and Dustin had moved into the cottage-style home in Buckhead, a northern suburb of Atlanta, on Dec. 16. After living in Georgia for four years, they decided to buy their first home together to put down roots, they said, especially after the birth of their daughter last year.
 Just a week after moving in, they left for San Diego to spend the holidays with family. But almost immediately, the couple suspected something was wrong back home.
 Somehow, the squirrel tripped the home burglary alarm.
 ADT Security Systems went out to the couple’s home to investigate. The security company found no signs of forced entry, and a friend checked on the home too, finding that the doors and windows were still locked. “We just thought it had to be a software issue,” Dustin said.
 Upon realizing the intruder was an animal — the droppings made that crystal clear — the couple called a critter control company. The serviceman found the squirrel quivering behind a couch pillow, before it “freaked out” and went rogue again, the couple said. “He made a little bed in there — it’s a comfy couch,” Dustin said.
 They aren’t sure whether they’ll be able to keep it. The couple said that “phase one” of the cleaning ended Tuesday after workers wearing hazmat suits swarmed the house and threw “sanitation bombs” everywhere. It cost $2,000, Kari said.
 Dustin said the hardest part has been understanding why the insurance company views this squirrel fiasco as being in the same boat as a rodent infestation. He said he understands why insurance may not cover typical mice or insect problems. But this seemed wildly different. “You see the commercials of the crazy things that happen, or the Allstate mayhem guy,” Dustin said. “You think these things would be covered.”
 He said he wishes a raccoon had fallen down the chimney instead.
