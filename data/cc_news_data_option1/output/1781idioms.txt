Namaste and clapping could replace handshakes and high-fives when cricket resumes after the coronavirus pandemic, India's Ajinkya Rahane said.
 Wicket celebrations might look very different post-virus, the 31-year-old batsman said, predicting many changes on and off the field.
 "I think we might go back to the good old days when fielders would still stand in their designated positions after the fall of a wicket and clap," Rahane said in an online briefing.
 "Maybe handshakes will be replaced by a namaste," he added, referring to the Indian greeting where both hands are brought together in front of the chest.
 "But once sport resumes, you can't take anything for granted. The safety of the fans will be of utmost importance. There will be changes in lifestyle while travelling."
 The COVID-19 outbreak has brought the sporting world to a halt, with the 2020 Olympics postponed for a year and cricket's richest club tournament, the Indian Premier League, delayed indefinitely.
 Rahane said the players will need around a month to prepare for their comeback, adding cricket should only return once there's a vaccine for the novel coronavirus.
 "We would be needing three to four weeks of proper practice before playing any kind of competitive game," said Rahane, speaking as brand ambassador of the ELSA (English Language Speech Assistant) app.
 "I am missing my batting. But obviously, cricket should only start when we get a vaccine to fight the virus."

Finally, by shoring up its fraying alliance with the United States and reestablishing itself as the global oil market’s swing producer, Saudi Arabia has strengthened its geopolitical position. As the major producers and consumers scrambled to prevent the oversupply of oil from overwhelming the world’s storage facilities, they finally turned to Saudi Arabia to lead OPEC and other key producers in a historic production cut. For all the talk of oil production quotas in Texas or creating a new global oil cartel through the G-20, calling Riyadh was the only real option available to policymakers at the end of the day—as it has long been. That is because Saudi Arabia has long been the only country willing to hold, at significant cost, a meaningful amount of spare production capacity that allows it to add or subtract supply to or from the market quickly. This singular position—which it just made plain once again to the world—gives the kingdom not only power over the global oil market but also significant geopolitical influence. In a global market, that will remain true until nations use much less oil, which continues to be an important goal of climate policy.

By leading the effort to craft an OPEC+ production cut, Saudi Arabia also reminded Moscow that Russia cannot go it alone, as it attempted to do when it walked out of OPEC+ negotiations in March and set off the price war. Moscow is more dependent on Riyadh in managing the oil market than vice versa, strengthening Saudi Arabia’s hand in their relationship—with likely repercussions in the Middle East, where Moscow has a growing military presence and cultivates allies including Syria and the Saudis’ archenemy, Iran.

Not only had he slept with another wrestler, but he had slept with a wrestler who happened to be one of my closest friends, who knew about my feelings for him. It was an undeniable betrayal.

Researchers around the world are racing to develop vaccines to protect against the deadly coronavirus and allow countries to rebuild teetering economies. So-called challenge studies, where treatments or preventatives are tested directly against the infection in informed volunteers, might speed the path of vaccines to the public.


  Challenge studies "can be substantially faster to conduct than vaccine field trials,” according to the working group paper, "in part because far fewer participants need to be exposed to experimental vaccines in order to provide (preliminary) estimates of efficacy and safety.”


  The report laid out eight conditions that would need to be fulfilled for challenge studies to be considered, including scientific justification, an assessment of potential benefits and the fully informed consent of subjects.


  Challenge studies hold the potential to reduce coronavirus mortality around the world but pose significant potential dangers for volunteers, scientists led by Marc Lipsitch, a Harvard School of Public Health epidemiologist, suggested in a recent paper.


  "Obviously, challenging volunteers with this live virus risks inducing severe disease and possibly even death,” they said in March in an article in the Journal of Infectious Diseases.


  Vaccines are usually tested in large groups, and the results are compared with a separate group of unvaccinated people. Waiting for both groups to become exposed to the illness in their regular daily lives can take months, while challenge studies would ensure that the subjects were promptly exposed to the virus.


  Volunteers would typically be healthy, young adults at a relatively low risk of serious disease, and would be monitored and cared for, the scientists said.


  Officials at Moderna Inc., where the lead vaccine for COVID-19 is in development, aren’t enthusiastic about the idea.


  "I’m not sure I am a huge fan of it really for both practical and ethical reasons,” said Tal Zaks, Moderna’s chief medical officer, during a presentation put on by the health news organization Stat on Wednesday. "As is often the case, the devil is in the details.”


  Zaks said he wasn’t sure that a challenge study, which could take months to design and implement, would speed development of the company’s product, which is already entering the second of three phases of study. The shot would have to prevent the development of disease, not just mild infections, or it would be hard to know if the dose picked was the right one, he said.


  The 1Day Sooner foundation has a website where people can sign up to participate in a human challenge trial for COVID-19, if one were to occur. Nearly 14,000 volunteers from 102 countries have signed up so far.

U.S. shale oil, in particular, will take years to return to its pre- coronavirus levels. Depending on how long oil demand remains depressed, U.S. oil production is projected to decline by 30 percent from its pre-coronavirus peak of around 13 million barrels per day. To be sure, recovering oil prices will raise U.S. production again. Shale oil production remains economical, especially for the better-capitalized companies that will emerge once the assets of bankrupt companies change hands and the industry is consolidated.

NEWPORT -- A mere eight months after being inaugurated as the eighth president of Salve Regina University, Dr. Kelli J. Armstrong is leading the institution's charge against a foe higher education has never before faced.
 "I feel badly for Salve that they got the rookie president through all of this," Armstrong joked during a phone conversation last Thursday. "But you see what folks are made of and how they respond to crisis. They're all in and working so hard, and the faculty really have come through for the students."
 As fears of the spread of the coronavirus grew larger, the university announced March 20 that students would not return to campus upon the end of spring break and instead would finish the semester via remote learning. The annual commencement ceremony was postponed.
 "I speak for the entire community when I tell you that our hearts go out to the Class of 2020 and those who expected to proudly celebrate with them in May," Armstrong wrote in a message to the Salve community at the time.
 Now she turns her focus to what the historic campus will look like in the fall.
 Gov. Gina Raimondo has been in contact with the presidents of all the state's colleges and universities and gave them a mid-June deadline to formulate a plan for students to safely return to campus.
 Armstrong said the presidents are working in conjunction to formulate the "best practices and guidelines," but that each institution will create a plan best suited for its campus. For example, the class sizes at Salve Regina rarely exceed 30 students, so it wouldn't have to plan for the large lecture halls a student might see at the University of Rhode Island.
 "We are going to be working in close consultation with the [Rhode Island] Department of Health and the governor to make sure whatever we do is within the state guidelines in that moment and time," Armstrong said. "We all know that things will be different around social distancing until we get a vaccine. It will mean cleaning dorm rooms and additional cleaning. Dining will look different. The best approach is to go forward with the best social-distancing measures."
 But "we plan to be open," Armstrong said. "The option of a year wait, or a two-year wait for a vaccine won't serve higher education."
 During her press briefing Saturday, Raimondo said her administration provided some parameters to colleges and universities as it relates to social distancing, testing, international students, sporting events and other events outside of the classroom, infection control and cleaning.
 "Bottom line, it's a really complicated exercise," she said in response to a reporter's question. She added that she'd have a better view once the plans are submitted in about five or six weeks.
 Armstrong said Salve more than likely will test every student who returns to campus.
 "I think we're going to have to have some form of testing, for the parents' sake who are sending their sons and daughters off to school," she said. "And we have staff of varying ages. There will have to be a system for testing to ensure our students remain healthy."
 Athletics certainly are a big part of campus life at Salve Regina, though sporting events that draw large crowds are in jeopardy. Gregg Kaye, commission of the Commonwealth Coast Conference, of which Salve is a member, said all seven NCAA Division III conferences in New England are in a "wait-and-see mode."
 "The timing and structure of our fall sports is extremely dependent on when each of our member institutions are in a position to return safely to campus and resume traditional academic environments," Kaye said in an email to The Daily News. "With our members located in three different states and numerous municipalities, it is virtually impossible to know when each college and university will return to the setting that we all miss greatly."
 He has started to explore the possibility of what a season might look like should it start two weeks late, or even a month.
 "If the situation dictates a late start and fewer games that can be played in a safe environment, the largest priority for the CCC will be the preservation of a full conference schedule and conference tournament as much as possible," Kaye said.
 Last Friday marked College Decision Day around the country, when high school seniors announce where they plan to attend school. But many students are altering those plans because of the coronavirus.
 "I'm trying to narrow down my choices, but there is no guarantee there will be college on campus this fall," Portsmouth High School senior Connor Little told The Providence Journal. "It makes me wonder, 'Why would I spend all that extra money?' I could go to the Community College of Rhode Island and get a much cheaper education there. A lot of my friends who were going to out-of-state [schools] are now signing up for CCRI."
 So how do you sell a college experience when you don't know what that experience will entail? Jim Fowler, the vice president for enrollment management, said Salve Regina is more than just a beautiful seaside campus.
 "While we are obviously very proud of our amazing campus and the fact we're in Newport, what we talk about with the Salve experience is the really mission- focused approach to higher-education," Fowler told The Daily News during a phone conversation on Friday. "We have a curriculum that prepares students for success in a rapidly changing world."
 Fowler also mentioned that Salve Regina is very "generous" when it comes to financial aid.
 In an email to The Daily News, university spokesman Matt Boxler said Salve Regina surpassed enrollment expectations during the 2019-2020 fiscal year, which would help the university absorb any financial strain should the enrollment numbers take a hit this fall.
 "I think every institution has some concerns about finances, as does every sector of the economy," Fowler said. But Salve Regina is an "institution that operates in the black when too many institutions are operating at a deficit. Financially, we're in a stable place so if the worst happens we'll still be here when it's done."
 Salve has moved its deadline for enrollment from May 1 to June 1, and decreased its deposit from $1,500 to $700. Armstrong said the university is willing to be flexible regarding the deposit.
 The incoming Class of 2024 certainly will have a story to tell about its initial college experience, but so too will the Class of 2020 on its way out the door. Armstrong said there is no set date for a proper commencement ceremony, which generally occurs outside under a tent and is dependent on the weather. She said if coronavirus concerns persist and it can't happen in the fall, it will be pushed to the spring of 2021.
 It's anyone's guess what the Salve Regina campus will look like come September.
 "I'm feeling more and more confident we'll be open and in person in the fall. We'll do all of the safety measures we need to do," Armstrong said. "For any college residents, it will look a little different and we'll still have the virus with us. But it will look much better than when we were in isolation."

However, the health center rejected the request to test his body for the coronavirus, saying the corpse is not subject to testing as it is not clear whether the man had close contact with infected people.


  Another medical institution asked a health center to test a dead man in his 30s for the virus but was also rejected. The chance that COVID-19 was the cause of death was low, but his death followed a stay at a hospital where the contagion had infected multiple people. The institution requested the test due to concerns that those who had close contact with the body during its dissection might be infected.


  On the other hand, public health centers did test 11 corpses as requested, including one of a man who was suspected to have died of pneumonia based on computerized tomography scans taken after death. All of the cases turned out negative for the virus.


  In light of the health centers' frequent rejections, legal medicine departments at several schools have begun conducting posthumous PCR tests on their own, including Chiba University, Wakayama Medical University and Nagasaki University.


  "If the deceased test positive, information of such people before their deaths can be utilized to prevent the spread of the virus, while negative results can still give reassurance to those who had contact with the patients," said Wakayama Medical University professor Toshikazu Kondo, who heads the Japanese Society for Forensic Pathology. "There should be a testing regime for corpses."

Mayor Cornell Harvey said the criticism against the city is unfair because the shooting death that has attracted national attention did not happen in city limits.
 “It did not happen in city limits but this did happen in our community,” he said. “I do not want people to think the city did nothing. No mother should have to bury her son.”
 Harvey said he spoke with Gov. Brian Kemp on Wednesday about the incident.
 “The one thing they want is swift justice,” he said. “We stand with justice. We want justice served.”
 It’s possible an emergency order to assemble a grand jury to hear the case is being considered, Harvey said.
 “The process has taken too long,” he said. “This community is trying to make sure this thing never happens in Brunswick. “This incident that happened, it’s a tragedy.”
 Commissioner Vincent Williams said he was “very, very disturbed” bu the shooting.
 “I want the Arbery family to know justice has to be served,” Williams said.
 Commissioner Felicia Harris described the shooting and response as “a travesty of justice.” Harris said she wants the public to know there a many things going on behind the scenes to ensure justice is served.

 Following a national search, Lubbock Christian University has announced the appointment of Matt Bumstead as dean of the LCU School of Business.
   
 The longtime Lubbock business professional and civic leader was selected from a field of exceptional finalists and will begin his role at the beginning of the fall 2020 semester, following the retirement of current dean, Tracy Mack, LCU announced in a news release Wednesday.
   
 In 2016, Bumstead was appointed CEO-in-Residence for the LCU School of Business with the express purpose of engaging students from the perspective of his real-world professional experiences of integrating faith into the workplace, according to LCU.
   
 The capstone class he teaches for graduating seniors draws on his expertise as a practitioner to equip LCU business students to become Christ-centered industry leaders and to advance LCU's "business as ministry" initiative.
   
 "I have an overwhelming passion for both the mission of Lubbock Christian University and the rare and priceless experience that it creates for all those students and faculty members who get to be a part of it," said Bumstead. "Work in business was never meant to be something seen as separate from the practice of our faith. At LCU, we are intensely driven toward preparing leaders who will live out a calling to serve others in the world of business, operating from the understanding that doing business God's way is very, very good business."
   
 Bumstead is an active member of the Lubbock community and is best known for his distinguished career with United Supermarkets, having served as co- president for nine years and on their board 17 years. He has also served in numerous leadership roles in organizations including Lubbock Area United Way, Lubbock Chamber of Commerce, the Texas Methodist Foundation and Lubbock Entertainment and Performing Arts Association.
   
 LCU President Dr. Scott McDowell said, "I am absolutely thrilled that Matt Bumstead has agreed to embrace this responsibility and expand his influence here at Lubbock Christian University. Even in my short time in Lubbock, I have been so impressed by Matt's keen professional insights and his incredible ability to naturally and genuinely engage students, drawing the very best out of each one of them. Everyone who knows Matt Bumstead knows that he is the right person to lead this college to even higher levels of excellence."
   
 Bumstead's diverse experience and leadership of one of Lubbock's most prominent, successful, and community-oriented businesses uniquely prepares him to lead the LCU School of Business, the largest undergraduate program in the university.
   
 Bumstead is replacing Mack, who is retiring after serving as dean of the business school for the past five years. Mack had been a member of the business school faculty for 20 years before his tenure as dean. The Tracy Mack Legacy Endowed Scholarship has been set up to honor Mack and to benefit business students.

PEMBROKE -- Charlie's Too Restaurant in Pembroke is a South Shore seafood staple, but co-owners Peter Housos and Jim Spinale say they wouldn't have been able to stick around this long if it weren't for the continued support they've received from their community, especially in this time of crisis.
 The restaurant goes all the way back to 1959 when Charlie's Snack House opened on the beach in Brant Rock in Marshfield, Housos said. The restaurant did well, which lead the owner, who was, in fact, named Charlie, to open a second location in Pembroke in the early 1990s.
 Soon after opening the new restaurant, Housos said, a storm greatly damaged the original restaurant beyond repair, and the owners were left with Charlie's Too in Pembroke.
 In 2006, after decades working the restaurant industry in Boston, Housos and Spinale began looking for a place near where they lived in Norwell. They found Charlie's Too was selling, and decided to go for it, cooking and operating it all by themselves.

 "It was basically a clam shack, but we brought our own vision," Spinale said.
 The pair made cosmetic improvements, like putting in a bar and redecorating. But they also added some specialty dishes, like a seafood stew, their own unique chili, lobster bisque and old school clam chowder. Housos and Spinale said they take great pride in their food.
 "If I wouldn't eat it, I wouldn't serve it. That's how I look at," Housos said.
 In 2012, the pair was offered the building and bought it, which was a big step for them. Housos said it's been wonderful to work for themselves and own their own place, and that they've received a lot in return.
 "We've been rewarded with incredible staff and great, devoted clientele," he said. "We're the fortunate ones."
 Even though they were new management, Housos and Spinale said they've kept a strong connection to the South Shore community all these years, still seeing customers who remember going to the original restaurant on the beach.
 But like all other restaurants, Charlie's Too couldn't escape the hardship caused by the coronavirus outbreak. Housos and Spinale said it caused them to have to completely change the way they operate.
 "Things change on a daily basis, so you don't know what's going to happen one day to the next," Housos said. "You have to be able to adjust on the fly."
 Charlie's Too began by offering a limited menu, changing the number of days they were open and operating hours, but the challenges went beyond that. They had to figure out how to do everything with masks on, how to make orders entirely takeout, get used to doing every payment by card over the phone, how to do curbside pick up and manage the huge influx of calls.
 "This isn't takeout as normal, this is takeout COVID-19," Spinale said.
 The restaurant was also approved for a federal small business loan, but was one of thousands of businesses that did not receive the money because it ran out so quickly. They may still receive the money with the new stimulus package, but even so, in response, they posted on Facebook on April 18 to vent their frustration and let customers know what was going on.
 "I've heard all my life how small businesses are the 'bread & butter' to this country - I'm not feeling it!" Housos wrote.
 To their surprise, Housos and Spinale said the response to the post was hugely supportive. The next few days, business boomed, and customers went out of their way to show their love.
 "I think it just resonated. I think people really wanted to rally and it was actually very uplifting and energizing to know that we had that kind of support," Housos said. "It really gave us that extra fuel to keep moving on."
 Now, they said, they just take it day by day, and stay grateful for what they have.
 "There were 500 people who offered words of encouragement, but there was also dozens of people that posted that they're in the same situation that we're in," Housos said. "If anything, I learned from that post that we're not alone. There's a lot of people worse off than we are. At least we're open and we've got some business coming in."

GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) - A set of detailed documents created by the nation’s top disease investigators meant to give step-by-step advice to local leaders deciding when and how to reopen public places such as mass transit, day care centers and restaurants during the still-raging pandemic has been shelved by the Trump administration. The 17-page report by a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention team, titled "Guidance for Implementing the Opening Up America Again Framework," was researched and written to help faith leaders, business owners, educators and state and local officials as they begin to reopen. It was supposed to be published last Friday, but agency scientists were told the guidance "would never see the light of day," according to a CDC official. The official was not authorized to talk to reporters and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.The AP obtained a copy from a second federal official who was not authorized to release it. The guidance was described in AP stories last week, prior to the White House decision to shelve it.The Trump administration has been closely controlling the release of guidance and information during the pandemic spurred by a new coronavirus that scientists are still trying to understand, with the president himself leading freewheeling daily briefings until last week.Traditionally, it's been the CDC's role to give the public and local officials guidance and science-based information during public health crises. During this one, however, the CDC has not had a regular, pandemic-related news briefing in nearly two months. CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield has been a member of the White House coronavirus task force, but largely absent from public appearances.The dearth of real-time, public information from the nation's experts has struck many current and former government health officials as dangerous."CDC has always been the public health agency Americans turn to in a time of crisis," said Dr. Howard Koh, a Harvard professor and former health official in the Obama administration during the H1N1 "swine flu" pandemic in 2009. "The standard in a crisis is to turn to them for the latest data and latest guidance and the latest press briefing. That has not occurred, and everyone sees that."The Trump administration has instead sought to put the onus on states to handle COVID-19 response. This approach to managing the pandemic has been reflected in President Donald Trump's public statements, from the assertion that he isn't responsible for the country's lackluster early testing efforts, to his description last week of the federal government's role as a "supplier of last resort" for states in need of testing aid.White House spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany echoed that at a briefing Wednesday. "We've consulted individually with states, but as I said, it's (a) governor-led effort. It's a state-led effort on ... which the federal government will consult. And we do so each and every day." The rejected reopening guidance was described by one of the federal officials as a touchstone document that was to be used as a blueprint for other groups inside the CDC who are creating the same type of instructional materials for other facilities. The guidance contained detailed advice for making site-specific decisions related to reopening schools, restaurants, summer camps, churches, day care centers and other institutions. It had been widely shared within CDC, and included detailed "decision trees," flow charts to be used by local officials to think through different scenarios. One page of the document can be found on the CDC website via search engines, but it did not appear to be linked to any other CDC pages. Some of the report's suggestions already appear on federal websites. But the guidance offered specific, tailored recommendations for reopening in one place. For example, the report suggested restaurants and bars should install sneeze guards at cash registers and avoid having buffets, salad bars and drink stations. Similar tips appear on the CDC's site and a Food and Drug Administration page.But the shelved report also said that as restaurants start seating diners again, they should space tables at least 6 feet apart and try to use phone app technology to alert a patron when their table is ready to avoid touching and use of "buzzers." That's not on the CDC's site now."You can say that restaurants can open and you need to follow social distancing guidelines. But restaurants want to know, 'What does that look like?' States would like more guidance," said Dr. Marcus Plescia, chief medical officer of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials. The White House's own "Opening Up America Again" guidelines released last month were more vague than the CDC's unpublished report. They instructed state and local governments to reopen in accordance with federal and local "regulations and guidance," and to monitor employees for symptoms of COVID-19. The White House guidance also included advice developed earlier in the pandemic that remains important like social distancing and encouraging working from home. A person close to the White House's coronavirus task force said the CDC documents were never cleared by CDC leadership for public release. The person said that White House officials don't want to offer detailed guidance for how specific sectors can reopen, calling it a "slippery slope" because the virus is affecting various parts of the country differently.CDC is hearing daily from state and county health departments looking for scientifically valid information with which to make informed decisions. Still, behind the scenes, CDC scientists like those who produced the guidance for "Opening Up America Again" are working to get information to local governments. The agency still employs hundreds of the world's most respected epidemiologists and doctors, who in times of crisis are looked to for their expertise, said former CDC director Tom Frieden. People have clicked on the CDC's coronavirus website more than 1.2 billion times. States that directly reach out to the CDC can tap guidance that's been prepared, but that the White House has not released yet."I don't think that any state feels that the CDC is deficient. It's just the process of getting stuff out," Plescia said.___Stobbe reported from New York.

The beginning of May is usually an exciting time for students. Seniors count the days until graduation; younger kids look forward to vacation and camps.
   
 School's out for summer!
   
 This year, by contrast, ends with a shrug.
   
 Amid a COVID-19 scare, public schools across Florida have been closed since March as school districts finish the year online. "Distance learning" programs were cobbled together on the fly, a labor of necessity. And while this instruction is better than nothing, many parents and students are finding it underwhelming at best.
   
 Across the country some districts are choosing to end the year early rather than continue with distance learning.
   
 Some students, for whatever reason, aren't applying themselves as they would in the classroom; and in some poorer communities, many students aren't logging on at the same rate as wealthier children.
   
 None of this should be seen as a reflection on educators, who have struggled to make it work. And cyber-learning might be optimal for some students. But many others fare better -- academically, emotionally, physically -- surrounded by their peers in a classroom with a teacher up front commanding their attention and orchestrating their efforts.
   
 This spring, students had to forgo this.
   
 It may leave a lasting impact.
   
 Could the effects of COVID-19 slow the academic progress of this generation of students? To what extent will the disruption manifest itself in reading progress, mathematical ability and standardized test scores?
   
 Gov. Ron DeSantis has said Florida parents will have the option of keeping their children in the same grade if they're not ready to move on. Many parents throughout our region are beginning to have those conversations, wondering how to balance their childrens' academic and social needs, how their sons and daughters might react if their friends move up but they don't.
   
 Local school districts are discussing summer programs that might help prepare students for the 2020-21 school year. This could help, but if those programs are voluntary rather than mandatory, many students who need the extra instruction the most might not benefit.
   
 And all of this is to assume students will be able to return to brick-and- mortar classrooms in the fall, that this experiment in distance learning will soon end.
   
 If it doesn't, if the kids are online again in the fall, even more ground may be lost.
   
 This week, the Florida Department of Education launched a survey asking parents and teachers how the pandemic has impacted their lives. The survey asks primarily about respondents' comfort with students returning to campus.
   
 Responses might help shape the length of the 2020-21 school year. But so much more needs to be done.
   
 Local school districts remain mostly in reactive mode, trying to finish out this chaotic year. That's understandable, and we know they are planning.
   
 We don't pretend to know exactly what that looks like at. But the discussions -- at both the local and state levels -- can't happen soon enough.

It is actually not uncommon among men — even though it is rarely discussed. I had been on a nine-month physical journey of connecting with Birdie: My body was transforming to accommodate her, in real time. He had nothing physical to attach to — he just had books, and he read a lot of them. But no book can prepare you for the real thing — for this tiny, needy creature who has wants and needs that you have to learn on the fly.”

THE Warwick community is still reeling from the shock of the sudden passing of Neville French, a renowned local “character”,


  Neville died at Warwick Hospital on Saturday night, losing his battle with glioblastoma, the most aggressive form of brain cancer after only six weeks.


  Once the news of his passing reached the wider community, dozens of residents took to social media to share their memories of Neville.


  “You were a kind face around town and your quick handshake usually caught me off guard, but was nice in a world where there aren’t many people willing to grab your hand,” Warwick resident Alana Hurse wrote.


  “We would often see Neville walking around so smartly dressed or on the park bench and thought how content he seemed with his routine each day and just having a random chat,” added the Abbey of the Roses Facebook page.


  Neville’s sister Deborah Joy said their final goodbyes were difficult but tranquil.


  “We were with him throughout everything, it was so special and peaceful,” Ms Joy said.


  “I cannot praise the Warwick (Hospital) staff enough for the compassion with which they cared for Neville.


  “I’m so proud of him, because he really had to work hard to accept that this is life, and his beautiful heart and soul just kept on exuding through it all.”


  Ms Joy said Neville had a myriad of hobbies growing up and spent much of his adolescence around the Sandy Creek area, trying everything from school sports and fishing to origami and theatre productions.


  However, he was probably best known throughout the Warwick community for his “spiffy” sense of style and stopping anyone walking past his park bench in town to have a chat.


  “He was all about enjoying life — always sharing with others to take it easy and relax,” Ms Joy said.


  “He loved wearing a vest and tie whenever he went out, no matter what, he loved it and always complimented others.


  “He loved keeping fresh, doing his hair, and always looking spiffy — a man of distinction and style was our Nevie.”


  Warwick resident John Walsh agreed, saying that he and Neville forged a unique friendship over the years.


  “He was another character around town, always saying g’day to people and shaking your hand and everything,” Mr Walsh said.


  “He was always having lays on the benches along the street – outside our store, outside the bank, and outside the post office.


  “He was always dressed up, and he was always happy, so I think everyone could learn a little bit from him.”


  Ms Joy said the outpouring of memories from Neville’s fellow community members was “touching”.


  “It’s just amazingly beautiful what the Warwick community has done for Nevie, our baby brother,” she said.


  “He was the most considerate, courageous, and brave soul, and he made Warwick his stage.”


  Neville’s funeral service will be streamed online on Tuesday, May 12.

With the Xbox Series X and PS5 launching later in the year – at a presumably higher cost than its predecessors, and less units being available at launch – EA will be releasing its upcoming games with cross-gen capabilities that will allow players to purchase a game on current-gen consoles and play it while they wait to get their hands on a next-gen console. Once they’ve got their new consoles sorted, they will be able to port the game over from their existing machines to the new one for free.
