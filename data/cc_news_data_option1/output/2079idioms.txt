Having opened up a 25-point lead at the top of the table, Jurgen Klopp’s side are just two wins away from confirming their coronation as the kings of English football.


  In the middle of March, the expectation was that they would cross that line with the minimum of fuss.


  A coronavirus-enforced break has, however, left Liverpool sweating on when, or if, they will ever get their hands on that much-coveted piece of silverware.


  Project Restart is now being stepped up, as competitive football prepares to return to the calendar, and Robertson is looking forward to tying up loose ends – even if that task must be completed behind closed doors.


  The Scotland international full-back told Liverpool’s _official website_: “It’s been 30 long years for this club and the fans probably couldn’t have imagined we’d have to wait nine weeks when we were so close to going into games where we hopefully could have won to seal the Premier League title.


  “But we’ll get back to it, we’ll get going again, we’ll get our rhythm again and hopefully we can win the games we need to win and that’s what our aim is now.


  “The light at the end of the tunnel was just getting back into training, to be honest. At times, there were some days you didn’t think that would have been possible, but now we’re back here, we can look forward and look to the next step. Then, like I said, hopefully with the games we’ve got ahead of us, we can get back to it.


  “Would we like to play in front of 55,000 people at Anfield? Of course we would. Winning games or whatever without the fans won’t feel the same, but it’s something we know we need to go through and it’s something we know that in their houses and stuff they will be supporting us like mad and we’ll feel that support.


  “Hopefully we can celebrate a title if we get the job done – and there will be time to celebrate it when the time is right. But for now we need to keep focused, we know whatever games are coming up and whenever they start, we need to get them won and get that trophy for this club.”

TIRUPATI: A short take-off ramp, perfect wind conditions and a brave heart is all that is required to hop onto the co-pilot’s seat of a paramotoring cart. In the next few minutes, the whirr of the motor drowns external noise giving enough thrust for take-off, followed by a mesmerising bird’s eye view of the city.


  After the recent ‘trial run’ of Hot Air Ballooning activity, introduced by AP Tourism during the 104th Indian Science Congress, it is now the turn of paramotoring (powered paragliding) and parasailing, a form of ultralight aviation and adventure activity, to make its mark in the temple city. New Delhi-based National Adventure Foundation was roped in by S.V. Defence Academy to introduce the same for the latter’s students.


  Well-trained pilots


  “After successful runs at the Kakinada Beach Festival and Vijayawada, we wanted to showcase the same, here. Our pilots are well trained with international certifications. The response so far has been amazing and there is an immense tourism potential for the activity, particularly in a pilgrimage destination like Tirupati,” said C.V. Surya Teja, Deputy Director of the National Adventure Foundation in Andhra Pradesh.


  Speaking to The Hindu, Mr. Teja further elucidated on details of paramotoring/parasailing activities and said that they would be able to organise 40-50 trips for 15 minutes each, reaching an altitude of 600 feet or more depending on the wind and temperature conditions. “A wind speed of maximum 10 knots would be favourable and we can climb till 10,000 feet. But, for safety reasons we vary the altitude range. The weight capacity also changes according to the person and other climatic factors,” he added.


  S.V. Defence Academy Director B. Sesha Reddy said this activity would encourage the students willing to join the armed forces and motivate them to succeed in their endeavours. ‘Paramotoring joy rides’ will be available for the students of S.V. Defence Academy till January 27 at the Thummalagunta grounds.

Two weeks on since the German Constitutional Court issued its momentous ruling on the ECB’s quantitative easing programme, commentators are still wondering what kind of bomb has been detonated by the German Court. Will the blast bring down the Euro along with the European Union? Or will a makeshift arrangement of some sort allow the EU to kick the can down the road and muddle through, at least until the next crisis flares up? Whether the ruling ends up triggering a much-feared thermonuclear chain reaction marking the end of the European project will depend in large part on the response of other EU and German institutions and their ability to persuade the judges in Karlsruhe that the PSPP meet their exacting proportionality test.

Nine years on from Barcelona's breath-taking Champions League final victory over Manchester United, the memory still rankles with Rio Ferdinand. Wembley bore witness to one of the most scintillating team performances in the competition's long, distinguished history – capped by the individual heroics from Messi, who confirmed his status as the world's finest player on that May evening in London.


  “Messi was a killer,” the ex-England defender, no mean player in his own right, recalled to _Copa 90_. “Ronaldinho was unreal, the free-flowing magician. But with Messi, he’d do all of that but there was always a goal or an assist at the end of it.”


  Nobody could claim that United did not have fair warning going into the decider. Just two years previously Barcelona, stewarded by Pep Guardiola and featuring the double threat of Xavi and Andres Iniesta at their very best, had dispatched the Red Devils 2-0 at the Stadio Olimpico to win their third Champions League title; a game that featured that rarest of beasts, a header from Messi.


  Under Guardiola the Catalans had honed the concept of possession football into a near-artform, with Xavi and Iniesta's intricate passing supported by Messi's wizardry and the punching bursts of Dani Alves from the right. That potent mix had seen Barca crowned Spanish champions by four points over Jose Mourinho's Real Madrid, suffering defeat on just two occasions and inflicting a famous 5-0 thrashing on their arch-rivals.


  It was not infallible, however. The previous season Mourinho had shown how to blunt Barca's attacking force with a tour de force of defensive football over two legs as Inter prevailed in the Champions League semi-finals. The abrasive Portuguese coach also got the better of Guardiola in the Copa del Rey, taking the trophy in extra-time thanks to Cristiano Ronaldo's extra-time winner.


  Sir Alex Ferguson, of course, was cut from a different footballing cloth than the man many claim he desired as his successor at Old Trafford. United, therefore, went out at Wembley to beat the Blaugrana at their own game, pressing high and crowding out any attempts to get those dizzying passing triangles up and running.


  For the first 10 minutes at least they were successful, with Park Ji-sung giving Messi and Alves more than food for thought as he harried and harassed. Guardiola appeared more than a little concerned on the bench.


  But if United were hoping that early discomfort would set the tone in the final, they were to be sorely disappointed. Once Barca found their rhythm and, most importantly, Xavi, they took a firm hold of the game that they refused to release.

Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) general secretary P. Muralidhar Rao has accused the Left Democratic Front (LDF) government of building a case against itself by abetting violence against his partymen in the State.


  After calling on Governor P. Sathasivam to submit a memorandum about the increasing instances of political violence involving the CPI(M) and the BJP in the State on Wednesday, Mr. Rao told reporters that the State government, by failing to maintain peace, was forcing the Centre to explore all options, including deployment of Central forces.


  Asked whether the Centre would impose President’s rule in the State, Mr. Rao reiterated that by abetting CPI(M) violence to stem the flow of Dalits and other indigent sections to the BJP, the State government was forcing the Centre to act.


  Chief Minister Pinaryi Vijayan should come of age and prevent such instances. He should take the lead to end the violence, Mr. Rao said.


  Mr. Rao, who visited Kannur, said the victims of political violence were the Dalits and indigent sections. The CPI(M) had started targeting women and children. Violence and murder had spread to the capital too. Still, Mr. Vijayan had not taken any action, he said.


  The peace negotiations and all-party meetings lacked commitment and sincerity as the CPI(M) workers continue violence amidst talks. The BJP and RSS have asked its workers to exercise restraint. The CPI(M) cannot stop the Dalits and minority communities from joining the BJP by perpetrating violence, he said.


  The memorandum submitted to Mr. Sathasivam details the deaths two RSS men at Kanjikode, a BJP worker at Andallur in Kannur, and various attacks on party workers, mainly Minority Morcha general secretary Aisha Sherin at Nemom. It accused the CPI(M) of upsetting peace in the State and sought his intervention.


  Mr. Rao said the Governor gave a sympathetic hearing to the BJP delegation that comprised O. Rajagopal, MLA, and K. Surendran, among others.

ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) — Anchorage property tax bills have increased over the last year largely because of a school bond funding veto by Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy. The increase is related to a transfer of school bond debt reimbursement burden from the state to local taxpayers, The Anchorage Daily News reported Wednesday. The bills issued May 1 vary based on the city area of each taxpayer’s property, with an average of $1,675 per $100,000 of property. A homeowner with a house valued at $350,000 had a property tax increase of $168. The Anchorage Assembly approved a request from Mayor Ethan Berkowitz to delay payment deadlines by a month due to the coronavirus pandemic. The first payment is due in July instead of June, with the second payment due in September instead of August. The transfer of school bond debt liability will cost $48 per $100,000 of property value. The state operated a program for decades covering half or more of the amount of local school bonds. Dunleavy's budget proposal in 2019 cut the funding. The Legislature passed a package that included full school bond debt reimbursement, but Dunleavy eliminated half of that using his veto, which the Legislature failed to override. The change put about $20.5 million in debt service onto Anchorage taxpayers. The Anchorage School District found about $4 million to offset the cut, leaving $16.5 million to be covered by property taxpayers. “That was a significant jump,” Anchorage’s Office of Management and Budget Director Lance Wilber said. Dunleavy planned to use money from federal coronavirus relief funds to replace money he vetoed from the state budget, allocating more than $560 million to cities and boroughs. There has not yet been clear guidance on whether federal rules allow the funding to be...

Home-improvement services in the Erie area are working to make up for lost time, and in some cases lost opportunity, after the COVID-19 outbreak shut down their operations and put the projects their customers desired on hold for a time.


   


  But the return hasn't come without some level of frustration for the businesses.


   


  Erie-based Braendel Painting & Services Inc. and Great Lakes Construction were each enjoying a higher-than-normal volume of business at the start of 2020 before they were forced to stop work because of COVID-19-related restrictions in mid-March, their owners said.


   


  "We were able to do a few emergency things, but not much of anything. To go from full staff to nothing was kind of shocking. There were definitely some uneasy times," said Dennis Braendel of Braendel Painting & Services Inc.


   


  Mark Tarasovich of Great Lakes Construction said the shutdown was unfortunate but really didn't slow the company down. The company resumed work on May 4 and was busy with appointments that first week, he said.


   


  "I'd almost compare it like a weather delay," Tarasovich said. "So for us, we're excited, we're glad to be back. People are looking to buy, so for us it's been fairly positive, other than the delay."


   


  He said he is not sure what is driving the continued strong business for home-improvement services from his company, but thinks people still need roofing, windows, doors and siding.


   


  Braendel, whose company quickly lined up a number of painting, roofing and interior renovation jobs after reopening on May 1, is equally at a loss to explain the boom.


   


  "We found that a lot of people are still wanting things done. I don't know if it is because of the time they spent cooped up and were looking around the house. I don't know if they are not planning on going on vacation and would rather put the money into their house," Braendel said.


   


  Andy Vinca, the owner of Angelo's Roofing & Construction Inc. in Erie, was able to keep a few of his 25 employees working during the outbreak to do emergency repairs as permitted under the restrictions.


   


  But Vinca said that, while his company was following all of the guidelines, there were others who didn't follow them and were still doing whole-roof projects.


   


  "Our guys have been great, and we were able to stay open," said Vinca, whose company resumed full operations on May 4. "We have a lot of work lined up, our 25 guys are back to work, and we're happy to be working."


   


  At J's Flooring Center, which has two locations in Erie, its owners spent the days before reopening on May 11 scrambling to get supplies that were put on hold and to touch base with customers waiting for work to advance.


   


  It was frustrating that big home-improvement retailers like Home Depot and Lowe's were able to sell flooring during the outbreak while J's Flooring couldn't, said Jason Hines, an owner.


   


  "We're putting the pieces together," he said.


   


  The frustration for Sam Catania Jr. of Sam Catania Painting was in not knowing when he and his 30 employees could go back to work.


   


  He said his business was told to shut down on March 16, and finally got word from the state that it could reopen the week of May 10.


   


  As he waited for the official go-ahead, Catania said he fielded "a ridiculous amount" of calls from people wanting painting jobs done.


   


  "We have some people that we lost jobs because we can't get in quick enough," he said. "It's been really difficult."

  He said police had expressed their inability to provide adequate security to the actors in the court on account of the presence of the Chief Minister and the Governor in the city for Republic Day celebrations.

BILLINGS, Mont. — Americans settled for small processions and online tributes instead of parades Monday as they observed Memorial Day in the shadow of the pandemic, which forced communities to honor the nation’s military dead with modest, more subdued ceremonies that also remembered those lost to the coronavirus.


  On the weekend that marked the unofficial start of summer, authorities warned people heading to beaches, parks or backyard barbecues to heed social- distancing rules to avoid a resurgence of the disease that has infected 5.4 million people worldwide and killed over 345,000, including nearly 100,000 Americans, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University.


  Memorial Day commemorations were canceled or toned down across the country. Veterans, along with nursing home residents, have made up a significant portion of those who died in the U.S. outbreak.

There are a few guiding principles worth considering before you overclock a CPU. First, not all processors can be easily overclocked. If you’re Team AMD, you’re probably in luck, as all modern Ryzen processors can be overclocked in B- and X-series AM4 motherboards. Intel, however, locks most of its mainstream CPUs to prevent smart users from purchasing a budget component and jacking up its performance. Pricier enthusiast processor lines (identified by a K or X suffix, such as the Intel Core i5-10600KRemove non-product link), on the other hand, are sold unlocked and can therefore be overclocked.


  Even then, bear in mind that processors are unique slabs of silicon and electronics. Some processors can tolerate higher operating speeds better than others—even those of the same model and specification. It’s known as the “silicon lottery” for a reason!


  Stable overclocks entail a delicate balance of speed and heat. The more you push your processor, the hotter it’s going to get. If your PC becomes a little _too_ toasty, integrated fail-safe measures should shut off the power before those expensive components are damaged. To keep your overclocked PC stable, your job is to keep it cool.

  “Of course, we can have less people, so that the flow of people is made easier,” the French tennis federation’s general director, Jean-François Vilotte, told The Associated Press on Wednesday, when about 10 media members were allowed to tour Chatrier. “The options range from a very small reduction to the number of fans to various levels of reduction.”


  Or no fans at all.


  That, Vilotte said, would be a last resort.


  “We are considering all the options. But we obviously prefer not to play behind closed doors. We want there to be fans there, fans who respect precautionary measures,” Vilotte said. “I have a hard time understanding why restaurants and shops are allowed to re-open, but we can’t do so at a big event like ours.”


  The French federation would, of course, face significant revenue losses — tickets, hospitality, food and drink, merchandise — if no fans are allowed. As it is, those who bought tickets for the tournament’s original dates — last Sunday until June 7 — already were offered refunds.

Back in the old days, after war, for example, you buy time for the economy to reset by printing money in a way that in effect cancels the value of old unrepayable debts, the value of pools of earned but inconveniently placed existing money while keeping things busy until the moment the situation is sufficiently reset you can cancel the old money entirely and introduce a new currency which is then, hopefully, not put back through the inflation process. Don’t imagine for a minute inflation or deflation is not policy. If you think that Zimbabwe can organize inflation but the denizens of the Bank of Japan can’t, then think again.

COVID-19 or no COVID-19, election time is slowly approaching and local and state offices are up for grabs. Whether or not you can vote by mail or hopefully in person, terms for various offices are due for the next few years.


  In the past I have written several letters for the candidate of Clerk of the Courts, Jerome Kaszubowski, and I am now writing another to show support and encourage all of you voters to put this man in the office that he has been a deputy clerk for over 30 years. It stands to reason that with this much experience, Jerome is the most qualified candidate, as he can simply move on with the many issues of county problems that he has been working on.


  A solid family man, he has also been instrumental in many countywide programs and has held a position of authority in many county functions. He is the former president and board member of the Heartland Christian School (now known as Heartland Christian Academy) and is an executive member of the Highlands Republican Committee.


  Married for close to 30 years, wife Margaret, three children Seth, Kayla and Hanna, along with five grandchildren show a stable and firm commitment to the job of Clerk of the Courts and the people of Highlands County.

ARIYALUR: Work on the construction of a check-dam near Kallagam on the border of Tiruchi and Ariyalur districts has been completed. Though the monsoon has failed, the check-dam has been capable of storing even the meagre water realised during the short spell due to Vardah cyclone.


  The water would be stored not only during floods but also during sudden downpour or incessant rain.


  The work forms part of 14 check-dams at an estimate of a little over ₹20 crore with funds from the Public Works Department and the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development’s Rural Infrastructure Development Fund.


  Official sources said that the check-dams had been designed across the Uppar Vari at K. Periyapatty of Manapparai taluk; Ponnaniyar in Manapparai taluk; Ayyar at Thandalaiputhur of Musiri taluk; Kattaru at Kumbakudi of Tiruverumbur taluk and Panguni Vaikkal at Sirumarudhur in Lalgudi taluk, Kothamangalam Vari at Alundur in Srirangam taluk; Nandiyar in Vandalai – Gudalur of Lalgudi taluk; Maanodai at Melarasoor of Lalgudi taluk; Uppar at Devimangalam of Manachanallur taluk; Shanmughanadhi at Thirupattur of Manachanallur taluk; Vellar at Vembanur of Marungapuri taluk; Kannuthu Odai at Kumaravadi of Manapparai taluk; Mamundiyar at Samudram of Manapparai taluk; Koraiyur at Karuppur in Manapparai taluk.


  The dams would essentially serve as an artificial recharge structure preventing water from going waste during sudden downpour. It would hold water thereby augmenting groundwater table and providing water for livestock and villagers, according to NABARD sources.

The days of rescuing horses in fields, people in homes and kittens at Washington County SPCA from ever rising flood waters are still close in the memory banks for Washington County residents who watched the Caney River and area creeks rise up to overtake the land in May 2019.


   


  The whole experience is more than a memory for Kary Cox, Washington County Emergency Management director, who is still trying to navigate cost estimates and repairs for infrastructure in some parts of the county that remain saturated to the core a year later. The rainy spring of 2019 turned into a rainy year that has continued into 2020. The crisis point hit May 21, 2019, and continued for a week, but the difficulties are ongoing today.


   


  "We are still not done yet (with last year's flood)," Cox said. "We don't have a total yet on damage. A lot of those areas we have not been able to get in there to get estimates and make repairs because it is still so saturated."


   


  In Bartlesville alone, more than 80 structures were damaged as the mighty Caney overflowed its banks ultimately cresting at 19.1 feet. The water had nowhere to go for a while, so it stuck around. Some roads in the Copan Lake area were underwater for close to 60 days. Soft spots in those roads continue to appear as the impact of water damage makes itself known, Cox said.


   


  Meanwhile, in the southern part of the county, a bridge remains washed out and road repairs cannot be completed because the ground remains too saturated. Crews will come in and put gravel down in some spots, but everything washes away before more work can be completed, Cox said.


   


  For some residents, there is a longer, winding road to home all these months later. There might be an extra five to six miles in their commute until a needed bridge replacement is completed.


   


  "We've got a couple of places that people are suffering a lot of inconvenience," Cox said. "They are not cut off, but they have to take the scenic route to get there."


   


  When the actual intense flooding began in May 2019, numerous area roads were closed for varying amounts of time, including Oklahoma 123. The SPCA office and shelter, located on the state highway between Bartlesville and Dewey in an area prone to flooding, received an evacuation notice from the county at 1:26 a.m. An appeal went out to volunteers and board members and the race was on to get all the pets safely evacuated and moved. Some went to Tulsa, some ultimately to Illinois and others were moved to a temporary shelter location on U.S. 75.


   


  In Bartlesville, water rose rapidly in neighborhoods on the northwest side of the city, as well as in areas near Hillcrest Country Club. Some were stranded in their homes, watching water take over the streets. Others had to leave their houses and return later to see damage was created by the onslaught of flooding.


   


  Throughout the region, county officials stayed busy making water rescues involving both people and animals.


   


  "We did quite a bit of that last year," Cox recalled. "We did water rescues in Bartlesville, Ramona, Vera, Oglesby, even some in Osage county west of Bartlesville."


   


  The dams at both Hulah and Copan lakes were monitored carefully as water poured out in torrents.


   


  It was June before a sense of normalcy returned to Bartlesville after the 2019 flooding. Baseball games were resuming, Kiddie Park reopened on June 4, Johnstone Park reopened on June 11. The drying out continued interspersed with rainy bouts. The cleaning up continued until all that could be done was completed.


   


  "We had flooding from the Kansas state line to the south end of this county," Cox said. "The homes that could be repaired and reoccupied, they are back in. We had homes in Bartlesville and a few out in the county that were significantly damaged and destroyed."

The immunization data is compiled from the Florida SHOTS system, the statewide online immunization information system initially designed to help health care providers — — as well as public and private schools and child-care providers — — keep track of children’s immunization records.


  While a growing number of people are refusing to vaccinate their children in the state, Richards-Rowley attributed the precipitous drop to the cancellation of pediatrician appointments during the pandemic. Her office has remained open and made changes to keep patients safer, such as eliminating the waiting-room area. Nevertheless, some parents rescheduled appointments for June or July, and others just didn’t show up. About three weeks ago, more than half of the appointments were canceled or rescheduled, she estimated. Now, that figure is closer to about 25 percent.


  “People are honestly scared and with good reason. All the information coming out not only from China and Europe and New York and where have you,” she said. “And now the information about (multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, or MIS-C) where the kids may have no symptoms but a month or two months later have a wicked rash and get very sick. It’s a frightening time, and we try to encourage them but it is still pretty scary for most people.”


  Before he issued his stay-at-home order, DeSantis on March 20 issued an executive order directing that all non-essential health care services be halted as the state tried to conserve personal protective equipment and hospital space in case of a COVID-19 surge. The governor in recent weeks has reopened parts of the economy and gave the green light in May for health providers to resume all procedures.

Living in abject penury, Revathi’s only concern was to arrange for two square meals a day. She lost her parents at the age of four and was brought up by her grandmother Arammal, a daily wage labourer. Even though Arammal struggled to feed the young girl, she did not stop from encouraging her. “My grandma was always behind me during tough times. She never dissuaded me from playing,” says Revathi.


  It was Arammal who sensed Revathi’s zeal in sports and egged her on to take up athletics. Revathi studied in government school and won medals for her school. She was spotted by Kannan when he noticed Revathi running barefooted on the roads regularly. “I noticed her indomitable spirit in one of the zonal athletics meet and instantly knew this girl would make it big in sports,” says Kannan.


  Her agility and speed impressed Kannan. “It is a great quality for a sprinter. Acceleration and sudden speed bursts are two important aspects of sprinting. It all depends how fast you release your foot from the ground after landing. It happens in micro seconds, we coaches try to improve the timing and that has a telling effect in the final run,” he says.


  Kannan insists on high knee, front kick and galloping techniques to hone the skills of his wards. He also takes them to Alagarkoil during off season for the high-altitude training routines.


  “Traditionally boys and girls from Madurai are athletic. They are tuned to run fast, thanks to rural sports and games like jallikattu, manju virattu and rekla race. Moreover, most of them are not well off and come to sports with a passion to succeed in the bigger arena. That killer instinct helps them train hard and strain every nerve and sinew to come out in flying colours,” says Kannan, himselfa national level athlete trained under international athlete Ramanathan.


  Sprinters like Solaimathi, Pandeeswari, Thirunagadurai, Ramanthan, Charles Borromeo, Gnanasekaran, who have made a mark at national and international meets, prove that Madurai is a good breeding centre for athletics.


  Sensing the propensity for athletics among youngsters in the city, the Sports Development Authority of Tamil Nadu sanctioned Sprint and Jump Academy to Madurai a decade ago.


  “Madurai is blessed with not only potential athletes but also dedicated coaches,” says S. Murugan, District Sports Officer, SDAT (Madurai unit).


  “We select athletes based on their performances right from school level. The selected athletes get to train on synthetic track and in addition get Rs.6000 per year as incentive. There are several schemes for the development of sportspersons. We have already spotted higher-secondary studying quarter-miler Naveen for the Champion Development Scheme based on his achievement. He has run 400m under 47 seconds, which is remarkable for a school student. At present there are 108 athletes in the academy,” he says.


  It is time the current crop of aspiring athletes translate their promises to results and carry forward Madurai’s rich sprinting legacy.

I can’t remember the month, but I was very proud when the student body voted for my cousin, Sylvia Belcher, as the most popular girl at SHS. We had a dance when Sylvia was crowned Miss Sebring High.


  It was an honor to be chosen by the senior class to be a Senior Notable in our annual yearbook. I was chosen along with Lewie Powers as “Best Looking.”


  April was a very busy month. We went on our senior class trip during the Easter break. We left on Wednesday, April 13 and rode all night on the Silver Meteor to Washington D.C. We spent the day there, toured the capitol and had our picture taken in front of the capitol building. It was a great day and we got back to the train to continue our trip to New York. It was my first trip to New York City and I was excited to see the sights. On Easter Sunday we went to St. Patrick’s Cathedral, It was quite an experience to see something so magnificent. Sunday night we were back on the train and on our way home.


  A few days later was our Junior-Senior Banquet and Prom. It was a tradition in our school for the junior class to host the seniors. The theme was ”Oriental Gardens” and the junior class did a great job with the decorations. The dance was at the Woodlawn Elementary School cafeteria. I went alone to the banquet and Errol surprised me just before the dance. He was on duty at the fire station, so I wasn’t expecting him. Chief Thurman Haywood, told him, “go surprise your girl,’ and let him off for a few hours.


  May brought in another trip. The band went to St. Petersburg for state contest. We made superior in concert, sight-reading and marching. The crowd loved the Charleston Dance that the majorettes performed once again. It was also kind of sad for me, because it was my last performance as a majorette. I will always be thankful to Paul Gustat, our band director, for teaching me how to play the clarinet. It was such an honor to be a member of the Sebring High School Band. Another great thing about that trip was that my mother got to go along as a chaperone. Mama had supported me through all of my years in the band, washing and ironing my white skirt, and keeping everything clean. She had never been anywhere with us, because as a single mother, she was always working to support me, so it was a big thrill for her to be on that trip. What a wonderful memory.


  At the end of May, Errol Lanier asked me to marry him. We had dated off and on for three years, so it didn’t surprise anyone when we announced we were getting married. I went to the ball park, because he was playing in a semi-pro baseball game. He came over to the fence and said, ”your ring is in the glove compartment if you want it.” So romantic.


  Sunday, June 5, 1960 was the Baccalaureate service in the high school auditorium.


  On the last day of school we sang our class song with the words that had been written for us to the tune of “Harbor Lights,” then we left the auditorium as seniors and students of Sebring High School for the last time.


  June 10, 1960 was graduation day. I was excited and happy and I was ready to begin the rest of my life. I didn’t know that in the future I would realize how lucky I was to have been born and raised in this wonderful town and to go to a school that would be a part of my life forever. It has been 60 years and our old school building is gone now, it was demolished in 1979, but I will always love that old building with the wooden floors and staircases, it lives in my heart and I will never forget.


  (On June 30, 1960, Errol and I were married at First Baptist Church in the “glass building.” We will be celebrating our 60th anniversary this year.)

For East Ridge, Lake Minneola, Mount Dora, South Lake and Tavares high schools, cars will park drive-in-theater style as students walk across the stage. Lake Virtual is planning a smaller similar ceremony on its campus.


  The Class of 2020 students in Lake County and around the country have seen their senior year upended because of the pandemic. Many traditional celebrations were canceled while students and families stayed close to home and avoided large gatherings. Lake County Schools found creative ways to celebrate with online and drive-through recognitions, but questions were frequently raised about whether an official graduation ceremony would be possible.


  Kornegay put those concerns to rest last month when she wrote an open letter assuring seniors that graduation ceremonies would indeed take place, even if they look a little different than they have in the past.


  “[We] have all agreed that COVID-19 should not steal the lifelong memory of a graduation ceremony,” she wrote in the April 7 letter. “As soon as it is safe to do so, we will make sure that the Class of 2020 receives the recognition and the celebration that you so greatly deserve.”

KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) — The cockpit voice recorder of the Pakistani airliner that crashed last week was found on Thursday, six days after the passenger plane went down in a crowded neighborhood near the airport in the city of Karachi, killing 97 people on board. The recorder, recovered from among the plane debris, was subsequently handed over to Airbus experts. Pakistani aviation authorities said this week they are sharing their initial findings with the visiting 11-member team from the European plane maker. The other part of the black box, a flight data recorder, was recovered within hours of the crash. But the cockpit voice recorder had been missing since the plane crashed into a congested residential area near Jinnah International Airport last Friday. There were only two survivors of the Airbus A320 crash, which was carrying 91 passengers and eight crew members. Abdullah Hafeez Khan, a spokesman for Pakistan International Airlines, said the recovery of the cockpit voice recorder was a significant development as it would play an important role in the investigation of the crash. Pakistan’s Aviation Minister Ghulam Sarwar Khan told reporters on Thursday that a preliminary report on the crash, along with reports on other crashes in recent years, would be presented to Parliament on June 22, following a decision by Prime Minister Imran Khan to release all reports on past plane crashes. Initial reports have said the plane crashed after an apparent engine failure. The so-called black box is made up of two components, the cockpit voice recorder and the flight data recorder. Technical experts would review both recorders to determine what caused the crash, which took place just days after Pakistan resumed domestic flights ahead of a Muslim holiday following the end of...

A Canadian search and recovery team working with the U.S. Navy discovered the remains early Wednesday morning, not far from where they also located a large piece of the helicopter's fuselage, the military said in a written statement.


  "This is encouraging news," said Lt.-Gen. Mike Rouleau, the commander of Canadian Joint Operations Command.


  "We do not leave our fallen behind, and recovering Stalker 22′s crew is of the utmost importance to all of us in the Canadian Armed Forces and the Department of National Defence."


  The CH-148 Cyclone helicopter, known as Stalker 22, crashed in the Ionian Sea April 29, killing four members of the air force and two from the navy. The helicopter was returning to HMCS Fredericton after a training flight and crashed within full view of the ship, which was in the Mediterranean participating in a NATO mission.


  The body of Sub-Lt. Abbigail Cowbrough was recovered immediately after the crash and remains of Capt. Brenden Ian MacDonald were recovered almost two weeks later. Four other service members are still listed as missing and presumed dead, including Capt. Kevin Hagen, Capt. Maxime Miron-Morin, Sub-Lt. Matthew Pyke, and Master Cpl. Matthew Cousins.


  Their families were informed that bodies had been located Wednesday, before the military went public with the news.

The sale of cigarettes will remain banned. An illegal trade in cigarettes is thriving, even though the price of a contraband pack can be the equivalent of $6, nearly three times what it cost before the ban.


  South Africa has long had a problem of criminal gangs illegally selling cigarettes, estimated to be in the millions of dollars.


  Critics of the bans say the government is losing sales tax revenue for cigarettes and alcohol. The country’s revenue service told lawmakers recently that it had lost more than $86 million in tax revenue from the sale of cigarettes and alcohol since the lockdown started in March.


  In Cape Town, the Woodstock Brewery has adapted to the ban by using its large vats to cook meals for the city’s poor.


  The Disoufeng Pub, once a popular Soweto watering hole, has not sold any liquor for nearly eight weeks.


  ”It’s really sad to be feeling the pain,” said owner Tobogo Phiri, who reopened its kitchen two weeks ago to sell takeaway food.


  Some of his high-roller customers have tried to get him to break the regulations by selling them liquor, promising to spend the equivalent of more than $500.


  ”You couldn’t even entertain it,” said Phiri, adding he would not break the law. “So it’s been very, very, very hard. But one had to be disciplined and just decline every sale. So we are feeling the pain.”


  Other South Africans say they favor the restrictions.


  ”Without alcohol, serious crime has gone down,” said Mphumelelo Mdunge, a Soweto resident. “And in the hospitals, there are less people injured from drunken driving and from people beating their wives and arguments. All those disagreements have gone down because there’s less alcohol. So I see it as a good thing.”

A return to the Midlands could be made as, after luring Maguire away from Leicester, Villa midfielder Grealish has become a top target for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer as he seeks to bring extra creativity into Old Trafford.


  Any deal for the talented 24-year-old will not come cheap, given what he has achieved in the Premier League during the 2019-20 campaign and his future potential, but United do have money to spend.

  The former Villans striker told _Football Insider_: “Listen, Harry Maguire went for £85m, a world record fee, so you look at Jack Grealish and you’d have to say Jack Grealish has had a better season than Harry Maguire.


  “He’s been absolutely brilliant, he’s carried Aston Villa, I’m sure if it wasn’t for him, Aston Villa would have been relegated ages ago if it hadn’t been for Jack Grealish carrying the team.

However, there were conditions for this equilibrium to be sustainable which may point to possible explanations for the constitutional crisis that the German judges decided to trigger. One condition was that the two courts would attach greater benefits to long-term cooperation than to an escalated conflict in the short run. One possibility is that the judges sitting on the Court have become more sceptic of the long-term benefits of European integration. Both Gertrude Lübbe-Wolff and Michael Gerhardt, who wrote pro-integration dissents in the OMT case, left the Court in 2014. These departures may have affected the Court’s ideological centre of gravity. Or, maybe, it has less to do with an alteration in the composition of an already Eurosceptic bench and more with growing public disaffection with the EU in Germany. Dwindling enthusiasm for the EU and trepidation that fiscally irresponsible governments in the south are turning the EU into a “transfer union” may have lowered the costs of an escalated war with EU judges. The Court’s rhetoric purports to vindicate the interests of German savers and tax payers. This renders it more difficult for German politicians to evade the consequences of its ruling. At the same time, by leaving a door open for the ECB to demonstrate the proportionality of its quantitative easing programme, the Karlsruhe Court has lowered its immediate impact on the Eurozone and mitigated the prospect of an aggressive political reaction. In any case, the German judges are well aware that public support matters in this battle, as shown by the interviews they’ve given in German newspapers to defend their decision.

Market came good for the third day in a row as the Sensex today leaped 333 points to end at nearly a 3—month high of 27,708 following extensive gains on the back of strong earnings amid positive global cues.


  The NSE Nifty went past the 8,600—mark for the first time since November 1.


  Covering of pending short positions following the expiry of the January derivatives contracts today and positive earnings by some companies aided sentiment. Stock exchanges will remain closed tomorrow for the Republic Day.


  After a positive start, the 30—share Sensex rose further as buying activity gathered momentum and hit a high of 27,736.83 before settling 332.56 points, or 1.21 per cent higher at 27,708.14, a level last seen on November 1 when it had closed at 27,876.61.


  The gauge had rallied 341.08 points in the previous two trading sessions.


  Also, the 50—issue NSE Nifty ended at 8,602.75, up 126.95 points, or 1.50 per cent, after shuttling between 8,612.60 and 8,493.95.


  Gains were led by banking, metal, auto and consumer durables stocks, lifting key indices.


  Mood was upbeat aided by optimism ahead of the Union budget on February 1 amid a firming trend at other Asian and European markets following overnight record close in the US markets on fresh optimism over new US President Donald Trump’s economic policies, traders said.


  The banking index advanced the most by surging 2.33 per cent, followed by consumer durables (2.26 per cent), oil & gas (1.75 per cent), PSU (1.64 per cent), capital goods (1.53 per cent), realty (1.46 per cent), metal (1.39 per cent) and auto 1.39 (per cent).


  HDFC Ltd emerged as the top gainer in the Sensex kitty, climbing 4.31 per cent, followed by Adani Ports (up 3.61 per cent).


  HDFC Bank surged 1.56 per cent after the company today reported 15.04 per cent growth in net profit at Rs 3,865.33 crore for the December quarter.


  Maruti Suzuki too climbed 1 per cent after the company today posted a 47.46 per cent jump in standalone quarterly net profit.


  Other prominent gainers were Hero MotoCorp, Axis Bank, Coal India, L&T, ITC Ltd, M&M, SBI, TCS, Bajaj Auto, ONGC, Tata Motors, ICICI Bank, Dr Reddy’s and Tata Steel.


  On the other hand, Bharti Airtel plunged 1.52 per cent on nervous selling after net profit for October—December took an over 54 per cent hit due to a tariff war.


  Overall, 23 out of the 30—share Sensex pack advanced while others ended in the red.


  The broader markets too showed an uptrend, with BSE mid—cap index rising by 0.90 per cent and small—cap 0.87 per cent.


  Foreign portfolio investors net bought shares worth Rs 93.95 crore yesterday, as per provisional data.


  Globally, Japan’s Nikkei ended up 1.43 per cent and the Shanghai Composite index closed 0.22 per cent higher while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng inched up 0.43 per cent.


  Europe too traded strong, with Frankfurt, Paris and London’s FTSE rising by up to 1.13 per cent in their late morning deals.

The police decided to set up a metal detector and install closed circuit television (CCTV) cameras at the entrance of the historic Bhadrakali temple here on Wednesday.


  Police Commissioner G. Sudheer Babu and other senior officers visited the temple to review the security arrangements. He interacted with the temple management and discussed arrangements to be made to make it a safe and secure place.


  The CCTV cameras would be put up throughout the temple and would be synchronised with the office of the Assistant Commissioner of Police, Warangal, to monitor security round the clock.


  Mr. Babu said the security review committee, comprising senior officers, meets regularly to discuss arrangements at important public places. Though there was no immediate threat to the temple, the committee, as part of its duty, reviews the arrangements from time to time and takes necessary steps.


  As the temple became a prominent spot, and with the increase in footfall, the police decided to install a metal detector at the entrance and CCTV cameras. “VIPs visit the temple very often. The general public too visit in large numbers. Stepping up security is part of our duty,” the Commissioner said.


  Deputy Commissioner of Police Venugopal Rao, Assistant Commissioners of Police Chaitanya Kumar, Muralidhar and B. Janardhan, Inspectors Ravi Kumar and S. Ravi Kumar, Sub-Inspector Ranjith Kumar, and temple superintendent Harinath were also present.

DriveU, an app-based on-demand chauffeur service, on Tuesday launched a ‘Driver Share’ option that allows car owners to get their friends to ride along with them.


  The new venture by the Bengaluru-based startup, in association with United Spirits Limited, will enable car owners to not only share their ride with people whom they know but also cut the cost of hiring the driver.


  The app is available on Android and iOS. Car owners can invite their friends to join them. and the invited co-riders can choose to accept. Once accepted, riders can track the car and location of the driver throughout the journey.


  Ramprasad Shastry, CEO of DriveU, said the initiative would help users share their long commuting time with their friends in their own car. “It will help us also reduce traffic congestion and carbon footprint, and also encourage people to not drive when they are tired or drunk.”


  DriveU has 1,500 chauffeurs on board, and the service is available in six cities: Bengaluru, Chennai, Delhi NCR, Hyderabad, Mumbai and Pune. It plans to expand operations to four more cities over the next year.


  Describing the association with the young technology company as ‘unique’ and “long term”, Subroto Geed, Senior Vice President-Marketing, United Spirits Limited, said the decision to go with DriveU was based on USL’s goal to “engage with the right partners to create a personalised experience”.

Yet there was another important condition for the equilibrium that formed the basis for the effective operation of the EU legal system. This was the belief that the German Court would be willing to press the big red button in case the Court of Justice were to unilaterally deviate from the equilibrium path. As in the Cold War, deterrence credibility guaranteed that peace would prevail. It could be that, at some point, the Court of Justice started to doubt this belief. There were reasons to expect that, when responding to the German Court’s reference in the _OMT_ case in 2015, EU judges would make some concessions, difficult as this was on a high-stake, systemic ECB policy. The fact that they did not may indicate that it is when EU judges started to treat the warning shots as mere bluff. That the German judges wanted to send a strong signal was not only clear from the defiantly Eurosceptic language of the _OMT_ reference. But in _Honeywell_ the German judges had expressly indicated that they would offer the Court of Justice a chance to come clean before following through on a _ultra vires_ challenge. Three years after _OMT_ , the Court of Justice announced its judgment on the German Court’s second request for a preliminary ruling in _Weiss_. Again, the judgment offered little tangible concession to the German judges, confirming the diminished credibility of their threats.

  El famoso 'DJ' francés David Guetta anunció este jueves un segundo concierto 'a distancia' el próximo día 30, para recaudar fondos destinados a diversas organizaciones que luchan contra la COVID-19.


  Si el pasado 18 de abril Guetta retransmitió desde Miami un concierto que permitió recaudar más de 700.000 dólares, en esta ocasión el músico y productor estará 'en un lugar icónico de Nueva York', la ciudad de Estados Unidos más golpeada por la pandemia, indicó la red social Facebook, encargada de retransmitir el evento a todo el mundo.


  Con más de 9 millones de discos vendidos en el mundo y más de 50 millones de seguidores en esa red social, Guetta repasará algunos de sus temas más conocidos durante 90 minutos.


  Bajo el título 'United at home' (Unidos en casa), el concierto utilizará herramientas de recaudación de fondos de Facebook para conseguir donaciones en apoyo a la lucha global contra la COVID-19.


  El dinero recaudado se repartirá, según el deseo de los donantes, entre cuatro organizaciones: Feeding America, la mayor red de bancos de alimentos de EEUU; La Fundación de los Hospitales de París; la campaña de la ONU para combatir esta pandemia; o el Fondo creado por el Ayuntamiento de Nueva York.


  El pasado 18 de abril, el concierto del célebre 'DJ' francés concentró a 12 millones de espectadores y se compartió 180.000 veces, lo que generó más de 1.600.000 reacciones. EFE

YG엔터테인먼트는 블랙핑크가 피처링한 레이디 가가 정규 6집 '크로마티카'(Chromatica)의 수록곡 '사워 캔디'(Sour Candy)가 28일 오후 8시에 발매됐다고 이날 밝혔다. 해당 앨범은 29일 발매되지만, 하루 앞서 '사워 캔디'를 예고 없이 먼저 공개한 것이다.      미국에서 발표되는 팝으로는 이례적으로 가사에 한국어도 포함됐다. 블랙핑크는 영어 가사뿐만 아니라 "뜻밖의 표정 하나에 넌 당황하겠지 / 비싼 척이란 말들로 포장한 건 너야" 등 한국어 가사로 된 부분을 소화했다.      블랙핑크는 "굉장히 좋아하는 아티스트인 레이디 가가와 작업하게 돼 너무나 영광이고 기쁘다"며 "재미있게 작업한 곡인 만큼 전 세계 블링크(블랙핑크 팬)들도 즐겁게 들어주면 좋겠다. 많은 분에게 사랑받는 곡이 되길 바란다"고 YG를 통해 전했다.      레이디 가가는 지난 3월 일본 매체 티브이그루브와 가진 인터뷰에서 "블랙핑크에게 곡 작업을 직접 제안했다"며 "이들과의 협업은 굉장히 흥분되고 멋진 시간이었다"고 말했다.      이어 "블랙핑크는 매우 창의적이고 재능이 많은 그룹"이라며 "이 곡을 통해 블랙핑크의 다섯 번째 멤버가 된 게 자랑스럽다"고 덧붙였다.      '사워 캔디'는 마돈나, 저스틴 비버 등 유명 팝스타와 여러 차례 작업한 세계적인 프로듀서 블러드팝(BLOODPOP®), 번즈(Burns), 레이디 가가 등이 만들었다.      특히 YG 산하 레이블인 더블랙레이블 소속 히트곡 메이커 테디가 공동작업자로 이름을 올린 것이 눈에 띈다.      블랙핑크와 레이디 가가의 협업 소식은 레이디 가가가 지난달 SNS에 새 앨범 트랙리스트를 공개하면서 알려졌다.      당시 YG는 "블랙핑크와 레이디 가가는 평소 서로의 음악을 듣고 팬이 되면서 자연스럽게 이번 작업을 진행하게 됐다"고 밝혔다.      블랙핑크는 앞서 2018년에도 영국 출신 팝스타 두아 리파의 '키스 앤드 메이크업'(KISS AND MAKE UP)을 피처링했다. 이 곡은 빌보드와 함께 세계 양대 팝 차트로 꼽히는 영국 오피셜 싱글 차트 36위까지 오른 바 있다.      블랙핑크는 지난해 4월 내놓은 '킬 디스 러브'(Kill This Love)로 미국 빌보드 메인 싱글 차트인 '핫 100' 41위, 메인 앨범 차트인 '빌보드 200' 24위까지 오르며 K팝 걸그룹 신기록을 쓰기도 했다.      이들은 국내에서 9월 첫 번째 정규앨범을 내고 이에 앞서 다음 달 선공개 싱글을 선보일 예정이다.

PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) — CVS Health is opening 10 new drive-thru coronavirus testing sites at pharmacies in Rhode Island on Friday as part of its commitment to open 1,000 such sites nationwide. The new sites will utilize self-swab tests that won’t require people to get out of their vehicles, according to the Woonsocket-based company. No testing will be done in the stores. Patients, who must first make an appointment online, will be given a test kit and instructions at the drive-thru window. A qualified CVS employee will observe the test to ensure it is done properly. Tests will be sent to a third-party lab for processing, with results available in about three days. The 10 new Rhode Island sites are at pharmacies in Cranston, East Greenwich, East Providence, Johnston, Narragansett, Providence, West Warwick and Westerly. ___ UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS LAWSUIT The American Civil Liberties Union of Rhode Island has sued the state Department of Labor and Training for freezing unemployment insurance benefit payments to hundreds of Rhode Islanders without notice or explanation. The federal class-action suit filed Wednesday argues that failing to provide any sort of explanation for suspending benefits violates the constitutional and due process rights of the recipients. The ACLU is asking a judge to permanently bar the state from halting payments without advance written notice and for the state to resume payments to those affected. The state labor department previously said it was investigating thousands of possible fraudulent claims associated with the coronavirus pandemic, which has left more than 100,000 Rhode Islanders out of work. A spokeswoman in a statement said the department has handled an unprecedented volume of claims related to the pandemic. “Out of an abundance...

Debenhams plans to reopen 90 stores on June 15 with a total of 120 stores returning following rent negotiations, the company has confirmed.
 A spokesman said: “In the context of a retail industry undergoing profound change, the management team is working on the future shape of the group, with a view to seeking an exit from administration as a going concern.
 “With a leaner and more flexible operating model, Debenhams will have the ability to adapt to what are likely to be fundamental shifts in the future trading environment.
 Management plan to reopen with a slimmed down head office, which employs around 3,000 people, as staff leave from merchandising, buying, design and HR departments, according to initial reports by Reuters.
 Debenhams was already struggling before the lockdown, having fallen into administration on April 9 in a protective measure against creditors demanding their money.

The State of Florida approved Osceola County’s plan to reopen its vital vacation rental home industry last week.


  Osceola County staff sent Gov. Ron DeSantis their plan the week prior and State Department of Business and Professional Regulation (DPBR) Secretary Halsey Beshears gave the okay via e-mail shortly before 4 p.m. Wednesday, May 20.


  “We appreciate the quick review of our plan and the state’s realization that the vacation rental home sector is a massive part of our economy,” said Osceola County Chairwoman Viviana Janer. “We know that this action will have a ripple effect in our community as there are so many small businesses that support the vacation rental market – from housekeepers, to lawn and pool maintenance workers, to security staff and caterers, to property managers and companies that handle the numerous details that surround a successful vacation.”


  Osceola County had asked for the move after the rollout of Phase 1 of the Governor’s “Safe. Smart. Step-by-Step Plan for Florida’s Recovery.” The full Phase 1 of the plan began last week, and the executive order (20-123) allowed vacation rental homes to open with a county’s plan submitted to and approved by DPBR.


  In Osceola County alone, there are 30,000 licensed vacation home rentals that represent half of the county’s $60 million tourism development tax dollars, with many operated by management companies seeking to avoid permanent closure.


  Osceola County staff previously estimated that vacation home rentals have a $2 billion impact on Osceola County’s economy.


  Highlights of Osceola County's plan for vacation rentals can be found at osceola.org.

But the green light hasn’t necessarily translated into patients returning.


  South Florida pediatrician Audrey Ofir is the director of the pediatric outpatient clinic at Holtz Center Children’s Hospital and an associate pediatrics professor at the University of Miami. She said that in the last two weeks, as the economy has reopened, an average of 50 percent of families are keeping their children’s appointments at the clinic.


  “There’s been an improvement in the show-rate,” said Ofir, who chairs the vaccination committee for the Florida Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics. “But it is not constant, is not stable and is still fluctuating. And I think that the fear factor is still here.”


  To increase immunization rates, Ofir pointed to a need for a “massive vaccination campaign” that includes public education efforts on the benefits and safety of vaccinations. Doctors also could offer extended hours for vaccinations, and mobile vans could be dispatched at an even greater number of school sites, she said.


  The efforts she said, would need the support from the Florida Department of Health, the state agency charged with ensuring public health.


  “We cannot let our fight against one disease come at the expense of all our other long-term work in preventing other equally dangerous and other fatal diseases to be forgotten,” she said.

But Gaspart, who was Barca president from 2000 to 2003, said it would have been different if Madrid were leading the league when it was suspended in March due to the coronavirus pandemic.


  "If Madrid had finished as leader before the confinement, La Liga would have ended," he told _Tertulia del 10 del Barca_ , via AS, on Wednesday.


  Barcelona star Lionel Messi is preparing for life in La Liga following the coronavirus pandemic and admits it will be strange to play again.


  "I don't think anyone could have seen something like this coming. Some people warned that worldwide pandemics could happen from time to time, but I really never could have imagined it would unfold like it did, or the enormous impact it's having on virtually the entire world," Messi told _adidas_.


  "Living or working with so much uncertainty is never easy, especially when faced with a situation as unheard-of as this one. We all wonder when we'll get back to work, when we'll start training and competing again. For any soccer player, it's crucial to stay focused when you hit the field.


  "When we start playing again, it will be like starting from scratch. We'll have some time to get ready before the league starts up, and we'll also get back key players on our team who were injured. Technically it will still be the same season, but I think every team and player will feel it's different."


  While Barcelona will aim to clinch the La Liga title, they continue to be linked with former star Neymar, who could return to the club from Paris Saint- Germain.

This has given them green light to deprive teachers of their National Security Social Fund (NSSF) and Pay As You Earn (PAYE). Arguably, by and large, among the key sectors that defraud government of NSSF and PAYE, is the education sector. To make matters worse, many private schools deduct this money (NSSF and PAYE), from the staff salary, but never remit it, to the relevant authorities. I implore the Education Ministry, to bring this exploitation to an end, lest we are ready to see many teachers suffer in their old age. While government is tirelessly working on salary enhancement for the public service, including teachers, the reverse is happening in private schools.

Realizing the impossibility of determining my proper number or letter, I turned to the helpful sizing charts provided. From U.S. to U.K. and E.U., my proper size varied vastly across retailers. My shape ranged from a size zero — trust me I know that’s not right — to a shocking 4X at one online boutique. I’ve been snacking a bit more lately, but that cannot be correct.


  How my measurements equaled size 0, large, X-large or even a 4X depending on where I was scrolling, frustrated me. Women come in all shapes and sizes, but this is beyond ridiculous. Clearly some retailers sized me down — a nod to vanity perhaps — while others based their clothing on a demographic I did not fit into no matter what number was on it. Finally, I found one that offered an option to enter your measurements and they matched you with the best size for the clothing item you were purchasing. I was instantly intrigued.


  Utilizing the return information from customers, a handful of online retailers have become fit savvy. I was impressed when I received the notification that based on my inputted measurements, some 85% of their customers suggested sizing up for better fit. On another item, it prompted me that I may wish to size down based on similar return data. I found this way more helpful than reading a handful of reviews.


  Online everything seems to be the way this world is heading and if I can eliminate the hassle of trying on clothing in public, I’m all for it. Time will tell if this new fit process hits the mark. If not, the return’s on them. That’s some customer care I can truly appreciate, no matter what size they label me.

On New Year's Eve, reports emerged that China was investigating a severe upper-respiratory illness plaguing Wuhan. Four days later, the Chinese Communist Party secretly ordered the destruction of novel coronavirus samples gathered by Chinese labs and quickly commissioned the World Health Organization to help them cover it up.


   


  Meanwhile, Chinese citizens continued to travel the world, unknowingly spreading the virus through every major city in Europe and the United States.


   


  The intelligence we received in Congress very quickly disputed the fraudulent narrative the WHO and China had spun to the rest of the world. On Jan. 28, I was the first member of Congress to take to the floor and sound the alarm on the potential for a pandemic. I knew then that the conflicting information the United States was receiving indicated a Chinese cover-up.


   


  Five days later, President Trump temporarily banned travel to-and-from China -- a move will go down in history as the most critical precautionary measure of the entire pandemic. Nevertheless, national Democrats and their news media allies -- never slow to denounce every move President Trump makes -- said the ban was a racially motivated move against Chinese people.


   


  Nancy Pelosi held a press conference in San Francisco's Chinatown to encourage people to get out and congregate there, and WHO called the ban "excessive" and "mean." Joe Biden and the New York Times said the ban was "unjust" and "xenophobic." Despite the early left wing rhetoric, bipartisan experts now agree that the Chinese travel ban bought our country time and likely saved countless lives by blunting the virus directly at its source.


   


  In contrast to our early and dire warnings, Chuck Schumer's handpicked Democrat nominee for Senate in Kansas, Barbara Bollier, tweeted on March 20 -- well after the virus had reached even Kansas -- that Americans should "trust" the Chinese-funded WHO to manage health emergencies first, even before the United States.


   


  She said that "as a doctor," she trusts the "experts." Instead, it should have read that as an ideologue, she trusted the fraudulent body propped up by the media to counter President Trump.


   


  We need a physician in the Senate who knows that China, hand in glove with the corrupt WHO, defrauded the world. We need a physician in the Senate who still believes in Kansas values and who knows right from wrong. We need a physician in the Senate who isn't afraid to dump the so-called "experts" when their point of view is bought and paid for by the Chinese Communist Party.


   


  I trust that over the next several months and into the fall, Kansans will see the contrast between myself and Democrat Barbara Bollier. The contrast between doing what is convenient, and doing what is hard.


   


  We need a senator who is not afraid of what the liberal cable news will criticize but rather do what will keep Kansas safe. We need a senator who will stand up to China, and not be complicit in their global propaganda machine.

As I was singing, Vidhu [Vinod Chopra] was in the washroom. He came out and he asked, what are you doing. I said, I am just singing random words. He said, let’s do a song.

While dozens of Polk County schools have been sitting empty due to the pandemic, school officials haven't been sitting by idly. Polk County Public Schools officials have been busy laying the groundwork for the $70 million construction of two new elementary schools, one in Davenport and the other in Mulberry.


  “We are excited to break ground this summer on two new state-of-the-art elementary schools,” said Angela Usher, the PCPS Assistant Superintendent for Facilities and Operations.


  The Mulberry school, to be constructed on a 21-acre Bailey Road campus, has been in the works for years, adds schools spokesman Jason Geary, and the new Davenport school — to be built in the Bella Citta area — was added to the district's to-do list in 2017. The Davenport school will sit on a 38-acre site.


  “The (Davenport) school was added to the district's capital improvement plan in 2017 because of the significant growth occurring in the northeast part of the county,” Usher said. “The new campuses will help alleviate the need to transport children to schools farther away or put students in existing schools where capacity is close to its maximum.”

While the full details of the positive tests are not disclosed, Fulham have announced that two of the three are members of their playing squad.


  Both Fulham players, who will remain unnamed unless they choose otherwise, have returned to self-isolation in line with league and government guidelines.


  Blackburn Rovers have also confirmed that their captain, Elliott Bennett, tested positive for Covid-19 during the latest round of testing.


  A statement read: "Having initially submitted a negative test last Friday (May 22), Bennett took a second test on Monday (May 25), which has now provided a positive result.


  "The 31-year-old, who is asymptomatic and feeling no ill effects, will now self-isolate at home for the next seven days and provided he develops no symptoms, he will, in line with medical protocols, return to training with his Rovers team-mates on Friday June 5."


  In the first round of testing, carried out last week, two individuals at one club – later revealed to be Hull City – tested positive for the coronavirus.


  Tests are carried out on both players and coaching staff. While the ideal scenario would obviously be for no tests to be returned positive, such a low figure is likely to be taken as a positive.


  As the Premier League appears increasingly likely to return in the coming weeks, the future of the EFL season remains up in the air.


  In the Championship, most clubs are believed to want to finish the campaign, though Hull are reportedly firmly against resuming – a position which was taken before testing began.


  League One clubs are split over how and whether the season should be ended, with vital discussions on the subject to take place in the coming days.

The grand reopening at Avanti's went better than John Gigliotti expected.


   


  The popular West Eighth Street breakfast spot brought in about 50 percent of its usual business when it opened for takeout customers on May 14. Gigliotti, the general manager, thought he'd only see about a third of the sales Avanti's typically does from sit-in dining.


   


  "I totally underestimated today," Gigliotti said on opening day. "We did $500 in sales."


   


  Avanti's closed on March 17, the same day Gov. Tom Wolf ordered restaurants and bars across Pennsylvania to close their dine-in facilities to slow the spread of COVID-19.


   


  Gigliotti was pleased with the turnout for Avanti's reopening, but he's not sure whether it will last.


   


  "Will that continue every day? We're going to find out," he said. "We've been gone for a long time and I know a lot of people have been missing it."


   


  The fact that 50 percent of regular sales is considered a good day shows just how much "normal" has changed in Erie's restaurant industry since the COVID-19 crisis took hold.


   


  John Melody, an owner of the U Pick 6 family of restaurants, said the transition from the red phase, under which the strictest pandemic protections were in place, into the yellow phase made little difference for eateries. Restrictions on dine-in facilities are still in force during the yellow phase.


   


  "What would be wonderful is if we could get a little bit of guidance on when the green phase might be coming, and what, if anything, we might be able to do," Melody said in mid-May.


   


  "Takeout is great, but businesses can't survive off that," he said. "Businesses can't even break even off that."


   


  In the meantime, restaurants like Melody's are trying creative new options to keep customers coming in. U Pick 6 has introduced online ordering to make meal takeout and curbside pickup as seamless as possible.


   


  "That's been fantastic, and the response to that as a user from the patrons has been good," Melody said.


   


  At Madeline's Dining & Events, in Elk Creek Township, owner Justin Herring has also added online ordering and delivery options in addition to takeout.


   


  "The first couple days, it was really, really scary because we did like $60" in sales, Herring said.


   


  But business has improved, he said. He added new features, like a Thursday wing night, to draw in customers. And he's selling homemade face masks and "ear savers," designed to reduce the pressure on people's ears from wearing masks for long periods.


   


  Herring said Madeline's is doing about 40 percent of the business he'd normally see if dine-in eating was an option -- better than expected, considering.


   


  "A lot depends on what happens during this second wave of reopening," he said. "If there's a second wave of an outbreak, we're really worried that this thing goes on for longer."

“They’ve banned the sale of cigarettes but we’re still able to buy them,” said street vendor Mluleki Mbhele. “We buy cigarettes in the streets in the black market. The officials know about it because they themselves continue to smoke.”


  Critics describe the prohibitions imposed by President Cyril Ramaphosa as puritanical, hypocritical and unrealistic. Around the world, only Panama and Sri Lanka are reported to be prohibiting the sale of liquor during the pandemic, while India and Thailand temporarily banned it.


  South African government officials say the number of admissions to hospital emergency rooms from alcohol-related crimes and vehicle accidents have been reduced significantly. Supporters of the ban on cigarette sales say smoking weakens the respiratory system, which is attacked by the virus.


  South Africa has the continent’s highest number of confirmed coronavirus cases with over 24,000. The virus has spread relatively slowly across Africa, whose 54 countries with a population of 1.3 billion have reported a total of over 115,000 cases.


  More than 230,000 South Africans have been arrested for breaking the lockdown regulations, including the bans on alcohol and tobacco sales, said national police minister Bheki Cele.


  “We have also observed an increase in smuggling of contraband (liquor and tobacco) between South Africa’s land borders with Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Mozambique and Zimbabwe, as well as the sale of these products in the black market,” Cele said on May 22, adding that officials seized alcohol and cigarettes worth Rand 2.67 million (about $148,000) in March and April.


  At first, South African vineyards were prohibited from transporting or exporting their wine, causing a loss in international sales. That restriction was lifted May 1 but the winemakers are still being hurt on lost domestic sales.


  That will improve June 1, when South Africa further eases its lockdown by allowing the sale of alcohol for home consumption on limited days per week. Pubs and bars will remain closed, prompting criticism that they also should be allowed to sell for home consumption.

  "We have guidance from the Pennsylvania Association of Realtors that includes using the gloves, shoe covers and masks," said Mark Kibbe, president of the Greater Erie Board of Realtors and a real estate agent with Keller WIlliams Realty.


   


  Kibbe said sellers and potential buyers touring homes must first sign general agreements that concern property access, safety and health.


   


  State guidance also suggests that only two people should be in the house at any one time and must practice social distancing. Some brokers, Kibbe said, interpret the guidance to mean two buyers along with a real estate agent.


   


  "People are living with it and at least we can show houses, but we did have a few sellers who took homes off the market," Kibbe said.


   


  Some buyers also backed out of the market because of layoffs and concern about job security.


   


  But tours are happening and homes are selling quickly, Kibbe said. "We're seeing them list and sell in a day, and we're seeing multiple offers. We're still short on listings."


   


  Kibbe and Groner said showings require cleanup after buyers leave and each showing takes longer.


   


  "We have to be respectful of the sellers, too," Kibbe said.


   


  He said some homeowners might want their residences cleaned after prospective buyers leave, but that other homeowners might be allergic to a disinfectant that a real estate agent uses.


   


  P.J. Monella, association executive of the Greater Erie Board of Realtors, said listings are increasing. "Since reopening Erie County on May 8, we have 98 new listings in seven days and 56 listings have sold and almost 80 went pending," he said.


   


  On May 15, Erie County had 590 active listings including those designated active, pending sales and those with contingency agreements. "We're seeing 15 to 20 new listings a day," Monella said.


   


  Nancy Placidi, a Realtor with Howard Hanna Real Estate, agreed the market had reopened with interest in all price ranges. "For me, it's a lot of past customers, and they have cash or are already pre-approved. I have nine buyers seriously looking, but we need more inventory," she said.


   


  Placidi said one east Erie ranch had 18 showings and 12 offers within a day of hitting the market.


   


  It's not unusual, Placidi said. On multiple listings, buyers are bidding over asking price and still not getting a deal because they are too late. "I've never seen anything like it. If you see something (you want), you can't wait," she said.


   


  New construction


   


  The new construction market is reopening as well, Natalie Washburn, of Maleno Real Estate, said. "We start a new a home every two weeks, so the good news is our schedule is already pretty full. Thankfully, we started the year out well."


   


  She added that low interest rates are also an incentive for buyers to look at new construction.


   


  Clients who want to visit spec homes and design centers require the same personal protective equipment as in any other home for sale.

This is awesome either way. FINALLY we can get rid of x86 once and for all and move to ARM entirely, something we should be doing already in my opinion.

MYRTLE BEACH, S.C. (WMBF) - Dental hygiene students are worrying about their future after facing licensing delays due to the COVID-19 pandemic.As states continue to reopen across the country, dental offices have been extra busy with patients. But the COVID-19 pandemic hasn’t only impacted non-emergency visits, it’s also affecting those hoping to get into the dentistry field.Lindsay Sherrill, a second-year dental hygiene student at Horry-Georgetown Technical College, was supposed to graduate with her license to practice this month.But because of the pandemic, that’s all changed, and starting her dream career is now on hold.Sherrill said she took the written board on Wednesday after it was rescheduled multiple times, but she still has her clinical board, which is needed in order for her to get her license.“There’s 20 of us in our class and we were going to graduate the second part of May and several of us had plans to move out-of-state or to start a job somewhere else locally and unfortunately, because we can’t get our license to practice, we can’t be official registered dental hygienist," Sherrill said.Sherill explained what her director said about the plan they have for her class to continue working on completing the class portion.“So we will just be going over instrumentation, we’ll be comped on our skills and then after that, once she has gotten those simulated mannequins in, she said she’s ordered some of those for us to kind of practice and get those clinical hours made up," Sherill said.Sherill also added many of her classmates, including herself, have loans and other kinds of expenses they want to pay off. But because of the hold on licenses, payments like that are also being put on hold.Right now, she said her first day back in clinic is on June 5, but when it comes to the clinical board that date is up in the air.For dental offices re-accepting non-emergency visits, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has shared some recommendations.Some of the recommendations include telephone screens with patients before visits to screen them for any COVID-19 symptoms. Another recommendation is for staff, like practicing sound hand hygiene and putting on a mask before entering a patient or care room.Copyright 2020 WMBF. All rights reserved.
