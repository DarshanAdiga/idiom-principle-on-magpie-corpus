Second, to make sure folks keep earning higher wages down the road, we have to do more to help Americans upgrade their skills.

Helping hardworking families make ends meet. Giving them the tools they need for good-paying jobs in this new economy. Maintaining the conditions for growth and competitiveness. This is where America needs to go. I believe it's where the American people want to go. It will make our economy stronger a year from now, fifteen years from now, and deep into the century ahead.

“This is harassment pure and simple,” she said on Twitter late Thursday. “This ‘inquiry’ by NYC democrats is 100% motivated by politics, publicity and rage. They know very well that there’s nothing here and that there was no tax benefit whatsoever. These politicians are simply ruthless.”

Here's another example. Today, we're the only advanced country on Earth that doesn't guarantee paid sick leave or paid maternity leave to our workers. Forty-three million workers have no paid sick leave. Forty-three million. Think about that. And that forces too many parents to make the gut-wrenching choice between a paycheck and a sick kid at home. So I'll be taking new action to help states adopt paid leave laws of their own. And since paid sick leave won where it was on the ballot last November, let's put it to a vote right here in Washington. Send me a bill that gives every worker in America the opportunity to earn seven days of paid sick leave. It's the right thing to do.

Of course, nothing helps families make ends meet like higher wages. That's why this Congress still needs to pass a law that makes sure a woman is paid the same as a man for doing the same work. Really. It's 2015. It's time. We still need to make sure employees get the overtime they've earned. And to everyone in this Congress who still refuses to raise the minimum wage, I say this: If you truly believe you could work full-time and support a family on less than $15,000 a year, go try it. If not, vote to give millions of the hardest- working people in America a raise.

"I wanted him to be proud of me… we come to that scene and I was like, 'I want to deliver this scene so bad'… I flubbed my line on the take and I messed it up in front of the audience and my mind snapped and I'm like, 'Ahhhh. Ahhh!'

I’d been thinking about it, but had never had the time to focus on it. So when my friend Nikhil Kamath asked me to do up his new residence, it gave me the chance to create something new. While I drew inspiration from various aesthetic schools, from Art Deco to Post Modern, it is all connected with one common thread, which is India. It also gave us an opportunity to give relief to local businesses. Everything we used in the space was sourced locally.
 This sense of community is very important, especially now. There are so many people in the country with such beautiful visions and products, so why not appreciate their good work? If you are narcissistic, you will never learn. Pre-Covid, we hosted various designers like Cell Design and péro at our store. Post-Covid, we reached out to those who may just be starting out building their e-stores to come share ours. We have Ashdeen Lilaowala on board and are in talks with Torani.
 It’s too early to make plans for any retail expansion. Online will be the focus. And when the vaccine is out, we will be out too.
