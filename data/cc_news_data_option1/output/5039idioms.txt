Aus dem Weihnachtsgeschäft hat sich Dolly Parton (74) lange ziemlich herausgehalten, jetzt aber gibt es für ihre Fans gleich doppelt Grund zur Freude. Parallel zum Album ist auf Netflix das Weihnachtsmusical «Christmas On The Square» erschienen, für das die Country-Queen 14 Originalsongs geschrieben hat. Fünf Parton-Lieder gibt es auch auf «A Holly Dolly Christmas» zu hören - und natürlich eine ganze Reihe vertrauter Klassiker («All I Want For Christmas Is You») im luftigen Country-Gewand. Neben Gaststars wie Schönsänger Michael Bublé oder Country-Ikone Willie Nelson sind Bruder Randy Parton, Patentochter Miley Cyrus und deren Vater Billy Ray Cyrus an Bord. Die Stimmung ist feierlich, ein wenig kitschig - so soll Weihnachten ja auch sein.

On the road, against a legitimate Super Bowl contender, the Browns, who came in with just one win over a team above .500, executed coach Kevin Stefanski's game plan to perfection in the first half. They stamped themselves as legitimate threats in the AFC.
 “Everybody’s eyebrows in a sense have been raised about our team,” wide receiver Jarvis Landry said afterward.
 And maybe about Mayfield as well.
 Plagued by inconsistency in his third season, Mayfield didn't make a mistake while shredding Tennessee's defense for 290 yards in the first half. He finished 25 of 33 for 334 yards and has gone nearly six games — 156 straight passes — without an interception.
 Over that span, Mayfield, who has been prone to turnovers, has 11 TD passes, zero picks and the Browns have gone 5-1.
 This is the accurate, aggressive, confident Mayfield that Cleveland thought it had during his strong rookie season, only to have it followed by a subpar second one that created doubts whether he was a franchise quarterback. That talk has quieted in Year 3 as the Browns close in on their first postseason berth in 18 years.
 Mayfield credits his turnaround of late to being on the same page with Stefanski and their level of trust in each other. During Cleveland's bye week, they dissected Mayfield's game — good and bad — and came up with play concepts that suited the QB's strengths.

The desolation had a profound psychological effect. The Pilgrims would have believed themselves favored by Providence. The Indians, seeing their neighbors drop like flies and the colonists escape unharmed, would have assumed the God the settlers proclaimed was a mighty one. But psychology was not the whole of it.

 # Brookfield Bulldogs cagers fall short in try for third in tourney
 As reported to LCL
 QUEEN CITY — After opening the Tri-Rivers Classic tournament with a victory early last week, the Brookfield High School Bulldogs dropped their semifinals and finals contests to miss out on a trophy.
 Last Thursday, facing the top-seeded Clark County Indians, the Bulldogs stayed close, but eventually fell, 44-32.
 Then, on Saturday, BHS’ boys lost the third-place game to Milan, 53-45, to drop to 1-2 for the season.
 The Brookfield Lady Bulldogs did gain their first 2020-21 triumph in the seventh-place game Friday at Queen City.
 Facing a depleted Clark County squad which, as the top seed in its gender division, had needed to forfeit its first two games in the tournament, presumably for COVID-19 reasons.
 The Lady Indians scraped together enough players to meet Brookfield Friday, but the Lady Bulldogs netted 26-21 victory. Like their male counterparts, the BHS girls stood 1-2 entering this week’s play.
 The next BHS hoops action isn’t scheduled to be until next Monday, Dec. 14, when Hamilton is to visit for girls’ and boys’ play.
 No information was reported by the Brookfield wrestlers' participation in last Saturday's tournament of dual matches at Hallsville.

The Englishmen who explored Massachusetts Bay did nothing to make themselves especially welcome. In the decade before the Pilgrims arrived, there had been various incidents in which natives, dozens in total, had been invited on board French, English, Dutch, or Spanish ships and kidnapped, either to be trained as guides or sold as slaves. One of these was Squanto, captured near Plymouth in 1614, who escaped from the Spanish slave port of Málaga to London and made his way back to his native Plymouth.

Bohužel jsme gól dostali, ale po jednom z mála našich útoků ve druhém poločase, kdy pěknou střelu Petera Štepanovského brankář Kolář vyrazil, jsme pak z jediného rohu vyrovnali. Vyplnil se náš taktický záměr,“ říká Floder.

Since then, Mayfield has been solid, not flawless. But he's significantly better, and so are the Browns.
 “Obviously, he is taking care of the ball,” Stefanski said. "He was extremely productive yesterday, found completions to all sorts of guys and had a completion himself. He is doing a nice job, and he is comfortable in what we are doing.”
 WHAT'S WORKING
 Stefanski has pushed all the right buttons and he threw a literal curveball at the Titans by putting the game on Mayfield's shoulders.
 With the expectation of a ground battle between two of the NFL's better running teams, the Browns went to the air. Mayfield tied Hall of Famer Otto Graham's team record with four TDs in a half. Coincidentally, he did it on what would have been the legendary QB's 99th birthday.
 Stefanski's play calling has been exceptional, and he dug into his bag of tricks as well, pulling off a tackle-eligible play to backup lineman Kendall Lamm for a TD and having Landry complete a pass to Mayfield.
 WHAT NEEDS HELP
 Finishing. For the second time this season, the Browns nearly let a humongous lead slip away. Up more than four touchdowns, they relaxed and the Titans, helped by a late fumble by Mayfield, outscored Cleveland 28-3 after halftime.
