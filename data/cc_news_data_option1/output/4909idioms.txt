The CPI inflation figure used to make these assessments will also be used for new National Insurance limits and thresholds, and the rates of Class 2 & 3 National Insurance contributions in 2021/22, Your Money reports.
 The Low Incomes Tax Reforms Group (LITRG) told that website that national insurance contributions, the class 1 primary threshold at which people start paying contributions, could increase from £183 a week to £184.
 Again, this sounds like good news on paper, but inflation has to be remembered.
 The LITRG calculates that those earning £25,000 a year could end up paying £14 less in income tax and £5.64 less on class 1 national insurance contributions.

Wilshere is among those to have suggested that the proven 32-year-old should be playing a prominent role for Arsenal and that there is more to his absence than meets the eye.
 The England international expects his instincts to be proved correct at some stage, with Ozil set to lift the lid when he becomes a free agent in the summer of 2021.
 “I think he'd be a big player in that team,” Wilshere told _Sky Sports._ “I would love to see Ozil play in that team under Arteta but obviously that's not happening at the moment. He could get on the ball and feed the likes of [Pierre-Emerick] Aubameyang and [Alexandre] Lacazette.
 “I loved playing with him. He was a top player. It's a shame, but what is happening is happening, and no one knows but I'm sure everyone will find out one day.”
 While Ozil finds himself stuck in the shadows at Arsenal, former team-mate Wilshere is without a club altogether following his release by West Ham.
 Interest has been shown in the 28-year-old, but no deal has been done as yet and a man who has endured his fair share of injury struggles down the years is keeping doors open to MLS and the CSL.
 “I'm in a position now where I can make a decision based on footballing reasons and pick the team that I think I could fit into,” Wilshere said.

 Leahy appeared third choice for the spot on the left side of defence just a few weeks ago while Ben Garner was in charge, behind David Tutonda and Ali Koiki, but the 28-year-old has started the past two games and is the man in possession of the shirt.

It doesn't support Wi-Fi 6, but the Nest Wifi mesh router still punches well above its weight with stable, reliable performance and enough advanced features to feel like an upgrade. The system's main router is the slightly bigger device on the left in the image above, and it'll work on its own without any of the range-extending Nest Wifi Point smart speakers. It usually costs $169, but this week, Google is offering it up for $139.
 That's not a bad deal, but if you're starting from scratch, you're better off just getting the two-pack with the router and one extender at the normal $269 combo price (those extenders cost $150 on their own). However, if you use the first-gen Google Wifi mesh system in your home, you can swap in the Nest Wifi router and use it with your first-gen Google Wifi extenders for faster speeds and better performance.

 "No one can have any doubt that Messi loves Barcelona, ​​in our relationship we respect and love each other," the 58-year-old told a press conference.
 "I have not spoken with him because I think it would not be convenient to speak without having the power to decide, the elections have to pass, I hope to have the confidence of the members to be president and then I'm sure we'll talk but we haven't done it yet.
 "Leo loves Barcelona."
 Laporta added on the need to ensure that Messi remains comfortable in his current surroundings amid talk of a possible switch to England or France: "He lives in a place where his whole family is comfortable and there is not much to encourage leaving a city like this, it is a kind of life that is very good for them.
 "[Change it for Paris or Manchester?] well, it is not a question of money but we have to rise to the occasion and we must give them an almost familiar treatment, esteem and professional appreciation.
 "I think there will be time to talk, although the calendar and the dynamics are what they are, if they had been before the elections, agreements could have been reached earlier."

ARGUINEGUIN, Spain (AP) — Spain has dismantled most of the temporary camp for migrant processing that became known as the “dock of shame” for holding thousands of Africans in squalor after they arrived in the Canary Islands. The last to leave were 27 migrants who tested positive for coronavirus and have been placed in isolation. The facility has been criticized by human rights organizations and Spain’s ombudsman for its poor conditions. The migrants were moved into military facilities and hotels across the Canary Islands. More than 20,000 people seeking a better life have arrived so far this year in the Spanish archipelago in the Atlantic Ocean, up from 1,500 in the same period of 2019.

Then comes this week’s planning commission hearing that will cover a 58-unit development tucked between the Ludington Boat Club and Carrom. MVAH Development is proposing a mix of 1-, 2- and 3-bedroom units in a structure that is four stories tall.
 All four of these developments are still in the works. Things can happen where a development very well could fall through. There was one development that was promising just two years ago, but the assistance from the state didn’t line up. Herman & Kittle Properties tried to bring low-income housing near the old train depot off of Madison Street inside the Fourth Ward dubbed the Depot Apartments.
 The proposed Depot Apartments were exactly what our community needed. And really, all of these housing developments are what our community needs.
 There very well could be some developments in the works where jobs are coming. We’ve not seen them — yet. Plus, the COVID-19 pandemic, is making some companies and businesses do things they didn’t think to do before. Instead of factories, much of what we can do has gravitated online.
 If the speed and reliability of internet access improves for our area, we very well could see these new housing units or those who move into our area take advantage. This whole working remotely deal very well could take root right here.
 Whether or not employment opportunities are on their way is one thing. If these housing developments come to fruition, we’ll know soon enough what the answer is to that age-old question, what comes first, housing or employment?
