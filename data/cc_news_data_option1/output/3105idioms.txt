 It's a special time of year, the weird season. It isn't an annual event but comes around regularly. I am not a politician, the best thing about me is that I say what I mean and the worst thing about is that I say what I mean. Some people appreciate that, some don't. While I am not a politician, I do understand the role of government, the need for good people to fill the positions in that government and task of selecting and placing the right people in those positions.
 It is this weird season that makes this so strange. For some reason we are expected to vet these candidates based on the practice of self-validation, self-promotion, and numerous other self-perpetuated actions.
 I always preferred a third-party validation, a validation offered by someone who had nothing to gain by recognizing my ability or attributes. That validation means something to me. But this is the weird season, a time where people want us to hire them to fill a position for the next few years and their interviewing technique is to make claims and assertions about themselves that all seem to be self-promoting but empty.
 Maybe this is the result of radio and television ads. People trying to cram information into one minute or less depending on what their budget allows. Until the November election I don't even want to turn the television on due this problem. You can't get to know someone in a minute. There is a time investment that must be made in order to really know someone. With that being said, these candidates still rely on reaching the masses with messages that may or may not reflect what you will be receiving.
 There are other ways to communicate with people and with the general public. Most of those require a huge time investment and a real dedication, but isn't that what we want in people who are going to fill those positions in our government?
 I guess the ones that really send the wind whistling up my skirt, are those that have apparent legal, moral, or personal problems but refuse to address them. To add insult to injury, some even develop a dialog to deny the issues. It has been my experience that whether they win or lose, these issues develop into full grown monsters later on. What did they think it was going to do, just go away?
 My practice has been to avoid this type of emotional release in my writings. This year has seemed to have taken a toll. Part of the problem is that a lot of the information and candidates are located in areas that I am not affected by thus giving me cause to form an opinion of the area as well as the candidates. How can people that live there put up with this kind of nonsense?
 Well, good luck with all of this. I recall a contractor that I was having difficulty with during my thirty-one years with the State Highway Department, he said, \"What did you expect, you guys took the lowest bid?\"

Bloomberg) -- Carvana Co. shares fell in late trading after the company reported a rebound in sales and smaller-than-expected quarterly loss but warned that inventory constrants could put a damper on growth.
 The used-car retailer sold 55,098 vehicles in the second quarter, up 25% from a year earlier. Total gross profit per unit came in slightly higher than expectations at $2,726, and revenue rose to $1.12 billion.
 But the Phoenix-based company’s shares plunged as much as 12% after the close of regular trading after flagging that it has less than 6,000 vehicles available for purchase, the lowest since the third quarter of 2018.
 “We believe our current inventory is meaningfully limiting sales, making growing inventory our top company priority,” Chief Executive Officer Ernie Garcia and Chief Financial Officer Mark Jenkins wrote in a letter to shareholders.
 While revenue growth slowed and trailed estimates, Carvana painted a robust demand picture in its earnings release, saying that the second quarter “started at the peak of Covid-19 related economic disruption and ended with structural shifts in customer preferences leading to the strongest demand we have ever seen.”
 Carvana’s whole business model is based on selling vehicles online and delivering those cars to customers’ doorsteps. While the company felt some early pain as the impacts of the pandemic took hold, the retailer’s offering is attracting consumers who are stuck at home, avoiding public transportation and shopping online.
 The company expanded into 100 new markets in the second quarter and says it now serves 73.2% of the population, up from 68.7% three months earlier.

Bundoran manager Terry McCann was impressed by St Eunan's on Friday night last but was not overly despondent about his own team. However, he feels the championship will start in earnest for Bundoran this Saturday in Termon.   "They (St Eunan's) are a very strong team. Performance wise, apart from a 10 minute period when they got away from us in the first half, I was happy with our boys.   "They were ruthless opposition. And if you don't take your chances, you are under pressure," said McCann.   "The gap at half-time was nine points and there was a fear they would get away from us. Ashley (Mulhern) made some brilliant saves and we would have been well out of it but for him.   "I could not fault the effort. We had four or five back in the team from the games in Ballyshannon and against MacCumhaills.   "For us the championship really starts next week in Termon. It is a must win game for both teams. It will be real cut and thrust championship fare," said McCann, who was happy with the standards achieved on Friday night despite the conditions.   "It was difficult to control the ball but St. Eunan's coped very well. We were still fighting at the end and I can't ask for more than that. We need to brush up on our finishing."   Towards the end of the game Bundoran put big midfielder Ciaran McCaughey into the full-forward position and it worked to some degree. "We were slow to support him. It wouldn't be much you would see in club football in Donegal as they try to run the ball through the hands. It worked a wee bit for us but in some cases it was robbing Peter to pay Paul.   "Overall I'm happy with the effort but not happy with the results," said McCann, who added that next weekend was the game "and there could be worse coming down the road after that".   As for St Eunan's, he said: "They are a top class outfit. They will take a bit of beating in this championship."

But beginning in season three, we know the _real_ colors.

But then a strange thing happens in just two episodes that season, which were actually filmed earlier: The fireplace wall changes to something we haven’t seen before and won’t see again. It’s a red brick fireplace, not white, with building niches on the left-hand side and a brown wood bookcase on the right. No magic involved, but by episode 15 of season three, it’s back the way we remember it best. That’s a lot of shenanigans for just one season.”

Based on the award-winning nonfiction bestseller by Bryan Stevenson, the film follows young lawyer Bryan Stevenson (Jordan) and his history-making battle for justice. After graduating from Harvard, Bryan heads to Alabama to defend those wrongly condemned or who were not afforded proper representation. One of his first, and most incendiary, cases is that of Walter McMillian (Foxx), who, in 1987, was sentenced to die for the notorious murder of an 18-year-old girl, despite a preponderance of evidence proving his innocence.
 In the years that follow, Bryan becomes embroiled in a labyrinth of legal and political maneuverings and overt and unabashed racism as he fights for Walter, and others like him, with the odds—and the system—stacked against them.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison has been widely applauded for attempting to rise above party politics in the national response to the pandemic. But Victoria’s decision to throw 250,000 people out of work in Australia’s second-most populous city, Melbourne, with the country’s toughest lockdown threatens to fracture the fragile political truce. Morrison says while his government tried to influence Victoria in confidential meetings, “states have compIete and total control over those types of restrictions.”

For the last 13 years, I’ve been serving on various boards in our community. I’ve served on city boards, such as the Parks and Recreation Board, The Office on Youth Board, and I was elected to the Soil and Water Conservation Board. Most of our city departments have a volunteer citizen board that makes sure they are using our tax dollars wisely and providing a good, quality service to the community. I am on various nonprofit boards, where again, we make sure they are spending money wisely and working towards the mission of their group. Our First Aid Crew, who does life-saving work in our community every day, has a board.
