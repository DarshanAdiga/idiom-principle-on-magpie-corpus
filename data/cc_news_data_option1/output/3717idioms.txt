Chandigarh Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal on Thursday opposed the two farm bills that came up for discussion in the Lok Sabha, saying they go against Punjab's 20 lakh farmers, 30 lakh farm labourers, 30,000 arhtiyas and 3 lakh mandi labourers. He said the proposed laws will "destroy" the 50 years of hard work done by successive Punjab governments to build the farm sector. He recalled Punjab's massive contribution in making India self-sufficient in food grain production as he vehemently opposed the bills. He also announced in the House that Union food processing minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal will resign from the government, which she did in the evening. Sukhbir, who had earlier opposed the bill to amend Essential Commodities Act, was on Thursday participating in the debate on the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion And Facilitation) Bill, 2020, and the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill. The two bills were taken up together for discussion in the Lok Sabha. On Tuesday, he had opposed amendment in Essential Commodities Act. "Our party was not consulted before the ordinances were framed. The centre erred grievously in not taking stakeholders on board," Sukhbir said. "Some states are industrialised, some are tourism intensive, some have information technology industries, while Punjab depends on agriculture. We have focused on agriculture because there was time when our country was fighting hunger. The state accounts for just 2.5% land of the country, but we contributed up to 80% of food requirement in the 1980s and now our contribution is 50%," Sukhbir said. "We are a party of farmers and if they are apprehensive, we will stand with them," he said, adding that if the bills were passed, the purchase of food grain will be monopolised by the corporates. He also clarified that SAD continues to be a constituent of the NDA. "We took up the matter at all fora, and farmers were not satisfied. We can't stand with bills which farmers are opposed to," he said.

AURORA, Colo. (AP) — An officer with the Colorado police department under investigation for the death of Elijah McClain, the young Black man who died after police put him in a stranglehold, has been suspended for one week for pulling a gun on a doctor who was trying to park at a refugee center the doctor operates. A department spokesperson said Officer Justin Henderson was suspended for 40 hours without pay and ordered to attend de- escalation training for his March 1 confrontation with Dr. P.J. Parmar, The Sentinel reported Thursday. The incident gained national attention with the release of police body camera video as well as Parmar's own cellphone video showing Henderson, the white Aurora officer, pointing a gun at Parmar, who is Indian-American, after Parmar honked at the officer’s police car parked in his way. Parmar, who has said he believes his race affected how he was treated, said he was disappointed with the punishment. “It’s not enough,” he told The Sentinel in an email. “That would never fly in the business world —I’ve terminated employees for less. The police pretty much have free rein to do whatever they want.” Parmar’s attorney, David Lane, has said he plans to file a federal lawsuit against the city. In the video, Henderson walks to Parmar’s car, says “Let me see your (expletive) hands. What are you doing?” and orders him to stay in the car. Parmar is heard explaining that he owns the property and telling Henderson to leave. Parmar then gets out, walks around to a door on one side of the building, punches in a security code and goes inside. Colorado’s attorney general is reviewing the Aurora Police Department’s arrest and the subsequent death of McClain, a 23-year-old Black man. Three officers were fired for re-enacting a...

Michal Kwiatkowski won stage 18 of the Tour de France and Richard Carapaz moved into the polka dot jersey as the Ineos Grenadiers set about salvaging their race following the withdrawal of Egan Bernal. Earlier in the day, Irishman Sam Bennett used the intermediate sprint to stretch his advantage over Peter Sagan to 52 points in the battle for the green jersey. Bennett&rsquo;'s Deceuninck-QuickStep team&rsquo;s focus will now be on keeping nearest rival Peter Segan under wraps in tomorrow&rsquo;s rolling Champagnole stage before the arrival in Paris next Sunday. With his job for the day done, Bennett finished the stage safely within the time limit in 137th place, 31'32&quot; behind Kwiatkowsk. Nicholas Roche of Team Sunweb came home in 86th, almost 29 minutes down while Israel Start-Up Nation's Dan Martin finished 109th, 31' 25'' behind the stage winner. Primoz Roglic retained the yellow jersey and his 57-second advantage over fellow Slovenian Tadej Pogacar at the top of the general classification but the day belonged to Ineos, with Kwiatkowski and Carapaz the final two survivors of what had been a 32-man breakaway on the 175km stage from Meribel to La Roche-sur-Foron.The pair made the approach to La Roche-sur-Foron deep in conversation, patting each on the back under the flamme rouge, before Kwiatkowski crossed the line first to give the former world champion his first Grand Tour stage win.Ineos have been active in breaks since Bernal shipped time in Sunday&rsquo;s stage on Le Grand Colombier before withdrawing from the race with a back injury on Wednesday morning following further losses on Tuesday.The win was an emotional one for the popular Kwiatkowski, who has sacrificed his considerable talents in the service of others for several years but got his reward here.&ldquo;That was some day,&rdquo; the 2014 world champion said. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t describe how grateful I am to the whole team and to Richard. It was an incredible day for us and I will never forget that.&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had some nice moments in cycling but that was a new experience. I&rsquo;ve got goosebumps for the last I don&rsquo;t know how many kilometres because I knew the gap is so big that we&rsquo;re going to make it and we both really enjoyed the last kilometres.&ldquo;I think we&rsquo;re going to celebrate big time tonight.&rdquo;Carapaz will need to wait for another shot at his own first Tour stage win, but the reigning Giro d&rsquo;Italia champion got the reward of polka dots instead.The Ecuadorian had been battling Team Sunweb&rsquo;s Marc Hirschi for mountain points as both riders looked to overhaul Pogacar in the category, but a crash for Hirschi on a descent midway through the stage put Carapaz in the driving seat and he now leads the category by two points.The main group of contenders crossed the line a little under two minutes later, with no change at the top.Miguel Angel Lopez remains third and Richie Porte recovered from a puncture at the summit of the last hors categorie climb of the Tour – the Montee du Plateau des Glieres – to cling on to his fourth place, on course for a best career Tour finish in what stands to be his last entry as a team leader.However, Adam Yates lost touch with the yellow jersey group on the final climb and lost two places, dropping back to seventh overall as Spanish duo Mikel Landa and Enric Mas moved up to fifth and sixth respectively.

A resurgence in Covid-19 cases in some countries could further dampen oil demand and interfere with a decline in oil inventories, Reuters has reported, citing an internal document of the OPEC technical panel. Cases have been rising in many European countries, total infections in India have passed 5 million, and new cases are on the rise in some U.S. states. Meanwhile, OPEC itself, as well as the International Energy Agency, earlier this week revised their oil demand outlook for the year. Both are now expecting a bigger contraction than they anticipated a month ago. The IEA now expects 2020 oil demand to be 8.4 million bpd lower than it was a year ago, and OPEC sees it contracting by 9.5 million bpd. That's up from 8.1 million bpd and 9.1 million bpd, respectively, that was forecast just a month ago. At the same time, according to the document, global oil inventories are falling. Commodity trading giant Vitol recently chimed in with this opinion, seeing a strong reduction in oil inventories in the next three months, between 250 and 300 million barrels. Not everyone in the industry agrees, however, with Trafigura, who noted a "supply-heavy market" through the end of the year. Meanwhile, OPEC has dramatically improved its compliance with the production cuts agreed in April to restore balance on the oil market. In August, sources from the cartel told Reuters, compliance hit 101 percent. The improvement followed Saudi Arabia's threat to laggards, which include Iraq and Nigeria, with a reversal of its own cuts if they failed to fall in line and compensate for their overproduction in May and June. Later today, OPEC ministers are meeting to discuss compliance levels and oil's fundamentals amid yet another negative trend in oil prices, driven by the growing worry about demand. Iraq could complicate matters, with recent reports suggesting OPEC's number-two may have plans to increase production the first chance it gets to boost vital oil revenues.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.com
