The Marianna City Farmers’ Market will open its 44th season at 7 a.m. on Saturday, April 4, with some changes enacted this year for safety’s sake in light of the continuing battle to slow the spread of COVID-19.
 The vendors’ trucks will be under the pavilion with their backs to the outside. The tables will be on the perimeter, offering customers something of a drive-thru option. You may view and shop from the comfort and safety of your vehicle, or you may get out and walk about. If you do that, you should keep a six-foot social distance between yourself and others as you browse.
 Some growers might be using debit/credit card processing and some may ask that you not touch the food before purchase. The Jackson County Growers Association has left such safety practices up to the individual farmer, but will oversee the market in general.
 The day starts at 7 a.m. and runs through noon, a schedule that will be kept on market days, Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays, through the spring/summer season. The market is located at the pavilion in Madison Street Park, Marianna. It is expected to remain open through July. The fall season is set for a September start.

The captain of the US aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt told the Pentagon that the coronavirus is spreading uncontrollably through his ship and called for immediate help to quarantine its huge crew, two US newspapers reported Tuesday.
 Captain Brett Crozier wrote in a four-page letter that they had not been able to stem the spread of the COVID-9 virus through the 4,000 crewmembers, describing a dire situation aboard the huge vessel now docked at Guam.
 "We are not at war. Sailors do not need to die," Crozier wrote, according to the San Francisco Chronicle.
 "The spread of the disease is ongoing and accelerating," Crozier wrote, referring to the ship's "inherent limitations of space."
 He asked to be able to quarantine nearly the entire crew onshore at Guam, saying keeping them all on board the ship was an "unnecessary risk."
 "Removing the majority of personnel from a deployed US nuclear aircraft carrier and isolating them for two weeks may seem like an extraordinary measure," he said. "This is a necessary risk."
 The Chronicle said that more than 100 aboard the warship had been confirmed infected with Covid-19.
 Crozier asked in the letter for quarantine facilities for the entire crew on Guam.
 "If we do not act now, we are failing to properly take care of our most trusted asset -- our sailors," he wrote.
 The US Navy did not confirm the contents of the letter, which were also reported by The New York Times.
 In a statement a Navy official, under condition of anonymity, said that Crozier had alerted his Pacific fleet leaders on Sunday of the problems aboard the warship.
 "The ship's commanding officer advocated for housing more members of the crew in facilities that allow for better isolation," the officials said.
 "Navy leadership is moving quickly to take all necessary measures to ensure the health and safety of the crew of USS Theodore Roosevelt, and is pursuing options to address the concerns raised by the commanding officer."
 If the Chronicle's figure of 100 is correct, it suggests confirmed cases have quadrupled since Friday, when the Navy acknowledged the growing problem on the Roosevelt.

“Anything is a canvas to me,” she said. “I’m all the time trying to come up with something new.”
 Things had been looking like 2020 would be a good year. As the COVID-19 pandemic began to be felt locally, Rezabek did window murals for a few restaurants that wanted to let customers know they were still open and offered curbside. Everything has been on hold since.
 “I felt like I helped out just a little bit,” she said.
 At Mr. Coffee Bean on Westgate Parkway in Dothan, Rezabek’s window art tells Chris Green’s customers that the small coffee shop and bakery is still open for takeout orders. Green will even bring it to your car if you’re not comfortable getting out.
 Along with extra cleaning and sanitizing, Green took out tables he had for customers to sit and enjoy their coffee. Now, he has seating spread out for customers willing to wait for orders but who can’t stand for very long.
 “We adjust — just adjust on the fly,” Green said. “I’ve not let anybody go; I’ve not laid anybody off, but I have cut back on man-hours. I was doing about 150 man-hours a week, now I’m down to about 110-ish. I had one employee ask if she could just stay at home.”
 Regular customers are still stopping by for their coffee and cinnamon rolls, including the 2-pound cinnamon rolls that Mr. Coffee Bean has become known for. Some customers are calling orders in or using delivery apps. He had one older couple come in and place an order, telling Green he was on their list of local eateries to support during the closures.
 “The appeal to save the local guy in Dothan is out there,” Green said. “Dothan is a resilient community.”

"What we know about Smith from his journals is that he was an adventurer," she says. "And when you meet Colin that's the sense you get from him. He's bold and wonderfully unedited.

En un comunicado explico que para preservar los empleos y evitar el cierre de empresas, estas requieren contar con flujo de efectivo, lo que se conseguira si se acelera la devolucion del IVA, la compensacion de saldos universales, entre otras cosas.   Agrego que ante los problemas para conectarse a los sistemas informaticos del SAT, las empresas no han logrado presentar las declaraciones anuales en tiempo.   "El Consejo Coordinador Empresarial no pide ningun tipo de reduccion en los impuestos, pero si solicita urgentemente al Gobierno de Mexico la emision de un Decreto a traves del cual se otorguen las siguientes medidas durante el periodo que dure la epidemia Covid-19 en Mexico".   Por ello piden se difiera la fecha de presentacion de la declaracion anual 2019 por al menos 6 meses o permitir enterar el impuesto que resulte en la misma en 12 parcialidades actualizadas, sin recargos.   Permitir la disminucion automatica de todos los pagos provisionales del ejercicio de 2020; asi como el pago de impuestos hasta en 12 parcialidades; agilizar la devolucion de saldos a favor de IVA; compensacion temporal de manera universal de saldos a su favor durante todo el ejercicio de 2020.   "Con estas medidas se permitira que las empresas puedan contar con un minimo de liquidez necesaria, con la finalidad de preservar las fuentes de empleo", dijo el organismo que preside Carlos Salazar.

For me the biggest advantage of a Mac is the better and smoother multitasking. I usually have 2 monitors to work with Ubuntu and Windows, but on a Mac I am completely okay with using one small screen (of course 2 screens are still better even on a Mac). Having a smooth and easy way to fullscreen an application (and hide the topbar) and order them however my needs are is so helpful and really helps productivity. I don't need to remember where the app I need is because if I forget I simply swipe up and get all the screens ordered. If I need to swap to another screen just swipe left or right to the desired screen. I don't know why Windows and Ubuntu dont have a similiar approach to this because the current system of alt+tab is clunky to me compared to Mac. (Maybe they do but not out of the box like on Mac) So if you plan on using your laptop's trackpad without a mouse Mac multitasking experience is really smooth. Apart from that from my experience using Ubuntu and Mac, I don't really see any major benefits to using a Mac over Linux both work well and get the job done. FYI I am a web developer and a student.

The cancellation of multiple sports events related to the coronavirus pandemic could wind up costing the Texas Tech athletic department about $3.4 million.
   
 That's based on early projections and assuming the 2020 college football season is played as scheduled in front of normal crowds, said Jonathan Botros, a Tech senior associate athletic director and the department's chief financial officer.
   
 The $3.4 million is less than 4% of Tech's annual outlay for sports, based on the current fiscal year budget of $93.6 million, but Botros said it's a bigger blow than that might seem.
   
 "It may be small percentagewise, but I think it's still substantial," he said. "Our goal every single year, when we start with all the revenues that we receive, we try to plow all those back into the student-athlete experience and investing in the fan experience.
   
 "It's not our mission, as with any other higher education institution, to maintain a large amount of reserves, or profits, if you will. And so for that reason it's substantial, because we don't have additional revenues to offset that amount. So we would have to start looking at expense budget cuts and/or using reserves to cover it."
   
 The $3.4 million in losses stems from multiple areas, including reduced payouts from the NCAA basketball fund and a share of unrealized ticket sales from the Big 12 basketball tournaments that ended early.
   
 On campus, it includes refunds owed to Tech baseball and softball fans, the loss of gate and concessions revenue in those sports and the loss of food and beverage rent from the Texas Tech Club, which is closing temporarily under the public health disaster declaration.
   
 If all of Tech's seniors in spring sports who could benefit from extra NCAA eligibility return next year, Tech would pick up the tab for an extra $550,000 in scholarships.
   
 Many of Tech's best teams won't get to see how they stack up within the Big 12 and NCAA postseason competition this year, but the cancellation of the remaining spring sports season in response to the pandemic could save the athletic department money in the short term.
   
 Tech is looking at about a $700,000 loss for the rest of the fiscal year from games being canceled but figures to save $1.5 million to $2 million with its teams incurring no more travel costs.
   
 "What that does," Botros said, "is it allows us to hopefully put some of that in reserves to offset the loss that we know we're going to realize, whether it's next year, whether it's split up over the next couple of years, whenever that may be."
   
 All eight of Tech's spring sports teams -- four men's, four women's -- made NCAA postseason play last year. That doesn't include men's basketball, classified as a winter sport, making its run to the championship game of last year's NCAA Tournament.
   
 When their seasons ended prematurely this year, six of Tech's eight spring teams had top-25 national rankings again, with a seventh receiving votes.
   
 Botros emphasized that the savings projection of $1.5 million to $2 million is an estimate, with numbers still being run.
   
 "A lot of that is because in recent years we have increased the budget substantially for postseason travel," he said. "Traveling in the postseason is very expensive. So when you're making deep runs into the NCAA Tournament, when you're making runs to the College World Series each year, you're sending a lot of track and field athletes to nationals ... all these teams, although it's everything we want it to be and everything that we're striving for, it's also very expensive to do so.
   
 "So although we hate that we're not in the postseason this spring, at the same time it will allow us to offset quite a bit of this financial hit by not having those travel expenses."
   
 The shutdown left Tech athletics owing its baseball fans $398,000 worth of refunds on suites, annual seat contributions, season tickets and parking at Dan Law Field/Rip Griffin Park. Botros said a number of fans declined their refunds, instead donating them to the Red Raider Club Excellence Fund in amounts totaling $76,000.
   
 "That was pretty incredible," he said, "and it will absolutely help us offset this huge financial impact that we're looking at here in the next year."
   
 With the cancellation of the NCAA Tournament, the NCAA Board of Governors voted Thursday to reduce its annual distribution to Division I members to $225 million from what was originally projected to be nearly $600 million. Those distributions will be made in June.
   
 Botros said that announcement saved Tech $900,000 compared with his worst-case scenario.
   
 "That was something we were concerned about," he said, "is how they would approach that and whether they would be doing an additional distribution this year. Just finding out they would be giving ($225) million to the conferences, we knew that would pass through to us and help us offset it."
   
 Big 12 Commissioner Bob Bowlsby said the decreased payout means the conference will receive about $10 million instead of $24 million. For Tech, that means a reduction from about $2.4 million to $900,000, Botros said.
   
 "So what that tells me is we're going to lose, one way or another, about $1.5 million there somehow -- unless," Botros said. "That, of course, is money that funnels through the Big 12 Conference, so they still have the opportunity to offset that somehow."
   
 The annual Big 12 revenue distribution related to television contracts has increased 13 years in a row and was $38.8 million per school last year. Bowlsby said any shortfall this school year is likely to be made up by Big 12 reserves and money withheld last year for other purposes.
   
 Big 12 presidents still have to approve such a move.
   
 The cancellation of the Big 12 basketball tournaments cost the conference $6.6 million, Bowlsby said, and Tech is out $660,000 of that amount, Botros said.
   
 Botros said it has not been determined whether Tech will absorb that loss next year or over a multiyear period.
   
 "Really, for us right now, we feel like this is a storm that we can weather in the short term," he said. "Like everybody's been talking about nationally, the big impact is going to be if it affects football. Affecting football really changes everything from a financial standpoint."
   
 Bowlsby said Thursday that even if the coronavirus outbreak subsides relatively soon, he worries it could return to cause more disruption in the fall and winter. He talked about the possibility of the college football season being shortened, scrapped entirely or played in empty stadiums.
   
 Of Tech's current $93.6 million athletic budget, about 76% of the revenue comes from football, Botros said. As is the case on many campuses with Power Five conference and FBS programs, revenue from football covers costs for many other sports teams that typically operate at a net loss.
   
 One cost-saving measure Tech has enacted is limiting overtime opportunities for hourly wage employees. A lot of their duties revolve around sports events going on.
   
 "So without those happening, we have suspended any opportunity for overtime for the foreseeable future," Botros said. "So that's certainly an impact to some of our hourly employees by not being able to get overtime pay.
   
 "But we are making them whole 100% on their normal workweek. So if you had an employee that we only had enough work for them to do from home for maybe five hours, we are allowing them to claim what the university is calling non- working pandemic leave for the remaining 35 hours so that they still get their full paycheck for 40 hours."
   
 In addition to disrupting the sports teams, the shutdown comes at a time when Tech is trying to plan budgets for fiscal year 2021, which will begin Sept. 1.
   
 Botros said he's hoping for more clarity on the football landscape, "because I feel like within two weeks we need to hand our budgets over to our sports and our units to input information, and we hand that over to university officials toward the end of May.
   
 "Are we going to have to cut budgets for FY '21? How are we going to cut budgets for FY '21? In what areas? That's why I'm hoping to get additional information on how much revenue we may be in for losing for FY '21 in the next two weeks."

Dear Dave,   My husband and I just completed Baby Step 3, and we have six months of expenses saved for an emergency fund. How should we determine when something is actually an emergency?   Riley
 Dear Riley,   Congratulations on doing the work, being disciplined and saving like crazy! Now you've got peace of mind, and a pile of cash, that will help turn an emergency into nothing more than an inconvenience.
 There's no shame in using your emergency fund if you really need to. That's what it's there for. Just remember to ask yourself a few questions anytime something pops up to make sure you've got a real reason to use it.
 Is the expense really unexpected? Christmas happens on Dec. 25 every single year. You know your semiannual car insurance payment is coming, too. Make sure things like this are part of your regular, monthly budgets. Some examples of unexpected expenses might be a job loss or pay cut. Emergency medical expenses and car accident repairs might fall into this category, as well.
 Is it absolutely necessary? Most people say they know the difference between a want and a need, but that's not always the case. Replacing your only mode of transportation would be a need. Upgrading to a newer, fancier car is not. If your car goes down for the count, you need transportation. Use your emergency fund to buy something affordable and reliable you can pay cash for. But don't dip into it just to upgrade your decent car for one with a million bells and whistles.
 Is it urgent? Practice the art of patience whenever possible. If your home's air conditioning unit goes out in the middle of summer, that's probably an urgent fix. But hearing about the "sale of the century" at your favorite retail store? Grabbing the newest, hottest cell phone when yours works just fine? Nope!
 Your emergency fund is all about long-term security, not instant gratification. Don't blow it impulsively, but don't be afraid to use it when it's really needed. Be wise, and ask those three questions. Check yourself so you don't wreck yourself - or your budget!   Dave
