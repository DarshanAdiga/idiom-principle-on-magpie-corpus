JERUSALEM (AP) — Eitan Haber, a former journalist and adviser to Yitzhak Rabin who tearfully announced the death of the assassinated Israeli prime minister in 1995, died Wednesday. He was 80. Yediot Ahronot, the Israeli newspaper where Haber spent much of his career, said he died from cancer. Haber covered military affairs for Yediot for 25 years and also appeared on Israeli TV and radio before becoming an adviser to Rabin, who was defense minister, in 1985. He later served as Rabin's bureau chief and speech writer after he was elected prime minister in 1992. When Rabin was gunned down by a Jewish ultra-nationalist at a peace rally on Nov. 4, 1995, it was Haber who announced the news of his death outside a Tel Aviv hospital. “The government of Israel announces in shock, with great sadness and deep sorrow, the death of Prime Minister and Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin, who was murdered by an assassin, tonight in Tel Aviv,” Haber said, his voice shaking, to a crowd of reporters. At Rabin's funeral two days later, with President Bill Clinton and other world leaders watching, Haber read from the blood-covered copy of the Israeli anthem, “Song of Peace,” which Rabin had sung at the peace rally. The paper had been in his pocket when he was shot. Haber later returned to the media and also had a career in business. Israel's figurehead president eulogized Haber as “the knight of the written and accurate word.” “He turned history into words and gave unfortunately moments, masterpieces that shaped the national memory,” Reuven Rivlin said.

"It's always good to be on the winning side," C.B. Bhattacharya, a professor of sustainability and ethics at the University of Pittsburgh, said of Morgan Stanley's motivations in an S&P Global Market Intelligence interview. "Fossil fuels do not have a future. Even banks, which are perennially slow to adapt to these things, they have woken up and have realized that it's now or never."

During his 2016 campaign, Trump proposed the construction of a wall along the US-Mexico border, and has made it a tenet of his immigration policy as President. After taking office, he issued an executive order suspending the entry of people from a number of Muslim-majority countries for 90 days; the order went through several iterations in court before it was upheld. The administration's "zero tolerance" policy in 2018 -- criminal prosecutions of adults who illegally crossed the border -- resulted in thousands of family separations at the border as parents were detained. Under a court order, the government must identify and reunify certain separated children. The President has proposed a merit-based immigration system, establishing a points-based system for green card holders and restricting sponsorship to spouses and minor children. Trump also officially ended Obama-era protections for undocumented immigrants who were brought into the country as children, a decision that has now been taken to the Supreme Court.

Trump on September 24 laid out what he called his "vision" for health care in America, but the two executive orders Trump said he was going to sign fall far short of a comprehensive proposal. Trump said he was signing an executive order to protect Americans with pre-existing conditions, even as Trump and Republican lawmakers attempt to try to tear down the Affordable Care Act that already protects them. The second executive order directs Congress to pass legislation to address surprise medical billing by the end of the year, and if lawmakers don't achieve this, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar will seek to do so via executive or regulatory action. Trump campaigned against the Affordable Care Act on the runup to his presidency. While the Republican-controlled Congress failed to repeal the law, Trump has taken a number of executive actions to undermine it, including making it easier for Americans to access alternative policies that have fewer protections and benefits. The administration is also seeking to invalidate the landmark health care law through the courts. Trump has promised to reduce drug prices and unveiled a blueprint to do so in 2018. Bucking long-standing Republican beliefs, the President is pushing to allow drug importation, particularly from Canada, and to tie the price of drugs in the US to their cost in other developed nations. However, several of his efforts have been stymied, including requiring drug makers to include their list prices in TV ads, which was nixed by a federal judge in summer 2019. In an effort to lower health care costs overall, the administration also issued a rule requiring hospitals to post the rates they negotiate privately with health insurers, starting in 2021. A coalition of major hospital groups took legal action to block the requirement.
