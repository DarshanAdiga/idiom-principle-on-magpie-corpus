Tony Raines is a NASCAR veteran who was named 1999 Busch Series Rookie of the Year.


  Raines was born April 14, 1964, in Glasgow, Montana. He is a 1982 graduate of LaPorte High School.


  In July 2010, Raines told The Times he had visited his mother in Wanatah and the LaPorte County Fair.


  "We don't get to visit Indiana much because we're traveling all the time," Raines said. "You look forward to it because you're only going to be here once. Next week, we're in Iowa, off and running again."


  Before entering the NASCAR circuit, Raines competed in the now defunct American Speed Association. He won the championship in 1996.


  Between 2002 and 2013, Raines was in 180 races. His average finish was 30.26, including three top 10 finishes and 32 in the top 20.

 Strack & Van Til Chief Operating Officer Dave Wilkinson said the supermarket chain always donates to feed the needy since it is in the food business, but that help was especially and direly needed this year at a time when long lines have stretched down the road at food panties in Merrillville and Portage.
 "With the pandemic there's a lot of food insufficiency," he said. "People are out of work. We want to help feed the hungry in the areas we serve."

Last week I noted the coaching staff’s obvious efforts to get freshman wide receiver Gary Bryant Jr. involved in the game. This week, the 18-year-old’s only touch on offense was a toss that lost 4 yards, but he left his mark on the game with what was easily the biggest play of his young career so far. Trailing by one with 52 seconds remaining in the game, Bryant ran back the UCLA kickoff 56 yards to put the Trojans at the UCLA 43, on the cusp of field goal range. The Trojans would of course go on to score a touchdown to win the game, and Bryant couldn’t have had a bigger moment to help set it up. His explosiveness with the ball in his hands is spectacular -- he was bound to come up with a big play sooner or later.

In the United Kingdom, people lined up for Pfizer's vaccine, the first to get the nod from health regulators there. The inoculation showed a 95 percent efficacy in trials. The vaccine does not contain live virus. It has mRNA from the spike protein of SARS CoV-2.      “When it enters your cells, the cells read the mRNA of the protein which is expressed on the surface of the cell,” Novak said. “And then the immune system sees that and recognizes it doesn’t belong there and starts to make an immune response to it.”      The body recognizes the manufactured spike protein to learn how to react when the real thing takes hold and kick the immune system into overdrive.

“I mean, we always say, ‘If they don’t score, they don’t win,’” top corner James Bradberry said. “That’s our goal as a defense, we don’t worry about special teams or what the offense is doing, we just worry about what we can control.”


  The backbreaker came to open the second half, when the Cardinals marched 77 yards in 11 plays, sparked by a 36-yard Drake run through a Love missed tackle. Drake punched in a one-yard touchdown and that was all she wrote.


  Jabrill Peppers and the D played hard the whole day, and Peppers and David Mayo both forced fumbles later, but the Cardinals fell on the ball both times. It just wasn’t the Giants’ day.


  Murray, who hadn’t run the ball more than five times in either of the Cardinals’ last three games, used his legs more and showcased a rocket arm. The Giants’ pass rush did very little in the game, hitting Murray only four times and sacking him once (Dalvin Tomlinson cleaned up a Jabaal Sheard pressure).

Fourteen people believed to have traveled from Venezuela to Trinidad and Tobago were found dead in waters near the South American nation's coast, Venezuelan authorities said on Sunday, hours after Trinidad and Tobago confirmed the first bodies being found.
 At least 40,000 Venezuelans live in Trinidad and Tobago, the majority fleeing their country's economic crisis, unemployment and lack of basic public services, often traveling in small rickety boats above their capacity, with limited supplies of fuel and food.Last year, at least two ships that set off from Venezuela en route to the archipelago disappeared at sea.
 The bodies were found on Saturday, 7 nautical miles off the Venezuelan coastal town of Guiria, the Venezuela government statement said.
 It added that the first 11 bodies appeared late on Saturday afternoon, while the bodies of two men and one woman appeared on Sunday. No one has come forward to formally report the disappearances, it said.
 Venezuelan authorities are investigating, the statement added, and they have not ruled out the possible involvement of criminal groups in the Guiria area.
 Trinidad and Tobago's statement said preliminary information suggested the lives lost could be related to a boat that left Guiria, in the northeast of Sucre state, on Dec. 6 with more than 20 people on board who have not been seen or heard from since.
 Omalirves, who did not provide her last name, said she had warned her friend Noebis Aspudillo, 27, who had been a passenger on the boat, about the precarious journey. Aspudillo had gotten increasingly desperate during the pandemic, Omalirves said, after she was laid off from the bread shop where she worked and her mother's heart condition got increasingly severe.
 Venezuela's prosecutor's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
 Trinidad and Tobago's coast guard said it had not intercepted any vessels in the past week leaving from Guiria and that authorities were working with Venezuela in a joint search effort.

As always, everything for this USC team begins, and ends with Kedon Slovis.


  It began poorly. Slovis turned it over on the Trojans’ first offensive possession, firing an ill-advised pass on third-and-16 straight to a Bruins defender by the sideline. Neither he nor the rest of the USC offense got going through the early stages of the game, and quickly enough the Trojans found themselves in a 14-0 hole. The defense was being tested as it hadn’t been in weeks, and the offense had no answers through the air and even fewer on the ground. Slovis was playing well, but not well enough to keep his team in the game. The Trojans seemed to be on the brink of an embarrassing blowout loss to their hated rivals halfway through the second quarter; another scoreless possession from USC followed by another UCLA score would likely have been a death knell.


  Without warning, Slovis ripped off the longest play of the year for USC, stepping up through the pocket to find Drake London deep downfield, with London subsequently running around and through what felt like half the UCLA defense on his way to the Trojans’ first touchdown. Instantly, the tenor of the game changed, and Slovis began to click. He dominated the remainder of the game, feeding each of his top three receivers and amassing 344 passing yards and 5 touchdowns. Though he threw a couple of bad balls reminiscent of the kind he had in the early weeks of the season, Slovis was mostly on the money just as he was last week. He was brilliant navigating the pocket and making good progressions, avoiding costly decisions after he got the game-opening pick out of his system.


  His trademark accuracy was on display again as he placed his passes with the kind of precision we’d come to expect from him last year. He hits serious NFL throws every week; throws that a number of quarterbacks at the highest level still struggle to make. Watch the way he placed the deep balls for Tyler Vaughns, the way he zips the ball all the way up the sideline to Amon-Ra St. Brown on a deep out without letting it dip, or the way he finds receivers across his body as he did on the go-ahead touchdown to London. Slovis’ gifts make him one of the best quarterbacks in college; his mental makeup gives him the potential to be much more. His veins are ice; the sophomore seems unshakeable in the biggest of moments. Slovis was cold-blooded once again in the final frame of the game, making big-time throws without fear and delivering time after time.


  Down by 1 with under a minute remaining, he twice called his own shot to audible into a pass play, resulting in the 35-yard bomb down the sideline to Vaughns and the touchdown to St. Brown that followed. Once again, Slovis delivered for USC when it mattered most. Three times now just this year, he’s exploded in the fourth quarter to bring the Trojans back from the brink of disaster. He’s simply a different kind of beast in the final quarter.

That's when a chaotic situation ensued with the Panthers rushed to the line to get a play off before the 2-minute warning -- one that resulted in an costly incompletion.
 Rhule, who didn't have any timeouts at his disposal, said he never wanted that play run and would have preferred for the clock to run down to 2-minute warning and get reorganized.
 After the timeout, Bridgewater faced a fourth-and-8, was forced out of the pocket and threw underneath the coverage to Curtis Samuel, who was tackled for a 1-yard gain, turning the ball over on downs.
 "Maybe he's thinking (Samuel) outruns him and it's a first down," Rhule said. "But those were plays that were not good enough plays to win the game."
 And those are the type of plays that have resulted in the Panthers (4-9) losing seven of their last eight games.
 "It comes down to us making the plays when the plays matter," Rhule said. "We just have to execute. There is not much else to say other than that. We have to get the job done. We took a sack. Just a bunch of mistakes. We have to play better when it matters.
 But Rhule said he's not giving up on this team and building for the future.
 "I'm going to keep coming to work and keep fighting, scratching and clawing to get guys to understand that what you do really matters," Rhule said, "You say, 'Oh, my bad.' You can only say that so many times. ... Even when it seems mundane or even when it seems trivial, you have to go do your job for us to win. That's where we are. I don't believe in panic. I don't believe in huge, huge, huge changes in the middle of the season. I think you go through the season and you try to do what you do better."

Former White Sox slugger Ron Kittle was never afraid of hard work.


  Kittle was born in Gary on Jan. 5, 1958. He was one of six children born to Jim, an ironworker in the steel mills, and Dorothy Kittle.


  Kittle took to baseball at a young age, and his father began coaching him at age 6 in the Aetna Little League.


  Kittle told The Times when his father died in 1994 that his dad was his "biggest fan and hardest critic."


  The future power-hitter spent his freshman year at Andrean High School before transferring to Wirt High School where he played baseball for legendary coach Jerry Troxel.


  Kittle was drafted by the Dodgers in 1976 after a tryout camp in LaPorte. In his first official game in the Midwest League, Kittle broke his neck when a catcher stepped on it while he was sliding into home.


  He thought his baseball days were over and went to work in the steel mills as an ironworkers' apprentice. He said the hard manual labor helped him regain his strength.


  He tried out for the Sox in 1978 after being scouted by the late Billy Pierce and they signed him to a contract. He made his Major League debut in 1982 and earned the American League Rookie of the Year Award in 1983 with 35 home runs and 100 RBIs.


  He stayed with the Sox through 1986 and hit seven career rooftop shots at old Comiskey Park, a Major League record.


  Kittle wore jersey No. 42 for most of his career, the number worn by Jackie Robinson. Major League Baseball retired the number for all teams in 1997 in Robinson's memory.


  The designated hitter, left fielder and occasional first baseman played for the Yankees, Indians and Orioles but returned to the Sox in 1989 and 1990 and briefly again in 1991, the year he played his last game.


  In 1989, Kittle founded Indiana Sports Charities to support cancer research and education. The organization hosted annual celebrity golf tournaments in the Region and later, motorcycle runs.


  After he retired from baseball, Kittle went on to manage the Schaumburg Fliers nonaffiliated minor league team from 1998 to 2001.


  In 2005, he wrote "Ron Kittle's Tales from the Chicago White Sox Dugout," sharing his life's story and anecdotes from his years in baseball.


  Kittle is co-owner of the Northwest Indiana Oilmen, a Midwest Collegiate League team in Whiting.


  He also makes hand-crafted benches and chairs from bats, bases and baseballs, often for current and retired players and for charities. He currently serves as a White Sox ambassador.


  The father of two made his home for years in Chesterton before moving to the far southern suburb of Mokena.

Before the likes of West Side star Dana Evans came around, it was Angela Hamblin who starred in the Steel City.


  One of the greatest female players in Region history, Hamblin was a mega-star at now-defunct Lew Wallace. She finished her career with 2,053 career points. In her senior year, she averaged 26.2 points, 18 rebounds, 5.3 steals and two blocks a game. She finished third in the voting for Miss Basketball and was an Indiana All-Star.


  She continued her basketball career at the University of Iowa, where she was an All Big-Ten player and earned Big Ten Tournament MVP honors her junior year.


  Hamblin was drafted in the third round (23rd overall) by the Washington Mystics in the 1998 WNBA Draft. She was waived by the Mystics on June 10, 1998, and signed by the Detroit Shock on July 18 of that same year. Hamblin played six games for the Shock that season and was waived on May 6, 1999. She also played semipro ball until an Achilles heel injury several years ago ended her playing days.


  She returned to coach at Lew Wallace in 2005 before winding up at Lake Central High School, after leaving Glen Park in 2009. She was part of the L.C. coaching staff that won the 2011 sectional championship.


  As of 2014, Hamblin lived in Gary. She has two daughters, who are also talented players.

Born in Merrillville, Eugene Wilson went on to star for the hometown Pirates, eventually leading to a collegiate and professional football career where he won two Super Bowl rings with the New England Patriots.


  At Merrillville, Wilson was a letterman in football and basketball. He was a two-time All-State selection and, as a senior, was named the Duneland Athletic Conference's defensive player of the year. In basketball, he was a four-year varsity letterman and starter, and was a two-time All-DAC selection.


  He attended the University of Illinois, where he majored in speech communications. The safety finished his career with 176 tackles (139 solo, 37 assists), 11 interceptions and 60 pass deflections. He also had 93 punt returns for 896 yards and two touchdowns.


  Wilson was selected in the second round (36th overall) of the 2003 NFL Draft. He helped the Patriots win Super Bowl XXXVIII in 2003 and Super Bowl XXXIX in 2004. In '04, he recovered a fumble by Philadelphia Eagles tight end L.J. Smith before leaving the game after sustaining an injury on a kickoff. He also intercepted Ben Roethlisberger in a 41-27 win over the Pittsburgh Steelers in 2004 AFC Championship.


  In 2007 against the New York Jets, Wilson returned a Kellen Clemens interception for a touchdown, making him the 21st Patriot to score a touchdown that season, tying an NFL record. Wilson bounced around in 2008, signing with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on March 14 before being released Sept. 1 that same year. Two days after his release, he was signed by the Houston Texans, where he had an interception in a win over the Tennessee Titans on Sept. 20.


  On February 18, 2011, the Texans released Wilson. He played 96 games in his eight-year career finishing with 399 tackles, four fumble recoveries, 41 pass deflections and 14 interceptions.

CHAMPAIGN, Ill.
 Illinois fired coach Lovie Smith on Sunday with a game left in its ninth consecutive losing season.
 Smith became Illinois' first Black head football coach when he was hired by athletic director Josh Whitman in March 2016. The longtime NFL coach went 17-39 in five seasons at the school.
 Smith's original deal was for six years and $21 million, but he received a two-year extension through 2023 after Illinois went 4-8 in his third season.
 "When we brought Lovie on board, we had a lot of needs; we needed a steady hand, an experienced voice, someone who would bring credibility to the program," Whitman said during a Zoom press conference.
 "At the end of the day, we weren't able to win enough games or quite get over the hump despite the best efforts."

Drake Jackson continues to win games for the Trojans. He and the other Drake remind me of one another; both legitimate stars in only their sophomore years who shine in the biggest moments. Against Arizona, Jackson sealed the win with a crucial sack of Grant Gunnell in the last seconds. In his second career UCLA game he again came up huge when it mattered most, stuffing Dorian Thompson- Robinson behind the line of scrimmage on a key third-and-2 with less than a minute left in the game. His stop forced a field goal and gave USC the time on the clock to squeak out another score to win the game. Jackson was a force all night long, finishing with 5 tackles, 2.5 of which were for loss, along with other QB pressures that disrupted the Bruins' offensive plans. He’s a foundational piece on the USC defense already, and he still has a long way to go before he nears his ceiling. Jackson’s future is bright; he might be the Trojans’ best D-line prospect since Leonard Williams.

After only handing the ball off 16 times for 25 yards last week, it didn’t seem likely that the rushing attack was going to be a significant part of USC’s efforts against UCLA. The Bruins had been stout against the run all year, allowing only 3.68 yards per carry, so the Trojans' struggles on the ground seemed fated to continue. In the early going Saturday, it indeed seemed that would be the case once again. The Trojans skewed dramatically pass-heavy, and what run game there was wasn’t very productive. From the jump however, Vavae Malepeai found ways to generate yardage on his carries with his vision. His ability to be patient behind blocks and to see cutback lanes as they form is his best attribute, and it allowed him to find success against the Bruins run defense. He thrived against the 6 and 7-man boxes UCLA was in throughout the night, showing trust in his blocking and winning with his reads. Whether by prior design or by virtue of simply feeding the hot hand, the USC coaching staff decided to ride Malepeai as the Trojans’ lead back for the night. The senior wound up with 19 carries, the most of any USC back this season, and took them for 110 yards, becoming the first Trojan to cross the hundred-yard mark on the ground this year.


  He was instrumental to the resurgence of USC’s offense in the second half, providing the team with a legitimate rushing option, contributing at a high- level in pass protection, and coming up with a key touchdown in the waning phases of the game. Though the rest of the backfield remained unproductive and the net rushing total for USC remained a paltry 100 yards, Malepeai’s impact on the game showed the potential of USC’s running backs. This rushing offense is not very good and that won’t change anytime soon, but USC’s backs are still talented enough to change the complexion of games when given opportunity to do so. When given the right situation, there might be something to be gained by leaning on one rusher or another. This was the case with Malepeai and a UCLA defense vulnerable to the kind of cutback lanes his vision allows him to exploit. In another matchup, it might be Markese Stepp’s power against a smaller front-7 -- so on and so forth. One way or another, I’m inclined to think sticking to the idea of a lead back would help this offense, even if who that is changes from game to game.

Bridget Pettis, an East Chicago native and 1989 E.C. Central High School graduate, has been a part of the WNBA since its inception in 1997.


  The seventh overall pick of the Phoenix Mercury in the inaugural WNBA Draft, she played eight seasons in the association with the Mercury and Indiana Fever, appearing in a franchise-record 154 consecutive games with Phoenix. Over an eight-season career, Pettis scored 1,408 points in 228 games.


  Pettis served as assistant coach with Phoenix from 2006-2009, winning two WNBA championships. She was director of basketball operations from 2010-11 with Phoenix and then an assistant coach with the Los Angeles Sparks in 2013. She joined the Tulsa Shock staff in 2014 and remains in that capacity with the franchise, which relocated to Dallas in 2015.

East Chicago native Kenny Lofton enjoyed a 17-year career in Major League Baseball as a skilled center fielder and a premier lead off man and base stealer.


  Lofton graduated in 1985 from East Chicago Washington High. He attended the University of Arizona where he was torn between playing baseball or basketball, Lofton told Times sportswriter Glenn Minnis in 1993.


  “I didn’t really have a preference,” he said. “I loved them both and if it was left up to me, I’d be playing both professionally right now.”


  The Houston Astros drafted the 25-year-old speedster in the 17th round of the 1988 draft. He recorded the most triples (17) of any professional baseball player on any level while playing for Houston’s AAA team in Tucson, and then being brought up to the majors in 1991.


  The Astros traded him to the Cleveland Indians where Lofton hit .285 in his first full year, setting an American League rookie record by stealing 66 bases. He had 15 doubles, eight triples, five homers and 42 RBI, and was second in voting for AL Rookie of the Year.


  By 1993 he was chosen the AL’s “Most Exciting Player,” “Best Bunter” and “Fastest Baserunner” in a poll of major league managers.


  Lofton had three tours of duty with the Indians and played single seasons with the Atlanta Braves, New York Yankees, Philadelphia Phillies and Los Angels Dodgers; the White Sox, the San Francisco Giants, the Cubs, The Pittsburgh Pirates and Texas Rangers.


  Northwest Indiana baseball great Dan Plesac told The Times’ Al Hamnik, “Kenny had a real good idea of the strike zone. He wasn’t afraid to take pitches, he could bunt, he could hit in the alleys and he had a little bit of pop, too.”


  Lofton last worked in the majors in 2007. He now owns his own television production company, FilmPool Inc.

While the latter two seasons drop the ball a little in terms of complex themes, season 1 of Jessica Jones is a force to be reckoned with. Somehow managing to be a superhero detective _noir,_ the series entwines subject matter like rape, assault and PTSD into its many facets. Krysten Ritter was _the_ perfect choice to take on the dry, sarcastic, rough-around-the-edges hero who could also be the occasional asshole. With a mind-controling villain like David Tennant's Kilgrave, who can literally tell people to kill themselves, the wall our hero must scale to save the day is absolutely staggering.
