BRAINTREE -- After Kyle LaVigne grounded back to the mound to end the top of the second inning on Thursday night, P.J. Thompson couldn't help himself as he jogged back to the dugout after coaching third base.
 "We scored!" he yelled.
 Normally, getting on the board early in a game wouldn't be cause for major celebration for the Braintree White Sox, who led the Cranberry Baseball League in runs by a wide margin -- 132 over 20 regular-season games for an average of 6.6 per outing.
 The bats, though, had gone ice cold lately, which pushed the Sox into rare territory -- fighting for their playoff lives.
 Luckily, they responded.
 Two days after getting blanked, 1-0, by the Weymouth Shamrocks, the top-seeded White Sox looked more like their usual slugging selves. Rick Smith hit a two- run bomb in the second, Lyle Allen swatted a leadoff homer in the fourth, and James Garnett added a sizzling, two-run double in the sixth as Braintree beat Weymouth, 5-1, at Braintree High School to win its double-elimination bracket.
 The White Sox (23-3) advance to the best-of-three championship series against the third-seeded Acushnet Aztecs (14-9). Acushnet, which boats the league's Pitcher of the Year (Zack Kirby) and Rookie of the Year (Zach Sylvia), eliminated the Rockland Cardinals, 7-0, on Thursday.
 The Sox, who have won 16 of the last 22 Cranberry crowns, including three straight, will host a doubleheader on Sunday beginning at noon at BHS. Game 3, if necessary, would be played on Tuesday.
 Braintree only managed six hits -- the same number they had in Tuesday's shutout loss -- but they made them count this time.
 "We've got a lot of guys who can hit," said Allen, a 31-year-old Kingston resident. "We just had to put together some good at-bats and we did that tonight and good things happened."
 "That was a much better night at the plate," agreed White Sox manager/GM P.J. Thompson. "The other night we had a couple of balls that we hit pretty hard and we had a couple of at-bats that were solid, but not a typical night for us at the dish. Tonight guys had a better approach and made adjustments during their at-bats instead of waiting until the next at-bat a couple of innings later."
 The White Sox came into this one with some troubling trends. They had scored one run total in their previous two games -- a 1-0 win over the South Shore Diamond Dogs followed by the 1-0 loss to Weymouth. Plus, the Shamrocks had blanked them in the teams' last regular-season meeting, too. In fact, Weymouth pitchers had combined to throw 16 2/3 consecutive scoreless innings against the White Sox before Smith launched a 1-1 fastball over the fence in left field in the second inning to turn a 1-0 deficit into a 2-1 lead.
 It was his first home run of the summer.
 "It felt good to give us a lead and help our pitcher out," said Smith, a 24-year-old catcher who played at Merrimack. "Obviously, we came out flat in that first game (against Weymouth). We knew we had to jump on them early."
 "That was massive," Thompson said of Smith's blast. "It gets that monkey off your back. Rick put together a good at-bat and absolutely turned on one. Big relief there. Big relief."
 Smith was part of a key defensive play in the bottom of the first inning. Weymouth grabbed a 1-0 lead when White Sox third baseman Erik Turgeon couldn't handle Kyle Sylvester's sharp, two-out grounder with the bases loaded. The ball kicked over to shortstop Will Brennan, who threw home to nail Matty Cunningham trying to score from second base. That prevented an even bigger inning.
 "It could have (been worse), yes," Smith said. "That definitely helped us."
 Said Thompson: "Will Brennan's the type of player where you don't see his contributions on the stat sheet every night but that's the type of (heads-up) play he makes frequently and it's why he's a huge contributor for us."
 Allen, who played two years at the University of Georgia and did a stint in the Cape Cod Baseball League, made it 3-1 with his solo shot in the fourth, and fellow newcomer Garnett applied the finishing touches in the sixth.
 That was more than enough pop for White Sox pitchers Riley Sorenson (win) and Paul Fahey (three-inning save). Fahey pounded the zone, throwing 31 of his 40 pitches for strikes. He got to two strikes on seven of the 10 batter he faced.
 "Paul's a tough arm to hit," Thompson said. "If he gets up on you early (in the count) it's going to be a long night. He does a good job of getting the ball and throwing strikes. He comes in with a tough arm angle and absolutely gets on guys."
 While the White Sox gear up for another title chase, the Shamrocks have to be content with making what manager Brian Fisher called a "huge step forward" with solid 12-11-2 record in Year 2 of the program.
 "It was an awesome year," said Fisher, who grew up in Norwell and played soccer and baseball at Archbishop Williams High. "Coming into the season it was so up in the air whether we were going to play. Considering we got in 20-plus games, it was almost like a miracle. No (positive COVID-19) cases, at least none that anybody knew of. Huge success. A lot of (men's amateur baseball) leagues didn't play, and we did. That looks really good for the league."

A first-degree murder charge was dropped in Ontario Court earlier this month when Terry Chad Stuckless agreed to plead guilty to manslaughter in the shooting death of Gerald Robert Male.
 On April 5, 2019, Stuckless, 34, shot Male, 37, at Male's William Street home and was sentenced to a 12- year prison sentence, which was reduced by two years to account for time served.
 The plea deal angered the victim's family.
 "I totally think it's wrong," said Male's father, Gerry Male, Sr.
 "The police laid a first-degree murder charge and they had their reasons for it. If they had a tough time proving first-degree murder, at least the case was there for second-degree, no question."
 Instead, Male said he and his wife, Jana, and their daughter, Larissa Miller, left court "devastated."
 Crown attorney Shane Hickingbottom said Stuckless was "offended and upset" after arguing with Male several days before the shooting.
 "He was aware Gerry Male was home alone that night and paid a visit, telling a person he intended to scare Male and shoot him in the leg."
 Stuckless took a .22 calibre semi-automatic rifle with a sawed-off barrel to Male's home just after 11 p.m., had further words with Male and shot him in the upper chest.
 Nine days later, Brantford police found the gun and Stuckless was soon charged with first-degree murder, a charge that reflects planning and intention. First-degree murder carries an automatic life sentence with no possibility of parole for 25 years.
 Justice Gethin Edward asked the Crown attorney to explain on the record why the first-degree murder charge was dropped.
 "In a case like this, there are only two individuals who were present when the act occurred," said Hickingbottom.
 "There's no direct evidence. We can prove he attended there with a firearm and there had been some animosity but the reliability of some of the witnesses, had we gone to trial, would have proved difficult."
 In court, the family poured out their grief to the judge about Male, known as "Robbie."
 "We are haunted by what happened," said his father.
 "What went through our son's mind when he opened the door? Did he suffer, laying alone and feeling his life ebb away? These are torturing thoughts that haunt us in our waking moments and keep us from sleeping at night."
 He said his son loved nature and the Grand River and despite falling into the world of addictions, never lost his core values.
 "He had a big heart and an infectious smile and laugh. He would help anyone and not judge them but accept who they were."
 Miller said her brother was her only sibling and best friend.
 "He was the most beautiful, non-judgmental guy and always helped people, no matter what. To think the person before us had the audacity to shoot him and leave him to die alone - I can't even begin to imagine what went through my brother's mind."
 Stuckless input was short. "I'd just like to apologize to the victim's family" he said.
 Hickingbottom asked for a 12-year sentence, while the defence attorney asked the judge to consider a 10-year sentence.
 Edward called the shooting "malicious."
 "The accused went to the victim's residence and shot him in cold blood. I worry that, with the current drug epidemic and easy access to guns, these tragedies will continue to play out."
 The judge said is difficult to speak to the technicalities that reduced the charge to manslaughter from murder but noted that the matter has been resolved in a legally appropriate manner.
 While agreeing with the Crown for a global sentence of 12 years, the judge gave Stuckless extra credit for time served due to COVID-19 circumstances, leaving him with 10 years left to serve.
 "What's the justice in that?" asked Male's father.
 "The whole criminal justice system needs a major overhaul."

At an Aug. 7 press conference, Gov. Charlie Baker lamented reports of pool parties, birthday parties and holiday parties documented by contact tracers, held in homes and backyards across the state that have contributed significantly, he said, to community spread of the coronavirus and clusters of infected people.
 "These parties are too big, too crowded, and people are not being responsible about social distancing, face coverings, or anything that we have put into place to help manage the spread of this virus," Baker said. "If you give this virus an opportunity to move, it will."
 As a result of these private parties and other instances of noncompliance, state numbers of positive cases started inching back up, Baker said, and he indefinitely postponed the next step in the state's reopening plan.
 Baker also issued executive orders intended, in part, to help overworked municipal health departments. He rolled back the allowable number of people at indoor and outdoor gatherings, and created a new enforcement task force that included state and local police, local boards of health and the state Alcoholic Beverages Control Commission. Baker also cited powers granted to him under his March 10 declaration of a state of emergency to allow health inspectors and police the ability to enforce public health mandates at private parties and gatherings.
 Both health officials and police had been confounded by how they could legally enforce COVID-19 public health mandates on private property. Unlike noise complaints, which are based on town bylaws that define the limits of the distance and sound level that a private party or business can generate, police and health agents felt a similar regulation or bylaw was needed to allow for enforcement of masking, social distancing, the number of guests and other public health mandates to curtail the spread of COVID-19.
 While Baker's executive order does address that, Cape police departments, and others across the state, remain hesitant and have asked his administration for more guidance.
 "There are other legalities attached to going on someone's property without warning," said Yarmouth Police Chief Frank Frederickson. "It's new ground, so we're going to go carefully."
 Chatham Police Chief Mark Pawlina felt Baker's revised order was helpful in reducing the number of people allowed at indoor gatherings to a maximum of 25 and 50 outdoors, but he would like to go beyond the governor's executive orders and see the legal underpinnings laid out.
 Cape police chiefs and health agents interviewed for this story found that, generally, the public has been compliant with both state and municipal orders. It's allowed police to focus on education as a way to achieve compliance. Many officers carry masks and none interviewed had issued citations or taken other enforcement actions.
 Some health agents, however, have been busy with enforcement issues.
 Barnstable's health division has responded to 311 COVID-19 complaints since February, said director Thomas McKean.
 Yarmouth Health Director Bruce Murphy said his department has received over 100 complaints about restaurants, businesses and individuals. He has received enforcement assistance from the state Department of Labor Standards in issuing orders to businesses that have received multiple warnings, but like police chiefs and other municipal officials, he has yet to get any guidance from the Baker administration on how the new enforcement policy will work.
 "It's not diminishing the governor's declaration, but it puts us on thin ice in terms of whether we are enforcing something that is truly enforceable," Pawlina said.
 The quandary lies in balancing a public health crisis with private property and privacy rights.
 "The whole private property issue is of great concern to our members," said Mark Leahy, a retired police chief and executive director of the Massachusetts Chiefs of Police Association. Leahy said his association is awaiting further guidance from the governor's legal staff. He said Attorney General Maura Healy's office shared some of their concerns. Pawlina said that Cape chiefs have asked Cape & Islands District Attorney Michael O'Keefe's office for help.
 Wellfleet Police Chief Michael Hurley understands that there may be the need for the greater power accorded to police.
 "The health agent and the board of health can't use force or take people's liberty away," he said, but the reality is that police are under the microscope following the death of George Floyd in Minnesota.
 "It puts us in a tough spot," Hurley said. "I'd hate to see a mask call go from good to bad or worse."
 The American Civil Liberties Union in Massachusetts also had concerns. In an email, it said public health experts found that voluntary compliance got better results than government enforcement. The ACLU was also concerned it might disproportionately impact Black and brown communities.
 "The ACLU will be reviewing this policy and its implementation carefully, particularly as it pertains to possible elevated levels of enforcement in high-risk communities, to ensure that it does not unduly undermine civil rights and civil liberties, and does not include unreasonable or discriminatory enforcement," the union wrote in the email. "Massachusetts can and must do better than relying on policing as means of keeping communities of color safe from COVID-19."
 Rev. Will Mebane, pastor of St. Barnabas Episcopal Church in Falmouth, echoed that concern.
 "There's too much evidence that such police actions are not applied evenly across the board," he said. "The people with means and access to expensive lawyers who have political influence might get treated differently than those without."
 Mebane, who is Black and originally from North Carolina, said he appreciated the job Baker has done in reducing the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths. But he felt that feelings in Black communities were so raw right now that an expansion of police powers might be tough to take.
 Like Mebane, Barnstable community activist Jesse Barboza, who is also Black, agreed that something had to be done to address those who were refusing to comply. For his daughter's second birthday, he held three separate celebrations with 10 guests rather than risk one large one.
 "I do understand the ACLU point, I get it 100%, but I don't know what we should do right now other than be safe," Barboza said. "Everybody is a rookie when it comes to coronavirus and we're all trying to do the best we can."

THE FACTS: False posts circulating on Facebook and Twitter claim that Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has proposed a staggering tax increase for families making $75,000 a year. A current federal tax rate of 12 percent applies to families making up to $80,000, or individuals making up to $40,000. That would still apply under Biden, who has vowed publicly not to raise taxes on anyone making less than $400,000. "Nobody making under $400,000 bucks would have their taxes raised. Period. Bingo," Biden said in an interview on CNBC in May. Biden has proposed increasing the corporate tax rate to 28 percent. He has also proposed a 12.4 percent Social Security tax for income above $400,000, in addition to rolling back the 2018 tax cuts that President Donald Trump signed into law for those making $400,000 or more. An analysis of his tax plan performed by University of Pennsylvania's Penn Wharton Budget Model in March found that the bottom 90 percent of income earners would not pay more in federal income taxes under Biden's proposal. Another analysis of Biden's tax plan by the Tax Policy Center, a non-partisan think tank in Washington, D.C., predicted a slight increase for the bottom 99 percent of earners. On average, the report said earners in varying brackets could pay between an extra $30 to $590, as a result of Biden's tax plan. But that increase, the Tax Policy Center said, would not be the result of Biden directly raising taxes on those earners. Instead, the Tax Policy Center predicted workers would indirectly pay more because of Biden's plan to increase the corporate tax, a cost which some employers could pass along in ways to their own employees.

_Peninsula_ still offers lessons that we can apply to our own lives. In addition to the subject of atonement, the director showcases the immense and often destructive power of money, reminding us it can't buy happiness. It's a frequent theme that appears in Korean films (let's take _Parasite_ , for example) as a criticism of its own society, to teach people a lesson that money can also lead to misery if it's used to do evil. It's also interesting to see that even in a land where zombies have ravaged an entire country, people still care more for money than others' lives. This sequel is definitely weaker than its first part. Still, it's a great watch for someone who likes to read between the lines and understands a message that relates to our world and humanity. On top of flesh-eating zombies, blood galore, and limbs being severed, the audience is taught life lessons which makes _Peninsula_ a worthy watch, even if it's not as outstanding as the first. In that aspect, Yeon Sang-ho doesn't disappoint and once again delivers a thought-provoking film with hidden truths and compelling characters.

THE FACTS: The boxes were locked to prevent theft, Postal Service officials said. Social media users are sharing photos of locked mailboxes in front of the Downtown Station post office in Burbank, California, suggesting the move is to suppress voting in upcoming elections. "Spread this far and wide! This is massive voter suppression happening in front of us! The Post Office in Burbank, CA. All outdoor boxes locked shut. The entrance to the Post Office is locked and you can't mail a letter?" the post on Facebook with the photo of the locked boxes said. A Postal Service official told the AP that anti-theft locking devices were placed on the boxes in front of the Burbank Post Office to deter mail theft. The are locked during the hours the post office is closed. "The use of Collection Box Anti-theft locking devices, such as at the Burbank Post Office, have been in place since approximately 2016 and this device was developed as a mail theft deterrent," said Evelina Ramirez, a Postal Service spokeswoman. The locks are placed on the boxes after the last collection of the day and removed at the start of then next business day. Ramirez said openings on the back of the box allow for mail to be deposited into the collection box, while the locks on the front are designed to keep mail from being removed. A video online of the locked boxes circulating on Twitter shows the letter opening on the back of the locked USPS collection boxes. The posts online come as concerns grow that the Trump administration is working to undermine the Postal Service before the election. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Sunday called Congress back into session to address concerns.

And perhaps that’s me just being a humorless scold and a wuss who doesn’t understand why people would try to die for fun. Maybe I truly do not get it, but _Class Action Park_ brings me no closer to understanding. I can enjoy the dark comedy of these horrific rides, but even that becomes a bit infuriating after a point because you’re looking at a system that’s profiting off suffering where the reality of that suffering almost becomes an afterthought. Either the consequences of these rides were dire, or they were fun anecdotes where we can laugh by virtue of survival. Action Park was a world without rules, and for _Class Action Park_ , the major takeaway seems to be some war stories with only a slight nod to the reality that people die in a war.

 The fans have been clamoring to see Mountcastle, too.

Another senior BBMP official, seeking anonymity, did not mince his words. “Bengaluru got a 0 out of 1,000 in a garbage-free city. There is no policy or direction on how to go ahead in waste management. The age old saying — Too many cooks spoil the broth — fits Bengaluru’s BBMP and its councillors. No one worked in unity and the result shows. The corporators want their say, the Commissioner wants his way and the Mayor has another direction,” he said.
