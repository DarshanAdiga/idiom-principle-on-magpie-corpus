South Central Railway (SCR), apart from moving freight trains carrying essential commodities, has also been utilising the lockdown time to complete at least a couple of key infrastructure works. Long pending ‘Scissor Junctions’ at the busy Kazipet station and the even more busier Vijayawada station, which see anywhere between 150-200 passenger trains and 50-100 freight trains pass everyday, got a much needed makeover from standard wooden sleepers to concrete ones.
 ‘Scissor junctions’ are where trains have to cross four or more lines to get into the main line during movement. Upgradation of these junctions was on the mind of the top officials for decades, but they baulked at taking up the work as it involved cancelling several trains and delaying the running of many express/freight trains as both these stations handle bulk of trains moving towards south, north, east and west, explain senior officials.
 For instance, several trains from Chennai, Bengaluru and Thiruvananthapuram towards Mumbai and Secuderabad have to pass through Kazipet junction whereas trains towards Howrah, Bhubaneshwar, Visakhapatnam and Delhi from these cities pass through the Vijayawada junction. Kazipet has comparatively lesser trains passing through it because some of them can bypass through Warangal towards Delhi or even Chennai, they informed.
 Yet, replacement was imperative as the wooden sleepers ‘were badly perished’ and the engineering wing had to carefully manage allowing the trains on these sections. “With trains running almost round the clock, the junctions improvement could not be taken up during normal times. But, we took advantage of the lockdown period, re routed some freight trains and completed the job in three days flat using less than 30 personnel,” said General Manager Gajanan Mallya. Work involved dismantling the existing wornout wooden sleepers, digging, spreading new ballast material for the cushioning and laying the new concrete sleepers as well as new steel rails.
 This was possible as the railway engineers were able to move the heavy modern machinery to lay tracks and sleepers to the site on the available free lines and complete the work in double quicktime with safety precautions, minimal manpower and social distancing. “Otherwise, it would have easily taken at least a month or more,” added Chief PRO Ch.Rakesh.

A decision on whether to allow teams to make up to five substitutions in a match will be made by the game's lawmakers by early next week at the latest.
 The PA news agency understands the International Football Association Board (IFAB) - which is made up of the four British associations and world governing body FIFA - intends to move quickly to put in place a temporary dispensation to the laws of the game.
 The idea of having additional substitutes comes after a FIFA proposal, but was something that IFAB staff had also been looking at as a way to assist teams manage the workload of players as and when football resumes amid the coronavirus pandemic.
 There were fears of an increase in injuries among footballers caused by the combination of a long layoff while competition was suspended and the demands of trying to finish the season in shortened timescales over the summer.
 If IFAB passes the dispensation, it will then be up to individual competitions such as the Premier League to decide whether they wish to implement it.
 Teams would be allowed a maximum of three slots plus the half-time interval to make the changes, to avoid unnecessary stoppages.
 The dispensation on substitutes would apply to competitions which are either due to be completed or start in 2020 or 2021, so it would also apply to the 2020-21 season.
 It will also cover all national team matches up to and including December 31, 2021.
 "When competitions resume, such competitions are likely to face a congested match calendar with a higher-than-normal frequency of matches played in consecutive weeks," a FIFA spokesperson said on Monday.
 "Safety of the players is one of FIFA's main priority then. One concern in this regard is that the higher-than-normal frequency of matches may increase the risk of potential injuries due to a resulting player overload.
 "In light of this and in light of the unique challenge faced globally in delivering competitions according to the originally foreseen calendar, FIFA proposes that a larger number of substitutions be temporarily allowed at the discretion of the relevant competition organiser."
 A number of European leagues are working towards a resumption after the COVID-19 outbreak led to a near-total shutdown of sport on the continent.
 Clubs in the top two tiers of professional football in Germany have got players back in training with a view to play starting next month.
 Italian teams will be able to resume group training on May 18.

"I am watching women every day on the street or in magazines wearing strong colors as a statement, whether wearing strong colors makes them feel fun and different or because it's simply a form of expression. But, by shooting in black and white I needed to focus more on the style, cut, textures, layers and attitude in order to prove that colors are great, but they don't say everything about the style."
