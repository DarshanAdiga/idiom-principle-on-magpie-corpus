This past Sunday, I held my breath, waiting to see what fellow white Christians would tell me about their church services. Would their white pastors speak out directly against racism, proclaim Black Lives Matter, and urge their congregants to join the uprising as white allies? What I feared—and what many of my own social media followers told me—happened. Many pastors opted to either completely ignore George Floyd’s murder (instead adhering to business as usual) or preached vague messages of peace and love. Some even threw in a MLK quote for good measure. Now white Christians have a choice to make. They know where their pastoral leadership stands. Do they stay, or do they walk away?

Eventually, after much discussion on the subject, we felt safer about soccer, but gymnastics felt like too much of a risk. Naturally, this put us in a precarious place with our children. It is always difficult to split the group like this. Whenever you sit down with your children and say that some children can do this, while others can’t -- regardless of the reasons -- the odd one out will feel picked on. So we were left to make a choice: either opt for no sports for anyone because gymnastics didn’t feel safe, or explain the situation to our children, and help our middle daughter find a new sport until gymnastics is safer.

A man who spent nearly three decades in behind bars, most of them on death row, after he was convicted at his second trial of killing a 4-year-old girl in Philadelphia was released Friday after prosecutors concluded he very likely did not do it.
 Walter Ogrod left death row and the State Correctional Institution-Phoenix hours after his charges were reduced and he was granted bail in the 1988 death of Barbara Jean Horn.
 His lawyer, James Rollins, said Ogrod's first stop would be a relative's backyard barbecue.
 “He was very pleased and relieved to be out of prison," Rollins said. “He is very tired.”
 A prosecutor apologized to Ogrod, who still faces a small chance of a third trial, at a hearing Friday.
 “I’m sorry it took 28 years for us to listen to what Barbara Jean was trying to tell us: that you are innocent, and that the words of your statement of confession came from Philadelphia Police detectives and not you,” prosecutor Carrie Wood told Ogrod, according to a news release from Wood’s office.

Some white Christians believe politics and social justice have no place in church. They prefer to sit comfortably in pews, sway to music, and hear sermons that coddle their fragility—messages that don’t rock the boat. They are quick to condemn what they believe to be wrong without every recognizing that they are, in fact, upholding white supremacy by doing nothing. They are dangerous, and they don’t even know it, oblivious that their silence is quite loud. They also believe that by sponsoring African children, using diversity stock photos on their websites, and being nice to people of color (including their “one black friend”), they are clearly not-racist. (Ahem, tokenism much?)

 Pakistan's economy was in tatters even before the emergence of coronavirus in the country, but the pandemic has added to the South Asian country's economic woes.
 Nearly 90,000 people have been tested positive for the virus, with over 1,800 related deaths. The country has recorded a huge spike in COVID-19 cases since Prime Minister Imran Khan's government lifted lockdown restrictions in mid- May.

 Khan insists the revival of the economy is more important than containing the coronavirus spread.
 "Unfortunately, the [previous] lockdown has already hit the poor people. We no longer can afford that," Khan told media in the capital Islamabad. "Therefore, except for a few sectors, all other sectors will stay open," Khan recently said, adding that the government wants to "save people from coronavirus and hunger simultaneously."
 "Coronavirus is going nowhere, at least this year. That means we have to live with it following safety guidelines," Khan said.
 But in order to revive the economy, Khan's government is shifting the onus to the private sector, which experts say could result in thousands of public job cuts.

 “I walked over and said, ‘Whoa, whoa, whoa – this don’t need to happen.'

That’s when one of the guys (claiming to be in the KKK) smacked my hands down and that’s when I drew my gun.”
 Walker said that when he pulled his pistol, one of the men went back to a truck while the other “stood there and kept on like he was going to keep going with the situation.”
 Once Walker pulled his weapon, both men left the station in their truck before police arrived, Walker said.
 Since the incident, several individuals who attended the protest have confirmed Walker’s account of events on social media.

Porsche was completely serious about putting the 989 in showrooms; the sedan wasn't an experimental design study built to turn heads on the auto show circuit before spending years in a warehouse. As one team fine-tuned the chassis, and another tweaked the design, intrepid road testers began putting the V8 through its paces in a modified Mercedes-Benz W124 test mule (shown in our gallery). This model was chosen for a couple of reasons. First, Porsche's engineers were familiar with it because they were in the process of helping create the formidable, 322-horsepower 500E. Second, it was very close to the 989 in terms of size, weight, and performance, and its engine bay was big enough to effortlessly put a V8 in. The same couldn't be said about a BMW E30.

(AP) - Forced to choose between their beliefs and their jobs, four restaurant workers say, they walked out after they were threatened with being fired for refusing to help fill an order for a law enforcement agency that was policing nearby race protests.The employees at a Columbus location of Condado Tacos, a regional Mexican chain, walked out this week over a catering order for 250 Ohio Highway Patrol officers who were working the protests of the Minnesota death of George Floyd.Now, the modest actions by just a few workers have generated national publicity that led managers to temporarily shutter two locations of the rapidly expanding chain, and have sparked a conversation about free expression in the workplace.Jake Widdowson, 25, clocked in for work Monday to learn of an order for 500 tacos for the patrol.Widdowson opposed cooperating on the order in light of the Floyd protests and told the manager so.Floyd, a black man who died while being restrained by police, has galvanized protesters of racism and police brutality across the country. The protests in Columbus have brought complaints of excessive force, including the use of tear gas and batons.“I have been participating in the protests in Columbus, and seeing the way that police have been treating peaceful protesters, it was immediately clear that it was against my principles to be complicit in that order,” Widdowson said in an interview.Store managers were supportive, Widdowson and other staff members said. Things escalated, though, when a district manager who happened to be visiting got involved, Widdowson said.“Tell anyone refusing to work that they are fired,” Widdowson quoted the district manager as saying.Widdowson and three other workers who also refused to help fill the order at the restaurant, which employs a diverse staff, left. At that point, the district manager urged them to reconsider, Widdowson said.The story made the rounds on social media as the protests happening nearby intensified. Managers closed the location the next day, along with a second store that employs a worker who tweeted a letter to managers.Condado did not fire the workers, a spokesperson said in a written statement, but staff “must understand that Condado Tacos is an inclusive business and that we will continue to serve everyone, including law enforcement.”The Highway Patrol was unaware of the walkout until a news report on it appeared the next day, said Lt. Craig Cvetan, an agency spokesperson.The patrol, he said, was “treated with nothing but kindness and respect” by the staffers who ended up filling their order. There was no patrol reaction specifically to the walkout.But state Attorney General Dave Yost, a Republican, did not stifle himself, tweeting, “I’ll miss their tacos. I’ll patronize any restaurant that posts a sign outside that says ‘Law Enforcement Welcome Here.’”The restaurant held a meeting Thursday, discussing the dust-up and staff safety following the closure of the two locations, which previously were open only for delivery and takeout because of coronavirus restrictions.The company said Friday that it plans to reopen next week.After hearing workers’ feedback, the chain hopes to donate to charities that support criminal justice and fight racism, Widdowson said.___Farnoush Amiri is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.
