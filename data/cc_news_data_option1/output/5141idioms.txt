WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal Reserve policymakers face an unusual conundrum as they meet this week: A short-term economic outlook that is worsening while the longer-term picture is brightening thanks to the emergence of coronavirus vaccines. When its meeting concludes Wednesday, the Fed could announce steps to try to offset the pandemic's increasing drag on growth. Or it could choose to mostly watch and wait, for now. This week's policy meeting coincides with a record-shattering resurgence of the coronavirus, which has caused an increase in business restrictions and made more Americans reluctant to shop, travel and dine out. Some analysts say the economy could shrink in early 2021 before recovering as vaccines combat the virus.

All of this combines to paint the T-Roc R as a seriously quick cross-country machine, at least on paper. With its standard-fit launch control engaged and Race mode selected, it can cover 0-62mph in just 4.8sec, Volkswagen claims, and it has a top speed of 155mph. So it’s easily in the same ballpark as the likes of the Cupra Ateca, Audi SQ2 and BMW X2 M35i in terms of performance, although with a base price of £40,735, the T-Roc R is pricier than its VW Group compatriots, if cheaper than the BMW.

Taking over midway through the 2016 season, Forbath proved to be as reliable as it gets at the position. He finished that season 15 for 15 on field goals, then continued his perfect streak into the following season. He also made arguably the biggest kick in franchise history to set up the Minnesota Miracle in January 2018. While pretty much everybody here remembers Case Keenum hitting Stefon Diggs for a 61-yard touchdown as time expired, they tend to forget that Forbath nailed a 53-yard field goal a couple of minutes earlier. If he misses that field goal, the Vikings lose the game. Nonetheless, the Vikings opted for youth the following offseason, getting Daniel Carlson in the fifth round of the 2018 draft. It was a classic case of thinking the grass is greener on the other side.

Alex Kozan, a 40-game starter on Auburn’s offensive line from 2013-16, offered a more blunt assessment.
 “If you don’t invest in what’s actually needed to make Auburn Football successful, you can hire as many coaches as you want and it won’t matter,” he shared on Twitter. “As things stand, the program is controlled by a small group that doesn’t have a clue what they’re doing.”
 Kozan did not elaborate, but what he said makes sense. Committing $21.45 million in buyout money to move on from Malzahn might solve one of Auburn’s biggest problems, but it won’t do anything to fix the other.
 Let’s start with what could get fixed, which is the offense. That sounds counterintuitive, given that Malzahn’s hurry-up, no-huddle system is what propelled him from Arkansas high school coach to offensive coordinator for a Cam Newton-led BCS national championship team in the span of just six years.
 But it’s also what failed him during the latter part of his tenure as head coach.
 Auburn scored 39.5 points a game behind Nick Marshall and Tre Mason during Malzahn’s best season in 2013, then 35.5 in 2014. The number never got that high again: The Tigers averaged 27.5, 31.2, 33.9, 30.9 and 33.2 points a game from 2015-19, respectively, before mustering a Malzahn-era low 25.7 during a 10-game, SEC-only schedule this season.
 That won’t cut it. Offense wins championships. The last four national title winners averaged at least 37.1 points, with last year’s historic LSU team torching defenses for 48.4 per game. The top four teams in this year’s College Football Playoff rankings are scoring at least 37.7.
 Malzahn tried to find that every which way. He turned over play-calling duties to Rhett Lashlee in 2016 and Chip Lindsey in 2017-18, took them back in 2019, then gave them away again to longtime friend and former Arkansas coach Chad Morris this season. That was supposed to be the move that elevated Auburn to the ranks of the SEC’s best. Instead, it regressed in a lot of areas.
 Maybe cleaning the slate and starting fresh is the answer. Maybe Auburn’s next coach will — or will hire someone to — get quarterback Bo Nix to realize his five-star potential. Maybe interim coach Kevin Steele or Oregon’s Mario Cristobal or Louisiana’s Billy Napier or whoever the program hires will be able to better recruit the four- and five-star offensive linemen the Tigers have been so sorely lacking.
 What that new coach will not be able to fix, though — at least, not without considerable help — is the level of financial investment Auburn is willing to make into the football program.
 Fans, maybe first and foremost, want Auburn to compete with rivals Alabama, Georgia and LSU. Those teams have combined to win each of the past six SEC championships. That’s where the Tigers strive to be.

“It’s not just Dan Bailey,” Zimmer said after the game. “We gave up a 50-yard throw because a couple guys weren’t in the right place. You can’t do that, either. If you guys want me to fire guys for making a mistake here, a mistake there, then we wouldn’t have any players. Let’s not put this all on Dan Bailey.”
 Minnesota (6-7) had chances to prove itself previously. The Vikings lost 31-30 to Tennessee (9-4) in Week 3. They lost 27-26 at Seattle (9-4) in Week 5.
 On Sunday, Minnesota led 6-0 early even though Bailey had two early misses. The young defense was holding against Tom Brady and the Buccaneers until receiver Scott Miller got behind the defense for a 48-yard touchdown reception that snapped Tampa Bay out of its early funk.
 “It definitely gives you hope and is something positive to look forward to, I guess,” Vikings linebacker Todd Davis said Monday of the team’s mistakes. “Because you know that if you correct those, you can really beat any team that you go up against. That’s a good team that we played on Sunday, but if we don’t have those self-inflicted wounds, we definitely win that game.”

 The railway opened in May 1853, serving Malton, Driffield and several villages in between.
