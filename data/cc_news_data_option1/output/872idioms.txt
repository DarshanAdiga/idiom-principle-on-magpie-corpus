Health care spending on neck and back pain has increased each year since 1996, the study found, including newer and more expensive treatments such as stem cell and plasma injections, and an increase in surgeries instead of outpatient treatment.
 The dollars don't appear to be well-spent, said Dr. Joseph Dieleman of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington's School of Medicine.
 "The big picture trend suggests that all of the spending isn't essentially leading to fewer cases," said Dieleman, lead author of the study.
 "In fact, we see that the health burden essentially hasn't changed at all over time, despite the huge increases in spending," he said. "It suggests that we have increased our spending a huge amount but we're not necessarily getting a lot more for it."
 There are ways to mitigate back and neck pain at home before it becomes a larger problem.
 It might seem counterintuitive, but staying moderately active by going for a walk can help reduce pain and prevent muscles from weakening.
 "One of the biggest misconceptions is, 'I hurt myself. I need to go on complete bed rest and lie in bed and do nothing,' " Yao said. "That's been shown to really not be effective and ideally they need to try to maintain some form of activity as much as they can, and that's been shown to have positive results."
 Eating healthier can not only reduce the inflammation that can lead to chronic back pain; it can also help someone lose excess weight, another factor of back pain.
 Chronic back pain can be emotionally straining in addition to the physical symptoms.
 To manage frustration, depression and other psychological side effects, Johns Hopkins Medicine recommends mindfulness and meditation as two nonsurgical methods for easing back pain. Taking breaks from activity when needed and being patient with yourself can prevent the condition from advancing.
 Lower back pain can stem from a range of causes, from a mild strain to a traffic accident. If pain becomes something more serious, it's important to seek additional care from a doctor instead of self-medicating, Yao said. Doctors can recommend multiple treatments including muscle relaxants, injections and physical therapy.
 Yao said the study highlights the extent to which society as a whole can improve on their muscle and joint health and ensure that patient care is at the forefront.
 "Exercise is the last thing we do, eating right is the last thing we do," Yao said. "Society as a whole is so stressed and overworked and taxed out that health becomes really on the back burner.
 "Patients have to take care of and responsibility for their own health. The more that a doctor can help facilitate that, the better."

Overall, Super Tuesday looks to be a promising day for both Sanders and Biden — perhaps especially for Biden, who just four days ago trailed one of his new surrogates, Buttigieg, in the delegate count. Warren is counting on winning broadly rather than big, and there are signs that strategy may bear fruit, although it does not appear it will be successful enough to turn her into a frontrunner overnight. Bloomberg similarly appears poised to reap some — if not a race-altering number — of delegates from his Super Tuesday strategy as well.

So guys, remember when _Lady Gaga bleached her brows_ and we absolutely _called it_ as A Thing for 2020?                          We're not one to say we told you so… but it seems Bella Hadid has hopped upon the bleach-brow hype bus. And yet again, as 100% expected, we're totally on board.                          First, a disclaimer. Bella's blonde brows _did_ make their debut at Paris Fashion Week, within the fantastical runway show of Haider Ackermann.                           ...so, possibly not a personal aesthetic choice. But from a close-zoom on her brows, it looks like Bella really took the plunge. In an instagram caption accompanying the shots of her striking look, Bella wrote:                           _"Haider is not only one of my favorite designers but one of my favorite human beings I have ever had the pleasure of working with and being around[...]thank you for trusting me with a small part of your very large vision..."_                           Serious dedication, if you ask us.                          She went on to walk the Vivienne Westwood catwalk with darker eyebrows later, which had us doubting whether she really had gone the whole hog. But on closer inspection they still look a little lighter than her usual brunette brows.                          It seems like this look works best when paired with a dramatic hair transformation. Lady Gaga's hair of choice was a slightly less drastic pastel pink, along with a glossy lip, and pastel acrylic. Bella, however, went full _District 9_ on us with a gigantic beehive and spiky micro fringe - not to mention alabaster foundation and barely-there lips.

Lyons noted his wife has been ahead of the game as she has been using reusable grocery bags for a year.                                                                                                                                                                          At Park & Shop Service Store on Front Street, customer Denise Miller was carrying her groceries in a handmade bag.                                                                                                                                                                          “I think this is a good idea,” Miller said. “I really think people should be more aware … there’s no reason we can’t get used to this. I think it is a good idea for the environment.”                                                                                                                                                                          Store Manager Jason Shaner said the program is going over well with some, while other customers were upset about it.                                                                                                                                                                          “When it comes down to it, a lot of people don’t like change,” he said. “But guess what, after two or three weeks they get used to it.”                                                                                                                                                                          Shaner said the store also sells reusable bags, but is still waiting on paper bags to be delivered to the business. He said when the paper bags arrive later this week, the store will remove its single-use plastic bags. Shaner, as well as others, questioned the use of paper bags to replace plastic bags because of the environmental issues related to cutting down trees for the bags.

I’m tired of having to pay for something that somebody else doesn’t care about — they throw (plastic out) and the rest of us get punished for it.”

ROCKY RIVER, Ohio (WOIO) - Rocky River police said Cleveland Browns running back Kareem Hunt will not be prosecuted for marijuana found during a traffic stop in January.On Jan. 21, Hunt was initially pulled over for speeding on I-90. He said he was speeding because he was trying to catch a flight.An officer searched his vehicle after he said he smelled marijuana in the car, according to police reports.“Small amounts of marijuana” were found in a backpack with Hunt’s name on it in the backseat, according to police. Police seized Hunt’s backpack, which contained the marijuana, as evidence, according to the officer.He alleged the marijuana belonged to his brother.An emotional Hunt can be heard on police dash camera video saying he “lost everything.”The police officer lectured Hunt on the importance of making better decisions, especially with how the Willoughby South High School football star made negative headlines lately.“I hate to say this, but you of anybody should know if you’re trying to stay good, stay on the right path, this is not the way to go,” the officer told Hunt.In the dashcam video released in January, Hunt said he had an open bottle of vodka in his car, but the officer said he didn’t seem impaired by alcohol, reports said.Hunt was initially cited for a minor misdemeanor traffic violation and was then sent on his way.He was not charged with any drug violations at the time.Police today said they have no plans to prosecute Hunt for the minor misdemeanor.Rocky River officials cite Ohio drug law changes and not being able to test the concentration of THC in the suspected marijuana as main reasons Hunt was not charged.Copyright 2020 WOIO.

The visit, following a request by U.K.'s Foreign Office, seeks to enhance relations following the lead of William's grandmother, Queen Elizabeth, who made a groundbreaking visit in 2011.

“We’ve been negotiating with our creditors,” said Darivoff. “We just reached a point where we felt that this (bankruptcy filing) was the way to get the best terms for the museum.”                                                                                                                                                                            The situation of the museum is not unfamiliar on the Philadelphia cultural landscape.                                                                                                                                                                            In fact, almost the exact scenario played out with the Please Touch Museum, which filed for bankruptcy in 2015. With Please Touch, the debt obligation was much larger — about $60 million.                                                                                                                                                                            It incurred the debt after moving from a small space on South 22nd Street to the dramatic, but dilapidated, city-owned Memorial Hall in Fairmount Park.                                                                                                                                                                            Please Touch could not generate the revenue to cover its operations and debt burden from extensive renovation and construction. It exited bankruptcy in 2016 with a significant debt reduction and a refocused mission.                                                                                                                                                                            Similarly, the Jewish museum was operating in a small exhibition venue on North Fourth Street, behind Congregation Mikveh Israel. But in the early 2000s, many supporters of the museum urged an expanded space and a more robust programming schedule.

But the museum broke ground anyway and opened in its radically expanded home at Fifth and Market Streets in 2010.                                                                                                                                                                            In 2012, less than two years later, The Inquirer reported that membership and visitor numbers were falling and that the museum’s initial optimistic attendance forecasts were widely off the mark. In 2017, the museum said it was eliminating 18 positions through layoffs and attrition.                                                                                                                                                                            According to Monday’s court filing, the museum now employs 25 full-time staff members and six full-time hourly workers. All are nonunion.                                                                                                                                                                            Court records describe the situation dryly: “Since opening in 2010, the museum’s revenues from gate receipts and events have not reached the levels expected.”                                                                                                                                                                            Last year, chief executive Ivy L. Barsky resigned. Misha Galperin, a New York-based financial and management consultant, has been named interim chief executive in the wake of Barsky’s departure.                                                                                                                                                                            Given such problems, Darivoff was asked if the institution regretted the move out of its manageable quarters behind Mikveh Israel into the big six-story show on Independence Mall.                                                                                                                                                                            “I don’t regret it; I applaud it,” he said.                                                                                                                                                                            “The group of people in Philadelphia who recognized the need in the American Jewish community to tell the story of Jews in America in a way that couldn’t be done in a one-room museum, I think was an act of great leadership,” Darivoff said. “Telling history is central to the Jewish people. It’s central to who we are. We are a people in part because of the way we retell our history. Our Bible is, in fact, a recitation of the history of the Jewish people. And we stay together as a community by retelling that history.”

Most sold customers paper bags if available or reusable bags to carry groceries out of the businesses.                                                                                                                                                                          Tops Friendly Market customer Monica Quigley said she is adjusting to the new rule by leaving her reusable bags on the stairs of her home so she won’t forget them on shopping trips.                                                                                                                                                                          “If that’s what is (good for the environment) then I’ll do it,” Quigley said.                                                                                                                                                                          Customer Mary Przybyla also had a reusable bag filled with groceries, adding she thought the change was good.                                                                                                                                                                          “We had no choice and it’s not that big of a deal,” Przybyla said while pausing outside. “I think it’s great for the environment, and we need to respect our environment. If people make a big deal about it, it’s just a bag.”                                                                                                                                                                          Customer Bill Bossard said the ban presented no problem for him.                                                                                                                                                                          “All you have to do is get into the rhythm of it, you have to remember to take them out of the car and bring them with you,” Bossard said with a laugh.                                                                                                                                                                          Joan Napoleon said she didn’t mind bringing her own bags, or purchasing reusable ones. She, too, hopes the new program will help the environment, as “we’re in bad shape.”                                                                                                                                                                          Tops manager Tim Lyons said he worked at the front of the West State Street store Sunday, the first day the new types of bags were used by customers.                                                                                                                                                                          “At one time I counted 50 customers come in and 48 of them had their bags on them,” Lyons said. “That’s how good it was. We’ve had no problems whatsoever. I’ve got to say the majority welcomed it with open arms.”

If you're a gamer, into virtual reality or do a lot of resource-intensive photo and video editing, you need a traditional desktop PC -- most laptops simply won't cut it. The Alienware Aurora R8 is all that and then some. I'd recommend the "200-plus FPS" edition, which has a ninth-generation Intel Core i7 9700 CPU, a GeForce 2070 Super GPU and a generous 1TB SSD, all of which clocks in at $1,880. But depending upon the size of your refund, you can customize that rig up or down.

Britains Prince William arrived in Dublin on Tuesday with his wife Kate, making a symbolic show of friendship with a close neighbor on the first official trip abroad by senior royals since Brexit. William wore a green tie and Kate a green coat and dress as they stepped off a commercial Aer Lingus flight. It was Williams first official trip to the Republic of Ireland, nearly a decade after his grandmother Queen Elizabeth made history with the first visit by a reigning British monarch.Britain left the European Union on Jan 31 after tendentious negotiations mainly held up by debate over its land border with the EU - between the Irish Republic and British-ruled Northern Ireland. The couple was to follow in Elizabeths footsteps by laying a wreath at Dublins Garden of Remembrance, which is dedicated to those who gave their lives for independence, which Ireland gained from Britain in 1921.May we never forget the lessons of history as we continue to build a brighter future together. William. Catherine, says the message on their wreath. They met Irelands President Michael D. Higgins and were due to meet Prime Minister Leo Varadkar and visit reception at the Guinness brewery, the countrys top tourist attraction.The British royal family has had an easier relationship with Ireland since the 1998 Good Friday Agreement brought an end to 30 years of conflict in Northern Ireland, where mainly Catholic Republicans sought to end British rule. Williams father Prince Charles, whose great uncle Lord Louis Mountbatten was killed in a bomb attack by the Irish Republican Army on his boat off the coast of Ireland in 1979, has made several trips to Ireland. In 2015, he shook hands with former IRA commander Martin McGuinness.Northern Ireland has been largely peaceful since the agreement, but small splinter groups continue to launch attacks against British targets and security for royal visits to Ireland remains tight.

The way to go about doing this is threefold. First, you need financial strength in a company because there will be bad times. Next, you need to pay a reasonable price for your stocks because that increases its yield. Finally, you need the business to be perennially profitable because profits, plus what a company does with those earnings, are the ultimate source of investment returns.

The committee noted that some of the factors that contributed to slowdown are non-availability of credit facility to consumers, stringent rules for loan sanction by banks, rise in price due to the upfront payment of third-party insurance for 5 years, introduction of BS-VI vehicles from April 2020; and higher rate of GST on automobiles and components. Amid slowdown in the sector, the committee, among other things, recommended to either suspend or postpone the upfront payment of insurance for 5 years for the time being and reduction in GST rate to a lower slab "at least till the revival of the auto sector".

Tornadoes careened across a swath of Tennessee overnight Monday, wrecking about 40 buildings, killing 21 people and leaving tens of thousands without electricity.

Media firm Viacom18 on Tuesday said launched a subscription-based streaming service 'Voot Select' for Indian audiences as it looks to tap into the burgeoning digital content market in the country. The service - which will compete with Netflix, Amazon Prime Video as well as offerings from Star India (Hotstar) and Zee (Zee5) - has been priced at Rs 99 a month and Rs 999 for annual subscription.                                                                                                                                                                                  "We are looking at a premium user base for Voot Select. On the back of 100 million monthly active users, we are looking at both the current subscriber base of Voot and also acquiring the premium customers who are already consuming subscription content on OTT (over the top media service)," Viacom18 Digital Ventures COO Gourav Rakshit told PTI. Voot Select is available on Android and iOS with access to 4 screen simultaneously, he added.                                                                                                                                                                                  Rakshit said VOOT is seeing usage across genres with demand for regional content growing at a fast pace. "Above 50 per cent of viewers on Voot are female. With the vast content library of Voot Select, we are targeting everyone who is looking to experience stories that are worth sharing. We are looking at the future and are confident of the overall subscriber base growing," he added.                                                                                                                                                                                  Voot's app previously was primarily advertisement-driven and contained content from its television channels. Voot Select will bring content from Viacom18's extensive portfolio of channels on the digital platform 24 hours before the episodes debut on TV. It will also house more than 30 originals, global content through partnerships with international studios, more than 1,500 Bollywood and regional language movies and stream over 35 live TV channels.                                                                                                                                                                                  "Voot is the outcome of Viacom18's vision to create a future-ready digital business catering to the evolving digital entertainment needs of every Indian. It is with this focus and a content first approach that we have built Voot Select as a premium platform providing an enhanced viewing experience for our users," he said. Online content consumption in India has seen massive growth with data plans becoming more affordable. Data rates in India are among the cheapest globally.

The purpose of this study was to estimate the potential for impaired driving performance in current drivers with diabetic peripheral neuropathy compared to healthy controls. We analysed, using a driving simulator, three important aspects of driving - use of the accelerator pedal, steering wheel and eye-steering coordination - to test for any differences, and then to integrate these findings to identify a unique pattern of changes in people driving with diabetic peripheral neuropathy. Patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy displayed differences in use of the accelerator pedal compared to healthy control drivers (p < 0.05) which could be a direct consequence of their sensorimotor impairment due to diabetic peripheral neuropathy. Drivers with DPN used the more extreme high and low positions of the pedal to a greater extent than the Control group who exhibited a more graded use of the accelerator pedal over the mid-range. Eye-steering coordination was also different in drivers with diabetic peripheral neuropathy (p < 0.05) and, as it improved during the second drive, becoming closer to healthy drivers' values, the occasional loss of control experienced during driving reduced. These insights demonstrate that diabetic peripheral neuropathy affects multiple aspects of driving performance suggesting the need for an integrated approach to evaluate the potential for driving safely in this population.

Do not wash your coloured face or hands in the sink. Touching your tap with colours hands can stain them and the colour can also stain your sink surface. Go directly to the shower and take a bath. If you have a balcony or front/back yard, try bathing over there to prevent your bathroom floor from getting stained with Holi colours.

TOKYO (CNN) - Japan’s minister for the Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games, Seiko Hashimoto, said on Tuesday that the Tokyo 2020 games “could be postponed until later this year.”She was responding to a question from an opposition party member about the possibility of postponing the 2020 Olympics during a committee meeting in Japan’s parliament.“In the contract signed by the IOC, the host city and others, it stated the IOC has the right to cancel the games only if they could not be held in 2020,” Hashimoto said. “This could be taken to mean the games could be postponed until later this year.”Talks between Tokyo’s organizing committee and the International Olympic Committee are being held this week to determine their next steps as the coronavirus continues to spread worldwide, according to the Associated Press.“The organizing committee, the IOC, and the Tokyo government are working hard on the assumption of opening the games on July 24 as scheduled. The government will put all its effort into supporting this,” Hashimoto added.According to AP, the Japanese government has indicated it sees the next couple of weeks as crucial to containing the spread of the virus.Several major sporting events in the country have already been impacted. The start of Japan’s baseball season saw teams playing in an empty Tokyo Dome while the Japan Sumo Association held a major tournament behind closed doors and without spectators due to the outbreak.The torch relay in Japan is set to start on March 26 but it could see some changes and restrictions, according to AP.Copyright 2020 CNN.

Potentially affecting all this is the fact Biden also received an endorsement from popular Texas politico and former 2020 candidate former Rep. Beto O’Rourke on Monday. How much endorsements matter has long been a question in politics, but at least one has made a difference for Biden recently: that of South Carolina Rep. Jim Clyburn, who endorsed Biden just days ahead of voting in South Carolina. An Edison Research exit poll of that state found 61 percent of voters said Clyburn’s endorsement influenced their vote, and Biden earned a resounding victory there. A similar paradigm in Texas with O’Rourke could tip the scales in Biden’s favor.

There are many tools out there that can help you draw an Entity Relationship Diagram (ER Diagram, or ERD).

Despite his dismal record on race, including helping shepherd the passage of criminal justice laws he now rails against, former Vice President Joe Biden and his pander-tastic "My Friend Barack" campaign would probably still do well among black voters, if just because of familiarity and the decades of work he's done building a campaign infrastructure within the black community.

The reporting was based on new data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) showing that in King County, the 2019 third-quarter average wage for employees in the information sector hit $5,367 per week. If you project that wage out over 52 weeks, it does indeed come to $279,000.                                                                                                                                                                            But let’s take a closer look at what that number really means.                                                                                                                                                                            First off, it’s important to understand the definition of wages used by the BLS. It isn’t merely an employee’s contract pay. It also includes one-time payouts like bonuses, stock options, severance pay, profit distributions and so on. Because of that, the BLS wage numbers can vary greatly from quarter to quarter.                                                                                                                                                                            Each year, for the information industry in King County, the third-quarter wages are significantly higher than the other quarters. That could be because bonuses are budgeted for the third quarter by these companies, according to a BLS spokesperson.                                                                                                                                                                            So, in the end, it probably wasn’t the best idea to use a third-quarter figure to project an annual average wage, as it resulted in a somewhat inflated number.                                                                                                                                                                            The year-end number, which averages out all four quarters, would be a better choice. The most recent year-end number (for 2018) is $4,233 per week. That projects out to about $220,000 per year, a drop of $59,000 from the Bloomberg calculation. Even so, it’s still an eye-popping number.                                                                                                                                                                            But there’s another issue here, and I’m sure this is one that a lot of readers noticed right off the bat: Averages.

Technical chart claims that Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (TMO) would settle between $310.33/share to $315.69/share level. However, if the stock price goes below the $294.23 mark, then the market for Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. becomes much weaker. If that happens, the stock price might even plunge as low as $283.49 for its downside target. The stock is currently in the red zone of MACD, with the indicator reading -8.12. Traders are always alerted for the move of a stock above or below the zero line due to the fact that the reading is an indicator of the position of the short-term average relative to the long-term average. If the MACD is above the zero line, then the short-term average relative is above that of the long-term average, thus implying an upward momentum. Vice versa is the case if the MACD is below the zero line.

He commended Morocco’s decision to open a new consulate in Toronto and expressed his hopes for increased partnership agreements between Morocco and the Canadian province of Ontario.                                                                                                                                                                                  “It was an enriching meeting which allowed us to discuss our future projects, but also our concerns concerning, in particular, the rising generations and the newcomers,” said Metoualli.                                                                                                                                                                                  The president of the Moroccan Jewish community of Toronto, Simon Keslassy, also had a positive view on the meeting’s outcome.                                                                                                                                                                                  He said the various actors must engage in productive discussions to “bear fruit and encourage assistance to take initiatives to contribute to development”.                                                                                                                                                                                  El Ouafi began her working visit to Canada on Friday, where she met Quebec’s Minister of Immigration, Simon Jolin Barette, in Montreal.                                                                                                                                                                                  The two officials highlighted the important role that Moroccans play in contributing to Canada’s development and agreed on signing a partnership agreement to establish an exchange program. The program aims to transfer expatriates’ potential to Moroccan sectors.                                                                                                                                                                                  Around 160,000 Moroccans live in Canada, of whom 40,000 are Moroccan Jews and 4,000 are students.

LONDON -- Do London Metal Exchange (LME) stock movements have any market significance?          There was a distant time when everyone thought so. The LME's daily stocks report was eagerly awaited for the light it shone on what was happening in the "real" physical metal markets.          If the report contained a surprise, such as a major delivery onto LME warrant, the market was collectively swift to price in the information.          That perceived relationship between LME stocks and metal prices, however, has been steadily eroded over the years as the market has learnt that movements of metal on and off exchange are more likely to be down to storage than market drivers.          The growth of a shadow LME storage network has further blurred any direct read-through from stock movements to underlying physical market dynamics.          Just occasionally, however, the LME's daily stocks report does still generate a significant price response.          Such was the case last Wednesday, Feb. 26, when the report showed 62,325 tonnes of copper "arrivals."          It was the largest single-day delivery of copper on record so the slide in the copper price after the report's release was not entirely surprising.          However, the speed of the price reaction says a lot about who is still really paying attention to LME stocks. And it isn't us humans.          "ARRIVAL" EVENTS          The "arrival" of so much metal in the LME warehouse system over the course of a single day wouldn't phase your average aluminum trader, given a long history of mega-tonnage movement in that market.          However, it was a record for copper, although not without precedent.          In fact, such copper "arrival events" have become ever more frequent over the last couple of years, large tonnages of metal turning up in the LME warehouse system over a concentrated time frame. An even larger tonnage, 74,475 tonnes, was warranted over the course of just two days in January.          These are not really "arrivals" in the true sense of the word. Such significant tonnages of metal don't just turn up at port, get unloaded, placed into an LME warehouse and warranted in a 24-hour period.          Particularly when the inflow is split across several locations as was the case with last week's copper deliveries. Metal hit the system in sizeable quantities at New Orleans (20,000 tonnes), Kaohsiung in Taiwan (12,675 tonnes), Busan in South Korea (16,675 tonnes) and Rotterdam (9,450 tonnes)          Rather, this is metal that was already sitting in an LME shed or at least in very close proximity. The "arrival" occurs when the owner presses the computer button to place the metal on LME warrant.          And the owner in this case evidently coordinated the warranting to achieve maximum market impact.          PRICE IMPACT          And whoever was behind the inflow did indeed make an impact.          It's not evident from a daily chart, which shows LME three-month copper opening and closing the day at the same price of $5,670 per tonne.          Indeed, in the rear-view chart picture the day's trading activity looks no more than a pause in a mini downtrend that saw copper slide from a Feb. 17 high of $5,828 to a Feb. 28 low of $5,533 as fears over the coronavirus spread.          However, the real action played out over a much shorter period of time.          Within a minute of the stocks report release copper had fallen by $18 per tonne with volumes on the LME's Select electronic platform spiking to 555 lots.          Even that, however, doesn't capture the full speed of the price reaction.          The stocks report was released on Refinitiv screens at 09.00.16 on that particular day and within the following second 89 lots (2,225 tonnes) traded with the price skidding from $5,666 to $5,658 per tonne.          There were clusters of trades timed around specific nanoseconds such as the 11 lots that changed hands at 09.00.17.690 and the 15 lots at 0900.17.720.          These, remember, are completed trades. The interplay of bid and offer was happening at sub-nanosecond speed, a sure sign that high-frequency trading programs were the protagonists behind the price move.          The robots, in other words, were trading the stocks report within the time it would have taken a human mind to do a fast double-take on the size of the copper inflow that day.          SUPER-FAST BUT BEHIND THE CURVE          The price reaction to last Wednesday's stocks surge underlines the extent to which robots have been programmed to respond to unusual LME stock movements.          This is not in itself surprising since robots feed on data and the LME stocks report provides one of the few daily hard data points in the base metals trading universe.          However, it does pose some interesting questions as to what is the definition of a tradeable stocks movement.          Obviously, 62,325 tonnes of arrivals, generating a net stocks increase of 61,175 tonnes is hardly a normal daily occurrence.          But in the context of the copper market over the last years it's not a black swan event either. There have been over 20 incidences of outsized copper arrivals in the LME warehouse system since the middle of 2016. Several of them have been bigger, albeit extended over two or three days.          Ask a human copper trader and the chances are that they will shrug and point to the long-running battle between two major copper players with differing views of the market. One throws metal into the system, the other cancels it and takes it out again.          The "arrival" of so much metal may indeed say something about the state of the underlying market but the message has been massaged by the entity delivering the metal.          In the case of aluminum, it's the gaming of warehouse incentives that generates much of the visible stocks movements in the LME system. What comes in and goes out says little of value about the state of the aluminum market other than that there's a lot of metal out there. Which we all know.          This is why many human metals traders have grown skeptical that LME stock movements actually mean anything.          How ironic then that the robots have yet to learn the ambiguities of the LME storage system, treating each unusual data point as a meaningful price signal.          Sure they can react faster, but they're around 10 years behind the curve in terms of what they're reacting to.          (Editing by Jane Merriman)

The U.S. Federal Reserve cut interest rates on Tuesday in an emergency move designed to shield the worlds largest economy from the impact of the coronavirus.It was the Feds first emergency rate cut since 2008 at the height of the financial crisis, underscoring how grave the central bank views the fast-evolving situation. In a statement, the central bank said it was cutting rates by a half percentage point to a target range of 1.00 to 1.25.The fundamentals of the U.S. economy remain strong. However, the coronavirus poses evolving risks to economic activity. In light of these risks and in support of achieving its maximum employment and price stability goals, the Federal Open Market Committee decided today to lower the target range for the federal funds rate, the Fed said a statement. The decision was unanimous among policymakers.In a news conference, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said the coronavirus would weigh on the U.S. economy for some time. He said he believed the central banks action would provide a meaningful boost to the economy. We saw a risk to the outlook for the economy and chose to act, Powell said. I do know that the U.S. economy is strong.. I fully expect that we will return to solid growth and a solid labor market as well.The Feds decision to cut interest rates before its next scheduled policy meeting on March 17-18 reflects the urgency with which the Fed feels it needs to act in order to prevent the possibility of a global recession. U.S. stocks initially surged on the move, which had increasingly been expected as it became evident the coronavirus would not be contained to its epicenter in China. With 90,000 cases worldwide in 77 countries and territories, the virus has upended global supply chains, triggered cancellations of sports events, business meetings and other large gatherings, and torpedoed global stock prices on fears it could cause a recession.Equities reversed many of their initial gains within minutes of the unscheduled announcement by the Federal Open Market Committee, the central banks policy arm. U.S. Treasury debt prices surged, sending bond yields lower. Interest-rate futures traders immediately began pricing in even more rate cuts in coming months. Normally, markets would welcome a rate cut, and they were hoping for it, said Peter Kenny, Founder of Kennys Commentary LLC. Now that weve got it, the question is whats next.Powell had earlier on Tuesday taken part in a conference call with the top finance authorities from the worlds seven largest economies, which concluded with a statement that they would take all appropriate measures to support the economy. At his news conference, Powell said the Fed was in active discussions with other central banks. Im a little surprised. I didnt expect that at 10 oclock today, I thought youd see something coordinated among central banks, said Justin Lederer, interest rate strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald in New York.U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin applauded the Feds decision, saying it would help the U.S. economy. In a tweet after the Fed move, President Donald Trump called on the central bank to cut even more. More easing and more cutting, he said.

Crompton Place and 90+ Cellars announced plans this week to launch Worcester's first wine garden in the courtyard at 138 Green St. in the spring. The new rose garden will open on Thursday nights from 4 to 8 p.m. beginning May 28 and running through Oct. 1. The 90+ Cellars rose truck, which has become a regular fixture of the Worcester nightlife scene, will function as the primary service bar.                                                     Once dismissed as unsophisticated by shortsighted consumers, vibrant pink wines have experienced a sharp spike in demand with the rise of social media. Over the last decade, serious wine drinkers have embraced rose, sparking a trend that industry experts predict will only continue to grow this summer. Popular merchandise featuring slogans like "rose all day" and "yes way rose" have helped align the beverage with lifestyle brands and influencers.                                                     "It's not just about coming here to drink in our garden," said owner of Crompton Collective and The Haberdash Amy Lynn Chase, "We're planning to host yoga classes, a dog adoption night, a fashion show, a cupcake pop up and other themed events." The space will feature a variety of outdoor games, local craft vendors, flexible seating and a Mija Sangria tent.                                                     Crompton Place entrepreneurs are working collectively to attract a Thursday night after-work crowd by instituting extended hours that correspond with the rose garden. "We want Thursdays to have a different vibe," said Chase. "It's going to be fresh, young and fun."                                                     Crompton Collective, Seed to Stem, Birch Ally, Alexis Grace, The Haberdash, Bedlam Book Cafe and Blue Collar Salvage will stay open until 8 p.m. on evenings when the rose garden is open. BirchTree Bread Co. has already begun serving hearth-baked pizza on Thursdays from 6 to 9 p.m. and will offer a takeout option for patrons of the rose garden once it opens this spring. Neighboring Mexican restaurant, El Patron, is also open until 9 p.m. on Thursdays for dine-in or takeout.                                                     90+ Cellars Event Marketing Manager Kelsey Lemmon is working with Chase to ensure that the rose garden is well-stocked with a wide variety of Instagrammable pink wines in addition to other offerings like Lot 50 Prosecco, Mija Sangria and two beers from Wachusett Brewery. Most wines will be priced at $8 per glass, with a limited number of $10 reserve selections. Parties of four or more will have the option of purchasing a bottle for $36.                                                     Lemmon is confident that the rose garden will serve to heighten 90+ Cellar's continued success.

During an interview with the WSJ Magazine published on Monday, Broderick noted that people have asked why the couple doesn't collaborate more on projects.

And then, we have children. There are discussions about who will be home when. And what does theater demand versus movies or television."

Elsevier, Springer and other commercial publishers have temporarily dropped their paywalls on coronavirus-related research, but they say the action is limited to the duration of the crisis and doesn’t apply to other published research.                                                                                                                                                                     “The responsible thing to do is to make all research freely available during epidemics or possibly pandemics where there are people at risk,” Edward Campion, executive editor of the New England Journal of Medicine, told the Canadian journal the Scientist.

Bloomberg) -- Sysco Corp. has approached German wholesaler Metro AG about a potential takeover, as the U.S. food distribution giant explores ways to expand in Europe, people with knowledge of the matter said.                                                                                                                                                                            Sysco has made fresh overtures to Metro in recent weeks, after first expressing interest in buying a stake last year, said the people, who asked not to be identified because talks are private. The companies are working with advisers, though discussions are at an early stage and may not lead to a transaction, the people said.                                                                                                                                                                            Shares of Metro have fallen 27% over the past year in Frankfurt, giving the company a market value of about 3.9 billion euros ($4.4 billion).                                                                                                                                                                            Any transaction would be Sysco's biggest ever and mark the first major move by Chief Executive Officer Kevin Hourican, a former top manager at CVS Health Corp., since he took the reins of the $36 billion company earlier this year. Metro would offer Sysco access to hotel, restaurant and catering clients throughout the continent.                                                                                                                                                                            Wholesale Focus                                                                                                                                                                            Sysco, the largest North American food-service distributor, has been looking to Europe for growth after a blocked attempt to buy domestic competitor US Foods Inc. in 2015. The next year, the company acquired London-based food-service distributor Brakes Group in a $3.1 billion deal to expand in Europe.                                                                                                                                                                            A representative for Metro declined to comment, while representatives for Sysco didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.                                                                                                                                                                            Metro has focused on its wholesale operations after separating from its consumer electronics arm in 2017. It also agreed last month to divest its hypermarket chain, Real. The German company reached a separate deal last year to sell control of its Chinese business to the owner of local rival Wumart Stores Inc. Those two transactions are set to bring in more than 1.5 billion euros ($1.7 billion) of net proceeds, according to a filing.                                                                                                                                                                            Czech billionaire Daniel Kretinsky in recent months has increased his stake in Metro to just below 30%. Crossing that threshold would require him to launch an offer for the rest of the company. Any suitor would need to win him over to gain full control.                                                                                                                                                                            Failed Bid                                                                                                                                                                            Kretinsky and his Slovak partner Patrik Tkac failed in their own attempt to buy out Metro last year, after their 5.8 billion-euro bid didn't get support from enough investors. Metro's management at the time opposed the deal, arguing it was highly leveraged and would restrict the company's strategic leeway.                                                                                                                                                                            While one of Metro's three founding families sold its stake to Kretinsky, the Meridian Foundation and Beisheim Group pooled their shares and said in January they had a de-facto blocking stake, with 23% of the company.                                                                                                                                                                            Kretinsky last year said he would make his next moves dependent on Metro's progress in selling its China unit and the hypermarket chain.                                                                                                                                                                            While their long-term intentions are unclear, Kretinsky and Tkac have said they see value in Metro, which runs warehouse-style cash-and-carry outlets across Germany and much of eastern Europe. Kretinsky has built a portfolio that includes energy and media assets as well as the Sparta Prague soccer team.

TOKYO (CNN) - Japan’s minister for the Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games, Seiko Hashimoto, said on Tuesday that the Tokyo 2020 games “could be postponed until later this year.”She was responding to a question from an opposition party member about the possibility of postponing the 2020 Olympics during a committee meeting in Japan’s parliament.“In the contract signed by the IOC, the host city and others, it stated the IOC has the right to cancel the games only if they could not be held in 2020,” Hashimoto said. “This could be taken to mean the games could be postponed until later this year.”Talks between Tokyo’s organizing committee and the International Olympic Committee are being held this week to determine their next steps as the coronavirus continues to spread worldwide, according to the Associated Press.“The organizing committee, the IOC, and the Tokyo government are working hard on the assumption of opening the games on July 24 as scheduled. The government will put all its effort into supporting this,” Hashimoto added.According to AP, the Japanese government has indicated it sees the next couple of weeks as crucial to containing the spread of the virus.Several major sporting events in the country have already been impacted. The start of Japan’s baseball season saw teams playing in an empty Tokyo Dome while the Japan Sumo Association held a major tournament behind closed doors and without spectators due to the outbreak.The torch relay in Japan is set to start on March 26 but it could see some changes and restrictions, according to AP.Copyright 2020 CNN.

That said, Mezzacappa herself explained that the movements of her _Cosmicomics_ suite are not really efforts to realize Calvino's narratives through music (certainly not in the spirit of Richard Strauss' attempt to turn Miguel de Cervantes' _Don Quixote_ into a tone poem). Rather, as she put it, she allowed Calvino's stories to "fully inhabit my mind for a year." That "habitation" basically "primed the pump" for her own creativity. During the Bird & Beckett concert I attended, Mezzacappa provided summaries of the the stories that led to the pieces being played that evening. Similar background material can be found on the Bandcamp Web page for the recording.

Technical chart claims that Great Panther Mining Limited (GPL) would settle between $0.5/share to $0.51/share level. However, if the stock price goes below the $0.47 mark, then the market for Great Panther Mining Limited becomes much weaker. If that happens, the stock price might even plunge as low as $0.46 for its downside target. The stock is currently in the red zone of MACD, with the indicator reading -0.06. Traders are always alerted for the move of a stock above or below the zero line due to the fact that the reading is an indicator of the position of the short-term average relative to the long-term average. If the MACD is above the zero line, then the short-term average relative is above that of the long-term average, thus implying an upward momentum. Vice versa is the case if the MACD is below the zero line.

Several major sporting events in the country have already been impacted. The start of Japan’s baseball season saw teams playing in an empty Tokyo Dome while the Japan Sumo Association held a major tournament behind closed doors and without spectators due to the outbreak.

We recently had the chance to catch up with the crew from The Hunting Public to talk turkey while at the NWTF Show in Nashville, TN. Knowing these guys are pretty much obsessed with chasing turkeys, we figured they'd be the perfect ones to ask about turkey vocalizations and the calls turkey hunters should know and use. In the video below, THP team member, Aaron Warbritton, shares what he considers the most important turkey call to master.

That journey is another excellent part of the book. The author points to the many people who say a super-intelligent AI is still far down the road. He does address that by pointing out two things. First, nobody knows how close or how far it really is. Second, major changes should be thought about in advance. That seems obvious, but so many people ignore challenges until there is no option but to address them.

Indeed, it might perversely be argued that the coronavirus has come in the nick of time; just as the global economy was beginning to show signs of stumbling, bringing the long bull market to an end, along comes a global pandemic to frighten policy makers into taking supportive action that otherwise might not have happened. By the look of it, the entire kitchen sink is to be thrown at the developing health scare.

Biden  - who nearly pulled even with Sanders in the delegate hunt thanks to a larger than expected victory in South Carolina - is aiming to prevent Sanders from capturing a large lead in the crucial battle for convention delegates. Biden's goal is to firmly cement his status as the moderate alternative to Sanders.                          He got a big boost on Sunday and Monday when two fellow centrist candidates - former South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota - suspended their own White House bids. They joined the former vice president in Dallas on Monday to formally back his presidential campaign.                           Warren, speaking in California Monday night around the same time as Biden was in Texas, said, "I want to thank Senator Klobuchar and Mayor Buttigieg for running spirited races. And I look forward to their continued service to our party and our country."                          Biden was also joined in Dallas by another former 2020 contender, former Rep. Beto O'Rourke of Texas, who formally backed the former vice president.                          Former New  York City mayor and multi-billionaire business and media mogul Mike Bloomberg is also on the ballot in the Super Tuesday states. However, unless Bloomberg scores a major delegate haul on Tuesday night, the Democratic contest will likely move increasingly toward shaping up as a two-candidate battle between Sanders and Biden.                          Still, Warren argued Monday night in California that "we find ourselves barreling toward another primary along the same lanes as 2016: one for an insider, one for an outsider. ... Democratic voters should have more choice than that."                          Warren soared last summer into early fall, joining Biden as a co-front-runner in the Democratic nomination race. But after facing increased attacks from her rivals and increased scrutiny over how she'd pay for and implement a government-run single-payer Medicare-for-all health care system, her poll numbers and fundraising figures started to slide.

The last thing Denzil Kelly Smith figured would happen to him in Vietnam was that he would fall in love. He was, after all, a member of the 3rd Battalion, 9th Marines, better known as “Shadow Warriors.”                                                                                                                                                                    The Viet Cong gave the 3/9 their nickname because the always seemed to be out there, in the shadows, waiting in ambush. Being the first battalion size unit in Vietnam, the 3/9 had to learn how adapt to jungle warfare. Through trial and error, the unit set combat precedents that would be followed by Marines throughout Vietnam. For four years, they distinguished themselves wherever they fought. Always on the move, they were involved in numerous major operations around Da Nang and the DMZ constantly engaging the enemy.                                                                                                                                                                    So for Denzil and the men of the 3/9, the prospect of finding love in the jungles of Vietnam seemed rather bleak. Then one day a letter arrived. Denzil didn’t recognize the handwriting or the name on return address. What Denzil didn’t know was that his brother, Marvin, had met a woman who worked at a bank and ask her if she knew a sweet girl who would write his brother in Vietnam. She did. Her name was Patricia “Patty” Kissel.                                                                                                                                                                    This stranger’s kind words touched Denzil and he immediately wrote her back. Soon came Patty’s reply, this time with baked goods. For a year letters flew back and forth, each one drawing them closer. In 1969, Denzil finally got his orders home and the first time he set eyes on Patty, he knew she was the one.                                                                                                                                                                    Being the youngest of eight children, Denzil was the “baby” of the tight-knit group with his older siblings always looking out for him. They didn’t agree with his decision to return to Vietnam for a second tour and tried to talk him out of it. He explained it was his duty to be with his outfit and return he did, but not before Patty said she would wait for him.                                                                                                                                                                    Somehow he survived his second tour and on June 27, 1970, Denzil and Patty were married. The happy couple went on to have four children and 12 grandchildren. They devoted their lives to God and their church where Denzil was a Sunday School Superintendent and played the bass guitar. They settled near Omaha, some years back on a 25-acre spread spending their evenings peacefully holding hands and enjoying the splendor of the Ozarks.                                                                                                                                                                    Denzil continued serving his country as a Service Officer with the Disabled American Veterans. He was always there for veterans in need. His brothers at the DAV described Denzil as a straight talker with a huge heart. A man to be admired and looked up to. A true Marine with honor and dignity. A friend with a kind smile and good humor. Sadly, we lost Denzil a couple weeks ago after a long illness.                                                                                                                                                                    At Denzil’s service, his DAV brothers showed up to pay our respects and attempt to provide what little comfort we could to his family. The opposite happened. His family comforted us and made us feel welcome and appreciated. Patty made sure to give each one of us a big hug. Her charm and kindness were apparent. It was easy to see why she had captured Denzil’s heart so quickly. We swapped funny stories about Denzil, laughing as he would want us to.                                                                                                                                                                    Somehow, in the midst of the horrors of war, a beautiful love story took root that lasted for 49 years. This love continues on in the hearts of Patty, their children and grandchildren.

Perhaps surprisingly, it was the lower-ranked Paquet who began more confidently. Bidding for her fifth career Top 50 win, and fourth in the past year, the 25-year-old slammed down-the-line winners off each wing to capture the first two games, and thereafter dominated an opening act in which Mladenovic remained all at sea.

But even if other regional states made no new investments in education funding during the past two years, they still would exceed Oklahoma’s student expenditure.                                                                                                                                                                    Oklahoma would need to invest about $600 million more annually to reach the 2016-17 average of Missouri, Kansas, Arkansas, New Mexico, Colorado and Texas, said Shawn Hime, executive director of the Oklahoma State School Boards Association. That figure does not account for state or local funding increases for this school year or enrollment increases.                                                                                                                                                                    Nationally, Oklahoma ranked behind every state except Utah and Idaho in 2016-17 and would pass only four states in 2018-19 if nobody else increased their investments.                                                                                                                                                                    “Other states aren’t standing still when it comes to investment in children, and neither should Oklahoma,” Hime said. “This report is a reminder to policymakers what educators and families already know: Ongoing, new education investment is critical. State investments and a strong economy have helped schools tremendously the last few years. We know we’re on a path to continue narrowing the gap and better supporting children and teachers if we stay the course. Our children need us to continue to invest with the urgency that we have shown the last two years.”                                                                                                                                                                    Hime said the funding gap means Oklahoma students face a daily lack of resources available to children in other states. He believes additional support is needed for schools to further increase compensation packages to combat the teacher shortage, reduce class sizes, restore extracurricular activities, hire more counselors and offer more social, emotional and health supports for students.                                                                                                                                                                    In 2018, Oklahoma needed to hire about 4,000 more teachers to reach the average regional student-to-teacher ratio, according to the National Center for Education Statistics.

Here’s the somewhat confusing history. When Obamacare was originally enacted, the individual mandate was seen as a crucial element of the law. If people were not required to buy insurance when they were healthy — or if the requirement were not backed up by a big enough penalty — they would be tempted to wait until after they got sick and started racking up medical bills, and only then ask an insurance company to pick up the tab. This behavior drives up premiums and can lead to a “death spiral”; insurers no longer had any power to stop it themselves, because the law banned them from discriminating against people with pre-existing conditions.

The IAEA has finally grown a backbone and yet both Israel and Iran seem to have reached a quiet ceasefire over the nuclear standoff.                                                                                                                                                                                  On Tuesday, the IAEA reported for the first time that Iran has far exceeded the low enriched uranium threshold for a nuclear bomb.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     The threshold is 1,000 kilograms of enriched uranium and the IAEA confirmed that the Islamic Republic has enriched over 1,500 kilograms.                                                                                                                                                                                  In addition, the IAEA's relatively new chief Rafael Grossi told AFP on Tuesday: "Iran must decide to cooperate in a clearer manner with the agency to give the necessary clarifications."                                                                                                                                                                                  "The fact that we found traces (of uranium) is very important. That means there is the possibility of nuclear activities and material that are not under international supervision and about which we know not the origin or the intent.                                                                                                                                                                                  "That worries me," Grossi added.                                                                                                                                                                                  Those are fighting words coming from the normally "no drama" IAEA.                                                                                                                                                                                  Grossi's predecessor, Yukiya Amano, did all he could to avoid public conflict with Tehran, no matter what new problematic facts came to his desk.                                                                                                                                                                                  A Reuters report also said that Grossi would confront the Islamic Republic over multiple undeclared sites that his inspectors were being denied access to.                                                                                                                                                                                  And yet, both Israel and Iran so far are silent. Neither the prime minister's office for the foreign ministry indicated they would be issuing an immediate response.                                                                                                                                                                                  Iranian news outlets merely carried the IAEA's report about its exceeding the nuclear threshold and the 300 kilogram limit by a magnitude of five with little commentary or counterargument.                                                                                                                                                                                  For several months, the IAEA has been pressing Iran for explanations about undeclared nuclear material that it found around February 2019. The nuclear material was announced by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in September 2018 as having been found by the Mossad.                                                                                                                                                                                  That announcement came after Netanyahu's April 2018 announcement that the Mossad had appropriated tens of thousands of Iran's secret nuclear files.                                                                                                                                                                                  It is those files which, sources close to Mossad Director Yossi Cohen have told the Jerusalem Post, provided a map of undeclared Iranian nuclear sites - some of which now the IAEA is clearly trying to confront Tehran about.                                                                                                                                                                                  So why is Israel silent?                                                                                                                                                                                  One reason is it may be embarrassed.                                                                                                                                                                                  IDF Chief-of-Staff Aviv Kochavi on January 14 said that Iran would not reach this point until January 2021. Ooops.                                                                                                                                                                                  Former IAEA official Olli Heinonen had predicted a much earlier date in an interview with the Post on January 7 and appears to have been closer to how things played out.                                                                                                                                                                                  Another reason is that Iran has kept its uranium enrichment around the 4.5% level. As long as the Islamic Republic stays away from the medium 20% level, let alone the 90% weaponization level, there is no immediate crisis.                                                                                                                                                                                  Prior to the 2015 nuclear deal, Iran had enough low enriched uranium for over 10 nuclear weapons, and the world lived with it since Tehran did not move to much toward higher levels of enrichment.                                                                                                                                                                                  This may be the same reason that Iran is staying quiet.                                                                                                                                                                                  With all of its violations and noise, it is actually maintaining a careful conservative strategy which will not unduly provoke Israel (and maybe even the US) into a preemptive strike.                                                                                                                                                                                  Still, there is no question that Iran may have cut its breakout time from 12 months to 6 months or even less.                                                                                                                                                                                  Will the IAEA get answers from Iran? Probably not. At the end of the day, the IAEA's tougher tone is welcome and helpful, but the real keys to breaking the deadlock are in the hands of the EU-3, China and Russia.                                                                                                                                                                                  The EU-3 recently made it clear that they will not follow through with their threat to snap back full UN global sanctions on Iran as long as Tehran does not move to higher levels of enriched uranium or kick out inspectors.                                                                                                                                                                                  Incomplete cooperation with the IAEA probably will not lead the EU-3 to pulling the trigger without a new smoking gun that Iran is clandestinely trying to breakout as opposed to clandestinely perform some non-committal off-books nuclear-related tests.                                                                                                                                                                                  And so the awkward Israeli-Iranian nuclear ceasefire has brought an even awkward moment in which the normally quiet IAEA is being loud and the main players in this story are broadcasting deafening silence.

Have you ever wondered what it would be like to be an ordinary person in a Cyberpunk world? Well, Cloudpunk lets you experience just that by putting you in the shoes of a courier for the Cloudpunk delivery service in a "wide-spanning open world," and you can watch the first ten minutes of the game in our PAX East showcase.                                                                                                                                                                                  As Cloudpunk's Craig Bleasdale explains in the video above, "It's an open-world, story-drive narrative adventure. You play as a courier driver for a semi-illegal delivery company and it's your first night on the job."                                                                                                                                                                                   Taking place over the course of one night, as a narrative-driven experience, you can decide what you want to do with your deliveries and every choice you make will have consequences throughout the story and affect how characters react to you.                                                                                                                                                                                   With a strong neon-tinted aesthetic that's become synonymous with cyberpunk, Bleasedale cites Bladerunner and Fifth Element as points of inspiration, as well as narrative focused games like Kentucky Route Zero and Firewatch.                                                                                                                                                                                   Interestingly, you won't just be driving your vehicle the entire time, though. Because it's story-driven, Cloudpunk puts a big focus on the characters who inhabit its world. Half of the game will take place on foot, with plenty of side quests to keep you busy to boot. There are 30-40 different characters you'll be able to meet out in the world, and it's up to you to decide how you'll interact with them.                                                                                                                                                                                   But of course, you'll be spending a lot of time in your futuristic-esque vehicle, which can be damaged as you travel around. If you're not careful it won't run either, and you'll have to make sure you keep fueled up as you go about your deliveries. Outside of keeping it in tip-top shape, you'll have plenty of customisation options to play around with, too.                                                                                                                                                                                   Cloudpunk is currently set to release sometime in 2020 on PC, Xbox One, PS4, and Switch, but until then, be sure to check out the above gameplay and enjoy some delivery-based action.

Emerging markets stocks and currencies rose on Tuesday after the U.S. Federal Reserve cut interest rates in an emergency move to combat the impact of the coronavirus outbreak, raising hopes for other central banks around the world to follow suit.The U.S. central bank said it was cutting rates by half a percentage point to a target range of 1.00 to 1.25, shortly after a statement from G7 financial officials earlier in the day failed to detail concrete measures to help economies stabilize from damage caused by a fast-spreading coronavirus outbreak. Clearly the Fed is alarmed by the risks posed directly by the coronavirus, but also indirectly via the panic that took hold of financial markets last week, said James McCann, senior global economist at Aberdeen Standard Investments.This step should provide some comfort to markets, boost borrowers and help support confidence. The surprise move sent the U.S. dollar to a fresh six-week low, before paring losses and helped MSCIs index for emerging market currencies gain 0.4, while its Latin American counterpart rose 0.8.A basket of emerging market stocks rose 1.4. Turkeys lira outperformed its peers with a 1.5 jump to 6.0268 against the greenback, briefly touching its strongest level in nearly three weeks.The Turkish lira was one of the worst performing currencies last week, so investors are clearly happy with the stimulus measures being brought forward, said Jason Tuvey, senior emerging markets economist at Capital Economics. Turkish stocks also led gainers with its 3.6 jump, among equities in the emerging markets space, while Argentine stocks led gains among Latin American equities.South Africas rand also firmed against the dollar, reversing losses from earlier in the day which were triggered by data that showed Africas most industrialized economy entered its second recession in two years in the final quarter of last year. Russias rouble added to gains after the rate decision by the Fed as well as being boosted by a recovery in oil prices.For GRAPHIC on emerging market FX performance in 2020, see httptmsnrt.rs2egbfVh For GRAPHIC on MSCI emerging index performance in 2020, see httpstmsnrt.rs2OusNdX For TOP NEWS across emerging marketsFor CENTRAL EUROPE market report, see For TURKISH market report, seeFor RUSSIAN market report, see

RB Leipzig have found a clever way around the ruling as they have just 17 members, all of whom are employees of Red Bull, while Hopp was given an exemption to purchase more than 50% of Hoffenheim as he has been an large-scale investor in the club for more than 20 years.

From tackling the root causes of migration to fighting human trafficking: The EU has many different goals for its migration policy. On paper they are sold as equal. Financially, they are not, as DW data analysis shows. (15.02.2018)

BRUSSELS -- European Union ambassadors voiced outrage at a meeting this week over what they see as an attempt by Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan to "blackmail" the bloc by allowing migrants to mass at Greece's border, diplomatic sources said.                                                                                                                                                                                  Some envoys conceded, however, that Erdogan has the EU in a bind because its member states cannot agree how to deal with refugees and - to avoid a replay of the 2015/16 migration crisis - believe the bloc will have to cough up more money for Turkey to go on keeping a lid on arrivals in Europe.                                                                                                                                                                                  "The EU is the target of a blackmail," one diplomat told Monday's closed-door meeting in Brussels, details of which were relayed to Reuters by multiple diplomatic sources.                                                                                                                                                                                  The EU has struggled to respond as thousands of migrants have arrived at Greece's border from Turkey in recent days. Its ties with Ankara are already strained over security and human rights, as well as Turkish hydrocarbon drilling off Cyprus.                                                                                                                                                                                  In 2015/16 the chaotic arrival of more than a million people from the Middle East stretched the bloc's security and welfare systems and fueled political support for far-right groups.                                                                                                                                                                                  The EU sealed a deal with Turkey in March 2016 under which Ankara stopped people on its soil from heading to Europe. In exchange, the bloc offered 6 billion euros in aid for the more than 3.5 million Syrian refugees Turkey is hosting.                                                                                                                                                                                  But Erdogan has long complained that the money is slow to come and channeled through aid groups, not Turkey's budget. After Russian-backed Syrian government forces killed Turkish soldiers in an air strike in Syria last week, Ankara signaled it would walk away from its pact with the EU altogether.                                                                                                                                                                                  "You sleep with the devil, you wake up in hell - there is where we are now," one ambassador said during the meeting.                                                                                                                                                                                  Compounding the EU's dilemma are internal divisions over how to distribute the burden of caring for refugees and migrants arriving in the 27-nation bloc.                                                                                                                                                                                  One senior EU diplomat said the EU had squandered the time since the 2016 deal, brushing the problem under the carpet by paying for refugees and migrants to be kept in Turkey.                                                                                                                                                                                  Representatives of the Netherlands, Italy, France and Germany were among those who proposed giving more funds to help refugees in Turkey in the hope of appeasing Erdogan.                                                                                                                                                                                  At the same time, "as much as it is logical for the EU to continue supporting Syrian refugees in Turkey, it is important not to create the impression of giving in to blackmail," one of the diplomats said, according to the sources.                                                                                                                                                                                  During a visit on Tuesday to a Turkish-Greek border crossing that thousands of migrants have been trying to breach, EU officials promised more cash to Greece to deal with the crisis.

Several diplomats warned of a repeat of the 2015/16 chaos, which brought more eurosceptic and anti-immigration politicians to the forefront in Europe, saw EU countries slap border controls in what is normally the bloc's zone of free travel, and sowed bitter divisions between member states, damaging EU unity.                                                                                                                                                                                  These feuds led the EU to eventually outsource migration management to Turkey, despite heavy criticism from rights groups that the scheme aggravates the suffering of already distressed people by leaving them in grim circumstances there.                                                                                                                                                                                  Of the 6 billion euros promised, the EU's executive European Commission said on Tuesday that 2.2 billion had already been disbursed and the rest was assigned to specific projects, meaning they should reach beneficiaries soon.                                                                                                                                                                                  The EU has not yet discussed numbers for further funding and diplomats said any decision to step up financing could be deferred to the bloc's leaders, due to meet in Brussels on March 26-27.                                                                                                                                                                                  In the meantime, the EU may step up humanitarian aid to Syria's northwestern region of Idlib, one of the last places held by Turkish-backed rebels facing off against Damascus.                                                                                                                                                                                  It is also offering Ankara - a NATO ally of most EU members - words of support over the conflict in Syria and raising political pressure on Erdogan to honor the 2016 deal.                                                                                                                                                                                  "It is so dishonest of Erdogan. We cannot let ourselves be blackmailed so any new money must not come too soon. But we will probably have to pay eventually. What else can we do?" a fourth diplomat told Reuters.

At the federal level, a public health emergency gives the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) more flexibility to help states respond to a threat. If necessary, it also lets HHS suspend or modify some laws, like parts of the HIPAA privacy rule or laws requiring that medications only be given out in health care facilities.

In the black hole of bad news for diet soda lovers, there's a tiny glimmer of light.
 The gloom set in when science showed drinking diet soda could lead to metabolic syndrome, a nasty mix of higher blood pressure and blood sugars that leads to weight gain and increases the risk of diabetes, heart disease and stroke.
 But a new study has found that it's when you pair the common artificial sweetener sucralose with a carbohydrate -- not the sweetener alone -- that the body's metabolism changes in a way that can lead to metabolic syndrome.

In Haugesund, southern Norway, a German cruise ship with 1,200 passengers was blocked overnight while awaiting the results of two passengers tested for the virus, Norwegian broadcaster NRK said. The Aida Aura was supposed to leave Monday but was still in Haugesund on Tuesday and passengers were being kept on board. The ship's operator later said the two German passengers tested negative and the ship hoped to be underway soon.

Any change to dates would instantly wreak havoc on most sports programmes, with competition calendars planned several years ago to accommodate the Tokyo timings. Finding a new date in 2020 at this stage, which would firstly need the green light from the IOC, would be extremely difficult, if not impossible, for the 33 sports federations present in Tokyo.

It’s probably unlikely that Hyundai will make a road version of the Prophecy considering all the talk about how the concept car sets up the design language for the company’s many forthcoming electric and hybrid vehicles. That doesn’t mean it’s completely out of the question, though. Should something like the Prophecy ever come to market, here’s hoping Hyundai drops some of Rimac’s tech into the final version. What better way for the Korean automaker to recoup some of the $90 million it dropped on the boutique Croatian supercar company last year than to make an electric 911 / Model 3 mashup that’s just as fast — or maybe even faster — as the real thing?

Previous research has demonstrated that the distraction caused by holding a mobile telephone conversation is not limited to the period of the actual conversation (Haigney, 1995; Redelmeier & Tibshirani, 1997; Savage et al., 2013). In a prior study we identified potential eye movement and EEG markers of cognitive distraction during driving hazard perception. However the extent to which these markers are affected by the demands of the hazard perception task are unclear. Therefore in the current study we assessed the effects of secondary cognitive task demand on eye movement and EEG metrics separately for periods prior to, during and after the hazard was visible. We found that when no hazard was present (prior and post hazard windows), distraction resulted in changes to various elements of saccadic eye movements. However, when the target was present, distraction did not affect eye movements. We have previously found evidence that distraction resulted in an overall decrease in theta band output at occipital sites of the brain. This was interpreted as evidence that distraction results in a reduction in visual processing. The current study confirmed this by examining the effects of distraction on the lambda response component of subjects eye fixation related potentials (EFRPs). Furthermore, we demonstrated that although detections of hazards were not affected by distraction, both eye movement and EEG metrics prior to the onset of the hazard were sensitive to changes in cognitive workload. This suggests that changes to specific aspects of the saccadic eye movement system could act as unobtrusive markers of distraction even prior to a breakdown in driving performance.

The oil prices have a major bearing on how consumers such as India manage inflationary and fiscal pressures. Weighed by a decline in the manufacturing sector, India’s factory output contracted in December while retail inflation accelerated for the sixth consecutive month in January, raising doubts on the recovery process of the fledgling Indian economy. India’s economic growth is estimated by the National Statistical Office to hit an 11-year low of 5% in 2019-20 on the back of sluggish consumption and investment demand.

GENOA (UrduPoint News / Sputnik - 03rd March, 2020) Syrian opposition figures told Sputnik they believe that the presidents of Russia and Turkey during their upcoming talks are likely to agree on creating a safe zone in Syria's north to facilitate the return of Syrian refugees, as well as on modifying the bilateral Sochi agreement on the demilitarization of Syria's Idlib province.          Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Turkish counterpart, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, will discuss the settlement in Syria in light of the recent escalation in Idlib on Thursday in Moscow, the Kremlin's press service said on Tuesday. Fighting in Idlib escalated last week after jihadists launched an operation against Syrian government troops, prompting retaliatory attacks, after which the Turkish military said that more than 30 service members had been killed by the Syrian forces. The Russian Defense Ministry said that the Turkish military members, who were among the terrorists for an unknown reason, had become caught up in the attack. Several rounds of talks between the Russian and Turkish delegations to settle the situation in Idlib have been held, but no agreement was reached.          "They can agree on creating a safe zone along the border with Turkey, 25 kilometers [15.6 miles] deep, to facilitate the return of refugees," Mahmoud Afandi, the secretary of Syrian opposition movement Popular Diplomacy, told Sputnik.          The situation in Idlib has led to a fresh influx of migrants to the European Union. As tensions between the Turkish and Syrian militaries were escalating, Erdogan announced last Saturday that Turkey would no longer be able to restrain the flows of migrants and refugees, and opened its border with the bloc. Since the announcement, thousands of migrants have been blocked at the border.          Top EU diplomat Josep Borrell and Crisis Management Commissioner Janez Lenarсic are traveling to Ankara on Tuesday to discuss Idlib and the refugee situation.          Ayham Ghazzi, a member of the opposition Syrian Negotiation Commission, suggested that Turkey had "a green light to go inside Syria," noting that Ankara would try to establish a demilitarized zone in the north of the country and drive migrants there.          "The Turks will push some of the refugees there because they need this card in bargaining with the western countries," Ghazzi told Sputnik.          Dima Moussa, the vice-president of the opposition Syrian National Coalition and a Syrian constitutional committee member, told Sputnik that the idea of creating the safe zone in Syria along the border with Turkey had previously been discussed but lacked momentum for being implemented.          "While on the short-term, it might be an option to provide safe space to the [internally displaced persons] in Syria and refugees who might choose to come back. It is not a long-term solution, as this would mean squeezing millions into a small strip that does not have the proper infrastructure to contain the massive number of people," Moussa argued.

Tricking payphones was an art form, to say the least. It was not only a staple of mid-1990s payphone usage, but carried a certain status among your peers. You were a hacker, subverting the system, damning the man. While we might have felt we invented ways to "hack" payphones to give us free calls, we were not in any way the first to cheat the system, something that is nearly impossible to do with cell phones (as well as generally unnecessary).

Nicosia, (APP - UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 3rd Mar, 2020 ) :Cyprus' president said Tuesday his country fears a migratory influx after Ankara allowed refugees to leave for the European Union and people massed on the Turkish-Greek border.           The Mediterranean island of Cyprus is split between the Republic of Cyprus, an EU member state, and a breakaway Turkish entity in the north, recognised only by Ankara.           "With what is happening at the Greek border with the migrant flows from Turkey, and Cyprus being first in the number of asylum seekers... (relative to) population... we are certainly concerned," Republic of Cyprus President Nicos Anastasiades told reporters.           "We want to evaluate what steps we can take so that, without bypassing human suffering... we will be able to prevent efforts to alter the demographic character of the country," he added.           Ankara gave a green light for refugees to head to the EU on Friday, sparking thousands to mass at the Greek border.           Turkey hosts some four million refugees and faces another huge influx from the civil war in Syria, where the regime -- backed by Russian air power -- is pressing a violent offensive to retake the last rebel-held province of Idlib.           But European leaders have insisted Turkey abide by a 2016 deal that saw Ankara agree to stop migrant departures to the EU in exchange for six billion Euros in assistance.

McMichael, the Dilworth, Paxson bankruptcy attorney who handled the Philadelphia Orchestra bankruptcy a few years ago and is representing the Jewish museum, said he wanted to get the museum in and out of bankruptcy court as quickly as possible, about six months.                                                                                                                                                                            “The museum has more debt than it can sustain,” McMichael said. “And that has a lot of negative implications for a nonprofit. It’s really no different than other nonprofits I’ve taken through Chapter 11 in Philadelphia, in the sense that what happens when a nonprofit has more debt than they can reasonably ever repay, donors start to get cold feet and they back off of it.”                                                                                                                                                                            That, he said, fuels “a proverbially vicious cycle, and the only way to deal with it, ultimately, is to resolve things through a Chapter 11. That’s what Chapter 11 is there to do.”                                                                                                                                                                            The museum is known for its unusual, sometimes quirky, exhibitions, everything from a big overview of Leonard Bernstein in 2018 to Ruth Bader Ginsburg and “Sara Berman’s Closet” in 2019.                                                                                                                                                                            In essence, the filing places the museum under court protection, holding creditors at bay while at the same time negotiating a financial and operating plan. At the end, McMichael noted, the bondholders will walk away with some portion of their principal; the museum will walk away with its existence and reduced debt obligations.                                                                                                                                                                            Fundraising for the museum hit a recent high of $7.4 million in fiscal 2017, according to audited financial statements. That fell to $5.9 million in 2018 and an unaudited $4.8 million in 2019. Total revenue has fallen from a recent high of $9.4 million in 2017 to $6.3 million in 2019. Attendance has followed a similar path. In 2017 it hit 108,745; by 2019 it had dropped to 82,950.                                                                                                                                                                            Darivoff said that the museum has been paying about 20% of its budget in interest payments every year. The decision to file for bankruptcy was prompted by the expectation that it would lead to “a reduction in debt that will create a new level of sustainability.”                                                                                                                                                                            “Our budget is around seven-and-a-half to $8 million, and we have $30 million of debt, and that is just too huge a number and we have to deal with that,” he said. “The entire board is with this plan. We feel this is something we must do.”                                                                                                                                                                            What has particularly focused the attention of the board, Darivoff said, is the fact that a large balloon payment looms. In July 2022, the $16 million-plus bond held by the Bridgehampton National Bank will come due.                                                                                                                                                                            The museum has been negotiating with the bank to restructure the bond payments, but those talks have been fruitless. In August of last year, the museum did not pay the interest obligation on the bonds, according to court records. The bank countered with a demand for immediate repayment of the full amount.                                                                                                                                                                            No payment has been forthcoming, putting the museum in default.

An adult use cannabis company hoping to open a Worcester location has come under fire for actions the United Food and Commercial Workers Union says are attempts to block unionization efforts.                          Last week, the Local 1445 branch of the UFCW filed a complaint against Mayflower Medicinals for issuing written warnings to two workers involved in an effort to unionize staff at a Holliston cultivation facility, as well as spreading anti-union messaging.                          "These types of companies are making millions of dollars and they should be sharing it with their employees," said Richard Poole, representative of the UFCW local. "These aren't run of the mill employees, they come from the culture and they believe in it and they want the company to succeed."                          Mayflower Medicinals, which already operates in Holliston and Boston, has full city approval to open a retail location at 645 Park Ave. Both the License Commission and the Planning Board approved the proposal in the fall. But the company has not yet received final approval from the Cannabis Control Commission. A request for comment from the commission on the new anti-union allegations went unanswered as of press time.                          For months, workers at Mayflower facilities in Boston and Holliston have been organizing to join the Local 1445 union. Recently, the management has come down on two employees active in the unionization effort for infractions the union said does not typically require punishment. Further, documents provided to Worcester Magazine by the union appear to show a letter circulated by the company dissuading employees from joining the unionization effort.                          "You may be approached by a paid union organizer or one of your coworkers that is in favor of organizing a union," the letter reads. "The union organizers may ask you to sign a 'union authorization card.' Signing these cards has serious consequences."                          The letter goes on to warn employees that union membership means "you could be put on trial or fined" for failing to follow union bylaws, and that, via collective bargaining, "you could get the same, or you could get less."                          In the two-page letter's closing note, the company writes, "We support our employees and respect their rights to make informed decisions about their employment. Therefore, we encourage each of you to obtain answers to the important questions above before making any commitments."                                                        For the union, this letter, and the two disciplinary actions, constitute illegal interference in unionizing efforts.                          "It tells us that the company in this situation is not allowing the employees to choose, which is the law," said Poole, representative of the Local 1445. A majority of the statements made by the company in the letter are "framed in a way that is quite frankly incorrect."                          Mayflower Medicinals did not respond to a request for comment, but a spokesperson for iAnthus Capital Holdings, the parent company, told the Boston Globe last week that Mayflower employees "will have the opportunity to decide whether they want union representation" in what the paper described as a brief statement.                          Poole said he feels the new allegations should give both the city and the CCC pause about doing business with the company.                          "I think Worcester is a union town," he said. "I believe that if you have a dispensary that is going to be moving into Worcester, then you should really look at things like, are they actively funding an anti-union campaign?"                          The UFCW has been working aggressively to unionize workers in the nascent cannabis industry throughout the country. They currently represent more than 10,000 workers in 15 states. Last year, the union organized more than 100 workers at Sira Naturals, a Milford-based cannabis company. Workers at Mayflower Medicinals were inspired by the effort at Sira to launch their own campaign, Poole said.                          The complaint went to the state Department of Labor Relations Board, but has not yet been heard. Poole said he doesn't expect harsh punishment for the company, but hopes a ruling will stop Mayflower from actively working against unionization efforts.

Why are Bundesliga fans protesting against Hopp?                                                                                                                                                                                  Unlike the vast majority of clubs which follow the 50+1 rule which ensures that fans retain ownership of clubs, Hoffenheim is 96 per cent owned by Hopp. As a result, he has been able to use his huge financial clout to help the club turn from unknown amateurs into a top-flight team capable of qualifying for Europe. Hoffenheim qualified for the Champions League in 2018 under the guidance of head coach Julian Nagelsmann.

WASHINGTON -- The U.S. Federal Reserve cut interest rates on Tuesday in an emergency move designed to shield the world's largest economy from the impact of the coronavirus.          It was the Fed's first emergency rate cut since 2008 at the height of the financial crisis, underscoring how grave the central bank views the fast-evolving situation.          In a statement, the central bank said it was cutting rates by a half percentage point to a target range of 1.00% to 1.25%.          "The fundamentals of the U.S. economy remain strong. However, the coronavirus poses evolving risks to economic activity. In light of these risks and in support of achieving its maximum employment and price stability goals, the Federal Open Market Committee decided today to lower the target range for the federal funds rate," the Fed said a statement.          The decision was unanimous among policymakers.          In a news conference, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said the coronavirus would weigh on the U.S. economy for some time. He said he believed the central bank's action would provide "a meaningful boost to the economy."          "We saw a risk to the outlook for the economy and chose to act," Powell said.  "I do know that the U.S. economy is strong.. I fully expect that we will return to solid growth and a solid labor market as well."          The Fed's decision to cut interest rates before its next scheduled policy meeting on March 17-18 reflects the urgency with which the Fed feels it needs to act in order to prevent the possibility of a global recession.          U.S. stocks initially surged on the move, which had increasingly been expected as it became evident the coronavirus would not be contained to its epicenter in China. With 90,000 cases worldwide in 77 countries and territories, the virus has upended global supply chains, triggered cancellations of sports events, business meetings and other large gatherings, and torpedoed global stock prices on fears it could cause a recession.          Equities reversed many of their initial gains within minutes of the unscheduled announcement by the Federal Open Market Committee, the central bank's policy arm. U.S. Treasury debt prices surged, sending bond yields lower. Interest-rate futures traders immediately began pricing in even more rate cuts in coming months.          "Normally, markets would welcome a rate cut, and they were hoping for it," said Peter Kenny, Founder of Kenny's Commentary LLC. "Now that we've got it, the question is what's next."          Powell had earlier on Tuesday taken part in a conference call with the top finance authorities from the world's seven largest economies, which concluded with a statement that they would take all appropriate measures to support the economy. At his news conference, Powell said the Fed was in active discussions with other central banks.          "I'm a little surprised. I didn't expect that at 10 o'clock today, I thought you'd see something coordinated among central banks," said Justin Lederer, interest rate strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald in New York.          U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin applauded the Fed's decision, saying it would help the U.S. economy. In a tweet after the Fed move, President Donald Trump called on the central bank to cut even more. "More easing and more cutting," he said.

The company’s net interest income has witnessed growth every year since the financial crisis with support from rising earning assets. It recorded a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of nearly 9.8% over the last five years (ended 2019). We expect growth in interest income in the near term as well, on the back of a decent lending scenario.

Previous research has demonstrated that the distraction caused by holding a mobile telephone conversation is not limited to the period of the actual conversation (Haigney, 1995; Redelmeier & Tibshirani, 1997; Savage et al., 2013). In a prior study we identified potential eye movement and EEG markers of cognitive distraction during driving hazard perception. However the extent to which these markers are affected by the demands of the hazard perception task are unclear. Therefore in the current study we assessed the effects of secondary cognitive task demand on eye movement and EEG metrics separately for periods prior to, during and after the hazard was visible. We found that when no hazard was present (prior and post hazard windows), distraction resulted in changes to various elements of saccadic eye movements. However, when the target was present, distraction did not affect eye movements. We have previously found evidence that distraction resulted in an overall decrease in theta band output at occipital sites of the brain. This was interpreted as evidence that distraction results in a reduction in visual processing. The current study confirmed this by examining the effects of distraction on the lambda response component of subjects eye fixation related potentials (EFRPs). Furthermore, we demonstrated that although detections of hazards were not affected by distraction, both eye movement and EEG metrics prior to the onset of the hazard were sensitive to changes in cognitive workload. This suggests that changes to specific aspects of the saccadic eye movement system could act as unobtrusive markers of distraction even prior to a breakdown in driving performance.

Pat Floyd played for the Newton County High School Lady Rams and was one of the best high school basketball players I’ve ever seen. She played when people thought girls needed to play three to a side. She could shoot the eyes out of it. I would purely love to have seen her play full court — and with a 3-point line.
 When I was 6 years old, I seriously injured my eye. I got a nylon cord wrapped around my bicycle pedal, somehow, while stopped on the sidewalk near my house to watch the big kids play ball. Pat was one of the big kids. Three years older than me. My sister’s age. She was at bat. I was pulling on the cord. It snapped. Almost put my eye out. I assumed Pat had hit me with a line drive and went home and told that to my daddy. She hadn’t.
 It took a year, but they fixed my eye.

I’m all for respecting the decisions of game developers, but respect is a two-way street.

The U.S. Federal Reserve cut interest rates on Tuesday in an emergency move designed to shield the world's largest economy from the impact of the coronavirus.                                                                                                                                                                                  It was the Fed's first emergency rate cut since 2008 at the height of the financial crisis, underscoring how grave the central bank views the fast-evolving situation. In a statement, the central bank said it was cutting rates by a half percentage point to a target range of 1.00% to 1.25%.                                                                                                                                                                                  "The fundamentals of the U.S. economy remain strong. However, the coronavirus poses evolving risks to economic activity. In light of these risks and in support of achieving its maximum employment and price stability goals, the Federal Open Market Committee decided today to lower the target range for the federal funds rate," the Fed said a statement. The decision was unanimous among policymakers.                                                                                                                                                                                  In a news conference, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said the coronavirus would weigh on the U.S. economy for some time. He said he believed the central bank's action would provide "a meaningful boost to the economy." “We saw a risk to the outlook for the economy and chose to act,” Powell said. “I do know that the U.S. economy is strong.. I fully expect that we will return to solid growth and a solid labor market as well.”                                                                                                                                                                                  The Fed's decision to cut interest rates before its next scheduled policy meeting on March 17-18 reflects the urgency with which the Fed feels it needs to act in order to prevent the possibility of a global recession. U.S. stocks initially surged on the move, which had increasingly been expected as it became evident the coronavirus would not be contained to its epicenter in China. With 90,000 cases worldwide in 77 countries and territories, the virus has upended global supply chains, triggered cancellations of sports events, business meetings and other large gatherings, and torpedoed global stock prices on fears it could cause a recession.                                                                                                                                                                                  Equities reversed many of their initial gains within minutes of the unscheduled announcement by the Federal Open Market Committee, the central bank's policy arm. U.S. Treasury debt prices surged, sending bond yields lower. Interest-rate futures traders immediately began pricing in even more rate cuts in coming months. "Normally, markets would welcome a rate cut, and they were hoping for it," said Peter Kenny, Founder of Kenny's Commentary LLC. "Now that we've got it, the question is what's next."                                                                                                                                                                                  Powell had earlier on Tuesday taken part in a conference call with the top finance authorities from the world's seven largest economies, which concluded with a statement that they would take all appropriate measures to support the economy. At his news conference, Powell said the Fed was in active discussions with other central banks. "I'm a little surprised. I didn't expect that at 10 o'clock today, I thought you'd see something coordinated among central banks," said Justin Lederer, interest rate strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald in New York.                                                                                                                                                                                  U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin applauded the Fed's decision, saying it would help the U.S. economy. In a tweet after the Fed move, President Donald Trump called on the central bank to cut even more. "More easing and more cutting," he said.

Federal spending on the military has not grown over the years — it has shrunk, and shrunk radically. Irrespective of whether you think that is a good thing or a mistake, the facts are worth knowing. From 1950-1960, those golden years for nostalgists and populists Left and Right, military spending accounted for not only the majority of federal outlays but the great majority — upwards of 70 percent at times. Defense accounted for about 60 percent of all federal spending in those years — in 2020, defense will account for 15 percent of federal spending. Looked at relative to the economy, we spent 10 percent of GDP on the military from 1950-1960; in 2020, we will spend 3.3 percent of GDP, a reduction in military spending of about two-thirds in GDP terms.

BELYOUNECH, Morocco (AP) — Fatima Mekhnas’ boots sink into the golden sand as she surveys the last beach in Morocco’s north.

The Supreme Court has set aside the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal’s (NCLAT) order against the approval of Dhanuka Laboratories’ resolution plan for the debt-ridden Chennai-based Orchid Pharma.
 The SC order in the case filed by the State Bank of India paves the way for the takeover of Orchid by Dhanuka Laboratories, whose resolution plan was approved by the Chennai bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) in June 2019.
 Orchid informed the exchanges about the apex court’s order on Tuesday.
 The SC’s division bench comprising Justice Rohinton Fali Nariman and Justice S. Ravindra Bhat said NCLAT’s order had to be set aside in view of a recent judgment, where it was categorically held that no provision in the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code or regulations have been brought to the court’s notice under which the bid by any resolution applicant has to match the liquidation value arrived at in the manner provided in the relevant regulations.
 “Accordingly, the appeal is allowed and the judgment of the NCLAT is set aside,” the order said. Orchid Pharma owes about ₹3,200 crore to a total of 24 banks. Orchid figured in RBI’s second list that had the names of 28 large defaulters.

Why are Bundesliga fans protesting against Hopp?                          Unlike the vast majority of clubs which follow the 50+1 rule which ensures that fans retain ownership of clubs, Hoffenheim is 96 per cent owned by Hopp. As a result, he has been able to use his huge financial clout to help the club turn from unknown amateurs into a top-flight team capable of qualifying for Europe. Hoffenheim qualified for the Champions League in 2018 under the guidance of head coach Julian Nagelsmann.

Marley spent her first day of freedom darting through the grass, digging her snout into the ground and curiously sniffing at the older pigs kept in a separate pen at Critter Creek Farm Sanctuary, 12626 NW County Road 231, in Gainesville.                           Her new friend Eli, a 2-week-old bull calf, showed less enthusiasm as he walked around the same pasture of grass. He was tuckered out after a long morning of running around outside under blue skies for the first time.                           The duo are the newest additions at Critter Creek, which recently expanded and now includes 410 acres across two locations where cows, pigs, horses, turkeys, donkeys and a water buffalo live out their days naturally.                           Erin and Chris Amerman founded the sanctuary in 2015 and frequently hold public events where people can learn more about being kind to animals typically misunderstood or only known from appearances on the dinner table.                           The new calf and piglet spent the past week traveling down the Eastern Seaboard --  Eli, from an organic dairy farm in Vermont; and Marley from North Carolina, where she slipped out from a container on board a van.                           Before arriving in Florida, said Erin Amerman, they were destined for a shorter life. Dairy farms have no use for males like Eli, she said, and most are sent to the slaughterhouse the day they are born. A select few are raised just a little longer to be turned into veal.                           "It's so sad to think he was on his way to the slaughterhouse," said Amerman, whose family are all vegan.                           Marley, like all piglets born into the meat industry, was separated from his mother shortly after birth. Piglets are then taken to a nursery to grow up for a few months before they arrive at their final farm destination, which is the place they ultimately die to become bacon and pork products at as young as 6 months old.                           "She fell off a transport van that was likely taking her to a nursery," Amerman said. At only about 2 weeks old, she was small enough to slip through a hole in a transport container. A person found her along the roadside covered in scrapes and took her to animal services.                           Soon, someone contacted Jason Bolalek, who lives in Vermont and operates Destination Liberation Rescue, a rescue service in which he finds new homes for former meat and dairy industry animals at sanctuaries across the nation. Just a month ago, he brought two other calves to Critter Creek.                           "This is paradise," he said. "This is how I believe animals should live. They should live out their lives naturally."                           Bolalek arrived at the farm with Eli and Marley late Sunday. By Monday afternoon, Marley walked around like she owned the place and Eli rubbed lovingly against everyone's pants and accepted head scratches.                           Amerman said Marley is picky when it comes to her milk. She only accepts it at the right temperature (warm like a cup of coffee).                           "She is very particular," she said. "She's kind of a diva. If it's not right, she'll tip the bowl over."                           Amerman said people don't view pigs or cows as friendly and loving like they would a dog, but pigs are just as likely to roll over for a belly rub, and cows are known to nudge your arm to be petted (just beware the bull's horns) and lay down next to you.                           "We just hope what we do here lets people see them in a different light," Amerman said. "Hopefully, it starts a conversation about how we see these animals and treat them."                           Critter Creek is hosting an open house event April 4, where visitors can learn about the organization and other nearby sanctuaries. Artists, food vendors and live music will also be on site.

Technical chart claims that Clovis Oncology, Inc. (CLVS) would settle between $7.62/share to $8/share level. However, if the stock price goes below the $6.85 mark, then the market for Clovis Oncology, Inc. becomes much weaker. If that happens, the stock price might even plunge as low as $6.46 for its downside target. The stock is currently in the red zone of MACD, with the indicator reading -0.95. Traders are always alerted for the move of a stock above or below the zero line due to the fact that the reading is an indicator of the position of the short-term average relative to the long-term average. If the MACD is above the zero line, then the short-term average relative is above that of the long-term average, thus implying an upward momentum. Vice versa is the case if the MACD is below the zero line.

Bernie Sanders is hiding nothing; he’s trying to claw his way to the Democratic nomination with a hammer in one hand and a sickle in the other. The Deep State prefers a more measured approach to dismantling the American way of life by offshoring industry, taking away company pensions with employee health insurance and forcing everyone into a single payer health care system. Congress cobbled an aristocratic escape hatch for itself — they get Cadillac health care, we get the junk yard Affordable Care Act — just like Cuba and Venezuela.                                                                                                                                                                                  Most U.S. citizens have no idea what an economic and ideological traitor Sanders is because the media never report it and U.S. liberal arts colleges swindle kids with bogus, politically correct history. The media know what the Communists have always known; propaganda works. They just flip the script in cahoots with a dirty American Stasi, pushing the absurd narrative that Trump is using Putin to win elections when it’s actually Sanders trying to replace Washington with Moscow.

This is important because, often times, a rising tide will lift all boats in an industry, as there can be broad trends taking place in a segment that are boosting securities across the board. This is arguably taking place in the Banks - Southwest space as it currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 24 out of more than 250 industries, suggesting it is well-positioned from this perspective, especially when compared to other segments out there.

A parliamentary panel on Tuesday suggested lower GST rate for the automobile segment at least till the revival of the sector, and uniform road tax across all states against the backdrop of negative growth in the automobile production since July 2018. A parliamentary panel had examined the Demands for Grants 2020-21 of Department of Heavy Industry DHI and tabled its report in Parliament.The automobile industry in India is one of the largest and fastest-growing sector and constitutes 27 per cent of industrial gross domestic product GDP and 49 per cent of manufacturing GDP. It provides about 37 million direct and indirect jobs and 15 per cent of total GST collection amounting to Rs 1.5 lakh crore. But, the committee observes that of late, there is a negative growth in the automobile production since July 2018, said the report.The committee noted that some of the factors that contributed to slowdown are non-availability of credit facility to consumers, stringent rules for loan sanction by banks, rise in price due to the upfront payment of third-party insurance for 5 years, introduction of BS-VI vehicles from April 2020 and higher rate of GST on automobiles and components. Amid slowdown in the sector, the committee, among other things, recommended to either suspend or postpone the upfront payment of insurance for 5 years for the time being and reduction in GST rate to a lower slab at least till the revival of the auto sector.Further, it made a case for introduction of incentive-based scrappage policy for creating purchase demand for new vehicles, reduction in import duty on lithium-ion cell battery which is used for operating the e-vehicles and levy of uniform road tax across all states. The report said the committee is pleased to note that the Delhi-Chandigarh highway has been declared as the first e-vehicle friendly expressway of the country.It desires that other expressways, including Delhi-Jaipur and Mumbai-Pune expressways, may also be made completely e-vehicle friendly soon with charging infrastructure in place at regular and frequent intervals..

The International Olympic Committee (IOC) on Tuesday gave further unequivocal backing to this summer`s Tokyo Olympics, urging athletes to prepare  full steam  despite the coronavirus threat.  We are preparing for a successful Olympic Games, Tokyo 2020,  IOC head Thomas Bach said at an executive board meeting to discuss the July 24-Aug. 9 sporting extravaganza. Earlier on Tuesday, Japan`s Olympics minister Seiko Hashimoto had said that details within Tokyo`s contract with the IOC  could be interpreted as allowing a postponement  until the end of the year. That host city contract states that one of several triggers which would allow the IOC to withdraw the Games from Tokyo would be if  the Games are not celebrated during the year 2020 . Hashimoto said, however, that Japan`s government and Tokyo were still committed to the Games beginning on July 24, and the IOC has repeatedly swatted aside any suggestions of a postponement. The Olympic body said again on Tuesday there was no Plan B, and that the Games would take place in their allotted time slot. WREAK HAVOC Any change to dates would instantly wreak havoc on most sports programmes, with competition calendars planned several years ago to accommodate the Tokyo timings. Finding a new date in 2020 at this stage, which would firstly need the green light from the IOC, would be extremely difficult, if not impossible, for the 33 sports federations present in Tokyo. Bach, a 66-year-old lawyer and former Olympic fencing champion, has an iron grip on IOC decision-making and is known for sticking to his guns in adversity.  I would like to encourage all the athletes to continue their preparation for the Olympic Games, Tokyo 2020 with great confidence and full steam,  the German told reporters in Lausanne.  From our side, we will continue to support the athletes and the National Olympic Committees.  Multiple sports events around the world have been cancelled during the epidemic, which has killed more than 3,000 people in China and spread to more than 60 nations including Japan where infections are near 1,000 and 12 people have died. SMALLER CROWDS Crowds will be smaller and receptions have been scrapped at the Tokyo 2020 torch lighting ceremony in ancient Olympia, Greece, next week as the Hellenic Olympic Committee (HOC) introduced measures to protect against the coronavirus, it said on Tuesday. Despite concerns over possible health risks to spectators and participants at the Games, the Olympic body is unwilling to publicly discuss any other option, such as cancellation or postponement. The IOC board said a joint task force had been created two weeks ago, involving the IOC, the Tokyo Games organisers, the city, the government, and the World Health Organisation to help deal with the coronavirus ahead of the Olympics.  The IOC EB appreciates and supports the measures being taken, which constitute an important part of Tokyo`s plans to host safe and secure Games,  the task force said in a statement. Tokyo has pumped in more than $12 billion to organise the event, while billions more were spent on related projects. Tokyo Games organisers are due to deliver a report via video conference to the executive board on Wednesday.

TORONTO -- The Canadian dollar fell          against the greenback on Tuesday, giving up much of the prior          day's rally, as the Federal Reserve cut interest rates in an          emergency move that investors see the Bank of Canada matching at          a policy decision on Wednesday.              At 11:41 a.m. (1641 GMT), the Canadian dollar          was          trading 0.3% lower at 1.3359 to the greenback, or 74.86 U.S.          cents. The currency, which on Friday hit its weakest intraday          level in nearly nine months at 1.3465, traded in a range of          1.3319 to 1.3383.              The U.S. central bank said it was cutting rates by a half          percentage point to a target range of 1.00% to 1.25% as the          "coronavirus poses evolving risks to economic activity."              The Bank of Canada had been expected by investors to cut its          benchmark interest rate, which sits at 1.75%, by 25 basis points          on Wednesday. Money markets quickly shifted gear to price in a          50 basis points move.                                     It would be the first 50 basis points cut by the central          bank since March 2009.              "Twenty-five basis points may prompt loonie strength and          derail the stimulus of the cut itself, while 50 basis points          could stoke a housing bubble," said Simon Harvey, FX market          analyst for Monex Europe and Monex Canada.              "Markets are running with the fact that the latter is a less          concerning risk at the moment and are aggressively pricing a          similar 50 bps from the BoC," Harvey said.              Canada is a major exporter of commodities, including oil, so          a slowdown in the global economy due to the coronavirus outbreak          could hurt.              The Canadian government is open to the idea of helping firms          that are suffering from financial damage due to the outbreak of          a novel coronavirus, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said, without          providing details.                               U.S. crude oil futures        were up 0.9% at $47.13 a          barrel but shares on Wall Street lost ground in volatile trade          as investors worried that the Fed cut might not be enough to          shield the world's largest economy from the impact of the          coronavirus epidemic.                           Canadian government bond yields tumbled across a steeper          yield curve in sympathy with U.S. Treasuries. The 10-year yield                      was down 11.6 basis points at 0.986%, its lowest          level since October 2016.

The coronavirus crisis is adding to the doom and gloom in the oil industry. The sector has been slammed by years of over production that kept a lid on prices and sparked periodic commodity crashes.

What Lierop is missing here is the potential for a broader consumer base. If more people gain access to more games without the expensive price barrier of purchasing all that expensive hardware, savings can be funneled into software sales. If I save $1000 on hardware and I have all that cash lying around to play games on GeForce Now, pulling your game __ only limits potential sales. If I have some extra money to burn since I’m playing on GeForce Now rather than buying a new PC, well I can’t use it to buy _Destiny 2_ or _Skyrim_ or _The Long Dark_ anymore. I’ll spend my money elsewhere.

Back in 2002, I purchased an original Xbox. Although I already had a PlayStation 2 and Nintendo Gamecube at the time, the Xbox became my go-to system. If a game I wanted was available on multiple systems, I would always pick up the Xbox version.                                                                                                                                                                                      Despite enjoying Xbox exclusives like the first two Halo games, when it came time to upgrade to a new system a few years later I went with the PlayStation 3 over the Xbox 360, and I really haven't had an overwhelming desire to return to the Xbox ecosystem since.                                                                                                                                                                                      But Microsoft has slowly been winning me over.                                                                                                                                                                                      It started with services like Xbox Game Pass, which cost $10 a month and gives you unlimited access to over 100 games, including all new Microsoft first-party titles the day they release.                                                                                                                                                                                      Then earlier this week, Phil Harrison, the head of Xbox, posted a letter on Xbox.com giving a lot of new information on the upcoming Xbox Series X, and the machine sounds great.                                                                                                                                                                                      Xbox Series X is going to be a beast of a home console. The new system, expected to launch this holiday season, will be powered by Microsoft's custom-designed processor featuring AMD's Zen 2 and RDNA 2 architectures. I'm not a PC gamer, so I don't know what that means, but Harrison wrote in his letter that the new system will have four times the processing power of an Xbox One and that its 12 TFLOPS of GPU is twice that of an Xbox One X and more than eight times the original Xbox One.                                                                                                                                                                                      "Xbox Series X delivers a true generational leap in processing and graphics power with cutting edge techniques resulting in higher framerates, larger, more sophisticated game worlds, and an immersive experience unlike anything seen in console gaming," Harrison wrote in his letter.                                                                                                                                                                                      Its SSD hard drive will allow for game worlds that are larger, more dynamic and load much faster than the current systems allow.                                                                                                                                                                                      A new feature Harrison announced that sounds exciting to me is the new Quick Resume. The new system will let you suspend multiple games at one time, turn your system off and then return to them later almost instantly without having to wait through long loading screens.                                                                                                                                                                                      Harrison also talked about Xbox's commitment to games and gamers. All Xbox One games will be compatible with Xbox Series X, as will a large number of original Xbox and Xbox 360 titles, all them with faster load times, steadier frame rates and sharper graphics because of the increased power in the Series X.                                                                                                                                                                                      He also touted Microsoft's new Smart Delivery technology, in which a gamer will be able to buy certain games, all first-party Microsoft titles and some third-party titles, once and it will be optimized for whatever system you're playing it on.                                                                                                                                                                                      Not long after Xbox released all the new details on the Series X, game developer CD Projekt Red announced its upcoming "Cyberpunk 2077" will take advantage of Smart Delivery.                                                                                                                                                                                      Now is all of that enough for me to leave the PlayStation nation and jump ship to Xbox?                                                                                                                                                                                      I'm pretty well tied into the PlayStation platform. The Uncharted series is probably my favorite franchise in gaming, so it would be difficult for me to switch sides and pick up an Xbox Series X over a PlayStation 5.                                                                                                                                                                                      That being said, Microsoft is making some great decisions with the Xbox Series X, and everything they announced this week sounds terrific. A week ago I was 100% getting a PlayStation 5 this holiday season. While I am still very much leaning in that direction, Microsoft has swayed me some and given me something else to consider.

By investing in a diversified real estate portfolio, clients can avoid the volatility of the stock market brought about by economic scares, the corona virus, and the uncertainty of an election year. While some investors fear the disruption of the supply chain in China could put a damper on global economic expansion, many don’t think that a recession will follow. Furthermore, due to low supply levels of housing nationwide, many feel it is less likely that one would affect the real estate market as drastically as it would the stock market.

Russias communications regulator on Tuesday accused the BBC World News channel of flouting Russian broadcasting rules and said a court would hear its detailed complaints later this month.Britains ties with Russia are at post-Cold War lows over the 2018 poisoning of Sergei Skripal, a mole who betrayed hundreds of Russian agents to Britains MI6 foreign spy service. Britain said Russian military intelligence poisoned Skripal and his daughter Yulia with a Soviet-developed nerve agent known as Novichok. Russia repeatedly denied any involvement and said Britain staged the attack to stoke anti-Russian hysteria.Moscow has repeatedly told London that British media like the BBC should expect consequences if Russias state-financed RT television channel encounters difficulties in Britain. Ofcom, Britains media regulator, last year fined RT for breaching impartiality rules in broadcasts over the Skripal poisoning, the conflict in Syria, and Ukraines polices on Nazism and gypsies.On Tuesday, Russias communications regulator, Roskomnadzor, said the BBC had failed to label violent or upsetting content with the correct age certificate and had not submitted copies of its content to the Russian authorities on time. Moscow could hit the BBC with two fines of up to 200,000 roubles 3,050 for the first offense and up to 20,000 roubles for the second. The court hearing is due on March 12, Roskomnadzor said.The BBC did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 1  65.4150 roubles

India has 60 million micro-businesses, micro SMEs. These are companies ranging from two-three employees to 100 employees. There are 60 million of them, and they all want to get digitised. And if you offer them monolithic services, they will never take them. So, you have got to give them a plug and play kind of offering. I need offering, which is coming to me in a box, I plug it in, itself-configures, and I’m in business. For that, these three broader things need to be sorted for India to thrive in this digital era.

Having said that, we need fiberisation; we need congestion-free transport networks. That is a challenge for India because we are still only 35-40 per cent fiberised. A lot has happened in the last couple of years. Jio is playing fibre now, Bharti and Vodafone to an extent. There are some new players emerging in the market, but there is still a long way to go. Hence, I believe more than 5G, I think getting the transport networks right is a priority for India.

Technical chart claims that Oasis Petroleum Inc. (OAS) would settle between $1.66/share to $1.8/share level. However, if the stock price goes below the $1.43 mark, then the market for Oasis Petroleum Inc. becomes much weaker. If that happens, the stock price might even plunge as low as $1.34 for its downside target. The stock is currently in the red zone of MACD, with the indicator reading -0.2. Traders are always alerted for the move of a stock above or below the zero line due to the fact that the reading is an indicator of the position of the short-term average relative to the long-term average. If the MACD is above the zero line, then the short-term average relative is above that of the long-term average, thus implying an upward momentum. Vice versa is the case if the MACD is below the zero line.

Wary of the spread of the COVID-19 infection to Jammu & Kashmir, the administration on Tuesday designated the Maternity Centre in Srinagar’s Sanat Nagar area as an isolation ward and set up screening centres at all surface and air entry points to the Union Territory.                          “Checkpoints with the deployment of a team of doctors will be set up at Railway Stations, Airports, us stands and entry points of J&K, especially Lakhanpur, for screening passengers for the coronavirus,” said J&K Chief Secretary B.V.R. Subrahmanyam, who chaired a meeting in Jammu.                          Divisional Commissioner, Kashmir, Baseer Ahmad Khan, who visited the Srinagar Airport, took stock of the preparedness and arrangements put in place for the screening of passengers and tourists.                          Five coronavirus helpdesks have been established at the Srinagar Airport, with infra-red thermometers, viral kits, personal protection gear, special ambulances and other equipment.                          “The airport authorities will announce in all flights that every passenger has to record travel history at the coronavirus helpdesks in a prescribed format before leaving the premises. Passengers coming from coronavirus-affected countries should be properly screened and tested at the helpdesks,” Mr. Khan said.                          These desks have been directed to share details with higher authorities on an hourly basis.

Philippine economic cycles followed the American pattern. But these real output indicators (when compared and plotted on paper across the depression years to the close of the outbreak of the World War II) showed a trend toward positive growth for the Philippines. Those for the US economy, in turn, showed a picture of persistent stagnation.

Technical chart claims that Primo Water Corporation (PRMW) would settle between $14.53/share to $15.05/share level. However, if the stock price goes below the $13.69 mark, then the market for Primo Water Corporation becomes much weaker. If that happens, the stock price might even plunge as low as $13.37 for its downside target. The stock is currently in the red zone of MACD, with the indicator reading -0.38. Traders are always alerted for the move of a stock above or below the zero line due to the fact that the reading is an indicator of the position of the short-term average relative to the long-term average. If the MACD is above the zero line, then the short-term average relative is above that of the long-term average, thus implying an upward momentum. Vice versa is the case if the MACD is below the zero line.

TORONTO -- The novel coronavirus has whipsawed stock markets but investors shouldn't take Monday's sharp rebound as a signal that volatility has ended, say investment experts.          "It's too soon to say that everything has been straightened out and the all clear has been blown," says Greg Taylor, chief investment officer of Purpose Investments.          He said investors should take a measured approach because the bounce after the worst week since global financial crisis may not last.          U.S. stock markets gained as much as 5.1 per cent Monday while the TSX was up 1.8 per cent after losing 12.9 and eight per cent, respectively, from record highs.          The fear of the unknown surrounding the virus that's spread from China to scores of countries is what caused last week's deep selloff. Markets can move higher with evidence that the virus is contained but all bets are off with a pandemic that severely hits companies.          "We are dealing with so many unknowns it's impossible to call the bottom right now," Taylor said in an interview.          Part of the volatility was the result of big investors like pension funds rebalancing portfolios at the end of the month and then reallocating money to start March.          "It was really a period where it seemed like a lot of people were just selling whatever they could to try and get some cash into the doors and that looks to me like classic capitulation selling," he said.          What's troubling for stock market watchers is that the bond market isn't confirming a bounceback. The U.S. 10-year treasury yields are still falling and sitting around 1.1 per cent, which is an extreme downward move from where they started the year.          The market dip could be an opportunity to buy quality stocks at a discount but investors shouldn't be in a rush.          "There's still going to be more volatility throughout the next few months and you will get different opportunities but if you have a lot of cash this is not a bad time to start looking at opportunities."          Investors should have a long-term plan that reflects their financial goals so they don't give in to fears when times get tough or take unnecessary risks, said Jeff Hull, senior financial adviser at Manulife Securities Inc.          He cautions against chasing the get-rich-quick schemes by investing in companies that could benefit from coronavirus, such as makers of face masks like 3M.          Masks are a very small part of 3M's business and won't have a meaningful impact on earnings.          And the benefits could quickly dissipate once the virus inevitably starts to burn out.          "The most important thing is people need to be patient, pick their moments right and most importantly they need to look for great companies at attractive discounts, companies that they want to hold for the longer term," he said.          Hull said investors shouldn't rush to buy and "bet the farm" on companies just because their stock price is a little cheaper.          Michael Greenberg, portfolio manager at Franklin Templeton-Multi Asset Solutions, said he began chipping away by buying a little on Friday but thinks volatility will continue for the next month or so.          Diversification is key. And that means also considering Chinese firms, which have been the best performers on Asian markets in the past couple of weeks.          While stocks have sold off, government bonds and many liquid alternative strategies have done just the opposite. "This should be a powerful reminder of the benefits in having a well-diversified portfolio," said Mark Stacey, head of portfolio management at AGF Investments Inc.          "By allocating to a range of low and/or negatively correlated asset classes, investors are better able to limit losses from a market correction, and should also be rewarded with reduced portfolio volatility, leaving them positioned to recover any of the losses they do incur more quickly."          Markets are likely to bounce around and weaken as more cases confirm the spread of the virus and its economic implications, said Craig Fehr, an investment strategist at Edward Jones.          "Last week is exactly what panic looks like in the equity markets," he said.          Fehr said it's a good time to review your goals and make some adjustments, rebalance portfolios and eventually add investments in the dip.          But that doesn't mean changing your investment strategy because of a 10, 12 or 15 per cent pullback in equity markets.          "They happen frequently, they just don't happen as violently as we saw last week but I don't think it alters the very long-term outlook for the economy or the markets. I think this is more of a temporary setback."          In fact, it doesn't even mean investors should expect to lose money this year, said Allan Small, senior investment adviser at HollisWealth.          "I don't think the year is a write off because we've seen one week of a correction," he said.          "Everyone who's treating this like the end of the world I think they're going to be mistaken and I think the markets will rebound, it's just a matter of when, not if."

It was never a case of if, but when the novel coronavirus would start spreading in the U.S. — and now it’s happening. Multiple states reported new cases over the weekend, and more are likely to emerge in the next few days. It’s becoming clear that the country isn’t as prepared, and its early response wasn’t as robust as President Donald Trump has claimed.                                                                                                                                                                                  The administration is starting to do some of the right things. It’s working to boost testing capacity, and that will help health workers get a handle on the spread of the disease and aid in containment; health officials are also now looking for cases entering the country from outside of China. These steps came far too slowly, however, leading to missed opportunities to catch and prevent infections.                                                                                                                                                                                  Because of the peculiarities of the American health-care system, the U.S. can’t only seek to replicate measures that have worked in other countries if it’s going to have the best possible chance at containing the Covid-19 virus. There is a long list of other actions worth taking within days rather than weeks.

Start with the taxes. In real terms, Americans paid almost exactly the same taxes in the 1950s as they pay today. Federal taxes from 1950-1960 averaged 16.8 percent of GDP; this year, federal taxes are projected to amount to almost exactly the same: 16.7 percent of GDP. There were some very high statutory (that’s how political types say “on paper”) income-tax rates in those years — 91 percent at one point — but practically nobody paid those rates. In fact, in spite of the claims you hear from Senator Sanders et al., wealthy Americans pay remarkably similar tax rates today to what they paid in the past. If you dig into the Congressional Budget Office numbers, you’ll see that the effective total federal tax rate for the top quintile and the top 1 percent have not moved very much over the years.

SHARJAH, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News / WAM - 03rd Mar, 2020) H.H. Dr. Sheikh Sultan bin Muhammad Al Qasimi, Supreme Council Member and Ruler of Sharjah, will witness the opening of the two-day International Government Communication Forum, IGCF, on Wednesday at the Expo Centre Sharjah, aimed at reinforcing the growing importance of establishing responsible, transparent and innovation-driven communication channels between governments and citizens to ensure a highly participatory governance and drive sustainable development.                           The organisers, International Government Communication Centre, IGCC, a subsidiary of Sharjah Government Media Bureau, brought together 64 leading global thinkers, top government officials, media influencers and communications and technology experts from across 16 nations to lead a robust forum agenda, featuring 57 diversified events and discussions.                           The 15 main sessions, 10 keynote speeches, nine workshops, three brainstorming sessions and 20 specialised forums, which will be delivered at the ninth edition of the IGCF 2020, are based on four key pillars: Embedding a culture of engagement in government, technology as a community enabler, communication through culture, and holistic well-being.                           Sheikh Sultan bin Ahmed Al Qasimi, Chairman, Sharjah Media Council, said, "The forum translates the vision and directives of His Highness the Ruler of Sharjah to raise awareness among individuals and organisations and provide them with the right tools to express their opinions at an international level and reflect the strengths of Arab culture in the best possible way."                           Sheikh Fahim bin Sultan Al Qasimi, Executive Chairman of the Department of Government Relations, Sharjah, said, "Through our participation, we will showcase our wealth of experience and achievements in this field and learn from other organisations. We believe that communication is an ever-evolving process, and we need to continually keep ‎abreast ‎of ‎the latest trends and best practices in this industry to achieve maximum efficiency."                           Tariq Saeed Allay, Director of Sharjah Government Media Bureau, said, "Based on the directives of His Highness Ruler of Sharjah, IGCF has brought global expertise and insights in the communication field to Sharjah, which has served to advance this sector at the local, regional and international levels."                           Juan Santos, the former President of the Republic of Colombia and Nobel Peace prize winner, said, "I am going to talk about the importance of dialogue to sustain peace between people and cultures who think differently or have different values. In today’s polarised world, we need to recover the value of arguments over emotions and to realise that we all live in one common house. I hope that this forum will contribute to the understanding of the different challenges that we face today because only by understanding the challenges, can we overcome them."                           Irina Bokova, President of the academy for Cultural Diplomacy and Director-General of UNESCO (2009–2017) said, "In our age of diversity, we need to equip people with the tools they need to speak in different languages, to live together in diverse cities, to deal with multi-layered identities and affiliations, to know and respect the culture of others. This is critical to preventing conflict, to foster dialogue, peace and sustainable development. I look forward to discussing this important topic during the IGCF in Sharjah."                           Michaëlle Jean, Governor General and Commander-in-Chief of Canada (2005–2010) said, "I applaud the Government of Sharjah’s willingness to seek innovative new strategies in the area of communications and I look forward to sharing what has worked in the Canadian context, and in particular, the important role that access to information has played in citizen engagement.

Technical chart claims that Conformis, Inc. (CFMS) would settle between $0.95/share to $1.01/share level. However, if the stock price goes below the $0.8 mark, then the market for Conformis, Inc. becomes much weaker. If that happens, the stock price might even plunge as low as $0.7 for its downside target. The stock is currently in the red zone of MACD, with the indicator reading -0.09. Traders are always alerted for the move of a stock above or below the zero line due to the fact that the reading is an indicator of the position of the short-term average relative to the long-term average. If the MACD is above the zero line, then the short-term average relative is above that of the long-term average, thus implying an upward momentum. Vice versa is the case if the MACD is below the zero line.

And you might try a love triangle of sorts: using two cards in tandem to find chemistry. A flashier one for outsize rewards on some spending -- like 5% back on gas or groceries -- and a reliable one for all other spending, preferably at least 1.5% back.

“Didn’t Bernie have a heart attack? Did he go to Venezuela to get treatment? Did he go to Cuba or Canada? Did he go to Canada? Of course he didn’t! He got treated here. Why? Because he wanted to live, that’s why,” Gorka said.

Make the UK the best place for postgraduate research training, strengthening the country's position as a research superpower and laying the foundations for future R&D-led growth, economic and social transformation. The UK will need a significant new pool of research talent in business, universities, the public and third sectors and the UK should be ambitious, not cut corners. The full economic costs of this training should be met from public funds.

The value of Lebanon's currency has plummeted, and inflation is rising. Two currencies -- the Lebanese pound (LBP) and the U.S. dollar -- are used interchangeably in Lebanon. While the Lebanese pound has officially been pegged to the dollar at LBP 1507.5 since 1998, increasing dollar shortages recently have pushed rates in the black market as high as LBP 2,500. This has threatened imports of essential goods from abroad and reduced individual purchasing power.

Lagarde’s ECB is being squeezed between the proverbial economic/monetary rock and a hard place. On one hand the internal staff forecasts are still relaxed. That is, in my book, a case of being far too complacent. However, even the most optimistic staffer cannot ignore the risk that coronavirus poses to an already fragile and cash strapped European economic region.

You've heard Allegra Miles before.                                               Her voice reverberates throughout Palm Beach County, from independent coffee shops, to bars, restaurants and local concerts. She's hard to miss. The 17-year-old pop and soul singer-songwriter is regularly seen clutching her acoustic guitar or strumming the piano, performing original songs and covers, and networking around the local music and art scene.                                               And now, after four separate attempts at trying to make it on the show, the West Palm Beach resident is set to make her debut in the blind auditions on season 18 of NBC's "The Voice." Miles "never thought it would happen for real."                                               "After every audition that I didn't get further in the process, a lot of times I'd be like 'maybe this is not meant for me' - I'm just not meant to do this," Miles said, during a sit-down chat with The Post. "But I had a little voice in the back of my head - 'this is like something for you that would be really cool and really good for you, and would mean a lot.'"                                                From E.R. Bradley's Saloon to Common Grounds coffee shop, fans in West Palm are often mesmerized by her stage presence, vocal skills and poise. She's hoping, the coaches on "The Voice," Blake Shelton, Kelly Clarkson, and Nick Jonas, feel the same.                             Preparing for 'that big moment'                             Miles was confident and ready. But that wasn't always the case.                                               "It's almost like preparing for the impossible," Miles said. It's "a mental thing" and the nerves never seem to go away, on and off the stage, before and after the show, because "there is really nothing that can prepare you for that moment."                                               "It's terrifying"                                               Related: Florida teen has spot on 'American Idol'                                               But Miles, who is originally from San Diego and the Virgin Islands, was born for this moment. Her dedicated music family moved to West Palm Beach six years ago and kept the rhythm going. "Music has always been in my environment - it's just been a given," she said. She doesn't recall when she actually set out to be a musician because it was just "innate."                                               "I started playing guitar and writing songs when I was 12, I think. It was just kind of a natural progression because of my mom - she was always playing gigs, and I always saw her and my dad playing together."                                               Music and writing is also Mile's personal refuge - the stage and page, she says, is where she finds her peace during her darkest times. It's where she could "put into words what she was feeling."                                               "In my lowest points of depression, when I was really questioning why I'm even here - the only thing that was a solace for me was music," Miles said. "That's the only thing.

Miles says that despite her many attempts at making the show, she always kept the faith and understood that individual "process" and "journey" is regulated by "timing."                                               "If I had lost faith, I wouldn't have done this. I wouldn't be here," Miles said.                                               "To realize in the back of your mind every time you get a rejection or something happens that's part of your journey. That's making you stronger. That's preparing you for your moment when it finally comes."

Hageman's most recent motion asks the court to reconsider its previous order to dismiss the case in light of this new information that demonstrates the USDA continues to move forward with a plan to mandate RFID, that it has refused to take steps to prevent the publication of this misinformation, and that it has utterly failed to properly notify the public that the RFID requirement has been withdrawn. Hageman states that USDA's actions are contrary to its prior assurance to the court that no such plans would be pursued without following the lawful notice and comment rulemaking process.

The 30-45 minute modules are made by matrixed teams of experienced designers, animators, category experts and programmers, who together produce each discreet experience. To date, Talespin has only completed eight modules. Because he’s been around the entertainment business his entire career, Jackson has a good working knowledge of the 2D production process. “It is similar, '' he said, “because we cast each module with experienced designers. Unlike a movie, this medium is plastic, changeable, and can be updated on the fly.” Through data collection and machine learning, the modules could be “realer than real.”

Putin and Erdogan spoke by telephone on Friday. On Saturday, Erdogan told reporters in Istanbul that he asked Putin about Russia’s “business” in Syria, adding that while Turkey didn’t mind if Russia established a base in the country, it should “get out of our way and leave us face to face with the [Syrian] regime.”

The Trump administration supported Texas, and its lawyers urged the Supreme Court to turn away the appeal.                                                                                                                                                                                  At issue now is whether the healthcare law is unconstitutional because the Republican-controlled Congress voted in 2017 to stop applying a tax penalty required under the act on those who do not have insurance.                                                                                                                                                                                  Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton asserted, and a federal judge in Fort Worth agreed that the entire law must be voided. They theorized that the so-called mandate to buy insurance was an essential element of the law, and that by reducing the penalty to zero, Congress had effectively struck down the entire statute.                                                                                                                                                                                  Trump’s lawyers later joined the case and endorsed this theory that the entire law must fall, despite strong criticism from legal experts on the left and right. Republican efforts to repeal Obamacare, including popular provisions like the protections for preexisting conditions, helped Democrats take back the House in 2018, and they plan to make healthcare an issue in 2020.                                                                                                                                                                                  Becerra stepped in to defend the law after the Justice Department refused to do so. When Democrats took control of the House, their lawyers also joined in defense of the law.                                                                                                                                                                                  For all of last year, the case sat before the 5th Circuit Court in New Orleans. A three-judge panel, with two Republican appointees and one Democratic appointee, heard arguments in July and finally handed down an inconclusive ruling in late December. Judges Jennifer Walker Elrod and Kurt Engelhardt agreed the mandate was now void and unconstitutional, but they sent the case back to the district judge in Ft. Worth to reconsider whether other parts must be voided as well.                                                                                                                                                                                  In dissent, Judge Carolyn Dineen King said the status of the so-called mandate was nothing but an “academic curiosity,” with no practical consequence. “People can purchase insurance — or not — as they please,” she wrote.                                                                                                                                                                                  In January, Becerra appealed and urged the justices to bypass the appeals court and to hear the case on a fast track so a ruling could be issued by summer. The court turned down the request to decide quickly.                                                                                                                                                                                  It would have taken five votes within the court to hear the appeal on an expedited basis, but only four votes to grant review. It’s possible the chief justice and his four fellow conservatives were not in favor of deciding the case on a fast track this term, but the four liberal justices voted to hear the appeal during the fall, knowing that Roberts has already voted twice to uphold the law.

Moscow could hit the BBC with two fines of up to 200,000 roubles ($3,050) for the first offense and up to 20,000 roubles for the second.

With data becoming the main business and video becoming the main business, and all of it is happening at the edge of the network, we need to solve for this end-to-end. From an Indian perspective, operators have started that journey, but they are not there yet. The issue is we talk about 5G, it is a buzz word now, but 5G takes care of the low latency, but if the data has to travel through this long journey, then zero or low latency has no meaning. You have to first fix the back-end before you fix the front-end. The second thing is, it is very expensive, the spectrum is costly, so there is no point bringing this data back to the central repository. Use it, extract value out of it and get rid of it where it gets created. If you look at the bigger web players, they have really used AI, ML and deep analytics to build their businesses.
