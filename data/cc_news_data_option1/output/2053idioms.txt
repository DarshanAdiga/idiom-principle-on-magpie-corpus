LOS ANGELES -- Walt Disney Co will present its proposal for a phased reopening of its Orlando, Florida, theme parks to a local task force on Wednesday, the company said in a statement.
 Disney closed theme parks around the world starting in January to help prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus.
 It began reopening the parks earlier this month by allowing a limited number of guests into Shanghai Disneyland with social distancing and other safeguards. Guests must wear masks and have their temperatures checked, among other measures.
 A Disney executive will detail the company's plans for Walt Disney World in Orlando to the Orange County Economic Recovery Task Force on Wednesday. The county must approve Disney's plan before sending it to the governor's office, which also must sign off before the parks can open their gates to the public.
 Disney operates four theme parks at Walt Disney World that attracted 157.3 million visitors in 2018, according to the Themed Entertainment Association. They rank as the most-visited theme parks in the world.
 Last week, shops and restaurants at the Disney Springs shopping area outside the Orlando parks reopened to visitors for the first time since March.
 Sea World Entertainment Inc also will present a reopening plan to the Orange County task force on Wednesday, a statement from the county said. (Reporting by Lisa Richwine; editing by Jonathan Oatis and Tom Brown)

Bloomberg) -- When 62-year-old Tomas Morales registered a fever of 101.3 Fahrenheit on April 14, the doctor told him to self-isolate. But there was a problem: Morales was on an oil platform off the Mexican coast only reachable by helicopter, and he shared a bedroom with three other workers.
 Morales improvised, using a curtain to separate his bed from those of his companions, yet they still had to use the same bathroom. It took two days for Morales to be evacuated from the platform, followed by a three-hour bus trip to his home and, eventually, a move into a company-run hospital.
 Morales's case and others open new questions about the ability of Mexico's state-owned oil company, Petroleos Mexicanos, to protect workers amid the Covid-19 pandemic. Seventy two workers and two contractors have died from the virus, the company reported on Monday. As many as eight died in one day.
 "We weren't prepared," Morales said, speaking by telephone from his home in Paraiso. "There weren't sufficient control measures for Covid-19 because this was something totally new for everyone."
 Critics say Pemex's actions mirror that of the administration of President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, which was slow to enforce a national lockdown and has chosen not to shut down its ports of entry or restrict visitors from countries with a high number of Covid-19 cases.
 Pemex responded in a statement that it's taking great pains to protect its workers. The company is "sanitizing, sending workers home, and taking other measures to distribute supplies to keep work places and equipment clean."
 Oil companies in the Gulf of Mexico are grappling with the challenge of maintaining operations amid social distancing and sanitizing on thousands of offshore drilling rigs and oil production platforms. The platforms house hundreds of people and require workers to sleep in shared rooms and eat together in crowded dining halls.
 Yet the death toll at Pemex has soared above peers.
 As of May 22, there were no deaths in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico among "about 25,000 people rotating on and offshore", according to Justin Williams, a spokesman for the National Ocean Industries Association. Brazil's Petrobras, which has about 40% fewer employees than Pemex, has not reported fatalities from Covid-19. Brazil's National Petroleum Agency says one offshore contract worker died from the virus, without saying which company the person worked for.
 Pemex's 72 virus deaths are almost 1% of the national total of 7,633.
 "It is necessary to emphasize the importance that people who work in strategic facilities in the country, such as oil and electricity, are taken care of in a timely manner, and that all necessary measures are taken to prevent outbreaks both in the personnel (in the facilities) as well as in their communities," said Dr. Mauricio Rodriguez, spokesman for the Covid-19 committee at the National Autonomous University of Mexico.
 Pemex's relatively new management team, which took over after Lopez Obrador became president in December 2018, is at least partly to blame for not containing the virus, said Pablo Lopez Figueroa, a Pemex employee and representative of the National Union of Petroleum Technicians and Professionals. The newly formed oil workers' union competes with the official Pemex union.
 "General management has zero oil experience, very little capacity to understand technical activities and no clear idea of how to reduce the risk of contagion right now in the marine area," said Figueroa, speaking over the phone from Paraiso, Tabasco.
 Morales, the platform worker, wasn't tested for the virus until 10 days after his fever started. The mechanical integrity engineer at the Abkatun-Pol-Chuc offshore field, said others on his platform had also complained of flu-like symptoms.
 "The platform doctor told me to hold it together because there were others more screwed than I was," he said.
 Maintaining Operations
 Pemex faces the added challenge of reversing 15 years of oil output declines and staggering debt, the highest of any oil major. Its strategy of accelerating drilling in onshore and shallow-water fields hit a roadblock as cities all over the world came to a halt amid efforts to stem the Covid-19 outbreak, and it faces a glut in fuel supply as demand has cratered.
 While oil companies the world over are reducing capital expenditure amid the oil price crash and pandemic, Lopez Obrador has tasked Pemex and the Energy Ministry with continuing daily work on a new $8 billion refinery in the president's home state. The so-called Dos Bocas refinery is symbolic of the government's agenda to rid the country of dependence on foreign gasoline markets, with works continuing even as non-essential businesses across Mexico are under lockdown.
 After Pemex evacuated Morales from the oil platform, the company told him to self-isolate in a hotel in Ciudad del Carmen, Campeche -- and to pay for it himself, he said. Instead, he hopped on a three-hour bus to his home in Paraiso, Tabasco. There, Morales's fever worsened and he was eventually sent to a Pemex-run hospital in Villahermosa, the capital of Tabasco. "I was in very bad shape by the time they brought me to the hospital in an ambulance," he said.The doctors diagnosed Morales with pneumonia and put him on oxygen that helped him recover.
 Morales is already expected to return to the rigs as early as June 4 after being evaluated by a doctor. But the seasoned engineer is optimistic. He said that Pemex told him they've increased sanitation measures on platforms and reduced the number of people who can eat together in the mess hall by half - roughly 50 people.
 "I still feel panicked. But I will go back because I love my job," Morales said. "Today I am much better, 90% recuperated, thank God."

CIRCLEVILLE — The Red Cross is asking the public for homemade face coverings to distribute to veterans.
 The Red Cross of Southern and Central Ohio is asking the public to make handmade masks to provide to veterans that will be distributed at the VA medical Centers across the state, including ones in Chillicothe and Columbus.
 “Throughout history, the Red Cross has sought the public’s assistance with projects to help the military and veterans during difficult times,” Matt Riddle, Central and Southern Ohio Region Director, mentioned. “In war time, we asked for socks and helmet liners to be knitted, coverings for casts to be sewn and lap blankets to be crocheted or quilted for injured wheelchair patients. This legacy continues during the current pandemic crisis.”
 The Red Cross is accepting donations at their offices including their office in Chillicothe at 181 North Bridge Street, Chillicothe, Ohio, 45601.
 “Please place completed face coverings in a sealed plastic bag with a note indicating the number of coverings within the bag,” Riddle added. “The face coverings can be mailed via the US Postage Service to the Red Cross Office.”
 The Red Cross said the best masks are the ones the CDC website and they’re asking for expanded sizes.
 “We are particularly looking for face coverings that are sewn, whether by hand or machine,” Riddle concluded.
 In addition to the Red Cross, the Pickaway County Veteran's Service Office has had masks on order for a few weeks but has yet to receive them.
 "We could use some masks for our vans now that we're back to transporting," Margi Pettibone, executive director of the Pickaway County Veteran's Service Office, said. "We are requiring that all drivers and passengers have a face covering."

Up to 75% of patient visits are now being handled by telephone, he said. The centers have not yet established video conferencing for patients, though that is in the works.
 “We talk about how they’re feeling and their medications and come up with a plan,” Storey said. “Do it all over the phone.”
 People with hypertension can usually tell a doctor everything needed as long as they have a blood pressure cuff at home, Storey said. Diabetes patients, though, can be harder to treat without in-person testing.
 Thanks to COVID-19, crowded waiting rooms are no more. When a patient has to visit a center, they are met at the door by a staffer, given a mask if needed, and escorted directly to an examination room, Storey said.

SACRAMENTO -- California, the most populous U.S. state, took another step on Tuesday toward ending sweeping lockdowns imposed to contain the coronavirus pandemic, allowing barber shops and hair salons in most counties to operate for the first time in more than two months.
 On Monday, Governor Gavin Newsom lifted orders that banned church services and in-store retail shopping, although with restrictions in place to prevent further outbreaks of COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the coronavirus.
 "(California) is flattening the curve. Expanding testing. And carefully re- opening businesses," Newsom said on Twitter. "But we MUST continue to take this seriously."
 Although 47 of California's 53 counties have qualified to reopen barber shops and hair salons under the complex formula established by Newsom and health officials, they will remain closed in two of its largest and best-known cities: Los Angeles and San Francisco.
 Statewide nail and brow salons, tattoo shops, gyms, bars and entertainment venues as well as community centers and public pools are still banned from operating.
 Newsom slapped stay-at-home orders on businesses across the state on March 19 as the pandemic began to spread nationwide.
 While lifting the ban on services at places of worship, the governor limited the number of people who can gather at one time to 25 percent of a building's capacity.
 Last week the Trump administration accused Newsom of discrimination by preventing places of worship from meeting while businesses and film studios were allowed to carry on working.
 While clearing the way for shopping at retail stores, the governor required owners to adopt strict cleaning measures and limit the number of shoppers at any given time.
 STOCK EXCHANGE REOPENS
 The New York Stock Exchange opened for the first time in two months, although fewer traders were allowed on the floor and employees were told to wear masks.
 Stocks rallied early in the day on optimism about the development of coronavirus vaccines and a revival of business activity, but gains were trimmed later in the day.
 The New York City suburb of New Rochelle, home to one of the country's earliest coronavirus clusters, believed centered around a synagogue, took the first steps to reopen.
 Twenty U.S. states reported an increase in new cases for the week ending on Sunday as the U.S. death toll nears 100,000. Florida reported a nearly 6 percent increase, while New York registered a double-digit decline.
 New York Governor Andrew Cuomo urged President Donald Trump to invest in major infrastructure projects such as bridges, roads and rail systems to jumpstart the economy as states further relax lockdowns.
 Cuomo, a Democrat who has criticized the Republican president over his handling of the pandemic, will meet with the president in Washington this week.
 "This is one of the things I want to talk to the president about … You want to reopen the economy. Let's do something creative, let's do it fast, let's put Americans back to work," Cuomo said.
 Beaches, fitness centers and hotels in Florida's Broward County, including Fort Lauderdale, got the green light to open on Tuesday with some restrictions.
