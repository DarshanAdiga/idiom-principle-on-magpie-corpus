The Eagles' efforts to get younger and faster comes with the realization that some of those younger players have to actually play, and play well.
   
 That means players drafted from 2017-19 especially have to make meaningful contributions this season.
   
 That's because in many cases they're replacing established veterans. That might even include players drafted this year, especially first-round pick Jalen Reagor, a wide receiver, and fourth-round pick K'Von Wallace, a safety.
   
 And really, if second-round pick Jalen Hurts is going to be the backup quarterback, he'll have to be ready if starter Carson Wentz gets hurt, too. But the Eagles' success hinges more on Wentz staying healthy than Hurts having to contribute.
   
 In some areas, the Eagles can continue to rely on veterans.
   
 That's true in the secondary with Darius Slay at one cornerback spot, and veterans Rodney McLeod, Will Parks and the converted cornerback Jalen Mills at safety.
   
 Here's a look at some of the young players who will have to make a major contribution for the first time, in order for the Eagles' plan to succeed.
   
 Note: We're not including tight end Dallas Goedert and cornerback Avonte Maddox, both drafted in 2018; or defensive end Derek Barnett and linebacker Nathan Gerry, both drafted in 2017. They already have significant roles.
   
 Andre Dillard
   
 The above-mentioned health of Wentz could depend in large part on Dillard, the left tackle who's replacing future Hall of Famer Jason Peters. Dillard, the Eagles' first-round pick in 2019, started three games in place of Peters, and did reasonably well.
   
 But with right tackle Lane Johnson an established Pro Bowl player, it's likely that Dillard will face many of the opponents' top rushers. He might have to handle the likes of Washington rookie Chase Young in the season opener, for example.
   
 There's a chance that Peters could return to the Eagles. The free agent has yet to sign with another team. But it's likely that if Peters does return, it would be as a backup or insurance policy in case Dillard gets hurt or struggles.
   
 J.J. Arcega-Whiteside
   
 Arcega-Whiteside's rookie season was disappointing to say the least, with just 10 catches for 169 yards.
   
 The Eagles seemed to have compensated for the possibility that Arcega- Whiteside, the second-round pick in 2019, might not pan out. They drafted Reagor in the first round, traded for Marquise Goodwin, then drafted John Hightower and Quez Watkins in the fifth and sixth rounds, respectively.
   
 Arcega-Whiteside could have a significant role this season if the Eagles decide to release or trade Alshon Jeffery.
   
 He could also get a chance if DeSean Jackson and/or Goodwin, who have had injury issues the past several seasons, get hurt this season.
   
 Ideally, the Eagles would love for Arcega-Whiteside to play a major role. If he can't, the Eagles likely won't be as patient with him as they were with some other young players, such as ...
   
 Sidney Jones
   
 Eagles general manager Howie Roseman has already gone on record saying that Jones, the Eagles' second-round pick in 2017, is pretty much down to his last chance after three seasons of injuries and inconsistent play.
   
 That was especially true last season when Jones, the Eagles' second-round pick in 2017, made game-saving plays in two games late in the season, yet couldn't get on the field for the playoff game against Seattle.
   
 Jones will have a chance to compete for a starting cornerback job opposite of Slay. It's expected that Maddox will be the main competitor for that spot, with Rasul Douglas, the Eagles' third-round pick in 2017, either moving on or staying as a reserve.
   
 If Jones wins the job, he can expect to see plenty of action as opponents will test him with Slay on the other side.
   
 Josh Sweat
   
 So far, the Eagles haven't signed a veteran pass rusher to rotate in with starters Brandon Graham, who's 32 years old, and 2017 first-round pick Derek Barnett, who has yet to truly have a breakout season.
   
 The Eagles are putting a lot of faith in Sweat, their fourth-round pick in 2018 who had 4 sacks last season. Sweat, along with Genard Avery, should be a part of the rotation at defensive end.
   
 In the past three seasons, the Eagles have had veterans Vinny Curry (last season), Michael Bennett (2018) and Chris Long (2017 and 2018) as rotational pass rushers. There are some veterans still available. But free agent Jadeveon Clowney, as well as Yannick Ngakoue via trade, both would be very costly.
   
 The Eagles are taking a gamble that Sweat and Avery can help out while hoping that Graham and Barnett are productive and healthy.
   
 T.J. Edwards
   
 The Eagles allowed their top two linebackers from last season to leave in Nigel Bradham and Kamu Grugier-Hill.
   
 The Eagles replaced them with a free agent in Jatavis Brown, who started one game last season for the Los Angeles Chargers, along with two draft picks -- Davion Taylor in the third round and Temple's Shaun Bradley in the sixth.
   
 But Taylor is relatively inexperienced, and will likely start out on special teams. And Bradley might also need some time to adjust to the NFL.
   
 Nathan Gerry, the Eagles' fifth-round pick in 2017, became a regular starter last season. That leaves Edwards, whom the Eagles signed as an undrafted free agent last May, as another starter.
   
 Edwards started four games last season, but never played more than 38% of the defensive snaps. He has the opportunity to be one of the two main linebackers.

Last weekend, it was 70 degrees and sunny in Chicago's Hyde Park neighborhood. Families were out with their strollers, university students played Frisbee, and young couples sat in the sun.
   
 You'd have no idea that on Saturday afternoon, Mayor Lori Lightfoot had warned the people ignoring the stay-at-home-order: "We will shut you down, we will cite you, and if we need to, we will arrest you and we will take you to jail."
   
 But, in this, Chicago isn't unique. Across the country, there's a widening gap between authoritarians like Lightfoot and a citizenry with a growing desire to return to normalcy. If we're to reach the light at the end of the tunnel without derailing the train, we must aim for some semblance of balance.
   
 Yet, as armed protesters occupy the Michigan capitol and New York police officers violently enforce social distancing rules, the prospect of balance seems to be escaping us.
   
 The protesters have been characterized as racists and the police as fascists, and everyone's certain that it's their way or the highway to hell. People are frustrated, scared and disgusted.
   
 But there need not be a universal solution for when and how to ease social distancing. As Bret Stephens of the New York Times correctly pointed out, the entire nation doesn't need to operate on the New York City model of pandemic management. With 8 million people living in high density, the lockdown calculus might make sense for New York (although Mayor Bill de Blasio's Jewish funeral crackdown seems cruel). It's absurd, however, to expect those policies to be ideal for every square American mile.
   
 One size doesn't fit all in crisis management. In the same way that a nursing home has reason to be far more careful than a college campus, different jurisdictions and regions have different demographics, infrastructures, challenges and strengths. What's good for the city of Chicago is not necessarily what's best for rural Illinois.
   
 A potential solution, as emphasized by Libertarian presidential hopeful Justin Amash during an interview with ReasonTV, would be to decentralize authority to communities and counties. Counties are an incredible, underused governmental infrastructure, much more capable of responding carefully to the particular needs of its residents.
   
 We can't solve these problems with a club -- we need a scalpel, and county- level decentralization might be able to provide such precision.
   
 But however we go about it, the growing public frustration must be taken seriously. Many citizens are rightly concerned with governmental abuses and job loss. And there's no amount of celebrity videos or feel-good, God-bless- the-nurses content that can keep frustrations from bubbling over. With more than 20 million Americans unemployed, telling us to just "binge Netflix while we sort everything out" is as much a let them eat cake sentiment as one could imagine.
   
 The longer this goes on, and the more paternalistic it gets, the more we'll see pushback and unrest. The anti-government Michigan protesters are not the wacky outliers that some might wish them to be. Grandfathers, new mothers, college students and many others are protesting "stay-at-home" orders every time they go outside for "non-essential" purposes.
   
 If restrictions were significantly loosened, it doesn't mean that anything goes. It's still a bad idea to throw a house party. But you shouldn't be thrown in jail for it.
   
 Widespread frustration and "disobedience" can't be solved by authoritarians cracking skulls for the greater good. This challenge requires the decentralization of authority and de-escalation of violence. Without the former, we cannot hope for the latter.

“I think there should be a blanket start as to when that six-week process or whatever time frame it is to prepare for your season (begins). I think the NCAA should govern that," said Dorrell, the former UCLA coach who took over at Colorado on Feb. 23.
 Whittingham agreed with a uniform start to the season and that all teams should have the same minimum lead time to prepare. He also said he wouldn't want athletes in some states where restrictions have been loosened to be prohibited from taking part in some training and conditioning supervised by coaches.
 “There’s imbalances and inequities all across the board in the NCAA, facility- wise, recruiting bases,” Whittingham said. “Nothing’s equal when you really look at it, and so I would hate to see athletes just sitting around that you could be training and getting ready for the season just because other places aren’t quite yet to that point.”

“I feel the pandemic will be over by the time I get to Tennessee,” said De’Shawn Rucker, a defensive back from Tallahassee, Florida.
 Rucker at least got a chance to visit Tennessee before the pandemic hit. Defensive back Steven Ortiz of Goodyear, Arizona, committed to Minnesota without having seen the campus.
 Ortiz’s father, Steven Ortiz Sr., said his son did get a “virtual tour” of campus from his home.
 “They would show us footage of the facility, then a coach would come and speak to us about the program itself. It was definitely a different experience, but most schools — the facilities, the weightlifting and the cafeterias are all state of the art — so you’re not looking at anything (with) too big of a difference in terms of the facilities,” Ortiz Sr. said.
 Ortiz Sr. said his son got a sense of the culture of Minnesota’s program through conversations with Gophers coach P.J. Fleck. Rucker said he liked Tennessee in part because Jeremy Pruitt was more active than any other head coach in contacting him.
 While some staffs have shown they can draw players from all over the country even during a pandemic, Simmons believes more prospects eventually will decide to stay closer to home.
 Part of the reason is the NCAA instituted a recruiting dead period through May 31, preventing programs from getting an up-close look at out-of-state prospects. No wonder 13 of North Carolina’s 14 verbal commitments are from in- state.
 “A lot of kids, they can drive to your campus, come for games, come for camps, so we’ve gotten to really know these kids,” Brown said. “So if it’s a no- brainer and we really want him, we’re already a year-and-a-half ahead of schools that are out of state that haven’t seen the kids.”
 Simmons predicts there won’t be as many examples of guys going all the way across the country. For example, four of the 247Sports Composite's top nine 2020 prospects from California signed with Alabama, Georgia or Clemson. Maybe more of those players stay in Pac-12 country this time.
 “I think across the board, I would expect a little bit more of a trend of kids staying, not necessarily home, but closer to home,” Simmons said.

Fletcher Cox knows that he's lucky during the coronavirus pandemic because he can isolate at home with all the comforts of a fully-stocked fitness center.
   
 Those perks come with a six-year contract signed in 2016 worth a little more than $100 million, including about $11.2 million this season.
   
 So Cox, the Eagles' perennial Pro Bowl defensive lineman, has been able to stay in shape while he and the rest of his teammates haven't been allowed to attend voluntary spring workouts and practices at the NovaCare Center.
   
 Those spring workouts would have started last month. Organized team activities (OTAs) would have followed next week and lasted through the middle of June.
   
 NFL commissioner Roger Goodell has informed teams to come up with a plan by Friday for gradually reopening their complexes. But there's no timetable set for when players can begin practicing.
   
 So Cox, who's coming off his fifth straight season of being selected to the Pro Bowl, is at his home in Texas.
   
 "I have an actual gym with just about anything that a gym could have," Cox said on a video conference call Tuesday. "I'm able to get there and work out, and do all my normal workouts. I got a place where I can push sleds and pull sleds, and it's keeping me in shape, so I'm pretty blessed to have that stuff."
   
 Cox, like the rest of his teammates, has also been calling in for virtual workouts and instruction with the coaches.
   
 But some of the Eagles don't have the same access to workout equipment that Cox and others do. Cox had some advice for them.
   
 "I tell the guys to drive their car to a flat parking spot and push," Cox said. "I feel that's a way -- push a car. You gotta push somebody (in a real game) for 30-40 seconds (at a time). That's a good way to simulate it."
   
 While the offensive linemen don't weigh quite as much as a car, Cox does have a point.
   
 Either way, Cox said he will be ready for when practices are allowed to take place, whether that's next month, or the start of training camp in late July, or beyond that depending on the coronavirus.
   
 And Cox said he's excited for whenever the season starts after two straight years of having mostly journeymen next to him at tackle because of injuries.
   
 That includes the return to health for Malik Jackson, the Eagles' main free agent signing in 2019 who played just one game last season before needing foot surgery. Cox is looking forward to the arrival of Javon Hargrave, the Eagles' big free agent signing in March.
   
 Last season, Cox was often double-teamed, and he was also coming back from offseason foot surgery. Cox had just 3.5 sacks last year, which was his fewest since 2013 (his second season in the NFL).
   
 "I think the biggest thing is everybody staying healthy, and play the whole season and finish strong," Cox said. "I think the biggest thing for me is I'm more excited about getting everybody together as a group and learning each other, and see the different type of things this group can bring together."
   
 Cox has also grown into a leadership role over the years. That should continue to evolve after the Eagles released safety Malcolm Jenkins and linebacker Nigel Bradham, while left tackle Jason Peters is a free agent.
   
 "For me, I just gotta keep raising the bar," Cox said. "The guys know that I'm a leader, and that I'm there if they need me. I'm not a big rah-rah guy. Maybe (defensive end Brandon Graham) will take over that role. I like to lead by example.
   
 "But I do give speeches sometimes and let the guys know what I'm feeling. I'm obviously more excited about giving more speeches."
   
 Cox understands the possibility that if games are played this season, it could be without fans in the stands, something that he said will be "different," and "weird."
   
 But Cox said he's not going to worry about that.
   
 "You've got to assume it's going to work out," he said. "The only thing I tell myself all the time (is) control what you can control. We will get over this. We'll be fine as long as guys are doing their job, keep working out, stay on top of their diet (and aren't) coming back out of shape, which I know no one will."

INDUSTRIAL – As Cole Brogger walked inside Industrial High School on Tuesday, he knew he was lucky to be there.
 With schools closed and classes being held online, many athletes have had to do their college signings from home.
 Brogger was able to have his moment inside the school’s front lobby.
 “I’m so happy that we were able to get all of this arranged,” Brogger said. “I thought that I wasn’t going to be able to do a signing here so I just appreciate all the coaches and everyone who helped put this all together.”
 Brogger signed with NCAA Division I Lamar University in Beaumont, the same University where both of his parents ran track in their collegiate careers.
 “My parent’s ran there and so that has always been something I’ve thought about,” Brogger said. “I also really liked what the coach had to say about everything, and it’s just an overall good school to go to. I liked the campus and everything else around there too.”
 It was a special moment for Brogger, who had worked towards this throughout his high school career.
 He also was ecstatic about being a Division I athlete.
 “It’s a great feeling,” he said. “That was my goal. I wanted to prove myself enough to go Division I. To be able to go to a good college, run there and compete is everything I could have asked for.”
 Brogger hopes to earn his way into an important spot on the Cardinals team during his fist year on campus. He is slated to run a leg on the mile relay, but will try his best to get more opportunities as well.
 “I want to try and get a starting spot on relays and individual races,” he said. “Hopefully I can help lead us to a conference championship.”
 He was frustrated that he was not able to finish out his senior season but happy knowing he will have another chance to compete in college.
 “I just wanted to run my final season with all my friends,” he said. “I was really looking forward to seeing how far I could go since I was ranked high in the state. For things to stop right when we were about to start district was really disappointing.”
 “I’m just really excited to go out and prove myself,” he added. “I’ve been looking forward to this for about three years now. I’ve been trying to get to this point like my older sister and my dad and others. It’s just a really good feeling knowing that I earned this scholarship and have a college home.”

Apple has begun reopening some retail stores in the United States, marking the first time the tech giant has opened US stores since closing all locations outside of China indefinitely in March.
 The company is beginning with 5 stores in Alabama, Alaska, Idaho, and South Carolina. Apple is encouraging customers to purchase items online when possible, and said that the focus of its open stores will be on providing customer service and support through the Genius Bar.
 Apple also said each store will implement safety procedures that involve social distancing, conduct temperature checks, and require customers to wear face coverings before entering.
 "As local guidance varies around the US there may be slight modifications to our procedures," Apple said in a statement. "As always, our thoughts are with everyone affected by COVID-19 and those working around the clock to treat, study and contain its spread."

This is not _surprising_ information, of course. Rex was a Clone Trooper, the Clones were cloned from Jango Fett, Temuera Morrison played Jango Fett and all the Clones in _Attack of the Clones_ and _Revenge of the Sith_ , and will now reportedly play his clone-son Boba in _The Mandalorian_ ’s second season, to boot. So why _wouldn’t_ Hot Toys’s Captain Rex just, well, look like Temuera Morrison but 12-ish inches tall and made of plastic?

This of course reminded me a bit of Greg Camarillo. For those if you that might not have been around that long there was a time when the Dolphins were worse than we even saw last season. It was a year, a horrible year that saw us celebrate a single overtime win. We claimed Camarillo off of waivers just that September and added him to our very poor roster. Camarillo, for his part stuck around the NFL a bit but had what most would call a very unremarkable career. His career spanned 8 seasons, three with Miami and in those 8 years he only accumulated 1,730 yards off of 146 receptions and only 5 touchdowns. But despite those forgetful numbers its one touchdown that made him a hero for many Dolphins fans. In 2007 Camarillo, in an overtime game against the Baltimore Ravens, took a pass from Cleo Lemon (I know this sounds like it was 5 lifetimes ago) 64 yards for the touchdown sealing the only win for the team that season. There’s plenty we can talk about from that game and that season but the thing that stuck out for everyone was his one big play that will forever make him part of Dolphins lore. Otherwise would many of us remember him as well? I am going to guess no.
