Operation Lift Lockdown May 1st: Make or Break Be There


--DocBreak--
Piper began his tenure in January after defeating two other candidates in an election last fall to replace former long-time mayor Robert Bridges, who decided last year to retire and not seek re-election. Two new city council members were also elected last fall — Gary Venable was elected and took the seat formerly held by Perry Barton, and Tammy Crawley won a four-person race to fill the seat vacated by Eddie Jackson, who stepped down to run for mayor.
 Throughout the campaign, Piper vowed to revamp the city’s operations and has been aggressive in that effort so far. Piper immediately abolished the position of city administrator, fired a city clerk and replaced her with a former city clerk, hired a new city accountant and brought in Ira Underwood as the city’s new police chief following former chief Allan Johnston’s resignation last fall.
 Piper said last week his recommendation to the council that the city move on from Mitchell was “strictly a business decision.”
 “One of my goals, if elected, was that every department head, every employee, every vendor, would be evaluated so that I could be sure the city was getting what the citizens expect and the best bang for the buck, and as a city would make course adjustments as necessary. And that included evaluating the city attorney services,” Piper said. “(Mitchell) did a good job in most cases. This was just an opportunity for a new direction, maybe a new, fresh set of eyes and new ideas. I want to move the city forward, trying to bring some sunlight back into the city and put us back on the map in a good light.”
 Campbell, who is also the city attorney for Arcade and Nicholson in Jackson County, is with Blum & Campbell, LLC, in Peachtree Corners. He earned a bachelor’s degree from Emory University in 2003 and graduated from the University of Georgia School of Law in 2006. He has been a member of the State Bar of Georgia since 2006.
 Campbell was one of three candidates interviewed to replace to Mitchell, and Piper said he and some council members had a favorable opinion of him after observing city council meetings in Nicholson and Arcade.

The dispensary has been operating mostly through curbside pickup the past two weeks, and since they are situated in a stand-alone building versus being located on a busy strip mall, there are “no hindrances,” Erlin said.
 While waiting for “normalcy to come back,” he said Chesapeake Apothecary staff have been making wellness calls to check up on patients and posting updates online.
 With a patient pool of over 5,000, the dispensary’s priority is providing accessibility to patients in their time of need. They serve people with “every diagnosable illness and ailment under the sun,” Erlin said, including post traumatic stress disorder, fibromyalgia, anxiety, depression, cancer, Crohn’s disease, colitis, tremors, Alzheimer’s disease, multiple sclerosis and more.
 Through the versatility and adaptability of the staff, the facility has been able to maintain operations and “manage anxieties,” he said.
 Located off Three Notch Road in Mechanicsville, Southern Maryland Relief, owned by Charlie Mattingly, has changed some of its operating hours and procedures.
 On Monday, Mattingly told The Enterprise the dispensary has been offering curb side pickup and has been taking online orders during the pandemic, although, 50% of their customers are patients over the age of 60, and some are not quite internet savvy and would rather “come in and talk.”
 Patients are still allowed in the store on a limited basis, he said, with only six people allowed in the waiting room at one time and three in the showroom where sales take place, which usually can serve up to seven people at once. Mattingly said a security guard stands by the entrance of the store and hands every person walking in a pair of gloves, which are disposed of at the end of the visit. Masks are also provided to patients who don’t have one.
 “We sanitize every 30 minutes … we’re doing more than what was asked. It’s better to be safe than sorry,” he said.
 Mattingly, too, has a concern with supply and demand, he said, as business has increased about 40% since the pandemic began. “I wouldn’t say people are panic buying but they are stocking up on certain varieties” that work for their treatment plan.
 His concern lies in the possibility of not being able to provide a patient with the specific strain or product they’re used to, which would mean they would have to start over as far as finding out what works best for them.
 “Medical cannabis is one of the greatest things … it changes people’s lives,” he said. It treats an endless number of conditions and “really helps lift depression,” especially now that people are going “stir crazy.”
 He said some people have begun reaching out to him and asking questions about how medical cannabis might benefit them. “At the end of the day, I think when the smoke clears, this is helping people understand what is available,” the owner said, and is helping rid the community of the negative stigma that comes along with the use of medical cannabis.
 Last week, it was reported 33 states allow for some form of sale and consumption of marijuana and of those, more than 20 states have designated the cannabis industry as essential during the coronavirus outbreak.

The 3.0 liter turbocharged inline-six (B58) powering the BMW M440i makes 374 hp and 369 lb-ft of torque in European-spec (should be 382 hp in North America) and it helps the BMW M440i get a move on. In this video, we get to see it accelerate from a stand still, see its gauge cluster as it does so and also see the affects of the new "e-boost" system. The M440i is actually a mild-hybrid (MHEV), as it has a 48-volt system with a generator-starter. The latter is effectively just a small electric motor that can add a few extra ponies to the engine during low rpm, low turbo-boost driving.

Turning out of the current situation, I'd like to take a few minutes to go deeper on how COVID-19 has affected our operations and what we've done to respond. As the situation evolved over the past couple of months, we focused first on the safety of our associates. In March, we took steps to quickly shift over 50,000 of our associates to work from home and now have approximately 98% of our workforce working remotely in a secured manner. In doing so, we leveraged our previous investments in business resiliency and in addition we ordered thousands of laptops, expanded remote access capacity provided at home internet and for those critical personnel that needed to work onsite, we took steps to ensure their safety while they perform those essential onsite tasks. This was a huge undertaking by our global IT, security and legal, and HR organizations and I'm extremely proud of their execution.

After reading that, you’ll probably send me some 30-minute YouTube video (that I’ve already seen) explaining how totems can be understood not as a physical object but actually as the presence of a type of psychological alienation, and that as soon as that alienation is resolved the facticity of the world doesn’t matter so long as the individual can believe it as real or some bullshit like that. You’d cite some philosophers, saying that the irrelevance of the facticity of the world mirrors William James’ argument in his lecture “The Will to Believe.” “See!” you’ll say with the unnerving confidence and frenzy of a Q-Anon believer, “Nolan was a genius all along!” But “Inception” is so complicated, so engorged on its own largesse, that you could probably set up any number of explanations for what it means. The explanation that I came up with as a way to make fun of other explanations actually makes sense — read “The Will to Believe” and you’ll see what I’m talking about. “Inception” doesn’t have an actual argument about reality or ontology, and if it does, it’s a bad one because it’s so obscured by the plot-devices that Nolan uses to set it up.

But such is the power of enchantment that the girl didn’t question her, led her up a long stairway into a room of such green light as to leave her blinking. There were palms and figs, creepers spilling from their planters, climbing vines and profusions of mosses pressing wetly against their glass enclosures. And ferns, ferns everywhere, suspended from the ceiling, crowding the windowsills, cases upon cases. The maid departed, but  Elizabeth  didn’t even notice. Now, flushed, still breathless from her haste, she drifted through the plants as if dreaming, the words of the monthly intoning like a hymn. _Adiantum, Aspidium, Asplenium_. . . The narrow path seemed to lead deeper within the grove, until at last she stopped before a great capsule, set on a table and towering nearly two feet above her head. Condensation on the inside of the glass caught the chandelier light, illuminating an explosion of ferns, dark green and emerald, with pale lime stalks curling from their hearts. And in the center of the tableau, and rising from a stone above the rest: a species she had never seen before, frilled, fimbriate, the end of its fronds fine to translucence, its lace hairs glistening with drops of water. Despite the glass that separated her from the plants, she could taste the moisture in the air.

So, again, we will have to take a view where they would like to go for a longer period for right execution, going for a shorter period at a different rate. But I'm afraid where the market is today and bear in mind that there have been no other recent deals or pictures for that size for those type of new buildings. I'm afraid I cannot predict.

“When you take a broad look at the data over the last two weeks, we’ve shown that we can flatten the curve and control the spread of this virus through kinds of social distancing measures that we’ve implemented – but we are not out of the woods yet,” Governor Lamont said. “When it comes creating an action plan on the steps we should take next, our primary objective needs to focus on not causing any harm to the progress we have made so far, otherwise our infection and hospitalization rates will go right back up.

Galaxy Fold 2 sale price
 As for the price? There's no consensus among leakers yet, but you can bet that a smaller storage configuration that runs on 4G would cost less than a 5G version with more on-board storage space. It'd be surprising to see a more advanced Galaxy Fold 2 come in at less than the original Galaxy Fold's $1,980 asking price, though with a global recession in the offing, all things are possible.
 Trade-in deals, bundles and freebies are more likely than an immediate reduction in cost. Although Samsung has been known to cut prices a few months after a launch, at least on its own website (like this Galaxy S20 price drop), the brand usually prefers to bump up the value of its premium products with bundled deals instead, like a buy-one-get-one or a free set of earbuds.
 We'll keep an eye and an ear out for new and credible Galaxy Fold 2 rumors. In the meantime, here's every phone that we know of for 2020, eight apps to vastly improve your phone photography and a good look at the OnePlus 8 Pro phone that wants to take down the Galaxy S20.

How do you do, fellow kids? It's me, your girl Courtney. I am to understand turnips are all the rage today and as a lover of a good root vegetable I am thrilled. I have never played your _Animal Crossing_ on the Switch machine but I have a pretty good grasp on the turnips. The turnips are the currency in the adorable dystopia, stocks that rise and fall at the whim of The Capitalist Raccoon. But they are also so much more!

Another whinny, this equine, and bearing down beneath a whip. She swept her son up and carried him out of the black cloud and through the nearest door, into a tavern, where for the next half hour, beneath a lurid painting of gambling monkeys in cuffs and pirate hats, William slowly, very slowly, regained his breath.

Departments across Michigan have changed how they schedule their personnel to limit officer's exposure to the disease, including the Saginaw County Sheriff's Department and the Saginaw Township Police Department. Typically, police will work a few 12-hour shifts and then have a few days off. Many departments are now enacting a rotating seven-day-on, 14-day-off schedule.

In response, AMC vowed not to show Universal movies, NATO released its own statement condemning the decision. Universal fired back and accused NATO and AMC of coordinating their statements and misrepresenting their viewpoint, which is actually to only release some movies OnDemand. Now not surprisingly, Regal is taking the side of AMC and NATO, though it’s important to note there is a difference in the statements. AMC has promised not to show any upcoming Universal movies. Regal is promising not to show any movies that violate the theatrical window. So, it seems like, in theory, if Universal agrees to a theatrical window for certain movies, it would show them.

At last, it was time for the examination, and William was called over, asked to undress before a lantern. He was shaking; he, too, recalled the blistering. She drew him to her, stroking his hair, whispering promises that no one would hurt him, never again. She expected the doctor to scold her, but Forbes only smiled gently, without showing his teeth. When they were ready, he began with William’s eyes and nose and mouth, his skin and hair, his nails, pausing only to note faint areas of rash. When at last one of the apprentices removed the stethoscope from its bag, he passed it to his master with the air of handing a scepter to a king. Forbes took it without ceremony, without a glance. It was a wooden tube, burnished with the craftsmanship of an oboe, half the length of those of Watts and Moss and Underwood, which now seemed to have been designed to keep their patients at a distance. As Forbes listened, his head was so close to William that wisps of the doctor’s white hair brushed against the boy’s chest. It tickled. For the first time, William smiled, then let out a nervous giggle, which Forbes silenced with a touch.

Ute Christin, a newborn photographer based out of Connecticut went to grab takeout from a restaurant two weeks back and saw that everyone there was worried about the future of their restaurant. The number of people coming to the restaurant had significantly dropped and they asked her to spread the word that they are still in business. And since then she's been brainstorming for an idea to help get some attention to these local restaurants.

PORTLAND, Maine — Last year, restaurants and bars all over Maine took part in Seaweed Week. Chefs created food courses and drinks that contained seaweed, serving them up to those who may not have known how edible the plant was.
 This year's week-long event was shaping up to be the biggest yet; instead, organizer's like Heritage Seaweed owner, Josh Rogers, had to pivot. "We still have a few restaurants that are doing take-out. There are some makers around the state, so Fogtown Brewing has a seaweed beer; Bixby & Co. made chocolate bonbons that you can get from them; there's a cheese; there's a seaweed kombucha; there's even a seaweed whiskey, so there are some products on the marketplace that would not otherwise be there."

“Even if we had the money (to acquire the buses), we couldn’t get that many drivers trained and ready to go in time,” Greene said, adding that, under a three-tier scenario considered, the elementary school days wouldn’t start until 9:30 a.m. and not end until 4 p.m.
 Board opinion on the two scenarios was mixed Tuesday.
 Board members Bill Ritter and Garey Huff said the board should avoid flipping start times right now amid the several facets of uncertainty generated by the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.
 “We’re going through unprecedented times,” Ritter said. “I think it’s important to have as little of an impact on the community with this as we can right now.”
 Board member Rickey Bailey said he would favor the option that flips the starting times because district officials identified fewer “cons” that it presented than the other option.
 Also at Tuesday’s meeting, which will be streamed live on the district’s YouTube page, the board will hear more from BASA principal Dale Simpson on his thoughts about a shorter day at the new high school versus a longer one.
 Greene and superintendent Chris McMichael said Simpson favors a longer day and would provide the board with ideas on how he would utilize the extra time.
 Greene and McMichael said while there are no plans for a survey to be put out, the district wants feedback from the public on the proposed scenarios. Greene said there was “sharp division” among the task force committee over which one members preferred.
 “The committee will meet again before the (school board’s) May work session and will try to take the public feedback and make as many adjustments as we can to make the scenarios more palatable,” Greene said.
 Board chair Lynn Stevens said she wanted to hear public feedback as well but stressed that it will ultimately be a board decision.
 “At the end of the day, this is why we get paid the big bucks,” Stevens said.

The phone world is in a weird place, with coronavirus quarantines and lockdowns causing phone sales to plunge by 38% by February compared to last year. Some companies are soldiering through to launch phones online, like Apple's new iPhone SE and the OnePlus 8 and 8 Pro. But with factories prone to close any time if cases of COVID-19 spike, the timing of possible new phones, like the Galaxy Fold 2 and Galaxy Note 20, are up in the air.
 Still, the Galaxy Fold 2 rumors are heating up. The very extravagance of another pricy foldable phone could be what perks our ears and raises eyebrows at a time when companies, including Samsung, seem to be falling back to cheaper devices, like the $400 Galaxy A51 on sale now.
 Here we present the most important Galaxy Fold 2 speculations to date. Keep in mind that this story will update frequently with new rumors, and that Samsung hasn't officially announced plans to make a Galaxy Fold 2. If the phone does launch, it would be Samsung's third foldable design, after the original Galaxy Fold and the smaller, cheaper Galaxy Z Flip.

When the coronavirus first started to spread across the U.S., back before schools had shuttered and before we were told to stay at home, my then 4-year- old daughter looked at me one evening after overhearing the evening news on TV.
 Her lip quivered and her eyes filled with tears.
 "Mommy, am I going to get that virus?" she asked.
 I assured my kids that no, the virus never makes kids very sick and that it's only the very old people or people with health problems that get seriously ill. While we still need to wash our hands and be careful about symptoms, I assured my kids that everything was going to be fine. I told them that life as we know it would continue.
 Looking back, only two months ago, I had no idea that we would be where we are today. If only things were as simple as washing hands.
 Things hit home for me in late March, when, while texting an old friend in the New York City area about the difficulties of trying to work from home while homeschooling the kids, she told me her 10-year-old son was sick. It was COVID-19. Because of the onslaught of the virus, it was almost impossible to find any kind of disinfectant, masks or gloves. The family had been staying home, much like we all are, and yet their son still got sick.
 My kids started praying for the boy every night. I had some masks, extra Lysol wipes and hand sanitizer that I had bought back in February, and we packed them up, along with candy and homemade get-well cards that my kids made, and shipped the box to Brooklyn. Thankfully, the boy's symptoms were fairly mild, and after two weeks, the fever dissipated and he recovered.
 But not every child has been so lucky.
 Last week, 5-year-old Skylar Herbert in Michigan became the first child in the U.S. to die of COVID-19. Like so many other girls her age, like my own 5-year- old daughter - she loved dressing up and performing and loved all things "bling." A kindergartner, she loved going to school and began reading when she was only 4.
 But last month she started complaining of headaches, the Washington Post reported. And within days she was hospitalized with COVID-19. She developed a rare form of meningitis, suffered from brain swelling and eventually was put on a ventilator to help her breathe. She did not survive.
 She did not have any underlying health conditions.
 The majority of the COVID-19 deaths in the U.S. have been people who are over age 60 or people who have underlying health conditions. But there have also been critical cases among the young and people without underlying health conditions who have also ended up on ventilators and some who have died.
 According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there were 21,050 COVID-19 deaths as of April 22. Three of the deaths were in children age 14 and younger, 21 deaths in people age 24 and younger, and 585 of the people who died were between 25 and 44.
 There is no sure way of knowing how many people ended up on a ventilator and survived, or how many people have actually had the virus. Without widespread testing, we won't really know how many people have antibodies or how many people have the virus but are asymptomatic.
 In the last couple of weeks, people have protested across the country, saying that businesses should re-open and stay-at-home orders should be lifted for the sake of the economy and their personal rights to do business as they please. While states like Georgia have started to lift their business closures, despite not yet reaching a peak on COVID-19 cases, Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey announced last week that she will not lift the statewide stay-at-home order yet.
 When she lifts the restrictions, Ivey said the decision will be based on data. Currently, the state is testing about 1% of the population for COVID-19, and Alabama doesn't have enough information right now about the number of cases out there to lift the stay-at-home order, Ivey said.
 For that, I applaud her. I understand the need to reopen the economy and get back to a somewhat normal life. I look forward to the day when I can go back to work and my kids can go back to school. But until we are able to conduct widespread testing to know who for sure has the virus and how many people may be immune, we don't need to rush reopening business as usual, just for the sake of it.
 Lives matter, lives like little Skylar Herbert. Lives like my kids', my husband's, our parents, my neighbors - lives like yours. Right now, without a clearer picture of cases, it's too much to risk.
