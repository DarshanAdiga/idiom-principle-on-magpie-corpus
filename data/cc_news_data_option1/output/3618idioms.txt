I’m angry this morning. I just found out Rebecca Dow’s campaign signs have been vandalized. It makes me angry that Rebecca Dow, our congresswoman, would be victim to vile and obscene words. You should know Mrs. Dow has been one of very few that has stepped up for our veterans and our Veterans’ Home. She has also given her full support to achieving the reality of a Veterans’ Outreach Center in T-or-C. I immediately could sense that she shared the same vision for our vets that I did.


  And that vision is pretty straight-forward. Every single person needs a friend. Veterans in our community need a place where they can find the camaraderie, the companionship, the friendship they experienced in the military. Being a member of the armed forces created an unbreakable bond. If a fellow soldier next to me fell to the ground before the finish line, someone would extend a hand and lift him up. A soldier having difficulty completing a task on time would find help from others. Being in the military meant becoming part of an unbreakable bond. You could count on others to be your brother or sister’s keeper.


  Leaving the military for civilian life meant raising a family, working full- time, being occupied and busy for 30 years. Many veterans, after living a fractured and hectic life, hit the end high and dry. They haven’t dealt with PTSD; they’ve lost track of buddies from boot camp; they no longer are part of an indelible bond.

Four cities in Kansas have submitted proposals to be the future home of U.S. Space Command the headquarters of the newest branch of the military, the Space Force.


   


  The Topeka Capital-Journal's Titus Wu reported last week that those cities are Derby, Kansas City, Leavenworth and Wichita.


   


  Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly seems to think the Sunflower State has a shot at it, too. She's even directed her cabinet to use all the resources necessary to make make that selection a reality.


   


  "Our strong teams of state and local economic development professionals have the tools available for the attraction, growth and retention of the U.S. Space Command headquarters," said the governor in a news release. "Kansas is the perfect place for this facility, and we are prepared to do the work to get it here."


   


  We agree with the governor's assessment. Kansas has a lot to offer this fledgling military force.


   


  Kansas has a strong record of military service. We're the state that produced Eisenhower. Our military bases -- Fort Riley, Fort Leavenworth and McConnell Air Force Base -- are known for their strong support from the surronding communities.


   


  Our state's motto, "Ad Astra Per Aspera," which means "To the stars through difficulties," shows we can handle this.


   


  President Trump and his administration should seriously consider building the headquarters on the Kansas prairie. There's plenty of reasons why.


   


  Wichita is known for its strong aviation industry ties. With McConnell already in town, perhaps the government could save some money building a new site by instead renovating or retrofitting the base. Think of something Joint Base Andrews or Joint Base Lewis-McChord.


   


  Wu reported Leavenworth city and county invested about $10 million in a shovel-ready business and technology park consisting of 80 acres. Leavenworth has strong community ties to the Army, but they'd welcome the Space Force just the same.


   


  Kansas City and Derby would also be excellent options. Both are part of large metropolitan areas with strong infrastructures. Both have strong industrial presence in state.


   


  These assets would allow the Space Force to essentially come into to a turn- key place and set up shop knowing they have a community ready to support them as needed.


   


  Essentially what we're saying is Kansans are leaders in the aerospace industry, we're military friendly and familiar, and we're ready for the challenge the Space Force will bring.


   


  All we need is the Trump administration to sign on, then it's "Ad Astra Per Aspera," friends.

The devastated parents of Lukas Orda, who went missing from a cattle ship in the East China Sea, have pleaded with the Australian government not to give up the search for their son.
 The Queensland vet and NSW man Will Mainprize were among a crew of 43 on board Gulf Livestock 1 when it capsized in a storm off the coast Japan last week.
 Ulrich Orda says his family was shocked to learn the search for his son had been scaled back by Japan's Coast Guard, but the federal government was quick to provide reassurances.
 Deputy Prime Minister Michael McCormack and Foreign Minister Marise Payne noted the distress of family and friends and said the government was working closely with Japanese authorities.
 "Japan's Coast Guard has advised the Australian embassy in Tokyo and the Australian consulate-general in Osaka that wide area surveillance by air and sea continues," a joint ministerial statement read.
 "Australia is encouraging Japan's ongoing air and sea efforts, and continues to offer the Japanese authorities any supporting capability needed. Japan's Coast Guard has assured Australia it will not give up its search for those missing."
 Two survivors have been rescued and another crew member died in hospital after being found floating unconscious on September 4.
 Rescue efforts have been hampered by powerful storms.
 The ship had sent a distress call on September 2, while it was sailing in rough seas as a typhoon passed the area.
 The Gulf Livestock 1 left New Zealand in mid-August carrying 5800 cows to Tangshan on China's eastern coast. New Zealand temporarily suspended new approvals for exporting live cows after the ship's sinking.
 The ship stalled when an engine stopped then tipped on its side and sank after being hit by a powerful wave.
 The crew included 39 from the Philippines, the two Australian men and two New Zealanders.
 Standing alongside his wife Sabine on Friday, Mr Orda thanked the Australian government for its support and asked that search efforts continue.
 He said one of the survivors told investigators the crew were all wearing life jackets and readying to leave on life rafts.
 "Given this information we are extremely concerned about the search being suspended or called off, especially since the people who were on the vessel were still at sea," Mr Orda said.
 Rescuers have seen dozens of cows carcasses, an empty raft, a life vest carrying the ship's name and a bundle of rope floating in the area. They also found traces of fuel in the water - a sign of the ship's submersion.

JOHANNESBURG (AP) — Paul Rusesabagina sounded strained. The man who inspired the film “Hotel Rwanda” for saving people from genocide but is now accused of terrorism in Rwanda was speaking to his family for the first time since being paraded in handcuffs on Aug. 31. But something was wrong.With Rwandan authorities listening in, it was clear Rusesabagina wasn’t allowed to speak openly on the phone call, said Brian Endless, part of the international team trying to defend him.It remains a mystery how Rusesabagina disappeared from a trip to Dubai late last month and appeared in custody in a country his family says he would never return to voluntarily.“Paul briefly mentioned boarding a plane on the call, but this was strained and he cut off the discussion immediately after. We have no idea if this was Paul speaking freely or coerced,” Endless told The Associated Press. In comments to the BBC, he said Rusesabagina mentioned waking up on the plane to find himself in Rwanda’s capital, Kigali.Endless said Rwandan officials also attended a meeting between Belgian officials and Rusesabagina, a Belgian citizen and U.S. permanent resident.The uncertainties around his arrest have led Human Rights Watch to assert that the 66-year-old Rusesabagina, long an outspoken critic of the Rwandan government, was “forcibly disappeared.” In a statement released late Thursday, the organization said Rwandan authorities should urgently explain how he was apprehended and taken to the East African country.“The fact that Rwanda did not pursue Rusesabagina through lawful extradition proceedings suggests the authorities do not believe their evidence or fair trial guarantees would stand up to scrutiny before an independent tribunal, and so opted to circumvent the rule of law,” the group’s Central Africa director, Lewis Mudge, said.Rusesabagina’s legal team, which has not been able to speak with him, believes he boarded a private plane operated by GainJet, which has been used by the Rwandan government and has an office in the capital, Kigali. The legal team points to publicly available flight records.It is not clear what the flight plan or passenger list say, and GainJet’s CEO Ramsey Shaban has not responded to a request for comment. Authorities in the United Arab Emirates, home of the Dubai city-state, have not responded to questions.Human Rights Watch asserted that “Rusesabagina was in the custody of the Rwandans or their proxies as of the night of Aug. 27 but his detention was not acknowledged by the Rwandans until Aug. 31.”Rwandan President Paul Kagame in a nationally televised interview Sunday indicated that Rusesabagina might have been tricked into boarding a plane to a country he hasn’t lived in since 1996. “It was actually flawless!” Kagame said, suggesting that “he brought himself — even if he may not have intended it.”Rusesabagina became famous for protecting more than 1,000 people as a hotel manager during Rwanda’s 1994 genocide in which some 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus were killed. For his efforts he was awarded the U.S. Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2005.But Rwandan authorities accuse him of supporting the armed wing of his opposition political platform, which has claimed responsibility for deadly attacks inside Rwanda. They point to a video posted online in 2018 in which he expresses support for the National Liberation Front and says “the time has come for us to use any means possible to bring about change in Rwanda, as all political means have been tried and failed.”Rusesabagina in the past has denied funding rebel groups and said he was being targeted over his criticism of Kagame’s government and alleged rights abuses.Rwanda’s government has changed its account of Rusesabagina’s arrest and has not allowed him access to legal counsel of his choosing or any confidential consultations, Human Rights Watch said. The group for years has documented cases of critics of Rwanda’s government being killed overseas, apprehended under unclear circumstances or dying behind bars.“In Rwanda, history over the past 20-plus years shows that there is unfortunately a wide variety of things that the Rwandan government can do beyond prison,” said Endless, a U.S.-based professor. “We are very concerned that Paul could be disappeared at any time or could suffer a health crisis manufactured by the Rwandan government.”Rwanda’s government has long denied alleged abuses, and its supporters point to the country’s widely praised development and stability since the genocide.Rusesabagina has not appeared in court. His file was handed over to prosecutors on Wednesday. Rwandan law says a suspect can be in provisional detention for 15 days, renewable for up to 90 days.Rwanda’s prosecutor general, Aimable Havugiyaremye, told the AP that Rusesabagina is still being interrogated and a court date is yet to be announced.Rusesabagina’s legal team has filed a complaint with the United Nations special rapporteur on torture, and the office is “moving forward with their procedures,” Endless said. The office told the AP it could not comment.___Ignatius Ssuuna in Kigali, Rwanda, contributed.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The world we currently find ourselves in is a weird one to say the least. Somehow Biff from Back to the Future became president in the real future while our economy stays largely stuck in the past, dependent on fossil fuels and 19th-century technologies...sorry kid, no garbage-fueled, flying Deloreans yet.
   
 Add to that a pandemic that has altered or shut down much of the globe, and it can feel like we're living in some kind of alternate universe, or a comic book setting like DC's Bizarro World oft-referenced in Seinfeld. Nostradamus couldn't have predicted this on his best day.
   
 As if this all wasn't strange enough, one of the few remaining bastions of consistency -- a standby classic providing a sense of normalcy, and when needed, the bitter truth -- continues in unexpected and uncertain directions. I refer to that glorious beer style, lauded for its piney, dank character, and defined by its bitter hop bite (or IBU count) -- the India Pale Ale.
   
 Remember IBUs (International Bitterness Units), the once glorified scale approximating bitterness in beer for around 100 years, and so intertwined with the IPA that brewers at one time were determined to create as bitter and IBU- laden a version as the human tongue could taste?
   
 Things sure do change. Most of today's IPAs are almost unrecognizable from the bitter original -- many sweet fermentations are closer to orange juice or soda than what one would expect of beer. This curious shift in style actually created a sub-style called the New England IPA, which takes the classic West Coast IPA, initially inspired by the original bitter British IPA, and flips it on its head, approaching IBUs like a dirty word. Within both IPA categories there are even sub-styles, further muddying the water.
   
 The juicier, sweeter IPA's have brought many more people into the IPA fold, but unfortunately, it has homogenized the beer market, and one could argue, bastardized the style by reframing bitterness as unwanted. Experimentation and innovation are exciting for the brewer and beer aficionado, but it is important to remember that the genius of most great beers is the balance it can achieve between malt sweetness and hop bitterness -- kind of the whole point to using those two ingredients together (in most cases).
   
 If you're like me and pining for an IPA that pays respect to historical roots or simply miss IBUs in your beer you are in luck. From the company that first introduced a year-round Double IPA comes Stone Brewing's Ruined Again, a Triple IPA brewed with the same ingredients as their infamous Ruination, but even more malt and hops.
   
 Ruined Again will take your palate close to the pinnacle of IPA-dom with a gigantic 10.8% ABV and an unabashed 100+ IBUs. Thankfully, Stone has not forgotten their calling.
   
 This week's recommendation: Stone Brewing Ruined Again Triple IPA, a big, bitter, boozy IPA brewed with Magnum, Centennial, and Citra hops for bitter, tropical, dank tasting notes. 10.8% ABV. Escondido, California.

Thompson said students found it difficult to keep up with 7 classes in the remote setting and ended up dropping some classes.


  The decision was made to switch to the block schedules as a way of decreasing the class load should remote learning become necessary this year.


  With a block schedule Thompson said, students will spend double the class time in each subject area, and will earn a credit for a full-year’s worth of learning in a single semester.


  Students will be able to earn the same number of credits they would in a regular seven period schedule for the year.


  The move to a block schedule has been a subject of discussion for a couple of years among teachers Thompson said, so a lot of information had already been gathered when the time came to make plans for the 2020-2021 school year.


  During the first and last hour of the day, “skinny” classes of 50 minutes meet. Some of these are college level courses offered through Colorado Mountain College, which has its own schedule for live and online classes.


  The new schedule gives students the opportunity to earn 8 credits in a year instead of the usual 7 and opens up opportunities for students to investigate more elective and CMC classes.


  Thompson said implementing the block schedule is new and has been done “from scratch” and adjustments are being made, but so far she thinks it is running smoothly.


  The initial feedback from teachers and students has been positive overall, and everyone is adjusting, she said.


  “I know this is a big change for everyone involved,” Thompson said, “Change is never easy. I hope this is the best for students in the long run.”

E’ un cambio di passo per il nostro Paese che ha un carattere di universalità. L’assegno unico è rivolto a tutti i bambini, poi ci sarà una parte maggiorata, progressiva in base al reddito del nucleo familiare. E’ un elemento unificante e in quanto tale è un input dal punto di vista demografico».

For some, particularly those who are a racial or ethnic minority, say the protests have sparked a long-overdue awakening to systemic injustice.

REYNOLDSVILLE — Boy Scout Troop 72 recognized Eagle Scout Joseph Griffin, who met the requirements for the Eagle rank, with an Eagle Court of Honor on Aug. 29. The Troop 72 Eagle Court of Honor was held at the First Baptist Church in Reynoldsville.


  He is the son of Joseph Griffin and Jamie Dixon.


  Assistant Senior Patrol Leader Colton Yohe called the Eagle Court of Honor to order. Kellen Gibson and Tyler Hoyt served as the color guard. Troop 72 Scoutmaster Dave Corbeil was the Master of Ceremony. Chaplain’s Aide Aiden Via delivered the invocation and blessing for the event.


  Master of Ceremony Dave Corbeil and Assistant Scoutmaster Zach Garman reviewed the path to Eagle and the contributions Griffin has made to Troop 72, his school, the community and the Boy Scouts of America.


  While the Trail to Eagle was reviewed, Hoyt lighted a candle for each rank and placed a rose in a vase for each rank. Griffin held several leadership positions, including serving as Senior Patrol Leader and Quartermaster as a Scout in Troop 72. He also participated in troop activities including Troop 72”s trip to Niagara Falls in 2019 and the 80-mile kayak trip on the West Branch of the Susquehanna in 2020. Also, Griffin has been active in school, church, and community activities.


  Griffin accomplished his Eagle service project by erecting dog cleanup stations near the athletic fields in Reynoldsville. His Eagle Board of Review consisted of Brad Sweet, scoutmaster of Troop 26, Scott Creighton, and Kathy Matts, Bucktail Council Advancement Committee chairperson. Corbeil affirmed that Eagle Griffin satisfied all requirements for the rank of Eagle.


  Griffin’s sister Julie read the “Legend of the Rose” while Joseph gathered the seven roses that were used in the candle lighting and presented the roses to his mother.


  Eagle Scout Jacob Weber administered the Eagle Pledge to Griffin. Then Assistant Scoutmasters Garman and Michael Via dressed Griffin in his Eagle neckerchief and distributed the Eagle awards. In turn, Griffin pinned the father’s pin on his father and the Eagle mother’s pin on his mother. Griffin then recognized his stepfather as his Eagle mentor.


  Zach Ankeny from state Rep. Chris Dush’s office, 66th Legislative District in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, presented remarks and gave Griffin a commendation from the Pennsylvania House of Representatives. A variety of other commendations were also presented.


  Chaplain’s Aide Via provided a blessing on the Eagle Court of Honor and on the refreshments that were served following the ceremony. Assistant Senior Patrol Leader Colton Yohe closed the Eagle Court of Honor by directing the Color Guard to retire the colors. Congratulations, photographs and refreshments followed.

“In our county of Wicklow there 42 schools with classes greater than 30 pupils. These figures are shocking.      “Sinn Féin wants to abolish all classes of over 30 kids and never allow them to return, and work towards attaining an EU average of 20 children per class.      “We want an immediate audit of school buildings to be undertaken, which identifies those schools that are struggling most to comply with social distancing and that require additional space.      “We commit to a fund of €300m, which will be used to create additional space for schools that need it the most.      “Keeping the virus out of schools, and keeping schools open, also means supporting parents to do the right thing and keep symptomatic children at home.      “An assurance is needed that parents who must stay at home with their child are not out of pocket for doing so. We propose the expansion of force majeure leave to allow parents to take paid time off to look after children isolating.      "School children and staff who are symptomatic must be given priority for rapid testing, so that staff can return to work, and children can return to school rapidly.      “Existing educational disadvantages have come to the fore during the pandemic. Children with special educational needs are the cohort who have missed out the most.      “We are concerned that special educational teachers will be pulled from pillar to post to cover absences, breaks and remote learning. We want to recruit 500 additional SNAs, to ensure that no child loses out.      “Finally, the bus fleet must increase so that whilst social distancing and safer transport of the 120,000 children who take part in the School Transport Scheme can be ensured, this does not come at the cost of some losing their seat on a school bus.      “Keeping our schools open is essential, and Sinn Féin wants to be constructive. With the policies contained in our ‘Keeping Schools Open’ document, coupled with adequate funding and supports, we can ensure that schools are in a position where they can remain open now and into the future.”

Facebook Inc. pronto permitirá a los estudiantes universitarios crear perfiles especiales específicamente para conectarse con compañeros de clase y unirse a eventos y grupos de sus campus, una especie de regreso a los primeros días de la compañía, cuando Facebook era exclusivo para estudiantes universitarios después de que el director ejecutivo, Mark Zuckerberg, fundara la red social en su dormitorio de Harvard. El nuevo producto, llamado Facebook Campus, será parte del servicio existente de la compañía, pero los usuarios deben crear un perfil especial usando la dirección de correo electrónico de su universidad. El perfil será visible solo para otros estudiantes de su universidad y los estudiantes podrán unirse a grupos, encontrar eventos en el campus y participar en discusiones en el aula. La idea es brindar a los estudiantes un “espacio privado y dedicado para interactuar con su vida universitaria”, dijo Charmaine Hung, gerenta de productos de Facebook que supervisa la iniciativa. Los perfiles pueden incluir información como la especialización de un estudiante, en qué dormitorio vive y qué clases está tomando. “Queríamos permitir que las personas agreguen información relacionada con su universidad específica que no necesariamente deseen incluir en su perfil principal de Facebook”, agregó. Hung dijo que el producto de Facebook ayudará a los estudiantes que no viven en la escuela a mantenerse conectados con sus compañeros de clase y otras personas en las muchas facultades y universidades que utilizan el aprendizaje remoto a tiempo completo o parcial para protegerse contra la propagación del COVID-19. El producto se lanzará a partir del jueves en 30 facultades y universidades, incluidas la Universidad de Duke, la Universidad Northwestern y Virgina Tech. A medida que Facebook se ha vuelto más grande y ha agregado funciones, la compañía también ha estado presionando a los usuarios hacia formas más íntimas de compartir, incluidos grupos privados y mensajería. Cuando Facebook lanzó en setiembre pasado una función de citas en Estados Unidos, pidió a los usuarios que crearan perfiles específicos para citas como una forma de mantener su vida amorosa separada de su red más amplia de Facebook. Campus funciona de manera similar. “La gente está buscando un espacio para conectarse en torno a intereses que son más reducidos que todo su círculo de amigos de Facebook”, agregó Hung. Es posible que Facebook Campus también ayude a la empresa a mantenerse vigente entre los usuarios en edad universitaria. La popularidad de la red entre los adolescentes ha disminuido en los últimos años, aunque el servicio de intercambio de fotos Instagram de la compañía ha mantenido un gran número de seguidores entre los jóvenes. Actualmente, Instagram no está involucrado en Facebook Campus, dijo Hung, pero podría incluirse de alguna manera en el futuro.

 The world we currently find ourselves in is a weird one to say the least. Somehow Biff from Back to the Future became president in the real future while our economy stays largely stuck in the past, dependent on fossil fuels and 19th-century technologies...sorry kid, no garbage-fueled, flying Deloreans yet.
 Add to that a pandemic that has altered or shut down much of the globe, and it can feel like we're living in some kind of alternate universe, or a comic book setting like DC's Bizarro World oft-referenced in Seinfeld. Nostradamus couldn't have predicted this on his best day.
 As if this all wasn't strange enough, one of the few remaining bastions of consistency -- a standby classic providing a sense of normalcy, and when needed, the bitter truth -- continues in unexpected and uncertain directions. I refer to that glorious beer style, lauded for its piney, dank character, and defined by its bitter hop bite (or IBU count) -- the India Pale Ale.
 Remember IBUs (International Bitterness Units), the once glorified scale approximating bitterness in beer for around 100 years, and so intertwined with the IPA that brewers at one time were determined to create as bitter and IBU- laden a version as the human tongue could taste?
 Things sure do change. Most of today's IPAs are almost unrecognizable from the bitter original -- many sweet fermentations are closer to orange juice or soda than what one would expect of beer. This curious shift in style actually created a sub-style called the New England IPA, which takes the classic West Coast IPA, initially inspired by the original bitter British IPA, and flips it on its head, approaching IBUs like a dirty word. Within both IPA categories there are even sub-styles, further muddying the water.
 The juicier, sweeter IPA's have brought many more people into the IPA fold, but unfortunately, it has homogenized the beer market, and one could argue, bastardized the style by reframing bitterness as unwanted. Experimentation and innovation are exciting for the brewer and beer aficionado, but it is important to remember that the genius of most great beers is the balance it can achieve between malt sweetness and hop bitterness -- kind of the whole point to using those two ingredients together (in most cases).
 If you're like me and pining for an IPA that pays respect to historical roots or simply miss IBUs in your beer you are in luck. From the company that first introduced a year-round Double IPA comes Stone Brewing's Ruined Again, a Triple IPA brewed with the same ingredients as their infamous Ruination, but even more malt and hops.
 Ruined Again will take your palate close to the pinnacle of IPA-dom with a gigantic 10.8% ABV and an unabashed 100+ IBUs. Thankfully, Stone has not forgotten their calling.
 This week's recommendation: Stone Brewing Ruined Again Triple IPA, a big, bitter, boozy IPA brewed with Magnum, Centennial, and Citra hops for bitter, tropical, dank tasting notes. 10.8% ABV. Escondido, California.

In its lone concession to consistency, the NFL allowed teams to pipe in 80 decibels of manufactured crowd noise through speakers inside stadiums. Whether created by a relatively small number of human voices or by artificial means, the sound is unlikely to cause opposing offenses to alter their gameplan.


  It will be odd not hearing the roar of the home crowd when the visitors face a critical third-down conversion, and teams that keep track of false start penalties created by full-throated fans could have nothing to add to the tote board this fall.


  But what effect will that have on games? Could road teams’ winning percentage rise?


  Including the playoffs, away teams won 47.3% of the time in 2019.


  Some trends are easily explained. The top four seeds in the NFL playoffs — Baltimore, San Francisco, Kansas City and New Orleans — were a combined 27-4 away from home (the Chiefs had one road game moved to Mexico City). Likewise, the Bengals finished 0-7 on the road, and the Detroit Lions — who picked third in the draft — were 1-6-1.


  Other teams paid a costly penalty for their lack of success away from home. Losing road records helped keep the Dallas Cowboys (3-5), Indianapolis Colts (2-6), Raiders (2-6) and Denver Broncos (2-6) out of the postseason despite the fact all four played winning football at home.


  There are several factors that play into home-field advantage. Loud crowds like those in Kansas City, Seattle and New Orleans are often cited for their impact on the game. But fans aren’t the only part of the equation.


  West coast teams notoriously do not fare well with 1 p.m. kickoffs in the Eastern time zone, when players’ body clocks are set to 10 a.m., for example.


  Conversely, some coaches believe there’s an advantage to being on the road. Players often are isolated in hotels — even more true in 2020 — and the focus can be 100% on football.


  With crowds mostly muted at least at the start of the season, this fall could serve as a quality control group for future studies.


  How much credit do fans deserve for home-field advantage? Over the next four months, we just might find out.

The biggest professional fight of Alex “Eazy” Polizzi’s career comes Friday night in front of an empty arena.


  Welcome to the sports world in 2020.


  Polizzi, a Beloit Memorial graduate, will take on Rafael Carvalho (16-4) at the Mohegan Sun Arena in Uncasville, Conn.


  The 6-foot, 205-pound Polizzi has yet to lose in six fights since turning pro in July of 2018.


  This will be his first bout since February, thanks to the COVID-19 pandemic.


  “I’m excited to get out there,” Polizzi said in a telephone interview Thursday. “We were really on a roll back in February before the pandemic hit. I had signed a deal with (MMA promoter) Bellator and was ready to go, and then things slowed down quite a bit sports-wise. It’s great to be back.”


  Polizzi said the pandemic has had its challenges for a fighter who also works moving pianos.


  “Like everyone, this has been tough to deal with,” Polizzi said. “I’m lucky enough that I was only laid off work for a couple of weeks here in Madison. I was actually able to take a little time when I was laid off and built a squat bench with some 4x4’s, so that was fun. I was able to get my workouts in after a while and generally able to stay sane in these troubling time.”


  While there is plenty of video available on his next opponent, Polizzi said he hasn’t watched much.


  “I really just focus in on me and what I’m doing,” Polizzi said. “He can watch me all day if he wants. Watching other guys has never been that helpful for me. I have a core group of coaches that will watch that stuff and let me know what the best game plan in going to be.”


  The Northwestern University graduate went back and focused on the fundamentals during his time off.


  “It’s always for me a system of going back and watching my old film,” Polizzi said. “I figure out where I goofed up here and there. The one thing that I’ve really worked on is getting lighter on my feet. As a former wrestler, I tend to be heavy-footed and plod forward like an immovable force. In MMA, that’s not always the best strategy. I need to have a little more movement and angles and a little less straight ahead.”


  Signing a contract with Bellator was a huge step in Polizzi’s goal to put down the pianos and eventually become a full-time fighter.


  “Whenever people have asked me about it, I tell them that I’m in this to have fun,” Polizzi said. “This is a blast for me. Right now I’m on the undercard, and the next step is to get on the main card. That’s what’s going to lead me to more opportunities to have better fights, more challenging opponents and a chance to go full-time. It’s definitely something I can see myself doing.”


  The good news for local fans about being on the undercard is that the fight will stream for free on Bellator’s YouTube page, beginning at 7 p.m. Beloit’s The Rock Bar & Grill will have the fight on its big screen.


  Bellator has been taking all of the necessary precautions in light of the pandemic’s continued hold on the country.


  “There won’t be any fans in the arena at all,” Polizzi said. “There are just the fighters, the referee, the judges and the corner men. So it’s going to be real quiet in there. I flew into Connecticut last week and immediately had to quarantine and get tested. They are taking our temperature daily, and everyone has their own area in the locker room. They are taking it really seriously with the safety measures.”


  As his star continues to rise, Polizzi reflects on the start of his career as an amateur.


  “When I started all this, it was just to get a solid workout in and have some fun,” Polizzi said. “When I stopped wrestling after college, I wanted something to keep me in shape. I had it in the back of my head to do this some day as a pro, but a full-time career, I didn’t see that coming. But a couple fights down the road, who knows? Maybe I’ll be able to pay rent just by punching people. That would be nice.”

Tiger football is gearing up to begin their “summer” strength and conditioning program on September 28. Normally this begins in June, but this year, you have to just buckle up and take off on the training when and as soon as you can, fitting the timing of it to match up when your competitive season is. The football season for the. 2020-21 school year is set to begin late in February.


  The New Mexico Activities Association (NMAA) is working to have a competitive power lifting event take place in October. It will be done virtually, with athletes working in their own separate school’s facilities. It’s seen as a way to get our high school athletes involved and build excitement and positive attitudes about being in shape for athletics of all sports. We should have more details about that next week.


  •The NMAA is meeting Friday, September 11 to discuss the way forward for student music programs, specifically, band and choir. Both these are NMAA sanctioned student activities and ones that we have here. The Tiger band and the choir have been on the resurgence. Both these groups have student musicians and song stylists who are anxious to get back to work.


  •We’re hearing rumblings of another new Team of Tigers getting ready to leap onto the scene here in Tiger Town. There’s some pretty serious talk about getting a Tiger’s tennis team, something that has already been given NMAA approval. This is an exciting development, one sure to attract some student- athletes to pick up rackets and get out on the courts. Watch this space for details on this.


  For all Tiger athletes, if you have not already done so, get in touch with your coach. The work is beginning. Make sure that YOU are doing your part in building Tiger Pride and to Restore the Roar!

President Trump has betrayed the American people and the world for almost four years. The Republican Senate has known it all along and are at least as complicit in their criminal silence.


   


  My father was a career Marine, retiring as a lieutenant colonel. He fought in WW II and Korea. He was awarded two Bronze stars. He was not a loser or a sucker. He was a courageous believer in the democracy that President Trump and his silent minority has brought to the edge of disintegration.


   


  Even though Trump knew, since January, that COVID-19 was "deadly" and very dangerous, he failed to take actions to help in its eradication. Instead, he lied, sometimes daily, and now has the blood of over 200,000 (according to the New York Times) Americans on his hands.


   


  He is an autocrat with only his own power and money to care about. He has told the world about some new nuclear weapons recently developed so starting a new nuclear arms race. And what does Putin and Russia have on him that he can't acknowledge the bounties Russia, through the Taliban, put on U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan? Someone needs to remove the nuclear codes from this madman.


   


  And President Trump, resign now.

WICHITA -- Universities don't just sell the chance at an education. The whole college experience has been a key tool for keeping students around.


   


  Wichita State University budgeted more than $1 million dollars on ways for students to have fun on campus last year.


   


  But face masks and social distancing make it harder to pull off those in- person events built on the idea of bringing lots of students together. Even with those precautions, any gathering risks spreading the coronavirus. That's caused universities in Kansas to cut back on their computer-free, real-life physical activities.


   


  Yet colleges haven't canceled all of campus life. Kansas State University has film screenings. Wichita State's held relay races.


   


  Here are four reasons why universities still plan on holding in-person events.


   


  Keep students enrolled


   


  Across the country, fewer kids are going to college. Schools in Kansas have tried different tricks to get more students to enroll, such as offering in- state tuition to out-of-state recruits.


   


  But there's another way to get more students to graduate -- stop the ones already on campus from leaving.


   


  "To be able to keep a student is far less expensive than being able to recruit a new student," said Thomas Lane, K-State's dean of students.


   


  For years, universities have banked on in-person events to get students to stick around. The theory goes that silly games and food festivals make students feel connected to their school and less likely to leave.


   


  Universities argue that if an in-person event keeps students from dropping out and wasting a semester of tuition dollars, then those events should keep happening -- even in a pandemic.


   


  "I don't think any student starts off their higher education journey thinking that they don't want to be on that journey at some time next year," Lane said.


   


  Virtual events don't cut it


   


  Universities have shifted many of their events online. But a videoconference session isn't much of a party. It can't replicate meeting face-to-face.


   


  "Zoom is not a replacement for those social events," said Rob Danzman, a mental health counselor in Indiana. "We miss a lot when we're not in person."


   


  There's also the "Zoom fatigue." With students taking a large portion of their classes online, getting them to hop onto yet another video event is a tough sell.


   


  Kansas schools have been trying to offer a mix of both, to satisfy the students itching for that in-person interaction and those uncomfortable with gathering in the flesh. Wichita State let students watch the Clash of the Colleges -- a collection of absurd competitions -- at home or join in with virtual games.


   


  Mental health


   


  Colleges have been dealing with mental health issues on campus for more than a decade. Stress. Anxiety. Loneliness. Last year, one doctor called it an epidemic.


   


  Health experts worry those problems will worsen this fall.


   


  "Social isolation kills people very easily," Danzman said.


   


  Some students were already feeling socially isolated before the pandemic. Now they say making new friends is a lot more difficult when you only see your classmates on a screen.


   


  "I definitely am missing out on actually sitting next to people in my classes and making small talk," said Ashley Thompson, a freshman at Wichita State. "It's hard to make those connections."


   


  Students also said it's difficult making friends even on campus with desks kept 6 feet apart.


   


  Universities worry that removing all in-person events will further cut off students from each other and only deepen the mental health crisis.


   


  Safer than a kegger


   


  Since opening up, universities have seen a rapid increase in coronavirus cases. Universities have been pointing at fraternities and sororities for holding big parties that spread the coronavirus. As of Friday, colleges and universities had 27 outbreaks, many linked to Greek organizations.


   


  Most students plan on skipping the parties this year, according to a national survey conducted before school began. But a viral video showed a large, mask- free gathering at one KU fraternity.


   


  Schools say if they don't offer students a safe alternative, they'll continue to find riskier ways to meet up.


   


  Universities are taking precautions with their events -- limiting sizes, requiring face masks and keeping most events outside. Still, even with these steps, schools can't guarantee these events won't further spread the virus.


   


  "Anytime you get anybody together right now that is a wildcard," said Rachel Kohman, the senior director of Emporia State's Center for Student Involvement. "But if we aren't offering some safe, in-person opportunities for our students, then the likelihood that things we have zero control over … are going to inherently increase."

“Operating a business would require the owner to hire people to manage tee times, collect greens fees, maintain the tee boxes, greens and fairways, to act as the course ranger, to maintain the books and records of the business, generally manage the golf business and do all the other things necessary to operate a business. To say that the trial court is merely requiring the owner to maintain the property is completely disingenuous.


  “It is requiring the property owner to do something it does not want to do and this is involuntary servitude,” Maynard wrote.


  Meanwhile, Superior Court Judge Theodore Campagnolo set Oct. 22 for a hearing on what penalties he should impose on Gee’s company, ALCR, in light of the judge’s ruling that it showed contempt of court by doing nothing to restore the 101-acre site, which was closed in 2013.


  Lakes homeowners Eileen Breslin and Linda Swain filed suit in 2014 to force the restoration of the 18-hole executive course, triggering a six-year battle in which Superior Court Judge John Hannah on three occasions has ruled the course must be restored. Both the state appellate and Supreme Courts have upheld that ruling.


  In a brief hearing last week, both Maynard and the plaintiffs’ lawyer, Tim Barnes, said they would need time to present some evidence and arguments about sanctions for Campagnolo’s contempt finding.


  Barnes last month suggested to Campagnolo that he wants the company to pay $10,000 or $15,000 for each of the 202 homes abutting the course. That would total $2.02 million or $3.03 million.


  But he clarified his request last week, telling the judge that “whatever monetary sanction we request is really only to compel or coerce compliance” with the restoration order and that if Gee complies, “the sanctions would not be required.”


  He also said he intends to present one or two Ahwatukee residents, not his clients, who will testify about the impact of the course’s deteriorated condition over the last six years. That testimony would be aimed at supporting the kind of sanctions he is seeking, Barnes said.


  There was no mention of Maynard’s bid to the nation’s highest court, which at least for now won’t stop the ongoing contempt proceeding.

When Chinese foreign minister Huang Hua met Prime Minister Indira Gandhi on June 29, 1981, the two agreed that unless the boundary question is settled, it would be difficult to maintain friendship and goodwill between the two neighbours.


  More than 39 years later, the People's Liberation Army and the Chinese foreign ministry appear to be on different pages. The PLA is hard at work in its single-minded effort to reach to the Green Line defined by a 1959 map by then Chinese Premier Chou En-Lai while the foreign ministry is talking about building bilateral economic ties, which over the years, did strongly tilt towards Beijing.


  Much as State Councillor and foreign minister Wang Yi tried to gloss over a near war-like situation in Ladakh during his two-hour-long meeting with his Indian counterpart S Jaishankar, the fact is that the 1981 parallel track policy of working to build on harmonious ties even as the two countries sort out the boundary issue has not paid any dividends to India.


  Instead, India has lost territory since then, letting 65 patrolling points defined by the China Study Group in 1976 turn into the de facto Line of Control (LAC) in Ladakh. The patrolling points are well within the Indian perception of the LAC but the movement of the Indian forces to these points has been curtailed by the presence of Chinese troops, face-offs with PLA patrolling parties and on occasions, the harsh weather and mountainous terrain.


   


   


  As Wang and Jaishanar arrived at a five-point consensus in Moscow to first disengage, and then de-escalate in Ladakh, the Communist Party of China mouthpiece Global Times continued to play up its war-mongering editorial.


  "If India wants peace, China and India should uphold the LAC of November 7, 1959. If India wants war, China will oblige," the tabloid, considered an extended arm of the Chinese government, says. It claims that India does not want to implement the 1959 LAC as it is holding a grudge for its failure in 1962 war.


  It is this 1962 mindset that pervades the regime of Xi Jinping. President Xi, who evidently sees himself as a true successor to Mao Zedong, decided to target India in 1962 by creating an impression that India was out to occupy Tibet.


  The aggressive line projected by the party's mouthpiece is totally at odds with what State Councillor Wang Yi's stand at his meeting with Jaishankar where the Chinese side did not appear to acknowledge the role that the PLA had played to spike tensions. As one diplomat put it, it was as if the build-up and the friction in Ladakh was an act of God.


  Given the Chinese expansionist plans to make unilateral cartographic changes in Ladakh, the disengagement process will not be easy as the PLA wants to reach the 1959 Green Line and push Indian Army troops beyond the self- designated line. This is completely in violation of the 1993 Peace and Tranquillity Accord, which talks about mutual and equal security on the border for both sides.


  Under the circumstances, India will have to wait for PLA Commander-in-Chief and President Xi Jinping to give instructions to his western theatre command troops to go back to barracks if Beijing is seriously interested in rolling back the aggression. While the Chinese political mindset has not changed since 1962, the Indian mindset changed in 2014. Beijing must take this into account before making the next move.

GWS have made a staggering eight changes for their most important game of the AFL season, asking Toby Greene to lead the team against Melbourne after sensationally dropping captain Stephen Coniglio.
 Coniglio was appointed skipper in the aftermath of the Giants' loss in the 2019 grand final.
 The midfielder's leadership and patchy form have been talking points throughout an underwhelming 2020 for GWS, who cling to eighth spot on the ladder.
 The Giants, whose run of four consecutive finals appearances is at major risk of ending, have now dumped their captain for a clash with 10th-placed Melbourne that coach Leon Cameron has dubbed "our first final".
 Sam Jacobs, Jye Caldwell, Jackson Hately and Lachie Ash have also been axed after a shock loss to last-placed Adelaide, while Aidan Corr (ankle), Bobby Hill (managed) and Jake Riccardi (managed) were enforced omissions.
 Fit-again stars Zac Williams and Josh Kelly headline the inclusions.
 Jack Buckley, the son of North Melbourne chairman Ben, will debut.
 The Demons have called up Neville Jetta, Charlie Spargo and Mitch Brown in place of injured defender Michael Hibberd plus Braydon Preuss and Toby Bedford.
 Matt de Boer, the other leading candidate to captain GWS, described Greene as a fantastic leader and backed the fiery forward to "really spark the group"
 "Toby's passion and will to win is really infectious," de Boer said on the eve of his 200th game.
 "His footy IQ is through the roof.
 "It was a little bit of a shock (to learn Coniglio was dropped) ... everyone's certainly on notice.
 "We know we haven't been playing our best football, but write us off at your peril."
 De Boer revealed Coniglio's classy words after his dumping.
 "The first thing he said to me was 'how great is it that it's your 200th'. That's an insight into the champion Stephen is and will continue to be," the former Fremantle utility said.
 "We're probably not helping him enough."
 GWS assistant coaches Lenny Hayes and Brad Miller told players on Friday morning they were leaving the club at the end of this season because of family reasons.
 Cameron confirmed Coniglio's demotion in the same meeting, explaining it was simply a matter of picking the best possible team.
 "Stephen is the first to admit that his form hasn't been where he, and the club, want it to be," Cameron said.
 "We absolutely back him in to get back to his best sooner rather than later."
 Demons coach Simon Goodwin, whose side have also been horribly inconsistent this season, hoped for a "big response" after losses to Sydney and Fremantle.
 "A disappointing five days in Cairns," Goodwin said.
 "We aspired to play finals at the start of the year but we can't look at that, we've got to look at what we can do this week."

The superseding indictment also includes new allegations about Huawei and its subsidiaries’ involvement in business and technology projects in countries subject to U.S., E.U. and/or U.N. sanctions, such as Iran and North Korea – as well as the company’s efforts to conceal the full scope of that involvement. The defendants’ activities, which included arranging for shipment of Huawei goods and services to end users in sanctioned countries, were typically conducted through local affiliates in the sanctioned countries. Reflecting the inherent sensitivity of conducting business in jurisdictions subject to sanctions, internal Huawei documents allegedly referred to such jurisdictions with code names. For example, the code “A2” referred to Iran, and “A9” referred to North Korea.

But the vaccine had its skeptics, too. Nasal swabs showed the monkeys from the first test still had the virus in their nose, meaning they might still be able to spread the virus to others, and their neutralizing antibody count was quite low. In a _Forbes_ article, former Harvard Medical School professor and prominent cancer and HIV researcher William Haseltine argued the Jenner Institute researchers didn’t have the data to support their claim that their vaccine protected the monkeys. “Time will tell if [proceeding to human trials] is the best approach,” he wrote. “I wouldn’t bet on it.” The Phase I/II trial, meanwhile, reported levels of neutralizing antibodies comparable to those seen in recovered Covid-19 patients, but lower than those generated by other vaccine candidates. And the scientists administering the trial tested only 35 participants for antibodies out of 543 who had received the vaccine.

While a resident at our Veterans’ Home, I became friends with a Navy vet carrying a very heavy burden. While serving offshore in Vietnam he and another sailor had experienced a terrible, traumatic event. The survivor’s guilt he felt had bent his shoulders and slowed his walk in a fog of depression.


  But one day a surviving shipmate paid him a surprise visit. For the first time, I saw my friend smile. I saw his shoulders gain strength. The two men talked for hours, renewing the closeness, the bond they’d formed serving together in Vietnam. I watched how regaining contact with someone with a shared experience could transform a life. My friend was on his way to a new way of living with optimism and hope.

Paris St Germain lost 1-0 at promoted RC Lens in their first Ligue 1 game of the season on Thursday following a bad mistake by goalkeeper Marcin Bulka, as the French champions suffered in the absence of several players who tested positive for COVID-19.


  Pole Bulka, 20, tried to play the ball out along the floor to a team mate but Cameroonian forward Ignatius Gango got there first to fire into the top corner and give Lens a surprise lead in the 57th minute.


  Bulka, playing only his second Ligue 1 match for PSG, was one of several inexperienced players given a chance due to the number of positive tests for the virus, which included first-choice keeper Keylor Navas, world record signing Neymar and France striker Kylian Mbappe.


  They could only field four players who started their 1-0 defeat by Bayern Munich in the Champions League final on Aug. 23 and struggled to get going against a motivated Lens, who were playing their first home game back in the top flight after five years in Ligue 2.


   


   


  Lens were able to enjoy the moment with 5,000 fans who were allowed into their stadium as part of an easing of coronavirus restrictions at sporting events in France.


  PSG started the season later than the other teams in Ligue 1 due to reaching the Champions League final, with their first game against Metz rescheduled and the match with Lens, originally set for Aug. 29, also pushed back.


  Midfielder Marco Veratti put the defeat down to a lack of preparation time due to the Champions League final as well as the coronavirus absentees.


  "I think there were a lot of factors in the defeat but we gave everything we could," he told French television network Canal Plus.


  "It was impossible to ask for better after only one week of training. Our players were very tired after the match. This sort of scheduling is very strange.


  "A lot of our players were out with coronavirus and we had a lot of youngsters. It will be more of the same madness in three days (against Olympique de Marseille).

Parks & Wildlife manages some 350 wildlife areas and nearly 240 trust lands purchased using angling and hunting license fees to conserve wildlife habitat and provide wildlife-related recreation.


  The CPW website states that it’s finding “a significant trend of people engaging in activities for which these properties were not intended,” from illegal camping to actions that disturb and displace wildlife.


  Many if not most state wildlife areas and trust lands are some distance from towns and cities. In Salida, however, both Frantz and Sands are close by, just northwest of the city. Sands is directly adjacent to city limits and Frantz is within easy walking distance of residential neighborhoods.


  Given their proximity to town, their locations on the Arkansas and their trails, both Frantz and Sands are popular with hikers and bikers, as well as with anglers. Both are favored by families with kids for outdoor outings and picnics, as well as fishing.


  Colorado’s population growth and recreation boom is placing much greater pressure and stress on the state’s natural resources, from climbing 14,000-foot peaks, recreating in wilderness areas and on Forest Service lands to visits to national and state parks.


  In addition, with the coronavirus more residents and visitors are choosing to recreate outdoors, creating additional pressure on public lands.


  Maintaining these resources and conserving them for their intended use does not come cheap. The costs are of particular concern for state agencies that depend exclusively on licenses and fees for their operations.


  In managing some 600 wildlife areas and trust lands, it appears unlikely that CPW is going to make any licensing exception for Frantz and Sands users. Doing so would open up requests from dozens of other communities looking for similar exceptions.


  This is not to say the city should just give up on possibilities posed in the mayor’s letter. Formation of the 150-mile Arkansas Headwaters Recreation Area is an example. The AHRA started with river users, property owners and local, state and national officials getting together to resolve conflicts around growing use of a state and national resource.


  Thus, sharing maintenance costs between local governments and state agencies or some type of lease agreement between the entities is not out of the question. Forming a task force of local officials and interested citizens to pursue options would be a logical next step.


  Any change in the status of Frantz and Sands will at a minimum require action by the wildlife commission, if not state legislators and the governor. And any change is going to take some time.


  In the interim, those using Frantz and Sands for walking and biking, bird watching, to get back to nature, or simply enjoy a walk outside of town, should abide by CPW’s rules relating to the areas and purchase a license.


  For adults, a small game license and habitat stamp is $40.24; $45.30 for a fishing license and stamp; or $9.85 total for seniors. These are relatively small costs for access to Frantz and Sands and will help maintain the areas for their intended purpose along with other recreational pursuits.

After a few days of feeling less like Novak Djokovic and more like No-chance Djokovic, I decided it was time to turn the tables and introduce my boyfriend to a sport I had a little more experience in – water skiing! Niche, I know, but sometimes it’s the only way to find a sport your partner hasn’t already excelled in when they’re a sportsman. We had an incredible time, and couldn’t get enough of the ocean and the feeling of gliding across the waves.

Headsets are an essential part of the online multiplayer gaming experience these days. They allow you to communicate with teammates -- or opponents -- depending on the game. Hell, even for offline single player games, a quality headset can usually provide superior audio compared to many chintzy computer speakers. They can also be used for music and movies, of course.
