Now coming to the matter of boycotting PUBG. I am completely in for nationalism and patriotism, but how does that make a difference? According to a recent report by Statista, PUBG was one of the most popular games on Steam and had a peak of over 5,53,000 concurrent players in May 2020. The highest number of concurrent players was recorded in January 2018 at 3.24 million. A separate report suggests that PUBG Mobile is closing in on half a billion downloads, with a total of over 400 million players out of which 50 million are daily active users. Clearly the game is quite popular, and considering the huge fan base, it doesn’t seem like users in India would completely give it up. I wouldn’t.

While the boycott China discourse has really strengthened in recent times, underlined by patriotic sentiments and Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s call for vocal for local and ‘aatmanirbhar’ initiatives, it remains to be seen how lasting an impact does this have on Chinese companies that have almost become household names in India.

In the recent past, Jong Un has been seen taking a leading role in a new, more hard-line pressure campaign against South Korea, highlighting what analysts say is a substantive policy role that goes beyond being her brother's assistant.

Yes a majority of these are based out of China, but the game was originally created by Brendan Greene, an Irish video game designer. The game was eventually developed for PCs and consoles after being acquired by Bluehole, a gaming studio based out of South Korea. Tencent Holdings, which is Chinese multinational conglomerate, announced in 2017 that it has invested a large sum of money into Bluehole. Eventually acquiring 1.5% of Bluehole and announcing its plans to fully acquire the gaming studios. As of today, Tencent is one of the biggest shareholders in Bluehole, thus being associated as the ‘creator’ of PUBG.
