"Our US dealerships finished the third quarter with a healthy level of inventory," CEO Mary Barra told investors in late October soon after the strike ended. "As the strike continued ... with no additional vehicles in the pipeline for many weeks, our dealer inventories will be temporarily leaner than we'd like. The team is doing everything in its power to restore our supply of vehicles back to normal levels." But there were limits to how much overtime could be scheduled at the plants to rebuild supplies.
 Much of the drop in shipments to dealers in the quarter came from lower shipments of the new full-size pickups, GM's key product. But sales to customers held up well in the quarter, with the Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra posting a 20% increase in sales in the quarter compared to a year ago.

 BOSTON - Gov. Charlie Baker is helping Foxborough and the Kraft Group to advance a Gillette Stadium event licensing bill.
 Town officials and the Kraft Group have been working for three to four years on a plan to develop an annual event license to cover all of the major events that occur at the stadium, which hosts concerts and the home football and soccer games of the New England Patriots and New England Revolution, respectively.
 As outlined by town officials, the application would be submitted each January or February and list all events expected to occur at Gillette over the next 12 months. If an unlisted event came up during the year, the Board of Selectmen could hold a special hearing on the event or accept it without a hearing and fold it into the existing license, Board of Selectman Chairman Mark Elfman said.
 Baker filed legislation (H 4282) on Dec. 30 to facilitate the town's plan by amending state licensing laws to allow Foxborough's annual event license to expire one year from the date that it is issued.
 \"This makes a minor change to current law, which provides that all licenses issued shall expire on December 31 of each year,\" Baker wrote to lawmakers.
 The licensing proposal surfaced at a Foxborough Board of Selectmen meeting in October attended by Peter Tamm, an attorney for the Kraft Group. At that meeting, according to minutes, town counsel Patrick Costello said the change would reduce the number of administrative hearings held each year - licenses are currently issued on an event-by-event basis.
 The change would not limit the board's right to protect the public safety and welfare, and the approach has been adopted in Mansfield, home to the Xfinity Center, and Boston, which is home to TD Garden and Fenway Park, according to the minutes. Selectmen unanimously approved the proposed licensing arrangement.
 Baker said the legislation, if adopted, would lead to a more flexible licensing system in Foxborough.
 The House on Thursday referred the bill to the Consumer Protection and Professional Licensure Committee, which is co-chaired by Sen. Paul Feeney (D-Foxborough).

Kewanee police officers are being trained to be quick on the draw.


  But they may ask you to roll up your sleeve first.


  KPD will become the first area law enforcement agency to train its officers to draw blood for evidence, a move prompted by the state's legalization of marijuana and concerns over the limitations of police to accurately test THC impairment levels.


  "I don't know of any other department in Henry County that is doing this," said Kewanee Police Chief Troy Ainley. "We are getting out ahead of this."


  The KPD, like other Illinois law enforcement agencies, seem to be bracing for any unforeseen problems the new law could bring. When Ainley heard from a local mobile training team about the phlebotomist pilot program that was up and running, he immediately got the department on board.


  "We need to be as prepared as we can be," Ainley said.


  As of Jan. 6, two Kewanee police officers will be enrolled in the online portion of the phlebotomy training course. The online portion of the classes goes through this month.


  In February labs begin, which will require Kewanee officers Dalton Kuffel and Roy Carpenter to begin practicing actual blood draws. The officers will finish up their training at Richland Community College in Decatur, where they will be given some additional training and tips. Ainley said it's a chance for his officers to learn an additional skill.


  The move to train officers as phlebotomists will serve a two-fold purpose, the chief said.


  "This will allow us to have officers in-house to draw blood and eliminate evidence problems," he said. "If we have a blood draw now, that's a trip to the hospital. He noted that the hospital is often busy and unable to process evidence immediately.


  Ainley said officers will be on the lookout for signs of impaired driving, for both alcohol and marijuana, which include crossing the center line and committing traffic violations, both indicators of potential impairment.


  Ainley said anyone suspected of driving impaired can be taken to the police department and tested. The Illinois field sobriety blood test for marijuana considers drivers testing at 5 nanograms or higher per milliliter of blood to be driving impaired.


  Ainley said he believes the additional training will streamline the process. "We are doing more with less personnel," he said. "This just gives our officers an extra skill and tool they need."

When Kea Turner's 74-year-old grandmother checked into Virginia's Sentara Virginia Beach General Hospital with advanced lung cancer, she landed in the oncology unit where every patient was monitored by a bed alarm.      "Even if she would slightly roll over, it would go off," Turner said. Small movements - such as reaching for a tissue - would set off the alarm, as well. The beeping would go on for up to 10 minutes, Turner said, until a nurse arrived to shut it off.      Tens of thousands of alarms shriek, beep and buzz every day in every U.S. hospital. All sound urgent, but few require immediate attention or get it.      Intended to keep patients safe alerting nurses to potential problems, they also create a riot of disturbances for patients trying to heal and get some rest.      Nearly every machine in a hospital is now outfitted with an alarm - infusion pumps, ventilators, bedside monitors tracking blood pressure, heart activity and a drop in oxygen in the blood. Even beds are alarmed to detect movement that might portend a fall. The glut of noise means that the medical staff is less likely to respond.      Alarms have ranked as one of the top 10 health technological hazards every year since 2007, according to the research firm ECRI Institute. That could mean staffs were too swamped with alarms to notice a patient in distress or that the alarms were misconfigured. The Joint Commission, which accredits hospitals, warned the nation about the "frequent and persistent" problem of alarm safety in 2013. It now requires hospitals to create formal processes to tackle alarm system safety, but there is no national data on whether progress has been made in reducing the prevalence of false and unnecessary alarms.      The commission has estimated that of the thousands of alarms going off throughout a hospital every day, an estimated 85% to 99% do not require clinical intervention. Staff, facing widespread "alarm fatigue," can miss critical alerts, leading to patient deaths. Patients may get anxious about fluctuations in heart rate or blood pressure that are perfectly normal, the commission said.      And bed alarms, a recent arrival, can lead to immobility and dangerous loss of muscle mass when patients are terrified that any movement will set off the bleeps.      An 'epidemic of immobility'   In the past 30 years, the number of medical devices that generate alarms has risen from about 10 to nearly 40, said Priyanka Shah, a senior project engineer at ECRI Institute. A breathing ventilator alone can emit 30 to 40 different noises, she said.      In addition to triggering bed alarms, patients who move in bed may set off false alarms from pulse oximeters, which measure the oxygen in a patient's blood, or carbon dioxide monitors, which measure the level of the gas in someone's breath, she said.      Shah said she has seen hospitals reduce unneeded alarms, but doing so is "a constant work in progress."      'Cry wolf phenomenon'   Maria Cvach, an alarm expert and director of policy management and integration for Johns Hopkins Health System, found that on one step-down unit (a level below intensive care) in the hospital in 2006, an average of 350 alarms went off per patient per day, from the cardiac monitor alone.      She said no international standard exists for what these alarms sound like, so they vary by manufacturer and device. "It's really impossible for the staff to identify by sound everything that they hear," she said.      The flood of alarms creates a "cry wolf phenomenon," Cvach said. The alarms are "constantly calling for help. The staff look at them. They say that's just a false alarm - they may ignore the real alarm."      Bed alarms, for example, are meant to summon nurses so they can supervise patients to walk safely. But research has shown that the use of alarms doesn't prevent falls. Nursing staffs are often stretched thin and don't reach the bedside before a patient hits the ground.      Meanwhile, patients may feel immobilized at a time when even a few hundred steps per day could significantly improve their recovery. Immobility in the hospital can create other problems for patients, leaving them with often irreversible functional decline, research has shown.      Bed alarms have proliferated since 2008, when the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services declared hospital falls should "never" happen and stopped paying for injuries related to those falls. After that policy change, the odds of nurses using a bed alarm increased 2.3 times, according to a study led by Dr. Ronald Shorr, director of the Geriatric Research, Education and Clinical Center at the Malcom Randall Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Gainesville, Florida. The alarms have become a standard feature in new hospital beds.      But Shorr noted that, in contrast, bed alarms are being removed from other settings: In 2017, CMS began discouraging their widespread use in nursing homes, arguing that audible bed or chair alarms may be considered a "restraint" if the resident "is afraid to move to avoid setting off the alarm."

PORTLAND, Maine (AP) — Two members of Maine's congressional delegation acknowledged Friday that the head of Iran's elite Quds Force was responsible for evil acts, but both said they worry about consequences of the general's killing on U.S. policy in the Middle East. Iran vowed “harsh retaliation” for a U.S. airstrike near Baghdad's airport that killed Gen. Qassem Soleimani, the head of Iran's elite Quds Force. President Donald Trump said Friday that he ordered the killing, saying Soleimani was “plotting to kill” many Americans. Trump also said Soleimani was responsible for killing and wounding “thousands” of Americans and many more in the region. “Soleimani was an evil man whose death we do not mourn. Still, this move deliberately escalates conflict with Iran, increases the risk to American lives, and moves us closer to a senseless war without the consent of Congress,\" U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree, a Democrat, said in a written statement. Sen. Angus King, a political independent and a member of the Senate armed services and intelligence committees, said in a statement that “calm deliberation” of options and consequences is necessary to avoid a major new conflict in the Middle East. “In the short term, I am concerned this could bring about violent reprisals from Iran and their partners that will place Americans working or serving in the region in increased danger; in the long term, the rapidly rising escalation between our two nations could lead to dangerous and bloody consequences,\" King said. The United States urged its citizens to leave Iraq “immediately” as fears mounted that the strike and any retaliation by Iran could ignite a conflict that engulfs the region.

By John Whitesides and Simon Lewis
 WASHINGTON, Jan 3 (Reuters) - Democratic presidential contenders on Friday condemned the air strike that killed prominent Iranian military commander Qassem Soleimani, saying President Donald Trump's decision was reckless and could lead the United States to another war in the Middle East.
 The candidates, vying for the right to challenge Trump in the November 2020 election, questioned whether the president had a broader strategy in dealing with Iran, and used the action to highlight their approach to dealing with foreign adversaries.
 "President Trump just tossed a stick of dynamite into a tinderbox," former U.S. Vice President Joe Biden said in a statement.
 At a campaign event in Dubuque, Iowa, he added that no American would mourn Soleimani's death but "the prospect of direct conflict with Iran is greater than it has ever been."
 Liberal U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, who has consistently opposed U.S. military intervention overseas, said the move "brings us closer to another disastrous war in the Middle East that could cost countless lives and trillions more dollars."
 The overnight attack against the general, regarded as the second most powerful figure in Iran, was a dramatic escalation of hostilities in the Middle East between Iran and the United States and its allies, principally Israel and Saudi Arabia.
 U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the strike aimed to disrupt an "imminent attack" that would have endangered Americans in the Middle East. But it was a risky gamble for Trump, who has criticized longstanding U.S. entanglements in the region and promised to end "endless wars."
 Republicans said the move was a sign Trump - who was impeached by the Democratic-led House of Representatives last month and faces a Senate trial on charges he abused his office and obstructed Congress - was restoring American strength and leadership.
 "At a time when the president is under impeachment by the Democrats, there's nothing wrong with him showing strength and resolve in the face of a foreign threat," said Republican strategist Ron Bonjean, who is close to the White House.
 Democrats said it was another troubling indication of Trump's erratic approach to foreign policy.
 "We're on the brink of yet another war in the Middle East," said liberal U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren. "We're not here by accident. We're here because a reckless president, his allies and his administration have spent years pushing us here."
 Many of the Democratic White House candidates, who will face voters for the first time in a month when Iowa kicks off the state-by-state nominating battle on Feb. 3, pounced on the strike to emphasize their own foreign policy philosophies and credentials.
 Biden, a former chairman of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee who emphasizes his foreign policy experience, released a 30-second online ad on Friday calling Trump "an erratic, unstable president" and portraying himself as "someone tested and trusted around the world."
 Sanders mentioned in his statement his 2002 vote against authorizing war in Iraq, which he frequently uses as a contrast to Biden, who backed the war.
 Biden, Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, and other Democrats made clear in their statements that they viewed Soleimani as a threat, but Warren, Sanders and entrepreneur Andrew Yang did not mention the Iranian commander.

Wound healing is a complex process. It mainly consists of three phases - inflammation, proliferation and tissue remodeling. Application of growth factors at the site of the wound can improve the efficiency and quality of wound healing as they stimulate development of new blood vessels and proliferation of cells, which, in turn, regulates the production and degradation of the extracellular matrix.

Perched above a beautiful setting surrounded by water, palm trees and historic buildings, Ponce Inlet, Florida, offers travelers scenic views, science and more.      Inlet visitors can climb 175 feet, up 203 stairs, to reach a beautiful view of the Atlantic Ocean and the inlet at the Ponce De Leon Inlet Light Station. The complex features the lighthouse, Ponce Inlet Museum and the buildings once used by the U.S. Coast Guard.      The museum offers self-guided tours that take a deep look into the history of the lighthouse and light station. Learn about the men and their families who were the lighthouse keepers and took charge of lighting the paths for those at sea.   The lighthouse became automated in 1953. In 1970 the Coast Guard moved from the light station, leaving the historic structures vacant. A lot of damage was done by vandals -- however, citizens took it upon themselves to get the property deeded to the town of Ponce Inlet. The property was restored to a museum and the station was listed on the National Register of Historic Places -- one of only a few light stations that had the buildings intact. It is now listed as a privately operated aid to navigation.      Guided group tours for 10 or more are available. For those wanting a different experience, sign up for the Climb to the Moon tour. The "old lighthouse keeper" will take history buffs on a trip to discover the history of the lighthouse. It takes place monthly on the eve of each full moon. Dates and times are listed at ponceinlet.org. The climb offers awesome moonlit views of the Atlantic Ocean, the world's most famous beach (Daytona), the inlet and inland waterways. Toast the full moon with a sparkling beverage as it rises over the water. Hors d'oeuvres are provided. Tickets may be purchased in advance by emailing admin@ponceinlet.org or calling 386-210-3660, ext. 10.      Or, take the two-hour Climb with the Keeper Tour. It is an intimate, informative time with the "old lighthouse keeper" to tour the museum when no other guests are present. It includes the entire lighthouse area and some that are normally closed to the general public. To jump in on this tour, email mwentzel@ponceinlet.org or call 386-210-3660, ext. 18.   Reservations are required for the special tours, and each costs $35 per person.      Tips for your visit:   • Climbers should be in good physical condition.   • Wear closed-toed shoes with non-slip soles and low heels. Flip-flops, sandals and high-heeled shoes are not recommended.   • Children must be able to climb the tower on their own.      Another climb awaits Ponce Inlet visitors at the observation tower at the Marine Science Center. The tower offers views of the estuary. Spend time with the turtles, eagles, owls and hawks, and feed the stingrays. A visit offers a great behind the scenes look into the rescue, rehabilitation and release of sick and injured turtles and birds. Visitors can observe the sea turtle patients and the operation of the hospital. It offers an opportunity to learn about the Florida marine ecosystems and animals that are indigenous to the area.      Touch a stingray and explore the nature trail; walk through the Mary Keller Bird Sanctuary, an area where the birds that no longer can live in the wild live a good life in Florida. During the Raptors Live program, visitors meet the birds of prey up close. Animal education programs are presented daily. Visit marinesciencecenter.com for times and pricing.

NEW BEDFORD -- City on a Hill Charter Public School New Bedford has quietly announced an interim principal and plans to add virtual lessons to its curriculum to help carry students through the rest of the academic year until it is set to close in June.
 In a Dec. 11 letter addressed to families and posted on its website, the charter school announced Dr. Lisa Dion as interim principal, effective that date. Dion most recently served as the vice principal of City on a Hill Circuit Street in Boston, one of three schools in the City on a Hill Charter Public School network.
 She earned a doctorate in educational leadership from Johnson and Wales University in Providence, Rhode Island and previously worked for New Bedford Public Schools, according to the letter.
 A Lisa Dion has been mentioned in several past Standard-Times stories, in 2014 and 2015 as the district literacy director and as recently as 2017 and 2018 as district manager of curriculum, data, and assessment.
 City on a Hill students and their parents had been emotional and concerned over a lack of answers after the Board of Trustees of the charter school's network voted Nov. 25 to relinquish the New Bedford campus' charter and close the school. A group of at least 15 students staged a walkout in early December, calling for teachers and their education in front of the New Bedford Public Schools administration building and City Hall.
 The last principal listed on City on a Hill's website was Amanda Kolby, although it's not clear when or how she left the school.
 The last day of instruction is expected to be June 18, unless there are additional snow days.
 "Please know that we are fully committed to finishing the year strong and to helping every family transition to a new school for the 2020-21 school year," the letter states. It expects seniors to graduate from City on a Hill in June and doesn't plan to close before the end of the school year.
 Some students have classes at its campus at 105 William St. and beginning this month, all classes will be held at 384 Acushnet Ave., its main campus. The school planned to move furniture and equipment from William Street to Acushnet Avenue over the holiday break, adding the change "will allow us to concentrate our resources to maximize educational outcomes for all students."
 In a separate letter issued Dec. 18, the school announced that starting in January, it would increase its curriculum through a blended learning model using Apex Learning, a digital curriculum provider.
 This means direct instruction from a teacher will be blended with lessons on a student's laptop provided by the school. The digital curriculum is accredited and accepted for credit by New Bedford High School, and colleges and universities around the country, the letter states.
 "We view Apex as a key component" of its commitment to students and their families, reads the letter from network Chief Executive Officer Kevin Taylor, Principal Dion and Chief Academic Officer Amber Donell.
 All Apex courses will provide the required accommodations and modifications for students with an Individualized Education Plan (IEP) and supports for English language learners.
 In an email, Jacqueline Hayes, network chief of staff and general counsel, provided the school's "staffing models" through Dec. 31 and as of Jan. 1. It appears that the school has eliminated the following positions: vice principal, a dean, a science teacher, a history teacher, two special education teachers, a special education team coordinator, speech and language therapist, four paraprofessionals, a theater arts teacher, and a coordinator of enrollment and special project and front office manager.
 That leaves the school with a principal, dean, director of school operations, two English teachers, two math teachers, a science teacher, a history teacher, a Spanish teacher, an English as a second language teacher, three special education teachers, a mental health counselor, a college and career counselor, and a nurse.
 As of Dec. 6, the school had 135 students, Hayes wrote. That's down from 141 students around the time of the closing announcement in November, according to a Standard-Times story, which also said the school ended last year with 208 students.
 It remains to be seen how many students will return from winter break on Jan. 8.
 A junior student who has preferred not to be named said by text message that she transferred out of City on a Hill because of the lack of teachers, adding "we aren't learning anything," but they watch movies, talk and use their cell phones. She now attends New Bedford High School and was able to transfer all of her credits, she said.
 Alyssa Wright said through a Facebook message that her ninth grade son has had a similar experience at City on a Hill.
 "He said he loved going there but now he said he feels it's dumb and pointless to go; there's barely any teachers to even teach and he's not learning anything anymore," she wrote, but he "refuses" to go to New Bedford High School and she feels that he won't get the help he needs there. Her son loves to learn and wants to become a teacher, she said.
 Shayna Cabral said through a Facebook message that her daughter, a junior, is in the process of transferring and will return to City on a Hill for now.

 WASHINGTON, Jan 3 (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate remained at a stalemate on Friday over how to proceed with the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump, as the chamber's leaders continued a dispute over whether top White House aides will be called as witnesses.
 After a two-week holiday recess, there was still no clarity about when Trump's impeachment trial might begin.
 Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican, said the Senate could not launch a trial without the articles of impeachment, which House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has not yet sent to the Senate.
 The Democratic-controlled House of Representatives voted in December to impeach the president for pressuring Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, a potential rival in the 2020 presidential election.
 A trial would be held in the Senate, and Trump is expected to be acquitted by the Republican-controlled chamber. But McConnell and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer have been at loggerheads since late last year over how it should be conducted.
 McConnell said on Friday the Senate should go ahead and start the trial and resolve the dispute over witnesses "mid-trial," a repetition of his earlier stance. He said this would follow the precedent set in former President Bill Clinton's impeachment trial two decades ago. Clinton, a Democrat, was acquitted by the Senate.
 "Just like 20 years ago," McConnell said, "we should address mid-trial questions such as witnesses after briefs, opening arguments, senator questions and other relevant motions."
 Schumer, speaking after McConnell, repeated his call for a commitment to call witnesses before proceedings begin. He said there had never been an impeachment trial "in which the Senate was denied the ability to hear from witnesses."
 "It may feel like we are no longer - we are no closer to establishing the rules for a Senate trial than when we last met, but the question - the vital question of whether or not we have a fair trial - ultimately rests with a majority of the senators in this chamber," Schumer said.

Fed officials worried that inflation continued to fall short of their 2% target, the minutes said. “Various participants were concerned that indicators were suggesting that the level of longer-term inflation expectations was too low,” the record said.


  Policymakers were also optimistic about the labor market, with participants remarking on indications that the unemployment rate could fall further without putting pressure on inflation.


  “A number of participants noted that the labor force participation rate could rise further still,” the minutes said.


  Thirteen of 17 officials forecast leaving rates on hold in 2020, according to projections released at the last meeting, with four penciling in a quarter- point hike. A majority forecast at least one increase in 2021 and 2022. Not a single official forecast a rate cut in the next three years.

PULLMAN — Washington State didn’t let a sizable early deficit get out of hand. It didn’t entirely sputter in the face of its several injuries, or USC’s mass underneath, headlined by cream-of-the-crop recruits.


  The Cougars’ men’s basketball team hung around despite its deficiencies, and played fundamental, disciplined defense to counteract early jitters.


  But it just couldn’t get out of its own way offensively. It also couldn’t get much in the way of one guy who made the most difference — former five-star high school standout and Trojan freshman forward Onyeka Okongwu.


  Okongwu guided Southern California to its early lead, then stabilized the Trojans down the stretch in their 65-56 defeat of Wazzu during both teams’ Pac-12 opener Thursday in a louder-than-usual Beasley Coliseum.


  Okongwu scored 17 of his game-high 27 points in the second half and finished with 12 rebounds as the Trojans (12-2, 1-0 Pac-12) pulled away, getting help from a porous WSU offense.


  “It’s the kinda thing you can’t scout against,” Cougar coach Kyle Smith said of Okongwu, an NBA draft lottery prospect out of Chino Hills, Calif. “He’s just really good. ... He’s got good poise out there. I think Jeff (Pollard) would’ve been our best answer.”


  Pollard, WSU’s dependable senior post, was sidelined for all but the final two minutes of the game after he took a hard fall face-first about five minutes into the first half. He suffered a cheek-bone injury. Key guards Marvin Cannon and Jaylen Shead also sat with injuries.


  “We had to make some adjustments on the fly,” Smith said.


  The Cougars were spearheaded by Isaac Bonton’s 18 points on 7-of-26 shooting — the most attempts by a Coug in several years. WSU didn’t have enough offense to make a complete comeback after snipping USC’s advantage to one possession a few times in the second, when it was sparked by offensive boards (20), takeaways and quick transition buckets.


  Standout sophomore forward CJ Elleby had nine points on 3-of-22 from the field, and added 10 boards. The only stable contributor in the hasty-shooting offense, which heaved up 34 more shots than USC, was backup post Tony Miller, who chipped in 15 points on 7-of-11 shooting.


  “We defended well, we turned them over 20 times, we fought on the offensive glass,” Smith said. “The obvious elephant in the room — you can’t expect to win and shoot the way we did.


  “We gotta be a little more patient. I thought our guys were anxious.”


  WSU (9-5, 0-1) shot 27.8 percent, a season-low mark. It endured a few inopportune droughts, when USC stirred and incessantly fed Okongwu and his lengthy, 6-foot-9 frame down low.


  The Cougs’ brightest moment came with around eight minutes left, when Jervae Robinson gathered a loose ball and flew down the lane for a layin, then did the same right after, but this time fed Elleby for a breakaway slam, igniting the crowd and pulling WSU to 50-47 before a four-minute lull did the Cougs in.


  “We crawled back,” Smith said. “I don’t think we hung our heads. They’re just good.”


  The undersized Cougars went down by as many as 13 before the midway point of the first half. USC, one of the league’s biggest teams, controlled the glass, continuously procured fouls down low and made mincemeat of WSU’s frontcourt defense.


  But it didn’t last forever. WSU was resilient and made it a game after it looked far from it.


  Okongwu poured in a quick eight points and the Trojans shot out of the chutes, opening up — and making it look easy — a 20-7 advantage. During USC’s game-opening spurt, the Cougs scrambled badly on offense, thanks in part to USC’s physical lineup.


  “We took a big shot from SC early,” said Smith, who’s emphasized the importance of post play in the hulking conference. “We can be big; we gotta play big.”


  Wazzu didn’t get above the 30-percent mark from the floor until late in the second half. It was shooting 2-of-17 by the time USC hit its game-high edge.


  Somehow, the Cougars didn’t let the 13-point deficit get worse, and pulled within two just before intermission after a no-look feed off an offensive rebound by Noah Williams, who set up Miller for a dunk.


  Miller led the surge to keep it close. The Montana transfer tallied 10 points in the first half and was a workhorse on the glass, where he collected 11 total boards.


  “Might be a good time to consider starting Tony,” Smith said. “He gives us a quick, strong, athletic frontcourt guy.”


  WSU got grinder efforts all around on defense to stifle the Trojans, holding them without a field goal for almost seven minutes in the later stages of the first, during which USC turned it over 11 times.


  “Once we started getting our stops,” Robinson said, “we started getting going. Our offense wasn’t good tonight, but our defense kept us in the game.”

BOSTON - The Mass. Gaming Commission will begin looking for a new administrative head next week when Executive Director Edward Bedrosian leaves to pursue an opportunity in the private sector.
 Commission Chairwoman Cathy Judd-Stein announced Thursday that Bedrosian, who was hired by the commission in December 2015, will depart the commission after Friday, Jan. 10.
 Deputy Director Karen Wells, who leads the commission's Investigations and Enforcement Bureau, will serve as interim executive director while the commission searches for a replacement.
 "I was privileged these past four years to work with great Commissioners, past and present, to help lead a talented team of professionals who worked hard every day to open and regulate casinos, to license and register people in a new industry, to ensure diversity in both the construction and operations workforces, to establish responsible gaming and research on the impacts of introducing casino gambling into Massachusetts, and to create a transparent and inclusive work environment," Bedrosian said in a statement.
 Before being hired by the commission, Bedrosian served as first assistant attorney general and later was of counsel at the firm Orrick, Herrington and Sutcliffe. A former prosecutor who tried murder and white-collar crime cases in Middlesex County, he worked with the Legislature on gambling legislation, worked with the commission on its structure and early litigation, and established the attorney general's Division of Gaming Enforcement.
 The commission also interviewed chairman of the Maryland Amusement Game Advisory Committee Charles LaBoy for the position in 2015. The job opened up in the summer of 2015 when the commission's first executive director, Rick Day, announced his departure.
 At its public meeting on Jan. 9, Bedrosian's penultimate day on the job, the Gaming Commission is expected to "discuss the process for selecting a new executive director and ratify the selection of Director Wells as interim" leader of the agency. Wells, who played a key role in the commission's investigation of sexual misconduct allegations at Wynn Resorts and the company's handling of them, previously served as interim executive director before Bedrosian came aboard in 2015.
 "We are grateful that Director Wells will once again step forward and serve the Commission in an interim capacity," Judd-Stein said in a statement. "With seven years of experience at MGC and more than two decades in public service, she is a proven leader who has consistently demonstrated a strong understanding of MGC's regulatory role, core functions and agency values."
 Bedrosian is the second high-profile gaming official to step away from his post in recent weeks. Bob DeSalvio, who helped Wynn Resorts get its casino in Everett up and running as Encore Boston Harbor's president, left Wynn Resorts in December to oversee all operations at Resorts World Catskills and Resorts World Casino New York City for gaming giant Genting.

Oman’s success in terms of preventing their young subjects from leaving the sultanate to fight with global jihadist networks on the battlefields of Iraq and Syria, or waging “lone wolf” attacks in the Gulf Arab nation, is a notable achievement given the thriving radicalisation in the region.      Much of this success can be attributed to the nature of Oman’s foreign policy and the manner in which the nation has managed its own society.      Other Arab states can learn from Oman that the best way to prevent foreign meddling in their internal affairs is to accommodate all ethnic and religious groups to avoid granting outsiders opportunities to exploit tensions between regimes and historically marginalized communities.

 VIENNA, Jan 3 (Reuters) - Austrian opposition parties and environmental groups on Friday criticised a new coalition deal between conservatives and the Greens as heavy on the centre-right party's law-and-order agenda while delaying urgently needed action on climate change.
 Conservative leader Sebastian Kurz has touted his deal, which would reinstate him as chancellor and bring the left-wing Greens to power for the first time, as "the best of both worlds", combining both parties' core campaign pledges.
 The awkward alliance between ideological adversaries is being watched closely in Europe, particularly in Germany where similar voting patterns might make it a potential model for Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats after she retires.
 The deal must still be approved by a Greens party meeting on Saturday.
 "It is not the best of both worlds," the leader of the Social Democrats, Pamela Rendi-Wagner, told a news conference about the deal between Kurz's People's Party (OVP) and the Greens. "It is far more an OVP manifesto with Green camouflage."
 Many Greens balked at the deal, which retained much of the hard line on immigration and "political Islam" seen under Kurz's last coalition government with the far-right Freedom Party which collapsed in May.
 It includes extending a ban on headscarves in schools until the age of 14 from around 10 currently, as well as preventive custody for people deemed a threat to public safety even if they have not yet committed a crime.
 "It is painful for us that we could not prevail with what we would like to see here," Greens negotiator Sigi Maurer told news channel Puls 24 in a discussion with OVP negotiator August Woeginger, adding that the Greens were still "the party of human rights".
 When asked what in the deal was painful for the OVP, Woeginger said each party had stuck to its issues.
 On the environmental side, the deal includes measures such as increasing a tax on flights slightly and expanding the rail network. But the Greens' flagship policy of overhauling taxation to price in carbon emissions was put off until at least 2022.
 Greens leader Werner Kogler conceded on Thursday, as he and Kurz presented the deal, that the agreement reflected the power balance between the parties; his party won 13.9% of the vote in the Sept. 29 parliamentary election compared to the OVP's 37.5%.
 Greenpeace's Austria chief Alexander Egit bemoaned the delay in the taxation overhaul.
 "We don't have two years. The path to achieving (emissions) targets is getting steeper each year," he told ORF radio, while praising other parts of the deal.
 Few expect Saturday's meeting of the Greens' Federal Congress to block the deal, but it could raise questions about whether the coalition can last.
 Austria's officially recognised body representing Muslims was also unusually critical.
 "We would have expected of the Greens in government a course in line with human rights and the defence of equal treatment for all," it said in a statement. "The indiscriminate use of the term 'political Islam' stigmatises and criminalises all Muslims living in Austria across the board." (Reporting by Francois Murphy; Editing by Pravin Char)

BROWNSVILLE, Tenn. (AP) - A Tennessee teenager was arrested in connection to a shooting that killed a pregnant woman and her fetus, paralyzed her 8-year-old daughter and wounded another adult family member, authorities said.
 A 17-year-old boy was arrested Thursday and charged with two counts of first- degree murder and two counts of attempted first-degree murder, the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation said in a news release.
 The Associated Press does not generally identify juveniles who have been accused of crimes.
 On Dec. 1, the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation and officers from the Brownsville Police Department responded to a shooting where they found Alexis Branch, 24, dead at the scene, the bureau said. Branch was eight months pregnant and her fetus was also killed.
 Branch's 8-year-old daughter was shot and suffered paralysis over much of her body, investigators said. An unidentified adult family member received injuries that were not considered life threatening. A motive for the shooting was not immediately released. It was unclear whether the teenager had an attorney who could comment on his behalf.
