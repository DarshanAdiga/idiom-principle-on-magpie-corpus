And you know what, as unprepared as most fans watching and listening to the game were for that bizarre strategy, it was the right move.
 No, it wasn’t the right call because the Cajuns ended up winning the game 24-21 to record the program’s first win over Appalachian State in nine tries.
 It was the right decision in that moment for many reasons.
 Obviously in normal game conditions, taking the safety to reduce your lead to a field goal wouldn’t have even been considered.
 But this wasn’t your normal game. It was really cold and really wet and the wind only made the conditions worse.
 His normally-reliable snapper Paul Boudreaux was having the nightmare game of all nightmare games. At that point, he had snapped the ball over punter Rhys Byrns’ head three times and was high on two extra points.
 Going back to that well again with the game on the line just didn’t seem to make sense.

Mary P. (Noble) Jacobson      Appleton - Mary P. (Noble) Jacobson died from COVID-19, November 29, 2020 at Willow Lane Assisted Living just weeks before her 84th birthday. Mary was a kindhearted, sweet soul and a blessing to all who knew her. She loved people, friends and strangers alike. Her mother's hot fudge sauce, potato salad, spontaneous singing, corny one liners, gracious laughter, music on the stereo, concerts, the Guthrie Theatre, red Chevrolets and lipstick kisses are some of the memories we associate with Mary. Reading was a passion of hers, fueling her vast vocabulary and making her a formidable Scrabble opponent. Mary enjoyed fashion and always had her hair "just so", accessorizing with earrings and jewelry topped off with lipstick and a spritz of Estee Lauder perfume. The staff at Willow Lane always made sure that Mary looked her best, even at the end.      Mary worked at NSP (Xcel Energy) until she retired and it was here that she made lifelong, and true friends. She was involved in her church and valued the fellowship and friendships made at the Minnehaha Chapter No. 37 Order of the Eastern Star. She previously was an active member of the Minneapolis Women's Club and a docent at the Godfrey House.      Mary was preceded in death by her parents, brother (Duke), sister-in-law (Tracey) and husband Lloyd (Jake). She is survived by her nephew Carter (Carol) Noble, nieces Carla Noble and Neena (Mel) Brandl, step-daughters Cathy (Gary) Brunner and Deb (Chuck) Wallick, step-grandchildren, great nieces and nephews and their children as well as many faithful, loving friends.      Mary was compassionately cared for by the loving staff at Willow Lane these past 4 years, angels here on earth with the grateful assistance of Heartland Hospice the last week of her life. Mary brought much joy into all our lives and she will be sorely missed.      Remembrances can be made to Willow Lane Assisted Living 850 W. Elsner Ln. Appleton, WI 54913, the Alzheimer's Association, or to a charity helping "the least of these" at this challenging time of Covid-19. In light of current Covid concerns a celebration of life service will be held next summer in Minneapolis. To sign the guest book, please visit oconnellfh.com.

Reading the list of State Sen. Bill Monning's legislative and policy achievements in his farewell message to Herald readers is to be reminded how magnificently he served constituents of the 17th Senate District. Senator Monning has done so much to improve our quality of life, authoring bills ranging from environmental preservation to women's health and quality in the workplace to the protection of farmworkers. He has championed the arts, protected animals from abuse, and pioneered legislation to protect children's and public health. It is his signature achievement, however, the End of Life Option Act, that I will particularly remember, since I worked with him and his excellent staff as he patiently and effectively navigated the bill through a maze of opposition, including that from the Catholic Church. He has throughout demonstrated superb legislative skills while remaining patient, accessible, and courteous to the people who elected him. It should not be forgotten that he had an opportunity to run for a congressional seat that he would have easily attained but chose instead to remain in the State Senate seat to which we elected him. We have had the benefit of his singular dedication and talent for a long time, yet not long enough. Whatever he chooses to do next, he will find a dedicated constituency to support him. While we say goodbye to a talented and compassionate legislator, we welcome a talented and compassionate fellow citizen. Few will be able to replace him.

La cripta di San Benedetto, nei sotterranei di ciò che resta della Basilica di Norcia, è stata messa in sicurezza con un intreccio di tubi d'acciaio chiamati a sorreggere le mura e la storia che qui narra la nascita del santo patrono d'Europa. Nonostante siano state completamente distrutte dal crollo del campanile, le mura sono avvolte da un alone di spiritualità che si avverte già scendendo le prime scale. Sulle pareti, per l'oscurità del luogo, si intravedono a malapena gli affreschi antichi e quello scoperto di recente, ma la luce degli smartphone, puntata sui capolavori, ne fa scorgere in parte tutta la bellezza. Che l'ANSA ha potuto ammirare da vicino entrando all'interno della Basilica, per poi scendere nella cripta e quindi affacciarsi, a debita distanza, sull'antico monastero ancora pericolante.   E' stato possibile grazie alla Soprintendenza alle Belle arti dell'Umbria.   A spiegare come si è arrivati allo svuotamento totale delle macerie e indicare il percorso che porterà alla ricostruzione della "casa" di Benedetto, è stato l'ingegnere Giuseppe Lacava, funzionario della stessa Soprintendenza, nonché direttore dei lavori che hanno portato - 4 anni dopo il sisma - alla completa messa in sicurezza della Basilica. "Quando siamo entrati subito dopo il terremoto - ricorda Lacava - ci siamo trovati di fronte un muro di macerie e reperti di grande valore alto anche 4 metri. Nei giorni scorsi - aggiunge - abbiamo ultimato l'ultima fase di svuotamento, quella forse più complicata dato che siamo intervenuti nella cripta". "Qui - spiega il tecnico - abbiamo dovuto ricostruire il solaio anche in previsione della ricostruzione". "Le tre fasi che hanno portato allo svuotamento e alla messa in sicurezza della Basilica - aggiunge l'ingegnere - sono state propedeutiche anche per mettere immediatamente a disposizione dei progettisti l'edificio e quindi procedere alla cantierizzazione". "Intanto - ricorda - sono stati individuati da parte della Soprintendenza speciale i professionisti e a breve ci sarà il passaggio di testimone dalla fase della messa in sicurezza alla vera e propria ricostruzione". Se il 2021 sarà l'anno dell'avvio dei lavori al momento resta un "augurio" per il tecnico, "ma - dice - già sarebbe un risultato importante arrivare al progetto definitivo". Per vedere la Basilica ricostruita servirà, invece, attendere qualche anno. In attesa che la ricostruzione prenda forma, non resta, allora, che ammirare da vicino il pavimento riemerso dalle macerie, ciò che resta di uno dei due altari, il confessionale in legno, gli affreschi scampati al terremoto e i candelabri impolverati sistemati su un soppalco ricavato in uno degli accessi che portano alla cripta. Tesori a cui si aggiunge un crocifisso in metallo in cui Cristo si è staccato dalla croce ed è rimasto a testa in giù. Come a testimoniare quanto violenta era stata la scossa che tutto distrusse. (ANSA).

Stoke boss Michael O’Neill praised the character of his side after holding on to a 1-0 win at home to Middlesbrough.
 Nathan Collins headed Stoke ahead after 19 minutes and Boro’s best chance came when George Saville hit the post after 39 minutes.
 “It was a competitive game today and we had to make three subs due to injury,” said O’Neill.
 “The most important thing was that we were still strong enough to defend our lead.
 “We had chances at the end to kill it off and looked a threat on the break.
 “We defended well and it is a good three points.
 “The teams were very competitive today, but that is the nature of this league.
 “It is pleasing that the younger players stood up and dealt with the physical side of the game to see it out.
 “Our team was disrupted by the subs due to injuries, but we showed great character to see the game out.
 “Our squad is stretched now. I don’t think the challenges deserved more than a yellow card. We just came out of it on the wrong side of things.
 “It was a very physical game as many games are in this league, it was just the nature of the game.
 “Boro will have come here knowing a win put them above us, so it was important we tried to stop their momentum and pick points up ourselves.
 “There will be a lot of games like that to the end of the season.”
 Boro boss Neil Warnock admitted his side had lacked the necessary quality.
 “I thought the players gave me everything,” he said.
 “I’m disappointed with the goal we conceded. There wasn’t communication and we should have stopped the ball coming in and not left the man unmarked.
 “Apart from that we lacked quality in the final third, but I think both teams did.
 “Once Stoke went in front they defended well and with men behind the ball so we needed something special to unlock them.
 “We just weren’t good enough today but I can’t fault the effort.”
 But Warnock was left fuming at what he saw as a 'disgraceful’ dressing room.
 “We were in a pig sty around the corner here,” he added.
 “We had fumes coming in the dressing room and had to get the maintenance men out. The toilets didn’t work, we give them everything at our place.
 “The showers were leaking and there’s water everywhere. It is a disgrace today

London, (APP - UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 5th Dec, 2020 ) :Fans of English Championship club Millwall appeared to boo as players took a knee in support of the fight against racial injustice on Saturday.
 In footage seen on social media, booing from the stands at the London-based club is heard after referee Darren England blew his whistle for the players to make the gesture.
 Players at Premier League and English Football League games have been taking a knee since football restarted in June following the coronavirus shutdown.
 Only 2,000 spectators were allowed inside the ground for Saturday's second- tier match between Millwall and Derby due to Covid-19 restrictions.
 Fans of Millwall, who in the past gained a reputation for violence, revel in their unpopularity.
 Ahead of the game, the topic of players taking a knee was discussed on Millwall's fans forum and the first-team squad said in a statement on the club's website that they supported efforts to end discrimination.
 "We wish to make clear that taking the knee, for us, is in no way representative of any agreement with political messaging or ideology," it added.

 Earlier in the day, thousands of people gathered in the Freedom Square in Yerevan to call on Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan to step down.� People protest against what they consider unfavorable terms of the Nagorno-Karabakh peace deal that Pashinyan signed last month on the back of a 1.5-month armed conflict with Azerbaijan.�
 "This document works, we cannot change it or abandon it. This would mean a war with Azerbaijan and Turkey and a confrontation with Russian peacekeepers," Manukyan said at the opposition rally.

DETROIT (AP) — Kia is recalling nearly 295,000 vehicles in the U.S. because the engines can stall or catch fire.The recall comes just a week after Kia and affiliated Korean automaker Hyundai were fined by the U.S. government for allegedly delaying recalls.The recall covers certain 2012 and 2013 Sorento SUVs, 2012 through 2015 Forte and Forte Koup cars, and 2011 through 2013 Optima Hybrid cars. Also included are 2014 and 2015 Soul SUVs and 2012 Sportage SUVs.Kia says in documents posted Saturday by the U.S. government that no manufacturing defect has been found, but it’s recalling the vehicles to mitigate any risk of fire. The recall comes after the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration began investigating Kia and Hyundai engine fires in 2019. The agency opened the probe after the nonprofit Center for Auto Safety filed a petition seeking the investigation. When the inquiry began, the agency said it had owner complaints of more than 3,100 fires, 103 injuries and one death.Kia will notify owners starting Jan. 27. Dealers will inspect the engines for fuel or oil leaks and replace them if necessary. The company also is developing a knock sensor software update.Last week, the NHTSA announced that Kia and Hyundai must pay $137 million in fines and for safety improvements because they moved too slowly to recall more than 1 million vehicles with engines that can fail. The fines resolve a three-year government probe into the companies’ behavior involving recalls of multiple models dating to the 2011 model year.Kia must pay $27 million and invest $16 million on safety performance measures. Another $27 million payment will be deferred as long as Kia meets safety conditions, the NHTSA said.Kia denied the U.S. allegations but said it wanted to avoid a protracted legal fight. Engine failure and fire problems with Hyundais and Kias have plagued the companies for more than five years. Copyright 2020 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

They began seeing each other secretly, and eventually confessed their feelings for one another. "We were in Laredo when we had our conversation about how we both felt the same way about each other. Selena had the biggest smile on her face when we were walking back to the bus afterward...I wanted to tell her, 'Hey, quit smiling! You're going to give it away,'" Perez told _Texas Monthly_. __
 After a long build-up, Selena and Perez had their first kiss near their tour bus (nicknamed "Big Bertha") --and were caught by band member, Rick. He warned Perez that he needed to be careful Abraham not find out.
 ## As _Selena_ shows, __Abraham opposed their relationship.
 Abraham Quintanilla had a strong presence in Selena and Perez's young romance. There forever loomed the threat of being caught. In his book, Perez explained that Abraham's "word was law" for his family--and the law, for Selena, was no dating Chris.
 Speaking to _Texas Monthly_, Abraham explained his opposition to Selena dating: "I saw him as a threat. What if they got married and he pulled her out of the band? All the work we did all those years would go down the tubes." Perez responded to those fears in his book by writing, "I was ready to support Selena in whatever she wanted to do. But he didn't know that."
 The guitarist's brush-up with the law and his party with the road crew, which he described in his book, probably didn't help Abraham's perception of Perez. "He has nothing to offer you," Perez recalled Abraham telling Selena.

Llanelli, United Kingdom, Dec 5 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 6th Dec, 2020 ) :Wales were given a major fright before beating Italy 38-18 at Llanelli on Saturday to finish fifth in the Autumn Nations Cup.
 Wales looked set for a comfortable victory after surging into an early 14-0 lead on the back of maiden Test tries by Kieran Hardy and Sam Parry, with fly- half Callum Sheedy converting both scores.
 But Italy, without a win over one of their Six Nations rivals in five years, hit back to lead 18-17 following tries either side of half-time by centre Marco Zanon and flanker Johan Meyer.
 Wales replacement scrum-half Gareth Davies settled home nerves, however, with a well-taken converted try that put them 24-18 up heading into the final quarter.
 George North then powered over for his 41st Test try and 10th against Italy to put the result beyond doubt 11 minutes from time, with impressive flanker Justin Tipuric's score late on tough on Italy.
 The victory in their last match of 2020 was just Wales' third win in 10 Tests under head coach Wayne Pivac and their second over Italy, following a 42-10 Six Nations rout in February.
 Wales were forced into a late change when centre Johnny Williams withdrew shortly before kick-off with a calf injury, his place taken by Scarlets team- mate Jonathan Davies.
 Pivac, who has repeatedly stressed the importance of this tournament in developing squad depth ahead of the 2023 World Cup in France, had already made nine changes following last week's 24-13 home loss to England.
 Meanwhile, Wales captain Alun Wyn Jones extended his own Test appearance world record to 152 caps.
 It took Wales just seven minutes to break the deadlock, with No 8 Taulupe Faletau sending the fit-again Tipuric through a hole in the defence before the openside flanker released Hardy, who just did enough to ground the ball over the try-line.

Per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (“PFAS”) are a class of over 7,000 manmade compounds.?Chemists at 3M and Dupont developed the initial PFAS chemicals by accident in the 1930s when researching carbon-based chemical reactions. During one such experiment, an unusual coating remained in the testing chamber, which upon further testing was completely resistant to any methods designed to break apart the atoms within the chemical. The material also had the incredible ability to repel oil and water. Dupont later called this substance PFOA (perfluorooctanoic acid), the first PFAS ever invented. After World War II, Dupont commercialized PFOA into the revolutionary product that the company branded “Teflon.”

Federal officials estimate about 40 million vaccines will be available by the end of the month if both Moderna and Pfizer get US Food and Drug Administration authorization -- only enough to vaccinate 20 million people, because two doses are needed for each person.
 But even that number will fall short. Pfizer is only expected to have 6.4 million doses of vaccine ready by mid-December.
 A CNN analysis of 27 states' vaccine data showed that none were getting enough vaccine in the first shipment to vaccinate all their first priority group, including health care workers and long-term care residents. CNN was able to confirm the expected size of the first shipment of vaccine for at least 45 states, and the number of people prioritized in a least 27 states.
 Now states must decide how they will ration the vaccine among their top priority groups and how the small first installment affects the timetable of when groups down the line can be vaccinated. Some states are already being forced to triage -- choosing which health care workers are a higher priority than others.
 California must vaccinate 2.4 million healthcare workers first and Gov. Gavin Newsom said earlier this week that the state is only receiving 327,000 doses of the vaccine from Pfizer to start with.
 Since that covers just a fraction of the healthcare workers needed to get vaccinated, Newsom said Thursday the state would be trimming its list of top priority group of healthcare workers even further to decide who gets vaccinated first.
 "It's one thing when you hear the national news about, well, we broadly all agree that our healthcare workers and skilled nursing residential care and assisted living facilities should be prioritized, but that is millions and millions of people. When you only have a few hundred thousand doses of vaccines -- doses, you need two doses -- you can cut that in half in terms of the total number of people that actually will be fully vaccinated. We have to look at some prioritization of those doses, and we've done just that," Newsom said Thursday.

You can understand other countries and cultures if you hang out with those guys, if you don’t just meet them in the office. In a bar or a restaurant, that’s where you have the best meetings sometimes. It’s beneficial for people to see other parts of the world and find a better understanding.

 Burrell weighed in on how the Netflix drama portrayed Prince Charles and Princess Diana's relationship, and how the ever-so-wonderful Josh O'Connor got Charles' right. In an interview with _The Sun_, Burrell said, "Josh O'Connor plays Prince Charles as a rather uncaring, cold person. And I'm afraid that's what I saw behind closed doors." Burrell continued saying: "He was married to probably the most beautiful woman in the world. But he didn't look after her, and that's what comes across in _The Crown_."

Tony Hsieh’s life behind the scenes


--DocBreak--
Europe's nations are struggling to reconcile cold medical advice with a tradition that calls for big gatherings in often poorly ventilated rooms, where people chat, shout and sing together — providing an ideal conduit for a virus that has killed over 350,000 people in the continent so far. These weeks it is the No. 1 cause of death in the European Union.


  Yet the desire for contact with family is such that all the horrible realities can be briefly sidelined. In France, it took a letter addressed to Santa Claus to put it in perspective.


  A year of pandemic and lockdown had weighed so much on a 22-year-old student, that as a grown adult he rekindled his youth and wrote again to the jolly children's saint.


  "For the end of this year, I'd simply like the family whose name I proudly bear to be reunited, and things to progressively return to normal," wrote Alexis — Santa letters don't usually involve a surname.


  If families have not lost close ones to the pandemic, many have been unable to meet for much of the year when distancing had to do the job that, hopefully, vaccines will do in 2021. Often grandparents could not see their grandchildren, and family functions — even weddings or funerals — required minute planning and heart-wrenching choices on who would be excluded.


  Hence the groundswell to hit the pause button, even for just a few days.


  Britain, with the continent's highest death rate at 57,031 yet a Christmas tradition unlike few others, could not resist the temptation of relaxation.


  People are currently barred from visiting other households in much of the U.K and there are travel limits to high-infection areas.


  All that will go overboard for five days over the holidays, when up to three households can form a "Christmas bubble" and members can move freely between them. Cabinet Minister Michael Gove spoke of the need to "offer hope for families and friends who have made many sacrifices over this difficult year."


  At the same time, hospital and care home staff across Europe feel that their many sacrifices could be in vain if rules are eased too much. After all, this fall's resurgence followed similar relaxations over the summer.


  Although the European Union has no direct say in national Christmas restrictions, EU Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen, a former doctor, urged caution until vaccines become widely available.


  "We must learn from the summer and not repeat the same mistakes," she said. "Relaxing too fast and too much risks a third wave after Christmas."

Coventry boss Mark Robins insisted his Sky Blues have not “cracked” the Sky Bet Championship yet despite extending their unbeaten run to five games with an impressive 3-1 win over Rotherham.
 Early goals from Max Biamou and Tyler Walker set Coventry on course for victory at St Andrew’s as they won the battle of the promoted sides to move six points clear of the relegation zone.
 Leo Ostigard’s second-half header secured the points before Daniel Barlaser’s late penalty earned the Millers a consolation.
 Robins was delighted with his side’s display, particularly front two Biamou and Walker, but believes the Sky Blues are far from the finished article.
 “The three points was a big, big three points for us. From a confidence point of view, and the fact that we’ve gone five unbeaten, it’s very pleasing,” Robins admitted.
 “Wins breed confidence, unbeaten runs breed confidence but I’m not saying we’ve cracked it because this league is unforgiving – unless you’re right on it, you don’t win.
 “We’re just making our way, nobody gets carried away – you can’t because this league is difficult and the games are coming that thick and fast you just have to keep going.
 “We’ve got good players, really important key members of our starting XI and certainly the squad, that are missing. So once we get everybody fit, we will see a different dynamic as well.”
 Walker set up Biamou’s cool finish for the opener and then tucked home himself, slotting in the rebound after Callum O’Hare hit the post.
 They could each have added to their tally as Walker was denied by Millers keeper Jamal Blackman who also tipped a Biamou overhead kick on to the post.
 “I think the front two were fantastic. They led the line and gave us a chance to build and their finishes were outstanding,” added Robins.
 “I thought we were brilliant. They are a really difficult side to play against and we stood up to the challenge and not only that, we played some really good stuff.”
 Ostigard headed home Gustavo Hamer’s free-kick to ensure a sixth defeat in eight for the Millers before Barlaser slammed in a late penalty after Coventry keeper Ben Wilson caught Kyle Vassell.
 That was not enough to placate Rotherham boss Paul Warne, who said: “They were superior to us in every department which hurts me to say.
 “It was a bad day. Their victory, although we missed chances late on, could have been greater.
 “I thought we started really well and looked well in the ascendancy.
 “Then one ball in causes confusion with the centre-halves and we just didn’t defend it and after that we were on a rocky road.
 “It’s not like us to be beaten up a little bit but I thought today we were.
 “I was happy to get in at half-time at 2-0 because it could have been more and at the start of the second half there was a bit more drive and effort.
 “But I honestly didn’t think we were going to score. We weren’t creating enough chances. Overall the result probably flatters us.
 “I said to the lads after the game that I would do anything for them and I expect it back. I just didn’t think that we were aggressive enough. I can handle losing, I don’t like it – but I can’t handle a poor performance.”

BOSTON - Just like a real-life movie, the story of Buddy the Elf meeting his biological father has come to life, just in time for the holidays.
 Doug Henning wore a costume like the one actor Will Ferrell’s character wore in “Elf” while meeting his father face to face for the first time last week at Boston's Logan Airport. He even broke into the same awkward song from the 2003 movie — sample lyrics: “I’m here, with my dad. And we never met, and he wants me to sing him a song!”
 "When he came out of the airport, he probably thought I was a lunatic," Henning, 43, of Eliot, Maine, told Boston.com. "It was a really good way to break the ice."
 His biological father didn't get the joke because he hadn't seen the movie, which is about a man raised at the North Pole who meets his dad for the first time. But that didn't stop him from giving his son a big hug.

Two weeks after making the decision to hold the first part of the 2020-21 winter sports season without spectators, the Kansas State High School Activities Association's Board of Directors will get to make that decision all over again.
   
 On Friday, KSHSAA's Appeal Board voted 7-1 to approve a proposal to allow spectators, namely parents or guardians, to attend high school events this winter. The proposal will be brought before the board of directors in a special 1 p.m. meeting next Tuesday.
   
 "I think they got (Items) 8 and 9 totally wrong, I really do," said Appeal Board member Jeff Koelzer, who is from Onaga and represents Congressional District 1. "I think they will watch this appeals meeting and listen to us and the thousands of emails and letters and come back with local control or just parents. I think that's just what has to be done with this."
   
 At last week's KSHSAA Board of Directors meeting, the board went against the recommendations of the KSHSAA staff and executive board to delay competition in winter activities until after Jan. 14, instead allowing the seasons to begin as regularly scheduled.
   
 At the same time, however, the board passed a mandate that those competitions at both the high-school and middle-school levels be held without spectators in attendance.
   
 The decision created an uproar across the state, particularly from parents who would be denied from watching their sons or daughters compete or perform.
   
 At Friday's appeals meeting, two of the appellants spoke on behalf of parents across the state who deemed that decision unjust.
   
 "We all received almost 1,000 pages of emails and parents sent to KSHSAA of concerned parents, grandparents, health care professionals, school board members, students and even entire school districts regarding the elimination of spectators from all winter sports," said Alyssa Boaz, an Erie resident who appeared along with her husband, Chad (president of the Erie school board), and has two high school and one middle school student-athletes. "The overall consensus came down to a request for parents to be allowed and a return to local control. ... In my first email, I wrote, I would implore you to stop considering 'One size fits all' solutions. That should be rule No. 1 when it comes to making any school-related decisions. The sizes and needs of schools and communities in this state are simply not the same.
   
 "And that's where we are again, asking you to allow local school administrators, school boards and health officials -- people with boots on the ground -- to determine how to safely get parents in and decide the best course of action for each individual school."
   
 She added, "There is currently no evidence that shows that sitting in a school gymnasium with a mask and separated from others outside your own family group is more dangerous than a hair appointment, eating in a restaurant, shopping for groceries or going to church. It is commonly accepted science nationwide, including the current Kansas governor's administration that wearing a mask and social distancing greatly reduce the risk of spreading or contracting COVID-19. Unless KSHSAA has data disputing that social distancing and masks are not effective then it is simply ignoring commonly accepted science and punishing the participants and families of Kansas students. ...
   
 "We feel it is the job of KSHSAA to offer guidance and recommendation, not a blanket restriction. The ruling should be left to local officials."
   
 Boaz was followed by Macksville resident Kayla Burr, who shared her disdain for the "one size fits all" approach to spectator allowance and agreed on local control for such determinations.
   
 Burr called for the admittance of at least one parent, preferably two, to competitions with risk mitigation strategies being followed strictly.
   
 "I was disappointed to see members voting to pass the buck that it's a KSHSAA ruling so they don't have to do their job in enforcing the rules," Burr said. "It's simply easier with a statewide ban. I felt some members of the board lost their objectivity to KSHSAA as a board member and got too personal in the way they voted. I know it's not a fun job. I know it's a difficult conversation to have with a parent who won't follow the rules. But everyone has something about their job that isn't fun and it's simply easier to just eliminate it. We've got to be willing to have those difficult conversations and lead our kids by example."
   
 Burr also talked about a liability aspect coaches and administrators now find themselves dealing with as the lone adults at competitions.
   
 "You've just dumped the entire responsibility of a team on a coach," Burr said. "These kids need their parents."
   
 In closing, Burr said, "If we are masking and masking works, why is this even an issue? ... This isn't a student issue, it's an adult issue. Let the adults make their own choices since they are adults. We know the rules. We know the risks."
   
 Ulysses Superintendent Dave Younger completed the appellant presentations and expressed his desire to be a voice for "kids, parents and school administrators and staff." He said his league, the Great West Activities Conference, was united in its belief that schools should be the ones making the decisions. (The league was one of the 26 'No' votes at last week's board meeting.
   
 "March 2020 brought a new change in education for us -- something we've never experienced," Younger said. "We followed the guidance from the 'Navigating Change' document and something my father would say was common sense. We were told to work with county health departments and have done that every step of the way. We've pivoted when we needed to. ... And we're prepared to change when we need to.
   
 "We've already prepared to limit access to winter activities, but it was a local decision. ... We did it in football, volleyball and cross country and we can do it this winter."
   
 After the appellants made their presentations, KSHSAA executive director Bill Faflick was given the opportunity to present the views from his staff that led to the original proposal to not only not allow spectators at winter events until Jan. 28, but also to delay the start of the competition season until Jan. 15.
   
 Faflick cited the numerous meetings with the KSHSAA's Sports Medicine Advisory Committee and also presented data on the increased numbers of COVID-19 cases in Kansas. He held firm in the staff's belief that reducing the number of opportunities for gatherings of large numbers of people was vital to slow the spread of COVID-19.
   
 "Our board looked at turning down the dial or turning off the dial, which would mean we would have no activities," Faflick said. "No one had the appetite for that. The desire to have kids in activities, benefiting and growing, turning it down significantly was an important step they made.
   
 "It's not popular and we understand that. But we don't make popular decisions, we make decisions that are rooted in science, rooted in best practice and the advice of experts that we count on."
   
 Following dialogue between the appeal board members, asking questions of both Faflick and the appellants, and giving the appellants a final word, each board member got to voice their opinion on the matter.
   
 Most agreed that they were dealing with "angels on each shoulder," seeing both sides of the argument with the same conviction of those that were making those arguments.
   
 "It's a balance of thoughts," Riverside Superintendent Travis Githens said. "Everywhere we turn with COVID-19 there are problems and everywhere we turn we make the right answer and the wrong answer. There is no right or wrong answer with all of this, there's just an answer and it's painful for everyone involved with this."
   
 Added board member Sonya Martin, of Garnett-Anderson County, "The last thing we want is to impact our kids more than we already have. ... This is a huge decision because of the public health issue that we have in front of us."
   
 After all eight board members had their final say, Lyons Superintendent Bill Day made a motion.
   
 "Because masks are already required for attendance at KSHSAA events and because science tells us that proper mask-wearing and social distancing effectively mitigates the risk of transmitting COVID-19 and because I believe parents need to be at their children's events, I propose that the KSHSAA board of directors reconvene for the purpose of considering the decision to prohibit spectators at school events through Jan. 28, 2021, with a recommendation of to allow for attendance of one or two parents per athlete."
   
 The motion was seconded by Githens and then put to a roll call vote, passing 7-1 with Blue Valley's Tom Mitchell the lone dissenter.

From his research, he said armadillos in Georgia have stopped short of passing through the mountains, not because of difficulty with the elevation, but because of the cold weather.


  Garrett Hibbs, Hall County UGA cooperative extension agent, said armadillos don’t tolerate temperatures below 36 degrees well, nor do they like temperatures above 85.


  “I know with at least the university, they see the most northern point in Rome (for armadillo populations), and we’re (Hall) at the same latitude as them. They don’t really hibernate, so they have to stay active all year long.”


  Neuhauser said he has noticed that rivers can act as both a barrier and a path for armadillos moving north. In Glynn, he said the mammals took around a year to successfully move past the Altamaha River and into McIntosh County. However, he said when they came into Athens, he thinks they traveled up the river corridors — the land area adjacent to the river.


  “This provided them with basically unimpeded access,” Neuhauser said. “When they started showing up in Athens, they started showing up around the rivers.”

Austin, 21, has reportedly told his Sydney grade club Sutherland he won’t be playing for a while as he takes time out to rediscover his passion for cricket, according to Sharks captain and Sydney Sixers paceman Ben Dwarshuis.

Get your 14-day free trial &amp; start streaming instantly &gt; “He wasn’t that interested in playing this year and wanted to spend a little bit of time away from it,” Dwarshuis told The Sunday Telegraph.“He’s a great player with a lot of potential but you never want to push someone to play.“The game can take its toll and having Waugh as a surname just adds that little bit of extra pressure.“I think he’s enjoying a bit of time away. Hopefully he takes a year off and comes back refreshed and loving his cricket again.”Austin has represented NSW under-age sides and also played for the Australian Under-19s as he followed in his father’s footsteps, showing remarkable similarities to his dad as the talented all-rounder forged a career of his own. His batting in particular reminded plenty of good judges of Steve, who played 168 Tests for Australia, captaining his country 57 times for 41 wins.In 2016, former South Australian wicketkeeper and then-Cricket Australia pathways manager Graham Manou, noticed the similarities immediately.“It was very scary, the first time I saw him, his mannerisms,” Manou said. “Genetically, I suppose you’d expect (it) but it’s like he’s watched a tape of his old man for years. They’re very, very similar.”Austin was on hand as a substitute fielder for Australia during the fourth Test against India in the 2018-19 summer and has previously played down expectations that naturally come with his surname, and also tried to distance his game from his dad.“I think our batting styles are pretty different, but our bowling is a bit similar,” Austin said in 2018. “We have a few similarities, but on the whole, I’m a pretty different player to him.“He (Steve) is always going to be there, people are going to have an interest in him, being the player that he was. I’ll just keep focusing on my game, I am not worried about that.”

Since being furloughed in the spring from her sales job at a company that makes fire doors, Paaske, 56, has cut back her grocery budget. She thought she’d be called back to work once the virus waned. But when her boss phoned in August, it was with a different message: Her job had been eliminated.


  Paaske had hesitated to spend the $360 it would cost to euthanize her 15-year old dog, who had a brain tumor, before going through with it. Without unemployment aid, Paaske isn’t sure how she would manage. She may seek financial help from her parents, who are in their 80s, something she has resisted doing. If she doesn’t find a job by March, she said, she’ll stop leasing her car.


  Across the country, a cutoff of jobless aid would disproportionately affect Black Americans, according to the Century Foundation. About 18% of unemployment aid recipients are Black, the foundation said, though Black Americans make up just 12% of the workforce. More than 57% of recipients are white. Nearly 13% are Latino. (There is no demographic data on about one-fifth of recipients.)

The Wichita State men's basketball team will play with just eight scholarship players for the second straight game to open the season when the Shockers take on Missouri at 1 p.m. Sunday in Koch Arena.
 WSU was without five scholarship players and all three walk-ons for its 85-80 victory over Oral Roberts on Wednesday. Their absence stemmed from a mixture of positive COVID-19 tests and exposure dating back to last Monday, which forced the Shockers to exit the Crossover Classic tournament in South Dakota.
 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been recommending a 14-day quarantine following exposure, but this week announced shortened alternatives -- a 7-day quarantine with a negative test or a 10-day quarantine without a test -- for asymptomatic people. That gave hope to WSU fans that a handful of the five Shockers missing from the season opener could make their debut on Sunday for the ESPN2 broadcast.
 But those changes have yet to be adopted by the American Athletic Conference, which means the Shockers will once again be without guards Craig Porter, Chauncey Jenkins and Ricky Council and forwards Josaphat Bilau and Jaden Seymour. The only addition will be walk-on Jacob Herrs for Sunday's game against Missouri.
 A spokesperson for the AAC said he expects the conference will follow suit, but because the changes were made official fewer than three days ago, the conference's Medical Advisory Group has yet to convene to make the formal adjustment.

Our eyes and ears into a world that we do not understand, Kitty is just as puzzled as we are by the games afoot and calculated insinuations that all is not as it seems. We follow along with her as she discovers the strange trails of blood mar the corridors and uncovers the strange rituals and symbols drawn into the backs of pages and palms. This author presents a new style of mystery novel, that is made all the more enigmatic by the fact that Kitty is an unreliable narrator. Constantly out of the loop, she is telling this story retrospectively and seems keen to redeem herself in this dark narrative. She is determined to come across as innocent in all the ploys playing out around her and yet she never seems gives us whole story or fully reveal herself. Keen to down-play certain aspects and hype up other ones, she points her finger in almost every direction but herself.

We had two penalties that could have been given against us on Wednesday night so it is disappointing.


  The lads worked so hard. Two major things: the team has got used to losing and not grinding it out if they have to. I don't think we ground it out today. I thought we played some good stuff


  But when the pressure starts, people have got to be a lot more composed on the ball. We gave the ball away too many times when there were simple passes.


  Joey [Pelupessy] came on and kicked two out of touch when he had simple passes. They have got to understand and recognise that they get paid to defend and defend well, which we didn't for Norwich's two goals, but we also have to be as resilient and strong in possession. When we were, we caused them problems.


  In the last 10 minutes to quarter of an hour, for some reason, they got really uptight and instead of getting the pass off they were just prepared to kick it back to Norwich.


  We had to make substitutions and they have not made us stronger.

The assassination of Black Panther Illinois Chairman Fred Hampton was introduced up briefly in _The Trial of the Chicago 7_ , however one of the vital surprising occasions (and what led to it) within the Metropolis of Chicago within the second half of the twentieth Century will likely be examined completely within the upcoming drama _Judas and the Black Messiah_. In the upcoming Shaka King-directed venture, Daniel Kaluuya will play the late Fred Hampton main as much as his homicide following an FBI investigation that concerned Williams O'Neal (Lakeith Stanfield), a criminal-turned-informant who went undercover within the Black Panther Celebration. _Judas and the Black Messiah_ was initially supposed to come back out on August 20, 2020, however it's now being launched in some unspecified time in the future in 2021.

Alex Neil rued Preston’s missed opportunities in their 2-2 draw with Wycombe.
 Neil’s men started the season with five successive defeats at Deepdale and their desperate home form looked set to worsen when Garath McCleary and Scott Kashket struck.
 But Jason McCarthy’s own goal on 87 minutes denied the visitors a first win in six and saw the Lilywhites collect a fourth home point of the campaign from a possible 24.
 “I thought we were good and looked dangerous, but when Ben (Pearson) went off (with injury) it affected us," said Neil.
 “I thought losing him was a big blow for us, certainly in terms of how we wanted to play. We just missed him on the pitch.
 “Once he went off we probably lacked a bit of courage on the ball.
 “But we just didn’t move the ball well enough. When you do move the ball well then you can pick them off.
 “We switched off for their second goal and then you know it’s going to be tough.
 “We went direct at the end and got the goal. After that we got two really good chances to get the win.
 “Did we deserve to win the game? No.
 “If you’re going to win these types of games you’ve got to take those opportunities."
 The opening goal of a helter-skelter contest came when Tom Barkhuizen scored his fourth goal in five games, capitalising on a poor headed back pass from Josh Knight.
 Pearson then limped off with a freak injury after he collapsed to the ground clutching his knee with no player nearby.
 The visitors levelled just three minutes into the second half as McCleary powered home from a tight angle.
 Kashket put them in front, coolly slotting home for his first goal in a month when left-back Joe Jacobson’s thunderbolt free-kick struck the left upright.
 But there was a late twist when McCarthy somehow deflected Sinclair’s cross into his own net.
 Wycombe boss Gareth Ainsworth said: “We feel like we’ve lost the game, which for me is a big positive. It’s another really competitive point away in the Championship.
 “To say Wycombe has come away to Preston and felt like we’ve lost, when in fact we’ve got a draw, is a real positive.
 “We’ve been more than competitive and probably done more than enough to win the game.
 “Their equaliser is just unfortunate, it’s a deflection, but going forward I thought in the second half we were very good.
 “We had a lot of chances and probably had the two best chances of the game. We didn’t put them in, but on another day we probably see the game out. I’m really pleased with the boys.
 “We were in the driving seat, but the character we’ve shown is what we need to stay in this division.
 “We’ve got the belief and I think we’ve got the ability to stay in the division."

Mary P. (Noble) Jacobson Appleton - Mary P. (Noble) Jacobson died from COVID-19, November 29, 2020 at Willow Lane Assisted Living just weeks before her 84th birthday. Mary was a kindhearted, sweet soul and a blessing to all who knew her. She loved people, friends and strangers alike. Her mother's hot fudge sauce, potato salad, spontaneous singing, corny one liners, gracious laughter, music on the stereo, concerts, the Guthrie Theatre, red Chevrolets and lipstick kisses are some of the memories we associate with Mary. Reading was a passion of hers, fueling her vast vocabulary and making her a formidable Scrabble opponent. Mary enjoyed fashion and always had her hair "just so", accessorizing with earrings and jewelry topped off with lipstick and a spritz of Estee Lauder perfume. The staff at Willow Lane always made sure that Mary looked her best, even at the end. Mary worked at NSP (Xcel Energy) until she retired and it was here that she made lifelong, and true friends. She was involved in her church and valued the fellowship and friendships made at the Minnehaha Chapter No. 37 Order of the Eastern Star. She previously was an active member of the Minneapolis Women's Club and a docent at the Godfrey House. Mary was preceded in death by her parents, brother (Duke), sister-in-law (Tracey) and husband Lloyd (Jake). She is survived by her nephew Carter (Carol) Noble, nieces Carla Noble and Neena (Mel) Brandl, step-daughters Cathy (Gary) Brunner and Deb (Chuck) Wallick, step-grandchildren, great nieces and nephews and their children as well as many faithful, loving friends. Mary was compassionately cared for by the loving staff at Willow Lane these past 4 years, angels here on earth with the grateful assistance of Heartland Hospice the last week of her life. Mary brought much joy into all our lives and she will be sorely missed. Remembrances can be made to Willow Lane Assisted Living 850 W. Elsner Ln. Appleton, WI 54913, the Alzheimer's Assoc., or to a charity helping "the least of these" at this challenging time of Covid-19. In light of current Covid concerns a celebration of life service will be held next summer in Minneapolis. To sign the guest book, please visit oconnellfh.com.
