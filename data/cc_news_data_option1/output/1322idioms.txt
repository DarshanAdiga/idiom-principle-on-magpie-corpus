Fort Lauderdale, United States, (APP - UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 3rd Apr, 2020 ) :Passengers from a virus-hit cruise ship and its sister vessel, also struck with a handful of cases, started heading home Friday from Florida, after being stranded at sea for days.
 The Zaandam, operated by Holland America Line, began its stranger-than-fiction journey on March 7 in Buenos Aires \-- before international restrictions to curb the spread of the coronavirus were in full force.
 It was meant to dock two weeks later in Chile, but when passengers aboard fell ill, several countries refused to let the ship dock.
 The Rotterdam came to its aid at sea, and the two vessels finally docked at Port Everglades in Fort Lauderdale on Thursday -- with dozens of sick people aboard, and four dead.
 "We have made history," said the captain of the Rotterdam, Bas Van Dreumel, in a message sent to AFP by a passenger.
 "Some of you have a long journey ahead, some of you have already arrived home here in Florida. (...) You made me a better captain and you made me a better man." On Friday, buses escorted by local police will transport those passengers deemed fit to travel to airports, where they will transfer to charter flights -- without transiting the terminal.
 "Walking down the hallway," passenger Wendy De Pinho told AFP in a video message as she and husband Rick -- both in masks -- left their cabin for the first time in two weeks.

On March 12, the Canton High boys hockey team laced up the skates at Canton Ice House for one of their final practices before the Division 2 state championship game. The Bulldogs, losers of just a single game over the last two seasons, had revenge on their minds.
 Canton was just a few days away from a highly anticipated TD Garden date with Lincoln-Sudbury, the lone team to outduel the Bulldogs in an astonishing 51 combined games over the 2018-19 and 2019-20 seasons.
 Canton's talented group of seniors never took the ice again.
 At the tail end of practice that Thursday evening, Canton athletic director Danny Erickson got together with boys coach Brian Shuman and girls hockey coach Dennis Aldrich to deliver the bad news -- amid the worsening coronavirus pandemic, the MIAA was canceling the rest of the winter sports season and declaring all state finalists in both hockey (the Canton girls were in their Div. 2 state championship game, too) and basketball to be co-champs of their respective divisions.
 The boys players could see Erickson talking to Shuman and they knew what was happening by the sad look on their coach's face.
 Shuman broke the news to the team after what he called their most "competitive practice of the year" getting ready for the Warriors.
 "I've talked to teams after losing in overtime in the playoffs, I've talked to teams after some heartbreaking losses of people in the community," said Shuman. "This is like nothing I've ever had to do before. And they took it as expected. They took it very, very hard."
 More than 10 days after getting the news, the Canton players were still devastated that they did not get a chance at revenge. Senior captain Tommy Ghostlaw was hurt the first time the Bulldogs played Lincoln-Sudbury -- a 6-4 L-S win at the Ice House on Feb. 12 that snapped Canton's 43-game unbeaten streak (40-0-3) -- and desperately wanted to make a difference in the rematch.
 "Just watching it all unfold, it stung to watch, but we were hoping" we would see them again, said Ghostlaw. "Some guys in the (handshake) line were saying, 'We'll see you later, we'll see you later,' like at the Garden. And it all came true. Our whole team was so hyped up to play them. We were ready to go. Obviously, it didn't work out with all this stuff going on. But we really wanted that game and we were hoping to see them back at the Garden."
 "Everyone was just shocked and couldn't breathe," senior Chris Lavoie, the team's leading goal scorer, said of his reaction to the state final being scrapped. "We didn't think it was real. It was crazy."
 "I think obviously everyone was devastated when they told us we couldn't play," senior captain Timmy Kelleher said. "Obviously, we were sad because the season ended, but (it also stung) not being able to prove that we were the best team again, prove it further in that game."
 Despite the disappointment for several of the Bulldogs players, they agreed that the decision was the right one to make.
 "I think at the end of the day, you know, people's safety is a priority in everything," said Kelleher. "But I think just every game you've got to play like it is your last. Because every game could really be (your last)."
 "One of the things a coach says, I guess, is control what you can control," senior defenseman Owen Lehane noted. "And we really can't control the spread of the virus going around right now. We could just control how we played, how we prepared for the game."
 In the future, Shuman hopes that his team will be able to look past this and remember the memories they did share. This year, the 2010 state championship team had a reunion party. He said the party was all about the memories they had during the season, the practices, the locker room, the team dinners, rather than the final game against Newburyport.
 He said his current group of devastated players will soon come to the realization that the memories are what high school sports are all about. Ghostlaw is already getting a sense of what Shuman hopes all of his players will feel in the future.
 "Just (realizing) that not everything can go your way sometimes," Ghostlaw said about what he learned from the game being canceled. "Even though bad things happen, you just have to realize that, looking back in the past couple years, playing hockey with these guys has been the best time of my life. It's not all about playing, it is about team dinners, spending time with your friends and just having an absolute blast being with them every day."
 Weeks later, the cancellation of the state final remains a tough pill to swallow for Canton. Even Shuman acknowledged that it is tough to miss out on the normal closure -- either the acceptance of a tough loss, or the joy of celebrating on the Garden ice as champions.
 "When you put that much intensity and that much emotion and that much passion into an entire season," said Shuman, "to have it end abruptly without really any control at all is difficult. It really is."

Lantana crafts of the tribal people of Singapathy, near Kovai Kutralam, is a new attraction at the Poompuhar’s ‘Crafts of Tamilnadu’ annual exhibition at its main showroom in Coimbatore.
 With a view to encourage the tribal people in crafts to eke out a living, the Handicrafts Development Corporation in association with the government is encouraging the tribal artisans to make furniture and other craft materials near Singapathy, said R. Narendra Bose, manager of showroom. Lantana, a weed shrub that invaded from Central and South America is a grave threat to the native flora in the reserve forest. The rapidly growing weed is considered to be a threat to biodiversity.
 The bamboo-like weed grows very fast, covers open ground very quickly and hinders the regeneration of species. It often outgrows other species, which leads to reduction in biodiversity.
 Besides Coimbatore, these types of weed shrubs are found abundantly in the forests at Chennapatna in Karnataka.
 Based on a tip-off given by the trainee IAS officer Sharanya Ari, the Tamil Nadu Handicrafts Development Corporation Limited took interest in introduction of furniture made using Lantana species (bamboo like) by the trained tribal artisans and were on display for sale at the exhibition for the first time.
 “It helps local artisans to create wealth from waste,” Mr. Bose said.
 Sofa sets, corner stand, tea table etc costs much lower than those made of bamboo and other types of woods, he added.
 Aadhi Yogi statue made of coconut shells by artisans and paper crafts made by the inmates of the Residential Industrial Training Centre for Mentally- Challenged Persons at Iruttupallam in Coimbatore are also an attraction at the expo.
 More than 150 products are on display for sale at the exhibition. Poompuhar expects the sale during the exhibition period to cross Rs. 5 lakh.
 The exhibition will be held between 10 a.m. and 8 p.m. on all days up to December 16, he said.

China also doesn’t say how many tests it has conducted, and doubts have been raised about whether it has tested extensively in Xinjiang, the province where it holds hundreds of thousands of Muslims in indoctrination camps.
 Few countries have done aggressive testing. And of course, the more testing there is, the more cases are found.
 Japan, with relatively few confirmed cases, has conducted only about 500 tests for every million people, raising fears that the virus might be spreading undetected. Similar concerns have been aired in Britain, whose testing rate — more than 2,400 people per million so far — is low by Western European standards, and includes relatively few health workers.
 In contrast, South Korea has tested more than 8,000 people per million, and Norway about 17,000.
 In the United States, state and local authorities collect figures from public and private labs, but they can be like apples and oranges: some labs report the number of tests conducted, some report how many people were tested, and some report only positive test results.
 The Covid Tracking Project, run by The Atlantic, has tried to compile all the U.S. numbers and reports more than 1.2 million tests so far, more than 3,600 per million people.

US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on Tuesday said he does not enjoy dealing with Pakistan as America’s relationship with the South Asian country has “drifted over the years”, noting that the two countries need to restore the ties to “one of common interest.”
 “Dealing with Pakistan — I don’t enjoy that,” Mr. Tillerson said in response to a specific query during a town hall with the State Department employees here.
 His remark, without any further explanation, was in response to a question posed by a State Department employee who asked: “Is it fair to ask and say do you enjoy your job as Secretary of State?”
 “...Pakistan is still an important and valued partner of the United States. Over the last decade, the relationship has drifted, and we’ve got to bring this relationship back to one of common interest,” Mr. Tillerson said.
 Today that’s just not the case, he told his State Department colleagues.
 “So we’re engaged in very frank discussions with Pakistan over the concerns we have about their own stability and their future, and the threat they’re under by allowing terrorist organisations to operate in their territory,” Mr. Tillerson said.
 The top US diplomat said the two countries should find ways as to how they could work together to bring stability and peace to the whole region.
 “We’ve got a great team working in that region as well. A lot of work left to do,” Mr. Tillerson said.
 Earlier in his remarks, Tillerson referred to the new South Asia Policy as one of the key foreign policy highlights in the first year of the Trump administration.
 Mr. Tillerson said that President Donald Trump took a very bold decision by asserting that the US will be in Afghanistan with its military presence and continue to fight terrorism and the Taliban on a conditions-based effort.
 He, however, refused to give any time limit for the withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan.
 “We’re there until this thing is brought to a conclusion. It’s not a blank cheque. It’s not forever. But we’re going to stay on the ground and support the Afghan Government,” he said.
 “The Afghan government has to continue to deliver on the needed reforms and create the conditions to have an inclusive government that allows for participation of all the ethnic groups in Afghanistan, including the Taliban.
 “When the Taliban are ready to come to that negotiating table, there will be a place for them to participate in a future Afghan government,” Mr. Tillerson said.
 According to him, Mr. Trump’s South Asia policy aims to deny any safe haven to terrorist organisations in the Afghanistan- Pakistan region.
 “Our policy is to deny them the ability to have a safe haven where they can organise, recruit fighters, raise money; plan and carry out attacks against our allies, our own homeland, as they did in the past. So the entire policy in South Asia is to achieve that,” Mr. Tillerson said.
 The top American diplomat asserted that the policy could be achieved by “eliminating the safe havens“; bringing on board the groups fighting with each other, to get them involved in dialogues and creating the conditions for a reconciliation process within Afghanistan for peace.

Pollux and Castor are two fairly bright stars not far apart on the face of the night sky, prominent on April evenings. These two are considered the "heads" in the constellation, Gemini the Twins.      They're not exactly identical twins.      Despite the bright moonlight this week, they stand out, high in the southern sky between 8 and 9 p.m. (daylight savings time) They are visible most of the night, setting in the northwest a little after 3 a.m.      Orion, the majestic constellation with its famed trio of stars marking Orion's Belt, can be used to point right at Pollux and Castor. Orion is a bit lower, in the south-southwest around 8-9 p.m. Trace an imagined line from Orion's bright blue-white star Rigel at lower right of the "Belt," through the bright red star Betelgeuse at upper left of the "Belt." Continue this line to the upper left, to the Castor and Pollux duo.      (Betelgeuse, by the way, has triumphantly regained its brightness after a few months of unusual dimness this winter.)      Pollux is the brightest of the two "heads" of the Twins, and the lower one (assuming you aren't in the Southern Hemisphere where the perspective is turned on its head). The star's color is light yellow-orange. In 2006, a planet about 2.3 times the mass of Jupiter, was discovered circling the star. The International Astronomical Union has named this planet Thestias.      Castor is bluish-white and bright, but less so than Pollux. Castor's claim to fame for amateur astronomers training their backyard telescopes at the sky is that there are actually six stars in the Castor system. We see it as one, with unaided eyes. There are three pairs of binary (double) stars, orbiting around a common center of mass.      Telescopes, however, only pick up three of these stars. Two are easily seen in a small telescope; you may also find a third star, which is a lot fainter. Each of them are double stars themselves, but they are so close it takes a spectroscope, splitting the starlight into their spectrum of colors, to resolve them as double stars. They don't know anything about social distancing, a serious matter here on planet Earth lately.      The rest of the naked-eye stars making up the pattern of Gemini the Twins stretch back to the west (or right as seen on an April evening), towards Orion. There is a beautiful star cluster known as M35 located near the stars marking one of the "feet" of the Twins. M35 is easily visible in binoculars when the moon isn't around, and is a fine sight in a small telescope.      It's interesting to note that Pollux is 34 light-years from the Earth, and Castor is 51 light-years away. That means the two "heads" of Gemini the Twins are 17 light-years apart. It takes that many years for the starlight from one to reach the other. That would seem to make the Twins an incredibly immense couple of brothers.      Of course, we know that the constellations are imagined, two-dimensional patterns of our making. The stars across the sky are in three dimensions, at greatly varying distances. A space traveler heading out among the stars would observe that the constellation patterns as we know them become unrecognizable the farther we travel from the sun.      That doesn't stop us from enjoying them!      Full moon is on Tuesday, April 7. The moon will be close to its monthly perigee, when it is closest to Earth. This will make the moon appear a little larger (by 14%) and brighter (by 30%) than when the full phase happens to occur close to the moon's farthest point, apogee.      Be sure to see the trio of planets in the southeast in the hour before dawn. From left are Mars, (which is reddish), Saturn and Jupiter (which appears as the brightest). Venus is extremely bright in the evening, in the western sky.   Keep looking up at the sky!      Peter Becker is managing editor at The News Eagle in Hawley, Pennsylvania.

It didn't take long for Matt Maguire's teammates on the Abington High boys basketball team to realize what he was capable of.
 It wasn't a matter of if he would reach his potential, it was a matter of when.
 "He doesn't play basketball as a sophomore," said Bryson Andrews of Maguire during the Green Wave's run to the Division 4 state final. "He plays basketball as a senior. He has some confidence. He's a great player and I can't wait to see what he does in two years."
 Maguire will enter his senior with 949 career points, threatening Andrews' program-leading mark of 1,359.
 Matt's older brother Jack made a prediction two years ago that no longer seems bold.
 "In four years he'll be up on the 1,000-point scorer list," declared Jack two years ago.
 And even after averaging 21.4 points and 11 rebounds per game in the tournament while leading the Green Wave to their first state title, there's still a higher ceiling for him.
 "As good as he is, in every area of his game he hasn't reached his potential and there's room to grow," said Abington coach Peter Serino.
 The guard brings rare height (6-5) and shooting to the floor. Maguire drained seven 3-pointers in the Div. 4 South semfinal win over Nantucket. That shooting performance came after air-balling his first attempt of the night.
 "Shooters shoot, shooter's mentality, that's all I've got to do," said Maguire after that performance.
 As a sophomore, Maguire averaged 14.3 points per game and earned Enterprise All-Scholastic honors. It didn't take him long into his junior year to show he was going reach another level.
 He scored 20 points in the season opener, a 76-41 win over Blue Hills. He followed that up with a career-high 41 points in a 93-73 win over Mashpee. Maguire needed only 26 field goal attempts (he made 14 of them) and made 10 free throws.
 "The question this year was how long it would take him to adapt to being that guy who is getting all the attention," said Serino. "He's going to be face guarded, he's going to get a second defender at him. Pretty quickly he showed he was ready for that."
 Shooting and scoring isn't all that Maguire brings to the table. Although he spends most of his time off the ball, Maguire is a solid passer. During last year's Div. 4 state semifinal win against Pope John Paul XXIII, it was Maguire dishing the ball off to Will Klein before Klein's heroic 3-point winner with 1.5 seconds remaining.
 "Matt gets a lot of attention for his shooting and his scoring but he is an outstanding passer," said Serino. "He sees the court very well and he understands the game on that end of the floor at a very high level. I don't think he gets enough credit.
 "That (pass to Klein) shows the level of maturity he has as a basketball player and as a teammate."
 With the graduation of 6-8 center Cam Curney, Maguire's role next season will likely grow to patrolling the paint more on defense.
 "Matt's role is just going to expand, which is hard to say," said Serino. "He's a kid who plays pretty much every minute and takes a lot of shots and gets a lot of rebounds but every phase of his game is going to have to take the next step."
