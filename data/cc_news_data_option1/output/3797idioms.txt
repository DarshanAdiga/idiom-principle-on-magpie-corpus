According to Kathleen Spencer, executive director and co-founder of CLO, The Threepenny Opera is a timeless and timely satire that remains stingingly relevant to our time. "2020 has been an awakening and dismantling of the confines and structures on which our society was founded. Brecht and Weill's seminal 1928 critique of capitalism suits these troubled times. In light of the COVID-19 pandemic and presidential election, we hope this production of The Threepenny Opera provides audiences an opportunity to reflect on the use and abuse of power."

On Sept. 18, Gov. Gavin Newsom signed AB 2152 into law, aiming to close this heart-rending loophole. "Bella's Act," by Assemblyman Todd Gloria, D-San Diego, will prohibit pet stores from selling dogs, cats or rabbits, period. Animals will still be available in pet stores — but only if they come from public shelters and bona fide rescue groups that do not deal with breeders. Bella's Act caps adoption fees at $500 and prohibits pet stores from receiving fees for allowing animals to be displayed — which proponents hope quashes the puppy-profit motive once and for all.

The move to phase out Native-themed mascots is “long overdue,” according to a panel of Native education leaders who spoke to the Washington State Board of Education late last week.
 The Washington State Board of Education twice has passed non-binding resolutions urging schools to discontinue the use of Native American mascots. Some schools have since made changes.
 By contrast, the Oregon Board of Education since 2015 has had the authority to mandate that public schools drop Native American mascots unless they got their local tribes’ approval and incorporated more tribal history in their curriculums. Some of the 16 affected Oregon districts changed their nicknames and others reached agreements with nearby tribal governments.
 At the college level, the NCAA made member schools drop such mascots more than a decade ago.
 In recent weeks, several southwest Washington school boards have taken action to change problematic mascots.
