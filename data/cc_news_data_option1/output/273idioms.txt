BOSTON-- A Suffolk County jury will have to decide whether to believe evidence from state prosecutors who say two men and a woman were running a large-scale commercial sex ring in Quincy and elsewhere, or their defense attorneys who described two men in an unwitting love triangle with a poor woman who was getting by on cash made giving massages that included sex acts while weighing a verdict for the trio.
 The lawyers made their closing arguments Tuesday in a human sex trafficking case against Pingxia Fan and Simon Shimao Lin, both of Boston, and Timothy Hayes, of Gloucester. Fan and Hayes face several counts of sex trafficking, money laundering, deriving support from prostitution and keeping a house of prostitution. Lin faces charges of money laundering and sex trafficking stemming only from locations in Quincy.

 Fan and Lin sat silently through the court session, listening to the proceedings translated through interpreters, while Hayes was more boisterous, commenting incredulously though closings to his attorney.
 Prosecutors with the attorney general's office say that between January and May 2017, the three ran a sex trafficking operation in two apartments in Quincy and one each in North Reading, Cambridge and Boston's Chinatown. Fan and Hayes are accused of recruiting and transporting Chinese women from other states, harboring them in the apartments to offer sexual services for cash and enticing customers with advertisements online. Transporting and harboring people for commercial sexual activity are included in the state's legal definition of trafficking a person for sexual servitude.
 "This business would have kept growing if not for the State Police and the FBI," Assistant Attorney General Nancy Rothstein said in her closing arguments.
 Rothstein estimated that the alleged commercial sex ring raked in hundreds of thousands of dollars before it was shut down in a sting in May, 2017, where local, state and federal law enforcement raided the five locations and arrested the three following a months-long investigation. Two Quincy locations, a house at 1 North Central Ave. and an apartment in the Avalon Quincy building on Quarry Street, were involved in the operation, according to prosecutors.
 Rothstein said that the three funneled thousands of dollars to a man in Connecticut to place ads for sex acts, some explicit while other were thinly veiled, on the now shuttered website Backpages.com. The site was known to advertise illicit goods and services. The rates were advertised as $130 for a 30 minute massage with a woman or $160 for an hour, but customers testified that implicit in the advertisements was that sex acts were also available in exchange for cash.
 Rothstein said evidence showed that Fan's phone was linked to the ads.
 Rothstein said that more than ten other women were involved in sex acts at the five locations and earlier in the trial described a miserable life for the women, who she said worked day and night, seven days a week, and almost never went outside the apartments. She said that the locations had hundreds of condoms and sexual lube, and that video surveillance showed the three bringing large packages of bottled water and paper towels to the locations to support the commercial sex business. She said the three took out trash at the apartments, later collected by police as evidence, that contained many used condoms and other trappings of a sex ring.
 "It is beyond clear that commercial sexual activity was going on at these locations," Rothstein said, imploring the jury to find each of the defendants guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.
 But defense attorneys for the trio called the state's case weak.
 Lin's lawyer, Charles Jordan, described him as a contractor in love with Fan who helped her with the Quincy apartments and said the state was trying to make the act of bringing water and paper towels to a Quincy apartment into a case of harboring women for commercial sex. Jordan said that his 10 minute closing argument was longer than the time prosecutors spent discussing evidence against his client at trial Jordan added that his client wasn't even in Quincy for much of the time the state outlined in the charges.
 Hayes' lawyer, Edward Wayland, said his client was also in love with Fan and that the pair has a romantic relationship. Blinded by love and trying to win Fan's heart over other men, Wayland said, Hayes would help Fan with money and signing leases to the apartments.
 "He was not running the show," Wayland said. "He would do anything she would ask him to."
 Wayland brushed away massage ledgers and cash found in a coat at his client's apartment as possibly belonging to Fan, and said Jayes could not speak Mandarin and couldn't even communicate with any of the other women involved, besides Fan.
 Fan's defense attorney, Brett Levy and Wayland both pointed out that the state chose not to persecute the men who purchased the sex acts, nor the women involved, and said the case should be one of prostitution, not sex trafficking.
 "Those gentlemen as we speak are at work or in bed with someone else thanks to your State Police," Wayland said.
 Levy said that none of the women were held against their will or coerced, though Rothstein pointed out in court that consent is not an element involved in the crime of sex trafficking.
 Levy said his client, abused and sterilized in China, came to the U.S. and turned to prostitution to make a living.
 "The this she did was massages and sex for a fee, and she isn't charged with that ... she should only be charged with prostitution," Levy said. "You cannot convict her of this crime."

 “Consider where we are now as a nation.

We would not have had the opportunity to serve in those positions without the sacrifices and the vision of Dr. King,” Holder said.

 “Today is a day that gives us the opportunity to reflect on his (Dr. MLK Jr.’s) example of grace and it is a timely and also a timeless reminder, as our civil society seems more under pressure today than it ever has with the siren call of social media and rough public discourse demanding us daily to be outraged with one another… MLK’s leadership reminds us that it requires grace to recognize our common humanity and to love each other even without perfect understanding,” Bruce said.

Perhaps the only thing more asinine than a handgun ban to combat violent street crimes is to put it in the hands of municipalities to design their own controls.
 If Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and the federal Liberals insist on such a path, as they have done since the election and have continued to discuss at the Liberal cabinet retreat in Winnipeg this week, then just outright ban them across the country.
 You will get complaints from coast-to-coast from responsible gun owners on either having to give up their guns or deal with even more strict controls in relation to just owning them -- almost all of which are for recreation or sport -- but at least you'd have consistency.
 The problem is, this government does not want to deal with complaints over controversial issues. They will deal with controversial issues, but often by kicking the responsibility and implementation on down the road to lower levels of government without proper funding.
 Case in point, the legalization of cannabis. I have little issue with the concept of legalizing cannabis for sale and production in this country as long as there are proper controls put in place. You want a new source of tax revenue to deal with your $20 billion deficits? Here is one potential new source. Rather that than the carbon tax.
 The problem came with implementation.
 The feds kicked it down to the provinces but left it open to how they wanted to deal with it. Some provinces, like Manitoba, had a degree of sanity in how they implemented it. In other provinces, like Alberta, it was a gong show. Every municipality has their own by-laws and regulations in place on everything from public consumption to sales to production. For example, the city of Edmonton has different rules than St. Albert, Spruce Grove, Stony Plain and Parkland County. For those unaware, those are all municipalities within a 20-minute drive of Edmonton. Each had months of deliberation and canvassing and debate in council. This scene played out across Alberta. It was a waste of time and is still rife with confusion.
 But the federal Liberals could stake claim to legalizing pot while putting all the heavy lifting on everyone else.
 When it comes to something as potentially dangerous as handguns, this is something you need a consensus on across the board.
 It is certainly not a decision that Winnipeg Mayor Brian Bowman wants to have to make.
 "Leaving it for municipalities, my concern is you will have silos, and, speaking as Winnipeg's mayor, we have a capital region where you wouldn't expect to get unanimity among the municipalities for a handgun ban," he said on Monday.
 We can dive further into the likelihood of the ineffectiveness of any handgun ban. The vast majority of gun violence in this country is not committed with legally purchased guns. They are smuggled in across the border, zip guns are created in underground factories, and they are bought and sold illegally.
 On Jan. 13, Winnipeg Police Service Public Information Officer Cst. Rob Carver said almost 100% of the handguns police seize following a crime are illegally obtained. A ban would not improve public safety.
 The Liberals are looking at other strategies to combat gun violence, including improving recreation options and facilities, to help keep kids off the streets and out of gangs, and beefing up border operations and penalties. I'm all for this. Many of these programs have suffered through years of neglect.
 Further banning handguns, however, and leaving it up to the municipalities to figure out? This is an appeal to a base that does not fully understand the issues, but can rally around a concept.
 "I guess it might make people feel good but it will not change the threat level one iota," said Carver.
 But that is what this government has been about since they came into power on these types of issues.
 Put on a good show without having to deal with the fallout.
