Quarterback Cam Newton waited 86 days to find his future team, but eventually landed with the New England Patriots, who were in need of a new star quarterback. While many questioned whether SuperCam would deliver following injuries and time off and wondered if he would gel with the offense, Newton has proved he's still got it. The Patriots started the 2020 season strong, going 2-1, and while evaluating Newton's performance, it's hard not to also notice his relationship with his team on and off the field.


  Since arriving in Foxboro, he has created a quick bond with members of the team, a bond that includes some pretty unique nicknames.


  These nicknames include, but are not limited to, "Highway 11," "Doughboy," "Dirty Dave," "Smokin' Joe," "Winnie the Pooh," "Free Mason," "Buzzo," "Burky," "Twin No. 1," "Twin No. 2," "Bo Diddly," "Crazy Legs," "Bent Dog," "Stiddy," "The Hoyster" and "Mickey Ds."


  During his press conference, the always dressed up QB1 refers to his teammates using these code names, sometimes making it hard to keep up with who he's talking about.

So far, 16 states with a total of 196 electoral votes at their disposal are on board. But the organizers have said they will not commit to it until they get enough states to equal 270 electoral votes. Such a plan would likely face legal challenges if enacted.

HUDSON - Town health officials reported Monday no residents tested positive for the coronavirus last week.


  "From Monday, September 21 to Monday, September 28, 2020, the total number of residents who tested positive for COVID-19 in Hudson remained at 238," according to the Board of Health's weekly COVID-19 press release. "There were no additional cases reported to the Hudson Board of Health by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health."


  Nine residents tested positive for the virus the week of Sept. 14-20.


  There are currently three active coronavirus cases, health officials said in the weekly update.


  The Board of Health in early August had reported no active coronavirus cases since July 27. There was also a day in July when the town reported zero active cases, but someone tested positive the following day. Five residents then tested positive between Aug. 3 and Aug. 10.


  The town saw a modest spike in cases in August, with five residents testing positive between Aug. 10 and 17, ten more between Aug. 17 and 24 and another 10 between Aug. 24 and Aug. 31.


  Those numbers began to decline in early September with only one new positive case reported between Aug. 31 and Sept. 7 and another one between Sept. 7 and Sept. 14, according to data from the town's Board of Health.


  Residents in their 30s have the most recorded positive tests with 50, followed by those in their 40s with 45. Forty-four residents in their 50s have tested positive, along with 32 in their 60s, 30 in their 20s, 22 younger than 20, 11 in their 70s and four in their 80s, according to the Board of Health's weekly report.


  The cases are split evenly between men and women, with 119 men testing positive and 119 women contracting the virus.

Barrett knows this test well, because she applied it in a 2019 opinion she authored for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. _Acevedo v. Cook County Officers Electoral Board_ involved a Democratic primary ballot for Cook County sheriff in Illinois. County law required the candidate to obtain signatures equal 0.5 percent of the county’s qualified voters in order to get on the ballot. That meant the plaintiff, Edward Acevedo, had to collect 8,236 valid signatures. He failed, and sued, claiming the law violated his First and Fourteenth Amendment rights to freedom of association and equal protection. Acevedo pointed to the lower statewide requirement of only 5,000 signatures, arguing that the County’s higher threshold was unconstitutional.

Brendan Duffy clerked for Amy Coney Barrett on the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals last year. Now that she's President Trump's new Supreme Court pick, Duffy is leaping at the chance to speak about her traits.


  "I cannot imagine a better pick or a better future justice, both as a jurist and a person," he responded without a beat.


  Duffy says Barrett was "a joy to work with." The judge, she says, is "one of the most brilliant people that I've ever met, and one of the kindest." He added that she has "a heart of gold" and she would ask them what's going on in their lives.


  "She cared about us both inside and out of the office," he beamed.


  He recalled that she would invite her team over and cook for them, New Orleans style, and bring in baked goods on hectic days when she wanted to "pick them up."


  "It became a home for all of us," he remembered.


  Knowing her true colors, Duffy is pained to read the outrageous reports attacking Barrett's character. Critics have even stooped to the point where they are questioning how she can be a mother to her seven children if she's on the Court, and wondering what her angle was when she adopted two children from Haiti.


  "It's sad and frustrating," Duffy said. "Judge Barrett's qualities are unassailable...I wish that everyone got to know her."


  And the American people may get to know her during the confirmation hearings starting October 12. Although the Brett Kavanaugh hearings in 2018 were pretty rough, Duffy says he's "overly hopeful" about Barrett's interrogation, especially after senators start looking at her record.


  But the signs are showing that this round is going to get ugly too. Some Democratic senators are already refusing to meet with her and calling her an "illegitimate" candidate.


  "She has more fortitude and poise than just about any person I've ever met," Duffy said. "I think she will handle it with incredible grace and poise."

Challenges to state voting laws passed to facilitate access during a pandemic inescapably collide with the conservative touchstone of federalism.

Bloomberg Opinion) -- Inch by inch, since the start of the pandemic, the White House has sought to sabotage the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for the political benefit of President Donald Trump. To an alarming extent, it has succeeded. Once globally recognized as “the best science-based, data-driven agency in the world,” in the words of its current director, the CDC is now in danger of losing the public’s trust entirely.
 The most glaring problem has been communication. Against the best judgment of its own staffers, the agency has said that reopening schools is crucial even if doing so increases the spread of the coronavirus. It has failed to caution churches to suspend or limit the use of choirs, which have been associated with outbreaks. It has even discouraged testing asymptomatic people, against the advice of nearly all experts — though it eventually reversed itself under a barrage of criticism. In each case, the agency’s scientific staff were ignored or overruled under pressure from the White House or from Trump himself.
 At every step, in fact, the administration has made matters worse. Its political operatives have pushed the CDC to revise Covid-19 analyses in its respected Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Reports, and have brazenly bullied agency officials. In an email obtained by the New York Times, an HHS adviser accused Dr. Anne Schuchat, an esteemed deputy director, of working to “embarrass the president.” Trump publicly criticized CDC Director Robert Redfield for emphasizing to Congress the importance of wearing masks and acknowledging the reality that vaccines are unlikely to be widely available until next year.
 Redfield has failed to forcefully push back on these attacks. But he is not principally to blame for the CDC’s fall from grace. That responsibility rests squarely with Trump, who is showing how much harm a president can cause by forcing federal agencies to serve his own political purposes. Rather than allow the CDC to do its job of keeping Americans informed about Covid-19, he has prodded the agency to echo his false message that the crisis has passed, that it’s safe to go back to school, to work, to church, to political rallies — maskless and carefree.
 Clearly, new leadership is needed, mainly at the White House. If voters can get that job done in November, the good news is that it’s still possible to return the CDC to its former effectiveness. With a new director working for a president who is sensible enough not to meddle inappropriately, the agency could gather detailed data on Covid-19 from the states, maintain an up-to-date national dashboard on the outbreak, and allow its scientists to resume regular public briefings, thereby once again offering Americans a common and reliable source of information about the pandemic.
 Congress can help, too, in part by investigating why the CDC produced a faulty coronavirus test at the start of the pandemic. It should also pass legislation to protect the agency’s data-gathering efforts from outside interference — to avoid the kind of chaos that occurred last summer when HHS officials abruptly took over the collection of hospital data on Covid-19 (another move that had to be reversed). Finally, lawmakers should ensure that the CDC’s technical reports are insulated from political meddling, much as reports from the Labor Department, the Census Bureau and the National Center for Health Statistics are.
 Quite by accident, the Trump administration has taught the country a lesson about how much an effective CDC is needed. Ideally, the agency can be brought back to full strength in time to finally offer some federal leadership in a crisis that has been out of control for too long.

Common Cause_ last year), voting rights (which the Supreme Court hampered when it struck down a key provision of the Voting Rights Act in _Shelby County v. Holder_ in 2013), money in campaigns (which the Supreme Court ushered in en masse by lodging First Amendment rights in corporate speech in _Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission_), and ethics rules for government officials (which is badly needed after Trump’s serial firing of inspectors general, a post-Watergate legislative reform designed to foster neutral oversight of those in power). Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell blocked the bill in his chamber, but a new Democratic majority in the Senate would likely pass it, inviting inevitable conservative legal challenges.

He talked about how easy it was to convince himself it wasn't really a problem because the pill use felt "manageable." He knew if he started drinking or doing cocaine, he'd be out of control—he understood those to be unmanageable addictions. But the pain pills didn't keep him from doing his work or his dad duties or his normal daily life, so it was easy to keep using them.


  Then he explained how, after more injuries this year, his painkiller use got "shadier and shadier." He started buying pills instead of just using the ones he was prescribed. When he started lying to his loved ones and was high at his 16-year sobriety celebration earlier this month—which he called "the worst hour of my life"—he knew he was in trouble.


  So in recent weeks, Shepard came clean to Bell and Padman privately and gave them all of his remaining pills. He spoke to a friend he looks up to, who frankly told him that his biggest character flaw was arrogance, that he basically thought he was smart enough to outsmart addiction. He realized the only antidote to that was extreme humility.


  Shepard attended an AA meeting and shared the whole story with them as well. He said it was one of the most powerful experiences he's had ever had.


  _"So Tuesday really was day one. Yeah. And then, so I went to this meeting and I…man, I've known the men in this meeting for seventeen and a half years because I had many attempts before I got going. And I told my whole story and I told it honestly. And I went first and I was crying and it turned into the most incredible, like, 90 minutes I've ever experienced, where there was just so much love and there was so much understanding and kindness in unconditional love._


   _And it's the only—there's probably been many others—but it's the only experience I can remember having that was just grace, the definition of grace, and it was very emotional and it was a really, really surreal kind of experience._


   _And when it was over, I actually mentally, for the first time in a very long time, felt optimistic because for the last while, a long time, I've known intellectually that things are going to get worse, that each encounter with it has gotten more shady and more dangerous, and I recognize that the next go around would be, oh, I can't get pills, let's snort heroin. And, you know, and I've had a lot of friends that I've watched go through this whole cycle._


   _And I finally have the humility to say I will not be any different, I won't be special, I won't be smarter. I will be exactly like everyone else."_


  Then he decided to come clean publicly, despite a great deal of fear and embarrassment in doing so. He said he worried about how it affect opportunities for Kristen, how it might impact him financially due to companies that might not want to work with him now, how the bombardment of judgments about what he should have done or could have done might feel, how people who looked up to him for his sobriety might feel betrayed or misled.


  He ultimately decided that total and complete honesty was the only way to go. And of course, that authenticity is what his fellow recovering addicts really need to see.

(CNN) - From computing in a small space to working at a dining room table, working from home isn’t always easy on the body.Health and wellness expert Stephanie Mansour says common household items can be used to help ease the stress.“First, you’ll use a tennis ball up against the wall and massage the low back. Go right up and down along the sides of the spine, bend the knees and then stand up to get both sides of the spine,” she says. “Also, work the glutes because often times tight glutes can cause low back pain.”Next, you don’t need a Pilates ball to help your abs. A pillow will do the trick.“Place in between your inner thighs, squeeze the inner thighs with the pillow and pull the abs in,” Mansour says. “Repeat this 10 times.”And to do a yoga pose, you don’t need a mat, just a table.Mansour says one way to stretch your lower back and the backs of your legs is to bend at the waist and reach out to a tabletop, putting your body at a 90-degree angle.She says these are a few ways to stay loose when you’ve got those work-from-home body woes.Copyright 2020 CNN Newsource.

Bloomberg) -- Doctors and nurses at Kenya’s biggest publicly-funded hospital started a strike on Monday to push for better remuneration, paralyzing services at a time the nation is battling Covid-19.
 The workers want the government to implement a new organizational structure, including pay adjustments, agreed in 2012 when the Kenyatta National Hospital, or KNH, was upgraded to a top-tier parastatal, according to their union.
 The Salaries and Remuneration Commission, mandated to advise on pay of public officers, hasn’t approved a new pay deal, Chibanzi Mwachonda, secretary general of the Kenya Medical Practitioners, Pharmacists and Dentists Union, said by phone.
 The strike is the latest obstacle to Kenya’s fight against the coronavirus outbreak, currently with 38,115 confirmed infections and 691 deaths. Health- care workers earlier threatened nationwide protests next month over poor working conditions, including a lack of proper personal protective equipment. Several county-run health facilities already reduced their capacity because they haven’t received funding from the central government two months into the new financial year.
 The strike at KNH may continue until a new pay deal is approved, the Kenya National Union of Nurses secretary-general, Seth Panyako, said separately.
 KNH’s chief executive, Evans Kamuri, couldn’t immediately comment when called on Monday.

Leah DeYoung contributed nine kills in the win while Cassie Dolezal registered eight. Blinderman also came up with 16 digs on defense while Abigail Blaszczyk finished with 14.


  “Abigail Blaszczyk again was tremendous defensively flying all over the court for us,” Thiel said. “I continue to be impressed by her increased mental game that is letting her physical skills really show this season.”


  Blaszczyk recorded a team-high 24 digs two nights earlier against Osceola and DeYoung, Kylie Naylor and Dolezal all had double-digit kills with 18, 11 and 10, respectively, but the Tigers couldn’t get over the hump in a 16-25, 16-25, 28-26, 23-25 loss to the Chieftains.


  “We really struggled with finishing our attacks,” Thiel said. “Our outsides had a lot of opportunities to score down the line but just turned the ball a little too wide. Coupled with a lot of serving errors and we just weren't who we are in the first two sets of that match. We're really proud of what we did in the third and fourth sets of that match.”


  The Tigers will host St. Croix Central Tuesday night, Sept. 29, and visit Prescott Thursday, Oct. 1, before returning home to host Somerset Saturday, Oct. 3, at 10 a.m.


  # Wildcats adjusting well on the fly


  If there’s one certainty surrounding the Wildcat volleyball team this season, it’s that whoever they plug into the lineup is stepping up.


  The Wildcats posted a pair of 3-0 victories over Rice Lake last week, and both matches featured some new players in new positions.


  “We talked prior to the season that we needed to ‘be flexible, be positive and be ready,’” Wildcat coach Sara Kealy said. “This was in regards to whether or not we would have a season. We are three weeks in and it continues to be a phrase we reference. The schedule is constantly changing, the line up is constantly changing, but it doesn't matter. We are grateful for the opportunity to play volleyball. I had kids fill roles this week that they typically don't, and they continue to impress me. All of these athletes are so versatile and well rounded.”


  Dani Lien moved to outside hitter Thursday night after playing libero in the previous three matches while Maddy Doerre took her talents from the backcourt to the net following the shift of Amelia Armstrong to the middle blocker position, and Kealy said both Doerre and Armstrong are hitting the ball aggressively.


  “I can tell that Maddy is getting more and more comfortable because she is hitting a larger variety of sets,” Kealy noted. “It is nice to know that we have the depth to fill roles when players are out due to injury and illness.”


  Kealy said the Wildcats were missing one player Monday against Rice Lake and two players Thursday due to Covid testing.


  “We are grateful that both are negative and we can get back to our normal roster in practice this week,” she said. “But when players have to make these adjustments, it’s nice to have the teammates around them provide stability.”


  Covid has also caused the cancellation of a pair of scheduled matches against Menomonie this week. The Cats will make up one of those matches Tuesday, Oct. 6, at Menomonie and play Hudson in a home-and-home series Monday, Oct. 12 and Thursday, Oct. 15, before wrapping up the regular season at home against Menomonie Monday, Oct. 19.

FOXBOROUGH, Mass. (AP) — The Patriots thrived last season when their defense was finding ways to take the ball away from opponents.
 It did that against the Raiders in Sunday’s 36-20 win by forcing three turnovers, including one that was recovered in the end zone by Deatrich Wise Jr. for a touchdown. It also dominated on third down and in the red zone against a Las Vegas offense that was among the league’s most efficient in both categories.
 They’re all positive signs as New England (2-1) shifts its attention to a looming road matchup with defending champion Kansas City.
 “They’re a good team. A lot of people have them circled on their schedule as a big opponent from the beginning of the year,” cornerback Jonathan Jones said. “They kind of have that mentality of teams that, year after year, you know you’re going to have a tough game on your schedule.”
 New England’s defense had all kinds of problems trying to contain Seattle’s Russell Wilson in Week 2’s loss and will have just as big a challenge against Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes.
 Heading into Monday night’s matchup with Baltimore the reigning Super Bowl MVP had completed 65% of his passes for 513 yards, five TDs and no interceptions in Kansas City’s first two games.

Do you, like me, wake up mornings to the big, broad question, "How am I doing in this life I'm supposed to be living?"
   
 It might be better to just leap over the question, put on your clothes, drop some food in your stomach, and head out onto the moving sidewalk of your daily preoccupations or isolated endeavors.
   
 But it's difficult to head out wondering, with a certain spiritual leader, "What in hell is really going on?"
   
 So we scavenge The Sentinel, watch and listen to various levels of world reporting, then engage those who desperately try to discern and interpret from their vast experience what might be going on.
   
 But there are those monstrous road bumps that catapult our longings and complicate hopes that arise. So we're still wondering as we go, or don't go.
   
 How are we doing with all the inner-life-crushing facets of our present culture? How are we doing with the multiple persons invading our strivings with their answers? How are we doing with all the black-and-white reasonings and encapsulating "-isms" that bottle up our minds?
   
 How are we handling the constant bombardments of threats and disruptions to people just trying to be living beings? Or the incessant, flagrant reactions to reactions to reactions? Or that "winning" is what really matters? Or that I win is what REALLY matters? Or the influx of "alternative facts"? Or that it is no longer shameful to be a hypocrite?
   
 How fearful or unfearful are we about the U.S. Constitution becoming a pick- and-choose instrument? Or the Declaration of Independence being irrelevant to gaining political power?
   
 Or that "freedom" has so many personal interpretations that it can no longer be defined? Or that God is now a personal or corporate possession?
   
 Where is the humility and compassion we can trust to lead us? How is it that integrity has become a lost basis for living? How did stardom and personality cults gain so much control over people's minds?
   
 How did the stream of spiritual perception become so shallow? How did concern for everyone's well-being get so diluted? What do we feel for the 47 percent of persons who get no direct benefit from the stock market?
   
 What lies behind all the masks political personalities wear? (But please don't take off the facial masks; some folks are trying to survive here.) Or behind the seeming lack of alarm that 200,000 of our people have perished while alone and gasping for air?
   
 Oh, I do get happy or a heart-leap of joy at certain times! When I pick up The Sentinel and read of something wonderfully constructive or creative being done or experienced. Or read of earnest efforts to understand or confront or become sensitive to others. Or when taken captive by something of beauty or enduring value.
   
 Or when I become aware of those acting out their faith, or making wise choices for themselves or others, or engaging in what is just and freeing, or using power for others' good?
   
 Or when I come face to face with those who register vital living, speak positively, invoke kindness, search truthfully, show loving care, offer acceptance, listen openly, wonder vs. dogmatize -- even toss in some lightness and humor.
   
 But I will also heed the prophet: "Shun those who speak 'Peace! Peace!' When there is no Peace!"

I’m sorry you feel unloved in your marriage. From what you are saying, it sounds like there is a HUGE lack of communication going in your relationship. All relationships are built on honest and open communication, even if what is being said is difficult or hurts. After 25 years a marriage can become routine. Perhaps the two of you can start doing more together. Have you tried asking her on dates? Covid has made those options difficult, but not impossible. You can take turns cooking a new meal for one another once a week and enjoying it while sitting at the table listening to some music and getting to know one another again. Play games together, take walks together, go on long drives and site see. Ask difficult questions that maybe you do not want to know the answers too. Therapy can help if you are both open to it. I get the feeling maybe she doesn’t think you communicate that well either, perhaps she is giving so much attention to your son because she is feeling just as alone as you do. I am sensing this from the comment about them going on a family vacation and you not being invited. They are your family; you didn’t need an invite. You should have asked about the vacation and included yourself. Al, my friend, you need to start talking to your wife.

While tougher tests certainly will be coming, the Colts' defense may have a few more weeks to build momentum.
 Next up is a date at Chicago amid a quarterback change. Then Indy heads to Cleveland against turnover-prone Baker Mayfield. On Oct. 18, the Colts welcome rookie quarterback Joe Burrow and Cincinnati to town and, following a bye, they host Detroit.
 If the defense continues to be this productive, Indy could be in playoff mix before hosting Baltimore on Nov. 8. But it looked as if that could be the case last September, too, and Indy wound up losing seven of its last nine, missing the playoffs for the fourth time in five years.
 But this time, general manager Chris Ballard spent millions to upgrade the talent and depth of Indy's defense.
 “I think we have an excellent defense. I’ve felt this way from the start,” Reich said. “I’d like them to keep this up. Obviously, the standards are high, and the expectations are high. But it’s about playing good football, playing winning football whatever that takes."
 WHAT’S WORKING
 The short passing game. Philip Rivers leads the league in completion rate (78.3%) and with a passer rating of 99.9, he's on pace for his second highest since 2013. The reason: 39 of his 72 completions are to running backs or tight ends.
