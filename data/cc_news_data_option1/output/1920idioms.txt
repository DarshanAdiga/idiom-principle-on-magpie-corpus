As I mentioned before, Energy Transfer is a very complex firm structurally. The company has various responsibilities, like cash flows to and from noncontrolling interests and preferred distributions, that are technically listed under investing and financing activities. Even so, the nature of these items means that to be philosophically honest, they should be factored out of true free cash flow to get a real sense of free cash flow for the firm. By my estimate, annualizing the figures we have, we get about $2.1 billion in adjustments that should be factored out. This brings true free cash flow to $2.33 billion, for a deficit this year versus what planned growth capex is of $1.27 billion.
 Another way to look at the firm is by annualizing its DCF. This may be the better way. Annualizing it, we get $5.8 billion. Take out distributions of $3.3 billion to bring this down to $2.5 billion. The disparity here gives us a deficit of $1.10 billion. Both this reading and the one before it suggests the firm will either need to issue shares, take on debt, or come up with some other arrangement in order to cover its spending for the rest of this year. Even so, this is not all that bad when you consider that this growth capex will go on to create additional cash flows for the company in the long run.
 ## Takeaway
 Right now, the market is not too happy with the oil and gas industry. Certainly, there is a lot of pain in the space right now. Enough pain, in fact, that Energy Transfer has even had to revise down its forecasts for the current fiscal year. Despite this, investors should take solace in the fact that the company appears to be on really solid footing, and that if estimates are accurate, it and its distribution (which results in a yield today of 16.25%) make this a strong, long-term prospect to consider.

It's not often you consider the view through a window unless it's streaked.
   
 As Florida begins to reopen from the COVID-19 lockdown, the return of the window washer is a sign of a return to normalcy.
   
 One of the many industries hurt by the pandemic, window washers had little to wash because most businesses closed in early April.
   
 "We were down 70% ... Restaurants are our biggest clients. Even though they were doing take out, they weren't making enough money to justify having us come and clean the windows," said Raymond Force, owner of MJ's Window Cleaning.
   
 For Bill Roberts, his Classic Squeegee window cleaning business also dropped off.

 "It affected commercial and residential. Some of our commercial customers were not using our services because they were closed. Then there were others that canceled for the rest of the year because they were trying to save wherever they could," Roberts said.
   
 Residential clients dropped off due to social distancing concerns and stay-at- home orders.
   
 "The residential work is our bread and butter. Not too many people wanted us in their houses," Force said.
   
 Just before Gov. Ron DeSantis started reopening some businesses on May 4, things looked dire.

 Both Force and Roberts said they had no work the week before the reopenings. While both cut employee hours, neither laid off anyone.
   
 Since restaurants, nail salons, barbershops and retail stores started opening again, business is ramping up.
   
 "Some of the restaurants still aren't allowing vendors inside the business. Some are only wanting us to do the outside," Force said, noting that window washers clean both the inside and outside of the window.
   
 Residential customers are also coming back.
   
 "I think by June, we're going to start to feel normal again," Force said. "We've already seen our phone ring this week more than all of last week."

y. Taking the long axis depth of the space as the base of creation, a colorful device rhythm is drawn in the rhythm of the rhyme. For example, if the living room enters and exits the wooden façade to bring out the movement of the keys, the porch will show the temperament of the melody with the suspended stacking device. The blue light effect of the restaurant is like a lazy and uninterrupted jazz atmosphere, and the top of the room is in black and white. The color of the piano color is spread. After the transition into the private sector, the strong exotic breakout shocked, and the strong Nanyang sentiment lingered in the tent grille. The natural and unrestrained wood and muddy water were all over the wall of the heavens and earth, completely replicating the travel tones into the home. To satisfy the freedom and calmness that must be met in the space.

Together they owned several successful businesses including Nan's Blossom Shop, Aggieland Flowers, University Flowers and several other business ventures. Additionally, Louie loved the cattle business and could often be found on his land around Calvert and Franklin caring for his herd.
