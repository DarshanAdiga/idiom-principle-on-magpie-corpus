U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to disclose details of his long- delayed Middle East peace proposal to Israeli leaders on Monday, as he attempts to generate some momentum towards resolving one of the world's most intractable problems.
 Mr. Trump will hold separate, back-to-back meetings with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Benny Gantz, the head of the centrist Blue and White Party, who is Netanyahu's rival in March 2 elections.
 On Tuesday, Mr. Trump will deliver joint remarks with Mr. Netanyahu at the White House, where the president may reveal details of his peace proposal.
 The two days of foreign policy meetings will provide Mr. Trump with a contrast from the trial in the Republican-led Senate that is weighing articles of impeachment against him approved by the Democratic-led House of Representatives.
 But whether it truly will jumpstart the long-stalled effort to bring Israelis and Palestinians together is far from certain.
 Palestinians have refused to engage the Trump administration on the effort and roundly denounced a $50-billion economic revival plan it set forth last July to lift the Palestinian and neighboring Arab state economies.
 Palestinians fear the plan will dash their hopes for an independent state in the West Bank, east Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip.
 The White House hope was that if Mr. Trump could get the support of both Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Gantz for the plan, it would help provide some momentum. A U.S. official said Mr. Trump wants to know both Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Gantz are on board with the plan before announcing it.
 Trumps message to both: “You have six weeks to get this [plan] going, if you want it,” the official said.
 Having both leaders present helps take the politics out of the effort, said a U.S. source familiar with internal deliberations.
 “The rationale...is it depoliticizes this to the point that, no matter what happens on March 2, the two leaders of the two largest parties can potentially be supportive,” the source said.
 The Trump plan is the product of three years' effort by senior advisers Jared Kushner and Avi Berkowitz, as well as Jason Greenblatt, who left the government last autumn.
 Mr. Trump last year had hoped to release his secret proposal aimed at triggering negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians, but was forced to delay it as Mr. Netanyahu struggled to form a governing coalition.
 The proposal, more than 50 pages long, aims to take on some of the most difficult issues separating the two, such as the status of Jerusalem. Palestinians want the citys eastern part as their future capital.
 Mr. Trump, talking to reporters on Air Force One on Thursday, said he was eager to release his plan.
 “They say that's the hardest of all deals. I love doing deals,” he said.
 Mr. Netanyahu, a veteran right-wing leader, faces political and legal troubles at home as he heads for his third election in less than a year, and was indicted on criminal charges in November. He denies any wrongdoing.
 Mr. Netanyahu's principal domestic political rival, Mr. Gantz, a centrist former general, last week lifted his objection to having the peace plan published before Israel's March election. He had previously seen it as interference in the vote.
 “I am looking forward to meeting the president - a president of utmost friendliness to the State of Israel - on a matter that is very important for the State of Israel - with national, strategic and security ramifications,” Mr. Gantz told reporters as he landed in Washington on Sunday.
 “We will hold a back-and-forth, get to know one another, and take it from there.”
 But Mr. Trump, preoccupied with November's re-election bid, faces his own political clock, and can ill afford to wait months for Israel to decide its next prime minister, a U.S. official said.

It allowed the second fewest deep completions in the regular season, with only eight on 48 attempts, thanks in large part to Sherman's coverage skills and Ward's ability as a free safety to cover ground deep downfield.
 “We believe in each other,” Sherman said. “We believe in the scheme. We believe in what we've done all year, and we plan on going out there and putting a good product on tape and seeing how it goes.”
 When San Francisco has struggled defensively this season it has often come against more mobile quarterbacks, with Kyler Murray, Russell Wilson and Lamar Jackson all having more success than QBs less apt to run like Aaron Rodgers and Kirk Cousins.
 That's just another reason why Mahomes is so tough. He has scrambled 10 times this postseason for 112 yards, taking advantage of undisciplined rush lanes and defensive backs who drop too deep into coverage.
 The quarterback who exploited that the most against the Niners this season was Wilson, who scrambled 12 times for 79 yards in two games, compared with just 20 scrambles for 82 yards against San Francisco in the other 16 games.
 "Every week, whether you're playing a guy like Mahomes or a statue, it doesn't matter," Saleh said. “You have to have respect for where he is in the pocket. And your pass rush has to tie in with one another so that way you're just not carelessly rushing the passer to where even a statue can buy time and escape the pocket and create an explosive play through an off-schedule play. But that goes every single week.”

“It’s almost humorous after they get over the shock of, ‘This is real,’” Sinn said. “There’s really no conversation about whether they want to move forward. It’s just kind of, ‘Well, can I get a refund?’”
 Zollinger said he now looks at the other rooftop solar projects on his street a little differently.
 “There are two other solar projects that got there first but because they can only reach a certain capacity we’re just pushing it past the line,” he said. “At the end of the day it’s really a bum deal for my wife and I who would love to do this.”
 He’s still planning to build a new barn, and there’s a chance he could revisit the idea of installing solar panels if a proposed commercial solar project nearby pays for the upgrades to the grid in the next few years.
 “It doesn’t blow up our world,” Zollinger said. “It just makes me frustrated. That is not how this should have went. At the end of the day it kind of feels like the big guy shoving us out of the room, and that’s what it is.”
 Eddy said the big question is who should be paying for the upgrades that are needed to allow for more renewables to feed into the grid.
 “The math doesn’t lie. These upgrades need to happen based on what has been installed in these areas,” Eddy said. “I was surprised that there was no regulation in place to make sure it wasn’t affecting average Oregonians and their ability to install solar.”
 Eddy said if the problem continues, he might have to downsize or move his Silverton-based business to another area. He said it seems like the state as a whole has been pushing for more solar and renewable energy, “but we haven’t figured out how to actually make the wires and the nuts and bolts work to do that.”
 Angela Crowley-Koch, executive director of the Oregon Solar Energy Industries Association, said grid capacity is a problem across the state — in both PacifiCorp and PGE territories.
 In some cases, the utilities should be making the upgrades themselves, she said, and most commercial solar projects do end up paying for the required upgrades.
 Meanwhile, she’s helped people send their complaints to the Oregon Public Utility Commission, which has the power to change the rules for who pays for what upgrades.
 “I think it’s still an open question,” Crowley-Koch said. “There’s a lot of folks not getting solar that want it because of this issue.”

"Kobe Bryant was far and away the greatest athlete I had the privilege of representing during my 35 years as a player agent. And I represented many great athletes. I've known Kobe since he was a 17-year-old senior at Lower Merion High on Philadelphia's Main Line. He had a fearsome intellectual curiosity and his enthusiasm was contagious. The glint in his eyes wasn't just joy: It was sparks from a fire that couldn't be tamped down. To him, anything less than the best was failure. He deeply loved his wife Vanessa and the family they created, Natalia, Gianna, Bianka and Capri. He cherished his daughters and they were always his top priority. Losing Gianna makes this even more tragic. Kobe's death is especially wrenching knowing what he was capable of, and what he might have accomplished in his post NBA life. He was already well on his way, continuing to have such an impactful life."-- Arn Tellem, Bryant's former agent and now the Detroit Pistons' vice chairman.

New Delhi intends to sell its entire stake in the debt-crippled national carrier Air India, the government announced Monday, after failing previously to secure any bids for a majority share.
 The airline, which owes more than $8 billion, has been struggling to pay salaries and buy fuel, with officials recently warning that it would have to shut down unless a buyer was found.
 On Monday the civil aviation ministry released a document inviting bids for a 100 percent stake, setting March 17 as the deadline for initial submissions.
 Potential buyers would have to assume around $3.26 billion in debt, the document said.
 The government was forced in 2018 to shelve plans to sell a 76 percent stake in Air India after failing to attract any bidders.
 India's Tata Group, Singapore Airlines (SIA) and IndiGo were all linked to a takeover but subsequently ruled themselves out.
 Founded in 1932 and formerly India's monopoly airline, the company was once known affectionately as the "Maharaja of the skies".
 But it has been haemorrhaging money for more than a decade and has lost market share to low-cost rivals in one of the world's fastest-growing but most competitive airline markets.
 In November aviation minister Hardeep Singh Puri had said the airline would "have to close down if it is not privatised".
 State-run oil companies halted fuel supplies to Air India in August after it fell behind on payments, though the firms agreed to lift the suspension a month later after talks brokered by the government.
 The country's aviation sector has been stuck in a slump since the collapse of Jet Airways last year.

For the 10-year period from 2009 to 2018 Albert Gallatin played 91 games, the Colonials went 9-82 and surrendered 3,624 points which is No. 2 in the WPIAL for that period.
 Connellsville played 95 games and had a record of 20-75. The Falcons gave up 3,631 points. That is No. 1 in the WPIAL for that period of time.
 Laurel Highlands played 99 games and had a record of 28-71. The Mustangs allowed 3,616 points which ranked third in the WPIAL.
 Brownsville played 94 games and was 10-84. The Falcons allowed 3,362 points. That ranked seventh in the WPIAL.
 Uniontown played 95 games and was 20-75. The Red Raiders gave up 3,504 points which ranks fourth in the WPIAL for that 10-year stretch.
 Geibel Catholic decided to abandon its football program after the 2013 season when it was forced to forfeit three games.
 Frazier was the only Fayette County high school with a winning record from 2009 to 2018. The Commodores posted a mark of 59-43. Frazier outscored opponents 2,475 to 1,972.
 None of the Fayette County schools made the WPIAL playoffs last season. Uniontown was 0-10 and the once formidable Red Raiders own the longest football losing streak in the WPIAL at 32 games. Connellsville was 2-9 last season, Brownsville was 2-8, Laurel Highlands was 2-8 and Frazier was 3-7.
 Albert Gallatin, which left the WPIAL for football and played an independent schedule last season, posted a record of 5-3. It was the Colonials’ first winning season since 1983.
 Uniontown’s last WPIAL playoff appearance was 2009, Laurel Highlands 2015, Connellsville 2014, Frazier 2017 and Brownsville 2000.
 The WPIAL presented two realignment proposals to member schools Jan. 8 and asked administrators to vote. More than 70 percent of responses favored Proposal 1, a plan that maintained six classifications divided by enrollment.
 Proposal 2, a more radical approach, would have divided WPIAL teams into 20 conferences by geography. Teams of different enrollment size would have shared the same conference, but a majority of schools rejected that idea.
 “A lot of people who voted for (Proposal) 2 said they didn’t mind (Proposal) 1,” WPIAL Associate Executive Director Amy Scheuneman said. “Proposal 1 was an improvement over previous cycles.”
 It wasn’t a surprise that Proposal 1 passed, but all the Fayette County schools voted for Proposal 2.
 Connellsville AD Richard Evans indicated the Falcons were in favor of Proposal 2.
 “Absolutely we voted in the survey to go with Proposal 2,” Roebuck said.
 “We went with Proposal 2,” Uniontown Administrative Athletic Director DJ Burns said.
 “We looked at both proposals,” Laurel Highlands head football coach Rich Kolesar said. “They both had a lot of positives. Both proposals we were able to play Connellsville and Uniontown. Proposal 1 it looks like we will probably get to play Brownsville, Proposal 2 we would have had the option to play Albert Gallatin and maybe having an open date in our schedule. So we really weren’t strongly in favor of one or the other, but we felt Proposal 2 was a little bit better for us.”
 So the section breakdown has Connellsville in 5-A Section 2 along with Franklin Regional, Gateway, Latrobe, Penn-Trafford and Woodland Hills. Uniontown and Laurel Highlands are assigned to 4-A Section 3 with Belle Vernon, McKeesport, Ringgold, Thomas Jefferson, Trinity and West Mifflin.
 Brownsville will be in Class 3-A Section 3 with Elizabeth Forward, Mount Pleasant, South Allegheny, Southmoreland, South Park and Yough. Frazier is assigned to Class 2-A Section 3 along with Beth-Center, Chartiers-Houston, Charleroi, McGuffey, Washington and Waynesburg Central.
 Let’s look at some problems that Fayette County schools face in football. Declining participation numbers top the list. It is not just a problem in Fayette County. Nationwide high school football numbers are down 10 percent.
 “We started with 59 players and ended up with 52 players,” Kolesar said. “That’s the most players since 2009 at LH. I think our coaching staff made a culture where the kids were having fun playing football. We tried to make it a little more enjoyable and we had a little more success than the previous year. This year in our first few weeks of workouts I’ve had 56 kids in the weight room.”
 Connellsville had 44 kids out for football.
 “We finished mid to high 20s numbers-wise,” Burns said. “Numbers have been a problem and it’s a combination of kids valuing other activities, kids working after school, media coverage of the dangers of playing football. We defiantly have some talented kids walking the halls that aren’t playing because they don’t want to get hurt for other sports and obviously parents wanting them to sit out because of the perceived danger of the sport. Also if you are not winning, kids don’t want to be part of a losing team.”
 “We ended up in the mid 20s,” Roebuck said. “Numbers have been a problem for many years. I just think it’s a snowball effect of not being very successful and trying to figure out how to ask kids to come bust their butt in the weight room and work hard when they haven’t seen any light at the end of the tunnel.”
 Adding to the numbers problem is the fear of concussions.
 “There’s still kids out there, yeah, we are in the 50s right now, but we could be in the 60s,” Kolesar said. “That perception of football being the cause of so many injuries ... there’s a lot of kids who would like to play, but they say my mom won’t let me. The story that’s come out on CTE and head trauma, we really don’t know yet. I got to listen to Merrill Hoge speak to coaches. They did a study of 100 players and a third had no associated head trauma with CTE. We don’t know yet. It’s just the unknown.”

What are we going to do with these resources? There is still coal in Enugu and all these fossil fuels will still exist in the future but will they be acceptable as a source of energy?

A basketball icon. Is dead tonight more not just by the sports world but by anyone who valued relentless drive. An achievement in. Kobe Bryant. The man who could score 81 points in a single day. An all star and NBA champion for the late. He was nicknamed the black mom put off the court he was a devoted father flew. The husband of eighteen years. He and his thirteen year old daughter Gianna were killed in a helicopter on their way to a basketball game tonight. We celebrate a remarkable life and a man who was much more than a basketball nights. What can I say. Mom while. Good evening everyone thank you for joining us tonight is a very sad night for. For us all nine are dead in that helicopter crash in nine tragedies nine reasons to mourn. A pilot and eight passengers I'm joined here by my junior made. Co anchor Michael Strahan and no Kobe was a good friend of yours it's very comfortable for you to be here plumber and all they. Our colleague at ESP added and we are being broadcast right now on ABC and ESPN and that is apart but testament. To Kobe Bryant because he was bigger than basketball would be. But beyond that and I was around a group of people when the news was coming and Tom is this like. Such disbelief. So shop so often there is shock when there is sudden loss and we feel Robin like there's an ending. But this feels a bit different it feels like something and someone was taken IBC most painfully. From the Bryant family. But in a greater sense from the sporting world somebody you had so much left to achieve. Would already built a legacy in only cresting in his moment. It's just tragic any we look at it refused to give basketball world book and to world of the holders of the guard. We made an impact on the court off the court a great father a great friend. A great husband and and and the legend. And gone to some. And we're all excited to see what he was going to do. Next I think that in part of what has really taken us. A back so we Havel a lot that we're gonna discuss this war that today but we're gonna go right now to Calabasas California where the crash took place hadn't met government. Is there forced mass. Rob and this is still very much an active scene a neighbor bringing in heavy equipment you can see that. Bulldozer behind me we've seen a TV's. Brought in all to handle the treacherous terrain that mountainside where the crash happened so steep and just moments ago just beyond that caution tape we saw the quarter struck. Round the corner. We believe taking the bodies away. Process. Point 01 helicopter went around. Tonight tragedy in the hills of Calabasas California. A helicopter took off at 906 AM from Orange County airport in sign. In BA legend Coby Bryant he's thirteen year old daughter Gionta and seven others. It crashed forty minutes later the jumper bursting into flames killing everyone on board the column of smoke seen from my past. Fire crews racing crash site perched already steep hills are. Paramedics were poised sit down into the incident. Early into. Incidents. Home video search of the area four survivors. Unfortunately. All the survivors I'm Bora were determined to have been. Perished eyewitnesses say they saw the chopper flying low and hold the engine sputtering before the crash I heard someone who is available. There was so elegantly invented it was in June was. Not suited. Running last I heard a a helicopter just lying just wait too low and I had like allowed outside noise is the individuals that saw the aircraft. Said it was coming down and in a fairly significant rated speed and impacted the ground on the hillside behind me here. Authorities investigating what caused the chopper to go down. Firefighters and hand crews worked to extinguish the fire wall carefully preserving the crash site for investigation. And tonight dozens gathered here near the scene of the crash a chant of Kobe going up. As they mourned the man who meant so much to Los Angeles I'm sick right now. I'm sick do something that we met this young man in the number 24 Jersey named Bryant after his parents favorite basketball player. The chopper was heading to the mob a sports academy co founded by Bryant and that these two basketball player scheduled to play each youngest team. Which Bryant coached. Was there are supposed to big game today. Windows doesn't play his teammates were. We got the news and it just kind of like everybody stopped the game stop its a lot of us from Annapolis like everybody's argument on their knees. Well these video posted on Twitter today showing that moment of anguish and shark in the gym. Tributes pouring it inspired a whole generation. Of young athletes Shaquille O'Neal writing there's no words to express the pain I'm going through with these tragic. Michael Jordan writing. He was. And a creative force other victims identified are orange coast college head baseball coach John alto belly his wife Carrie. And daughter Alyssa the NTSB is on their way to the crash site tonight. And deceive your sense of how bad the weather was this morning the LAPD grounding all of its helicopters saying the weather. Did not meet the standards for flight the key now is going to be preserving that crash scene there are law enforcement officers across the hillside to ensure that. Nobody tampers with that crash site it has to remain pristine. For investigators to learn. Exactly what happened here.

Regarding the recent article, “Protests scheduled for Trump rally in Wildwood”:
 Have you ever seen Republicans protesting at a President Obama rally, or at any Democrat rally, for that matter? I think not. Conservatives, by and large, understand that those who have different ideas and beliefs than they do also have a right to gather.
 Shayla Woolfort, one of the protest organizers, said, “When hate comes to town, we have a moral obligation to take action and not look the other way.” To that I would say that the protesters themselves are the haters. They hate Trump, and are incapable of recognizing any of the positive things he has done for this country, many of which have benefitted minorities, and some of the very fringe groups that wish to protest him.

I didn't make it to midnight on New Year's Eve. Well, I guess technically I did since I didn't actually fall asleep until after midnight. But I was in bed with the lights out when the clock, that I didn't hear, struck the new year.
 Over the years, I've come to recognize that the arrival of the new year isn't dependent upon my staying awake to ring it in. Whether or not I'm awake at the stroke of midnight, the new year still arrives. And that's rather freeing! Despite the more-than-you'd-think emails mistakenly addressed to me as "Father Time," I bear no responsibility for the transition from one year to the next.
 I didn't make any New Year's resolutions this year. This isn't unusual for me, as I can't remember the last time I did. I can get all philosophical, "time is a false construct," or delude myself into thinking to channel Mr. Rogers, I'm fine just the way I am. While my wife and brother have made a pact to give up sugar, I just couldn't come up with anything. Despite all the "New Year! New You!" ads for gyms and hair care products, I'm pretty sure God still loves the old me.
 This week a friend forwarded me an article about a Lutheran pastor from Canada with the headline "Meet the Strongest Priest in the World." Apparently, the Rev. Kevin Fast, who bears a strong resemblance to a jacked-up Santa Claus, pulled three firetrucks weighing 109 tons across a 100-foot parking lot in just 34 seconds. He's also on record, with video evidence, as having pulled 15 cars at once.
 All of which is to say, I could resolve to double my efforts at the gym. Pastor Fast, maybe I could, ironically enough, outrun him, makes my exploits on the StairMaster at Planet Fitness seem rather pedestrian.
 I didn't eat black-eyed peas on New Year's Day. This brings good luck, apparently. Black-eyed peas weren't part of my tradition growing up, or maybe my parents just decided to take their chances. But either way, seeing all those Facebook posts of people preparing black-eyed peas for their New Year's Day celebrations makes me wonder what I'm missing and how luckier I'd be if I'd partaken.
 There's evidence that the tradition goes back to Rosh Hashanah and the celebration of the Jewish New Year, but these days it's mostly a Southern thing. In the Civil War era, black-eyed peas were grown as food for livestock and became a staple of slaves. When Gen. Sherman undertook his infamous March to the Sea, he destroyed all the crops deemed useful to the Confederate Army. He ignored the black-eyed peas, figuring they weren't fit for human consumption. Those left in the South gratefully subsisted on the peas and ever since they have been viewed as a symbol of luck and prosperity, particularly fit for a celebration of the New Year.
 So while 2020 begins for me with many unrealized traditions, I am nonetheless optimistic. Hindsight may indeed be 2020, but I pray that we will have the foresight to live into the future with peace, hope, and love. In the end, that's really all that matters.

The first question I would have to ask is, “What is your vision? What do you want?” Because what has to be talked about is within the context of what their desires are. Once I understand that, I’ll be looking at the 170 companies on the career floor that can provide opportunities to meet their needs. Sometimes we find that students will be thinking about their major, but not all the companies they can work for are based on their degree. They may have their sights set on a particular industry, like a marketing company. A student may say, “I’m in marketing, I want to work for Coca-Cola, or I want to work for Pepsi.” But when you broaden their vision to understand that there’s marketing in everything, all of a sudden, companies out of the 170 that they weren’t considering, they [now] realize they can interview there. I would then ask them, “Is there an entrepreneurial opportunity for you here? If your vision is to own your own company, then think about what’s the best company to work for, that will allow you to learn while you’re there so you’re able to start your own without starting from scratch.”

SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) — With a fearsome front four capable of pressuring quarterbacks without blitzes, a lockdown cornerback in Richard Sherman and the speed at linebacker and safety to limit big plays, the San Francisco 49ers had the league's stingiest pass defense in a decade.
 Shutting down Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs' passing game in the Super Bowl will be a far tougher challenge than anything the Niners have faced this season.
 “His mobility is unique. His arm strength is ridiculous. He's very, very accurate,” defensive coordinator Robert Saleh said. “But what I don't think people give him enough credit for is that he actually plays quarterback. There's a lot of people, there's a lot of quarterbacks in this league that will say no to number one and then it just becomes street ball. He gets rid of the ball on time. He puts it where it needs to be. He hits a lot of throws in rhythm. And when he needs to take his shot, he knows how to buy time in the pocket and do it. So he's a superstar in every way you can possibly imagine and he's going to be tough to deal with.”

At Hubco, a 100-year-old Hutchinson business that makes cloth bags, as much has changed over the decades as has stayed the same.
 The operation is still in the 23,000-square-foot building behind the Carey Building and City Hall where it was started in 1919 by Emerson Carey and Jim Dick, to make bags for holding Carey Salt.
 Over the years, numerous small additions have been made, expanding the plant's footprint by almost 40 percent and improving climate control, but the core building at 215 S. Poplar has remained.
 Manufacturing equipment has come and gone, but the types of products manufactured are essentially unchanged.
 Their customers and suppliers have also come and gone, said company president Trey McPherson, whose grandfather owned the plant for years, but their focus on producing quality customized packaging has not.
 And while none of the employees are quite that old, several have spent decades in the plant, some even in the same job their entire careers after joining a parent in the business.
 As it moves beyond its centennial year, Hubco - formerly Hutchinson Bag Company - is also being recognized as the Hutchinson / Reno County Chamber of Commerce Small Business of the Month for January.
 Legacy
 Dick bought Carey's share of the business after a few years and expanded into other cloth bag offerings. The company is now under its sixth set of owners, McPherson said, including himself and a group of four other employees.
 His dad was employed by the railroad, so growing up the family moved a lot, McPherson said. But they often visited McPherson's grandfather, John Rimmer, and spent time at the plant.
 He initially wanted to be an architect, McPherson said, but while studying business at Emporia State University he did an internship with his grandfather and recognized the opportunity for a future in Hutchinson.
 "I have no regrets," said McPherson, who came to work in Hutchinson in 1992, straight out of college. "I can count on one hand the number of bad days I've had here."
 Among the things that have changed, McPherson said, is that Hubco is now one of just three domestic manufacturers of cotton and burlap packaging left in the U.S.
 A changing fabric
 While its supply of fabric was once sourced almost entirely domestically, now the inverse is true, he said, with materials used for its packaging manufactured mostly overseas due to cost and regulations. Only a pair of fabric mills that have been partners over the years remain as U.S. providers.
 When he started 27 years ago, McPherson said, their top three customers were all flour mills. Today, however, very little flour is sold in cloth bags as consumers purchase smaller amounts in paper packages. In fact, most cloth packaging has been replaced by cheaper paper or plastic.
 Still, Hubco currently has more than 60 customers across the country and overseas, McPherson said.
 "In our first 99 years, we did no advertising," he said. "Everything was by word of mouth, which is your best advertising. Now, though, we're going to start playing some offense. We're going after new markets."
 Uses for its various-sized sacks include feed, seed, and various other agricultural items. Other products found in Hubco bags include coffee, tea, snacks, soaps, whiskey, dry mixes for cooking and samples from the petroleum and ore industries. Examples are the Gold Minute nugget bubblegum and cookie doughs at William Sonoma stores.
 Besides custom four-color screen-printing, Hubco offers options like plain and custom printed tags, and different closure options, including drawstrings, drawcords and tie tapes.
 As the textile bag industry has declined, it afforded Hubco the opportunity to acquire more equipment from the closing businesses. The ability to have equipment repaired, however, has become a challenge. The plant employs two people full time who maintain its 65 different machines and fabricate new parts from scratch when something breaks down.
 Dedicated workforce
 At its height nearly 30 years ago, the plant employed as many as 110 people, McPherson said. Today, primarily due to updated and more efficient equipment, they employ 25.
 They're also employing 10 inmates at the Hutchinson Correctional Facility's minimum security East Unit, a number that fluctuates with orders and the season.
 Starting about 25 years ago, shifts begin at 6 a.m. to accommodate building temperatures. Though it's now climate controlled, they still start at the same time, though now the days go longer after they switched a couple of years ago to a 4-day workweek. That allows maintenance of the machines on the off days.
 Two of those employees are the plant's longest-serving workers, Carolyn Wheeler, who's been there 46 years, and Connie Burns, whose mother worked there and suggested she start when she turned 18.
 Thanks to the early workday, Wheeler said she worked two jobs for more than 20 years. At 71, however, she's cut back to the one. She has no immediate plans to retire.
 Burns, 58, has done the same job on a serger sewing machine for 39 years. Paid by the piece, she zips a bag through the machine one way and then another in seconds. Her mother, Esther Postier, worked there for 36 years.
 "Some days are harder than others, but I enjoy doing it," Burn said. "I'm not sorry about staying here so long."

LUBBOCK, Tx) -- They say that everything’s bigger in Texas.
 I can confirm it—especially when it comes to basketball games. The Kentucky Wildcats—behind another BIG 25-point, 14-rebound, 4-block performance by Nick Richards—traveled down to Lubbock and handed the Texas Tech Red Raiders a BIG 76-74 defeat on their own home court. In their typical nerve-wracking fashion, the Wildcats lost a 10-point lead in regulation and came back to win it in overtime.
 It was another BIG road win for Kentucky—this time as part of the Big 12/SEC Challenge between two programs as different as night and day.
 On one hand, you had Kentucky and their blue-blooded royalty making only their second appearance against Tech in Lubbock. The first time was a long time ago—1965 to be exact—when Lyndon Johnson was president and John Calipari was entering first grade. If you’re old enough to remember, that was the year of Rupp’s Runts, as the Wildcats won 66-60.
 On the other hand, you had the Red Raiders—a moderately successful program on the rise—fresh off of an impressive NCAA Tournament run last year where they lost to Virginia in the championship game. Coach Chris Beard, anointed as the next coming of Coach Cal, was looking for another significant notch on his ever-expanding belt of a resume.
 “It sucks that someone has to lose a game like this,” a disappointed Beard said in his postgame presser. “But credit Kentucky. I have a lot of respect for their program. Congratulations to them. What a great win on the road.”
 Like Sherman’s scorched earth march to the sea, John Calipari’s road journey through the South has been just as defining. Athens, Fayetteville, and now Lubbock. If not for a miraculous half-court bank shot at the buzzer, you could easily add Columbia to the list.
 Those are hard places to play. As much as Kentucky fans expect their team to win every game, I’m not sure how much of BBN expected wins in all these hostile environments. John Calipari talked about “fight” from day one. This team’s finally giving it to him.
 They’ll crash your Super Bowl, eat all your food, drink all your beer, steal your girlfriend, and ruin your weekend.
 I’m not sure there could have been a bigger buildup to this one. Tech students camped out all night and were treated to free beer before the game. And then—dressed in all black—poured like lava into the arena two-and-a-half hours before the tip. The flow kept coming and coming. By the time pregame introductions rolled around, it truly was the biggest darn student section I had ever seen.
 At the end of the day, this Kentucky team found the will to win. Ashton Hagans didn’t have a particularly sterling offensive game, but if you need a defensive stop or a steal to ice the game, then he’s your man. He’s always been all about fight and toughness. And he’s still the heart and soul of this team—a cold-blooded assassin when March rolls around. He’s the best point guard in the country according to Coach Cal. I’ll take him over anybody else.
 Immanuel Quickley has been as consistent as they come. In this game, he poured in 21 points on 4-8 three-point shooting, including that half-court heave at the end of the half that ended up being the difference in the game. To have another solid, experienced, and dependable floor leader is a luxury not many other teams possess. Kentucky has that in Quickley. He’s a horse you can ride into the Final Four.
 And finally, there’s no one like Nick. Nick Richards is not only playing himself into a first-round NBA draft choice, he may be moving into lottery territory. The guy got himself into shape, grew a new pair of hands, stopped going for shot fakes, and started draining jump shots. And he did all of it at seven feet tall—and you can’t teach seven feet. Keep this up, and Kentucky’s postseason chances just increased ten-fold.
 “I kissed Nick on the forehead,” Coach Cal said after the game. “I said (to the players), ‘there are about three of you in this room who need to do this, but I will do it for you.’ So I kissed him on the forehead.”
 You’re not alone, Coach. I’m sure there are a lot of Kentucky fans who would love to kiss him too. One thing’s for sure–you can kiss Nick goodbye to the NBA.
 The Cats travel to Auburn next Saturday. Time to ruin another weekend.

However, Tennis Australia has taken an equivocal stance after agreeing to mark the anniversary but stressing it "does not agree with Court's personal views, which have demeaned and hurt many in our community over a number of years".
 Court, now a church pastor and based in Perth, Western Australia, has long attracted controversy over her views on race and homosexuality.
 The Australian once praised South Africa's apartheid system, said "tennis is full of lesbians" and described transgender children as "the work of the devil".
 WTA founder Billie Jean King is one senior figure to call for Melbourne Park's Margaret Court Arena to be renamed, and fellow American legend Martina Navratilova is also a frequent critic.
 Court last week said she was being "persecuted" for her beliefs and that many people had voiced support.
 "I teach what the Bible says about things and you get persecuted for it," she told ABC radio.
 "But I still believe all that should not come in to 50 years ago, what I did in tennis for my nation."
 Melbourne Park will host the Glam Slam, one of the world's biggest LGBTQI+ tennis tournaments, this week, and this year unveiled gender-neutral toilets at Rod Laver Arena, the centre court.
 McEnroe said he hoped Serena Williams, who has 23 Grand Slam titles, would soon eclipse Court's record of 24.
 "Serena, do me a favour, get two more Grand Slams this year and get to 25 so we can leave Margaret Court and her offensive views in the past, where they both belong," he said.

Bryant was on his way to a travel basketball game with his daughter Gianna Bryant, who was 13, when the helicopter crashed, sources said. Those aboard the helicopter included another player and parent. Los Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva said in a news conference that there were no survivors, and according to the flight manifest, there were nine people on board the helicopter.

The news of retired basketball superstar Kobe Bryant killed along with his 13-year-old daughter Gianna and others in a helicopter crash has shocked the world. Bryant was poised to receive the Holy Grail of basketball – entering the prestigious Hall of Fame later this year.
 Instead, the world will mourn the tragic and premature death of a once-in-a- generation basketball achiever, a five-time National Basketball Association (NBA) championship winner, a former NBA Most Valuable Player, 11-time All NBA first-teamer, 18-time All Star, 9-time All NBA Defensive Team member and owner of other accomplishments.
 For all these accolades, Bryant, who wanted to be called the “Black Mamba”, will be known for being the closest to basketball’s best-ever player – Michael Jordan. Bryant was Jordanesque (both were 6’6’’ tall and listed at 220 pounds for large parts of their career) in most aspects of his game – he could score in the paint, rattle the rims with dunks, shoot the three from the perimeter, hit contested shots with a defender’s hand in his face, take over during clutch moments and play the closer, rev up his defensive intensity when needed and bottle up opponent wing players; all of which contributed to his winning five championships with the only team he played for – the Los Angeles Lakers. He was also Jordanesque in his maniacal intensity, whether it was in turning up for practice and goading his teammates to improve, using the NBA off-season to add newer aspects to his repertoire, working on his physical fitness in order to compete and play gruelling minutes game after game and in his dedication to win it all.
 Bryant came up just short in the Jordan comparison on one key metric – efficiency. His devotion to doing-it-all led him to take outrageous shots and complaints about hogging the ball and despite his humongous success, he didn’t really scale the Jordan peak. That accolade could be soon owned by current day Laker great LeBron James, but Bryant’s stardom and popularity was as high as any other NBA superstar’s and will remain so. Bryant’s legacy firmly establishes him among the top dozen NBA players ever, with some situating him closer to the Top 6 – a spectacular feat for a player who joined the league right after finishing up high school and remaining with the Lakers all his career.
 ## O’Neal-Bryant dynasty
 Kobe’s game also evolved over the years since his NBA entry. In his keenness to emulate Jordan, he started off as a gunner – who could forget his air ball shots against Utah Jazz in the 1997 playoffs? Under the tutelage of coach Phil Jackson, though, Bryant mellowed and bought into the team concept and soon formed a dominant partnership with the-force-of-nature center Shaquille O’Neal. The O’Neal-Bryant dynasty lasted till 2004 with three consecutive championships between 2000 and 2002. Bryant and the Lakers were down and out till Jackson returned as coach again in the late 2000s and forged yet another winning team, this time revolving around Bryant’s stardom and leading to two more championships in 2009 and 2010.

Democrats argued their side of the impeachment case for three days last week, warning that Trump will persist in abusing his power and endangering American democracy unless Congress intervenes to remove him before the 2020 election.
 On Saturday, the president’s attorneys said there was no evidence that Trump made the military aid contingent on the country announcing an investigation into Biden. They also accused Democrats of omitting information that was favorable to Trump’s case.
 Once Trump’s team concludes, senators will have 16 hours to ask questions of both the House impeachment prosecutors and the president’s legal team. Their questions must be in writing, and Chief Justice John Roberts, who has been presiding over the trial, will read them aloud.
 Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., told reporters Saturday that Republicans expected to get together on Monday to start formulating a list of questions.
 “We will meet as a conference and decide what questions we want to pose, what the order may be of those of those questions,” he said.
 After the question-and-answer time has elapsed, the Senate will take up the question of whether to consider new witnesses and evidence — a question that could be more politically complicated with the account in Bolton’s book.
 Four Republicans would have to break ranks to join Democrats to extend the trial for an undetermined amount of time.
 Democrats have been especially seeking testimony from Bolton and acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney.

The Origin looks more like a shuttle or bus than a passenger car, with two benches that face each other, no steering wheel, pedals or space for an operator. The doors slide open, rather than hinge outward, and the entry is low to the ground and three times larger than that of an average car to make room for passengers to enter and exit.
 Cruise says there will be no surprises when the vehicle arrives and no delay in ordering a ride. Because they're autonomous, the vehicles run around the clock -- with breaks for charging and cleaning -- and with a designated fleet, customers know what kind of vehicle they'll get.
 Much as Henry Ford's iconic Model T turned the gasoline-powered automobile into a mass-market product, the Cruise Origin aims to make mobility-as-a- service a compelling consumer option.
 After it launches the ride-hailing service, Cruise also will use the vehicles to deliver cargo.
 "We're going to maximize the utilization of it. We'll use it in every conceivable way we can," Ammann said.
 GM has not said when production will begin. But at least one forecaster expects the Origin to be built at GM's Detroit-Hamtramck Assembly starting in 2022. The plant will also build four other EVs in the next few years.

In the end, what AOC truly wants is government control. Worker collectives won't do the trick. Only top-down government redefinition of the value of labor will. When AOC claims that capitalists merely leech off the true value of labor, she suggests that labor can be measured without reference to the market. How would AOC measure the value of such labor? Presumably through appeals to "fairness." There is only one problem with this method: It simply doesn't work. Consumers determine the value of products; producers do not. The diffuse informational system of the free market, which rewards the power of entrepreneurship, rather than punishing it, creates prosperity; top-down control creates poverty.

Dat meldt een Amerikaanse bron die nauw bij het plan is betrokken. Eerder was bekendgemaakt dat de ontmoetingen dinsdag zouden plaatsvinden.
 Trump zal eerst Netanyahu ontmoeten en daarna Gantz. De besprekingen gaan dinsdag verder. Netanyahu en Gantz maken zich op voor nieuwe verkiezingen begin maart. Gantz is met zijn centrumpartij Blauw en Wit de belangrijkste uitdager van de rechtse Likud van Netanyahu.
 Trump stelde eerder dat zijn vredesplan voor de regio een „uitstekend” plan is, waar ook de Palestijnen zich volgens hem in zullen kunnen vinden. „Ze zullen er eerst misschien negatief op reageren, maar het is werkelijk erg positief voor hen”, zei de president. Wat het plan inhoudt, is tot nu toe geheim gehouden.
 Palestijnse leiders hebben zondag gedreigd zich terug te trekken uit de belangrijkste bepalingen van de Oslo-vredesakkoorden, waarin de afspraken met Israël zijn vastgelegd, als Trump zijn vredesplan bekendmaakt. „Het initiatief van Trump zal de tijdelijke bezetting (van Palestijns gebied) door Israël veranderen in een permanente bezetting”, zei de Palestijnse hoofdonderhandelaar Saeb Erekat.
 Hamas-leider Ismail Haniya zei dat het vredesplan van Trump zou kunnen leiden tot hernieuwd Palestijns geweld. „Wij verklaren met klem dat de ”deal van de eeuw” niet zal doorgaan. Het nieuwe complot tegen Palestina is gedoemd te mislukken en zou de Palestijnen kunnen leiden naar een nieuwe fase in hun strijd tegen Israël”, zei Haniya in een verklaring.
