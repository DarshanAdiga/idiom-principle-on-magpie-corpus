Like her friend and colleague Justice Scalia, Ginsburg is perhaps best remembered for her stinging dissents. In _Burwell_ v. _Hobby Lobby Stores_ (2014), she dissented from a decision holding that family-owned and other closely held companies could opt out of the Affordable Care Act’s mandate to offer insurance coverage for certain birth control methods that business owners equate with abortion. Rather than focusing exclusively on competing rights, Ginsburg cogently argued that the majority’s ruling contradicted traditional corporation law. How can business owners take advantage of the corporate form to shield themselves from personal liability, but then argue that the corporation and the owners are effectively one and the same for purposes of religious liberty? While the argument ignores the fact that corporations can only act through their owners, it was undoubtedly a shrewd line of attack.

However, with voting already started in a number of states and with just over six weeks left, there are limits to what can be done. Liam Donovan, a veteran Republican strategist, told Intelligencer __ that the impact was limited in most competitive races where campaigns were already amply funded. Instead, Donovan argued that this served as “a quantifiable metric of intensity” as well as a coping mechanism for liberal donors. As he put it: “What it says to me is they feel profoundly out of control, and what better way to get a sense of control by investing in these races; that’s what Democrats are harnessing. These guys are desperate for a way to assert some kind of control on a completely chaotic 2020 — to the tune of a cool $100 million.”

She made her mark in other areas as well. In _Olmstead_ v. _L.C._ (1999), Ginsburg led a 6-3 majority affirming the right of individuals with mental disabilities to community-based housing under the Americans with Disabilities Act. In _Friends of the Earth_ v. _Laidlaw Environmental Services_ (2000), she authored a 7-2 opinion greatly relaxing the “standing” requirements to bring citizen suits to enforce the Clean Water Act. In her opinion, Ginsburg argued that the decision would serve the goal of making polluters “think twice before polluting again.”

CRK, for example, trades right now with a beta of 2.04. The rest of the market is normalized to a beta score of 1.0, which means CRK is more volatile than the average stock. By the same token, CRK should be seen as somewhat more risky for market participants than the average stock.

With the death of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the Supreme Court has lost the senior member of its liberal bloc and a powerful advocate for the progressive view of civil liberties. In recent years, Ginsburg became a pop cultural icon, as she was viewed as a bulwark against an increasingly conservative Court. The battle to replace her adds fresh drama to this fall’s contests for control of the White House and Senate, as the prospect of a 6-3 conservative coalition is likely to galvanize both Left and Right.
