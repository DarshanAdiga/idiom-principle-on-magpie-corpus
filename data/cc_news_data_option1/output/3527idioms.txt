Swings who know what high unemployment is like will think twice about voting against Trump even if they have come to hate him:

Like the professor warned, the public will turn on a dime if the protests aren't peaceful, especially if the Dems don't speak up soon and silly co- opters like that group. There's worse ones out there aren't even anti- colonialists, just taking advantage of the ability to vandalize public property for the hell of it or because they have some grudge against a celebrity depicted. It's way outta control. Every night there's one. They've got to start going through proper channels if they really care (like with the TR statue) and stop the random vandalism and calling the media to come see their performance....

The Brussels prosecutor’s office has instructed police forces to draw up reports of pickpocketing and shoplifting in Dutch as far as possible, to avoid having the cases dropped or the thieves dealt with leniently.

No no, I learned at Dagblog that you just have to energize the liberal base to do more "outreach" to drag more urban couch potatoes to the polls.

Hitler had a base of veterans who were pissed off at the results of WW1 and the Kaiser who surrendered. His cultural revolution brought children into his movement once the regime got started.

We may have missed out on epic summer socials, but we can still picnic in the park and find the perfect wine to carry across verdant gardens and beauty spots. Take this tip-top tube for example, which offers a slice of Southern Italy with fresh pear and citrus flavours, and hints of honeysuckle and nuts peeking through. One of the best boxed wines around, it also has our seal of approval to be kept in the fridge as your go-to white at the push of a button.

I would have happily voted for Bernie in the situation we are in. Especially because I know he couldn't execute his pie in the sky dreams. Nothing wrong with him but the viciousness of some of his diehard fans. He'd be fine as Prez, I've followed his actual career in the Senate and what he did not just what he said.

Particularly in the case of what are called petty crimes, the prosecutor now appears to be seeking to redress the balance by asking police to write up their cases in Dutch, so they can be handled by the Dutch-speaking courts, thus relieving the pressure on the French-speaking side.

The state as a whole is just not liberal! Just not a world that fits in any shape or form. They like their Democrats sensible, down to earth, not liberal, Reagan Dem style though not as hard and fast as Michigan. Joe does fit the bill I've got to say. Plenty of them voted for Obama both times, another sensible, not liberal type of guy. The "no drama" thing a big plus as well I would imagine. (Obama's grandparents that helped raise him were actually sounded like Wisconsin type people).

“This procedure also only applies to foreigners who do not speak either national language. A French-speaking Belgian will be tried in French. A Dutch speaker in Dutch, that's the rule.”

As for Milwaukee blacks, a reminder that this is their world, and Milwaukee city & county and surrounding burbs are already as about as divisive as one could get segregation wise before Trump was in the picture. Like total segregation. And both sides enable it to the max. The black culture would get any disinfo. word of mouth, or from celebs they are fans of, not so much from political internet. There's two cultures there in Milwaukee and they do not mix. Any blacks who manage to get a good education and avoid prison or multiple pregnancy while young get out and go elsewhere.

Trump's base is really all over the world. No different then the Taliban who just won't be dragged kicking and screaming into modern life, or nationalists wanting to maintain nations while globalism is already a given or ethnic tribalists wanting to revive and then retreat into their ancient traditions. Air travel, cell phones, people from across the globe marrying each other and having children: the new new world, they can't deal with it.

“He asks us, if a suspect does not speak either of the two national languages, to interrogate them with an interpreter who translates the suspect's statement into Dutch. The report must also be drawn up in Dutch. The prosecutor explained to me that, if the case report is in Dutch, the suspect can be placed under an arrest warrant and summonsed, because there is almost always room at the Dutch-language hearings.”
