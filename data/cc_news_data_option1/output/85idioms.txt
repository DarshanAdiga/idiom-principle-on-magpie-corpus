Ace Indian women shuttlers PV Sindhu and Saina Nehwal registered convincing wins to sail into the second round but world championships bronze-medallist B Sai Praneeth and seasoned campaigner Kidambi Srikanth bowed out of the Malaysia Masters Badminton tournament on Wednesday. Reigning world champion Sindhu seeded sixth, took just 35 minutes to beat Evgeniya Kosetskaya of Russia 21-15, 21-13 in the first round.


  The other Indian in the fray in the women's singles event, London Olympics bronze medallist Saina needed just 36 minutes to get the better of Belgium's Lianne Tan.


  The unseeded Saina brushed aside Tan 21-15, 21-17 in just 36 minutes of action. This was the first time the two were facing each other.


  Both Sindhu and Saina have struggled in the past year making a series of early exits with the former failing to defend the World Tour Finals crown last month.

International forecasts indicate sun and clouds mixed for Chennai for the day today (Wednesday), turning clear to partly cloudy into the night, with a temperature high of 29 degrees Celsius and low of 22 degrees Celsius.
 An almost similar outlook with south-easterly winds is valid for tomorrow (Thursday). Meanwhile, the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts agreed with the US National Centres for Environmental Prediction-Global Forecast System models in terms of the outlook for occasionally wet weather popping up along and off the Kerala coast over the next few days.
 ## North India
 In the North, winter weather for New Delhi bristled with prospects for thundershowers and fog early on Wednesday. The winds are north-westerly as a cyclonic circulation hovered over North-West Rajasthan. This is the offspring of a western disturbance that crossed into North Pakistan today en route to North-West India across the border.
 The western disturbance-offspring circulation would set the tone for regional weather over the next couple of days as well. Once the combo weakens in intensity and moves away to the East-North-East as it normally does, cold north-westerly winds will blow in from across the border to lower the mercury level. The cold spell will be broken as the next western disturbance chugs in from Saturday.
 The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has forecast fairly widespread to widespread rain/snow over the hills with the possibility of isolated heavy falls over Himachal Pradesh and adjoining Uttarakhand until tomorrow (Thursday). Scattered to fairly widespread rain is forecast over Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi and Uttar Pradesh during this period while it would be isolated over East Rajasthan.
 Isolated thunderstorms and lightning accompanied by hailstorms are likely over Haryana, Chandigarh, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, East Madhya Pradesh, Vidarbha, Chhattisgarh, Bihar, Jharkhand, plains of Bengal, and Odisha as the western disturbance move to the East.
 Dense to very dense fog is forecast over Uttarakhand, Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi and North Rajasthan in the morning hours of Friday and Saturday. An extended three-day outlook from Monday next suggested fairly widespread to widespread rain/snow with isolated heavy falls for the hills of North-West India and isolated to scattered rainfall for the plains as the fresh western disturbance announces its arrival.

CLARKSTON — More than 300 people turned out to listen to a dialogue about the future of the lower Snake River, its dams, threatened salmon and steelhead runs, agriculture and power production at a meeting in Clarkston on Tuesday evening.                                                            The burgeoning discussion between stakeholders representing various interests was the result of a 115-page draft report commissioned by Washington Gov. Jay Inslee and his Orca Task Force that focused on attitudes of Washington residents on the dams and fish.                                                            The report will help guide Inslee’s comments on a coming federal Environmental Impact Statement on the Columbia and Snake River Hydropower System and its effects on protected salmon and steelhead. The EIS will examine, among other things, whether the dams should be breached to save the ailing fish runs.                                                            Consultant Jim Kramer gave a brief summary of the report’s findings before overseeing the discussion between people who have often battled over the best way to save the fish. Much of that two-decade-plus-long debate has revolved around dam breaching, an action supported by salmon advocates. Breaching would help the fish migrate to and from the ocean, but would also end use of the river by farmers to get their crops to overseas markets and reduce the hydroelectric capacity of the Pacific Northwest.                                                            Kramer asked panelists how the process might be moved forward. As the discussion evolved beyond normal talking points, some of the panelists began to open up and agree that listening to each other’s needs could produce results.                                                            Bill Newbry, president and chief operating officer of the Pacific Northwest Farmers Cooperative, said if farmers and shippers are to be brought to the table and entertain the possibility of breaching the dams, they first need to see an upgrade in rail and highway infrastructure.                                                            “We need the infrastructure and it’s not there,” he said. “Let’s start with some infrastructure changes and some low-hanging fruit and we can make some changes.”                                                            Sam Mace, of the Save Our Wild Salmon Coalition, said face-to-face talks are helpful and she praised Inslee and other political leaders for recent leadership. But she said people at lower levels can also be effective by meeting face to face.                                                            “I think that kind of dialogue is important,” she said.                                                            Dustin Aherin, a river rafting outfitter from Lewiston who runs trips on the Middle Fork of the Salmon River that has some of the best salmon and steelhead habitat in the region, agreed that dialogue can move the dial.                                                            “We haven’t gotten very far in the recovery process by arguing with one another and developing different plans,” he said. “People like us, the users and affected people, need to realize my actions can adversely affect someone else. We need to work together to find middle ground that keeps my industry whole and other industries whole.”                                                            Birgit Koehler of the Bonneville Power Administration noted the Snake River dams are part of the region’s energy mix and are vital at certain times of year. She said people sometimes say it would be easy to replace the power produced at the dams with wind and solar sources but they don’t acknowledge that wind and solar is also being tapped to replace coal and natural gas-generating plants that are being retired.                                                            “One of my concerns is we do have to have an understanding of what the trade-offs are,” she said.                                                            But Nancy Hirsh of the Northwest Energy Coalition said the power puzzle can be reconciled.                                                            “The energy piece is solvable, there are other sources, other ways to operate the system,” she said.                                                            Joel Kawahara, a commercial fisherman from Quilcene, Wash., said people need to take a long view of the problem.                                                            “We are lacking overall vision of what we want the region to be,” he said. “Do we want an economy to be accommodating to people on the east and west sides equally? I think yes.”                                                            Alex McGregor of the McGregor Co. noted removing the dams and barge transportation would require 43,000 more rail cars and as many as 167,000 trucks. He stressed the need to follow sound science but expressed optimism that solutions can be reached.                                                            “It’s too easy to oversimplify the issues, it’s too easy to try to take on the matter through lawsuits and angry dialogue. The more we can work together and recognize the challenge we face, the better off we are,” he said.                                                            David Johnson, manager of the Nez Perce Tribe Fisheries Department, said a lot of good work has been done to improve imperiled habitat and to raise and release hatchery fish. But he also noted there are wilderness areas that hold pristine spawning habitat that is under used by the fish. He noted that tribal members have sacrificed more than other regional players who are now being asked to compromise.                                                            “Some livelihoods have been held as sacrosanct while others have not been,” he said.                                                             _Eric Barker may be contacted atebarker@lmtribune.com or at (208) 848-2273.

 John was born on January 3, 1960 in Sidney, NE to John Walter and Marilyn Lee (Colson) Reinmuth. In 1968 the family moved to Montana. There he found his love of hard work, learning to be a heavy equipment operator and working in construction. It is where he also found his love of fishing.
 He relocated to Alliance where he worked in farming. He later worked for the City of Alliance Landfill and later at Progress Rail. John then moved to Hemingford in 2015. Health complications would require John to take an early retirement. Even with his deteriorating health he continued to build a home for his family. He was a Jack of all trades and a Master of all he put his hands too. He will forever be known for his doing anything for anyone and expecting nothing in return. John also never knew a stranger.

Though Netflix faces increasingly stiff competition, particularly in the U.S., in my view, it's a better investment option now than iQiyi. Netflix still has room to grow in international markets, and it's already profitable. By contrast, iQiyi is still crawling toward profitability, a destination that will be harder to reach given China's economic slowdown, competition from Tencent, and the higher expenses inherent in producing more original content. While iQiyi's revenue growth may pick up once again -- whereas Netflix's may be hindered due to competition from Disney+ -- Netflix's stock is likely to outperform iQiyi's in the long run.

“At the beginning, I was just kind of shocked, kind of star-struck I guess you could say, because I’ve always watched them on TV,” Woolridge said. “And then just being able to come here and step in these shoes is almost like a dream.”


  Gilder was hoping just to play again. The former Texas state player of the year as a senior in high school should be done with his college career. Last year at Texas A&M was supposed to be the conclusion.


  But he never played a minute for the Aggies in 2018-19 after three years of being a major contributor.


  Gilder missed the start of the season because of a knee injury. He was then diagnosed with a blood clot. He missed his entire senior season with the Aggies and wasn’t cleared to resume basketball activities until after the season was over. And when former Texas A&M coach Billy Kennedy was fired after the season, Gilder decided to move on as well.


  His choices were Texas Tech — last year’s national runner-up — and Gonzaga, the team the Red Raiders beat to reach the Final Four.


  Going to Texas Tech would have meant staying close to home and around things that were familiar to Gilder.


  Which is partly why he ended up at Gonzaga. There was also the chance to play the kind of style he always wanted, along with the possibility of being on a team that would give him a chance to play in the NCAA tournament again.


  “Just the situation, knowing what they had lost and what kind of position they were in and knowing I could come and fit right in,” Gilder said. “And it’s the way I’ve always wanted to play, up- tempo, fast, just get up and down the court and scoring.”

But she said she was encouraged that they detailed a U.S. approach centered on values such as trustworthiness and fairness.

Looking more broadly at the iPad product line, Apple has done a great job in the last couple of years at bringing features previously available only on the iPad Pro to the rest of the iPad line. There’s Apple Pencil support across the line and Smart Keyboard support on the iPad and iPad Air. But the iPad Pro still needs ways to differentiate itself from the non-pro iPad models.                                                            Improving support for pointing devices will help companies like Brydge push the boundaries of iPad accessories, yes—but Apple could also benefit. Imagine a next-generation Smart Keyboard that includes cursor control, via a trackpad or other touch-sensitive surface. I’m confident that Apple could make a pro-level iPad accessory that would blow away the third-party accessory makers in terms of quality—but the software needs an upgrade to make it happen.                                                            Finally, improving pointing-device support could potentially open the door for an entirely new category of device in the iOS family. An iOS-based laptop would offer a rich app ecosystem, a familiar touchscreen interface, and presumably spectacular battery life. Some people prefer the shape of a laptop, but don’t need the features of a Mac or PC. For them, an iOS laptop could be a great product—and it would be even better if it included a trackpad in addition to a touchscreen.                                                            When I’m working away from my iMac Pro, I’m using an iPad Pro. I love its power and flexibility. It can be a laptop when I need it to be, and a tablet when I don’t. The more flexible the iPad platform is, the better. I hope Apple sees that and does something about it in iPadOS 14.                                                                                             *[FT]: Financial Times

Lynn Bickley, prosecuting, asked for the matter to go to crown court, said that there was no bail application and asked that McConnell be remanded in custody.


  Sukhy Ark, for McConnell, told the court that his client denies the charge and that a bail application would be made in due course.


  Maciejewski and Mann then appeared in the dock together. Both were dressed in grey tracksuits.


  Maciejewski, was short with thick brown hair. Mann, had a black beard and black hair. He stood taller than Maciejewski.


  Ms Bickley said the case should be sent to crown court and and bail application could only be heard by a judge.


  Simon Stevens, representing Maciejewski, made no representations.


  Mr Ark also represented Mann. He indicated a not guilty plea.


  Both men came in wearing handcuffs and were placed back in them as they were led away from the dock.

  So you've taken the plunge and decided to go Paleo in 2020. Good for you! But have you figured out what you're going to snack on throughout the day?


  Even though moderation is the key to dietary success, that doesn't mean you shouldn't snack... and that you shouldn't indulge every once in a while! And the best part is, you can indulge without blowing your diet. If you're craving popcorn, try some popped lotus seeds instead. Need some more crunchy options? There's some great flavors of grain-free crackers to choose from. How about something with a little heat? A ghost pepper pork and beef stick might do the trick. And chocoholics don't need to forego their favorite sweet treat, they just need to upgrade to one that has organic chocolate and unrefined coconut sugar.


  To help you as you embark on your Paleo journey, we've picked out a handful of snacks that will satisfy all your tasting needs. Shop our faves below!

“You shot and killed a man when you didn’t have to,” she said. “That choice you made that day left two families destroyed.”


  Moreau then sentenced Smith to a total of 11 years in prison: eight for the second-degree murder and three for the use of a firearm in commission of a felony. As Smith stood up to be escorted back to into a holding area, he tilted his head back toward his family and told them he loved them. They all returned the favor, telling him they love him and support him.


  During a late October trial, a jury convicted Smith, 28, of murdering brother-in-law Deon Peatross, 23, of Eden, North Carolina, on Jan. 6, 2019.


  The incident began as a domestic dispute between Smith and his wife, Shameka Smith, and from there escalated into a shootout between the two men. The wife, after learning of her husband’s infidelity, decided to leave him, according to Pittsylvania County Assistant Commonwealth’s Attorney Katerina Holland. Smith decided to confront her at her place of work, where they got into an argument.


  Smith’s face-to-face argument with his wife soon evolved into a dispute with her mother on Facebook, according to court documents. Peatross later joined in the argument, leading to an arranged “meetup” between the two men at the home of Peatross’ grandmother. Smith and a friend drove more than 30 minutes from Martinsville to confront the brother-in-law in Axton.


  Peatross’ mother handed him a revolver for protection in case Smith became violent. When Smith arrived he noticed Peatross had his hands in his pockets and asked if he had a gun, court documents show. After receiving no answer, Smith yelled “We gon to fight,” and went to his car to pull out an assault weapon — an AR-15.

I was sitting around a table at a neighborhood party, enjoying the conversation with some friends before Christmas. The room was loud - the adults were speaking with raised voices, sometimes having to yell across the table at one another - because the nearby rooms were filled with the boisterous chaos that comes with a house full of kids.      But I took notice. Not because of the volume level. But because no one seemed to mind.      The kids, representing a wide range of ages, played video games in one room, while the adults talked in another room, and when things got too rambunctious, a parent stepped in to referee or supervise. But the adult conversation continued largely uninterrupted, as if the boisterous gang of children didn't exist in the next room.      At one point, when my 4-year-old daughter and 8-year-old son were wrestling a human-sized stuffed toy and my youngest ended in up in tears, I apologized for our kids' chaos as my husband stepped away from the adult table to separate our children.      I apologized again, before I realized something refreshing: No one was fazed by our chaos. Everyone at the small gathering had children of their own.      It was a refreshing reminder that every family comes with their own kind of craziness. It was a relief to be in an environment where we could be ourselves, and our kids could be themselves, too.      There is an old saying that children should be seen and not heard. It would be nice if every child were obedient and quiet and did as they were told - but I'm betting that even in my grandparents' day, that even though that was the expectation, there was still some chaos. It's par for the course, part of the territory. We can expect children to be appropriately behaved for a certain amount of time in certain situations - say, in church, at a funeral or at a nice restaurant.      Being the mom of three kids can be exhausting, trying to juggle a full-time job, the kids' busy extracurricular schedules and housework, I'm personally over the idea of trying to keep my children "perfect" all the time.      When my older kids were preschoolers, I'd dress them only in smocked and appliqued boutique clothing. My oldest daughter wouldn't leave the house without a bow in her hair. We expected the kids to behave perfectly, all the time, the second they stepped out our door. But more often than not, we ended out more stressed because one kid ended up with Kool-Aid spilled down their white smocked dress or another kid got gum stuck in their hair or because one of our kids whined at a restaurant and we were worried we'd disturb the other patrons (when, in fact, no one else noticed.)      Eventually, my kids grew out of the smocked-and-appliqued phase. My youngest daughter refuses to wear hair bows at all. And while my younger self would have balked at the idea of buying a printed T-shirt for my little one, my youngest daughter refuses to wear anything "fancy." She rocks her favorite glitter-embossed unicorn T-shirt and leggings happily.      As I've gotten older, I guess I've learned to care less, not about my kids, but about what other people think.      Trying to make children be "perfect" all the time causes too much mental strife and too many gray hairs to be worth it. And staying inside the house for 18 years isn't an option. I hope that other people understand. We try our best. But nobody is perfect.      And while we teach children to behave, we shouldn't ask them to conform to a robotic ideal that's abnormal for who they really are. Sometimes it's refreshing to just be real. And sometimes, that means a little chaos.   Lydia Seabol Avant writes The Mom Stop for The Tuscaloosa News in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. Reach her at lydia.seabolavant@tuscaloosanews.com.

Det var vidst nok snak om komfort, volumen og musiklytning, lad mig fa sat nogle ord pa hvordan Arctis PRO Wireless klarede sig i spil. Alle der spiller computer kender til spillet PUBG, som var en af de helt store online spil, og stadig er det den dag i dag. Her gar det ud pa at finde vaben, sla hinanden ihjel og vaere den sidste overlevende hvad end man spiller alene eller sammen med venner. God lyd er et must i et spil som dette, da det kan vaere et spørgsmal om liv eller død, om man kan høre sine fjender. Der er en masse forskellige praekonfigurerede lydprofiler i softwaren som man kan bruge, eller man kan lave sine egne som jeg gjorde til musiklytningen. Som forventet lød Arctis PRO Wireless stort set identisk med sin kablede lillebror i spil. Lydgengivelsen af vaben og eksplosioner var spot on, og det var naermest let at høre hvor personer og skud kom fra. Surround funktionen er ogsa at finde pa Arctis PRO Wireless, og er hvad jeg vil kalde okay. Den giver et bredere lydbillede, men ikke noget jeg vil kalde for fordelagtigt da det til tider kan gøre det svaerere at fornemme hvor personer rent faktisk befinder sig. Spil med headsettet i stereo, og du er good to go er min konklusion i spil testen.

The strikes, which came as Iran buried Soleimani, raised fears that the two longtime foes were closer to war. But there were some indications that there would not be further retaliation on either side, at least in the short term.


  'All is well!' President Donald Trump tweeted shortly after the missile attacks, adding, 'So far, so good' regarding casualties. Moments earlier, Iran's foreign minister tweeted that Tehran had taken “& concluded proportionate measures in self-defense,” adding that Tehran did “not seek escalation" but would defend itself against further aggression.


  In Tehran, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei called the missile strike on the U.S. bases in Iraq a “slap in the face” of the Americans, adding that military retaliation is not sufficient. “The corrupt presence of the U.S. in the region should come to end,” he said.


  The killing of Soleimani — a national hero to many in Iran — and strikes by Tehran came as tensions have been rising steadily across the Mideast after Trump's decision to unilaterally withdraw America from Tehran's nuclear deal with world powers. They also marked the first time in recent years that Washington and Tehran have attacked each other directly rather than through proxies in the region. It raised the chances of open conflict erupting between the two enemies, who have been at odds since Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution and the subsequent U.S. Embassy takeover and hostage crisis.


  Adding to the chaos and overall jitters, a Ukrainian airplane with at least 170 people crashed after takeoff just outside Tehran on Wednesday morning, killing all on board, state TV reported. The plane had taken off from Imam Khomeini International Airport and mechanical issues were suspected, the report said.


  Iran initially announced only one missile strike, but U.S. officials confirmed both. U.S. defense officials were at the White House, likely to discuss options with Trump, who launched the attack on Soleimani while facing an upcoming impeachment trial in the Senate.


  Iran’s Revolutionary Guard warned the U.S. and its regional allies against retaliating over the missile attack on the Ain al-Asad air base in Iraq’s western Anbar province. The Guard issued the warning via a statement carried by Iran’s state-run IRNA news agency.


  “We are warning all American allies, who gave their bases to its terrorist army, that any territory that is the starting point of aggressive acts against Iran will be targeted,” the Guard said. It also threatened Israel.


  After the strikes, a former Iranian nuclear negotiator posted a picture of the Islamic Republic's flag on Twitter, appearing to mimic Trump who posted an American flag following the killing of Soleimani and others Friday.


  Ain al-Asad air base was first used by American forces after the 2003 U.S.-led invasion that toppled dictator Saddam Hussein, and later saw American troops stationed there amid the fight against the Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria. It houses about 1,500 U.S. and coalition forces. The U.S. also acknowledged another missile attack targeting a base in Irbil in Iraq's semi- autonomous Kurdish region.


  The Iranians fired a total of 15 missiles, two U.S. officials said. Ten hit Ain al-Asad and one the base in Irbil. Four failed, said the officials, who were not authorized to speak publicly about a military operation.


  Two Iraqi security officials said at least one of the missiles appeared to have struck a plane at the Ain al-Asad base, igniting a fire. There were no immediate reports of casualties from the attacks, according to the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity as they had no permission to talk to journalists.


  About 70 Norwegian troops also were on the air base but no injuries were reported, Brynjar Stordal, a spokesperson for the Norwegian Armed Forces told The Associated Press.


  Trump visited the sprawling Ain al-Asad air base, about 100 kilometers (60 miles) west of Baghdad, in December 2018, making his first presidential visit to troops in the region. Vice President Mike Pence also has visited the base.


  “As we evaluate the situation and our response, we will take all necessary measures to protect and defend U.S. personnel, partners and allies in the region,” said Jonathan Hoffman, an assistant to the U.S. defense secretary.


  Wednesday's missile strikes happened a few hours after crowds in Iran mourned Soleimani at his funeral. It also came the U.S. continued to reinforce its own positions in the region and warned of an unspecified threat to shipping from Iran in the Mideast waterways, crucial routes for global energy supplies. U.S. embassies and consulates from Asia to Africa and Europe issued security alerts for Americans. The FAA also warned of a "potential for miscalculation or mis- identification" for civilian aircraft in the Persian Gulf amid in an emergency flight restriction.


  A stampede broke out Tuesday at Soleimani's funeral, and at least 56 people were killed and more than 200 were injured as thousands thronged the procession, Iranian news reports said. Shortly after Wednesday's missile attack, Soleimani's shroud-wrapped remains were lowered into the ground as mourners wailed at the grave site.


  Tuesday's deadly stampede took place in Soleimani's hometown of Kerman as his coffin was being borne through the city in southeastern Iran, said Pirhossein Koulivand, head of Iran’s emergency medical services.


  There was no information about what set off the crush in the packed streets, and online videos showed only its aftermath: people lying apparently lifeless, their faces covered by clothing, emergency crews performing CPR on the fallen, and onlookers wailing and crying out to God.

Art director Sahi Suresh is on a roll. Even as three of his films — _World Famous Lover_ , _Bheeshma_ and _Miss India_ — prepare for release soon, he is already signing fresh projects, including _Tuck Jagdeesh_. Despite all this, he seems a bit unhappy with what happened in 2019. Suresh and his team had put in great effort to make _NTR Kathanayakudu_ and _Mahanayakudu_ as realistic as possible but the films tanked at the box office. He looks back, “I completed 30 films in seven years but the last year was the most unsatisfying. We had other releases like _Raju Gari Gadhi 3_ , _Majili_ and _Arjun Suravaram_ but I haven’t toiled, mentally and physically for any film as much as I did for the NTR biopic. I got appreciated but that is of no use if the film doesn’t work at the box office.”

But whether it would hold true for the future is under a cloud with the socialist hangover in policy making. The last week of 2019 saw the government making all transactions under the RuPay and the UPI payments free, dealing a vital blow to the basic principle of any business enterprise. MDR is the fee accrued by banks, and is generally levied from the merchants processing the transactions. The current MDR charges are capped at 0.6% of cardbased transactions for payments over Rs 2,000. The costs of MDR below Rs 2,000 for banks are borne by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY).

According to Zacks, "ADTRAN's performance is currently dampened by a pause in shipments to a Tier 1 customer in Latin America and a slowdown in spending by a Tier 1 customer in Europe. High technological obsolescence of its products increases operating costs with continuous R&D investments, limiting its growth potential. Increasing cost of sales remains a major cause of concern for ADTRAN. Markedly, its gross profit has declined at a CAGR of 9.6% from 2011 to 2018. Moreover, simmering Sino-U.S. tensions related to trade restrictions imposed on the sale of communication equipment to the firms of China have dented the industry's credibility, and have led to a loss of business for the company. However, ADTRAN continues to optimize its customer, geographic and product diversity momentum as communications service providers scale their network capabilities."

Most of the stuff we see is irresponsible and dangerous because at the end of the day, it's perpetuating violence. If there has been an act of unfathomable violence against someone (be it a man or a woman, let's take gender out of the debate for a bit), to answer it with an equally dastardly act of violence, then to condone it, and show it as the solution, is a far more dangerous act than the previous one. Anything that is 'reactionary,' and looking at the perpetrator as a guy who has no life outside the crime, amounts to short-term justice, and some sort of lynching. It is an act of revenge, and we all know where revenge takes us. It's not a happy place.

Nuovo capitolo nella vicenda del pedinamento dell'ex top manager di Credit Suisse passato a UBS, Iqbal Khan. Stando a quanto riferisce oggi il "Tages-Anzeiger", il ministero pubblico zurighese ha ricevuto altre denunce.                                                            Dopo che Iqbal, fatto pedinare dal suo ex datore di lavoro, ha sporto denuncia penale contro tre detective privati dell'agenzia Investigo, ora questi si difendono querelando a loro volta i coniugi Khan e la polizia, scrive il giornale, cui la procura ha confermato di aver ricevuto le denunce.                                                            Khan e sua moglie vengono accusati di tentata coazione, denuncia mendace, sequestro di persona e sviamento della giustizia, reati simili a quelli di cui il banchiere incolpava i detective nella propria denuncia, afferma ancora il "Tages-Anzeiger".                                                            Querelati pure alcuni agenti della polizia cantonale zurighese per abuso d'autorità, sottrazione di una cosa mobile e falsità in atti formati da pubblici ufficiali o funzionari. Stando al protocollo, durante il fermo dei detective i poliziotti avrebbero sottratto un iPhone, chiavi e una carta bancaria, riferisce il giornale. Ma secondo la denuncia ciò sarebbe ammesso solo con un ordine di perquisizione.                                                            La vicenda era venuta alla luce lo scorso settembre. Il top manager, fino a giugno responsabile della gestione patrimoniale di Credit Suisse e dal primo ottobre in forza a UBS con la stessa funzione (accanto a Tom Naratil), era stato pedinato su ordine del suo vecchio datore di lavoro. Era stato tenuto sotto controllo forse per evitare che, nel passaggio alla concorrente, portasse con sé clienti o altri dipendenti. Era emerso un mondo costellato da profondi rancori personali, dovuti anche al fatto che Khan era vicino di casa del Ceo di Credit Suisse Tidjane Thiam.                                                                                             *[FT]: Financial Times

Our job title at Shelburne Long Term Care is Health Care Aide, and we perform a variety of tasks throughout the day. These tasks vary depending on what is going on, or what needs to be done. On any given day we make beds, wheel residents in and out of the dining room, feed the residents, serve teas and coffees, putting away their clothing, handing out face towels and helping with mechanical lifts. We also find time to have conversations with the residents and sometimes even get to play games with them. Special equipment that we use day to day is hydraulic lifts, slings, oxygen tanks and electric beds.

"The draw has not been kind to us, with us having to face off against the top nine teams in the country in the first nine rounds. We're only taking on the three weak teams, on paper, in the last three rounds (of the first half) of the league. It's very funny and strange. It's a good draw for the other teams but not for us. But what can we say? I've never come across something like this in my entire career; having to play against the nine of the top teams first, before facing off against the bottom three clubs.

It has been strongly rumoured Farrell’s All-Ireland club and county winning team-mate Mick Galvin, who worked with him at under-age level, will come on board as a selector.


  A prominent manager at senior club level in Dublin, Galvin has been acclaimed by the likes of Bernard Brogan for his development of players down through the years.saso


  Outgoing selector and forwards coach Jason Sherlock is close friends with both Farrell and Galvin with all three having Na Fianna connections of some sort, although it remains to be seen if Sherlock is prepared to be involved for a sixth consecutive season.


  Between minor and U21, Farrell had Galvin (St Oliver Plunkett’s/Eoghan Ruadh), Philip McElwee (Na Fianna), Alan “Nipper” McNally (St Anne’s) and Cathal Ó Torna (Na Fianna) as selectors.


  Farrell also had another two Na Fianna men, John Campbell and Pat Naughton, involved in his backroom team. Ó Torna previously acted as GPA secretary during the early part of Farrell’s tenure as the organisation’s chief executive.

“This can help us a lot,” he said, motioning to the animals and then directing his attention straight at 12-year-old Ethan Wesner of Tipton.


  After all, it was Wesner’s idea to bring the stuffed animals to the fire department in the first place.


  One day last year just before his 12th birthday, Wesner was riding in the car with his mother when she asked the boy how he wanted to celebrate turning another year older.


  “He said he didn’t want anything for his birthday,” Andrea Wesner remembered her son saying. “So I said, ‘OK, well, if you don’t want anything, we’ll still have a birthday party, and people will want to bring you something, so is there anything we can do?’”


  That’s when Ethan came up with an idea to ask for stuffed animals that he could turn around and donate to first responders who come into contact with children during tragic situations, like house fires, vehicle accidents or domestic violence situations.


  “We were driving down the road and had been cleaning our house, and we saw in our playroom that we had a lot of toys, mostly mine,” Ethan said, recalling how he came up with the idea. “So I thought that I didn’t need them anymore, so I tried to come up with different ideas to do. And it just came across my mind that I could do this.”


  Not only did Ethan just ask for stuffed animals for his birthday, but he put up flyers and set out donation boxes all over Tipton so that others could donate to his cause too.

Your performance in the Personal Interview (PI) is also very pivotal to the final selection. One should leave no stone unturned if he/she wishes to secure a spot in the final admission list of one’s dream college.

Much more cautious are meteorologists who prefer the evasive  wording "around the clock". We can excuse them - the question of when and how much it is going to rain is very intricate after it became clear at least 500,000 Bulgarians are threatened by water regime.

Un Boeing 737 della Ukraine Airlines e precipitato al suolo dopo il decollo vicino all'aeroporto internazionale di Teheran Imam-Khomeini. A bordo c'erano 176 persone, tra equipaggio e passeggeri. Secondo fonti ufficiali, non ci sono sopravvissuti. Le prime informazioni parlano di un possibile guasto tecnico all'origine dell'incidente. Nelle stesse ore l'Iran aveva avviato l'operazione contro le basi americane in Iraq.      Il volo della Ukraine Airlines era diretto a Kiev. I dati mostrano che il Boeing 737-800 ha raggiunto un'altitudine di 7.925 piedi, circa 2,4 km, e poi e improvvisamente scomparso, circa 3 minuti e 42 secondi dopo il decollo da Teheran, percorsi una decina di chilometri di tragitto. L'aereo e precipitato vicino a Parand, circa 60 chilometri a sud-ovest della capitale iraniana. Immediato l'arrivo dei soccorsi nella zona dello schianto. Il capo della Mezzaluna rossa iraniana ha detto subito ai media locali come fosse "impossibile" per chiunque sopravvivere allo schianto. Poco dopo anche le autorita ucraine hanno confermato la morte di tutti i passeggeri e dell'equipaggio a bordo.      Intanto, la US Federal Aviation Administration ha vietato a tutti i voli commerciali di entrare nello spazio aereo iraniano ed iracheno dopo il lancio di missili contro le basi militari Usa in Iraq, sottolineando "rischio" di "possibili errori di calcolo e di identificazione" in caso di lancio di missili.

Larry stuck the yardstick under the laundromat washer and scraped around. He pulled out a soggy dollar bill, three quarters and some pennies. He went to the next washer and found nothing. At the third, he hit the jackpot--quarters, dimes, nickels and a five dollar bill! The money must have been under these machines for years. He went around to all the washers and dryers in the laundromat, plus the change machine, and had all total, over $15! He had enough food money now for a week.


  Larry was an orphan child, and not much cared for by the people who where supposed to care for him. He had no money, and accidentally discovered the change under the laundromat's machines when he went in late at night to get warm. He saw a dime under the edge of a washer, looked under it and, midst all the dust bunnies and grime, could see a handful of change. In the broom closet of the laundromat he found a yardstick and went to work.


  It was an indelible lesson, one he carried into adulthood, even when he was fairly well off and didn't need to go scavenging for loose change. He carried a coat hanger in the trunk of his car and, if he stopped at an interstate rest stop, if no one was around, he would scrape under the machines to see what he could find -- which was usually well worth the effort, to him, anyway. Once he even found a little purse full of Canadian bills.


  A rest-stop attendant caught him once and told him that the money belonged to the state. "Fat chance," he told the attendant. When the attendant went to the pay phones to call the Highway Patrol, Larry skedaddled.


  After Larry was married, his wife had a fit when she saw what he was up to. "Why are you doing this, Larry?" she asked. "We have plenty of money."


  Larry had no explanation, but could not break himself of the habit.


  However, Larry's wife, knowing more than one way to skin a cat, thought she'd try something. She bought Larry a metal detector for his birthday.


  Larry was excited. He read the directions, put the machine together, and went to the local park. His very first day of "detecting," he found a Lincoln penny and a class ring. He was hooked.


  Over the years, he's found more than $3,900 in coins -- he meticulously keeps track of everything, recording his findings in a ledger -- including an 1887-S American five dollar gold coin, eight gold rings, many sterling silver rings, and several 14K gold class rings. Like a sleuth, he tracks down the owners of the class rings and returns them, if he can, giving him a satisfied feeling. The five dollar gold piece he had set in gold, put on a gold chain, and gave to his wife for her birthday. After all, she was the one who got him started on "detecting."


  To his wife's satisfaction, Larry no longer carries a coat hanger in the trunk of his car.


  Some days, he goes out in the morning, "detects" for a couple of hours, goes home for lunch, then returns in the afternoon. No one gives him grief for "detecting" because there may be one or two other people out there in the park or beach doing the same thing. Under backyard clothes lines, or where clothes lines used to be, are the hot spots. Larry always gets permission before he goes onto someone's property. They may want a slice of the action.


  For the hours spent, and the value accumulated, Larry knows he isn't even earning minimum wage, but he doesn't care. It's free money.


  One man asked him if his machine could detect dollar bills. "Only if it's a silver certificate," he told the man.
