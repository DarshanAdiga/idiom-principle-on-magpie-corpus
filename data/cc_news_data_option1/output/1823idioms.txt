How significant is the upgrade? The Supra launched with 335 horses and 365 pound-feet of torque, and these numbers have increased to 382 horsepower and 368 pound-feet of torque for 2021. In a phone interview with Motor Trend and a few other outfits, Toyota group vice president and general manager, Jack Hollis, responded to these criticisms by saying that it's their job to make vehicles better with each year, not just the Supra. "Vehicles will get better in spaces that are important for them to advance." Referencing the RAV4 Hybrid, he said that current owners could also be upset about the upcoming plug-in variant that gets more power and 90 MPGe fuel economy, the RAV4 Prime. Adding performance is just as important as adding safety and other features across the board for all their other cars. He also added that it would be great if current customers return to buy the 2021 Supra when it hits dealers.

 If you've suffered from anxiety or depression in the past -- and honestly, even if you haven't -- life these days can be pretty disconcerting.
 If you're not working, as many of us aren't, there's only so many times you can switch between reading, gaming, gardening, and attempting to contact the unemployment office before you go completely bananas. Sleeping more than seems reasonable for someone who doesn't do much of anything nowadays? Feeling a distinct lack of productivity?
 Then you'll be at least semi-relieved to hear your reaction to quarantine is entirely normal.
 As humans, we crave connection with others. It's in our nature to explore, interact, socialize. When we aren't able to do these things, there can be an unconscious regression in our personality. We move inward, since we can't move outward.
 You're going through enough right now. We all are. There's nothing wrong with your inability to cook Instagram-worthy dishes. There's no reason you have to pursue a complex or expensive hobby. It's okay to do something mindless, if only to pass the time.
 In the first trimester of my pregnancy, which started late last summer, I suffered from a bout of high-functioning depression. Essentially, that means I spent days upon days in bed and in pain and felt absolutely terrible about it. By the time I came out of my prenatal depression, it was winter. And by the time winter ended, COVID-19 began.
 In many ways, it seems like I haven't lived a normal life in nearly a year. I long to visit my parents and my friends, far too many of whom haven't gotten to meet our newborn. And though I can write from home, I desperately miss the days when I could meet my subjects in-person for story interviews.
 But my husband and I have discovered a few ways to maintain our sanity during these troubling times, and I thought it might be useful to share them.
 (1) Visit the water. I won't pretend that Holland State Park isn't crowded more days than not, but there are plenty of turn-offs near Lake Macatawa where you can get out and smell the sweet, lakeside air. Take the time to download Zillow on your phone, and you can spend at least an hour being amazed by the sheer expense of lakeside houses.
 (2) Pick up a curbside order from your favorite store or restaurant. It's unreal how much pleasure you get when you support local businesses who are struggling to weather the storm. Even on days when you feel utterly useless, you can make a significant difference to someone else.
 (3) Open your windows. Now that the weather has (mostly) warmed up, a decent amount of sunlight can seriously change your perspective. When struggling with your mental health, it's important to remember that you control your environment. A clean living space, some upbeat music, a few open windows and a scented candle can be an even more effective pick-me-up than a good drink.
 (4) Try a podcast instead of television. Free apps like Stitcher can connect you to hundreds of interesting shows -- and, even better, you can walk while listening. It's entertainment and exercise, rolled into one.
 (5) Go see the tulips. We can't celebrate Tulip Time this year, but there's a big perk to being locals. There are literally thousands of beautiful tulips spread throughout the Holland area, and no tourists to avoid. The time is ripe for a tulip photo album.
 When all else fails, I sit on my porch with a good book and try to remind myself of the tattoo I got on my 18th birthday: \"And in time, this too shall pass.\"

This series, just like everything else out there, is currently in a holding pattern while we wait and see what happens on the other side of the global health crisis. Our hope is that new episodes will be ready in 2021 -- for the time being that is the plan, but the health and safety of the entire cast and crew has to be top priority.

The plan for Doug after Jackson graduated high school was to follow in his footsteps, and it just so happened to come at the same time when Gamber got the coaching job at Rend Lake. Gamber reached out to Creel for the coaching position, which Doug felt spoke very highly of Gamber’s character.
 According to Creel, Gamber already possesses all of the tools to be a great coach for the Warriors. His role as an assistant coach comes with no strings attached because at this point of Creel’s coaching career, he’s not looking to move up in the coaching ranks. In fact, it’s a blessing for Creel to have some of the pressure as head coach removed from his shoulders to focus on what he loves.

Today is your last chance to get a freebie on PS4, Xbox One, and PC. More specifically, today is the last day you can grab _Pac-Man Championship Edition 2_ on the house, courtesy of Bandai Namco. After today, the game will -- on all platforms -- will return to its normal price of $13. The game, which was made free to encourage gamers to stay home during the coronavirus pandemic, has been 100 percent free since late last month.
 While the game will return to its normal, full price tomorrow, if you download it now, not only do you get to play the game for free, but you get to keep it. In other words, this is not a free trial or a free demo. It's a free download. Once the game is downloaded, it's yours to play as much or as little as you want.
 "People around the globe are doing their part to change their life and workstyles in order to battle the COVID-19 pandemic," said an official statement that accompanied the original announcement. "Here at Bandai Namco Entertainment, we have put into action initiatives to support and safeguard the health of our employees, their families, and friends, as well as our customers, vendors, and our communities... As such, we will be sending our beloved goodwill ambassador, Pac-Man, into everyone's homes by making _Pac-Man Championship Edition 2_ available for free."
 In addition to PC, PS4, and Xbox One, the game is also available on Nintendo Switch, however, for whatever reason, it was never made free on the Nintendo platform.

  _Pac-Man_ _Championship Edition 2_ debuted back in 2016 via Bandai Namco and one of its internal studios. Upon release, the game was received warmly by consumers and critics alike, garnering a Metacritic score that ranged from 77 to 80, depending on the platform. Below, you can read more about the title:
 "Featuring eye-popping 3D graphics and funky visuals, the latest version of the classic game takes chomping and chasing through mazes to a whole new level," reads an official blurb about the title. "Make up to four ghost trains for maximum chompage! New modes include Score Attack and an Adventure Mode with fast fleeing fruit, big bad bosses, ridiculous remixed rules, and more!"

New showrunners often come on board projects with a passion for creating new avenues and opportunities for characters -- they're not setting out to change the show from what it was in the early going. _When Calls the Heart_ is still the same series that it's always been, and we think that season 8 will probably pick up not that long after the events of the season 7 finale.

When it came to Jordan and the Bulls, the documentary reveals, when the Pistons realized they were simply outmatched by Jordan’s superior talent and that of the Bulls as a whole, they adopted a win-at-all cost approach that involved Jordan didn’t get off the ground, that every time he came down the lane he would know he was subject to injury, that he would be tackled, thrown down, and man-handled. And, while the Piston players called these the Jordan rules, this treatment wasn’t just reserved for Jordan. We see Bad Boy James Edwards throwing elbows and Rick Mahorn advising teammates that if they’re going to foul, it might as well be as hard and violent as possible. At one point, we see Dennis Rodman bear hug Scottie Pippen as he comes down with a rebound and then, after Pippen is already out of bounds and off-balance, push him in the back into a row of seats.

Bailey’s district. They are good, small rural hospitals but with few, if any, ICU beds and certainly not capable of handling a massive coronavirus and flu epidemic that Dr. Fauci and other scientists have predicted could very well happen this fall and winter. People will die unnecessarily if this happens.
 The ICU beds in Mount Vernon and Evansville will be full and every ventilator in use. Where will the people of southeastern Illinois go to receive life- saving care? How many long months will it take for jobs to return if this pandemic comes back with double the force?
