Last week, as the sports world came to a screeching halt (except the NFL offseason), many fans were left wondering what to do.
 I thought now would be a perfect time to bring the show back to the radio for the first time in almost 15 years. All of the audio on the cassette tapes sound like they were recorded yesterday.
 With the help of Adrian Broaddus and Sal Montes, we recently launched the “Don Haskins Hour” weekdays at 6 p.m. on 600 ESPN El Paso.
 Each day, we play a different hour of the program in its entirety along with a featured guest.
 A recent show included former WAC and Sun Belt Commissioner Karl Benson, former Texas Western College star and Hall of Fame coach Nolan Richardson, former UTEP women’s basketball head coach Keitha Adams and Dan Wetzel, the author of “Glory Road,” Haskins’ autobiography.
 Former UTEP greats like Fred Reynolds and Wayne “Soup” Campbell have also been on the show.
 An interview with Dick Vitale will be replayed on March 31.
 Over the next six weeks, we will feature Bobby Knight, Tim Floyd, Norm Ellenberger, Mike Krzyzewski, Jim Forbes, Greg Foster, Don Maynard, Billy Gillispie, Jon Teicher and many more.
 After every “Don Haskins Hour,” the original broadcast is available on demand via the 600 ESPN El Paso Podcast. I hope you will enjoy these as much as I did then – and even more now.

 Roberts suggested the board might be better served by a class on parliamentary procedure, which had also been discussed at the previous meeting.
 “McGhee said, “As chair, I believe we need to invest more at looking at improving our schools, so that we will have a better understanding to move forward on some of the issues we have.”
 Asked Roberts, “What issues are those?”
 Answered McGhee, “As you know, we have a lot of parents that have concerns in reference to students and what have you.”
 Replied Roberts, “I actually don’t know that, but I do know there are a lot of issues brought to light in our open meetings that are not issues that rise to the level of board action.
 “We have issues in any organization of this size that need to go through the teacher, the principal, the Central Office and the superintendent before they reach the board. We tried to clarify that, without success.”
 Said Beavers, “In light of how much time these children are missing from school, I think we all should all be concerned. And also, when that last parent was here (during the last meeting), with the issue of her child failing, I think that is something we all need to be concerned about.

Coloring Easter eggs is a time-honored tradition passed down from generation to generation. Easter eggs symbolize rebirth, which fits in well with both religious and seasonal celebrations.
 While there are many kits on the market that enable people to easily color eggs, there also are plenty of all-natural foodstuffs, like fruits, vegetables, herbs, and spices, that can get the job done just as effectively. For those who plan to eat the eggs afterward, natural dyes may be preferable to dyes from kits.
 Below are a few tried and true methods for producing brilliantly hued eggs with items from the kitchen, courtesy of The Spruce and Martha Stewart.
 Beautiful blues
 Give chicken eggs a beautiful robin egg shade with red cabbage. Simply shred one cup of red cabbage into a pot. Bring the cabbage and roughly 4 cups water and 1 tablespoon salt to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 15 minutes. Let the broth cool. Strain out the cabbage and stir in 2 tablespoons of distilled white vinegar. Let the eggs sit in the dye for the desired duration to achieve light to dark blue eggs.
 Perky pinks
 Use beets to create pink and red eggs. Take 1 or 2 beets and roughly chop them. Combine with 4 cups water and 1 tablespoon of salt in a saucepan. Bring it to a boil, then reduce and simmer for 30 minutes. Strain the mixture and allow to cool. Add 2 tablespoons of vinegar. Use the solution for red and pink eggs.
 Happy yellows
 Cast a sunny glow on eggs with a common household spice and some tasty carrots. Turmeric is touted for its anti-inflammatory benefits, but it also makes a great dye. Bring 1 tablespoon of turmeric, 3 to 4 sliced carrots, 1 tablespoon salt, and 4 cups of water to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 15 minutes. Let cool, strain and stir in 2 tablespoons distilled white vinegar. Use the dye for a lovely yellow shade.
 Turn to all natural items for safe and easily dyed Easter eggs.

 The ship is currently about eight miles off the west coast of Panama, according to the Panamanian government. Holland America said it plans to transfer healthy passengers from Zaandam to the Rotterdam ship, a sister ship, following CDC protocols. The ships exchanged medical supplies Thursday evening.
 "Only those who have not been ill will be moved, and health screenings will be conducted before transferring," the company said. Once onboard the Rotterdam, guests will remain inside their rooms until disembarking.
 The Panama Canal announced Friday on Twitter the Zaandam will not be able to use the canal to get to Florida.
 "If a vessel has individuals who have tested positive for Covid-19 on board, it cannot make any port operations or transit the canal," said the statement.

“Unfortunately, we’re having major problems moving goods from Europe right now because there are so few flights available. They’re charging exorbitant rates. If we don’t find a solution in the next days, we will have lost (roughly $97,000) in online business this quarter,” Barraza said.
 Barraza imports wine from France, Italy and Spain.
 “I just ordered eight new wines from France and Italy that are arriving in April. I hope I will have customers to sell them to,” he said.

 She’s offered baked goods for takeout and delivery, and created ‘Quarantine Survival Kits’ that were a hit with customers. They included cupcakes, cookies and a sugar cookie decorated like a roll of toilet paper.
 “Everything changes in a matter of hours. I know eventually I’ll have to close because we’ll run out of materials, the state will shut us down or someone will get sick. It’s incredibly scary.”
 Despite the chaos and uncertainty, Trejo said the borderland community has been supportive.
 “Everyone has been recommending places and the local bloggers have worked non- stop to help promote those of us who are still up and running,” she said. “It’s bittersweet.”

A foodie with friends in delicious places, Arlan asked Denver restauranteurs if he could distribute food that had not been served at the end of the day and was slated for disposal. What began with a station wagon and a few restaurants has grown to a fleet of refrigerated delivery trucks and mobile food markets, a warehouse, and 160 partners at every level of the food production food chain. Since inception, We Don’t Waste has served 100 million servings of food, kept 25 million pounds of food out of the landfill, and conserved 630 million gallons of water that would have been wasted.

BOSTON -- With one of the nation's hottest coronavirus zones just 200 miles south on Interstate 95 in New York City, Gov. Charlie Baker on Friday urged people who are thinking about traveling to Massachusetts to reconsider, and said that anyone arriving to the state through an airport or train station will be advised to self-quarantine for 14 days.
 "We're asking that folks considering travel to Massachusetts for whatever reason, do not travel to our communities, especially if you have symptoms," Baker said at his Friday morning press conference.
 The new guidance from Baker follows a recommendation from the White House coronavirus task force on Tuesday that anyone who has left New York or who has passed through New York City on their way somewhere else self-quarantine for two weeks.
 Baker on Friday also shot down President Donald Trump's suggestion that he would like to see the economy of the United States reopen for business by Easter Sunday, which arrives in two weeks on April 12.
 "Yeah, no. We're not going to be up and running by Easter. No," the governor said to end his daily briefing.
 The contradiction of the president by Baker was just the latest expression of frustration from the governor with the federal government's coronavirus response, which included an op-ed by Baker, a Republican, and New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat, published in the New York Times pleading for more support.
 Health and Human Services Secretary Marylou Sudders said the Trump administration had come through with approvals for some of the state's Medicaid waiver requests to "fast-track MassHealth enrollments," enroll out- of-state providers, and to allow providers to be reimbursed for care delivered in alternative settings like tents or congregate care facilities. More approvals from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to ease restrictions on the delivery of care are expected by the end of the day, Sudders said.
 Baker said anyone traveling through Logan International Airport, Worcester Airport, South Station or one of the state's other transit hubs will be given fliers requesting that they self-quarantine for 14 days. The state will also be putting messages on electronic highway billboards along the Turnpike and putting notices at visitor centers advising travelers to self-isolate.
 "I would call it at this point instruction and advisory. There is no enforcement mechanism," Baker said.
 Asked if he had considered taking the temperature of people entering the state from New York or elsewhere, Baker said, "The answer at this point is we are engaged in discussions with a lot of people about what we can and cannot do, OK. And there are plenty of legal and constitutional issues involved in this."
 The self-quarantine advisory was one of several updates Baker provided Friday morning as the state neared the end of nearly three weeks under a declared state of emergency.
 Since Baker declared the public health emergency on March 10, the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Massachusetts has climbed from 41 to 2,417, with 219 hospitalizations and 25 deaths attributed to the disease.
 Before the press conference, the Baker administration announced that he had reached agreement with Democratic leaders in the Legislature to postpone the income tax filing deadline from April 15 to July 15, consistent with a step taken by the Internal Revenue Service last week for federal tax returns.
 The governor also announced a new partnership between the state and Buoy Health, a Massachusetts-based e-health company that utilizes artificial intelligence to match people with the health services they need.
 The online tool will be available for free to Massachusetts residents at buoy.com/mass where residents can complete a risk assessment interview to screen for symptoms of COVID-19 based on Department of Public Health and Centers for Disease Control guidance, and be connected with the appropriate medical care.
 Dr. Andrew Le, the CEO of Buoy Health, said the company was created at Harvard University in 2013 and has had 7.5 million users access medical care through its program.
 To continue to meet the demand for clinical care, Health and Human Services Secretary Marylou Sudders said a public health order had been issued expanding the scope of practice for 13,642 advanced practice nurses to allow many with more than two years experience to write prescriptions without doctor supervision.
 The order is similar to a bill passed by the Senate Thursday to address the shortage of health care workers by giving nurses more latitude to practice outside the supervision of an overseeing physician. Despite support in the Senate, House leaders said they didn't think it was an appropriate action for the Legislature to take, and House Majority Leader Ron Mariano said Baker had the authority to do it on his own if necessary.
 Sudders also formally announced an agreement that the governor teased on Thursday between the state and deans of various medical schools in Massachusetts to allow the early graduation of qualified fourth-year students from schools like Boston University School of Medicine, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Tufts University School of Medicine and Harvard Medical School.
 Those students entering internships, residencies and fellowships at board- certified health facilities in Massachusetts will be given emergency 90-day licenses to begin practicing medicine immediately before those programs begin this summer.
 "The COVID-19 public heath emergency has put a tremendous demand, as you know, on our health care system, and access to health care workers," Sudders said.
 The need for workers is particularly acute in the respiratory therapy and public health nursing fields, Sudders said, and the state has launched a portal to be coordinated by the Massachusetts Medical Society for volunteers with professional health backgrounds to sign up and be matched where their expertise can be used.

"Pronto, Silvia?": la voce è rotta dall'emozione, nel cuore e nella testa i tanti, tantissimi ricordi che, uno dopo l'altro, si fanno largo, perché solo pochi giorni prima suo papà se ne è andato per sempre. Era stato ricoverato in ospedale, positivo al Coronavirus, ma, purtroppo, non c'è l'ha fatta. 76 anni quest'anno, Roberto Simonin abitava a Castano Primo con la moglie Fiorenza; pensionato, dopo una vita intera dedicata alla famiglia ed al lavoro, due figlie (Silvia e Stefania) era una persona conosciuta e ben voluta, un castanese che, oggi, lascia un enorme vuoto nella comunità intera. "Papà ci mancherà tanto - dice, appunto, Silvia - Tutto è cominciato il 5 marzo scorso con la febbre; inizialmente abbiamo pensato ad una normale influenza, però con il passare dei giorni la temperatura corporea non diminuiva, nemmeno con i medicinali e l'antibiotico. Avevamo capito che poteva esserci qualcosa di strano, così ci siamo attivati contattando gli specifici numeri per quanto concerne il COVID-19. Chiamavamo, ci chiedevano che sintomi avesse e, in particolar modo, se faceva fatica a respirare, ma visto che questa problematica non era riscontrata, allora ci spiegavano di proseguire con le cure che stavamo già facendo". Fino al 13 marzo quando Silvia e la mamma Fiorenza, vedendo che Roberto non migliorava, senza aspettare altro tempo, l'hanno portato in ospedale. "Ci siamo messi ogni protezione possibile - continua la figlia - L'ho caricato in macchina e siamo andato a Legnano, dove è stata l'ultima volta che l'ho visto. Papà, infatti, confermata la positività al Coronavirus, dal nosocomio legnanese è stato, poi, trasferito a Busto Arsizio, dove l'hanno intubato". Una decina di giorni circa in terapia intensiva, faceva fatica a respirare, fino a che sembrava che le cose si stessero stabilizzando, tanto che, addirittura, era stato estubato, mettendogli il casco per la respirazione. "Al momento di risvegliarlo, lui ha risposto in maniera positiva - spiega Silvia - Ricordava di essere in ospedale e che l'avevo portato io, anzi al personale sanitario ha domandato se fossi lì. C'erano, insomma, segnali che potesse farcela, però, purtroppo, mercoledì (25 marzo) è subentrato un problema neurologico e se ne è andato per sempre". Volato via, senza poter nemmeno dare un ultimo saluto alla sua amata famiglia; senza poter stingere la mano alla moglie ed alle due figlie. "I medici o gli infermieri ci contattavano praticamente ogni giorno, al pomeriggio, per farci sapere come stava - ribadisce -Voglio davvero ringraziarli uno per uno per l'amore e l'affetto con i quali l'hanno accudito durante il periodo di ricovero. Persone eccezionali, veri e propri angeli che hanno fatto il possibile per farci sentire meno la vicinanza. Non è facile; non lo è stato per mia mamma che non ha potuto stare accanto a suo marito; non lo è stato per noi, che potevamo avere informazioni solo attraverso un telefono. E anche non poter celebrare il funerale, è qualcosa che ti stringe il cuore". Silvia, comunque, sa che suo papà da lassù continuerà a vigilare ed a proteggere tutti i suoi cari. "Era una persona che amava la natura e gli animali - conclude - Un grande lavoratore e un punto di riferimento. Ci mancherà tantissimo. Permettetemi, infine, di ripetere quel messaggio che, ormai da settimane ci stanno dicendo, state a casa; è fondamentale per la nostra salute e per quella dei nostri familiari, parenti ed amici".

Don Cuco’s signage may have garnered some giggles for its Chuco-style sign, but it is seriously representative of the measures restaurants have had to take to survive.
 “We have gone down in sales. We had to cut back on hours of operation for now. We’ve also let employees take some time off if they’re uncomfortable working during this time,” Don Cuco’s district manager Linda Ortega said.
 The restaurant, a past winner of El Paso Inc.’s Best of the Best Tacos, has 10 locations citywide that are all offering takeout and delivery.
 Customers honk twice and an employee comes out to their vehicle to take their order. Customers can also call ahead of time to pick up orders. Delivery is available via the smartphone app, Favor.
 Ortega said the company updates their Facebook page regularly to let the public know of any business changes.
 Locally owned businesses have been hit especially hard, particularly as they struggle to keep up with the changing emergency orders. On March 17, the city and county enacted an emergency order requiring all bars and clubs in the city to close and restaurants to limit their capacity to 50%. Three days later, they amended the directive, ordering all restaurants to close their dining areas and operate strictly under drive-through, pickup and delivery services.
 And on March 24, the city and county issued a “stay home, work safe” order, directing the public to remain at their residence except to obtain essential services. Among other things, the order allows the public to go out for groceries, as well as food through the drive-through or pickup services.
 Even so, area restaurateurs are bracing for a greater decline in business.
 Ricardo Barraza, owner of Wine Attitude Wine Bar in West El Paso, said his small business has taken a financial hit. Over the last two weeks, he’s hosted wine sales hoping to regain business.
