So I thought they showed great maturity and a great approach to practice today. Also it was a good give and take; we, of course, believe that we're good on both sides of the ball, and so what you saw out there today was some nice-looking plays from the offense — big plays, nice runs, a few good deep passes — and then you saw the defense making some plays as well. And it was a really good give and take, and I think that's what gonna make us better, if we can learn how to compete against each other out here like that, I think we'll be tough to handle."

La première est celle de la Foncière immobilière bordelaise (FIB), fonds d'investissement spécialisé dans l'immobilier commercial de l'homme d'affaires Michel Ohayon, qui a notamment acquis 22 franchises Galeries Lafayette en régions en 2018.
 Elle a la préférence du comité social et économique (CSE) et de l'intersyndicale CFDT-CGT-FO et compte reprendre 511 magasins et 2.619 salariés, sur les 634 magasins et 3.146 salariés de l'entreprise, dont 438 au siège à Roubaix.
 "Il y a moins de casse", souligne Omar Rahni, représentant CGT au CSE. "Et puis, comment soutenir une équipe dirigeante qui coule la boîte, la met en redressement, bénéficie des aides de l'Etat, voit l'ardoise effacée et en profite pour fermer des magasins et licencier?".
 Cette deuxième offre est portée notamment par l'actuel PDG de l'entreprise, Joannes Soënen, et trois fonds déjà actionnaires (GoldenTree, CVC et Farallon), soutenus par le syndicat maison majoritaire (38%) Unis pour agir ensemble (UPAE).
 Elle prévoit de garder 2.520 emplois et de reprendre 446 magasins, dont 43 seront sous l'enseigne de prêt-à-porter féminin de la galaxie Mulliez, Grain de malice.
 Selon Van Minh Nguyen, élu UPAE au CSE, ce projet est "plus pérenne". "L'offre reprend moins de magasins mais est plus en adéquation par rapport au marché actuel du textile, en difficulté", estime-t-il.
 Le 24 juillet, à l'issue de l'audience, tendue, devant le tribunal de commerce, M. Soënen avait assuré avoir "un plan bien identifié, une feuille de route claire" "pour que Camaïeu puisse se dynamiser pour les dix prochaines années".
 La nouvelle direction s'associerait au logisticien nordiste Log's, qui intègrerait les 153 salariés de l'entrepôt de Roubaix et investirait 25 M EUR pour en créer un nouveau, selon son PDG Franck Gimomprez. L'intersyndicale de Camaïeu craint que la société ne se sépare à terme du prestataire actuel Dispéo, qui emploie plus d'une centaine de personnes à Hem pour les commandes internet.
 ##  Très serré
 Interrogés par l'AFP, les différentes parties n'ont fait aucun pronostic, assurant que chaque offre avait 50% de chance de l'emporter. Les différents membres du tribunal étaient eux-mêmes partagés lors de l'audience.
 Fondée en 1984, Camaïeu a été placée en redressement judiciaire le 26 mai, "lourdement impactée par la crise sanitaire et faute d'un prêt garanti par l'Etat (PGE) qui lui aurait permis de surmonter" cette situation, selon une source proche de la direction.
 Début mars, "l'entreprise avait commencé à mettre en œuvre son plan de transformation et un accord de financement était sur le point d'être conclu avec les actionnaires et les banques".
 Mais "la crise sanitaire a obligé le groupe à fermer brutalement plus de 800 magasins dans le monde", entraînant un "manque à gagner de 162 millions d'euros", précise cette source.
 L'intersyndicale et des syndicats des filiales belge et luxembourgeoise réclament eux des enquêtes, disant avoir la "profonde conviction" que "dès le mois de mars, tout était organisé" pour "passer par une faillite et non par un plan social négocié". Ce que la direction réfute.
 Selon l'avocat de la FIB, Olivier Pardo, l'ordonnance du 20 mai relative aux difficultés des entreprises dues à l'épidémie du coronavirus, qui assouplit les règles pour qu'un dirigeant puisse déposer une offre de reprise de sa propre entreprise, ne peut pas s'appliquer pour Camaïeu, car les "difficultés ne sont pas liées au Covid mais antérieures, et l'offre de la FIB est mieux- disante".
 "Ce serait aller contre la loi d'autoriser cette offre", avance-t-il.
 Fin 2018, la société avait été reprise par ses créanciers après une procédure de sauvegarde. En 2016, elle avait déjà négocié avec ses créanciers pour que la moitié de sa dette, qui s'élevait alors à un milliard d'euros, soit convertie en actions.

Bruce Rollinson was in his Mater Dei office when offensive coordinator Dave Money walked in the room requesting his presence at the quarterback academy his school was hosting.
 In particular, it was to check out one player.
 “You gotta come watch this kid,” Money said.
 But it wasn’t to the football field that Money wanted to take his boss. Instead, Rollinson accompanied Money to the Mater Dei football conference room, where a group of middle school quarterbacks were learning and discussing how to break down certain coverages.
 On the chalkboard, diagraming Cover 2, Cover 3 and Cover 0 defenses, was JT Daniels, barely a teenager at the time. Rollinson couldn’t believe his eyes. He sat in the back of the room astonished at what he was witnessing. This is a head coach who has seen every starting quarterback he coached, except one, earn a Division 1 scholarship since 1989. Rollinson, who will enter his 32nd football season (whenever that may be) at Mater Dei in Santa Ana, California, said this moment was among the most memorable he's witnessed.
 “You try to find kids like this,” Rollinson said. “I've got a million of them that can throw it from here to the next city, but they're not worth a crap mentally.”
 This marked the moment that Rollinson knew Mater Dei had a special player in the pipeline.

 This latest spike is statistically similar to the one in July.
 County personnel were more effective in contact tracing than the state, Leo said.
 “Keep in mind that many counties never did any local work and turned it all over to the state from day one, but our staff did a tremendous job since February,” he said. “The state hired — and had to rapidly train — 30 additional workers to cover the state. Unfortunately, things are presently quite dead in the water as the state officials are 10-14 days behind in contacting the index positive patients, let alone successfully completing meaningful contact tracing.”

A loophole allowed the sellers of the property to "essentially lease the public land that sits under the seawall" for a one-time cost of $61,400. Hawaii's Department of Land and Natural Resources gave the green light for the seawall to remain standing for another half-century, according to ProPublica.

Poverty is an evil that our government has chosen to ignore, and its eradication would free hundreds of thousands of Louisiana citizens from the stress of extreme financial struggle. In addition, UBI would create jobs, improve childhood outcomes, ease inequalities and strengthen our communities.
 Though he has garnered the support of Yang, Pierce, like many progressives, has been no favorite of the Democratic Party. He represents a threat to the apathy and corruption that has become second nature to politicians on both sides of the aisle, particularly when it comes to the monied interests that clog our government.
 While Sen. Cassidy perhaps feels he has the agency to ignore the economic distress of his constituency because of the over $2.5 million conservative Political Action Committees have raised for his reelection, Pierce is 100% voter funded and therefore wholly accountable to his supporters.
 Pierce’s candidacy is a breath of fresh air to a political climate that has been starved of empathy and energy. The Democratic Party’s refusal to embrace his candidacy -- and those of other insurgent voices -- is emblematic of an institution motivated by money instead of public service.
 Yes, democratic leadership has shortchanged the public by not amplifying these candidates, but they have also made a poor tactical choice. In a time so rich with despair, Louisiana citizens do not yearn for politicians that will toe the line with half measures, but rather a leader brave enough to fight for the future they and their children deserve.
 Antoine Pierce is that leader. This November, a storm awaits Sen. Cassidy.
