STOCKHOLM (AP) — American poet Louise Glück won the Nobel Prize in Literature on Thursday for her "candid and uncompromising" work, which looks unflinchingly and with biting humor at loss and trauma, especially in family life.
 She joins a handful of American poets who have received the prize, which has been dominated by novelists since the first award in 1901. She is also one of the few women honored — the 16th female Nobel Literature laureate.
 Glück, who shuns most publicity, told Sweden's TT news agency from her home in Cambridge, Massachusetts, that her phone was ringing off the hook, and she was struggling to express her feelings about the award.

A news agency has apologised to the Duke and Duchess of Sussex after drones were allegedly used to take pictures of their son Archie, the couple’s lawyer has said.
 The couple launched legal action in Los Angeles in July claiming an individual had photographed Archie, then 14 months old, at their home during lockdown.
 The couple claimed the pictures were an invasion of privacy.
 In a statement on Thursday their lawyer Michael Kump, of Kinsella Weitzman Iser Kump LLP, said the agency responsible, X17, had apologised and agreed a “reimbursement of legal fees”.
 He added: “Over the summer, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex took action against intrusive and illegal paparazzi photos taken of their family at a private residence.
 “Today, the agency responsible for those photos — X17 — apologised and agreed to a permanent injunction and reimbursement of legal fees.
 “This is a successful outcome.
 “All families have a right, protected by law, to feel safe and secure at home.”
 Court documents from the Los Angeles County Superior Court said that the photos were of Archie and Meghan’s mother Doria Ragland.
 X17 has also agreed to turn over the photos to the family, destroy any copies in its archives or databases and never again traffic in any photos of the couple or their son taken by drone, zoom or telephoto lenses “in any private residence or the surrounding private grounds”.
 In their lawsuit the Duke and Duchess had claimed they lived “unmolested” in North Saanich, Canada, for six weeks before the media published their new location, leading to “up to 40 paparazzi and media organisations descending on this peaceful community from hundreds of miles away”.
 Their move to Los Angeles earlier this year to the “gated community at the generosity of a friend” – thought to be the entertainment tycoon Tyler Perry – was similarly exposed, the couple said, resulting in further distress.
 Drones have been flown 20ft above their house as often as three times a day, according to the lawsuit, while some of the pictures of Archie have been sold.
 Helicopters have also flown over the residence as early as 5.30am and as late as 7pm, the legal papers say, which had the effect of “waking neighbours and their son, day after day”.
 Holes were also cut into the security fence by photographers, the lawsuit states.
 The lawsuit was prompted by “the relentless and quite frankly shocking efforts of the tabloid media” to “profit from serial intrusions” on Archie’s privacy, the lawsuit sates. The former royal couple want to do what is “necessary to protect their children from this manufactured feeding frenzy”.
 The lawsuit cites California’s privacy laws, which make photographing or filming anyone in their homes by use of drone or telephoto lenses illegal.
 Because Harry and Meghan do not know who took the pictures, the lawsuit initially targeted unnamed defendants, which allowed the couple to pursue, through subpoenas, anyone selling the images.
 Harry and Meghan – who departed the royal family in March, saying they wanted a more private life – “seek no special treatment whatsoever” and only want the right to privacy.
 The lawsuit is the latest example of the couple’s war against what they describe as an intrusive tabloid media.
 Meghan is suing Associated Newspapers, publisher of the two titles Mail on Sunday and MailOnline, over articles which featured parts of a “private and confidential” letter from the duchess to her estranged father, Thomas Markle.

BOSSIER CITY, La. - Another year of National Night Out events is in the books in Bossier Parish.
 There were a total of eight parties held. They were in River Ridge Subdivision in Benton, Dogwood Park in Haughton, Old Green Acres in Bossier City, Rosedale Subdivision, Shady Grove Subdivision in Bossier City, Sterling Ranch in Bossier Parish, River Walk in Bossier Parish, and The Crossing at Wemple in Bossier Parish.
 “Despite the low number of block parties, we usually have, I think the night was a success,” said Sheriff Julian Whittington.
 Tuesday night, Whittington and deputies with the Bossier Sheriff’s Office attended the block parties.
 “I would like to say thank you to the neighborhoods in the parish and those in the city that held block parties,” Sheriff Whittington said. “We were able to get out and get to know the residents of our great parish and city made the night a huge success in my book.”

“Now we have the Save in Savanah,” O’Brien quipped.          Without power, the pilots could not use their navigational aids, and had to rely on visibility, which was not always there. They lost view of the airport at 1,500 feet, Downs said. At the last minute, the runway appears.          “We looked at each other and kind of had a smile on our face. Hey. This is going to be OK,” he said.          Experts in the webinar said the way the drama unfolded demonstrates everything you want in a cockpit team.          “What we see here is a flawless execution of emergency response,” said Richard McSpadden, executive director of the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association Safety Foundation. “It’s just a remarkable example of crew coordination and airmanship.”          Now back to that fuel additive and the fueling mistake. It turns out that diesel trucks are required to add Diesel Exhuast Fluid or DEF to reduce their pollution emissions. It’s a colorless, odorless liquid that is often stored in smaller containers. Planes like the Citation 2 require another fuel additive called Prist that prevents ice crystals at high altitudes.          It’s a colorless, odorless liquid often stored in smaller containers. On May 9, at Punta Gorda airport, a fueling technician who was later fired mixed the two, thinking they were both Prist. He added the mixture to the fuel for two Air Trek planes that day. Both planes never moved again, without being towed. The second plane only lost one engine and also made an emergency landing.          After settling an insurance dispute with Air Trek, Punta Gorda Airport issued congratulations to the two pilots.          “These pilots showed outstanding airmanship, life-saving responsiveness, and grace under pressure,” Airport CEO James Parish said in a statement.          Since the big mistake, the airport has changed its storage protocols so that DEF is stored, locked and off-site. The Prist, also called FSII, is stored separately with different locks and different key rings. Personnel get more training, and supplies of DEF and FSII are logged.          That’s not enough for pilot organizations, however. They have been petitioning the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for years to make airport trucks exempt from the DEF requirements, saying these trucks are not as polluting as the typical truck traveling over highways. So far, they have not been successful in getting this changed.          Reached for comment, Punta Gorda Airport Commissioner Rob Hancik said when he ran a small airport in Missouri, he required all jet fuel to have the Prist premixed, even for jets that didn’t need it. That meant no mixing at the airport. Asked if he has pressured Punta Gorda management to follow this protocol, Hancik said, “Next question.”          So after the plane landed, it just sat there, which prompted the nervous passenger to ask why they weren’t taxiing on the runway, Downs recalled.          “Because we lost both engines,” one of the medical technicians told her.          That earned the pilots their biggest fan.          “I still don’t like to fly in small planes,” Downs, “but I would fly with you guys anywhere.”

A third GOP senator who was in contact with one of the other two is also now positive and in isolation.

Rookie Justin Herbert will be the Los Angeles Chargers' starting quarterback going forward, coach Anthony Lynn announced Thursday.                     Lynn confirmed that Herbert will get the nod for the Chargers (1-3) in Monday's road game against the New Orleans Saints (2-2) even if veteran Tyrod Taylor is healthy and active.                     Taylor, 31, started Los Angeles' 16-13 win over Cincinnati in the season opener and was poised to do the same against Kansas City in Week 2, but he sustained a punctured lung from a painkilling injection administered by a team doctor.                     Herbert, who was the sixth overall pick of the 2020 NFL Draft, came on and completed 22 of 33 passes for 311 yards with a touchdown against the Chiefs. The 22-year-old Herbert threw for a season-high 330 yards the following week against Carolina and tossed three touchdown passes in a 38-31 setback at Tampa Bay on Sunday.                     A four-year starter at Oregon, Herbert threw for 10,541 yards and 95 touchdowns against just 23 interceptions, including 3,471 yards, 32 touchdowns and six picks as a senior in 2019.                     --Field Level Media

However, Burgandine argued that if contacts were communications, that would render the second part of the statute redundant. Instead, the General Assembly had to intend contacts to be narrower, requiring physical closeness.
 “The concern is things that have physical proximity to the meeting,” said Burgandine’s lawyer, Jessica Sommer, to the appeals panel during oral argument. “Some sort of meeting or an attempt to meet. Maybe it’s repeatedly going to the person’s place of business or not approaching them but making your presence known to the person.”
 "Are there any communications that would not also fall within contacts?" Dunn asked the attorney general's office.
 "Quite frankly, I could not think of an actual communication that wouldn't also qualify as a contact," Marixa Frias responded.
 The panel rejected Burgandine's argument about the legal provision, noting that while “approaching” someone implied proximity, “surveilling” them did not necessarily follow suit. Furthermore, in studying the 1999 legislative session when the law changed, the court learned that the approach-contact-surveil framework had no connection to how close a stalker was to his victim.
 “And though Burgandine asserts that we should construe ‘contacts’ to imply ‘some sort of physical proximity' requirement, he doesn’t say what that means or how a defendant could reasonably know what conduct is prohibited,” Dunn explained. “Nor does he explain how prosecutors or courts would apply such an amorphous requirement.”
 Sommer took issue with the suggestion that there should be no attempt to define what acts would be against the law if, in fact, contacts were limited in nature. "I think coming up with a definition is what this court's job is," she argued.
 The case is _People v. Burgandine._

When considering the elements that go into studying abroad (possible scholarships, tuition, languages, adaptation to different cultures, housing), it looks like a bargain to study in Venezuela; you have certain comforts that only a few would have after emigrating, and even the cost itself is notoriously lower when compared to those in America. Yet most of the people my age that I know wonder if we’re settling for living comfortably just because we’re in our home country, while knowing that things are so eroded in parts of Venezuela that the question turns into pain, particularly now that all universities have raised their tuitions and a semester can cost up to a thousand dollars, which makes it unaffordable to most.

This was unfortunate for my father. Fresh out of Ole Miss, where he was editor of the Mississippian and elected to the Hall of Fame, my father wanted to expand the company. But his father refused to borrow.
 As a result, we missed out on one of the greatest investment opportunities in history. My father decided to leave Mississippi and be a big city editor. He ended up an editor of the Houston Chronicle, which at the time had the largest circulation in the South. And that is how I spent my childhood in the saddle of a horse.
 Once in Texas, my father got bit by the horse bug bad. Every weekend, our family was going to a horse show. My sister became one of the best teenage Western riders in the state. You couldn’t fit all the trophies in her room. She barrel raced in the Astrodome.
 Every year in March, my parents would take us out of school for a week and we would trail ride 20 or 30 miles a day, culminating in the huge downtown Houston livestock parade.
 You should have seen the battle royales between by father and school administrators who refused to allow excused absences. For a week, we got zeroes and had to simply work that much harder at our schoolwork the rest of the year.
 The trail rides were something. About 200 horses. We would camp at night in VFW campgrounds and have big barbecues and dances every night. That’s where I got up enough courage to ask the first girl to dance. I could do a mean two- step by age 12.
 Summer camp was horse camp. We rode from sunup to sundown in the Texas hill country near Wimberly. I could ride bareback as naturally as walk down the street.
 My father founded a local stable a mile from our neighborhood. I spent countless hours scooping up horse manure and building stalls. We boarded 30 or so horses and had endless neighborhood horse shows.
 If my father hitched up the trailer and headed to a horse auction, you could be sure he was going to come back with the trailer full. He would then find a buyer in our neighborhood and sign them up to board at our stable.
 He bought me a horse named Bullet, half Quarter Horse, half Thoroughbreed. Bullet was trained as a polo pony and he was high strung as hell.
 I’ve been kicked in the head, bitten in the neck, bucked off, broken ribs. It’s a miracle I survived. And I’m allergic to grass pollen, which a horse’s coat is full of.
 Apparently, my father never noticed my severe allergic reaction around horses, or my many injuries, or my indentured servitude as a horse manure shoveller. I never thought to object. It’s what our family did, so I just went along for the ride. What I really loved was motorcycles. And my father. He was simply an amazing man. You couldn’t help but follow wherever he led.

By Anthony Boadle                     BRASILIA, Oct 8 (Reuters) - Brazil managed to alleviate poverty with emergency payments during the COVID-19 pandemic, but if government income support efforts are not continued 15 million Brazilians will be thrown back into dire poverty come January, an economist warned on Thursday.                     Extension of the generous subsidies is stalled in Congress and faces some opposition from within the government whose economic policy team worries about an uncontrolled budget deficit.                     "We're between a rock and a hard place," economist Marcelo Neri, head of social policies at the FGV higher education think tank in Rio de Janeiro, told Reuters.                     An FGV study published on Thursday said the number of poor Brazilians, those that earn less than half of a minimum wage, or 515 reais ($92) per month, fell 23.7% to a new low of 50 million people thanks to the monthly payments that started at 600 reais, but have now been cut to 300 reais and expire on Dec. 31.                     Far-right President Jair Bolsonaro, whose popularity has risen thanks to the hand-outs, is scrambling to find a way to maintain payments, but there is no way to fund them without breaking a constitutional spending cap and worsening a run-away budget deficit.                     Brazil was more generous than other Latin American nations with its poor during the pandemic even though its fiscal situation was worse; although Economy Minister Paulo Guedes was trying to keep his fiscal austerity drive on track, Neri said.                     "Guedes turned out to be a surprisingly generous manager of Keynesian policies. Now, we have to continue being half Keynesian, but we don't have the money," Neri said.                     Brazil, which had seen large-scale capital flight from the Sao Paulo stock market earlier this year, risks rattling investors further if it boosts spending too much in 2021, the Princeton University-trained economist warned.                     The COVID-19 payments will have cost the Treasury 321.8 billion reais ($57.6 billion) by year's end.                     A member of the congressional joint budget committee, Senator Ney Suassuna, told Reuters there was no consensus on how to pay for income support next year even as the pandemic crisis is expected to continue with scant improvement of the labor market.                     Like in most of Latin America, the pandemic has reduced the size of the traditional middle class, with 4.8 million Brazilians slipping down due to lost income, Neri said.                     Millions of middle class Latin Americans are being dragged into poverty by the COVID-19 outbreak, which has hit the region's labor market harder than elsewhere in the world. Poverty is set to surge back to 2005 levels in Latin America.                     "It's a terrible anguish, to get to my age ... to have brought up two sons, and today I have no way to look after myself," said Maria Lucia Spolzino Porto, an unemployed mother who moved in with her adult son. "I don't have a house, I don't have a job. I live from the help my son is giving today." (Reporting by Anthony Boadle and Gabriel Pontes; Editing by Aurora Ellis)

In addition to CLECO personnel, the company says they have secured 1,861 contractor workers, including distribution line mechanics, vegetation specialists, damage assessors and transmission resources, ahead of Hurricane Delta’s expected landfall along the Louisiana coast on Friday.
 “While there’s still a good deal of uncertainty on how strong Hurricane Delta will be, it continues to track towards the Louisiana coast. It’s looking more likely that it will impact much of our service territory,” said James Lass, director of distribution operations and emergency management. “As of this afternoon, the storm is projected to make landfall Friday afternoon with winds as strong as 100 mph which could cause widespread power outages.”
 Hurricane Delta threatens to be the second hurricane to hit CLECO’s service territory in less than six weeks. CLECO wrapped up restoration work from Hurricane Laura in mid-September.
 “Having two major hurricanes back-to-back in much of the same area that was impacted by Hurricane Laura can be challenging, but CLECO is ready to respond,” said Lass. “We encourage our customers to be ready as well. Prepare now and be mindful of the COVID-19 pandemic when developing your plan. Take the necessary steps to protect your family and your property.”

 # IU football is ready to unleash a 'monster' in the defensive backfield
 Jon Blau
 Bloomington Herald-Times
 View Comments
 BLOOMINGTON -- Unable to see Devon “Monster” Matthews spin his wheels in the flesh, new Indiana safeties coach Jason Jones could at least see them turning from a distance.
 During their regular Zoom calls in the spring and summer, Jones would test the junior “rover” on his knowledge of the Hoosiers’ 4-2-5 scheme.
 “He can tell me exactly what he’s supposed to be doing … what the free safety is supposed to be doing … and also the husky and the two corners,” said Jones, who came over from Florida Atlantic in January. “He knows the responsibilities of all five guys on the field.”
 It may seem like a small thing, but it was a clue for Jones about what was coming this fall. A 6-foot-2, 202-pound safety with the frame and athleticism to span one sideline to the other — and with a nickname that hints at how that combo can play on the field — was tapping into something that elevates football players.
 When the Hoosiers returned to campus, Jones was fielding texts and calls about Play 16 from practice two days earlier. Matthews was still watching his film, wanting to know how to be better. And when it was time to hit the field, Matthews showed his new coach that what was percolating mentally wasn’t just book smarts.
 “He’s making the checks, he’s making the adjustments, and he sees the routes developing, and he sees the runs, and he’s playing a lot faster,” Jones said.
 “I could see it in the Zoom meetings. And now, being in-person, it’s really starting to show.”
 Matthews is just one poignant example of a young athlete coming closer to fulfilling his promise for IU’s defense. The unit, as a whole, from junior free safety Jamar Johnson, to junior linebackers Micah McFadden and Cam Jones, to corners Jaylin Williams, Reese Taylor, and Taiwan Mullen, has a litany of players who seem primed to take another step on the field in 2020.
 By all accounts, they are flying to the ball faster. They are anticipating what is coming more regularly.
 And not just on the first play.
 “So early in the game, they went to this. What’s next, right? We spent a lot of time as a defense talking about what is next,” IU defensive coordinator Kane Wommack said. “If there are about eight to 10 to 15 plays in a game that determine the outcome of the game, if we, in those eight to 15 plays, can anticipate and react a little bit faster, right, we can significantly influence the outcome of the game. We just got more players on the field that can do that.
 “But we have to execute and actually show up in about two and a half weeks here.”
 Soon enough, the Hoosiers will kick off with No. 9 Penn State at Memorial Stadium, and how much the defense has improved will be put to the test. But there have at least been encouraging signs.
 In last Saturday’s first intrasquad scrimmage, IU’s defense had just four missed tackles, leading to seven yards gained after contact. Wommack, who hasn’t forgotten last season’s opener with Ball State, noted a contrast with the 23 missed tackles for 168 yards after contact the Cardinals had that day.
 Up front, Wommack feels the Hoosiers are more physical, better able to win with their hands. On the backend with Matthews and Johnson, the Hoosiers hope to have two playmakers who can affect both the run and pass.
 Both Matthews and Johnson were able to play significant snaps as freshmen and sophomores.

 “Everybody’s freshman year, everybody nervous, everybody not understanding it,” Matthews said. “But now going into two years … everybody knows the defense, everybody understands different formations and stuff like that.”
 In the Gator Bowl versus Tennessee — played back in Matthews’ hometown of Jacksonville, Fla. — the IU coaching staff saw their two safeties playing at a high level. Johnson, still working primarily at the hybrid “husky” position, had a 63-yard interception for a touchdown. Matthews nearly came up with an interception of his own, settling instead for two pass breakups.
 In an unconventional offseason, Matthews continued to make strides, and it’s in the small details where he seems more engaged on the field. For instance, Wommack raised a hypothetical where Matthews may have been posted up 10 yards off the line of scrimmage on a third-and-5.
 “That’s not going to do anything if they pull up and throw one that’s a six- yard hitch route, right?” Wommack said. “Things like that, understanding situational defense … but the biggest thing is he has such a rep base of offensive recognition. He knows what’s coming. And, better yet, we can teach guys to know what is coming, but what is the answer off of that play?”
 In those offseason Zoom meetings, Matthews seemed to know the answer. And when he returned to the field, he still had them. He’s moved at a speed Jones thought was coming.
 Wommack hopes that speed will show up during the eight to 15 plays that can change the course of a game. And if it does, Matthews becomes exactly the kind of Monster the Hoosiers have hoped for in the secondary.
 “Shoot, it’s going into my third year, so I definitely got to understand (the defense) more,” Matthews said. “That’s really helping me a lot, the experience. I feel a great year coming.”
