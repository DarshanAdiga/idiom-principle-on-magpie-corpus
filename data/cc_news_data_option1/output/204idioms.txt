Forty years ago next month, the Adirondack village of Lake Placid in upper New York State hosted the 13th Olympic Winter Games. The heroics of the U.S. men's hockey team's improbable win over the Russians and speed skater Eric Heiden's five gold medals made the 1980 games one for the ages.      Starting Feb. 14, the Lake Placid community will celebrate its legacy by hosting a full slate of activities that embody the Olympic spirit by re- creating the opening ceremony and torch lighting as well as skiing events with Olympic athletes.      As the site of North America's first winter Olympics, in 1932, Lake Placid is one of only three cities worldwide to have hosted two Olympic Winter Games. Since then it has played host to annual winter world championship events and other large-scale sporting competitions.      This small village of 3,400 has an unmatched Olympic legacy. It has sent at least one athlete to every winter games and in total has sent more than l00 athletes to compete since the first modern winter games in l924. The original rinks from l932 and 1980 seat 2,600 and 8,500 people for events.      Visitors can experience the glory and excitement of the Olympics by touring the Olympic complex and museum. In the building where the 1980 hockey game took place, the museum features videos, interactive displays, graphics and historic artifacts. It's fascinating to relive one of the greatest sports moments of the 20th century while watching original footage of the game.      It was here that 20-year-old Sonja Henie won the gold medal in l932 and charmed the world. She helped transform ice skating into entertainment art. Herb Brooks Arena, named for the coach of the 1980 gold medal U.S. hockey team, hosts skating competitions and Saturday night ice shows.      The museum, open l0 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily, is on Main Street next to the arena. Entrance is free with an Olympic Sites Passport available at the Olympic Center box office.      1980 was an extraordinary year for U.S. athletes, and Lake Placid was at the center of it all. The eyes of the world were on the hockey game that will always be remembered as the "Miracle on Ice." The U.S victory rallied the entire nation as the U.S. team managed to defeat the best teams in the world. The U.S. team was a group of college players who had only been practicing together for six months. They beat the Soviets 4-3 and Finland 4-2 in the exciting final to capture the gold medal.      Preservation is a key museum core value. The original jackets, hockey sticks and other equipment of the players are displayed. Henie's costumes and skates are also on view.      Anniversary activities kick off with the opening ceremony Feb. 14. The torch run by 1980 Games torchbearers and local athletes will be followed by the 1980 Olympic cauldron lighting. Other events include:   • A meet and greet with medalist Dan Jansen.   • Learning the biathlon, curling and luge from athletes and coaches.   • Screening of the Disney movie "Miracle on Ice" at the Palace Theatre.   • Cross-country or downhill skiing.   • A 1980s Family Fun Party at the Olympic Ski Jumping Complex.   • A Fun Zone is scheduled each day between 4 and 6 p.m. on Main Street, where visitors can enjoy hot chocolate, s'mores and games. Restaurants, bars and shops will get in the spirit with live music and events.   Lake Placid is a five-hour drive north of New York City. For information, visit lakeplacid.com.

World cricketer of the year Ben Stokes survived three reviews by South Africa as he and Ollie Pope regained the initiative for England on the first day of the third Test at St George's Park on Thursday.
 England were 224 for four at the end of an attritional day during which South Africa had briefly claimed the advantage.
 England were 148 for four when Stokes and Pope came together, in danger of failing to capitalise on batting first on a placid pitch on a hot, sunny day.
 But the pair added 76 without being parted and were able to lift a slow scoring rate after England were able to score only 117 for two in 58 overs before tea. Stokes was unbeaten on 38 at the close while Pope made 39 not out.
 Stokes came into the match a day after being named player of the year by the International Cricket Council and on the back of a man-of-the-match performance when England levelled the four-match series by winning the second Test in Cape Town by 189 runs.
 Stokes made a shaky start, surviving a leg before wicket review on umpire's call against left-arm spinner Keshav Maharaj and an appeal for a catch at slip off what South Africa thought was an inside edge off the pad.
 South Africa wasted their last review when Stokes played no shot against Vernon Philander with the second new ball but the ball was well outside the off stump.
 Kagiso Rabada took two wickets for South Africa but the home team's most impressive bowler was Maharaj who took one for 55 in 32 overs. He bowled an unbroken spell of 30 overs which enabled captain Faf du Plessis to rotate his fast bowlers as England struggled to assert themselves.
 \- Openers fall into leg-side trap -
 Zak Crawley and Dom Sibley gave England a solid start, putting on 70 for the first wicket but both fell to catches at backward square leg.
 Joe Denly was leg before to Maharaj when South Africa successfully sought a review which showed a ball headed for the stumps had hit pad before bat, while Root was beaten and bowled by a fast delivery from Rabada which hit the top of his off stump.
 With the four-match series tied at 1-1, batting first appeared to be a considerable advantage on a pitch which had a fair covering of grass but which offered no help to the bowlers.
 It was the sixth successive Test toss lost by Du Plessis.
 South Africa picked new cap Dane Paterson as a specialist fast bowler in place of all-rounder Dwaine Pretorius. Paterson surprisingly shared the new ball with Philander, with the quicker Rabada and Anrich Nortje having to wait for their turn.
 England brought back fast bowler Mark Wood in place of the injured James Anderson. Wood has not played since the World Cup final in July because of a knee injury but has been working on his fitness since the beginning of the tour. Wood has not played in a red-ball match since a Test series in the West Indies last February.

Peacock is debuting in the middle of the streaming wars which has media companies like Disney and WarnerMedia, CNN's parent company, competing with the likes of Netflix and Amazon. Like its rivals, Peacock will be competing for your time, money and attention. The streaming service's biggest pitch so far is that it relies heavily on easily digestible sitcoms and TV comedies, which have become popular fodder for streamers in recent years.
 The service will host classic comedies like "30 Rock," "Cheers," "Frasier" and every season of "Saturday Night Live." It will also be the exclusive streaming home for popular sitcoms like "Parks and Recreation" and "The Office." The mockumentary starring Steve Carrell has been a viewership juggernaut for Netflix and will leave the service for Peacock in 2021.
 The Universal part of NBCUniversal will also have a presence on Peacock.
 Blockbusters from Universal Pictures such as movies in the Fast & Furious and Jason Bourne franchises will be on the service. So will classics like "Jaws," "E.T. the Extra Terrestrial," "Field of Dreams" and "Back to the Future." Peacock will also have content for kids from DreamWorks Animation such as "Shrek" and films from the Despicable Me franchise.
 There will be an original crime series called "Dr. Death" starring Alec Baldwin and "Brave New World," another original series, this one starring Demi Moore based on Aldous Huxley's dystopian novel. Reboots of old favorites like "Saved By the Bell" and "Battlestar Galactica" will also live exclusively on the service.
 Other reports stated that the service could also include "The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon," which users may be able to watch clips of before its 11:35 PM air time. It could also include NBC News and the 2020 Summer Olympics.

The third day of testimony in Yankton began with a Sioux Falls orthopedic surgeon Richard Blake Curd, who used his expertise to analyze X-rays of Falkenberg’s right hand after LaFramboises’s death. Several witnesses who saw him on March 1 testified that his right hand was swollen enough that, in at least one instance, he used his left hand to sign for a purchase.
 According to Curd, Falkenberg told medical personnel on one occasion that he injured his hand punching an icicle. The other visit recorded the cause of the injury as a fall.
 Prosecutors asked if punching an icicle or a fall would explain the injury. Curd said it would depend on the icicle.
 When cross-examined by the defense, Curd said that the two different recorded causes could have been the result of error in the records and did not necessarily mean that Falkenberg had told two different stories.
 The forensic pathologist who examined LaFramboise’s remains, Adam Covach, chief medical examiner for Fond du Lac County, Wis., testified as to the condition and identification of the body and conclusions about LaFramboise’s death drawn in the autopsy report.
 An external exam, Covach said, was conducted on March 16. The body was allowed to thaw and, 24 hours later, he performed an internal exam. Blood oozing from the stumps left behind from her dismemberment indicated that she had been dismembered after being frozen, he said. The fact the there was so much blood still in the body indicated that LaFramboise had not lost very much blood at the time of her death.
 There was no evidence of trauma to LaFramboise’s remains and her heart and organs were in excellent health, Covach said. The fact that she was dismembered and dumped required Covach to determine the cause of death as homicide by unspecified means.
 The defense was particularly interested in the levels of methamphetamine in LaFramboise’s blood at the time of her death. LaFramboise had struggled with substance abuse, particularly methamphetamine.
 A toxicology report showed that she had 350 nanograms per milliliter of methamphetamine in her blood. Covach said that amount could cause an overdose. Specifically, it could cause cardiac arrhythmia, which could not be traced; a stroke; or a brain aneurysm.
 However, that amount of meth typically would only kill a person weakened by heart and blood pressure issues. Most overdoses of methamphetamine are from between 1,000 and 7,000 nanograms per milliliter of meth in the bloodstream, he said.
 “The autopsy did not discover the cause of death with the part of the body I got to examine,” Covach said.
 Asked if having the head and other missing body parts would have aided in determining if a stroke or aneurysm had caused LaFramboise’s death, Covach replied, “It would have helped.”
 The defense continued with witnesses who showed that LaFramboise was on probation for her drug use and had violated that probation more than once.

Behind the scenes, Peacock and NBCUniversal have gone through some executive shifts since announcing the service last September.
 Bonnie Hammer, NBCUniversal's former chairman of direct-to-consumer and digital enterprises, who was overseeing the launch, shifted to a new role as chairman of NBCUniversal Content Studios in October. Most notably, Steve Burke, NBCUniversal's CEO, announced in December that he was stepping down to a chairman role on January 1 and would retire in August. Jeff Shell, the chairman of NBC's film and network TV businesses, stepped in for Burke and will now lead the company into its new streaming era.
 Burke noted in October that the most important thing to consider when thinking about Peacock is that the company is "not doing the same strategy" as Netflix, which runs on an ad-free subscription model.
 "We're primarily working with the existing ecosystem and doing a lot of [advertising-supported video on demand] activity," he said during an October earnings call.
 The service could play to fact that the company's is part of Comcast, which is "the biggest provider of television advertising in the United States," he added.
 "The product is beautiful and very different," Burke told analysts. "I think something that we're all going to be very proud of when we launch in April."

Changes to Georgia’s dual enrollment program could be in the offing that would nix free college-level classes for freshman high schoolers.
 Costs for the program allowing high-school students to take post-secondary classes have swelled from around $23 million in 2015 to around $140 million projected for the 2021 fiscal year. A revised bill presented to a state Senate committee Wednesday would cap enrollment enough to keep the program within its roughly $100 million budget for this year, Georgia Student Finance Commission President Caylee Noggle said.
 Sponsored by state Rep. Bert Reeves, R-Marietta, the bill aims to keep growing enrollment in the program from overwhelming its budget. It has the backing of Gov. Brian Kemp. On Wednesday, Reeves said the program’s taxpayer-funded offerings have evolved beyond their original intent, noting some students can now enroll in exercise classes like Zumba.

A compromise bill to collect taxes on online sales overseen by large retailers like Amazon, plus the ride-share companies Uber and Lyft, was hashed out Thursday morning by a group of Georgia House and Senate lawmakers.
 The measure, House Bill 276, would require sales taxes to be collected in Georgia on so-called “marketplace facilitators” that allow third-party companies to conduct business on their websites. If passed, lawmakers expect sales tax collections could increase by hundreds of millions of dollars and help shore up sluggish state tax revenues seen in Georgia so far this year.
 Along with retail giants Amazon, Google, and Walmart, the tax would apply to sales made on mobile apps run by Uber. Earlier versions of Thursday’s compromise bill stalled last year in the Legislature when Uber sought an exemption to the tax.
 Senate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Hufstetler, R-Rome, said the compromise bill nixes exemptions across the board. It would set up a structure to recoup taxes that Hufstetler said the Georgia Department of Revenue are already owed under state law, but are not being collected.
 “There’s no special breaks for anybody in it,” he said.
 However, Hufstetler said Uber does plan to pursue a tax exemption in a separate bill. Hufstetler said that bill would likely be filed in the House, but he did not know any details of it otherwise.
 Uber warned that passing the bill could hit Georgian ride-share users with higher trip costs and decrease earnings for drivers. The San Francisco-based company wants legislation that would give a “reasonable alternative” to a tax.
 “We agree that addressing inequities between online and brick-and-mortar retailers is an important issues,” said Uber spokeswoman Evangeline Georgia. “However, if action is not taken to put a reasonable fee structure on ride- share in place, Georgians will end up paying one of the highest ride-share taxes in the nation.”
 Thursday’s bill was settled in a conference committee of six House and Senate lawmakers including Hufstetler and House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Brett Harrell, R-Snellville, who was the original bill’s sponsor. A vote on the House floor to approve the bill was expected later Thursday.
 Other members of the conference committee included Senate Majority Leader Mike Dugan, R-Carrollton; Senate Minority Leader Steve Henson, D-Stone Mountain; Rep. Bruce Williamson, R-Monroe; and Rep. Matt Dollar, R-east Cobb.
 Resolution of the bill came hours before Gov. Brian Kemp was scheduled to outline his legislative priorities for the 2020 General Assembly session in his annual State of the State address on the House floor. His decision to order state government agencies to trim their budgets by 4% this fiscal year and 6% in the 2021 fiscal year has taken center stage as lawmakers look for ways to drum up more revenue in the legislative session that began Monday.

Two Bartow state lawmakers say they want to see the effect a proposed state income tax cut will have on state services in the budget before deciding how they will vote on it.
 The General Assembly in 2018 approved legislation to cut the rate to its current 5.75% with a second cut to 5.5% this year if approved by lawmakers.
 House Speaker David Ralston, R-Blue Ridge, told reporters before the session began that he hoped lawmakers approve the 2020 tax cut.
 However, Gov. Brian Kemp has said the 2018 cut was a factor in him ordering state departments to cut 4% from their 2020 budgets and 6% from their 2021 budgets.
 Media outlets also have reported the reduced tax revenues this year may have placed in peril the remaining $2,000 of the $5,000 pay raise Kemp promised to teachers during his 2018 campaign — which Ralston confirmed may not be available this year.
 District 15 State Rep. Matthew Gambill, R-Cartersville, said he is “generally in support of ways that we can reduce the tax burden on hard-working Georgians” and was “very supportive” of a state income tax cut generally.
 However, he said he had “not seen the legislation” and wanted more details on the effect of the cut on revenues before deciding how to proceed on the issue.
 “By and large, I am in support of tax relief when we can for hard-working Georgians,” he said.
 District 14 State Sen. Bruce Thompson, R-White, called the situation a “bit of a quandary.”
 “I expect the governor to be very prudent,” Thompson said.
 He said he believed in giving tax cuts and generally believed in reducing the size of government “if possible.”
 If faced with a budget shortfall in his private business, Thompson said he would freeze spending and look for opportunities for cutting waste.
 However, lawmakers are dealing with a state budget and must be careful not to cut programs tied to federal funds or responsibilities which could lead to further reductions in revenues, he said.
 The two Bartow lawmakers also mentioned they wanted to see the General Assembly make progress in the areas of future educational opportunities for students and help for veterans and their families.
 Gambill said he did not have a specific bill he wanted the Legislature to approve this session but hoped attention will continue on education and economic development.
 They were “two things I talked a lot about when I ran a little over a year ago,” he said.
 “I’m still very focused in that area,” Gambill said.
 “How are we aligning our educational opportunities for students and making sure they’re fully advised on the relationship between their degrees or their certificates and the careers that are available in our state — or even the careers in the future?”
 Thompson said he was hoping to see the General Assembly consider legislation he was helping to craft to help veterans and their families.
 The senator, who is chairman of the Senate Veterans, Military, and Homeland Security Committee, said the legislation would involve the state government recognizing military members’ spouses’ professional licenses received in other states.
