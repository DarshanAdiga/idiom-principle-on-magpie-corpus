For over 20 years, Paul Gripper, also known as “Unk P,” inspired youths in Philadelphia through the game of basketball. As an AAU coach, he brought a unique perspective and competitive spirit to grassroots and scholastic basketball. Gripper died on Saturday, April 11, 2020. He was 50.
 “I’ve known Paul since 1986,” said friend Maurice Watson Sr. “He was a very intelligent person who had the gift for gab. He could talk his way out of anything. He was just a great overall person. He’ll never be forgotten. I’ll continue to honor his dreams and legacy.”
 Known for being outspoken, overbearing, and at times tough, Gripper demanded the best out of each player he encountered, often forging a strong bond with them on and off the court.
 “Paul and I actually did an internet-based sports talk show together about two years ago, but prior to that I knew Paul through his work with area middle and high school guys,” said Delgreco K. Wilson, founder and director of Black Cager Sports Media. “My first initial reaction to him was that I thought he was overbearing. He was full of bravado and bluster. He used to be on the sidelines cussing, yelling, and he would be loud.
 “Even when his teams were winning, he didn’t let up. He was still making these kids play as hard as they possibly could for him. As I began to know him over time, I really started to see why he was so passionate and the reason behind what he was doing. He wanted his kids to be fully ready to deal with high school and college. He was just a fantastic youth basketball coach with so much knowledge.”
 A native of North Philadelphia, Gripper grew up at 25th and Diamond. He played basketball at Frankford High School under legendary coach Vince Miller, where he was known for a nice jumpshot.
 While Gripper always had a love for sports, it wasn’t until his son began playing in basketball leagues as a kid that he started to see the sport in a different light.
 “Paul heard about a Biddy Basketball League that I was directing out of the West Philadelphia YMCA,” Watson said. “When Paul walked into that YMCA, it would change his life forever because he would have an opportunity to develop his son Joey into a great player. Paul and I took our sons to a youth AAU program named The Untouchables, run by the late Joe Bradley.
 “We traveled all around the mid-Atlantic area doing tournaments. We were so amazed by what we experienced that we started our own program called the Baby Ballers. His daughter Ashley actually got her start in basketball by playing in the Baby Ballers program. We would take teams of 9-year-olds to leagues such as Hank Gathers and Mallory Recreation Center as well as citywide rec tournaments.
 “We also went to tournaments in Virginia, Baltimore and New York. We competed with teams Virginia Pride, which is where we met Quinn Cook, the Baltimore Stars, New York’s Gauchos. We went to Florida to play in the AAU nationals,” he said. “Through our success, we began to draw the attention of sponsors that wanted us to play under their name. Paul brokered a deal with Lateef Sprately, Omar Teagle and Jay Erving for our program to become the Corey Erving All Stars.”
 Throughout his career, Gripper would bring a high level of competitiveness to Philadelphia middle school level basketball. He wanted to build dynasties and win nationals. He would go out and get the best players to be a part of his program. He would have players flying in from Ohio, driving from South Carolina and Georgia to play in his program.
 Some of the players who played for Gripper included Michael Kidd-Gilchrist, Jabril Trawick, Maurice Watson Jr., Zahree Harrison and Eric Esposito.
 “Michael Kidd-Gilchrist was drafted by the NBA and he’s had a long NBA career,” Wilson said. “Jabril Trawick played four years at Georgetown and he was a starter for three years. He’s a graduate of Georgetown University. Maurice Watson Jr. is an All-American candidate at Creighton University.
 “Zahree Harrison is a 2020 graduate of Cheltenham High School. He was just awarded a scholarship to Saint Francis University of Pennsylvania. Eric Esposito is a sophomore at Holy Family University right now. These are just some of the players that came through Paul’s program. He mentored so many kids over the years.
 “He made sure that his players were competitive on the court, but he also made sure they were doing what they were supposed to be doing academically,” he added. “If players’ grades weren’t where they needed to be, there were consequences for it. He held them accountable. He was an incredible coach, but he was truly an even better person.”
 He is survived by: children, Ashley, Pauly, Joey; mother Judy; sisters Naima, Maggie, and brother Jolon.
 Services for Gripper are pending.

The Mariners 2019-20 season, the second in the history of the franchise, saw the birth of the "Community Collections" program, in which the Mariners held three different drives over the course of the season to benefit local non- profit organizations. In October and November, Mariners fans donated 1,500 pounds of non-perishable food items for the South Portland Food Cupboard. The collection effort changed to socks and underwear for December and January - including the first annual "Underwear Toss" game on February 9th, 2020. A total of 2,006 pairs of underwear and 587 pairs of socks were collected and donated to Preble Street Teen Services. For February and a shortened March schedule, 157 books were collected for Ronald McDonald House Charities of Maine.
 The Mariners met 275 donation requests this past season, donating $24,200 in team merchandise, tickets, and other goods. Beacon The Puffin and Mariners players and staff gave 175 hours of their time in appearances over the course of the 2019-20 season. The inaugural summer reading program, "Read With ME," encouraged 165 registered students to accumulate reading hours to earn Mariners prizes. The program is now open for the summer of 2020. Several Mariners players participated in "Movember," and competed in a facial hair popularity contest, raising $3,870 for men's health initiatives throughout the month of November.
 "I think it's awesome when we can find some time throughout the season to get out in the community," said Mariners forward Dillan Fox. "I know it's something every guy loves to do when they get the chance and it was awesome having the competition with Movember and seeing our fans rally around us during that was really special."
 A number of regular events during games at the Cross Insurance Arena also contributed to the community outreach. The "Stick Taps" program honored 18 non-profit organizations at home games in the 2019-20 season. Heroes Harbor - in partnership with Partners Bank, offers a complimentary suite to a local, nominated military veteran, police, fire or EMT member at each game. An additional 55 tickets were donated to military personnel in the "Sponsor a Service Member" program. "Goalies Who Give," was started by Mariners goaltender Tom McCollum in November and provided four tickets for each home game to STRIVE - a local non-profit that serves people of all ages with intellectual disabilities.
 "This is what minor league hockey is all about," said Riley Armstrong, Mariners Head Coach and Assistant General Manager. "It's about being a part of the community from the front office to the hockey staff. With the efforts made in the community, it helps build the player to fan relationship."
 "Wes McCauley Appreciation Night" on November 15th, 2019 raised $1,440 for the Portland Hockey Trust through the auction of two McCauley game worn NHL officiating jerseys. On December 7th, 2019, 1,523 stuffed animals were collected for four different local fire departments in the annual "Teddy Bear Toss." In a partnership with Agren and Make-A-Wish Maine, the Mariners wore specialty jerseys designed by 11 year old 'wish kid,' Ellie LaBree on February 2nd, 2020, and raised $4,368 for Make-A-Wish Maine through the auction.
 Twenty organizations took advantage of the Mariners ticket fundraising program, with the Mariners donating $3,849 to causes such as the Captain Joel Barnes Memorial Fund. The Mariners were also instrumental in the creation of the Captain Joel Barnes Community Service Award, which was awarded to Matt St. Pierre, of the Hampden Fire Department at the game on March 1st, 2020.
 Through COVID-19, the Mariners continue to give back to the community. They've partnered with Evergreen Credit Union and fellow pro sports organizations, the Portland Sea Dogs and Maine Red Claws, to support Good Shepherd Food Bank with a virtual food drive at Fans4Food.com. The Mariners are also selling T-Shirts on preorder through April 24th at MarinersOfMaine.com/shop for $20, net proceeds benefitting the United Way of Greater Portland and other local COVID-19 relief funds. The Mariners plan to renew all of their community efforts entering the 2020-21 season, as well as actively seeking new ways to give back in the aftermath of COVID-19 and beyond.

"I think it will be difficult, absolutely, but I would like to conclude the season and conclude it in front of fans because they are a massive part of the sport.
 “It would be strange if we can’t. If we can’t get to that solution, we need to conclude it safely.
 “I hope there’s not too much of a long term impact. Some people see faults, some see it as entertainment. Quarantine would be easier for some if there was football on to watch at the moment.
 “So, I think when we come back to it. I hope from a player, and from a football fans point of view, it doesn't look too different.
 “I think we'll also come back to an industry that's a little tighter knit. When you go through periods like this, people can come out of it with a lot of credit if they act in the right way and do the right things and I think every footballer and the majority of everybody involved in football has a moral conscience and we also feel very privileged that we're in a position that we are out there as role models.
 “So, I think we'll come out of it and everybody should be able to look themselves in the mirror and say I played my part and I contributed to making a difference in society.

The 2020 version is set in the present day with flashbacks to the '80s, as an all-grown-up Julie (Alicia Silverstone) tells her daughter (Camila Morrone) about her teen adventures in the Valley, and what it meant to sneak over the hill to explore the then-scuzzy Hollywood Boulevard with Randy. "I love playing with genres," says director Rachel Lee Goldenberg. "The juxtaposition of the bright, poppy Valley world and the dirty, grimy punk world was an exciting visual idea for me."

Actress Shailene Woodley , who stars in _Endings, Beginnings_ out on digital April 17 and VOD May 1, is also in deep with an art challenge, sending photographs back and forth with her closest friends. You don't have to go all the way with her recommendation (the backgammon might be a little scandalous). "Most of my friends and I are riding solo right now. So, there are a lot of online backgammon games and _Tiger King_ Skype discussions happening," she tells EW. "We also have an art challenge. Every day, we send photographs we've found that inspire us. For some reason, they have all turned extremely erotic. I guess everyone is experiencing empty-bed syndrome."

Food for Thought: My favorite topic

Happy Easter to all, Sunday, April 12, 2020. Hope everyone stayed home and enjoyed.
 As everyone knows, the Coronavirus that started before March 13 closed schools down that afternoon till the end of April, as of now. Since then, church doors are closed and only essential businesses are open. Restaurants are only allowed to do carry out. Never since the Rio Mall opened in the 1960s has it had to close until further notice. Barbers and hairdressers have also had to close down due to the virus. We can go to banks (drive-thru only), grocery stores, doctors (call ahead), and dentist (only emergency-no teeth cleaning), and no elective surgeries being performed at this time. We also need to stay 6 feet apart from everyone and no more than 10 people allowed in a group. Never in yours truly’s 82+ years have I seen anything like this. We are told to STAY HOME, as they do not know much (so far) about the virus.
 In 1918, the Spanish Influenza was like this. There were only 10 people allowed in a group setting. I remember Mother (Daisye Combs Wilson) speaking of this as a child growing up. The family (my mom) lived in Davis, WV, beside the funeral home. She was 8 years old and her brother, Roy Combs, died. He was just 18 years old. They buried him in Davis. He had been dead 6 weeks when they decided to leave. They got permission and put the casket on the back of the truck (would not do that today) and brought him back here and buried him at New Dale Cemetery in Baker. I wished I had asked my mother more questions on the Spanish Influenza.
 We have a Risen Savior, and we have so many good hymns that we think about. To name a few: Jesus Bids Us Shine — you in your small corner and I in mine, I Know Who Holds Tomorrow and It is Well with My Soul.
