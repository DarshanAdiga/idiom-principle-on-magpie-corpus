"We talked early in the week that we could not win an event and still win the meet by 30 or 40 points," Floyd Central coach Joe Perkins said. "That's about what we did. Jeff's overall top end of things made it difficult. We had a lot of events with three swimming in the top six. Overall, the depth we've worked on to develop this year [helped], knowing we didn't have a lot at the top end. We're similar across the board in a lot of events, which makes us very difficult to beat in a meet like this."
 That depth included diving, where the Highlanders had third, fourth and sixth- place finishers with Kaleigh Schuler, Abby Ryan in Ahna Cobb.
 "The divers did a nice job," Perkins said.
 Other runner-up finishers for Floyd Central included Grace Allen in the 100 butterfly and 200 IM; Kylie McDonald in the 100 breaststroke; the 200 freestyle relay of Savanna Liddle, Sydney Baxter, Allen and Bernadette Mueller; and the 400 freestyle relay of Mueller, Allen, Perkins and McDonald.
 Jeffersonville senior Bonnie Dixon also won the 100 backstroke in addition to being a part of the two relay wins. The Red Devils also took third, fourth and fifth in the 500 free with Alyssa Miller, Emily Miller and Mairin Klaus having strong swims.
 "Very competitive meet. We beat the spread, so to speak, looking at entries," Jeff coach Mike Pepa said. "One of my goals was to win the amount of events we won and the other was to get over 300 points, and we did that. I think we swam very, very well. We played around with our lineup a little bit to give us an idea of what we're going to do at sectionals. We'll sit down and see what we think as we go into sectionals."
 McEwen, who has signed to swim at Bellarmine, was just as excited with the two relay victories in season-best times as getting her first individual conference championships.

NEW YORK (AP) -- The Vatican has ordered an investigation of a sexual abuse allegation against Brooklyn Bishop Nicholas DiMarzio, who was previously named by Pope Francis to investigate the church's response to clergy sexual abuse in Buffalo.   Cardinal Timothy Dolan of the Archdiocese of New York received instructions on Jan. 7 to begin an investigation of allegations that DiMarzio molested a child while he was a parish priest in New Jersey in the mid-1970s, according to a statement released over the weekend by Dolan's spokesman Joseph Zwilling.   "As is our practice, the Cardinal will rely on outside professional forensic investigators to assist him in this matter," Zwilling said.   Boston attorney Mitchell Garabedian notified church officials in November that he was preparing a lawsuit on behalf of his client, who alleges to have been repeatedly abused by DiMarzio and a second priest as an altar boy at St. Nicholas Church in Jersey City.   DiMarzio denied the allegation, telling The Associated Press "I am confident I will be fully vindicated."   In October, Pope Francis tapped DiMarzio to investigate the Buffalo Diocese, where Bishop Richard Malone had come under fire for his handling of a burgeoning clergy abuse scandal. Malone resigned in December.

"With oil prices sagging lately, the door has been opened for a notable decline in U.S. gasoline prices, and that's exact what has happened, with more declines likely coming ahead of us before the fun is over," said Patrick DeHaan, head of petroleum analysis for GasBuddy. "The Midwest has been the largest beneficiary of seasonal effects thus far with prices in several areas there declining upwards of 10-15 cents per gallon. The rest of the country will follow lower for the time being as demand for gasoline remains abysmal and the fuel being produced today will have to eventually be purged from the system over the next few months as refiners begin the transition to summer gasoline."

 The five being held hostage were among eight Indonesians on a Malaysian fishing boat that was fishing in Malaysian waters before it was seen entering Philippine waters on Jan. 16, Indonesia's Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
 It said the boat was seen re-entering Malaysian waters the same day with only three people on board. The ministry said those three men told authorities that suspected Abu Sayyaf gunmen took the other five fisherman, including the captain.

TEHRAN, Iran (AP) — Iran's top diplomat has cancelled his trip and will not be attending the Davos Forum, the Iranian Foreign Ministry said Monday amid a crisis with Washington and disputes with Europe over Iran's nuclear steps. The summit in the Swiss resort also comes after Iran earlier this month shot down a Ukrainian passenger plane, killing all 176 people on board. Tensions also remain high between Iran and the U.S. after an American drone killed Revolutionary Guard Gen. Qassem Soleimani in Baghdad. Iran's top diplomat, Mohammad Javad Zarif, had been invited and plans had been made for him to attend the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi said. However, according to Mousavi, officials at the forum changed plans involving Zarif, which led to the diplomat cancelling his trip, the state-run IRNA news agency reported.

La sentenza dell’Human Rights Committee dell’Onu non è vincolante, ma mette tutti i Paesi in guardia sul fatto che potrebbero violare i diritti umani di una persona se la rimandassero in un paese a rischio di pericolo immediato per il clima. Questo non ha impedito all’Onu di respingere la richiesta di Teitiota che asseriva che la sua vita e quella della sua famiglia erano in pericolo a Kiribati. Teitiota viveva a South Tarawa, un’isola che nel 1947 – quando le Kiribati erano ancora la colonia britannica delle Gilbert ed Ellice – aveva solo 1.641 e che nel 2010 ne aveva circa 50.000 nel 2010, perché l'innalzamento del livello del mare aveva reso inabitabili le isole vicine. Un sovraffollamento che ha portato a tensioni sociali, disordini e violenza. Inoltre, secondo Teitiota, su Kiribati i raccolti sono già insufficienti e in rovina a causa del clima e della penuria di acqua e «probabilmente l'isola diventerà inabitabile entro i prossimi 10-15 anni». L’Intergovernmental panel on climate change (Ipcc) ha definito Kiribati come una dei 6 Paesi insulari del Pacifico più minacciati dall'innalzamento del livello del mare. Gli Arcipelaghi che compongono Kirinbati potrebbero diventare inabitabili entro il 2050.

 NEW DELHI -- _Atithi devo bhava_ , a Sanskrit phrase that means a guest is equal to God, is bandied about with a great deal of exuberance in India. But on 23 December, a 24-year-old German exchange student was not only expelled from the country after he attended a protest against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), but he was given just eight hours to pack his belongings and leave.
 "It was totally untransparent," said Jakob Lindenthal in a recent conversation with _HuffPost India.  _"Looking back, it was an experience that I will pass on to people who have to deal with authoritarian institutions wherever it may be in the world."
 Lindenthal, who grew up in Bavaria and studies physics at the Dresden University of Technology, came to the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Madras in July 2019. At a protest in Chennai on 19 December, he held up a sign that read, "1933-1945, We Have Been There."
 "What I was trying to say is that between 1933 and 1945, when Europe was destroyed, there was not a long way to go," he said. "In 1933, it was not visible that all this would happen in the next 12 years. I feel that Indian democracy is at a critical point where there are lots of dangers to it."
 Almost a month after his ordeal, Lindenthal spoke to _HuffPost India_ about the sign he held up at the protest, the hour-long session in which he was grilled by an Indian official, the questions she asked him, and why foreigners expect so much more from India and its government.

Two missiles were fired at the Ukrainian airliner which was downed earlier this month, Iran’s civil aviation authority confirmed on Monday, reported AFP. “Investigators... discovered that two Tor-M1 missiles... were fired at the aircraft,” the aviation authority said in a preliminary report released on its website.
 The aircraft, which belonged to the Ukrainian International Airlines, on January 8 crashed on the outskirts of Tehran hours after Iran bombed two airbases in Iraq used by United States military forces. The crash killed all 176 persons on board, including 82 Iranians, 57 Canadians and 11 Ukrainians. Anti-government protests have erupted across Iran over the incident, and the country is facing growing international pressure.
 Days later, Iran’s armed forces had admitted to shooting down the Ukrainian passenger plane by mistake. Iran has claimed to have arrested 30 people for their role in the plane crash. Tehran has also arrested the person who posted a video of the missile striking the aircraft shortly after it took off from the airport. He is likely to face charges related to national security. Iran attributed the crash to “human error” during an apparent retaliation to the assassination of a top military general by the United States.

Maintaining balance has helped Steemers develop the self-discipline and time- management skills to meet new challenges and achieve personal and professional goals in her own life, she said. While running track at Eastern Oregon State University, she battled gastrointestinal problems that threatened her collegiate running career and sent her into a depression, but she muscled through, earning a bachelor’s degree in biochemistry and a masters in science teaching before enrolling in Idaho State.
 Steemers said she is not the kind of student who defines success by a single grade on an exam or assignment, but whether she did her personal best. A low- test score is not a reason to beat yourself up — use it as a moment to reflect and analyze. What held you back and what can you do differently next time?
 “It’s always easier said than done, but my advice is don’t let mistakes define you. Reach out to a teacher or friend if you need help,” she said.
 Steemers says she didn’t think about setting a world record when she tackled the Inca Trail Marathon; she just tried to do her best. The race was so mentally grueling at one point she laid down and stared up at the sky, wondering if she could go on.
 But she got up and charged forward, battling blisters and nausea, crossing the finish line in an official time of 7 hours, 36 minutes and 10 seconds.
 “I couldn’t believe it. It was so nice to be done. I was just so happy to lay on the ground and eat a sandwich,” she said with a laugh.

Come full-time at Thomond Park last Sunday, Munster supporters got more of a glimpse into the future than they have had in quite some time. That alone will have helped lift the disappointing mood around the province after Munster failed to get out of their Champions Cup pool. Although the poor opposition and circumstances surrounding what was a dead-rubber must be taken into account, it was encouraging to see that four of Munster's brightest young hopes were on the pitch at the same time, helping to see out the victory over the Ospreys. Big things are expected of Fineen Wycherley, Jack O'Sullivan, Craig Casey and Ben Healy, and they each delivered evidence of why. We were quickly reminded of when Leo Cullen handed six players including Garry Ringrose and Tadhg Furlong their first European starts at a similar stage of the 2016 season. That didn't work out too badly for Leinster in the end, did it? Eight of Munster's front-line players will join up with the Ireland squad today, leaving Johann van Graan to juggle his resources over the coming two months. It is an ideal time then to further put his trust in this coming generation who are chomping at the bit for more first-team action. The fixtures computer has been kind to Munster too, which should, in theory at least, help Van Graan to give the likes of Wycherley, O'Sullivan, Casey and Healy more game-time. Munster's season now rests on the PRO14 and, as they found out to their detriment in Europe this year, finishing top of their domestic Conference is vital. But given that their next six games are Kings (home), Zebre (away), Scarlets (home), Benetton (away), Benetton (home) and Cardiff (home), Van Graan should be targeting six wins. Ultimately, this upcoming run will define Munster's season, as well as having a major bearing on their seeding for next season's Champions Cup. With Damian de Allende and RG Snyman on their way to the province in the summer, Munster must give themselves as much of a head start as possible. The expected signings of the South African World Cup-winning pair will help the province bridge that gap, but they must be mindful of relying too much on their impact. That will be easier said than done however, after watching Snyman absolutely destroying Japanese defences on a weekly basis. For evidence of this, search out the online clip of what was a frankly ludicrously good try from the world-class lock over the weekend. Instead, Munster must keep the focus on matters closer to home, particularly over the coming couple of months, because they have young guys who look primed to push on. Wycherley has already shown in his eight starts this season that he is a coming force in the engine room, and he is set to play a key role. O'Sullivan has bounced back well from a serious knee injury and has impressed with every opportunity. Van Graan, who has understandably been keen to ease the hugely talented No 8 back into action, should now be looking to push O'Sullivan on again rather than the likes of Arno Botha (a former Springbok) and Chris Cloete, who have both struggled to live up to their reputations since joining the club. Casey was a real live- wire when he came on last weekend and there was something heartening about seeing a 20-year-old who grew up close to Thomond Park, scoring a try on his home European debut with his second touch of the ball. Healy had less time to impress, yet he showed flashes of his quality with one particular lovely looping pass for Dan Goggin catching the eye. That's before we mention the likes of Shane Daly, Gavin Coombes, Keynan Knox, John Hodnett, Diarmuid Barron, Jonathan Wren, Seán French and the fit-again Jake Flannery, who are all highly rated within the province for good reason. Too often this season, Munster have been slow to trust their younger players, and while no one is calling for them to play every game, this Six Nations window is the ideal time to have their hand somewhat forced. Van Graan faces a tricky task in striking the right balance, but there is no doubt that supporters will be buoyed by what they saw from the stars of the future against the Ospreys. The thing is, perhaps, some of them are ready to have more of an impact right now not just later on. Only time will tell if that proves to be the case, but we will never know unless they are given enough of a chance to prove themselves.

“It is a constitutional travesty,” the lawyers wrote.
 The prosecution team of House managers was spending another day on Capitol Hill preparing for the trial, which will be under heavy security. Before the filing, House prosecutors made their way through crowds of tourists in the Rotunda to tour the Senate chamber.
 In their own filing Monday, House prosecutors replied to Trump’s not guilty plea by making fresh demands for a fair trial in the Senate, where the Republican majority aligned with Trump has not yet disclosed the rules.
 “President Trump asserts that his impeachment is a partisan ‘hoax.’ He is wrong,” the prosecutors wrote in their reply.
 They wrote that the president can’t have it both ways – rejecting the facts of the House case but also stonewalling congressional subpoenas for witnesses and testimony. “Senators must honor their own oaths by holding a fair trial with all relevant evidence,” they wrote.
 The White House document Monday, much more fulsome than its weekend pleading, says the two articles of impeachment brought against the president — abuse of power and obstruction of Congress — don’t amount to impeachment offenses. It asserts that the impeachment inquiry, centered on Trump’s request that Ukraine’s president open an investigation into Democratic rival Joe Biden, was never about finding the truth.
 “Instead, House Democrats were determined from the outset to find some way — any way — to corrupt the extraordinary power of impeachment for use as a political tool to overturn the result of the 2016 election and to interfere in the 2020 election,” Trump’s legal team wrote. “All of that is a dangerous perversion of the Constitution that the Senate should swiftly and roundly condemn.”
 The impeachment case accuses Trump of abusing power by withholding military aid from Ukraine at the same time that he was seeking an investigation into Biden, and of obstructing Congress by instructing administration officials not to appear for testimony or provide documents, defying congressional subpoenas.

It seems difficult to imagine that answers to such a brief questionnaire have so much power. The 2020 census asks a series of nine basic demographic questions, such as how many people live in your home? What are their names, sex, race, gender and dates of birth?
   
 But the answers to those simple questions - as long as they are registered - have far-reaching consequences, as Erie County Census Outreach Coordinator Michelle Jaggi outlined in an Erie Times-News interview Sunday.
   
 As Jaggi said, it's about power and money.
   
 The demographics tallied in the census translate into the region's political clout. The tabulations are used to determine the number of representatives Pennsylvania has in Congress, which in turn shapes its representation in the Electoral College. Given the state's population trends, Pennsylvania is on track to lose another seat. Getting every last Pennsylvanian counted is critical for the state's voice to be heard.
   
 Secondly, the information gathered is used to measure how federal resources are deployed to meet key needs. The list of programs in play include Medicare, Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program, housing benefits and help with heating bills in the cold winter months.
   
 It is estimated that for each person not counted, the region stands to lose $2,100 per year for 10 years. That is not something that the Erie region can afford at this moment, with both scandalously high poverty rates and many initiatives underway to restore opportunity. As Jaggi said, the money follows not the need but the count tallied in the census.
   
 Getting an accurate count in Erie will be challenging, given the high number of people who rent their homes. It might be difficult to make sure the proper notices and forms reach them.
   
 Language barriers also could hamper efforts at a time when counting every immigrant and refugee is vital. Erie has relied for years on the arrival of new Americans to shore up its population as other residents departed the area. Just a few years ago, Erie welcomed 600 to 700 new individuals a year. But in 2018, due to the Trump administration's immigration policies, the number dropped to about 175, according to the International Institute of Erie.
   
 It was welcome to hear from Jaggi that the census will be available in 12 different languages and that local multicultural organizations have been tapped to aid in outreach.
   
 Scams or fear of them pose another threat to a complete count.
   
 Judging from Jaggi's interview, Erie County, with her help and that of the Complete Count Committee, is heading into this pivotal head count well- prepared.
   
 We credit Erie County and the city of Erie leaders for their proactive approach. We have to get this right.

COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — South Carolina senators will return to the Statehouse this week with a long, complex debate in front of them. Senate leaders have said they will take as much time as needed to debate the education overhaul bill they have been working on for nearly a year. Senate Education Committee Chairman Greg Hembree spent Wednesday and Thursday thoroughly explaining all 59 sections of the bill and answering questions. Starting Tuesday, Hembree expects senators to begin suggesting and voting on changes to the proposal. Some Senate leaders said the debate could last a few weeks. The overhaul bill involves schools of every type and grade level, from pre-kindergarten to technical schools. The bill covers administrative issues ranging from standardized testing to how schools are run. The House passed its own bill last March. The Senate bill has substantial changes including letting school start earlier and adding five teacher workdays to the school year if lawmakers agree to pay for them. Teacher group SC for Ed is encouraging its members to call senators and have them scrap the bill and start their overhaul efforts from scratch. Hembree, a Republican from Horry County, said this is just the start of reform efforts, with items like vouchers and class size possibly taken up in separate bills later.

CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) — Evan Fournier has been dealing with an illness and was feeling incredibly sluggish before Orlando's game at Charlotte. So the veteran guard did something he normally doesn't do, slugging down one of those tiny energy shots as he prepared to take the floor. He said it immediately gave him a spark. “It got me going,” Fournier said with a wide smile as he held of the bottle. \"I just did it because I'm sick. I'm trying anything right now to give me some energy because otherwise I'm just going to be dead tired.” It seemed to work for Fournier, who scored 26 points in the Magic's 106-83 victory over the sliding Hornets on Monday. “He was great,” Magic coach Steve Clifford said. “He's been hurt, he's been sick and he's playing through it. I mean he wasn't good tonight, he was great.” Nikola Vucevic added 24 points and 10 rebounds for Orlando, which closed out a six- game trip with a 3-3 record. Terrence Ross scored 16 of his 19 points in the first half. The Magic shot 14 for 28 from 3-point range. Fournier made six 3s and Ross finished with five. Malik Monk scored 20 points and P.J. Washington had 19 for the Hornets, who have lost seven straight. Orlando began to take control with a 14-1 run to start the second quarter. Charlotte pulled within seven at the end of the third, but the Magic put together a strong finish. Orlando blew the game open with a 27-8 run to start the final period. Fournier made a pair of 3s, Vucevic scored five quick points and Ross threw down a thunderous slam. Fournier and Vucevic each scored 12 in the fourth. “The second half was one of the best we've played this season,” Clifford said. Charlotte has gotten most of its scoring this season from Devonte Graham and Terry Rozier, but both guards struggled...

“Our primary goal is to build a congregation over here,” Henderson said, “and then do over here the kinds of things we’re doing at what we now call our central campus.”          The “new” Chestnut Ridge is at 22088 Hwy. 76 E., between Holly Grove Baptist Church and the Seventh-Day Adventist Church, west of the hospital and east of Lakeside Country Club, in the structure occupied most recently by Grace Community Church.          Chestnut Ridge acquired the building last summer. It looks like it’s brand-new, with an awning added above the entrance and a sanctuary equipped with rows of chairs, and a stage with a set of drums on one side and an organ on the other. It’s spick ’n’ span and clean as a fresh white shirt.          The new location was opened to expand Chestnut Ridge’s range, minister to the Latino community and serve the students of Presbyterian College in Clinton. Plans are underway to teach English as a second language and hold Bible study in Spanish, and conduct services for the students on Thursday nights. A soccer field is in the works.          “We sent 25 of our members out here to start this congregation,” Henderson said. “Some of our people who live in this area are coming here. We want this to be convenient to some of our members, but we also want to reach this community. We are starting the Hispanic ministry the first week of February.”

C-SPAN, joined by the other major television networks, objects to the Senate's plan to essentially allow only two camera views of the impeachment trial from the Senate floor. One would focus on whoever is speaking at the time and the other would be a wider shot of the Senate itself, said Terry Murphy, C-SPAN's vice president of programming, on Monday.
 More camera shots are generally permitted during special events, but not in this case, he said.
 It means, for example, that pictures of how individual senators are reacting to testimony, what groups gather together for informal confabs, or any demonstrations that may take place will generally go missing. The Senate will be the arbiter of what pictures go out, Murphy said.
 “The citizen who gets to sit in the gallery gets a lot better view than the person sitting inside the living room at home,” Murphy said. “All we ask is that the person watching from home get the same view.”
 Restrictions on reporters who sit in the press gallery, including having to go through metal detectors to enter and not being allowed to transmit messages electronically while there, may minimize the immediate value of having those eyes on sight.
 “Can anyone name a time when free flow of information is more important than when impeachment is the issue and the nation is bitterly divided?” said Tom Bettag, a veteran news producer who now teaches journalism at the University of Maryland. "For any one side to try to control the news can only inflame the situation.”
 Typically, reporters have generous access to politicians in the hallways outside. Most senators are keen to talk, although the reaction of Arizona Sen. Martha McSally last week, who called CNN's Manu Raju a “liberal hack” when he tried to ask her a question, illustrate these are fraught times.
 For the public and politicians, information gleaned from these conversations can fill in the blanks about what is happening behind the scenes and how testimony was being taken.
 So journalists were alarmed when initial rules were put in place that would pen in reporters directly outside the Senate chamber and chill attempts at conversations. There's been some progress loosening those rules; reporters were assured Monday that Capitol police would no longer try to break up any interviews they saw in Capitol hallways, as happened late last week, said Sarah Wire, a reporter for the Los Angeles Times and chair of the Standing Committee on Correspondents, which is responsible for credentialing reporters.
 “It is one of the most important moments in American history,” Wire said. “Having reporters speak to senators is important, and not just the senators who choose to speak to reporters.”
 Christopher Isham, Washington bureau chief for CBS News, said discussions are “still fairly fluid” in terms of making it easier for senators who want to talk. He's optimistic that the public will ultimately have roughly the same access to the impeachment trial through the media as it did for President Bill Clinton's trial.

BERLIN (AP) — The German government on Monday downplayed Tunisia's rejection of a last-minute invitation to a weekend conference on Libya that had ruffled feathers in the North African nation. Chancellor Angela Merkel hosted world powers and other countries that have backed one side or the other in Libya's long-running civil war, in a bid to get those who have influence in Libya on the same page. Libya's two main rival leaders also were invited to Berlin, where they held talks with Merkel and her foreign minister ahead of Sunday's conference. Tunisia initially was not invited to the talks about the situation in its neighbor and complained. On Saturday, the Tunisian foreign ministry said it had declined a belated invitation it received Friday, adding that Tunisia was not part of preparatory talks over recent months. “In the course of preparing a conference, it can always happen that a further invitation is extended and it can happen that the (country) invited doesn't consider itself in a position to accept the invitation,” Merkel's spokesman, Steffen Seibert, said Monday. He said Germany talked with U.N. officials and amended the invitations to include Tunisia. “But the most important thing is that it won't — at least if it is up to us — mean any worsening of the German- Tunisian relationship. It is a good relationship,” he said. Participants at the Berlin summit agreed to respect a much-violated arms embargo in Libya, halt military support to the warring parties and push them to reach a full cease-fire.

How to Get Away With Murder

A man has been sentenced to decades in prison by a judge who told him he had “thrown his life away” by killing another man over a small amount of marijuana. John Curtain, 20, was sentenced Friday to 40 years in prison and ordered to spend at least 34 years behind bars before becoming eligible for parole, the Asbury Park Press reported. Monmouth County prosecutors said the Keansburg resident went to a Keyport apartment in August 2018 to buy marijuana but ended up trying to rob two men. The trio ended up wrestling on the floor before 20-year-old Evan Smutz was shot and killed. Curtain said he acted in self-defense and the shooting was accidental. He was convicted in October of felony murder, aggravated manslaughter, armed robbery and weapons offenses. Superior Court Judge Marc LeMieux said it was “unconscionable\" that the victim was shot over a small amount of marijuana. He said the defendant appeared more upset about his conviction than about having killed another human being. “I see someone who has thrown his life away,\" LeMieux said. Curtain declined to address the court when given an opportunity to do so. Defense attorney Carlos Diaz-Cobo said he plans to appeal the verdict and sentence.

 It seems difficult to imagine that answers to such a brief questionnaire have so much power. The 2020 census asks a series of nine basic demographic questions, such as how many people live in your home? What are their names, sex, race, gender and dates of birth?
 But the answers to those simple questions - as long as they are registered - have far-reaching consequences, as Erie County Census Outreach Coordinator Michelle Jaggi outlined in an Erie Times-News interview Sunday.
 As Jaggi said, it's about power and money.
 The demographics tallied in the census translate into the region's political clout. The tabulations are used to determine the number of representatives Pennsylvania has in Congress, which in turn shapes its representation in the Electoral College. Given the state's population trends, Pennsylvania is on track to lose another seat. Getting every last Pennsylvanian counted is critical for the state's voice to be heard.
 Secondly, the information gathered is used to measure how federal resources are deployed to meet key needs. The list of programs in play include Medicare, Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program, housing benefits and help with heating bills in the cold winter months.
 It is estimated that for each person not counted, the region stands to lose $2,100 per year for 10 years. That is not something that the Erie region can afford at this moment, with both scandalously high poverty rates and many initiatives underway to restore opportunity. As Jaggi said, the money follows not the need but the count tallied in the census.
 Getting an accurate count in Erie will be challenging, given the high number of people who rent their homes. It might be difficult to make sure the proper notices and forms reach them.
 Language barriers also could hamper efforts at a time when counting every immigrant and refugee is vital. Erie has relied for years on the arrival of new Americans to shore up its population as other residents departed the area. Just a few years ago, Erie welcomed 600 to 700 new individuals a year. But in 2018, due to the Trump administration's immigration policies, the number dropped to about 175, according to the International Institute of Erie.
 It was welcome to hear from Jaggi that the census will be available in 12 different languages and that local multicultural organizations have been tapped to aid in outreach.
 Scams or fear of them pose another threat to a complete count.
 Judging from Jaggi's interview, Erie County, with her help and that of the Complete Count Committee, is heading into this pivotal head count well- prepared.
 We credit Erie County and the city of Erie leaders for their proactive approach. We have to get this right.

PORTLAND, Maine (AP) — Three members of Congress have introduced a proposal to try to cut down on food waste in U.S. schools. Democratic Reps. Chellie Pingree of Maine and Suzanne Bonamici of Oregon and Republican Rep. Dan Newhouse of Washington are calling the proposal the “School Food Recovery Act.” It aims to create a new program within the U.S. Department of Agriculture that supports schools that work to cut down on food waste. Schools represent “a tremendous opportunity for students to think outside the box, reduce hunger and cut greenhouse gas emissions,” Pingree said. The bill, if approved, would provide grants for schools to help with efforts such as food waste measurement and reporting, prevention, education and reduction projects, the lawmakers said. The money could be used for necessities such as purchasing equipment and providing training. Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics President Terri Raymond said food waste is “one of the most pressing challenges of our time and one that is solvable.”

To keep the peace, the United States must enhance its deterrence posture with China. One way to do so would be to deploy new conventional intermediate-range ballistic missiles to East Asia. China is aggressively building and deploying such missiles, but the United States was banned from doing so under the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty with Russia. This put the United States at a strategic disadvantage in any military standoff, because China knows our only possible response options in a conflict is to target the mainland with intercontinental ballistic missiles — an unacceptable escalation. Thanks to Trump's decision to withdraw from the INF Treaty, we can now deploy conventional medium-range missiles — a move that would restore U.S. military supremacy in the Pacific and improve our ability to deter Chinese aggression.
 As we learned from our recent standoff with Iran, totalitarian regimes have a tendency to miscalculate. It took a military strike to restore deterrence with Iran; we should not wait to restore deterrence with China.

Sophie, Countess of Wessex enjoyed a welcome return to the spotlight on Monday as the British royal family adjusts to life without Meghan Markle and Prince Harry. Sophie (née Sophie Rhys-Jones) has been married to Queen Elizabeth's son Prince Edward for more than 20 years and during that time, has become a quiet confidante to her mother-in-law, while also becoming one of her favourites in the inner sanctum of Buckingham Palace. Sophie and Edward both work as full-time royals, but their star - like most of the queen's children other than Charles - has been overshadowed in recent years by Kate Middleton and Prince William, and until now, Meghan and Harry. But it was a return to their glory days as newlyweds and Sophie and Edward were recruited to help bolster the guestlist with some royal stardust at a reception to mark the UK-Africa Investment Summit at Buckingham Palace. At the same time, 5,000 miles away, Harry finally returned to Canada to reunite with his wife and their eight-month-old son Archie, and officially begin their new life there as semi-private citizens. Grainy pictures of Prince Harry arriving at Vancouver International Airport were published this morning, as were pictures of Meghan carrying her son in an Ergobaby 360 Mesh Omni carrier, walking their two dogs Oz and Guy. The former actress-turned-duchess beamed on a hike at Horth Hill Regional Park on a misty day in Vancouver, and this set of paparazzi shots juxtaposed with the formalities of last night's event at the Palace show the stark difference in the couple have chosen away from the UK. And since their departure - the details of which was finalised on Saturday - there is a vacancy for qualified royals available for official engagements. Since Prince Andrew retired from public life in disgrace after his car crash BBC interview questioning his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein, there are only a handful of experienced royals ready and able to carry them into this time of change. For years, it has been reported that Prince Charles wanted a 'slimmed down' monarchy, similar to other European royal families, but his son - and his family - were central to that. Andrew's daughters Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie both work full-time and the Cambridge children are still babies, which leaves only Princess Anne left to fill the growing workload, but she is turning 70 this year. Her children Zara Tindall and Peter Phillips are both private citizens as she opted not to give them a title at birth, and both are financially independent, only called upon for family-adjacent royal occasions. Which means that suddenly Sophie and Edward have become the most valuable asset of the family now, hiding in plain sight for the last two decades. Although both experienced their own Sussex-esque controversy when it came to earning money prompting their decision to quit their professional lives in 2002 (Sophie as the director of her own PR firm and Edward as an aspiring film producer) and become full-time royals. The couple were introduced to one another in 1993 and were dating for six years, before exchanging vows at St George's Chapel in Windsor, where Meghan and Harry wed in May 2018. Sophie works with 70 charities as part of her work, and spends the rest of her time at engagements working on behalf of Queen Elizabeth. More pertinently, last night also marked Sophie's 55th birthday, a milestone occasion both personally and professionally as she gears up to play a greater role in the next chapter of the royal family. The mother-of-two (to 16-year-old Lady Louise Windsor and 12-year-old James, Viscount Severn) arrived to the event in a cap sleeved knit dress by Alaïa and velvet Jimmy Choo heels in camel; acting as a welcome new icon for middle-aged women the world over and the first step into her new role as a potential superstar-in-waiting. Meanwhile, it was business as usual for Kate, who debuted a new shimmering red midi dress by British label Needle & Thread, and husband William, who hosted the event. It's reported that Wililam and Harry had a private heart to heart before his departure to Canada as the brothers recognised it was time to begin mending their relationship. “It has been ground-breaking in terms of saving their bond as brothers and has been totally driven by them," a source told The Sun. “But Kate and Meghan, who was in Canada, did join in with some of the talks on more than one occasion, which is another sign of a real thaw in their relationship. Things are better."

 Tickets for the Super Bowl LIV matchup between the San Francisco 49ers and Kansas City Chiefs are re-selling in record fashion.  
 According to SeatGeek.com, the current average resale price of a Super Bowl ticket in Miami on Feb. 2 is $6,002, with the lowest ticket running for $5,200. The best seats in the house at Hard Rock Stadium are going for the fan-friendly price of $16,000.  
 The game's location plays a part in the high price, but the lowest ticket price is still $500 more expensive than it was before Sunday's games.  
 By comparison, the next highest-priced Super Bowl ticket came two years ago in Super Bowl LII between the New England Patriots and Philadelphia Eagles in Minneapolis for $5,373. Next was the Super Bowl LIII matchup between the Los Angeles Rams and Patriots in Atlanta for $4,657.  
 SeatGeek communications director Chris Leyden said this year's tickets are \"the most in demand Super Bowl...ever.\"  
 On StubHub, the lowest ticket is going for a lesser $4,651. On Ticketmaster, the lowest is $5,184 as of Monday morning.  
 Those high numbers typically decline in the weeks leading up to the Super Bowl, as resale prices usually surge rapidly immediately following the second conference championship game on Sunday night.  
 A plethora of the impulsive ticket buyers appeared to be Chiefs fans, too. Kansas City generated the highest percentage of geographical ticket orderings according to SeatGeek's data at 12.3%, while large metropolitan areas like New York (12.2%) and Chicago (8.1%) trailed.

A group of people who arranged a meeting with an Erie man to buy marijuana on Sunday planned to rob him of his drugs when a struggle ensued and the man was fatally shot in a westside neighborhood, according to details outlined in the criminal complaints filed against two suspects charged in the crime.
   
 Two other suspects, including a male who one of the charged suspects identified as the person who fired the fatal shots, remained at large on Monday.
   
 Charged in the shooting are Erie residents Melissa A. Seaman, 19, and Michael J. Toles, 22. Both were placed in the Erie County Prison without bond following their arraignments Monday morning on charges of criminal homicide/murder of the first degree and criminal conspiracy to commit robbery.
   
 They are accused of taking part in the killing of the male victim, whose name has not been released, in the area of Southgate Drive and Usonia Avenue on Sunday at about 3 p.m. The neighborhood is located between Peach Street and West Grandview Boulevard.
   
 The victim was found lying on the snow-covered roadway at the intersection of Southgate Drive and Usonia Avenue after Erie police, city firefighters and EmergyCare personnel were called there on Sunday at about 3 p.m. to investigate a report of a possible shooting victim.
   
 The victim was taken by ambulance to UPMC Hamot, where he was pronounced dead in the emergency room at 3:44 p.m. Sunday. An autopsy is scheduled for Tuesday.
   
 Police learned after arriving at the scene that neighbors had heard gunshots and that the man found in the street had been associated with a gray Honda vehicle, Erie police Detective Matthew Berarducci and Detective Patrick Ginkel wrote in the affidavits of probable cause filed with the criminal complaints against Seaman and Toles.
   
 An officer spotted the vehicle attempting to leave the area and tried to stop it. The vehicle drove off but was eventually stopped by police in the rear parking lot of the Taco Bell in the 4300 block of Peach Street, according to the affidavit.
   
 The officer made contact with Seaman, who was driving the Honda, and Toles, who was seated in the back of the vehicle and stated that he had been shot. Toles was taken by ambulance to UPMC Hamot for treatment of a gunshot wound to his right arm, detectives wrote in the affidavit.
   
 Seaman was detained and was found in possession of a large bag of suspected marijuana that was inside her pants, according to the affidavit.
   
 Investigators wrote in the affidavit that police learned from a witness that the victim had approached a stopped vehicle on Southgate Drive and that an unknown male exited a rear passenger seat and motioned the victim into the back. The victim was heard saying he wouldn't sit in the middle before the unknown male got back into the vehicle and the victim followed, detectives wrote in the affidavit.
   
 The vehicle drove off, and a few minutes later the witness reported hearing multiple gunshots and the victim scream. Police were told the vehicle then appeared at the intersection of Southgate Drive and Usonia Avenue and the victim was either pushed from the back seat or fell out, according to the affidavit.
   
 Toles told police during an interview on Sunday night that he was in a vehicle with Seaman and two other males and the group wanted to meet with someone selling "weed" for the purpose of hitting "a lick," which Toles defined as being a set-up robbery, Berarducci and Ginkel wrote in the affidavit.
   
 Toles stated that Seaman directed the group to one location before directing them to the area where they met the victim. He said the victim eventually got into the vehicle and produced two bags of marijuana, according to the affidavit.
   
 Toles said the other male sitting in the back of the vehicle produced a pistol and instructed the victim to get out. The victim grabbed the pistol and Toles said he struck the victim as he was between the victim and the other male as they struggled to get control of the pistol, detectives wrote in the affidavit.
   
 Toles said the other male gained control of the pistol, exited the vehicle, went to the door where the victim was seated, opened the door and began to fire the pistol at the victim. Toles said he was struck by at least one of the rounds, according to the affidavit.
   
 Seaman was interviewed later Sunday night and told detectives she had recently met the victim through a social media platform. She said they began to communicate, and she wanted to meet the victim to buy marijuana. Seaman admitted to contacting him on Sunday and said the victim sent her his address, which she shared with the other occupants of the vehicle, detectives wrote in the affidavit.
   
 The vehicle, a gray Honda Accord, was impounded by police after Toles was taken to the hospital and Seaman was taken into custody. Investigators had not recovered a gun as of Monday afternoon.
   
 Erie police are continuing to search for the two other males Toles said were also in the vehicle at the time of the shooting. Investigators said Sunday that they are looking into the possibility that the males, described as wearing puffy coats, were involved in an attempted carjacking at the Burger King restaurant in the 4200 block of Peach Street. The carjacking was reported at about the time of the shooting.
   
 The carjacking was thwarted when the victim fought off the attackers and they fled, Erie police Deputy Chief Mike Nolan said.
   
 Investigators said Monday that they are working to obtain surveillance video from security cameras in the area that might have captured images of the two male suspects.
   
 Anyone who might have information that could assist in the ongoing shooting investigation, or whose vehicle might have been approached in the area of the shooting on Sunday afternoon, is asked to call Detective Berarducci at 870-1221 or Detective Ginkel at 870-1161.

You are 100% correct. People scream and scream and complain everything falls on deaf ears as far as the Board of Supervisors who are supposed to be the ones to hold her accountable. You try to ask the CEO for any information you just get a huge gigantic circular conversation that blame shifts off to everyone and 6 months later you wind up back at the point you started. It's ridiculous the games that they play and the lack of efficiency all of the money that gets awarded for Grants or new programs gets wasted and squandered down by the higher-ups before anything even happens. It's pretty gosh darn pathetic to watch this happening over and over again when smaller counties arerun much more efficiently and even larger counties run fantastically well and here we are in our swirling cesspool. No help from the higher-ups no help from the attorney general, grand jury reports fall on deaf ears. We should change the name of Mendocino County to Tarpit County. Because that's basically what happens everything gets stuck in the tar pits and that's it.

Longtime LSU defensive backs coach and New Iberia native Corey Raymond has agreed to a three-year contract extension with the national championship- winning football program, according to multiple media reports.
 First reported by Rivals.com, the deal would keep the New Iberia Senior High graduate and LSU alum  for three more years. Raymond, 50, who coached at NISH and Westgate High School before joining the LSU staff in 2006, reportedly turned down an offer to join the staff at Texas A&M over the weekend.
 After working as an intern and assistant strength coach at LSU he coached cornerbacks at Utah State for two years, then coached the secondary at Nebraska before returning to LSU as the defensive backs coach from 2012-17. He has coached cornerbacks since 2018.
 According to the LSU athletics website, LSU’s secondary has produced nine NFL draft picks including 2017 first-round picks Jamal Adams and Tre’Davious White and second-round picks Greedy Williams in 2019 and Donte Jackson in 2018. Raymond also coached Eric Reid, another first-round draft pick, at LSU.
 Seven players coached by Raymond have earned first-team All-America status — Reid (2012), Jalen Mills (2015), Adams (2016), White (2016), Williams (2018) and Grant Delpit (2018, 2019).
 In 2019, LSU freshman cornerback Derek Stingley led the Southeastern Conference in interceptions (6) and passes defended (15). Cornerback Kary Vincent Jr. earlier announced his plans to return for his senior season at LSU.
 A three-year starter in the LSU secondary from 1989-91, Raymond finished his career with 185 tackles and eight interceptions.
 He played three seasons for the New York Giants and three with the Detroit Lions in a six-year NFL career, starting 60 of 90 games and finishing with 258 tackles and 11 interceptions.
 He graduated from LSU in 1993.

Buskirk-Timothy R. Flynn, 65, of Buskirk, passed away Friday, January 17, 2020, at his residence.      Born January 24, 1954, in Cambridge, he was the son of the late Willard and Marjorie (Tate), Flynn. Tim graduated from Cambridge Central School. He held various jobs as a self-taught computer programmer until landing at Global-Z International where he has been for over 20 years. Professionally, he took the abstract and made it concrete, often with a bit of wit mixed in for good measure.      Anyone that knew Tim knew that one thing mattered to him above all else, his family. Whether you were a brother, sister, cousin, or grandson in need, he would drop anything at a moment's notice to lend a hand. From physics projects to batting practice, Tim was always there to help. Even if he wasn't particularly good at the thing you needed a hand with, he would at least show up. More often than not though, he was more than good. He was exactly the person you needed. Humble, curious, and witty- likely found pacing somewhere in the outfield. That was Tim.      In addition to his parents, he was predeceased by his wife, Jeanne Prouty Flynn who passed away in 2004 and a brother, Willard Flynn.      Tim is survived by his children, Matthew (Desiree Wheeler) Flynn of Statesville, NC, Andrew (Rebecca) Flynn of Cambridge and Nathaniel (Christina Green) Flynn of Troy. He is also survived by a grandson, Ari Flynn; his siblings, Michael (Patricia) Flynn of Jamestown, NY, John Flynn of Albany, Patricia (David) Hall of Crown Point, Kathleen Flynn of Saratoga Springs, Mary (Steve) Gifford of Buskirk, Dennis (Nancy) Flynn of Buskirk and Daniel (Bette Lee) Flynn of Troy; his father and mother-in-law, Harold and Elizabeth Prouty of Bennington and many nieces and nephews.      Calling hours are Wednesday, January 22, 2020, from 4-6 pm at the Ackley, Ross & Gariepy Funeral Home, 73 West Main Street, Cambridge.      A mass of Christian burial will be at 11:00 am Thursday, January 23, 2020, at St. Patrick's Church, 17 South Park Street, Cambridge with Tim's cousin, Rev. James Walsh officiating.

The visitors made an explosive start as Ovie Soko opened the scoring on an and-one play, before veteran Mike Tuck got the Sharks going. Jules Dang-Akodo sparked a 9-2 Lions run, cut by Tuck once more to make it 12-7, and it became the Soko-Tuck show as they traded the next 10 points before Dang-Akodo and Ali Tew helped Lions end the quarter 21-11 up. The hosts had an 8-3 run early in the second to halve the deficit, but Andre Lockhart and Soko combined to score and Sam Toluwase nailed a triplee to put Lions 30-21 up. It was nip and tuck after that, though, as Sharks ended with a 5-0 run to make it 43-41 at half time. Sheffield struggled after the restart as Lions built an 18-point lead, with three straight triples from reigning league MVP Justin Robinson. But Sharks fought back in the fourth, although Lions led 83-73 with two minutes left and missed seven free throws before Lockhart sealed their eighth league win. GB international Soko picked up his third double-double since joining the Lions, with 23 points and 11 rebounds, while Robinson shot 69 per cent from the field and 60 per cent from the line. Ogo Adegboye made his debut and played 13 minutes, scoring three points, four rebounds and one block, with Lions heading to Leicester next on January 31.

Yet there had been evidence leading up to Saturday's bout indicating Rosario was not a man to be taken lightly.      “This is the time,” Rosario told Fox's PBC Countdown. “I’m going for what’s mine.” Fighters always say such things – but the accompanying footage of Rosario, his camp life, and his team, indicated something more was in play. Rosario was training out of Miami's 5thStreet Gym and was residing monk-like in a humble home away from family and friends when he wasn't working. A though he came across as extremely disciplined in the footage, Rosario's team still kept a careful eye on him at all times so that the fighter wouldn't engage in the easy day-to-day kinds of things the rest of the world does regularly.      The Williams' fight was serious business – and Rosario was determined. “It is a fight that seems easy for Williams,” Rosario said on-camera. “When the bell rings the audience will have their jaws drop.”He was only off by four rounds. For it was in the fifth that Rosario, who had been battling Williams neck and neck, landed clean on his man, leading to a series of hard punching moments that led the referee to stop the bout and crown a new junior middleweight king. Credit Rosario and trainer Perez for refusing to settle for the role of easy opponent.

WINNIPEG -- Ratifying the new North American Free Trade Agreement will be a top priority for the Trudeau government when Parliament resumes next week.
 Legislation to ban military-style assault rifles will also be high on the agenda for the first extended sitting of Parliament since the Oct. 21 election reduced Justin Trudeau's Liberals to a minority.
 The prime minister may flesh out the agenda more today when he wraps up a three-day cabinet retreat aimed at setting the government's priorities and figuring out how to achieve them when the Liberals no longer hold a majority of seats in the House of Commons.
 Every measure will require support from at least one major opposition party to pass; a defeat on matters of confidence, such as the coming budget, would topple the government.
 The Liberals can probably rely on the support of the Conservatives to win ratification of the new NAFTA, despite the fact that the Tories have accused Trudeau of caving in to concessions demanded by U.S. President Donald Trump.
 The NDP and the Bloc are likely to oppose NAFTA, but are expected to support efforts to strengthen gun control.
 On Monday, government House leader Pablo Rodriguez said ratification of the new NAFTA is "an absolute priority" -- a view echoed by Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland, who was the lead minister throughout the tortuous negotiations to renew the continental trade pact and who remains responsible for seeing it across the finish line.
 "The new NAFTA was ratified last week by the U.S. Senate, it was ratified before Christmas by Mexico. Now it's Canada's turn," Freeland said.
 "I think that is very important for certainty in the Canadian economy, very important for millions of Canadian workers, of Canadian businesses, of Canada families."
 Rodriguez called upon opposition parties to ratify the deal "as quickly as possible."
 "I think we should send a strong message that we are united in the ratification of this very, very important agreement," he said.
 The government did introduce a ratification bill last year, but did not forge ahead with it, preferring not to get ahead of the ratification process in the United States. The bill died when the election was called.
 During the campaign, the Liberals promised a number of measures to stiffen gun control in Canada, including banning assault rifles and empowering municipalities to ban handguns if they so choose.
 Public Safety Minister Bill Blair said Monday that the government will be able to move on some measures faster than others.
 "The prohibition of the assault-style rifles I think is an important step that perhaps could be accomplished in the near term," he said.
 "The arrangements on any potential buy-back (of assault rifles) … will take a little bit more time because I think it's really important that we get good value for the expenditure of taxpayers' dollars and, at the same time, I'm very mindful that we're dealing with law-abiding Canadians and I want to make sure that they're treated fairly and respectfully."
 Blair said part of the discussions about the coming budget will involve how much money is available for programs for communities and kids aimed at preventing gun violence.
 He noted that many municipalities went through "a very difficult summer" last year with a spate of shootings, and indicated that he's hopeful new investments will be made before next summer.
