Selah's mother is a source of constant anxiety, fear, and frustration for Selah. She is unable to explain herself on calls with her mother and definitely finds it difficult to speak to her in person. Her mother judges her 17-year-old as she does an adult. Selah is told where she'll attend college, and that is not a matter she has any say on. This scenario is very close to home for a lot of teenagers whose aspirations are micromanaged by their parents. This leads to a conflict within the self. One one end, the compulsion to do what is expected and on the other, to stay true to who they are. Though this wouldn't be the first time a movie has tried to represent this, it undoubtedly stands out due to the extent up to which Selah goes to make up for her subordinate equation in real life.

This will bring to an end a dusty jumbled assortment of plant labels, “spare” hose fittings, spooled scraps of admirably reusable Flexi-Tie, and so on.

Roy Hodgson's squad are amid an acclimatising training camp in Portugal this week, and have been spotted donning jackets in the heat to further emulate the humidity that will encompass them in South America.
 Everton mainstay Baines, who was long denied a permanent spot in the England setup by Ashley Cole, said he cannot afford to assume the left-back role is exclusively his - with Southampton teenager Luke Shaw also in the squad.
 "I'm not going to allow myself to think I'm the main man,'" Baines said from Portugal.
 "At this level, the competition is always going to be there. You have to keep on your toes and not get complacent because if you don't do the right things then you are not going to be playing.
 "Things can change very quickly so I think whoever starts the first game in the tournament has to do the job otherwise they are not going to stay in the team.
 "I looked at what might happen and it was obvious three doesn't go into two. The manager could have picked any pairing and no one would have really questioned it.
 "But the fact he has chosen me and Luke is a great vote of confidence, especially because Ash is a phenomenal player, a great guy."
 Working in Baines' favour is his experience at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, despite being cut from the final 23-man squad under Fabio Capello - seemingly for a throwaway line.
 Baines said a quote about his children back home in England was translated into homesickness, which may have been a contributing factor to Capello's snub of the defender.
 "What happened with me four years ago goes to show the way people go mad for the World Cup," Baines said.
 "One line, when I talked about my kids, was turned into 'he's homesick'.
 "The fact that I went to Euro 2012 and being ready for this one underlines it was very much taken out of context at the time.
 "It was a disappointment and set me back but now it's coming and I really want to go and enjoy it."
 Baines said he understood careers lived and died on World Cup moments, however, the 29-year-old said he takes everything with a grain of salt.
 "Of course I know there are heroes and villains and stuff like that but how you deal with that is down to you as an individual," he said.
 "You can't deal with situations like that on the horizon. The important thing is perspective. It's easy to say it's a game but it's more when there are so many people who are emotionally involved."

President Donald Trump seemed to continue his feud with Utah Sen. Mitt Romney on Thursday by leaving him off the list of invitees to a new coronavirus task force.
 Romney was the only Republican senator who didn't make the cut for the president's "Opening Up America Again Congressional Group," which is aimed on how to reopen the economy in the face of the coronavirus pandemic.
 An official told CNN that the president reviewed the list of invited lawmakers before it was released on Thursday. A spokesperson for Romney confirmed to The Hill that he was not asked to take part in the task force.
 Trump and Romney have a bitter history, dating back to when Trump was first running for president in 2016. When Trump became the frontrunner in the Republican primary, Romney made a speech calling on Americans to vote tactically to make sure Trump did not win the party's nomination.
 The two briefly appeared to patch things up when Trump considered Romney for a cabinet position when he was elected, and subsequently supported Romney's bid for the Senate in 2018.

Faria has also been fined £30,000, subject to an appeal, having been charged with two counts of misconduct for "abusive and/or insulting words towards the referee and improper conduct" following last month's loss at Stamford Bridge.
 He was visibly outraged by a late penalty awarded to the hosts, converted by Fabio Borini, and needed to be restrained by manager Jose Mourinho when officials told him to leave the technical area.
 The defeat dealt Chelsea a major blow in their hopes for the Premier League title and will be without Faria for their two remaining games this term.
 Midfielder Ramires was charged and subsequently banned for an off-the-ball elbow on Sebastian Larsson during the game, while Mourinho too found himself in hot water for post-match comments.
 Mourinho offered "congratulations" to referees chief Mike Riley and said refereeing body Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL) had done "absolutely fantastic" work when officiating matches involving teams in the title race.
 The FA deemed those comments to be a slight against the integrity of match officials. The Portuguese denied a charge of misconduct and is yet to have any punishment confirmed.

On the bright side, you can also expect a number of small yet important updates delivered to the two high-end smartphones within weeks of their commercial debut based on the company's M.O. from previous years.
   
 One such goodie pack is actually rolling out to the OnePlus 8 and 8 Pro 5G as we speak, even though the handsets haven't been technically released yet. For the time being, only a small batch of units is out in the wild, as reviewers continue to assess the real-life performance of those stunning displays and very interesting camera systems before casting their verdicts, but shipments to regular users are scheduled to begin in just a few days across the old continent.
   
 Stateside, the Snapdragon 865 powerhouses are only slated for an April 29 rollout, but a few lucky early adopters will undoubtedly be able to get their hands on these bad boys way before that date after claiming a special "launch day bundle" yesterday, April 15. When that happens, expect to be prompted to install the OxygenOS 10.5.4 update during your initial device setup process.
   
 As you can imagine, this is largely focused on subtle improvements of general things like system stability and performance optimizations across specific areas like the camera shooting experience and fingerprint unlocking. OnePlus is also trying to make sure its hot new Bullets Wireless Z earbuds will work flawlessly when paired with the OnePlus 8 5G and OnePlus 8 Pro 5G, but somewhat disappointingly, this update still doesn't include Google's April security patches.
   
 Other small but potentially notable things improved before the actual release of the two phones include the back gesture "experience", the animation effect and interaction "experience", and network data transmission performance and stability. As far as all-new features go, Live Caption, video filter, and a double-tap method to wake up the lockscreen in ambient display mode are probably worth a quick mention.

After seven wins on the trot, Marcello Lippi's men had opened up a three point lead at the top of the table but that evaporated as they fell to a 1-0 defeat to their city rivals Guangzhou R&F.
 With an hour played, neither side had been able to break the deadlock at the Tianhe Stadium with Elkeson even missing a first-half penalty for the league leaders, however Abderrazak Hamdallah changed that as he netted his ninth goal of the league campaign to move Sven-Goran Eriksson's side into third.
 Guoan took full advantage of that slip up as they joined Evergrande on 27 points with a 1-0 win over 10-man Liaoning Whowin.
 Despite a close first half, the visitors' task was made harder when forward James Chamanga received a second yellow card just before half time.
 Guoan continued to press for a winner and, in the seventh minute of stoppage time, Pablo Batalla became the hero as he grabbed the only goal of the game from the penalty spot.
 The race for a top-three spot intensified as Shanghai SIPG and Jiangsu Sainty both won while Shandong Luneng lost ground.
 Shanghai SIPG produced an emphatic display to beat Guizhou Renhe 5-2 with Tobias Hysen netting a hat-trick and Daniel McBreen getting the other two for Zhikang Xi's side.
 Shandong Luneng fell to their third successive league defeat with a 1-0 away defeat to Shanghai Shenua, while Jiangsu Sainty ended a run of five-games without a win thanks to Ang Li's fifth minute strike against Changchun Yatai despite Dejan Damjanovic's dismissal.
 Bottom club Harbin Yiteng were unable to add to the four points they picked up in their last two fixtures as Dalian Aerbin recorded a 3-1 victory, and they fell further away from safety as Tianjin Teda beat Henan Jianye 1-0.
 Meanwhile in mid-table, Shanghai Shenxin came from two goals behind against Hangzhou to earn a 2-2 draw thanks to Jailton Paraiba's equaliser.

 For the moment, the market is not responding to the cut, and prices will stay at the same low level due to the halt of global interconnection amid coronavirus lockdowns.
  _" Prices will start growing, and by June we could already see the signs of market recovery,"_ Tankaev said. By that time, prices could reach $40-50 per barrel, although there may be some force majeure circumstances, like the potential second wave of Covid-19.
 His thoughts were echoed by economist Valery Mironov, who said that within a month or two the total production cut could catch up with the fallen level of demand, and there may then be a rebound in prices to up to $40 a barrel.

"About 226 million Indian are suffering from disabling hear loss and only 15000 cochlear implant have been done in India till date", said Dr Sanjay Khanna while addressing the media persons.   Deafness or hearing loss means when a person is unable to hear. Disabling hearing loss refers to hearing loss greater than 40 decibels. According to WHO, around 466 million people worldwide have disabling hear loss, out of which 266 million are Indian and 34 million are children.   60 per cent of childhood hearing loss is due to preventable causes. Hearing loss may result from genetic causes, birth complications, ear infections, few drugs, noise exposure and ageing. It has been estimated that by 2050 over 900 million people or one in every ten people will have disabling hearing loss; however, India has already reached this scenario.   The majority of people with disabling hearing loss live in low- and middle- income countries. Approximately one third of people over 65 years of age are affected by disabling hearing loss and the prevalence in this age is greatest in South Asia, Asia Pacific and Africa.   WHO refers the 'hard of hearing' to those people who have hearing loss ranging from mild to severe. These people can get benefit from hearing aids, cochlear implants and other assistive devices.   However, those patients including children and adult who are having significant or profound hearing losses can be only benefitted from cochlear implant surgery.   "Cochlear implant is a gold standard surgery for children who are profoundly deaf (hearing loss more than 90 decibel). The earliest this device is implanted, the sooner a child can hear and speak", said Dr Sanjay Khanna who has performed the first cochlear implant surgery of Panchkula in a four-year- old child at Paras Hospital, Panchkula.   Dr Sanjay Khanna has wide exposure and expertise in cochlear implant surgery and sleep apnea surgery.   He further enlightened that in a surgical procedure of three-four hours implant is placed inside the inner ear of the patient. After this implantation a child has to undergo speech therapy session for at least two years. With the help of this procedure deaf and dumb children can learn to hear and speak.   To diagnose if a child can hear or not, early hearing screening of new born is necessary. OAE, which is a basic hearing screening test, is performed to check whether a child can hear or not in future or the child is hearing impaired.   This test can be done after second day of the birth. In more advance countries like US, Europe and Australia more implants are being done in adult population as elderly patients are unable to understand speech despite the best quality hearing aids.   "Cochlear implant is an electronic device that provides sound signals from damaged or non-functioning part of inner ear to the brain. Cochlear implant has two parts, the first part is surgically implanted into the bone surrounding the ear which consists of a receiver stimulator that decodes and sends an electrical signal to the brain. The second part is an outside device which is made up of a microphone or receiver, speech processor, and an antenna. This part receives the sound, converts it into an electrical signal and sends it to the inside part of the cochlear implant', said Dr Sanjay Khanna who gave an insight on this device.   Dr. Sanjay Khanna said that in Haryana more than 115,000 people have some form of hearing loss and this number is increasing. To check the increase in number of children going undetected and subsequently crossing the appropriate age for treatment, a Universal Newborn Hearing Screening (UNHS) program is urgently needed in Haryana.   Paras Hospital, Panchkula has all facilities for early diagnosis, intervention and habilitation for children identified with various forms of hearing loss.   "In India, four in every 1000 children suffer from severe to profound hearing loss, with over 100,000 babies born with hearing deficiency every year. The estimated prevalence of adult-onset deafness in India is 7.6 per cent and childhood onset deafness 2 per cent, according to Union Health Ministry. Hearing disability is the second most common cause of disability in India", said Ashish Chadha, Facility Director, Paras Hospital, Panchkula.   This story is provided by PRNewswire.

With promotion back to the Premier League available for two sides who suffered the ignominy of relegation last year, there was palpable tension around the ground.
 And that manifested itself in a drab encounter where both teams opted for a safety-first approach.
 Wigan's Marc-Antoine Fortune had the only chance of note, blazing over midway through the second half, and the sides will meet again at Loftus Road on Monday with a place at Wembley still very much up for grabs.
 It was the hosts who looked the more likely in the early stages, although chances were few and far between after QPR keeper Rob Green comfortably saved Gary Caldwell's header.
 Their dominance in possession did almost bring reward just before the break, Green producing a fine save to keep out Jordi Gomez's powerful, low effort.
 Whatever QPR boss Harry Redknapp said to his players at half-time seemed to have an impact as his team came out after the break with added verve.
 Yet, as was the case with their opponents in the opening period, control of the game did not yield openings with Wigan defending resolutely.
 In fact, it was Uwe Rosler's side who created the next chance.
 After QPR failed to clear their lines on multiple occasions from a corner, Robert Kiernan sent a vicious pass across the box but Fortune turned the ball just over.
 Rocked into action, Redknapp responded with a positive substitution, replacing defender Armand Traore with striker Kevin Doyle.
 But that failed to have an immediate impact and the withdrawal of attacking midfielder Ravel Morrison soon after suggested a change in tact.
 Indeed, there was a sense of both sides settling for the result, although Wigan did have a good penalty appeal turned down when Clint Hill appeared to have fouled Kiernan.
 It was not given, though, leaving matters intriguingly poised ahead of the second leg.

_La Roja_ had only the 1964 European Championships to their name prior to 2008, but since then they have dominated the international scene by lifting two Euro crowns as well as the World Cup in South Africa four years ago.
 Vicente del Bosque’s side head to Brazil looking to retain the trophy and secure a fourth straight tournament win, and Barcelona star Fabregas insists he is as hungry as ever to taste glory in the red shirt.
 In an interview with himself to mark the launch of PUMA’s Tricks boot, Cesc said:
 “You never get bored of winning. Everyone always wants to strive for the best and for a footballer the World Cup is the best thing that can happen to you.
 “Until 2008 nobody believed in us and since then we've made a name for ourselves and we've become a competitive team that has won everything.”
 Spain triumphed in 2010 despite slipping up in their opening group game against Switzerland, and a trickier test awaits in Salvador on June 13 as the champions kick off against the Netherlands – runners-up four years ago.
 Cesc believes the Swiss upset will help focus the minds ahead of Spain's curtain-raisier against the Dutch, who Fabregas expects ‘will be dying’ to exact revenge for their Johannesburg heartache.
 “I think it will be an interesting game. But of course everyone will be thinking back to that final and what happened. It was a very competitive final, a passionate and exciting game. I'm sure they'll be dying to get one over on us.
 “[Losing to Switzerland] was a difficult time and I remember we were all very nervous. Everyone thought it was the easiest game in the group but that just shows you that any World Cup or European Championships are never easy. That was a lesson and we should remember it ahead of this World Cup too.”

UNDATED (AP) — The Dallas Cowboys can say cornerback and defensive end are their two biggest needs in the draft because those were their two biggest losses in free agency. Dallas is back in the first-round business with the 17th overall pick. The Cowboys sat out opening night a year ago after sending their first-rounder to Oakland in a 2018 midseason trade for receiver Amari Cooper. The possibilities for that pick could include Florida cornerback CJ Henderson and LSU edge rusher K’Lavon Chaisson.UNDATED (AP) — The PGA Tour is laying out an ambitious plan to resume its season. The tour said Thursday that it plans to restart its season at Colonial in Texas on June 11-14. That would be the start of a PGA Tour event every week through the first of December, except for a Thanksgiving break. But that still hinges on getting a green light from government and health authorities that golf can be played in a safe manner to avoid spreading the new coronavirus. At least the first four tournaments would not have fans. Meanwhile, the Canadian Open was added to the list of canceled events.UNDATED (AP) — The suspension of play in the NHL because of the coronavirus pandemic has put Tom Fitzgerald of the New Jersey Devils in limbo. The 51-year-old is waiting to see if the league will finish its season and also if he still has a job. Fitzgerald is the league's only interim general manager. He took over Jan. 12, when Ray Shero was fired, and guided the Devils to a 12-8-5 record. Five coaches are also limbo. Geoff Ward of Calgary, Alain Nasreddine of the Devils, Rick Bowness of Dallas, Bob Boughner of San Jose and Dean Evason of MinnesotaLUBBOCK, Texas (AP) — Jamarius Burton has signed with Texas Tech after starting 52 games the past two seasons at Wichita State. The 6-foot-4 guard will have two seasons of eligibility remaining with the Red Raiders. Burton averaged 10.3 points and 3.4 assists per game as a sophomore at Wichita State. Burton could be eligible to play next season for the Red Raiders if the NCAA adopts a proposed change to allow Division I athletes to transfer once without sitting out a season.CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. (AP) — Virginia men's basketball coach Tony Bennett says Trey Murphy III has joined the Cavaliers as a transfer from Rice. The Durham, North Carolina native will be eligible to practice next season, but will have to wait a year before he can play. He will have two years of eligibility remaining. At Rice, the 6-foot-8 Murphy averaged 13.7 points as a sophomore and made 75 3-pointers.WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (AP) — Wake Forest men's basketball is adding transfer help. The Demon Deacons announced Thursday that Ian DuBose would play next year as a graduate transfer from Houston Baptist. DuBose averaged 19 points to lead the Southland Conference last season. In addition, Virginia Tech sophomore Isaiah Wilkins announced in a social-media post that he would transfer to play for the Demon Deacons in his hometown of Winston-Salem. It’s unclear if he must sit a year due to NCAA rules or could receive a waiver to play immediately.NEW YORK (AP) — It will be no surprise if Oregon star Sabrina Ionescu is the No. 1 pick in the WNBA draft by the New York Liberty. It would be a surprise, however, if she isn't. The Ducks guard, who was the consensus player of the year, has been projected as the Liberty’s choice since the team won the draft lottery. Her teammate Satou Sabally, one of three juniors to forego their last year of college eligibility and enter the draft, is expected to go No. 2 to Dallas. It would be the third time in the history of the draft that the top two picks came from the same program.

Custom made and decorated sugar cookies are bringing smiles along with a sweet note of positivity to the area during the coronavirus pandemic.
 Rebekah Schenewark owns the Rebekah Schenewark Farmers Insurance Agency in Sedalia as well as The Farmhouse Cookie Co. Schenewark, of Lincoln, opened her cookie company in January 2019 and then opened the insurance company in the summer of 2019.
 She said by phone Thursday, once she opened the insurance company her husband, Jason, and daughter Audrey began helping her make and deliver the custom sugar cookies. All was going well; then the COVID-19 virus changed American life.
 Undaunted, Schenewark began conducting insurance services from home, but also decided to create a DIY cookie kit for those who were also stuck at home due to the pandemic. Her family stepped in to help with the project.
 “My husband actually does all the baking,” she said. “He mixes the dough, rolls it out, cuts it out and bakes.
 “My teenage daughter mixes all the royal icing from scratch, flavors it, and colors it and puts it in bags for me,” she continued. “Then I do the decorating.”
 She added they are still creating custom cookie orders plus providing the kits.
 “When people have been home all day, they have been looking for things to do,” she said. “So, we thought up the DIY kit and those have been really successful. Then we’re also going to be doing a paint-your-own-cookie kit.
 “That will be our next project,” she added. “I’m also doing kits that people can buy for friends and have them delivered.”
 Since the pandemic began, the family has produced 110 DIY cookie kits.
 “Every kit has half a dozen baked cookies and then four bags of icing and some sprinkles,” Schenewark said.
 The custom-made sugar cookies come in all shapes and sizes.
 “We do all sorts of shapes, I have so many cookie cutters you wouldn’t believe it,” Schenewark said. “I have cookie cutters and stencils running out my ears.
 “We also just added a 3D printer,” she continued. “So, now we can 3D print our own cookie cutters. So, if somebody has an idea that they want done and we don’t have a cutter for it, we can make it here at home.”
 Schenewark’s cookies are becoming popular on The Farmhouse Cookie Co. Facebook page. The page already has 1,300 followers.
 “People just find me on there and either leave comments on the cookies I’ve posted or if they have a custom order then they’ll send me a private message,” she explained.
 The family offers porch pick up for those who live in the Lincoln area and Schenewark said they also make afternoon deliveries to the Sedalia area.
 Those interested in The Farmhouse Cookie Co. kits or custom cookie orders may contact Schenewark at 573-823-0911 or by visiting facebook.com/TheFarmhouseCookieCo.

Lee Clark's side occupy the last relegation spot in the second tier of English football and must avoid defeat at Bolton Wanderers on Saturday to have any chance of staying up.
 After slumping to five straight league defeats, Birmingham will have to rise to the occasion when it matters most and the Midlands outfit may be glad of an away fixture, having only won twice at St Andrews this season in the league.
 Despite their perilous position, Clark is confident his side can clinch all three points at the Reebok Stadium and avoid a second relegation in three years - particularly given that they have secured nine Championship victories on their travels in the current campaign.
 "Yes (we can avoid relegation), definitely, because our away form has been very good," he said. "It's imperative we get a result on Saturday."
 Yeovil Town and Barnsley have already been consigned to League One and one of four teams will join them after an intriguing final round of fixtures, although Blackpool appear to be all-but safe.
 Paul Dickov takes his Doncaster Rovers side to his former club Leicester City knowing a defeat will send them down if Birmingham secure at least a point, as Clark's men have a better goal difference.
 Leicester already have the title wrapped up, but Nigel Pearson's men can still reach 100 points and will be eager to sign off in style at the King Power Stadium and possibly send Rovers straight back down to the third tier.
 Millwall are two points better off than Birmingham with a vastly inferior goal difference, but three points at home to Bournemouth will ensure Ian Holloway's side are safe, while a draw would be enough for Blackpool at home to Charlton Athletic - who secured their Championship status by beating Watford 3-1 on Tuesday.
 There is also one play-off spot up for grabs on Saturday, with Reading needing three points against Premier League-bound Burnley at the Madejski Stadium to assure they will take sixth spot.
 Waiting to pounce on any Reading slip-up are seventh-placed Brighton and Hove Albion, with Oscar Garcia's men - who are a point behind Nigel Adkins' side - aiming to extend their season by beating Nottingham Forest at the City Ground.
 If Brighton secure a point and Reading lose, then the south-coast club will also sneak into the play-offs and face Derby County.
 Blackburn Rovers remain within mathematical reach of the top six, but need Reading to lose and Brighton not to win, as well as a seven-goal swing, as they attempt to secure a victory at Wigan Althletic - who have already sealed a play-off spot.
 Barnsley and Yeovil will bow out of the league in home matches against QPR and Middlesbrough respectively, while Sheffield Wednesday and Huddersfield Town hit the road to face Ipswich Town and Watford.
 Steve McClaren's Derby look to maintain their momentum for the play-offs against Leeds United at Elland Road, and will be confident of doing so having won their last 10 games against the Yorkshire club.
