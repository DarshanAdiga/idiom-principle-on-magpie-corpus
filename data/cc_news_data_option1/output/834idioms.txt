PEORIA, Ariz. – The mere mention of it should elicit a reaction, most likely negative. But there is no violent twitching of his eye or a facial tic. A gag reflex isn’t an immediate response. Whether he knows it or not, Scott Servais does develop a pained look on his face when the situation is relived, even as a humorous anecdote. It’s the same look he made when one of the them would boot a routine groundball or a spray an otherwise simple throw well off-line of the target.


  When the Mariners opened the 2019 season vs. the Oakland A’s at the Tokyo Dome, the starting lineup featured an infield of Jay Bruce at first base, Dee Gordon at second base, Ryon Healy at third base and Tim Beckham at shortstop.


  That wasn’t a good defense on paper. And on the field, it somehow looked worse. Not even Gordon’s superior range and athleticism could offset what was around him.

On Friday night, Chanticleer filled every nook and cranny of Mechanics Hall for, much to the audience's delight and privilege, the first time in the vocal ensemble's entire 42-year history. Riding the wave of a reputation that magnificently preceded them, and under the gracious sponsorship of Music Worcester, they brought in tow a program more than worthy of its name.
 Called "Trade Winds," it spanned the gamut from the Renaissance madrigals of Italian choral giants Claudio Monteverdi and Carlo Gesualdo to a dedication by living Chinese-American composer Zhou Tian. Between these temporal pillars the 12 men of Chanticleer strung a vast array of sonic garlands, each more disparate than the last. That said, it was impossible to ignore underlying themes that brought into focus a coherent and deeply considered mosaic of selections from around the world.
 From Monteverdi's setting of Petrarch they unfolded a decidedly lovelorn panoply of words images, and melodic lines. With descriptive touches that were as indicative of the composer as of the bonded singers gifting them to us, the singing gleamed as if illuminated from within. In Gesualdo, too, they found a kindred creative spirit whose originality was as disruptive as it was alluring. These centuries-old pieces were sung with a great and genuine joy that lasted through to the end.
 The second of the program's seven numbered sections yielded one of the most heavenly turns of the concert from a composer not often associated with choral repertoires: Edvard Grieg. Not only was his Ave maris stella lush in its harmonic language, it also opened itself like a morning glory in the dawn, so that by its end we knew that daylight was here to stay. Another setting of that same Latin text, this one by Tomas Luis de Victoria, followed with a dialogue of chant and polyphony that felt as much of the present as of the past.
 After the finely wrought puzzle of the Missa O Soberana Luz by Filipe de Magalhaes, the "title track" as it were came to the foreground. Tian's Trade Winds was a setting of three distinct poems, of which the final by Seth Michelson felt best suited to the composer's postmodern sensibilities. Next was a smattering of engagingly reworked folk songs in Chinese, Māori and Korean. Of these, the latter was an especially moving example of how the most straightforward singing can go straight to the heart.
 Deeply affecting, too, was the smattering of sea shanties that came next and which included two arranged by Gustav Holst. Telling the story of a young woman, Nancy, whose lover sets off to sea, they gave us two sides of her grief. Holst's broader, though no less precise, brushstrokes were a refreshing change of tone and cleansed the proverbial palate for Irving Berlin's "Blue Skies" and the traditional spiritual, "(Everywhere I Go) Somebody Talkin' 'bout Jesus." The uplift in those last words felt like the greatest of comforts when such divine concerns seem to have fallen by the wayside, silenced by the muzzle of secular unrest.

In this writer’s opinion, like some other countries, today’s India cries out for more devolution and decentralisation. India might be too big a country to have one capital, and that too Delhi, an old feudal ‘city’ with the culture of a durbar. The capital of India had not even public transport of any quality till the onset of the last decade. A place that is so confused about its own identity. Is it a state? Is it a city? Is it a region? Is it all these things at once? This muddled status makes it easy to manoeuvre power as any authority can pass the buck of responsibility. In the process, Delhi’s poor and weak labouring class are putty in State hands. For the sake of its harrowed people, ending its status as national capital, might not be a bad idea. But before that, who will get them justice?

Emerging requirements of customers for products offering similar level of performance and quality requirements is one of the key factors encouraging manufacturers of bio based pigments and dyes for diversifying their product lines. Increasing propensity for environmentally responsible products is also pushing the adoption of bio based pigments and dyes. An overarching trend pointing toward rising utilization of sustainable products has become highly evident than ever, creating favorable circumstances for growing adoption of bio based pigments and dyes. Bio based pigments and dyes, on the back of their characteristic of low and very low VOC emissions, are gaining persistent support by governmental and other prominent organizations. This, in turn, is likely to boost the adoption rate of bio based pigments and dyes by a significant margin.

  On Friday, the states of Washington and Oregon also announced new coronavirus cases in people who hadn’t recently traveled overseas or been exposed to other confirmed cases.


  In Oregon, an employee of a Washington County _elementary school was diagnosed_ after first experiencing symptoms Feb. 19 and may have exposed others at the school to the virus, officials said.

At a family gathering last summer, my wife's mom asked me to cook some meat from a deer that my father-in-law had shot. It was his first, and nobody seemed to know exactly what to do with it. The flesh of said deer resided in a cache of unlabeled Ziplocs in a chest freezer in the basement.      Chances are, every meat eater -- even those without ties to the hunting community -- has encountered a frozen hunk of mystery meat in the back of the freezer. Nobody wants meat to spoil. The resources, carbon emissions and death behind that meat make it precious. And while we may want to use that meat, we don't want to invest time and energy into a meal that nobody will care to eat.      How to properly freeze   Meat can definitely spoil in the freezer if it isn't properly processed and sealed, but there is nothing intrinsically wrong with long-frozen meat. In fact, the texture of meat can actually improve in the freezer, as tough chunks will soften with time.      The notion that meat can survive, much less thrive, in the freezer flies in the face of the belief that fresh meat is better. Wendy's hamburger restaurants make a big deal of their burger meat being 100% fresh. But raw meat is rotting meat. If you really want to keep red meat fresh for more than a few days, freeze it.      When you freeze meat, wrap it tightly in plastic. You don't want to leave any air pockets next to the meat, or they will fill with frost and cause freezer burn. If you don't have a vacuum sealer, plastic wrap will cling very tightly to meat.   If you then wrap the plastic-wrapped meat in butcher paper, shiny-side in, the meat should stay in pristine shape for well over a year.      And that bright white butcher paper practically begs to be drawn on with a sharpie. My son likes to draw pictures of the animal inside. The cook, of course, prefers meat labeled with all of the relevant information, like what kind of animal, which part and when it was packed.      Luckily, for those times when we are cooking blind, we have the mystery meat techniques, time-tested ways of assessing and preparing meat of uncertain age and origin. They aren't that complicated, and will give you the confidence you need to go in there and solve the mystery of the next piece of random meat you encounter.      How to cook   The first step is to thaw the meat slowly, still wrapped, to what's called the "sherbet" stage, where the surface is soft but not thawed, and the inner core is still solid, but softenening.      With a long, thin, sharp knife -- a filet knife, ideally -- trim the outside of the meat. Think of it like skinning an orange with a knife -- you want the peel gone, but you don't want to cut into the flesh beneath it. In the case of mystery meat -- as well as poorly sealed meat of known provenance -- that "peel" is a greyish layer of oxidized flesh. Keep trimming until the surface of your meat hunk is completely red, with no splotches of brown, grey or green. You may have to dig deeper near freezer-burned areas.      As you slice, make note of the musculature that is revealed. Is it smooth, uninterrupted muscle flesh, or is it crisscrossed with connective tissue?      When the surface of the meat is clean, slice off a thin piece -- less than ½-inch -- and do some analysis in the pan. Heat some oil, add salt and pepper, and cook the piece of meat on both sides. While you're at it, open a bottle of wine for proper enjoyment.      If, upon tasting this morsel you are like "WANT MOAR," then you are good to go. If your mouth has reservations, then you might need to pay attention.      It's possible for a piece of meat to taste good but to also have off-flavors. And it's easy to temporarily convince yourself that the good flavors outweigh the bad. You can mask flavor to a certain extent with spices, marinades and sauces, but ultimately a piece of mystery meat is not worth getting sick over. Trust your gut. If it doesn't taste right in any way, don't take the risk.      Truly bad meat is a lot more likely in the case of wild mystery meat. An outdoor hunt presents a whole new set of variables, like temperature, manner of death and how the animal was processed into meat. On the other hand, meat that was processed in a USDA inspected facility doesn't face those variables and should be fine -- unless it spoiled at home before you froze it, or something like that.   Assuming you have good meat beneath that oxidized peel, the pan test will also help you determine how chewable it is.      If it's tender, cut the sherbet meat into little cubes -- half-frozen meat is easy to cut. Cook the cubes in oil, with salt and pepper, and let them slowly build a crusty shell of brown armor.      You'll want to just shovel these browned cubes into your mouth and wash them down with wine. Or use them in tacos or fried rice.      If the meat is tough you will have to melt it, with an oven braise or in the slow cooker. Cook at 300 in water and wine, covered, until soft, which could take six to eight hours. With tough cuts that have been braised into submission, make stew or pulled meat sandwiches.

We know the ideological moorings of the majority party in power at the Centre. Over the last months, as their election campaign bruised apace, Arvind Kejriwal seemed wary to keep away from the citizenship agitations and focus on the highlights of his tenure. The AAP won hands down, but there is no doubt that extremist inflaming shored up BJP’s vote share. Through large parts of Delhi’s Hindu worlds, there is a proclivity for Hindutva. Essentially, the public discourse framework is such that no opponent of the current Union government must be perceived as being concerned for non-Hindus. For a party that voted against the CAA in Parliament, why have Kejriwal and the AAP been careful about confronting it in public? And, what does this say about their commitment to constitutional values in practice?

He was charged Feb. 4 in the fatal shootings of two people and wounding of a third two days earlier in River Rouge, southwest of Detroit. He was also suspected in a Jan. 8 killing in River Rouge, a Feb. 18 killing in Highland Park, and separate slayings on Feb. 21 and Feb. 22 in Detroit, as well as two carjackings in Detroit on Feb. 21.


  Despite numerous arrests and probation violations over the past few years, Brown was released from custody “at the behest of a federal law enforcement agency," David Ashenfelter, a spokesman for the U.S. District Court in Detroit, told The Detroit News this week. The agency was not named.


  That revelation raised questions about whether Brown should have been in custody when the slayings occurred in January and February.


  U.S. Attorney Matthew Schneider said Thursday that his office has found no evidence that a federal agency asked a judge to release Brown months before he was charged in the two Detroit-area slayings and named a suspect in at least four others. Schneider said his office was working to get to the bottom of the matter.

While most Afghans want peace, not everyone is convinced by this latest attempt.
 "I'm sceptical about the whole peace process," says Hameed Miakhel, a resident of Jalalabad. "Everything has happened behind closed doors, and that makes every Afghan suspicious. I am not sure this agreement will bear fruit."
 That's contrasted by people like Najibullah Elham, from Kabul, who says he is cautiously optimistic.
 "The period of reduction in violence proved that it is possible to end this war," he says. "But it will take immense commitment for the Afghan government and the Taliban to work on the mechanisms of peace."
 So far the Taliban insist on an "Islamic" government and reject the current constitution. But they say they will allow women to work within an "Islamic framework".
 The challenges ahead are formidable. There is hope, but scepticism runs deeper.

The renewed bull run in mid- and small-cap shares has come to an abrupt halt. The selloff in the stock market in the last one week triggered by a global spread of coronavirus has resulted in these shares giving up all their gains of 2020. The broader markets fell in line with the slump in the main benchmarks on Friday. The BSE Mid-Cap index ended down 3.13 per cent at 14600.02 and is now down 2.45 per cent since January. The BSE SmallCap index also fell in the red for the year 2020 intraday on Friday. The index ended down 3.5 per cent at 13709.01 and is up 0.1 per cent for the year. The BSE 500 index is down 6.6 per cent for the year. In what has been the worst week for benchmark indices in over a decade, many mid- and small-cap stocks have declined in double digits. Adani Transmission, Jindal Steel and L&T; Finance Holdings fell 19-22 per cent in the week ended Friday. Small-cap index constituents such as Future Consumer, Tejas Networks and Adani Gas fell 28-40 per cent. 74411204 Market strategists said the midand small-cap indices were gaining in January after being beaten down since January 2018 but the risk- averse sentiment in global markets has prompted investors to pull out of these segments and move to safe havens such as debt and gold. The broader market gains were anyway suspect as India’s economic growth has been slowing down. “The mid- and small-cap stocks were struggling because of the economic downturn in India. Now, investors are taking a risk-off stance and they want to reduce exposure to risky assets, which means their appetite to hold equities is lower,” said Sanjeev Prasad, co-head, Kotak Institutional Equities. “Their appetite to hold riskier mid- and small-cap companies is even lower. They would still want to own some of the large-caps and better quality names,” said Prasad. The mid- and small-cap indices are still marginally up in the last one year but are down 20-30 per cent from their all-time peaks they hit in January 2018. The BSE Mid-cap index had hit a record high of 18321.37 on January 9, 2018 and the BSE Small-cap index had touched a lifetime high of 20183.45 on January 15, 2018. 74375213 Market strategists believe that the broader market will continue to weaken as the appetite for equity wanes until there is clarity on the extent to which coronavirus is likely to weigh on global growth. “This is a completely globalised trend as all major markets have corrected by the same magnitude. While it is anybody’s guess how the coronavirus impact plays out, we may see some stability in the main index as it has corrected by 9-10 per cent but global news flow and FII selling have to stabilise first,” said Rajat Rajgarhia, CEO-institutional equities at Motilal Oswal. “Benchmark indices have to stabilise first for the broader market to see calm,” said Rajgarhia.

Telangana State Council of Higher Education Vice Chairman V.Venkata Ramana on Saturday said a State-wide portal to facilitate internships for students is on the cards.
 “We are shortly going to launch a State-wide Telangana portal for internship,” he said, adding the objective is to help improve access to internships for engineering students from tier II and III locations.
 “A boy or girl from Adilabad, Warangal or somewhere in Nirmal can apply for the internships,” he told ‘Startup Connect 2020’ organised here by the Indian Chamber of Commerce (ICC). For the companies, the portal would translate into more choices, he pointed out.
 Mr. Ramana said this listing measures taken by Telangana government to update the curriculum to make it more relevant for the industry. He highlighted the various initiatives of the government to promote start-ups, the ecosystem for them and to encourage innovation. The State was keen to promote start-ups working in the areas of emerging technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) and social enterprises.
 Addressing the meeting, SEBI Chief General Manager Jeevan Sonparote said the regulator is open to stakeholder feedback on ways to facilitate the start-up ecosystem regarding issues of raising capital.
 Ramesh Loganathan, Professor of Practice and Co-Innovations, IIIT-Hyderabad stressed the need for start-ups to connect with corporates as well as industry associations for open innovation and co-creation.
 Southern Council Member of ICC Rajiv Reddy said mentorship remains at the core of the start-up ecosystem and ICC had taken the onus of hand-holding start-ups through its pan India initiative “ICC Nexxt” which facilitates, policy advocacy, open innovation and start-up investment.

TORONTO – Canada has been helping London's Metropolitan Police provide security to Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan, "intermittently" since November, officials acknowledged Thursday for the first time – but the assistance will stop in the "coming weeks" as the couple step back from their roles as senior royals.
 The Duke and Duchess of Sussex announced last month that they intend to cut most of their ties to the royal family, to pursue financial independence and to live at least part time in Canada. The couple and their infant son, Archie, have been staying at a secluded $14 million mansion in a gated community on Vancouver Island, where they spent their Christmas holidays.
 Canadians have been largely indifferent to the arrival of the royal couple. But Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government has faced repeated questions about who will foot the bill for the family's security.
 It had offered little in the way of details until Thursday.
 "The Duke and Duchess of Sussex choosing to relocate to Canada on a part-time basis presented our government with a unique and unprecedented set of circumstances," the office of Public Safety Minister Bill Blair said in a statement. "The (Royal Canadian Mounted Police) has been engaged with officials in the U.K. from the very beginning regarding security. As the Duke and Duchess are currently recognized as Internationally Protected Persons, Canada has an obligation to provide security assistance on an as-needed basis."
 Harry and Meghan are slated to scale back their official duties on March 31. After protracted negotiations with Buckingham Palace, the couple agreed last week to abandon the "Sussex Royal" branding they have used to promote their online presence and to withdraw any trademark applications on the name.
 "In keeping with their change in status," Blair's office said, the security assistance will "cease in the coming weeks."
 While the announcement was likely to be cheered by Canadians, it appeared to contradict previous statements by Blair about the family's security and who is paying for it.
 He told reporters at a Liberal Party Cabinet retreat in Winnipeg last month that the Royal Canadian Mounted Police was "not engaged" in providing security services for the royal family "right now."
 On Thursday, Blair said "that was the information I had at the time." But following "subsequent discussions" with the Metropolitan Police, he said, the RCMP have been "intermittently assisting" in providing security.
 Public opinion surveys show Canadians are strongly opposed to being on the hook for Harry and Meghan's security.
 More than half of those surveyed by the Leger polling firm last month said they were "indifferent" to the family's move. But nearly 70% said the couple, not Canadian taxpayers, should be responsible for covering their security costs.
 An online petition from the Canadian Taxpayers Federation calling on Trudeau to ensure that taxpayer money not be used to support the couple picked up more than 120,000 signatures.
 Aaron Wudrick, federal director of the organization, called the announcement Thursday a "tremendous victory for Canadian taxpayers."
 "The Trudeau government is doing the right thing," he said. "Canadians were unequivocal that the Duke and Duchess are welcome here, but that they need to pay their own way."
 The couple plan to close their office in Buckingham Palace next month and have said they plan to start a nonprofit organization this spring as they map out their nontraditional future.
 But questions remain about what that will look like, including where in Canada they will settle. Meghan has made a handful of surprise visits to charities in Vancouver.
 Lawyers for the couple threatened legal action last month against British reporters who they claim snapped photos of Meghan walking with Archie and the family dogs while lurking in the bushes. The Daily Mail posted photos and a video that dissected Meghan's baby-holding technique.
 Neighbors have been more protective, opting to give the family the privacy it wants.
 At least one member of the family is enjoying the new surroundings.
 Archie has witnessed his first snowfall, Harry said at a charity event in London last month – and "thought it was bloody brilliant."

The canola oil usage has been rising since past few years. Owing to its increased demand, the production of canola oil has risen tremendously. The canola oil market witnesses a good growth pattern owing to several aspects which are responsible for driving the progress ratio. The benefits of canola oil are tremendous, especially for heart ailments. The omega 3 and omega 6 fatty acids present in the canola oil facilitate good heart health. Owing to this important aspect, a majority of population across different regions are preferring canola oil in their day to day usage. The main factor fuelling the canola oil market growth is the fattening awareness about canola oil benefits. It also helps in lowering bad cholesterol without altering the good cholesterol. Cosmetic application is another important factor, as canola oil is largely used in cosmetics owing to the benefits it provides. Certain body lotions are also prepared which contain canola oil. It provides anti-aging properties and is used to control wrinkles, acne, blemishes as well as fine lines. However, the higher pricing of canola oil along with soya bean which is a substitute to canola oil and is readily available, can challenge the growth of the canola oil market. The global canola oil market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 3.2% over the period of forecast, 2017 to 2022.

Three persons testing positive for COVID-19 and declaration of the epidemic a “State calamity’ by the government have come as a bolt from the blue for the tourism industry. It came when the industry was on the recovery path after Cyclone Ockhi, Nipah outbreak, and floods in the past three years.
 Though the government withdrew the calamity warning within five days and the scare that gripped the State is gradually dying down, tourism, one of the fast-growing sectors in Kerala, is at the crossroads.
 With COVID-19 spreading to Europe, Middle East, and Latin America, holidayers, both domestic and international, have preferred to keep away from the destination and leisure tourism has almost been wiped off. There has been no recovery from the mass cancellations that poured into the reservation desks of hotels and resorts in the first week of February as soon as reports of positive cases came in.

Two actors stood out in particular, the first being Caitlin Doyle who played Aunt March and Mrs Kirk. With impeccable comedic timing and a complete physical and vocal transformation between characters, Doyle had the audience in fits of laughter and totally enthralled by her performance. Playing Jo March, Tally Soames was utterly captivating, while some may be tempted to compare her performance to the many Jos that have come before her, Soames managed to bring new vigour and excitement to the role that leads the audience so expertly through every high and low the spirited tomboy experienced. Soames also stunned us with her powerhouse vocals, each song was performed with such clarity and control, I was astonished from the moment she opened her mouth. However, Jo would be nothing without her loved ones, and the rest of the March family/Laurence clan did not disappoint. With equally as charming performances and strong vocals, the cast and ensemble together created an atmosphere of such fun, it truly felt like I was watching a family grow together.

When a male general came to inspect the unit, Adams prevented him from viewing the women’s private rooms while some of them were sleeping. After headquarters and off-duty personnel of the unit were assembled in a formation as instructed, the general chastised Adams for not having all her troops present. When Adams attempted to explain that the women worked three different shifts and that she followed the orders she was given, the general cut her off and threatened to send a “white first lieutenant” to show her how to command the unit. Adams’ famous reply, “Over my dead body, Sir,” nearly earned her a court-martial, but the general was subsequently dissuaded from taking that course of action.

"It seems like we get in this position, and it's all by yourselves, but we've got to be able to string them together here and find some good mojo and lock that in," veteran guard Patty Mills said Friday after practice.
 While Wednesday night's 109-103 home loss to Dallas dropped them nine games below .500, the Silver and Black (24-33) trail Memphis (28-31) by only three games for the eighth and final playoff spot in the Western Conference standings.
 Based on the winning percentage of their opponents, the Grizzlies have the league's toughest schedule in the season's stretch run. Memphis has lost two straight since San Antonio fell to Dallas.
 Still, the Spurs trail No. 9 New Orleans (26-33), No. 10 Portland (26-24) and No. 11 Sacramento (25-34).
 The Silver and Black, who continue their three-game homestand Saturday night against Orlando, need wins against the Magic and then Indiana on Monday to gain some traction going into a three-game road trip next week.

While there is never a good time for an outbreak of any virus, the COVID-19 outbreaks in Japan and Korea and their subsequent impact to Guam tourism comes on the heels of a planned increase to the island's minimum wage: a one-two punch some businesses say will hit them hard.
 In March, the minimum wage will be raised from $8.25 to $8.75 for about 3,500 workers locally. Just days ago, an estimated 20,000 would-be visitors canceled their trips to Guam, amounting to a loss of more than $9 million to the island’s tourism industry. That number has increased to 30,000 visitors.
 The double whammy of less business and higher wages is leaving some worried about their bottom line for the coming months.
 The Guam Chamber of Commerce asked Gov. Lou Leon Guerrero to hold off on the wage hike, but she said the raise will move forward as planned.
 “I want it to be held off as well,” said a business owner who asked for only his first name, Nathan, to be used.
 He said sales are down and the impending wage hike is going to mean that much more of a struggle.
 “Business has been a little slow,” he said. “We had expectations for this month, but it’s not really happening. If we increase the minimum wage, of course we will have to cut hours, so our staff members will have to have shorter hours and it will affect them with their bills."
 He said it's not just his business that will suffer.
 “Oh, definitely this is going to hurt all businesses," he said. “Businesses just can’t afford to pay the overhead."
 He said the hike comes at a bad time and could have a negative impact on businesses across the island.
 “Their sales are being affected by tourism, less customers coming through. There is not a lot of spending in retail stores, there is not a lot of eating out,” he said.
 “It’s very slow in the tourism industry now,” said Yigo resident John Valencia, who works at a local tour company.
 Valencia is of two minds when it comes the minimum wage hike and the COVID-19 scare keeping visitors at bay.
 “I think it’s a good thing because everything on Guam is getting more expensive, so minimum (wage) should go up more,” he said of the wage hike.
 And while the lack of tourists is impacting the industry he works in, he said, maybe less people coming to the island has a positive aspect.
 “It’s a good thing because we don’t want it to spread around the island,” Valencia said.
 He said he is taking precautions while on the job.
 “I have to always wear a mask,” he said.
 But there is little consumers can do to protect themselves from a higher cost for goods and services, according to Jay Cruz, 25, of Toto.
 “All I know is that once minimum wage goes up, everything else goes up. It’s deserved, but that does not mean the cost of everything won’t go up too,” he said.
 "Most of our customers are tourists," said Leonor Patricio, who works at a kiosk that sells mainly Zippo lighters – a favorite with many visitors from Asian countries.
 She said that since the island's decline in visitors began, some days her store has no sales at all. "It's very, very slow," she said.
 An increase in the minimum wage can be survived, she said, but she does not know if her business can survive in the coming months it will take to recover after the outbreak.
 "The minimum wage – if they raise it, it's OK, we can handle it. But if it's like this every day – no tourists – maybe we will shut down the store," Patricio.
 Evangeline Delambaca, a supervisor at Levi's Outlet at the Guam Premier Outlets, said Levi's should be able to weather the storm during the COVID-19 outbreak and still manage to give employees an increase in wages needed to keep up with the island's rising cost of living.
 "It really affects us because we have less customers and less sales every day, and then also the raise. But we do support the raise of minimum wage," she said. "Especially for the employees who have been here many years and still make the same wage."
 Although the Guam branch of South Korea's largest tour agency, Hana Tour, has predicted arrivals to remain low in the next couple of months, Delambaca is hopeful – as many others likely are – that the industry will rebound eventually.
 "It's just for now, maybe," she said. "It's just because of this virus, but hopefully it will be OK and we will have a lot of tourists again, and business will be OK."

Based on geographies, the global Calcined Alumina market is segmented into seven regions including North America, Latin America, Europe, CIS & Russia, Japan, APEJ (the Asia Pacific excluding Japan) and MEA. Among the above- mentioned countries, Asia Pacific excluding Japan is estimated to account for more than 40% of global consumption with major producers having their manufacturing facilities in the region. The region is also anticipated to witness a medium to high growth in the global Calcined Alumina market on the back of the emerging economies of India and China. These countries offer immense market potential for calcined alumina as the need for high quality steel would require more effective and efficient refractories offering higher performance, thereby consuming more quantities of calcined alumina. The paints & coatings application of calcined alumina is an emerging application for calcined alumina where it is used as a polishing agent for plastic, metal and glass. APEJ also accounts for a major market share in the global paints & coatings market. Moreover, North America followed by Europe are projected to showcase low to medium growth in the global Calcined Alumina market. Middle East & Africa and Latin America account for a mere single digit market share in terms of demand.

When I think about and celebrate Black History Month, I am often reminded of the first great Black Preacher I knew. His name was Rev. T. R. Singletary. He was pastor of three AME ZION CHURCHES in the Black Community. It was his practice to have Sunday Meals at the homes of members of the church. He was our Pastor at Sam Spring AME Zion church and he would often come to our house for his Sunday dinner after church. I looked so forward to him coming to our house because I knew we were going to have something special that day. After every meal, he would relax on our couch and have great conversations with my whole family. I will never forget that he told me I would be a preacher one day.

Accurate facts and history are under assault these days at every turn, from college campuses to Hollywood elites.


  One of the more fashionable, historical falsehoods showed up front and center in an advertisement starring actress Janelle Monae during this year’s Oscars, endorsing the premise that America’s true founding was not July 1776 but instead August 1619, when the first known slave boat arrived from Africa on America’s shores. Monae’s voice is one of many others lately seeking to stoke racial grievance between races rather than unite and uplift our country.


  In response to these troubling assertions, The Woodson Center in Washington launched “1776,” a coalition of scholars, grassroots leaders and advocates that challenges attempts to rewrite the founding of our nation as defined by slavery. The initiative provides an alternative perspective to the New York Times Magazine’s “1619 Project,” which aims to reframe our country’s history by claiming 1619 — the year enslaved Africans arrived in the English colony of Virginia — as the “true founding” of America.


  The central premise of “The 1619 Project” is that America is hopelessly racist and a “slavocracy” rather than a “democracy.” We in the “1776” coalition know that “The 1619 Project’s” premise is flawed, and the nation is in danger if the 1619 idea takes root.


  The Founding Fathers created a framework to empower all Americans, although, of course, this creed was not initially fulfilled. However, members of “1776” believe the founding documents contained the instruments of their own improvement (including the amendment process), thereby allowing a fulfillment of this creed for all Americans.


  This is why we believe that 1776 is indeed our nation’s true birthday. While we recognize slavery and discrimination are a tragic part of our nation’s history, through “1776” we choose to highlight America’s promise and to elevate the inspiring stories of blacks who rose and achieved and thrived — in spite of prejudice.


  We are bringing both scholars and grassroots together to speak to both head and heart. Our “1776” coalition is mobilizing ordinary Americans of all races to speak up and stand up for America through essays, videos and other educational materials. Together we explain the promise of America, celebrate the virtues of our founders and counter voices describing our nation’s birth as something other than 1776.


  Our “1776” coalition crosses political ideologies and includes Clarence Page, a progressive, Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist who is from the same hometown (Middletown, Ohio) as J.D. Vance, author of the book “Hillbilly Elegy.” Page’s father and Vance’s grandfather worked at the same saw mill, and Page has been struck by how many of today’s societal struggles cross lines of class as well as lines of race.


  Glenn Loury, an MIT-trained professor of economics at Brown University, is part of our “1776” coalition and offers his data-driven expertise in the state of black America. Our nationwide “1776” grassroots organizers are leaders uplifting people from poverty, reducing incarceration (for example, Jon Ponder, a Las Vegas leader who ministers to men in prison), breaking up gangs, rescuing women from prostitution and more. Their stories of redemption and restoration amplify the principles of our nation’s Founders.


  We believe that some within the black community have degraded Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s message of racial reconciliation and contorted it into a dystopian hopelessness. At “1776,” we choose instead to amplify voices of black achievement, forgotten historical figures who built their own thriving hospitals, schools and businesses when they were denied access to white establishments.


  Our “1776” consortium of top black academics, columnists, social service providers, business leaders and clergy from across American are committed to telling the complete history of America and black Americans from 1776 to present with a look to the future in answer to King’s famous question, “Where do we go from here?”


  We seek to offer alternative perspectives that celebrate the progress America has made on delivering its promise of equality and opportunity, and highlight the resilience of its people.


  We do this in the spirit of 1776, the date of America’s true founding.

Anything hit in the air wasn't going to go anywhere. The playing conditions weren't really conducive for an offensive night. Jacob Young had an exceptional night with three hits. We did just enough offensively, but we played really good defense. Give credit to their starter as well; he had a really good changeup going. We saw a kid behind him who's a senior, and we got the All-America closer Federman there at the end. All in all, it was a really, really good win for us, a win we should be able to build off of. But it's a long season. We've got a long way to go. We've got to get a little bit better offensively. We struck out 14 times tonight. We'll talk about that at breakfast."

Now is a great time to view the Missouri River. For best views, select a time in early afternoon when the sunlight brings out the eastern bank. Then you will get the full impact of the river rushing along at 4-7 mph as well as sandbars and otherwise hidden features on the eastern bank.


   


  Don't be surprised at the changes from one viewing to the next over a period of several weeks. Sandbars shift. You can easily see, especially with binoculars, the gradual and unrelenting erosion of the far bank. The river is widening even with the rock breaks which the Corps of Engineers constructed every 100 or so yards. The Big Muddy is making its way, sometimes without regard for boundaries, toward St. Louis and its rendezvous with its mighty river cousin, the Mississippi River.


   


  How long is the Missouri? The Missouri River Commission set its length at 2,285 miles. According to William Lass, author of "Navigating the Missouri," some of the measuring techniques were truly astounding and imaginative. One method was to use the length of a boat, select corresponding lengths on shore and keep track of the total number of lengths as the boat progressed upriver - awkward to say the least. The Encyclopedia Britannica sets the river's length as 2,315 miles and World Book Encyclopedia lists the Missouri as 2,540 miles, the longest river in the U.S.


   


  There are a number of dams upriver from Leavenworth. In 1944, Congress, with the Pick-Sloan Missouri Basin Program, authorized more than 60 small dams and six large dams, including the Fort Peck Dam near Glasgow, Montana, one of the largest earth-filled dams in the world, as flood control, electric power generation and irrigation. My sources did not mention controversy surrounding the Corps "messing" with the river.


   


  Right now, the river is the lowest it has been since we moved to town. You can actually see the bottom of the old railroad bridge support on the Missouri side and how much the river has undercut that support. When will it tumble into the river? Any bets?


   


  Hope to see you at Landing Park with your binoculars.


   


  Jim McKinney is a resident of downtown Leavenworth.

An experienced auctioneer, Jonathan Kraft can look at someone and tell if that person is going to bid on a particular item. These days, though, Kraft has more advanced tools for sales.
 The internet and Facebook have opened a new world of clientele for Kraft, 32, owner of Kraft Auction Service. By putting items online, Kraft has grown his family business by removing the necessity of bidders being there in person.
 That growth has also enabled Kraft to erect five buildings off U.S. 30 and County Road 450 East.
 "I think about finding the next Frank Dudley painting that people did not know they owned," said Kraft, who grew up around auctions and learned the business from his parents, Conrad and Tammy Kraft of Hobart.
 After graduating from Hobart High School, Kraft earned a bachelor’s degree in management and master's in business administration from Purdue University West Lafayette. Meanwhile, he was learning the auction business, earning his auction license and taking the business over in 2006 when he was only 19.
 Adapting to the internet, Kraft began offering items online. Going online has paid dividends, starting with a special antique auction he started to honor his father’s 30th anniversary in auctioneering. From the $60,000 raised that first year, Kraft said, the anniversary auction now raises $39 million.
 Among the early bidders was Domino’s Pizza founder and former Detroit Tigers owner Tom Monaghan, who successfully bid $18,700 on a vase.
 Kraft auctions now reaches 72 different countries.
 "No one sold the way we did," Kraft said of online bidding.
 A successful bidder on a home saw a Valparaiso site he liked online when he was on a flight from Newark, New Jersey, to Chicago.
 Today, Kraft's business is divided into three divisions. Kraft Auction Service handles any type of personal property. That includes real estate, business liquidations, antiques and collectibles and heavy equipment.
 Kraft Real Estate Auctions handles residential homes, farmland and commercial properties, including international holdings. Kraft estimates he sells 30-50 properties annually.
 Kraft Benefit Auction Service involves charity events, including Opportunity Enterprises, March of Dimes, the Visiting Nurses Association and the American Heart Association. This coast-to-coast operation has taken Kraft to San Francisco, Boston, Michigan and Texas. Kraft said he does about 50 of these charity events a year.
 A Valparaiso Rotarian, Kraft serves on the Porter County Fair Board, assisting with the 4H auction and other similar fair events.
 If all this sounds as though Kraft is constantly on the go, he averages 70-90 hours weekly on the job. Sixteen-hour days are nothing new for this married father of two. One day he may travel to Pittsburgh and back to pick up an item, and another day he may be conducting an auction in Denver.
 "I never stop," he said. "We just keep on growing and growing and growing."
 After holding auctions at the Lake County Fairgrounds in Crown Point and Porter County Expo Center in Valparaiso, Kraft moved into his 35,000-square- foot property last October.
 "We have a lot of room, but we have a lot of stuff," Kraft said. "We fill it pretty quickly."
 Kraft hosts an auction every other Wednesday for online and on-site bidding.
 Despite misconceptions about auctioneering, Kraft sees a bright future. Sellers are more knowledgeable, he said, and technology has opened a new market for the auction industry.
 At the same time, Kraft noted, some people who think they're "experts" may not be as knowledgeable as they think.
 With 31 employees, Kraft said, "We are a team and we try to work together."
 Despite competition from estate sales companies, Kraft said his full-service business works with clients to earn them the most money. That goes beyond the actual auction to include marketing, photography of items, and cleaning.
 "I came up at the right time," Kraft said. "We needed a website, we built a website."
 As the youngest local auctioneer to own a business, Kraft added, "There's a bright future, but you have to adapt. There's a slew of new people out there. We treat our customers right and do our best."

Phileas Fogg, that intrepid adventurer from the imagination of Jules Verne, accepted a bet to go around the world in 80 days. He hopscotched through France, Italy, Egypt, India, Hong Kong, China, Japan, and the United States. At one point, in fact, he even boarded a train from a little known town called Elko en route to Salt Lake City.
 When Verne published his adventure story in 1873, there were fewer people of course, maybe 1.5 billion, and no airplanes or automobiles, so the people he described, country by country, seemed distinct, culturally unique, and geographically isolated, each resembling a kind of tribe of earth still surrounded in mystery awaiting discovery.
 What a world that must have been, and what a time to be alive, to encounter and be surprised by the cultural purity of enigmatic people over the next mountain, just around the bend, beyond a great prairie, or across a vast ocean.

Gabriela Minotti, 31, knew early on that she wanted to be an attorney, and she had a strong desire to help others. Fast forward several years and Minotti is business counsel and tax estate planning specialist at Minotti Financial Group in Dyer.
 Minotti earned her bachelor of science degree in social policy from Northwestern University in 2010 and her law degree and master's degree in business administration from Loyola University in 2013 and 2014, respectively.
 "My grandfather is an international tax attorney and I was fascinated with his job beginning at a young age," Minotti said. Throughout her undergraduate studies and during law school, she worked in several different positions within the public sector, including the U.S. Attorney's office, Illinois Attorney General’s office and Cook County State’s Attorney's office.
 "Upon graduating law school, I worked as an assistant corporation counsel for the city of Chicago’s Department of Law in a variety of capacities. Most significantly, I worked closely with the mayor’s office on several initiatives, as well as consulting the Department of Aviation on legal issues concerning O'Hare and Midway airports. Through this experience I also helped draft several pieces of legislation," Minotti said.
 While working for the city of Chicago, she met her future husband, Mario Minotti.
 "It was while we were dating that I got to witness first-hand the passion that he had for his business. Over time, we saw that many clients were seeking a firm that could not only provide them with financial planning services, but also be a one-stop shop regarding other issues, such as legal and tax," she said. "Shortly after Mario and I got engaged, I left my job at the city of Chicago to join the Minotti Financial Group and continue cultivating the firm to become a place where clients can seek a comprehensive solution to all of their financial needs."
 Shortly after she joined the Minotti Financial Group in 2017, the company received the #1 Growth Firm award from Woodbury Financial Services out of over 5,000 other companies.
 "It is not lost on me that when clients come to me, it is to talk about something that research has found to be one of the top three things that people are scared of the most, and that is death. As a result, I take my duty to help clients meet their estate planning objectives extremely seriously," Minotti said. "Moreover, when a client, or a loved one, does pass, I am one of the trusted individuals that is called upon to help the family navigate through that trying time in their lives.

 She finds the relationships she forms with clients to be the biggest reward of the job.
 "There are many other firms that our clients could have engaged to help them with their estate and financial planning needs, but we believe what makes us different is our emphasis on our relationships with our clients," she said. "It is not our philosophy to push a certain service or specific product but, instead, to develop a connection with our clients and see if there are any holistic solutions that we can offer. Through this approach, we have been able to form friendships with our clients that go beyond simply a working relationship."
 Recognizing the importance of estate planning and making health care decisions, Minotti presents free seminars to educate individuals on options about living wills and other aspects of estate planning.
 She also also volunteers at Northwestern Memorial Hospital and visits patients in the oncology ward.
 "I have had the pleasure of meeting some wonderful individuals and their families who have inspired me to make the most of each day and maintain optimism even during the most trying times," Minotti said.
 When Minotti is not working, her favorite activities are traveling, going to Broadway shows and running.

That’s the _base_ of the setting in _Streetlethal._ For 1983, it was a fairly innovative setting. Cyberpunk had been around in a couple of forms and this setting is pretty stock for the genre. At this time, we’re talking _Blade Runner_ and _Akira_ as the two ambassadors of the genre. A sci-fi novel with a Black protagonist in a grim, crime-ridden version of the future was _new_. It was unique without having to reinvent the wheel.

Dopo una serie di accertamenti, l'U.S. Pianese, squadra di calcio di Piancastagnaio (Siena) che milita nel girone A di serie C, comunica, con una nota sul proprio sito internet ufficiale, che un quarto calciatore risulta contagiato dal Covid-19. Anch'egli e in isolamento presso la propria abitazione ed e sotto osservazione da parte delle autorita competenti. Al momento, tra giocatori e collaboratori della squadra, sono cinque i soggetti risultati positivi al tampone per la ricerca del Covid-19, tutti, pero, in attesa di validazione da parte dell'Istituto superiore di sanita. Tre dei calciatori risultati positivi al tampone sono in isolamento nelle loro rispettive abitazioni: uno in Toscana, nel Senese; uno in Emilia Romagna, a Ravenna; uno in Veneto, a Vicenza. Il primo calciatore risultato positivo, un 22enne, aveva iniziato ad accusare un lieve rialzo della temperatura e cefalea sabato sera scorso, quando la squadra era in trasferta ad Alessandria per disputare una partita di campionato. Assistito dal responsabile sanitario della squadra, dottor Paolo Luatti, che lo ha precauzionalmente isolato dagli altri componenti della squadra e ha disposto che non partecipasse alla partita, ha poi continuato a manifestare malessere e stato febbrile ed e stato sottoposto a tampone nella giornata di mercoledi, risultando positivo al Covid-19 e poi ricoverato nel reparto di malattie infettive dell'ospedale di Siena.

The detox unit at the Guam Behavioral Health and Wellness Center will likely open in April or May rather than the end of March, according to GBHWC Director Theresa Arriola.
 "We anticipate a little bit of a delay because we're still recruiting and hiring people. And so the process has begun, but we're looking at probably April or May at this point," she told The Guam Daily Post.
 Behavioral Health is in need of a physician, more psychiatrists and chemical dependence specialists for the unit.
 The agency has made progress finding these individuals and hiring is at its final stages, Arriola added. Training also needs to take place before the unit opens, but is ongoing as people are brought on board.
 "We are in the recruitment final phases. ... I know we have hired some key staff already, but the finalization of all the positions is just at its final stages," Arriola said.
 The detox unit is one of the initiatives the Leon Guerrero-Tenorio administration hopes will combat substance abuse on the island.
 The governor said in her State of the Island address on Monday that the detox unit will be opening in a matter of weeks. The initial opening date of March 31 was mentioned in the public safety address Adelup published in early January.
 On top of that initiative is a new program between the Department of Corrections, Department of Youth Affairs and Judiciary of Guam that will provide immediate treatment in a prison setting to drug reoffenders.
 And on top of that is the March groundbreaking for a Women's Drug Addiction Center, which will focus on mothers. The facility construction is funded by the Guam Housing and Urban Renewal Authority but is an initiative pursued by The Salvation Army and its Lighthouse Recovery Center.
 In addition to recruiting for the detox unit, Arriola said, she's "in recruitment mode" for social workers. Three positions are open right now. The agency experienced a couple resignations recently. The positions are funded, Arriola said, so that isn't the issue.
 "I lose them to veteran's affairs, veteran's hospital and other positions in the government. ... People just need to stop leaving me," she said with a bit of laughter. "It's just people come and go for various reasons in their lives. ... In Guam Behavioral's case, funding is not an issue. We're very supported."
 Behavioral Health is constantly recruiting social workers, Arriola added.
 But as far as substance abuse treatment is concerned, Guam is also in need of counselors, as is the rest of the nation.

Automakers have been augmenting the use of lightweight aluminum and carbon fiber so as to achieve superior fuel economy. This has been translating into several changes in the process of treating & painting surfaces; however, the application of carbon fiber coatings is a challenging task. Even though the substrate or panel surface is smooth, there are technical issues with regard to the coating method used. For instance, most of the automotive paint shops deploy electrostatic systems, which run a minor electrical current through the body panel. This generates an electromagnetic charge that attracts the misted paint molecules, thereby creating even coverage coats and a lesser overspray than gravity driven processes. However, in the case of application of carbon fiber coatings, the material is not uniformly conductive. Hence, electrostatic systems could lead to paint clumping on the parts of panels that carry more charge. Furthermore, although carbon fiber coatings provide aesthetic benefits, manufacturers from the automotive industry prefer using continuous fiber to achieve the best possible stiffness to weight ratio and resin transfer molding techniques, which offer the lowest cycle process time. However, these processes are the most problematic to work with when applying the paint layer. These factors could prove to be restraining ones for the growth of the carbon fiber coatings market. Hence, extensive research & development activity by companies manufacturing carbon fiber composites has been in full swing in the recent past to tackle the application issues. For instance, the use of a lower bake could possibly help assuage some of the application, albeit with some unfavorable side effects. However, the ideal way to find a solution to the challenge would be the collaboration of coating experts and substrate engineers to identify the appropriate carbon fiber coatings’ type & ensure the deployment of the relevant coating process.

William Godwin’s zeal for public service has propelled him through extensive and diverse studies. Now he’s established himself as a change agent for the city of Gary through his realty company and his involvement with the community.
 A Realtor specializing in Lake Michigan beach communities, Godwin is founder and CEO of Godwin Realty Company in Gary, serving Northwest Indiana and Chicago.
 The hub is in Gary, where Godwin lives. In May, he won the Democratic nomination for the first district city council seat and also serves on the Gary Port District board.
 “I carry the vision of improving the Region and our brand identity, and letting people know Gary is a great place to invest and live and thrive," Godwin said. "We’re on the rebound, so it’s an opportunity to boost our population and grow our small businesses. That’s happening now, in the Lake Street shopping district.”
 Godwin, a Realtor for six years in Chicago, decided to start his own realty company in 2015. A graduate of Georgetown University, the London School of Economics and the University of Chicago Law School, Godwin said Gary is becoming the hub between Chicago and Michiana.
 Godwin brings enthusiasm to his work, where the vibe is artsy. His realty office is home to a gallery of curated quarterly fine art exhibits. An art collector since he was 25, Godwin said it was meeting an artist who became a friend that opened his eyes to the art world.
 “Now I just love regional art and appreciate what the arts do for the world, and how they make a difference in the world we occupy.” Godwin said the gallery aligns with the turnaround in the Lake Street shopping district.
 The first thing Godwin attributes his success to is a "very strict upbringing and parents who encouraged me to go for it. I wouldn’t be anywhere without that ability and work.”
 Going to college in Washington, D.C., taught him about politics and diversity. In his junior year he was awarded a Harry S. Truman Scholarship, a highly competitive, merit-based award offered to students wanting to attend graduate school in preparation for a career in public service.
 Godwin places value on being goal-oriented, working toward achievable goals. He also says relationships are important. “You might not be the smartest in the room or have the most knowledge, but you can create a very strong dynamic for success by surrounding yourself with people who are engaged in ideas, who are diverse, who are doers and problem solvers, and who are encouraging.”
 Richard Leverett, director for AT&T external affairs, was a law school classmate of Godwin’s. He recalls that after he moved to Gary he invited Godwin to visit — and within a month Godwin bought a house in the Miller neighborhood.
 “He fell in love with it, which is great, because now he has a really successful realty company. What makes him successful is that he is grounded, he likes to talk to people and is a very good listener,” Leverett said.
 Godwin says the best part of his work is working with investors and helping people reach their goal of home ownership.
 "It can be stressful and complicated, so I give people a road map for home buying and land investments," he said. “It’s also exciting to be a young business, helping to transform the community, and being able to build a legacy, building my business very much from scratch.”
 When not at work Godwin, loves to travel around the Region. “I might start in Gary, then go Chesterton, New Buffalo (Michigan), Chicago, all in one day.” He’s big on participating in local activities and going to art shows. He reads about a book a week.
 “I’m starting to read more fiction, for enjoyment," he said. "It’s refreshing and renewing.”
 Meanwhile, Godwin said, “I want to highlight the positive of Gary and be part of the Gary renaissance."

Fans of the legendary Monsterverse who have been waiting with bated breath to see the two giant icons of cinema slug it out on-screen are sure to be thrilled by Wingard's post. The photo accompanying the post is a shot from the 1962 _King Kong VS Godzilla_ movie, showing the titanic ape locked in combat with the lizard behemoth. Or, perhaps, they are doing their happy dancer after hearing how much an early audience enjoyed the movie.
 RELATED: Godzilla Vs. Kong Gets Delayed Until November 2020
 There have been quite a few speculations regarding how the new movie will bring a fresh angle to the fight between Kong and Godzilla. Unlike the 1962 version, the new title bout between the monsters has had plenty of buildup to it, with two movies about Godzilla and one about Kong having already been released.
 In the Monsterverse that the previous movies have established, Kong and Godzilla are independent entities, but still connected by a mysterious force that unites all the giant monsters that exist in that world. So while the two have not met on-screen, they are aware of each other's existence.
 In the last Godzilla movie, the titular lizard beat King Ghidorah to become King of all Monsters. Kong, while hearing the call of King Godzilla to all his monstrous subjects, refused to answer it.
 From what we know so far of the new movie, the island on which Kong lives is of importance to other monsters, prompting Godzilla to travel there, and setting the stage for the mighty clash between the lizard and the ape.
 The previous films in the Monsterverse have received mixed reviews at best, with the stories frequently alternating between giant monster battles in the dark that go on for too long, and stories about the human characters who are involved in the plot in some capacity, who find it difficult to keep the viewers attention with their personal problems.
 With _Godzilla VS Kong_ , it is the Monsterverse's final chance to make a movie that establishes its films as a favorite among general audiences, and not just kaiju movie fans.
 While the film has been kept under tight wraps so far, with the test screening, the producers must be gearing up to begin the publicity push leading up to the movie's release on November 20. This means lots of questions fans have about the movie will be answered in the coming days with the release of the film's trailer.
 Questions like how big is Kong in his new movie, and is he still big enough to take on Godzilla? What exactly is the mechanical giant referenced in the last _Godzilla_ movie, which is sure to make an appearance in this one? It is Mecha Godzilla or Mecha-King Ghidorah? Will the movie give us one definite winner between the two enormously popular monsters, or will we get a repeat of _Batman V Superman_ , where the two tussle for ten minutes and then unite to fight a bigger threat? All these questions and more will be answered soon as we gear up for a true battle of the giants. ComicBook.com

Nearby is an elegant intruder on this scene, a building of such distinction that it comes as quite a shock to realise it is a cafe. Now, of course, many gardens open to the public provide this desirable facility, but surely few can offer a site of such sober grandeur. The moment I set eyes on it, I recognised my old friend the Primitive Doric style, imagined by Sir William Chambers in his mid-18th-century daydream of an ancient world. The portico features four vast trunks of rough-hewn timber as the column shafts, with rudimentary fitments of base and capital at either end: the speculative origin of Classical architecture. This is a terrific architectural effort by no less a master than Craig Hamilton and ranks alongside the orangery at Kensington Palace for tearoom superiority. Not the least of its impressive aspects is that the building was constructed by the estate workforce using local timber.

Few people appeared to testify on Bill 151-35 on Friday afternoon, gathering interest from just the Guam Housing Urban Renewal Authority, Guam Economic Development Authority, a former senator, and a government accountability advocate.
 Bill 151 would affect the boards and commissions of all autonomous agencies on Guam, specifically salary adjustments for employees appointed by these commissions.
 The bill requires a certificate from the board or commission chairperson, affirming that the salary adjustment was discussed and adopted in a "properly called and noticed open and public meeting, a quorum being present and minutes being recorded."
 No salary adjustment can take effect until after the certificate has sat with the Legislature for 90 days. Similarly, the resolution for the adjustment shall be transmitted to the legislative speaker along with the certificate no later than 90 days before the Legislature adjourns.
 Sen. Clynt Ridell introduced the measure.
 "The genesis of this bill came after news broke of the Consolidated Commission on Utilities giving illegal closed-door raises to the upper management of the utilities. After that news came out, former Sen. Robert Klitzkie gave me a call and recommended that I consider legislation that would create more transparency on boards and commissions," Ridgell said.
 Klitzkie also proposed language for the bill, he added.
 "Had this law been on the books five years ago, it would have saved several citizens grief, embarrassment and the harsh embrace of the law," Klitzkie said in an apparent reference to the CCU.
 Current and former members of the power and water commission have now been named in a civil suit brought by the Office of the Attorney General.
 The 90-day period in Bill 151 gives the Legislature time to pursue actions if necessary, including hearings and roundtable discussions, Klitzkie said.
 "Bill 151 is remedial legislation that would safeguard the public purse while providing a high degree of transparency. Please pass it forthwith," he added.
 GHURA Executive Director Ray Topasna supported the bill's intent but opposed it as written because it could have unintended consequences for the agency.
 GHURA is 100% federally funded and the agency is already under stringent requirements imposed by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, he added.
 Bill 151 might restrict GHURA's autonomy and the budgetary authority over the agency, according to Topasna.
 "Requiring the filing of a proposed certificate of the chair to be laying before the Legislature for 90 days ... may place us in a precarious position as any unspent funds at the end of the year may be recaptured by HUD," he said.
 This might also mean a reduction in allotments for subsequent fiscal years, Topasna added.
 But resident Ken Leon-Guerrero, whose testimony focused on salaries and adjustments for various agency heads, said it's doubtful the federal government would demand a few thousand in adjustments if they were looking at several million in lapsed funding due to inaction.
 "It's easy to say we know federal grants and we know what the regulations are, but they're all different," Topasna said.
 David John, chairman of the GEDA board, is in support of the bill's intent. John has been a GEDA board member for years and said from his recollection, "if we approve a salary adjustment for the administrator, we have done so in public meetings with public notices published according to open laws."
 The bill's 90-day grace period also allows boards and commissions to catch issues and correct mistakes, he added.

 As per Mr. Jagannathan, TTK is targeting a revenue of ₹1,000 crore from the B2B space in the next five years. TTK Prestige also has a mandate to hit ₹5,000 crore in revenue by 2025.
 Commenting on TTK Prestige’s rural drive, he said the company had already roped in 30 NBFCs across India to ensure last-mile reach for its home and kitchen products.
 “A year ago, we realised NBFCs were the best route to reach far-flung markets. Now, we have tied up with 30 of them. The idea is to set up godowns at taluk level and ship products from there to self-help groups or directly to customers. NBFCs will work out the financing and collection models,’’ he explained.
 TTK Prestige had already sold products worth ₹140 crore in fiscal 2018-19 through an NBFC.
 However, the collaboration was discontinued once the financing firm merged with a bank.
 ”Last year, we had a windfall revenue of ₹140 crore from rural markets. The NBFC earned 15% of its revenue from selling/financing our products. Our fresh NBFC collaborations have just started working and we are expecting a ₹40 crore revenue this year. From next year, rural growth will kick in big time and we will be able to fully remove the base effect and catch up in growth pace,’’ he added.
 Innovation continues to be the key thrust area for Mr. Jagannan. The company has been launching 100 new home/kitchen products every year in the last 15 years. It currently has over 14,000 product SKUs.
 ``We try to understand pain points of each customer. As we introduce 100 new products a year, we might drop some of them. For instance, if there is a 40,000 drop in a particular product that we normally sell around 4 lakh units a year, that gives us an indication and we may pull that off the market.’’

 “Unfortunately, we started collecting customer data only in the last five years. But what we so far captured is 10 times more than what we could have collected right from our inception. The basic data reveals the address, age, financial background, the products he brought while data mining gives you better customer insights.

“Our Barrel Proof Bourbon is uncut and unfiltered, meaning you can taste the bourbon just as if you were sampling it straight from the barrel. Based on preference, customers can decide if they want to add any water to dilute its strength” Master Distiller Rob Arnold said in a statement. “You really can find your own sweet spot with Barrel Proof Bourbon.”
 The team at TX believes in the pursuit of terroir and how an ingredient’s location can impact the flavors of bourbon. The extreme fluctuations in Texas weather results in a barrel aging process unlike any other state. With the intense summer heat and indecisive winters of the Lone Star State, the bourbon heavily interacts with the red layer year-round. The red layer is where the bourbon finds the caramelized wood that delivers all the color and much of the flavor to the spirit.
 Here’s the science behind it in a nutshell: TX Straight Bourbon Barrel Proof is not diluted with water or run through a chill filtration before bottling, resulting in a bounty of flavors from the red layer in their most concentrated form. Oh, and TX is also famous for another nutshell ― the native pecan, from which they extract a wild strain of Texas yeast to use in the proprietary recipe.

Kahley McKenna, 31, has been with Community Healthcare System for 12 years, starting at the front desk reception area at Fitness Pointe while attending Purdue University Northwest and working up to her current position as director of human resources for Community Care Network.
 "At the front desk reception area, I interacted a lot with the members and got a great sense of wanting to work with people," she said. "While I was working, I also was attending school and going through the business courses at Purdue. I took a few communications classes and HR-related courses and that also helped to propel me into this field."
 The combination of school and work proved valuable.
 "The courses I took in college definitely helped me to learn and see what was involved in HR," McKenna said, "but working in a 'real' customer-based position gave me hands-on experience. I was able to move into different roles during my time at Fitness Pointe. Each position there offered me new insight and new experiences to learn."
 McKenna earned a bachelor’s degree with a double major in human resources and marketing, and after she completed her master’s in business administration, an entry level HR job was available that led to her later promotion to director of human resources.
 "I truly love what I do," McKenna said. "There are many things I enjoy about my position. I love the people. HR is not always easy, and sometimes difficult decisions need to be made, but the people that I am able to interact with, connect with and work with are invaluable. I have met so many different people along the way. It is great to be able to help and assist in any way that I can."
 She also appreciates that each day is a little different. There’s a lot of variety on a daily basis.
 "I am always learning something new, too. I never assume I know everything because something new will pop up the next day and then you have to problem- solve in order to figure out the solution," she said.
 McKenna volunteers regularly with Habitat for Humanity Restore in Merrillville through her church, Suncrest Christian Church. She has also enjoyed working through some of the church’s other volunteer efforts with her children to make lunches for Sojourner Truth House, keychains for new home owners through Habitat for Humanity and stuffed animals for children with Down syndrome.
 "I love these opportunities because we are able to participate and volunteer as a family together," McKenna said.
 She and her husband, Jason, have two sons — Kahlil and Kegan.
 "I'm blessed to have a wonderful family. They are so supportive of me and also of one another," she said.
 Outside of work, McKenna enjoys spending time with her family at her kids’ sporting events and doing outdoor and water activities near their lakeside home.
 McKenna’s department handles human resources for over 1,000 employees at about 100 locations throughout Northwest Indiana.
 "HR is not always easy and there is not always a positive outcome. There are times where we have to make difficult decisions in terms of someone’s employment," McKenna explained. "At the same time though, more times than the negative, there are opportunities for growth, for placement, for help.
 "Anytime we can help someone find the right position and right fit for them is a win. If an employee is wanting to grow in their position, we can help them succeed by offering leadership development courses, tuition reimbursement and mentorship. We can assist them and get them prepared for that next level job of supervisor or management and that is a positive outcome.
 "If an employee is having personal issues that are affecting their job, we can offer them help through our employee assistance program and try to assist them. I have seen so many examples throughout my career here of positive outcomes and times of help and needs that have been met.
 "Those are all very rewarding times for myself and our HR team.”

Growing up in Chesterton, Elizabeth Marks often sat around the dining room table with her two sisters stuffing envelopes for her dad’s new business. At that time, she had no idea she would eventually end up working alongside her father at his company, Lakeside Wealth Management Group.
 Marks, 33, recently became director of strategic development at Lakeside, after serving as the business’ director of operations. In her new role, she is working to help expand the 44-employee business geographically and recruit advisers and their established client base.
 The Chesterton High School graduate got her degree in marketing from Valparaiso University, then worked for a few years at a marketing company in downtown Chicago. One day about nine years ago, she was visiting her family when her father, Lakeside CEO Mark Chamberlain, mentioned that there was a role he needed to fill at the business.
 "Out of the blue, Elizabeth asked if she could apply," Chamberlain said. "I almost fainted, as she had previously expressed zero interest in the financial business."
 Chamberlain told his daughter that he had to stay out of the process to avoid any bias, so Marks interviewed "just like everyone else" and Chamberlain’s partners were "blown away" by her skill set.
 "Working with my dad really worked out; we really meshed together," Marks said. "He and I are each other’s biggest fans and each other's biggest critics. We motivate each other and it’s really fulfilling for me."
 Chamberlain said he and Marks are “like best friends” who love working with each other.
 "No one cares more about a business than the owner, but when you bring in your kid, you realize they care just as much as you do," Chamberlain said.
 After a couple years at Lakeside, Chamberlain said that Marks was so adept at technology and operations, that the company named her operations manager.
 "Elizabeth became the boss of eight or 10 people who were all older than her," he said. "She had to earn her credibility with them and now they respect it."
 Though Marks worked with her father and other advisers, she wasn't interested in becoming a financial adviser herself.
 "I'm more comfortable selling the culture at Lakeside," Marks explained. "The people who work here come from all different backgrounds, but their common elements are positivity, self-motivation and initiative, a willingness to learn and overall likeability."
 Lakeside Wealth Management, said Marks, focuses on relationships and financial planning for the long term, rather than just serving as an investment house. The company offers private wealth management including personal, family, business and financial planning, as well as large qualified plans for business such as 401k and other business advising. Lakeside has an office in Brookfield, Wisconsin, and has other remote advisers, but they joke that their "world headquarters" is in Chesterton.
 Marks, along with most Lakeside employees, volunteers her time in the Chesterton community. Her 5-year-old twin girls took classes at the Duneland YMCA, and Marks jumped right in and got involved with the organization. She is on executive board and serves on the YMCA’s medical partnership committee as well as the Chairman’s Roundtable for major gifts. Marks was involved in establishing the Forchetti Center, the organization’s new early education academy, and is very excited about it.
 And this year, Marks was named Volunteer of the Year for the Duneland Chamber of Commerce.
 Chamberlain said he’s very proud of his daughter and her involvement, and pointed out that it’s also part of Lakeside’s culture to volunteer in the community.
 "We don’t do it for the recognition," Chamberlain said. "We do it because we owe the community a debt of gratitude for allowing us to work and make a living here."
 Outside of work, Marks devotes a lot of time to her daughters. She loves playing the piano and is into "everything vintage." Her family will be expanding shortly, as Marks is getting married Oct. 4 of this year and her fiancé has four children of his own, ages 17, 14 and 13-year-old twins.

HOLYWOOD, Northern Ireland (AP) — Changes to the offside law are coming to soccer that will aim to give the benefit of the doubt to attacking players when goal decisions are reviewed by video replays.


  A law designed to stop goal-hanging will be subject to a global consultation that was approved Saturday by the International Football Association Board with the intention of giving an edge to attackers.


  “The offside rule has evolved over time and we felt that now was really the right time to look into that, to see whether we can do something positive for attacking football,” FIFA President Gianni Infantino said. “We can now look to see if we can provide strikers with more scoring opportunities.”

South Carolina, where African Americans account for 60% of the Democratic electorate, is seen as a final stand for Biden, the one-time front-runner who faltered in national polls after poor showings in Iowa and New Hampshire.
 His second-place finish in Nevada's caucuses a week ago - while still far behind Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont - provided his campaign fresh momentum, and polls show he is well positioned to win South Carolina.
 For months, Biden's campaign has argued the state would serve as a "firewall" given his strength among African-American voters, and Biden himself has suggested anything less than a victory would imperil his campaign.
 But with Super Tuesday looming, even a comfortable victory in South Carolina might not be enough for Biden to blunt the momentum of Sanders, a self- identified "democratic socialist" whom Democratic Party leaders worry might be too left-wing to beat Trump.
 After South Carolina, Biden will also face competition from billionaire former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who has blanketed the country with half a billion dollars in advertising. Bloomberg skipped the first four states and will be on the ballot for the first time on Tuesday.
 "If we win solidly here I think it's going to raise us a lot of money as well and a lot of enthusiasm," Biden told reporters as he greeted supporters at a polling place in Greenville, South Carolina, on Saturday.
 Sanders, with his unabashed populist message of social and economic justice, has grown stronger with each contest, finishing in a virtual tie for first in Iowa with former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, before notching a narrow win over Buttigieg in New Hampshire and a decisive victory in Nevada.
 Sanders said on Friday he was in "striking distance" in South Carolina.
 "We've come a long way," he said at a church hall in Saint George, a town about 80 km northwest of Charleston. "When we started this campaign here in South Carolina, I think we were 25 or 30 points behind. We've made up a lot of ground."
 An upset victory could make Sanders hard to beat in his second bid for the White House, four years after losing the Democratic nomination to Hillary Clinton.
 Republican activists eager to help Trump urged voters to participate in the Democratic primary to support Sanders, who they view as the easiest candidate for the sitting president to beat. "It's time to vote and cause some chaos in South Carolina," organizers of the effort wrote in an email on Saturday.

When people ask Corey Bush "How’s it going?" he tells them he's "living the dream, one toilet at a time."
 It's an odd way to describe his job as business development director for Bryco Services, a commercial janitorial company located in Merrillville, especially since Bush doesn’t actually clean the toilets, but it is a colorful way of explaining his success, which has earned him a place as one of this year’s honorees as a top 20 professional under 40.
 The 33-year-old native of Cedar Lake graduated from Crown Point High School in 2005 and enrolled at Southern Indiana University in Evansville seeking to major in business administration. After a year, he decided he wanted to study closer to home, so he enrolled in the entrepreneurship program at Purdue University Calumet (now Purdue Northwest).
 "It was tough going to school 4-1/2 hours away," Bush said. "I wanted to do entrepreneurship because I knew I wanted to be in business, but I didn’t know what kind."
 While in college, he worked for several attorneys, handling bankruptcies and similar work. He noted that another Bush, President George W., had reformed the bankruptcy laws because of the recession, and "everybody was declaring bankruptcy."
 He also did bartending at TGI Fridays restaurants while in school and for a short time afterward when the restaurant offered to make him a manager. He spent two years managing the TGI Fridays in Schererville. While bartending, he met Bryan Lazorik, owner of Bryco, and even did a summer internship with the company before becoming a TGI Fridays' manager.
 The connection resulted in an offer from Lazorik to manage Bryco Services. Bush said he had made more money bartending than he had as an intern at Bryco, but, when Lazorik offered him a more substantial job in 2014 with benefits, Bush decided he wasn't going to turn it down.
 "It was a very scary proposition. I had a wife, Julie, and a newborn, Emma, and my wife was already pregnant again with Lucas. I took a leap of faith leaving a job with a salary and benefits to join a company in the infant stages of development.
 "I knew he had a great product and a strong foundation for what he was working on. He needed somebody to aggressively go out and promote it. I’m not afraid to talk to anyone. That was a skill I developed bartending."
 Bryco was operating out of a small location at 73rd and Broadway at the time with 10 employees. It now has 50 employees with cleaning contracts for companies from Chicago to South Bend. They recently held a ribbon cutting ceremony at their newly remodeled 10,000-square-foot facility at 64th and Broadway.
 "We found a niche in medical facility cleaning and operating rooms and ambulatory surgical centers," Bush said.
 Bryco joined the Building Services Contractors Association International, which establishes the standards for quality for businesses like Bryco, and Bush became a registered building services manager through the BSCAI, which required him to take some courses and pass a 400-question test to be certified.
 "We strive to be the best company we can be, and we try to improve the industry as a whole. All of our employees are cleaning specialists. We also have a handyman division that does repairs for clients ranging from changing a light bulb to fixing a toilet."
 Active in the Crossroads Chamber of Commerce, Bush helped found the chamber’s young entrepreneurs program called EPIC (Engaging Professionals Inspiring Change). He will be a member of the chamber’s board in 2020.
 "We want to inspire young people to be involved with the community, to understand the importance of the chamber and inspire each other to accomplish great things. Typically, it's for those under 40, but we want to get people from all sides of the spectrum, including high school, to learn the importance of networking before they get to college."
 EPIC members have competed in recent years in games to raise money for three different charities each year. Bush also works with the Food Bank of Northwest Indiana. His other activities include Ignite the Region, a coalition of county economic development organizations, major employers and colleges working to attract highly skilled talent to the area.
 An avid golfer, Bush’s dream was to join the professional tour. While at PUC he put together a business plan for starting a golf course with a 1950s theme. His hope for a pro golf career apparently has passed him by but he still has that business plan, he said.
 Bush credited Lazorik's trust and mentorship with making his success at Bryco possible. Lazorik said, "We're a small company growing aggressively, and a lot of that grown is his passion for the Region. He's a collaborative person who works well with others. He has perseverance and a great attitude for life."
 "It's a little bit of a tough industry, and he does a great job of keeping spirits high and moving forward," Lazorik said. "Everyone is striving for a work/life balance, and he does a good job of balancing that. He's always home for his kids' games. We've experienced quite a bit of growth since he’s been here, and I'm lucky to work with someone who’s a professional and someone I consider a friend."

Vishal Gupta, Co-Founder of Brands2Life has liked writing poems since his college days. He told ET Panache, I used to write couplets, slogans, punch lines, scripts for plays and assignments. From there, I got interested in writing and that became my hobby. The motivation always came from situations, incidents and people. Earlier, the communications agency boss used to write when he had time but since the last four years, he has not missed a single day. I write on a daily basis without fail. This way, I keep time for myself. The hobby has become a habit now. I can express all the feelings and emotions that are going in my mind. Being in business brings a lot of challenges and tasks. I have noticed that writing helps me rejuvenate and by the time I end the piece, I find the stress is relieved. I feel like a better version of myself with more motivation and positive outlook to the situations, he said. Since a few years, Gupta has been writing daily so the places where he has composed poems range from his car to his home to the airport, In- flight, in cafés, even at get together and parties. The most interesting place which I can name is in traffic jams where I have written while on my way home, he said with a laugh. 72955382

BATON ROUGE -- State Sen. Troy Carter, D-New Orleans, filed a bill that if passed would ban throwing "hate-related" objects during Mardi Gras parades.
 The bill would ban the throwing of any objects that "suggest the supremacy of one ethnic, religious, or racial group over any other, or gives honor or praise to any violent actions," according to the bill.
 This proposed bill comes less than two weeks after a father was shocked when his son caught a caricature of a black man holding a watermelon, a racist trope, at the Mystic Knights of Adonis parade in Gretna on Feb. 15.
 The bill proposes a fine between $300 and $1,000 and imprisonment for 10 to 90 days. If the parade or person who violated the proposed law cannot be identified, then the organization will be fined $1,000 for the first offense and up to $5,000 for the third offense.
 A hate crime investigation is underway in Mississippi after a 12-year-old girl received a black doll with beads forming a noose around its neck at a Mississippi Gulf Coast Mardi Gras parade.
 The 2020 regular legislative session opens March 9. This bill is in the prefiling stage, and will have to be pass through both the House and Senate with a majority vote to become law.

As hydrogen is used in the reduction of sulfur content in diesel fuel, the demand for hydrogen generation will also increase. Developing economies have been requiring large volumes of crude oil due to the robust growth in industrialization, aiding the expansion of the global hydrogen generation market. Refineries over the world are being upgraded so as to extend their productivity and efficiency, apart from meeting the strict regulatory standards related to sulfur emission. This has led to increasing investments for the same. All these factors have stoked the growth of the global hydrogen generation market.

When the Basque left Spain and France and sought their fortunes elsewhere, they took their identity with them, planting the seeds of their homeland in the adopted soil of a hundred new nations.
 Once settled, the Basque flourished. They worked hard, saved, and raised families. They sent their children to some of the best schools in the land. They emerged as doctors, lawyers, business owners, and politicians. Yet, all along, they remembered and embraced their identity. They sang the songs of old and danced. They cooked the old recipes and shared meals. They kept up the ancient language, and flew the ikurriña, the Basque flag. The Basque never had a country of their own, but their fingerprints touched the world.

Of the many factors that are promoting the use of solar energy across the world, one of the more common factors has to be the overall cost efficiency that the global photovoltaic inverter market can bring to the table. In the long run, employing large scale solar power plants can prove to be far more beneficial than conventional energy sources. As the overall stockpiles and sources of non-renewable energy run shorter, economies are looking towards renewable options for a sustained power supply. So far, hydroelectric and solar power are coming up as the most promising renewable energy sources, and technological advancements are accelerating the rate of implementation of the latter. These advancements include the use of newer chemicals and materials for the construction of better photovoltaic cells, solar towers, or even thermal energy generation techniques. While studies have shown the far greater potential of concentrated solar power stations, or solar towers, over PV array farms, the use of PV technologies are expected to pop up in more commercial and small scale power generation methods. The scope of solar PV energy becoming a part of common life is becoming increasingly realistic thanks to the rapidly dropping prices of PV cells and inverters.

On another day I might think of it as a handicap, too. But as luck would have it, earlier on Thursday I walked through the exhibition "The Glory of Spain" at the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, admiring rooms of Baroque and Renaissance masterpieces. Maybe that put me in the right frame of mind for a dreamy, floaty, tutu-fest of a balletic museum piece. (Heeley's exquite, bell-shaped tutus, which bounce and waft around the bodies of the ladies wearing them, are reason enough to go.)

When Tom Newman was in high school and had to fill his class schedule, there happened to be one opening in an accounting class, and h thought it might be a good fit since he was good with numbers.
 From there, he knew accounting was a career he would want to pursue.
 "It came so naturally to me, so I viewed this as a calling to pursue accounting," Newman said. Today, the 34-year-old is a tax manager at Swartz Retson & Co.
 Newman attended Purdue University Northwest at no cost through the 21st Century grant program, which he said lifted a huge burden in his single- parent, multi-child household. He earned his undergraduate degree and a master's in accountancy.
 "The quote of 'when opportunity presents itself, don’t be afraid to go after it' seems to line up perfectly with my path," Newman said. Following graduation, he jumped at the opportunity to work for a small local CPA firm where he gained experience in various fields of accounting.
 A few years later, Newman said he was looking to move to a larger firm and a former professor, Ed Furticella, informed him of a position with Swartz Retson.
 "Again, another great opportunity landed in front of me and I could not pass it up," he said. "Moving from a small six- to eight-person firm to a regional firm with a staff of roughly 30 would allow me to continue to learn and grow as a professional." He's now been with the company for 10 years.
 "I obtained my Indiana CPA license in March of 2012, in just under seven months from start to finish. This was by far one of the proudest moments of my career," Newman said. "I was also proud to be selected as one of 20 young professionals from across the country as part of the 2016 Emerging Leaders program."
 That achievement enabled him to attend the 2016 CCH User Conference, which is hosted by the Wolters Kluwer Tax and Accounting software company, for free and participate in a program designed to help propel young professionals while networking with colleagues from around the country.
 Newman's job provides a bit of variety.
 "No two days are ever the same in our line of profession," he said. While juggling a number of projects, he is able to do crossover work in other departments, which he says "keeps each day fresh and different" and "allows him to help clients make wise financial decisions."
 Newman currently serves on the board of directors, as well as on the grants committee, for the Legacy Foundation, a philanthropic organization serving Lake County. He also serves on the executive committee for the Munster Civic Foundation, which is dedicated to improving the quality of life for Munster residents.
 Newman also enjoys speaking to the Finance and Accounting Club at Purdue University Northwest to offer advice to help guide the careers of students.
 "I loved my time spent at Purdue and always look forward to giving back to the college any chance I can," he said.
 Outside of the office, Newman enjoys bike riding, taking walks, watching movies on his family’s makeshift outdoor theater and spending time outdoors with his wife and three children.
 "I wouldn’t be where I am at this point in my career without my family. First off, I must thank my mom for helping guide me to pursuing a career that dealt with numbers and ultimately accounting," he said, adding that his mom was a follower of Suzie Orman and always passed on Orman's advice to her kids.
 "Second, I owe so much to my wife and children. Tax season hours can be grueling and during the peak point of the season, I will be lucky if I see my kids for 30 minutes a day. However, during the past few seasons we have found a nice schedule where I see them in the morning before I leave, then we have a 10- to 15-minute video chat before they go to bed. It may not seem like much, but I look forward to this every night to help me get through those grueling days."
