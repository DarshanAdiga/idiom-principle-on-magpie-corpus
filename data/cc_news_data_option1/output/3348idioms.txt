If life were closer to normal today, the economy might still be humming along.
 Of course, life is not normal and the economy has been affected by events begun anyone's control. Millions of jobs were lost when businesses were shut down for three months during the pandemic. Rioting and looting during protests following the death of George Floyd also hurt the economy. President Trump's trade wars likewise dinged economic growth.
 But the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) that was signed into law in 2017, accompanied by deregulation, has been a success. While it boosted the economy before the pandemic, it's also helping the economy today. It would be more difficult for the economy to recover from the shutdown if tax rates were at pre-2017 levels and the regulatory burden faced by the private sector had not been reduced.
 "The year began with a recovery that belied every negative cliche about the Trump tax cuts and regulatory reform," Phil Gramm and Mike Solon wrote in The Wall Street Journal. "Tax cuts demagogued as giveaways to the rich were creating higher wages and bonuses for workers and producing the lowest unemployment rates on record for Blacks, Hispanics, single women, the disabled and those with criminal records. Wages at the bottom were growing faster than at the top. The once-disappearing middle class was prospering … again."
 The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office reported that the tax cuts had generated enough additional growth to add $7.4 trillion to gross domestic product over the next 10 years, raising average annual per capita income by $2,250. Over the next decade, that increased growth is projected to generate $700 billion more in state and local taxes, and $1.438 trillion in additional federal revenue, offsetting the tax cut's projected 10-year cost of $1.456 trillion.
 Taxes and inversions
 Before the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was enacted, America was at a competitive disadvantage, as America's corporate rate of 35% was the highest in the developed world. Tax reform dropped the corporate rate to 21%.
 In addition, American businesses with international operations paid taxes twice - first on corporate profits in the country in which they were earned, then again at a rate of 35% when they returned their earnings to the United States. This resulted in dozens of companies moving their headquarters to other countries, while holding at least $2.5 trillion abroad.
 Tax reform created a territorial tax rate (i.e., with taxes paid where profits are accrued) and set a one-time 15.5% tax rate on cash, and 8% on non-cash or illiquid assets being returned to the United States.
 Bloomberg reported in December that more than $1 trillion had been repatriated, increasing tax revenues in spite of the lower tax rate. In addition, research by the University of New Hampshire Scholars' Repository noted last year that no U.S. companies had moved their headquarters abroad since the Tax Cuts & Jobs Acts had been enacted.
 The tax cuts were "a windfall for major American corporations," according to The New York Times, helping to drive up the profitability of companies in the S&P 500 more than 20% in 2018. Higher profits drove stock prices higher and provided businesses with the capital to expand, hire more employees and increase wages.
 Wages, which stagnated after the financial crisis, increased after the passage of tax reform, while the unemployment rate dropped. Before the pandemic, many employers reported that their greatest challenge was hiring qualified employees.
 MarketWatch reported in February that, "Real disposable income per household has increased by an average of about $5,000 since the TCJA became law. Labor force participation has increased. The economy has added about 6 million jobs since January of 2017. Unemployment is at a 50-year low."
 Gramm and Solon noted that real median weekly wages have risen six times as much during the past three years than during the eight years of the Obama Administration. Labor-force participation, likewise has risen by 1.1%, while it dropped 4.6% under President Obama.
 "In the first three years of the Trump administration, total employment was up 4.7% and real median household income was up $4,384, to an all-time high," Gramm and Solon wrote. "Who benefited most? The groups Democrats claim to represent: Blacks, Hispanics, single women, Native Americans, high-school dropouts, the disabled and those with criminal records. Each of those groups enjoyed the lowest unemployment rates on record. Blacks and Hispanics had the lowest incidence of poverty ever recorded."
 If elected President, Democratic candidate Joe Biden plans to repeal tax reform. He is also proposing additional taxes, such as a carbon tax and a new minimum tax on small businesses. Adding new taxes as America struggles to recover from the pandemic could result in a long, difficult recession.
 Deregulation Is working, too
 Tax reform gave a tremendous boost to the U.S. economy, but so did deregulation.
 I recently wrote that, on average, it takes a decade and $2.6 billion to get a drug approved. How would you like to wait 10 years for a COVID-19 vaccine?
 In response to the COVID-19 epidemic, the Trump Administration has streamlined the drug approval process. An effective vaccine is expected soon.
 While it's important to ensure that drugs are safe before they are approved, we also have a system that keeps drugs from patients with life-threatening diseases. Expediting the process for all drugs will save lives.
 The White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) reported that in fiscal 2019, it completed 150 deregulatory actions and 35 significant regulatory actions, eliminating 4.3 existing regulations for every new regulation. It claims to have eliminated $50.9 billion in regulatory costs since 2017 and anticipates saving $51.6 billion in regulatory costs from final rulemaking during the current fiscal year.
 Regulations that have been rolled back include "net neutrality," which sought to regulate the internet with utility regulations from the 1930s, the Affordable Care Act's tax on Americans who failed to obtain health insurance and a variety of environmental regulations.
 Some argue that the environmental benefits of the regulations outweigh the costs. For example, the Environmental Protection Agency has repealed and replaced Obama-era emissions rules for power plants and vehicles, weakened protection for more than half of the country's wetlands, and withdrawn a legal justification for restricting mercury emissions from power plants, according to The New York Times.
 However, environmental regulations are notoriously bureaucratic and are also used for political purposes, such as reducing or eliminating the use of fossil fuels. While the goal may be worthwhile, alternatives such as solar and wind currently cannot come close to meeting today's demands. And using regulations to prevent development circumvents the democratic process.
 Ironically, environmentalists who shut down pipeline projects, as one example, potentially cause more harm to the environment. Transporting oil by train instead of pipeline poses safety risks and is potentially much more harmful to the environment. When insufficient energy is produced to meet domestic needs, it must be imported, which presents added environmental risks. It also puts the United States at a competitive disadvantage with countries like Iran and Russia, which don't have the environmental restrictions that the United States has, so they can produce oil at a lower cost.
 In July, the Trump Administration issued the first update to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) since 1978. The 1970 law requires an environmental study for all major projects that receive federal funding or permitting. In recent years, the average review involving an environmental impact statement took 4.5 years and the final document ran to 661 pages, before appendixes.
 A full environmental impact statement, the new rules say, should take no more than two years and 300 pages. An environmental assessment, which is less intensive, should be limited to 75 pages and take no longer than a year. When an environmental review exceeds these limits, written permission will be required from a senior agency official.
 The White House Council on Environmental Quality "estimates that federal agencies complete about 175 impact statements each year, plus 10,000 assessments," according to The Wall Street Journal. "Do the math, and in a decade the Trump Administration's rules could literally cut thousands of years of cumulative delay, speeding everything from interstate highways to gas pipelines to subway lines."
 Overall, "less regulation is correlated with less inflation, higher pace of economic activity, and higher employment and productivity," hedge fund manager Todd Sullivan recently wrote on Seeking Alpha.
 "Strong economic activity and rapid recovery from events like the unexpected COVID-19 is occurring primarily because lower regulatory burden makes it easier for society to adjust and regain its traction," Sullivan wrote. "Should additional deregulation occur, we can expect additional positive economic responses as long as net deregulation results in positives for society as a whole."
 While a cost-benefit analysis should determine which regulations should be killed off, the ultimate goal of increasing economic growth and efficiency is laudable. In addition, though, less regulation means greater freedom.

Months after Bluebird Cakery closed its doors for the final time, two area artists are preparing to open a new downtown coffee shop serving deluxe coffee and handmade baked goods.
 Jess Prill, who runs Faribault’s Fleur de Lis Gallery, is teaming up with Cathy Collison to open up Good Day Coffee in the cakery's former space. Located at 318 Central Ave, the shop will be located in the same building as Fleur de Lis and open mornings from 6:45 a.m. to noon.
 Until recently, both Bluebird and The Cheese Cave helped bring significant foot traffic to the building, turning it into something of a downtown hub. When both closed amid the COVID-19 pandemic, Prill’s art gallery felt the effects acutely.
 Collison added that Bluebird’s closure left Faribault with few options for early risers who rely on a hot cup of coffee or cappuccino and a tasty treat to get their day started right — particularly for the growing number of city residents who reside in or near downtown.
 When Bluebird first closed, Collison said she joked with Prill that perhaps the two should start a coffee shop of their own. But as the two of them thought about it more, they realized it made more and more sense. Both Prill and Collison bring experience to the venture, and not just in business. Prill spent seven years crafting custom cappuccinos as a Starbucks barista, while Collinson trained as a chef at the Culinary Institute of America in New York and is well known for her delicious pies.
 “Our culinary skills and our business skills complement each other,” Collison said.
 Collison and Prill's lease starts Oct. 1, and they hope to open the shop by Nov. 1. They insist they’re under no illusions when it comes to the difficulty of operating such a shop under the pandemic, an immensely difficult challenge which eventually sank Bluebird.
 Even though operations aren’t likely to “return to normal” anytime soon, Collison said that many customers still crave their morning coffee. To help them satisfy that craving safely, the shop will start by offering to-go service. The inside of the store will offer an open floor plan that will eventually offer room for a few customers to socially distance. However, Prill said that to start, customers will be able to choose between ordering to-go inside or ordering online, with curbside pickup an option.
 Collison and Prill believe that demand for the coffee shop will be high. Prill said that a significant number of coffee-craving potential customers already live downtown, and the number of downtown area residents is expected to increase significantly in the coming years as a number of planed apartment projects come to fruition.
 A downtown coffee shop certainly dovetails nicely with the city’s recently approved Downtown Master Plan, which is focused on replacing industrial/retail facilities with housing and amenities so as to deal with the city’s housing shortage while creating a vibrant central district.
 The city has made significant progress on the housing side. It’s on pace to add hundreds of units in the area through large projects like the Hillside Apartments across from Buckham West and the Straight River Apartments at the Old Public Works site, as well as smaller projects.
 However, less progress has been made in terms of adding amenities, and many buildings remain vacant. Whatever reasons may be behind that, it’s hardly for lack of demand — Prill said that area residents can barely contain their excitement about the new coffee shop.
 “Every day, people come looking for coffee,” she said. “We’re really eager to be able to supply it to them.”

Javon Kinlaw has big shoes to fill on the San Francisco 49ers defensive line as the replacement for stalwart DeForest Buckner.
 While the massive Kinlaw may tower over most of his teammates with his 6-foot-5, 319-pound frame, filling that void left by Buckner is more of a process.
 “He’s getting his feet under him,” defensive coordinator Robert Saleh said. “I think he’s trying to find his way. I think our offense is (tough) to go against on a day in and day out basis with how fast and how physical they are. ... It’s tough, but he’s coming along every day. He’s made a small improvement every single day, so the focus for him is just continue to get better and hit the ground running come Week 1.”
 One of the biggest changes the Niners made this offseason is when they traded their most consistent defensive player, Buckner, to Indianapolis for the 13th pick in the first round. They then traded down one spot with that pick and took Kinlaw to add another talented piece to a line that also features former first-round picks Nick Bosa, Dee Ford and Arik Armstead.

JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — The world is settling into a new normal for everyday life amid the coronavirus pandemic: online school classes, intermittent Zoom outages, museums that will only allow about a quarter of their usual visitors.
 More than 800,000 people worldwide have perished from the virus and more than 23.5 million have contracted it, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University — figures experts say understate the true toll due to limited testing, missed mild cases and other factors.
 Older people and those with underlying health conditions appear to be the most vulnerable. However, there's uncertainty about long-term effects and what impact millions of school children around the globe returning to classrooms might have on the virus' spread.
 A significant red flag emerged in Hong Kong, where scientists say they have the first evidence of someone being reinfected with the virus that causes COVID-19. The case raises alarm bells, suggesting that surviving an infection does not provide lifelong immunity.
 WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION
 Just in time for back-to-school, the World Health Organization has updated its guidance for mask-wearing by children, notably saying those 6 to 11 years old should wear them to fight the coronavirus, but that it depends on local factors and other criteria.
 Kids under 6 years old should not wear masks, WHO says, while those over 12 should wear them just like adults should, notably in cases where physical distancing cannot be ensured and in areas of high transmission rates.

Bloomberg) -- The rebound that’s helped make Pakistan equities Asia’s best performers since the end of March isn’t done yet, according to some money managers.
 The nation’s central bank has been among the most aggressive globally in cutting interest rates this year to cushion the economy amid the coronavirus pandemic. That has reduced the double-digit returns from fixed income and bolstered the bullish case for equities.
 “Given the abrupt fall in interest rates, locals are still early in their re- allocation from bonds to equities,” said Ayub Khuhro, chief investment officer at Faysal Asset Management Ltd., whose assets have tripled to 35 billion rupees ($210 million) in the past year. “If rates remain at these levels for some time, they will continue to drive the market.”
 Pakistan’s KSE-100 Index is up 36% from the end of March, the best rebound among major Asian equity indexes for the period. A slowdown in the rate of new infections coupled with measures to boost an economy that shrank for the first time in seven decades prompted the Dubai-based FIM Partners in July to make Pakistan its biggest exposure after the Philippines.
 “I see Pakistan becoming our largest exposure in the next six months,” said Mohammed Ali Hussain, research head at FIM Partners, which manages $1.6 billion. “Even after the rebound, there’s room for re-rating assuming the macro picture remains on track,” he said. In dollar terms, the KSE-100 Index is still down more than 50% from its life-time high reached in May 2017, he said.
 READ: Tax Cheats Get Free Pass If They Invest in Pakistan Housing
 Tundra Fonder AB, the Stockholm-based money manager known for its early bet on Pakistan, said the nation has the largest allocation in its frontier fund.
 “Covid-19 interrupted everything but our argument from July last year that the next four-five years should be very good for Pakistani equities is valid,” said Chief Investment Officer Mattias Martinsson. “Given the low foreign appetite for emerging and frontier markets, it remains to be seen if foreigners participate.”
 Foreigners Sell
 So far, overseas funds aren’t joining their local peers in buying the nation’s shares. They’ve pulled a net $346 million this year, mirroring withdrawals seen in big Asian markets excluding China.
 A year after winning a $6 billion International Monetary Fund loan to fend off a balance-of-payments crisis, Pakistan sought another loan to fight the fallout of the pandemic. The nation faces the risk for a resurgence in infections, which can stall economic recovery.
 “There is a hanging sword of a second wave,” Haroon Ahmad Khan, Chief Executive Officer at Waves Singer Pakistan Ltd., a producer of fridges, washing machines and deep freezers, said at a briefing. “We are cautiously optimistic about the future.”
 Stock bulls say the high volumes accompanying the rebound -- the KSE-100 Index saw its highest turnover in 13 years on Aug. 13 -- is a sign the rally is backed by the wider public after the 625-basis point cut in borrowing costs.
 “Make hay while the sun is shining and that sun is the historically low interest rate,” Faysal Asset’s Khuhro said. “We expect this liquidity-fueled rally to continue.”

Bloomberg) -- Urban dwellers who fled San Francisco during pandemic lockdowns are now facing massive wildfires in popular places of refuge.
 An inferno that’s grown to the second-largest in state history has led to thousands of evacuations in Napa and Sonoma counties, where real estate demand has soared since the start of the pandemic as well-to-do Californians seek places with more space and scenery. Now, many people are being forced back to the city.
 “It’s surreal,” said Janie Green, 63, who decamped with her husband Jeff to their house in St. Helena in March. As weeks of coronavirus shutdowns turned into months, they had been considering getting rid of their San Francisco apartment altogether. But on Friday, the couple returned after evacuating their Napa home.
 “The thing about life right now is that decisions are being made for us,” Green said. “You’re being guided by what’s important and necessary.”
 Californians are confronting a convergence of disasters with the wildfires, extreme weather and sudden power outages -- all alongside a pandemic that’s taken more than 12,000 lives in the state. Along with the LNU Lightning Complex that’s burning around the wine-growing regions north of San Francisco, large blazes to the east and in Santa Cruz and San Mateo counties to the south have been raging since last week, sending residents fleeing and smoke choking the Bay Area.
 People like the Greens are among the fortunate in the dire situation, yet their plight shows that no haven is entirely safe. San Francisco, like dense urban areas across the U.S., is facing the prospect that residents will flee for the long term in the pandemic, while outlying areas prosper. Rents in the city plunged 11% this month from a year earlier and condo sales are cooling. Meanwhile, contracts for home sales in Napa County almost doubled this summer, according to Compass.
 “This has temporarily entirely halted that trend,” said Deniz Kahramaner, the founder of Atlasa, a data-focused real estate brokerage based in San Francisco. “A lot of my buyers who were looking to buy in those places are now seeing the options, seeing what’s going to happen. Some of them are starting to say, ‘Well, what if we come a bit closer to San Francisco.’”
 Ginger Martin, a real estate agent for high-end homes in Napa and Sonoma counties, said she’s had an “incredibly brisk” season because of the pandemic. Last week, she was showing a $4.2 million home to prospective buyers as one of the LNU fires burned nearby. Later that evening, the neighborhood was evacuated.
 Martin said it’s too soon to say what effect the blazes will have. Business typically slows down around fire season, she said, especially after the 2017 Tubbs Fire in wine country, which destroyed more than 5,600 structures and killed 22 people. The current LNU fire has been in more remote areas, so far burning nearly 900 structures, with five deaths.
 For homebuyers, the bigger issue is insurance, she said.
 “Since the 2017 fires it’s gotten a lot harder to get really good insurance, and if you’re up in the hills where there was a fire area, it’s almost impossible or you’re paying two to three times what the norm is,” she said.
 Rental Escape
 Many of the San Francisco escapees had temporary accommodations. Anastasia Nishnevich, 30, left the city at the beginning of July with her boyfriend for a rental house in Pope Valley, a Napa town nestled among the region’s mountains and vineyards.
 “We had the feeling that we were getting the most out of the lockdown situation because it was just so beautiful,” said Nishnevich, a former Uber and Netflix engineer.
 Last Monday, a postal carrier warned her boyfriend of the Hennessey fire burning south of their rental. By Tuesday, Nishnevich saw evacuation notices for Pope Valley, sending her and her boyfriend back to their apartment in downtown San Francisco.
 How long the return will last is unclear. With smoke filling the air, it’s difficult to spend time outside, while pandemic shutdowns are still in place for indoor businesses. That’s forcing people to remain cooped up in their apartments, the very thing that drove them away from the city in the first place.
 Nishnevish and her boyfriend packed most of their items when they left Pope Valley, but kept some clothes at the rental house.
 “You’re leaving things because you want to have the hope you’ll be able to come back,” she said. In San Francisco, “everything is dead. Everything is closed.”
 The Greens also plan on returning to Napa, betting that city life isn’t going to hold its allure for a long time. Their country home -- which they operated as a bed-and-breakfast before the pandemic -- was a refuge for their kids and grandkids in recent months. At 64, Jeff, a financial adviser at Stifel Financial Corp., doubts he’ll ever have to go back to working in an office full-time.
 Also tugging the Greens back to Napa: their chickens.
 “We want to make sure they’re OK,” he said.

10,000 grants will be offered
 The Apple Valley City Council, working with the Apple Valley Economic Development Authority, has approved $400,000 to provide grants to businesses affected COVID-19.
 The council approved the funding as part of its consent agenda items during the Aug. 13 City Council meeting.
 The money is coming from nearly $4 million the city received in late July from the federal Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act. Community Development Director Bruce Nordquist said Apple Valley’s program will offer $10,000 grants to businesses demonstrating COVID-19 pandemic related expenses incurred since March 2020.
 “The objective of the program is to help business stay in business,” he said on Aug. 14. “The program is being finalized by Aug. 21, will include an online application, and have a scoring system that evaluates the business information submitted to finalize eligibility.”
 According to Nordquist, Apple Valley’s program wants to recognize business expenses that are different than how other programs have awarded funding. Grant programs proposed by state, county and other cities list eligible programs such as operating payroll, rent or lease payments, mortgage payments, utilities, suppliers and tax payments.
 Some examples of eligible expenses in Apple Valley’s program include building improvements; equipment and furnishings; personal protective equipment; sanitizing supplies; signage; employee training; transition to online sales; printing or advertising; supplies needed to restart operations or “other extraordinary costs directly related to COVID-19,” Nordquist said.
 The program requires that applicant businesses be located in Apple Valley and have a physical location in a commercial, industrial or institutional zoning district. A business must also have 50 or fewer full-time employees.
 Ineligible businesses include those not located in Apple Valley; businesses that have revenues exceeding $1.5 million in 2019; nonprofit organizations which are not 501(c)(3) or veterans organizations; home-based businesses not in the three listed zoning districts; financial institutions; publicly traded companies; businesses not making physical or other improvements to their Apple Valley location; and businesses that “derive income from passive investments, real estate transactions, except that Realtors and other realty related businesses are not categorically excluded.”
 The online application will include a process where the applicant self-selects a category and certifies the information. A database automatically scores applications based on criteria and multiple staff independently review the applications to ensure accuracy and all the intended goals are met, Nordquist said.

The Cleveland Browns certainly aren't generating the kind of hype they did last offseason, but maybe that's for the best. After Freddie Kitchens took the reins from Hue Jackson, the Browns acquired several intriguing players in free agency -- including former New York Giants wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. While he was seen as someone who could help take this offense to the postseason, he struggled to get on the same page with second-year quarterback Baker Mayfield. In 2019, Beckham caught just 74 passes for 1,035 yards and four touchdowns, the lowest numbers he's posted when playing a full 16-game season. It was also Beckham's worst catch rate of his career.
 Some of the blame can be attributed to Mayfield's play as well, as the former No. 1 overall pick completed just 59.4 percent of his passes, which ranked No. 31 in the league, and threw 21 interceptions, which were the second-most in the league last year. Mayfield understands his rapport with Beckham is going to be important moving forward, and he says that they have worked on their chemistry throughout this offseason and in training camp.
 "It's sure as hell going to be a lot better than last year," Mayfield said about his chemistry with Beckham, via NFL.com. "We're just on the same page, things we talked about. There was a lot going on within the building last year. We're not going to get into that, but we're both in a better state. He's healthy; surgery was successful, thank God. He's feeling great. He's in a great state of mind."

If returned home, Mancuso’s lawyers argue he is likely to be jailed, or even killed, despite having fulfilled his obligations under a 2003 peace deal he negotiated, which caps prison terms at eight years for militia leaders who confess their crimes.
 Mancuso, 55, was the most remorseful of the former right-wing militia leaders after demobilizing and his eagerness to discuss the paramilitaries’ war crimes has already shaken Colombia’s politics.
 His boast in 2005 that a third of Colombia’s congress was elected with paramilitary support triggered a wave of judicial investigations that ended with dozens of elected officials behind bars. His lawyers contend that others still in power have not hidden their desire to find a Colombian court to order Mancuso’s arrest in an effort to silence him.
 Colombian President Iván Duque this month called for Mancuso’s return, saying his “future should be in a Colombian jail cell” so he answers for “crimes against humanity.” Mancuso’s lawyers argued

 Yaron believes the risks Temi poses are small, given its relative simplicity. “The more abilities you add for the robot to do harm then it can become more dangerous. If a robot had arms and hands, it could maybe pick up a knife or break a bunch of things.”
 And if life-sized Rock 'Em Sock 'Em robots sounds far fetched, think again. In 2017, a team from cybersecurity firm IOActive managed to break into Pepper, a popular social humanoid machine that can recognise faces and human emotion. Pepper also has arms which hackers were able to remotely access and control, turning any Pepper into a 1.2 metre tall Anthony Joshua that won’t stop punching until the battery goes flat.
 Few reliable studies have been made into the effects of fighting robots on retirees, and besides, Pepper’s arms are too slow to inflict any considerable damage. Hacks on a grand scale are sparse too as many domestic or workplace robots are used in controlled areas, reducing potential risks.
 But as governments search for more ways of stopping the spread of Covid-19 and businesses rush to respond, there risks are growing. “As we move more into a touchless society personal assistants and robots are going to become more important targets,” says McKee. “They become larger targets because they produce a larger impact, so as consumers we need to consider the security impact of the convenience we’re looking for. Is it worth it? Just because it can be internet connected, does it need to be?”

 “We have also added several providers to our practice to accommodate the increase and expand on our specialties and offered services,” he added.
 Ohayon said Doctegrity is a little different from the normal provider. As some providers help their doctors get their offices online, he explained Doctegrity is kind of like “Uber for doctors.” Patients can explain they’re feeling sick, list their symptoms and get connected to a doctor to write a prescription or discuss the next steps. Because of their model, Ohayon said engagement was already good, but the pandemic has increased patient requests.
 “For us, they don’t have to go anywhere at all, people can basically just use any smartphone, dial in and just call us,” he explained. “We can call them back and talk through their issues. At the end of the day, because we’re using board-certified physicians, they’re seeing the same quality of service that they would at an office or emergency room.”

On Sunday night, police shot 29-year-old Jacob Blake, a Black man, in the back multiple times as he was opening the door of a parked car in Kenosha, Wisconsin. The attorney retained by Blake's family, Benjamin Crump, says Blake's three children were in the car at the time of the shooting. Crump added that Blake was trying to de-escalate a fight between two others at the scene and that when the police officers arrived, they drew their weapons and tased Blake.
 Blake was hospitalized after the shooting and is in serious condition. In a statement, Crump said, "We will seek justice for Jacob Blake and for his family as we demand answers from the Kenosha Police Department."
 Wisconsin governor Tony Evers released a statement, saying that Blake was "shot in the back multiple times, in broad daylight."
 "While we do not have all of the details yet, what we know for certain is that he is not the first Black man or person to have been shot or injured or mercilessly killed at the hands of individuals in law enforcement in our state or our country," Evers said.

Bloomberg) -- China’s Dajia Insurance Group knew there were questions about the ownership of some U.S. luxury hotels they put up for sale last year but didn’t tell more than a dozen first-round bidders, a lawyer testified in the trial over whether Mirae Asset Global Investments Co. can get out of the deal.Stephen Glover, one of the attorneys hired by Dajia to oversee the auction of a portfolio of famed hotels such as the Westin St. Francis in San Francisco and the Loews Santa Monica Beach Hotel, said in the Delaware Chancery Court trial his team wanted to “get their arms around” the problem of phony deeds filed to the properties before they disclosed them.
 “We wanted to squash this as quickly and effectively as possible,” Glover told Judge Travis Laster Monday at the start of the trial over the busted-deal case. “It doesn’t make sense to talk with buyers about the problem until you have” a plan to deal with it, the attorney added. He said Dajia informed the two final bidders, including Mirae, in August 2019.Mirae, which bought the portfolio for $5.8 billion the following month, canceled the deal in May, arguing Dajia violated the purchase agreement by withholding information about the alleged deed scam as part of a cover up designed to ram the deal through.Dajia, which assumed most of the assets of struggling Chinese insurer Anbang Insurance Group Co., says it satisfied all terms of the sale and that it should have closed in April as scheduled.
 ‘Cold Feet’
 The buyout is among nearly 20 transactions that have fallen apart so far this year, many of which cite the Covid-19 pandemic as one of the causes. Mirae also points to the coronavirus’ decimation of the hotel industry as another reason to pull out of the multi-billion-dollar deal.“I think fundamentally, they got cold feet,” Glover testified via an electronic system because Delaware courts are closed to in-person testimony. “They were very nervous about this transaction in an environment where hotel business was suffering generally and financing had become more expensive,” he added.
 According to Glover, Dajia contacted 55 prospective buyers about the hotel portfolio, 17 of which actually submitted bids. Dajia winnowed that to a final group including Mirae.Glover said Mirae executives weren’t put off when they were notified about concerns over phony title transfers to six California hotels in the portfolio and determined “it shouldn’t be an issue.” Mirae instead agreed to a “litigation plan” that succeeded in getting the phony California deeds thrown out before the deal’s closing date.
 The hotels were bought by Wu Xiaohui, ex-CEO of Anbang, as part of an $18 billion buying binge starting in 2014. The Chinese government jailed Wu on fraud and embezzlement charges four years later and seized the hotels.

 Prior to Wu’s jailing, he signed an agreement empowering four Delaware shell companies to sue on his behalf if the hotels were expropriated by the government. Dajia contends the agreement is fictitious and that it never agreed to Wu’s claims to the properties.Dajia contends a group of “fraudsters” used a 26-year-old Uber driver to file phony transfers of title to the California hotels to the shell companies. The group then set up arbitration panels under a Delaware law that issued awards totalling $936 billion over the hotel seizures. Laster later threw those awards out after the shell companies didn’t show up to defend them.
 On cross-examination, Mirae lawyer Andrew Rossman pointed out that, while Dajia officials alerted Mirae about the California title transfers, it never mentioned other members of the alleged scam, including a figure going by the name Andy Bang.
 Dajia also didn’t say the Delaware companies were still trying to enforce the arbitration awards at the time, Rossman said. Mirae only learned that from lawyers at Goldman Sachs & Co., one of the financial advisers on the deal.
 Dajia didn’t mention the Delaware litigation because it “was a sideshow,” Glover said. “It was another difficult-to-explain element to the fraudulent effort.”
 The busted-deal case is AB Stable VIII LLC v. MAPS Hotel and Resorts One LLC, No. 2020-0310, Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington). The arbitration-award dispute is World Award Foundation Inc. v. Anbang Insurance Group Co., No. 2020-0605.

My dad taught me to grab opportunity and think outside the box every chance you can get. I very fondly recall his “pool story.” My dad immigrated to India halfway through college and graduated from New Jersey Institute of Technology top of his class. He was offered a job at Boeing but after 2 years of being told that the only way to get the corner office was to stay with the company 20+ years, he decided to leave to pursue more opportunity. His brother had a motel in Rome, Georgia and offered my dad the opportunity to run the motel. My dad learned a lot but happened to notice that the hotel had a very large pool in the center of the property. And if you’ve ever been to Georgia in the summer- it’s sweltering. Rome was a very small town that had one community pool that charged $1 for entrance and it was always packed. My dad figured he would charge people $2 a person and offer a less crowded experience. He was right! In the early 80s he was bringing in $200/day in pool entrance fees! He saved up enough money that he was able to buy his own hotel. Through this story my dad would share the lesson- Look for opportunities. Sometimes they are in front of your very eyes. 😊

Right now, the ingenious snow-generating system, which uses gravity to feed the sprinkler-like system from lakes further up the mountains and thus can be operated without electricity, is being developed by the Lucerne-based snow machine company Bächler, which has also patented the technology.
 Meanwhile, Keller and Oerlemans’ glacier-building scheme is entering a second, crucial stage. Thanks to a CHF2.5 million (£2.1 million) grant the Swiss Agency for Innovation Promotion awarded to the project in October 2019, the researchers are working out details to run a second, larger-scale pilot project that will go on for 30 months at a site nearby the Diavolezza cable car, where the Morteratsch once stretched. “We’ve crossed a critical threshold,” Keller says. “This is no longer just on paper; it’s taking place for real.”
 Keller hopes to generate interest in the idea not just in Switzerland and Europe, but also other parts of the world such as Latin America and the Himalayas, where hundreds of millions depend on glacier-fed rivers to drink or irrigate crops. “The system could potentially work anywhere,” claims Keller. “But at a local level it could prove invaluable for those communities that rely on meltwater from glaciers for their survival.”
 Not everyone is convinced that the plan can provide a viable solution to glacier recession across the world, though. Daniel Farinotti, a glaciologist at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich, says that while the method has certainly some potential to ease ice melt locally, “saving an entire glacier is a completely different undertaking as it poses enormous challenges related to scalability and involves unreasonable costs for many – if not all – countries around the world.”
