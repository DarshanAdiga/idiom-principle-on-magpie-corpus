Carmen Tănase a vorbit încă o dată despre subiectul care ne copleșește în aceste vremuri, dar în special despre efectele sale asupra copiilor. Cunoscuta actriță a susținut în cursul zilei de miercuri, la Sintena Zilei, că totul pare un plan bine pus la punct, iar minorii sunt cei mai afectați pentru că își vor forma diferit personalitatea față de generațiile trecute din cauza restricțiilor impuse de către oficiali.

O-R editorial on legalizing pot misguided          The Aug. 29 editorial supporting Governor Wolf’s proposal to legalize recreational marijuana is misguided. An obvious benefit is the license and tax revenue that would be generated, and the governor wants some of the money for small businesses hurt by his imposed COVID restrictions, and some for restorative justice programs for communities affected by marijuana arrests and convictions. The first reason is just an easy way to mitigate the harm his discriminatory shutdown policies have already done, and restorative justice programs are primarily for criminals who use violence in the commission of a crime. Statistics show most arrests involving marijuana possession involve nonviolent offenses. Why the governor believes these arrests hurt communities is not clear.          Some important issues to consider: There is much evidence that smoking marijuana causes impairment. Short-term effects include distorted perception, memory and learning problems, loss of coordination, and trouble with problem solving. Long-term effects include lung damage, changes in brain function and anxiety and depression. Marijuana smoke contains ammonia, hydrogen cyanide, and formaldehyde, and increases the risk of asthma and heart attack. Second-hand marijuana smoke is as dangerous as tobacco smoke.          Second, in 2019 more than 22,000 Pennsylvanians were arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol and/or illegal drugs, and there were over 10,000 alcohol-related vehicle crashes. The cost in lives and property is enormous. What could be a logical rationale for having more impaired people on our roadways and putting more demands on police?

The somewhat ambiguous criteria for what constitutes “advocacy” renders this an extremely difficult question to answer. But sometimes public agencies and their communications consultants cross a line obvious enough to earn them a slap on the wrist. But it doesn’t happen very often, and the consequences are minimal.

In light of these safety concerns, the SARMs Control Act of 2019 was introduced to the United States Congress, which seeks to tighten regulatory control over these drugs. This act effectively equates SARMs with anabolic steroids on a regulatory level. This type of regulation is necessary to help contain a drug with health risks and potential for abuse.

The scope of this ruling is laughable. Measure H, which was a voter-approved 1/4 cent sales tax increase, will generate an estimated $355 million a year for ten years to fight homelessness. As an aside, that is more than enough money to cure homelessness in Los Angeles County if they’d restore laws and penalties to curb vagrancy, petty theft, and public intoxication, and build supervised tent shelters in inexpensive parts of the county. But instead, anything goes in woke Los Angeles, and corrupt developers are making billions, building “homeless supportive housing” at an average cost of $500,000 per unit. Measure H, like most homeless initiatives in woke locales across America, is a lucrative scam for developers and a magnet for more homeless. This is a failed model in a failing county.

Seaver died in his sleep of complications of Lewy body dementia and COVID-19, according to a release from the Baseball Hall of Fame on Wednesday night.          Seaver, nicknamed "Tom Terrific," won three Cy Young Awards. A former National League Rookie of the Year, Seaver went to the All-Star Game 12 times in his 20-year career. He won the NL ERA title three times.           In 1969, he achieved the greatest team accomplishment as he won a World Series with the Mets. He helped transform the franchise into one that was respected around baseball after so many years of losing after its inception.           “I am deeply saddened by the death of Tom Seaver, one of the greatest pitchers of all-time," Major League Baseball commissioner Rob Manfred said in a statement. "Tom was a gentleman who represented the best of our National Pastime.  He was synonymous with the New York Mets and their unforgettable 1969 season. After their improbable World Series Championship, Tom became a household name to baseball fans – a responsibility he carried out with distinction throughout his life."          Seaver, who also played for the Cincinnati Reds, Chicago White Sox and Boston Red Sox, finished his career with a 2.86 ERA and 311 victories. He struck out 3,640 batters.           Seaver threw a no-hitter for the Reds against the St. Louis Cardinals on June 16, 1978, at Riverfront Stadium after tossing five one-hitters.           "Tom Seaver was one of the best and most inspirational pitchers to play the game," Reds owner Bob Castellini said. "We are grateful that Tom's Hall of Fame career included time with the Reds. We are proud to count his name among the greats in the Reds Hall of Fame. He will be missed."          In 1988, the Mets retired Seaver's No. 41 during a ceremony at Shea Stadium. He was elected into the Hall of Fame in 1992 after appearing on 98.8 percent of ballots submitted by members in the Baseball Writers' Association of America.           His family had announced he was diagnosed with dementia in March 2019 and that he was retiring from public life.           “We are heartbroken to share that our beloved husband and father has passed away,” his wife Nancy Seaver and daughters Sarah and Anne said in a statement. “We send our love out to his fans, as we mourn his loss with you.”           _Justin Toscano is the Mets beat writer for NorthJersey.com.
