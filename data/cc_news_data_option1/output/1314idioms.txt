L'iPad compie 10 anni. Era il 3 aprile del 2010 quando la tavoletta della Mela arrivò per la prima volta sugli scaffali lanciando un prodotto - il tablet - che oggi è una presenza costante tra i dispositivi hi-tech, accanto a telefono e computer.


  L'iPad era stato mostrato al mondo per la prima volta il 27 gennaio 2010 da Steve Jobs, che su un palco di San Francisco aveva svelato la novità davanti a un pubblico piuttosto scettico. All'epoca non si riusciva a immaginare a cosa potesse servire uno schermo più grande di un telefono, ma che non funzionava come un telefono, e che non aveva una tastiera per scrivere come un portatile. Una via di mezzo tra uno smartphone e un pc, apparentemente senza una ragione d'uso.


  A fornire quella ragione fu Jobs, presentando il primo iPad come l'oggetto che offriva "la migliore esperienza di navigazione in rete", oltre ad avere uno schermo abbastanza ampio (9,7 pollici) per poter leggere bene email e ebook, sfogliare foto, guardare filmati e giocare ai videogame. Non una via di mezzo, ma una terza categoria di prodotto.


  Nel primo giorno di vendita gli iPad acquistati furono 300 mila, e in meno di due mesi superarono i due milioni, per chiudere il 2010 a quota 7,5 milioni di unità. L'anno successivo raggiunsero i 32 milioni, poi 58 milioni nel 2012, e nel 2013 - l'anno migliore - 71 milioni. Ad oggi la cifra ha superato i 350 milioni.


  Nel frattempo l'iPad è cambiato, si è fatto Air, Mini e Pro con diverse dimensioni e caratteristiche, ha aggiunto una matita per disegnare e una tastiera staccabile per scrivere, si è dotato di un proprio sistema operativo e si è candidato a sostituire il pc. "Il tuo prossimo computer non è un computer" è il claim dell'ultimo iPad Pro, lanciato sul mercato appena una settimana fa.

As millions across the globe shelter in place, I wonder how many are pondering the state of our world, our accomplishments and failures, life and death in this uncertain time, and our understanding of the universal spirit energy that connects us all.


  Two stories come to mind. In “Autobiography of a Yogi,” Hindu master Paramahansa Yogananda taught about faith, spirituality and self-realization. When he took the long journey to meet his most enlightened teacher, Hindu master Sri Yukteswar, Yogananda came to a crossroad, and was unsure which road to take.


  There was an old man sitting on a bench. He asked the man if he knew the way. The old man kindly gave him directions. Yogananda thanked him and went on his way. When he arrived at his destination, the man who greeted him, his teacher, was the old man on the bench! Yukteswar’s enlightened spirit had projected across the expanse to give his student directions.

UK's FTSE 100 was on course for its fifth weekly decline in six on Friday as insurers tumbled after their European Union counterparts were asked to suspend dividend payments to weather the economic hit from the coronavirus pandemic. The blue-chip index fell 1.2%, with shares in Legal & General, Aviva and Prudential down between 4.4% and 7.0% after the EU regulator asked insurers and reinsurers to temporarily suspend dividends and share buybacks.


  "The action from the European Central Bank and the Bank of England in relation to bank dividend should have been a warning for insurers," CMC Markets analyst David Madden said. "In this day and age, you want to make sure that you're as liquid as possible." With many firms announcing freezes or cuts in their payout policies notably in the banking sector, Barclays on Wednesday forecast that dividend paid by companies listed on the pan-European STOXX 600 index will fall by about 40% this year.


  The domestically focused midcap index dropped 1.3%, with shares of information services provider Ascential tumbling 7.4% as it scrapped its 2019 dividend and said it was commercially not viable to run the Cannes Lions Festival this year. Both the major indexes are on course to log weekly losses as data from across the world confirmed investor fears of a sharp economic slump driven by the virus outbreak.


  After Thursday's numbers showed another record surge in U.S. weekly jobless claims, investors are awaiting employment data that is expected to show the U.S. economy shed jobs in March. "I don't think it's going to have a lasting impact on the market, just because traders know that the situation is bad and is going to become dire," CMC's Madden said.


  Meanwhile, UK's services sectors activity suffered its biggest slump by far since 1996, a survey showed, with much of the economy in a shutdown. Shares in BP and Royal Dutch Shell fell slightly as oil prices reversed early losses, with hopes of a huge global supply cut deal between Saudi Arabia and Russia to support prices still alive.


  Defence company BAE Systems dropped 2.3% on deferring a decision on whether to pay its dividend and said it had launched cost control measures after seeing significant disruption. London's bus operators First Group, Go-Ahead Group , National Express and Stagecoach Group gained between 2% and 5% as they welcomed 167 million pounds in aid from the government to keep commuter services running for essential staff.

ANKARA -- More than two million workers in Turkey have lost their jobs due to measures taken to contain the coronavirus outbreak and the government needs to do more to support them, the main opposition party said on Friday.


  President Tayyip Erdogan's government has ordered retailers, restaurants and other businesses to close but has not imposed a full lockdown, as the main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP) has requested.


  CHP Chairman Kemal Kilicdaroglu said around 400,000 businesses had closed over the measures, which had also left many workers paid wages day by day, such as school bus drivers and barbers, unemployed.


  "The number of those who worked there and are now unemployed exceeds 2 million. They will get unemployment wages from the unemployment fund for a short time, but there are no guarantees after that," he told Fox TV in an interview.


  The first official data showing the impact of the epidemic on Turkey's workforce will not be published until May, when March unemployment figures are released.


  To date COVID-19 has killed more than 350 in the country, with confirmed cases topping 18,000.


  Ankara has also rolled out a 100-billion lira ($15 billion) support package for the economy and launched a donation campaign to gather funds for the needy, which the directorate of communications said overnight had raised 847 million lira.


  "We urged the government to take precautions for dayworkers. No measures were taken," Kilicdaroglu said, adding the AK Party government had to "make sacrifices" instead of launching a donation campaign.

La dotazione e prevista dal regolamento comunale che disciplina l'attivita del Corpo, ha lo scopo di fungere da distanziatore di sicurezza, con una lunghezza variabile tra i 30 e i 60 centimetri ed e stata fortemente voluta per tenere ad opportuna distanza eventuali soggetti aggressivi, evitare contatti e risse.

4 TRILLION BILL FOR CRISIS? The Asian Development Bank forecasts that the coronavirus pandemic will cost the world economy as much as $4.1 trillion, or nearly 5% of all economic activity. The regional lender said Friday that growth in developing Asia would likely fall to 2.2% in 2020 from 5.2% last year. The Manila, Philippines-based bank said that Southeast Asia, a market of more than 600 million that has been rapidly growing, will likely log 1% growth this year. China, the region’s biggest economy, saw double-digit contractions in business activity in January-February and will likely see growth fall to 2.3% this year from a three-decade low of 6.1% in 2019, the ADB said. China's losses from shutdowns and other costs due to the pandemic could add up to $692 billion if containment efforts drag on. But the ADB estimated that growth would bounce back next year to more than 7%.

Regarding the story “Pandemic fuels trend toward smaller, simpler funerals” in the March 31 edition, the price of funerals in Japan is outrageous. If ¥500,000 is considered cheap, and “cheaper alternatives” include a ¥253,000 one-day funeral that skips the wake, bodies will start piling up in the streets if the coronavirus continues to rage on for months. I myself can’t afford these prices. I come from California where one can be cremated and have one’s ashes tossed at sea for less than $500.


  Less expensive services are needed in Japan before the situation gets desperate.

 I hope and pray that, after all this virus saga, Marseille will try to organise something for Pape.
 If that is being done, I think people will see how Pape is loved all over the world.
 He went above race, colour, religion, whatever you can name. He was respected across the board. He was a big, big, big personality.
 He opened a door and put the bar very high for all of us to emulate what he has achieved and what he has done.
 The most disappointing and difficult moment for us is that because of this virus we cannot say bye to Pape. Whether in Senegal or in France, we cannot be at the grave and share the pain with some of his close family.

European stock markets headed lower on Friday, erasing meagre gains for the week, as more companies flagged a hit to business from the coronavirus pandemic, foreshadowing a deeper earnings recession ahead of the reporting season. The pan-European STOXX 600 index fell 0.5%, with insurers tumbling 3% after a European Union regulator asked them to suspend dividends and share buybacks to shore up liquidity, as a halt in business activity crushes consumer demand and sparks mass layoffs.


  "We are entering a climate with lower or no dividends, fewer financial options, but most importantly, fewer jobs and lower output," said Stephen Innes, a strategist at AxiCorp. "Many small- and large-sized businesses will not survive this storm."


  H&M;, the world's second-biggest clothing retailer, reported a 46% plunge in March sales and said it expected a loss in its fiscal second quarter. However, the company's shares, which have lost 40% of their value since end January, jumped 7% as it said was taking steps to strengthen its liquidity buffer and cut operating expenses.


  With more than 1 million people now infected around the world and countries extending national lockdowns, economists expect euro area real GDP to shrink as much as 43% in the second quarter. Macroeconomic figures are starting to reflect the extent of the economic damage from the health crisis, with U.S. jobless claims blowing past a record 6 million last week. In Spain, about 900,000 workers have lost their jobs since mid March.


  "Global recession fears are now being confirmed by the incoming economic prints," said Han Tan, market analyst at FXTM. "Until the virus case count peaks and the business earnings outlook improves, risk sentiment may only experience fleeting bouts of positivity."


  The STOXX 600 index is still down about 28% — or $3.5 trillion in market value — from its mid-February record highs despite a rebound last week that was powered by aggressive monetary and fiscal stimulus from around the world. Travel & leisure stocks lost about 0.1%, as the industry braced for a long road to recovery with fresh data showing international seat capacity dropping by almost 80% from a year ago and half the world's airplanes in storage.


  Energy stocks tracked a slide in oil prices as investors grew doubtful about a Saudi-Russia deal that U.S. President Donald Trump said he had brokered. Britain's BAE Systems fell 2% after saying it would defer a decision on whether to pay its dividend and launching cost control measures following significant disruption from the virus outbreak.

The corona virus pandemic challenges our faith in God. As each day passes, we are more aware of the fragility of life, and we become more thankful for simple things we’d never noticed before. We can only ask so much of God, and try to shoulder some of the burden ourselves.


  We can ask God to protect us, but that is made easier while wearing masks, goggles and gloves.


  We can ask God to take us under his sheltering wing, but it is safer to do so while standing six feet apart.


  We can believe in an all-powerful God, who will save us, but it helps if we can get our government to increase the production of ventilators, because without those ventilators, doctors will be forced to play God, and decide who lives and who dies.


  We can ask for a miracle, or we can make sure everyone in our household washes their hands in warm water and soap to break down the fatty layer on the virus and kill it.


  We can scan copies of the Book of Job, study Why Bad Things Happen to Good People, and try to figure out why the universe is conspiring against us, or we can look at the science behind what is happening and use that knowledge to assure ourselves we are not being punished, nor tested, by any deity.


  The next few months will be a whirlwind of chaos, as one after another, our weaknesses are exposed. Our lives will be increasingly difficult, and we have no idea what the world will be like when a vaccine arrives and the pandemic is beaten down. As a nation we have great sadness ahead of us, great economic and social turmoil.


  To weather the storm, we can turn to God for comfort through meditation and prayer. We can act as God’s agents by finding ways to volunteer, to donate, or just be a comforting and reassuring voice on the phone. And amazing as it may sound, there won’t be a family in America left untouched by this moment in history.

Hannah Koch, an administrator for the Victoria branch of the site, understands the pressure doctors have been under since the outbreak took hold. Her brother works in a hospital and her mother is a GP.


  "We can't help them do their jobs because we are not skilled, but we can do the grocery shopping for them and I can offer to babysit my brother's kid when he has to pick up an extra shift," she said.


  "There's fear but there's also support, and that's all they can ask for — and stay home," she added with a laugh. "Please, please, please stay home."


  The help on offer includes mowing lawns, household chores, delivering home- cooked meals and lifts to work for nurses so they don't have to take public transport.


  Cards and children's drawings saying thank you to "healthcare heroes" have also been collected through the site, for display on the windows and entrances of COVID-19 wards where deliveries of other gifts cannot be received.


  "I want to say a huge thank you for the many beautiful messages and offers of assistance I received," wrote adoptee Linda Yate.


  "Offers to shop for me, cook and drop off meals, and offers of the chance to touch base with someone to just have a friendly chat and many, many more … . The generosity of everyone is so humbling."


  Dozens of other outreach groups have formed in recent weeks via Facebook, WhatsApp, and Chinese social media app Weibo to support the sick, needy and those in isolation.


  On one such Facebook group — Northside Melbourne Coronavirus Outreach — people offered food, groceries, homemade soaps, sanitary items and thermometers.


  Others offered to run errands, provide free IT support to those trying to adjust to working from home or give online fitness and relaxation classes.


  "The love pouring out of this page is everything right in our world," wrote one recipient.


  Sikh temples across Melbourne have also become centers of support for both medical workers and those self-isolating.


  "We are trying to help all people who are in isolation or anyone who's having difficulty getting groceries… especially the health workers," said Manjit Singh.


  "Some of them are coming home after 12-hour shifts, and all they want to do is sleep and they haven't got time to cook. So we're trying to provide food for them, so we can try and look after them while they look after us."


  At the Gurdwara Sahib in Plumpton — a Sikh place of gathering and worship on the outskirts of Melbourne — Singh and a small group of volunteers packed home-cooked food and other goods to fill orders across the city.


  Increasing restrictions on large gatherings have required constant adjustments to how they operate, with much of the food now being prepared at home and packed at the center by volunteer delivery drivers.


  Singh said ensuring "no person will go hungry and no person will go naked" is part of the Sikh philosophy.

4 TRILLION BILL FOR CRISIS? The Asian Development Bank forecasts that the coronavirus pandemic will cost the world economy as much as $4.1 trillion, or nearly 5% of all economic activity. The regional lender said Friday that growth in developing Asia would likely fall to 2.2% in 2020 from 5.2% last year. The Manila, Philippines-based bank said that Southeast Asia, a market of more than 600 million that has been rapidly growing, will likely log 1% growth this year. China, the region’s biggest economy, saw double-digit contractions in business activity in January-February and will likely see growth fall to 2.3% this year from a three-decade low of 6.1% in 2019, the ADB said. China's losses from shutdowns and other costs due to the pandemic could add up to $692 billion if containment efforts drag on. But the ADB estimated that growth would bounce back next year to more than 7%.

"I voted for Modi in all the elections but now I'm very sure that he works only for the big people and not for a man like me," Gupta told Reuters in the northern town of Lucknow where he was getting on a truck for the next leg of his journey home.


  The shutdown has dealt a body blow to India's neediest, many of whom have long backed Modi, the 69-year old son of a tea seller whose Hindu nationalist administration was first elected in 2014.


  Thousands of desperate day labourers like Gupta have walked hundreds of miles home - and more than 20 have reportedly died on the way. In slums, anxious families are low on food, while homeless shelters are overflowing.


  Modi says the lockdown is necessary to avert a humanitarian calamity in India, where healthcare has long been weak and millions live in crowded, unsanitary conditions.

For a four-sport athlete like Centennial High School's Chazz Vigil, the question was never would he sign at the next level.


   


  Instead, it was more about which sport.


   


  The Bulldogs senior has been a standout in golf, tennis, basketball and baseball, leaving him quite a few options.


   


  Ultimately, the three-time state golf qualifier decided to stay on the links and play for Johnson and Wales starting next fall.


   


  "I always thought I wanted to play baseball in college, but I started taking golf pretty seriously about my sophomore year," Vigil said. "February, I visited the campus again and this time I made up my mind that this was the place for me because of the people that were there, the location of the campus and it's a small university, which I like."


   


  Small would be the opposite description of the impact sports have had on Vigil during his time at Centennial.


   


  Vigil also qualified for the state tennis tournament in the fall, marking the second time in his prep career he qualified for state golf and tennis in the same fall season.


   


  This season, he led the Bulldogs basketball team in scoring and was set to be one of a few returners for the Centennial baseball team that qualified for regionals in 2019.


   


  "My experience in all of the sports at Centennial really helped me to have a good work ethic in not only sports, but in school too," Vigil said. "Also, I played individual and team sports, so I know how to handle myself in the team aspect and the individual aspect in sports, as well as the classroom."


   


  Vigil wasn't alone on the Bulldogs' signing day on March 10 either.


   


  Senior Devin Blue committed to play football at Western Colorado University. And baseball players Louie Martinez and Joseph Solano signed to play at Presentation College (S.D.) and Ottawa University (KS).


   


  "It was really cool because I actually play baseball with all of them," Vigil said on sigining with his three fellow Bulldogs. "Also my best friend Louie Martinez was up there with me signing to play baseball ... that was really cool to see both of us going on to the next level for sports."


   


  Centennial wasn't alone either as a group of East players made the move up to college official this spring as well.


   


  Marvin London Jr and Jack Helzer are staying home to play football at CSU- Pueblo as well as AJ Braach, who is a preferred walk-on for the Thunderwolves.


   


  Nasya Madrid and Delaney Barela will continue their softball careers at Lamar Community College and CSU-Pueblo, respectively.


   


  Baseball will be represented by Nico Cristelli and Keith Meyer as they head to Webster (MO) and Midland (NE) universities.


   


  Last but certainly not least are a couple wrestlers with Aaden Valdez staying close to home with a commitment to Adams State in Alamosa.


   


  Four-time state champion Andy Garcia is sure to be heading to the next level, but is still undecided on where.

Meanwhile, the Topix index of all first-section issues shed 4.74 points, or 0.36 percent, to end at 1,325.13, after dropping 21.21 points the previous day.


  Stocks spurted in the early morning, with sentiment brightened by the yen's weakening against the dollar, a Wall Street rebound and New York crude oil futures' rally on the back of growing hopes for an oil output curb agreement between Saudi Arabia and Russia, brokers said.


  The Tokyo market soon lost steam, as investors renewed their concerns over the coronavirus crisis in view of spikes in the number of people infected with virus in Japan, the United States and other parts of the world.


  Both the Nikkei and Topix indexes were pulled down into negative territory by a drop in U.S. Dow Jones index futures in off-hours trading in the early afternoon and moved on a weak tone toward the closing bell.


  Bracing for the Japanese government's possible declaration of a state of emergency to prevent the virus from spreading further, investors stepped up moves to square equity-long positions ahead of the weekend, brokers said.


  But in the final minutes of the day's trading the Nikkei was buoyed by buybacks prompted by the Dow futures paring losses, they added.


  Selling pressure built up in the afternoon as investors increasingly "feared" that U.S. stocks would tumble following the release later on Friday of the closely watched employment report by the government for March and of the Institute for Supply Management's nonmanufacturing index for the same month, both of which were expected to show substantial deterioration, Yutaka Miura, senior technical analyst at Mizuho Securities Co., said.


  Maki Sawada, vice president of Nomura Securities Co.'s Investment Research & Investor Services Department, said that the market was also weighed down by drops in the Chinese markets.


  On the first section, falling issues far outnumbered rising ones 1,653 to 467 while 48 issues were unchanged. Volume decreased to 1.499 billion shares from Thursday's 1.644 billion shares.


  Crude oil-linked Inpex and Japex jumped 2.63 percent and 2.08 percent, respectively.


  Denka Co. skyrocketed 24.03 percent, thanks to the chemical firm's announcement that it will in May start producing an ingredient for Fujifilm Holdings Corp.'s Avigan influenza drug, now under a clinical trial to check its safety and efficacy in treating coronavirus patients.


  Other major winners were clothing store chain Fast Retailing Co. and air conditioner-maker Daikin Industries.


  On the other hand, pub chain Torikizoku Co. plummeted by 14.85 pct and industry peer Kushikatsu Tanaka Holdings Co. by 9.78 pct, due to their decisions to halt business operations amid the virus scare.


  In index futures trading on the Osaka Exchange, the key June contract on the Nikkei average plunged 180 points to end at 17,680.

Just one week before Stielow was scheduled to be electrocuted on December 11, 1916, the Governor of New York called for a reinvestigation. A firearms expert from the New York City police department compared the bullets from the murder scene with those test-fired from Stielow’s gun. Even by eye, the markings on the two sets of bullets did not look similar but to make certain, optician Max Poser studied them under the microscope. The bullets from the murder scene could not have been fired from Stielow’s gun, he declared.
