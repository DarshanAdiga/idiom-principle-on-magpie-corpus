How we watch movies is one of many things that have changed this year. While you could buy a giant 4K TV and stream _Bill & Ted Face the Music_, movies on your couch gets old pretty quick. Until we all feel safe to go to movie theaters, a quick way to shake things up is with a portable mini projector that allows you to watch your favorite movies and shows in the great outdoors.

"Ryan Allen is having an outstanding freshmen year so far," Saladin said. "He's been our lead runner for two of the four races - switching on and off with Anthony Kiaunis. He has a very consistent pace and great cadence while running. He put a lot of work in over the summer and it's showing up early in the season. He's going to continue to improve and I think we'll see some low 17s and maybe breaking into high 16s by the end of the year.

WASHINGTON, Sept 15 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday he was not aware of the World Trade Organization ruling on a trade dispute with China but said he would take a look at it.
 Trump reiterated that he was not a fan of the WTO, which said on Tuesday that the United States had breached global trading rules by imposing multi-billion dollar tariffs in Trump's trade war with China.
 Asked about the decision as he left the White House, Trump said he had not seen it.
 "Then we'll have to do something about the WTO because they've let China get away with murder," he said.
 "We'll take a look at that. But I'm not a big fan of the WTO - that I can tell you right now. Maybe they did us a big favor." (Reporting by Steve Holland; Writing by Doina Chiacu; Editing by Chris Reese and Dan Grebler)

So, if we can get game time in them then it is important.
 “We all want to win and do well in the cups but we have just got to be sensible because, at the end of the day, we are going to be judged on our league form. Hopefully we can keep that going.”

As a result of the settlement current and former owners of the affected vehicles, including Mercedes-Benz passenger vans from the 2009 through 2016 model years and Freightliner Sprinters with BlueTEC II emission control systems from the 2010 through 2016 model years, could receive up to $3,290 each. In addition, their vehicles would get software and hardware updates to change certain emissions functions as part of a fix. However, the automaker will not be required to buy back any vehicles -- a major distinction from the Volkswagen diesel settlement's outcome.  
 The investigation into Mercedes diesels dates back almost to the outbreak of the Volkswagen diesel crisis in 2015, though there are several important differences in actions and scope. What they have in common is that the Department of Justice stated that the EPA and the California Air Resources Board discovered defeat devices in Mercedes-Benz vehicles, allowing them to produce greater nitrogen oxide emissions when driven on the road, as opposed to a testing stand.

On the party's decision to file for a recount, even though Azan had initially indicated that he was not minded to do so, he said: "Well, Mr Mr Azan lost by just under a hundred votes and when it is stated that there are over a thousand rejected ballots, then any card can play. He may very well turn out to be the victor, or Mr Henriques may extend his lead, we don't know; but when you have a situation where you lost by under 100 votes and then the number of rejected ballots is 10 times or more what you lost by, then you're in for a penny, in for a pound.

“Without tasting the wines, without getting to know the winemakers personally, you really never know” the quality, she said. “I put my seal of approval on the wines I import and put in my portfolio because I have that level of confidence in the people who make them.”
 “All my imported wines are exclusive to me,” Snow added, noting the bottles she selects are not found elsewhere.
 She loves being able to expose her customers to new wines, she added. “It’s a project of passion.”
 “One of the things that makes DOCG unique is our connection to the island of Sardegna [Sardinia],” Snow said. The second-largest Mediterranean island, after Sicily, is “so rich in history and culture,” she said. In 2003, she bought a home there where she and her daughter have spent every summer, aside from this year.
 Sardinian winemaking is an “ancient tradition,” Snow said. “[Sardinian] wines are something I have a particular affinity for.”
 Sardinian wines make up 30 percent of Snow’s portfolio, which she said “makes me very unique in Italian wine imports in general.”
 Snow has grown DOCG Imports to provide wholesale wine to more than 50 restaurants and wine shops in San Diego, as well as an online retail portion for individuals.
 DOCG Imports also offers imported Italian olive oil, along with private tastings and wine dinners, which currently are social-distanced in accord with health and safety guidelines.
 “We are also hyper-present on social media,” answering questions about food pairings and wine definitions, along with showcasing some of the wines in the DOCG Imports portfolio, Snow said.
 Snow also just launched the La Jolla Wine Club, which offers members monthly or quarterly shipments of imported wines, as well as first dibs on a Sardinian wine tour that Snow hopes to schedule for next summer.

But in order to give everyone a chance to get tickets, the fair is holding a lottery this time. The first parade sold out in a matter of a few hours, and many eager fans were left disappointed by a crashing website.
 If you want to go to the second event, which will be Oct. 1-4 and Oct. 8-11, you have to register for the ticket lottery by noon on Thursday, Sept. 17.
 Participating food vendors include: Turkey to Go, Fresh French Fries, Mouth Trap Cheese Curds, Que Viet, Sweets & Treats, Pronto Pups, Tom Thumb Donuts, West Indies Soul Food, Minneapple Pie, Hansen’s Foot Long Hot Dogs & Corn Dogs, Butcher Boys/Pitchfork Sausage, Cheese On-A-Stick and Fresh-Squeezed Lemonade, Giggles’ Campfire Grill, El Sol Mexican Foods, The Hangar, and Sweet Martha’s Cookie Jar.
 Offerings will be slightly different from at the first parade, with vendors giving a nod to fall with items like a brie and cranberry topping option on Turkey to Go sandwiches, Polish sausages and sauerkraut at Butcher Boys/Pitchfork Sausage, pumpkin spice funnel cakes and hot apple cider at the Hanger and deep-fried pumpkin and apple pies with cinnamon ice cream at Minneapple Pie, a new vendor for the fall parade.
