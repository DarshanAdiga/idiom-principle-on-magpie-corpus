But to what level does she endanger those around her? Grayson, Odette’s husband, and his sister, Greer, seek to retrieve her for different reasons, leaving chaos and destruction in their wake. After Odette learns the nature of her power, she must confront the magical twins in a battle she is woefully unprepared to fight.”

European markets opened significantly higher, following a fresh record high on US indices, as investors welcomed the prospect of a solid US stimulus package. The “risk-on” trading stance is back on most benchmarks after the $916bn Stimulus package proposal from US Secretary of Treasury Steven Mnuchin offset mounting fears due to rising Covid-19 numbers. This had an immediate effect on stock prices everywhere while European shares also benefited from another bullish leverage: Brexit negotiations. Investors were pleased to see the UK has agreed to make some concessions regarding its Internal Market Bill, highlighting the will of the UK Government to strike a trade deal with its most significant trade partner, the EU, which remains reassuring. However, we are not out of the woods yet as some parts of the US Covid-19 relief package are still under negotiation while investors are waiting for more dovish measures from the ECB tomorrow when more market volatility is widely expected.

And so this is Christmas.
 So sang John Lennon in 1971. The Vietnam War took 2,414 American lives that year, so the song was a prayer of harmony and peace with a scrim of irony. Nor did the irony end there. Lennon was shot to death nine years later, 40 years ago Tuesday.
 And if the events of 1971 seemed sharply at odds with the hope of the holiday, the same can surely be said of 2020. On the surface, things seem much the same as they ever were, the same crush of manufactured joy and consumer avarice Charlie Brown’s been complaining about for 55 years. On TV, the same photogenic families stand in the driveways of the same upscale homes, beckoning you to buy a luxury car to celebrate the night when, Christians believe, heaven touched Earth.
 But this Christmas is not the same. It is a pandemic Christmas where death is already setting new records. Nearly 2,900 lives were lost in a single day last week, roughly equivalent to a 9/11 every 24 hours. The CDC says COVID-19 may have claimed nearly 330,000 of us by Dec. 26. Health care workers are physically and emotionally spent; the system is cracking under the strain.
 And so this is Christmas.
 But what is Christmas when you can’t — or at least, shouldn’t — travel? To go over the river and through the woods to grandma’s house this year is to risk exposing her to a deadly virus. Yet any year that denies you the ability to go home, to gather in a place of memory with those you love, is a year that steals something irreplaceable. That’s why carols written during World War II brim with such palpable yearning.
 “I’ll be home for Christmas, if only in my dreams ...”
 “Next year, all our troubles will be out of sight ...”
 “I’m dreaming of a white Christmas, just like the ones I used to know ...”
 How those words must have felt to some man sweltering in the jungles of Guadalcanal. Small wonder the Christmas that came at war’s end — 75 years ago — was “the greatest celebration in American history” in the words of Matthew Litt, author of, “Christmas 1945.” It’s a book one is hard-pressed to read without smiling, tales of soldiers, sailors and Marines rushing on crowded roads and rails to get home for Christmas and people doing for one another with cheerful, thankful hearts.
 Americans seemed moved by something deeper than manufactured joy and consumer avarice that year. When sailors stepped off their train for a Christmas Day layover in Glenwood Springs, Colo., the 1,200 residents met them with turkey dinners and gift-wrapped presents from beneath their own trees. A British mother wrote the only American whose name and address she knew — New York Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia — pleading for something impossible to find in war- ravaged Europe: a doll for her daughter. It was booked on a Pan Am flight and reached London on Dec. 23.
 This year there is, again, a need for something deeper. Something like they found in North Little Rock, Ark., last month after a black family erected a black Santa Claus in their yard only to receive an anonymous note demanding removal of the “negro” elf. Iddy Kennedy said it made her wonder “if this was the right environment to raise our daughter.”
 Then her neighbors learned of the harassment. There are now black Santas up and down the street. People also sent money, over $1,000, which the family has redirected to the Arkansas branch of Ronald McDonald House Charities. Speaking to The Washington Post, Executive Director Janell Mason called it “humanity doing good things.” And so it is.
 And so, this is Christmas.

Outside of aesthetics, Zoom has an easy-to-navigate interface. As a meeting host or guest, you can switch from speaker view (big window focused on the active speaker) to gallery view (a grid of video rectangles from everyone on the call). You can also mute or unmute your camera, turn video on and off, record the meeting, share your screen, virtually raise your hand and use the chat function or emoji reactions to respond.
 As a meeting host, you can create smaller breakout rooms, and enable much- needed security settings like a waiting room (more on that below). Depending on which tier of the service you pay for, you can host up to 1,000 participants.
 One of the biggest benefits: You can use Zoom for free. Anyone can sign up for a free account and host up to 100 participants for up to 40-minute group meetings, or unlimited one-on-one meetings. If you're looking for more, you can upgrade to Pro ($150 a year for each license), Business ($200 a year per license) or Enterprise ($200 a year per license), all of which come with unlimited group meeting times and other features.
 The competition took notice of all of this. Soon after Zoom's rapid rise in the early days of the pandemic, Microsoft rolled out a change-your-background feature on its video chat service Teams. The company's consumer chat service Skype also got a new free video chat feature called Meet Now. Google began offering a free version of its enterprise video chat service Meet. Even Facebook got in on the action, releasing a new consumer video chat feature called Messenger Rooms, allowing for free video chats with up to 50 people. (If you're curious, we've broken down how Zoom competes with Microsoft Teams, Skype and Messenger Rooms.)

Zoom didn't confirm or deny the allegations in the settlement, but agreed to implement a new mandated information security program within 60 days. It also agreed to use more secure safeguards such as multifactor authentication and data deletion. It said it would document potential risks annually and ways to mitigate those risks, and implement a vulnerability management program. Independent security audits are required every other year.
 To be clear, these security issues are concerning. But you do have a lot of power to protect yourself and your Zoom meetings from harm. For example, you can set up a randomly generated meeting ID, turn on a waiting room feature to approve all parties joining your chat, and lock meetings once every approved member has joined.
 In November, the platform added a feature that lets a host pause a meeting to remove an uninvited participant and alert Zoom's security team, and one that lets meeting participants report intruders too. And a new At Risk Meeting Notifier tool scans public posts online and across social media for Zoom meeting links. If it finds publicly posted meeting information that suggests a meeting is at high risk of being disrupted, Zoom will notify account owners and admins via email.
 For most people, this combined with the new end-to-end encryption should be more than enough security. But those from enterprises holding more sensitive data may want to do a full audit to make sure the privacy is up to par with their needs.
 "It's an ongoing effort," Zoom chief product officer Oded Gal told CNET. "We're taking it very seriously."
 ##  Expanding to new services
 Security issues aside, Zoom is powering forward with new features and services that expand beyond traditional video meetings. In October, the company launched the beta version of OnZoom, a platform for posting and finding quarantine-friendly virtual events ranging from concerts to cooking and fitness classes. And new Zoom Apps, coming by the end of the year, will live within the platform and let you access tools like Dropbox, Slack and Asana directly from video chats, for easier workplace collaboration.
 By the end of 2020, you'll find Zoom not only on your desktop or mobile device, but your Amazon Echo Show devices, Google Nest smart displays and the Facebook Portal \-- positioning the app as more of an at-home service for connecting socially than just a workplace tool, or just giving people who are still working from home another option for connecting to colleagues.
 Coronavirus restrictions won't last forever. Someday, we'll be able to sit in close quarters with coworkers, family members and friends without fear of spreading a virus like this one. But it may be a while, and my guess is that Zoom is here to stay. It and other video chat platforms have enabled us to reconnect with people near and far when we didn't always do so in the past. And if we bring any new tradition forward with us into the unknowable future, we could do worse than to keep asking, "Are you free to Zoom?"

To win military leaders’ support for new nuclear policies, or at least their politically useful nonresistance, experts and civilian officials will need to offer the military better alternatives for deterring or defeating threats. The best such alternatives would be dialing down Russian and Chinese coercion of their neighbors, and negotiating verifiable reductions of Russian nuclear forces and limitations on China’s military buildup. The United States, of course, will have to provide reciprocal reassurance to Moscow and Beijing, which is easier said than done. The other, not mutually exclusive, need is to improve U.S. and allied non-nuclear capabilities to prevent Russia or China from taking small bits of disputed territory and then leaving Washington with the dreadful choice of capitulation or major conflict that could escalate — purposefully or inadvertently — to nuclear war. To allay concerns of arms racing, Washington should make clear to Moscow and Beijing that it prefers to negotiate confidence-building and arms control mechanisms with them if they want to.

Public inattention means that Republican leaders could have relatively free hands to pursue arms control and disarmament measures if they wanted to. Their supporters will not protest, and Democrats by and large will go along. Democratic leaders face a much tougher challenge. The more public their arms control-related initiatives, the more that nativist Republican forces will counter them with narratives of weakness, naivete, and indulgence of evil Iranian Ayatollahs, Chinese Communists, or Russian cheaters. Those narratives win in cable news and internet combat in swing states and districts. To counter them and buy the necessary Republican votes, Democrats are compelled to fund new or different military capabilities that signify strength and revenue to defense contractors and host states. This says more about the public and the political-psychology of enmity than it does about Democrats, but the reader imagines that the Obama of the Prague speech underestimated the challenge.

Another full life was celebrated in an empty church, and when the musician led the singing of, “How Great Thou Art,” you couldn’t hear the congregation. And they couldn’t hear me and the other 89 people watching the livestream, singing in our homes to mourn a life that ended too soon.


  It is hard to calculate the damage of the COVID-19 pandemic, but surely the emotional damage is one of the biggest harms.


  People are social animals, even people like me who think of ourselves as generally antisocial. We are starving for emotional connections, and we are all desperate to resume our old lives.


  Something like our old lives will come back for most of us if we are careful and patient. It is hard. But if grieving spouses, children and friends can do it, we can, too.


  We notice the loss the most at the funerals, weddings and graduations, the Christmases and Thanksgivings, the times that mark and celebrate life’s milestones. A livestream funeral is odd; a distanced, masked group of mourners is bizarre and somehow more painful.


  A less-noticed loss comes from loss of small, daily interactions.


  We ignore the CDC’s advice and go to bars for the same reason we want the schools to resume in-person classes or the church to hold in-person services. It’s not because we’re ignorant or evil; it’s because bars, churches and schools feed our deep need for those small, casual social interactions.

David P. Hyatt, 44, of 2950 Buckingham Road, was charged Tuesday afternoon by Greeneville police with possession of a Schedule III drug, possession of a Schedule IV drug and possession of drug paraphernalia. Hyatt was in the Quick Stop market at 1801 W. Main St. when an off-duty sheriff’s deputy saw Hyatt pull out a cigarette pack that contained pills. Police were called and searched a backpack Hyatt had with him. A case fell out of the backpack that contained a a glass pipe, a scale, a cut straw, a syringe and three different packaged pills, Officer Derek Casteel said in a report. Pills allegedly in Hyatt’s possession included Buprenorphine, Alprazolam and Tadalafil, and part of another pill that couldn’t be identified. Hyatt was held on bond pending a first scheduled appearance Wednesday in court.
 A Telford man was charged Tuesday by the Johnson City Police Department with two counts of violation of the sex offender registry. Dewayne Railey, 39, of Oriole Lane, is required to report quarterly. He allegedly failed to report in September and also moved from Johnson City to Telford without notifying proper authorities, a police report said. Railey was placed under arrest Tuesday and taken to the Washington County Detention Center, where he was held in lieu of a $2,000 bond pending arraignment Wednesday.
 A woman allegedly causing a disturbance Monday afternoon in a Greeneville neighborhood, prompting citizen complaints, was charged with public intoxication. Janel V. Powell, 33, of 1113 Tusculum Blvd., was held on bond pending a first scheduled appearance Wednesday in court. Greeneville police were called about 6:45 p.m. Monday to the 600 block of South McKee Street and saw Powell “yelling and aggressively knocking on the door of the residence,” a report said. Powell told police she lives in an apartment there, but a resident said she has not lived there for more than two months. Powell “was unable to offer a coherent answer for where she had been prior to arrival at the residence,” the report said. Powell was wearing capri pants and shoeless. Prior to police arrival, 911 Dispatch had received numerous calls about a woman matching Powell’s description causing disturbances in other locations throughout Greeneville, the report said. Powell “appeared to be under the influence of a narcotic to the point that she posed a danger to herself or others,” and was placed under arrest for public intoxication.
 Apparent vandalism damages were done to rubber roof membranes of businesses in the 600 block of Asheville Highway, Greeneville police said in a report.

A roofing company was called, and an inspection indicated “the rubber on the roof looked to have been cut,” Officer Derek Casteel said in a report. Repairs to the roof totaled $8,400. On Sunday, the property management company was called by Ingles Markets about a leaking roof. The roofing company was called in and the rubber on the roof was found to have been “cut in a semicircle with a box cutter and the box cutter was still on the roof,” the report said. H&R Block, another tenant, also reported a leaking roof. Repair estimates for the Ingles and H&R Block roofs were not available Tuesday to police. Greenwood Properties, of Bowling Green, Kentucky, is the owner of the building housing the businesses.

MADISON, Wis. (AP) — Two Republican lawmakers put up a Christmas tree in the Wisconsin Capitol rotunda despite being told they weren't allowed to do so — a show of defiance after Gov. Tony Evers opted not to display a holiday tree there this year because the building is closed to the public due to the coronavirus pandemic.


  The Department of Administration has traditionally placed a towering evergreen decorated with ornaments constructed by school children in the rotunda every year to celebrate the winter holidays. Evers, who controls the DOA, has refused to call the tree a Christmas tree, irking Republicans.


  This year, Evers decided to forego a tree since the Capitol is closed to the public due to the coronavirus pandemic. That apparently didn't sit well with Republican Reps. Paul Tittl and Shae Sortwell, who, like other lawmakers, are still working out of the building.


  Records show the two lawmakers applied for a permit on Dec. 1 to place what they described only as a "historical display" in the rotunda from Dec. 1 through Jan. 6. The application does not say the display is a Christmas or holiday tree.


  Dan Blackdeer, chief of the Capitol Police, an extension of the DOA, denied the request the next day. He wrote that the DOA can issue permits for events and exhibits in the building but under state law only the State Capitol and Executive Residence Board can approve decorative items.


  He said the board has prohibited the DOA from permitting any exhibits on the rotunda's ground floor since 1978. A permit request must be filed at least 72 hours in advance and the lawmakers' sought to display an exhibit the same day they submitted the application, Blackdeer added. What's more, the DOA is denying all permit requests for the interior of Capitol since the building is closed to the public, he wrote.


  DOA Assistant Deputy Secretary Olivia Hwang sent an email to Tittl and Sortwell that night explaining that since the DOA owns the building, it doesn't need a permit for the traditional holiday tree. She reiterated that the agency has denied all permit requests since the building is closed and said the lawmakers could still display a tree or other holiday decorations in their offices or any space in the building controlled by the Assembly.


  The lawmakers put up a tree in the rotunda anyway on Dec. 1 before they received a decision on the permit from DOA, Sortwell said. The seven-foot artificial decoration was still there on Monday morning, complete with signs that read, "The magic of Christmas is not in the presents but in his presence" and "This tree belongs to Representative Tittl and Representative Sortwell. Do not move without prior written approval from these Representatives."


  Sortwell said he and Tittl wanted to give people a symbol of hope. They believe they don't need a permit since the traditional tree has never required one, he said. He refused to accept Hwang's explanation that the traditional tree doesn't need a permit because the DOA owns the building.


  "The people of Wisconsin own the building, not the Department of Administration," Sortwell said. "The tree has never needed a permit until now. ... All (Evers) needs to do is let this stand as our choice."


  Reminded that people can't see their tree since the building is closed, Sortwell said that they can watch a video of him and Tittl setting it up in the rotunda. Evers could open the building anytime, he added.


  "When times are tough, it's even more critically important that we hold onto the traditions we can hold onto," he said.


  Tittl didn't immediately respond to messages. He said during the video that, "We really wanted to have a Christmas tree in the Capitol. The governor said no, but we decided we were going to put one up anyhow."


  DOA spokeswoman Molly Vidal didn't respond to an email asking if the agency planned to remove the tree. Hwang said the lawmakers have appealed the permit denial.


  The move by Tittl and Sortwell is another example of the defiance that Republicans have shown Evers since he defeated GOP Gov. Scott Walker in 2018. Among other things, they passed lame-duck legislation weakening Evers' powers and convinced the state Supreme Court to strike down his stay-at-home coronavirus order.


  Meanwhile on Monday, Capitol Police approved Republican Rep. Amy Loudenbeck's permit application to place an artificial Christmas tree on the rotunda's first floor from Thursday to Jan. 5.


  Sgt. Andrew Hyatt sent an email to Hwang explaining that Loudenbeck's application differed from Tittl and Sortwell's because she filed it on Friday, more than 72 hours in advance, the permit is for the first floor and is valid for less than 30 days.

“There would be no reason to raise any of these issues now,” Thompson said. “There is no longer a controversy around the issue of faithless elector statutes as a practice and it would just be a pyrrhic victory to get tossed off of the Electoral College for no good reason.”
 DFL Party Chair Ken Martin said most of the Minnesota electors are chosen at the congressional district level in the spring by local activists, with a couple picked by state convention delegates. He said the new pledge was intended to make sure people understood their role and to reinforce the law.
 “There will be on Dec. 14, 10 votes for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris regardless of whether or not someone votes for someone else,” Martin said. “There’s no way actually there can be a ‘faithless elector’ at this point. And there’s plenty of mechanisms to deal with that.”
 If they do go rogue, Martin said it won’t matter to the vote tally.
 “It’s just sort of a nothingburger. So they decide to vote for someone else, they get yanked right away by the secretary of state and the alternate comes in,” he said. “It doesn’t really matter. It might be a news story for you guys but for us the only thing that matters are the votes at the end of the day.”

Congressman Jason Smith (R-MO) has been elected to serve as the Republican Leader of the U.S. House of Representatives Budget Committee.
 Upon the selection, Smith made the following remarks:
 “Missourians know the importance of having a budget and sticking to it. Unfortunately, Speaker Pelosi does not. The fiscal challenges facing our country are great, we spent 5 times more last year paying interest on our country’s debt than we did to provide benefits to our veterans, that’s not right. Right now millions of Americans are facing tough financial choices in order to make ends meet. Unfortunately, Speaker Pelosi and her squad continue to run up the national debt and waste American tax dollars on a big government agenda of control the American voters rejected. As our debt grows, the people who will feel the pain are not the wealthy, but the working class. The United States needs a budget that will get back to our foundational beliefs, focused on helping working families and putting them first.”

Despite the challenges, the team feels good about the routine it’s planned.
 “We’ve focused on still having a mixture of music that incorporates the whole movie and storyline with it,” Heller said.
 As for jazz dance, Kutter said the Showstoppers plan to have a jazz team, but with the pause, they haven’t had the opportunity to start.
 “Jazz is a little harder to learn online, and I don’t even have my jazz team picked yet, so we’re trying to figure out our plan for that,” Kutter said. “That’s one of those things where we’re going to adjust on the fly as soon as we find out more information.”
 For now, the Showstoppers are focused on doing what they can digitally for the high kick team.
 During the first week of practices before the pause, the team was able to record its choreography work together. So even though they’re no longer meeting in person, they can review videos and pictures to see where each girl stands and what moves to work on. They also break out into smaller groups to review and practice.
 Still, much like distance learning, there are challenges when it comes to distance dancing.
 “When I’m counting for them, they’re not dancing together because they have that delayed reaction of hearing me count, and they’re all hearing me at different times,”Kutter said. “So we can’t necessarily dance to music, because they all hear that at different times. But we are at least able to watch them and be a support system for them.”
 And when it comes down to it, being a support system for each other is really what it’s all about.
 “I definitely look forward to (practice),” Muellerleile said, “because I think for most of us it’s the only social interaction we’re getting right now, so it’s still enjoyable.”

In a troubling time, Working also noted that though things were tough, the situation was not so bad as it was for the early settlers in McLeod County, especially those who struggled through the financial panic of the late 1850s. During the panic, money was nonexistent in Minnesota and most communities operated on a system of barter.
 To make matters worse, spring crops were at the mercy of Rocky Mountain grasshoppers that could devour a field. Coupled with a string of late frosts, those living on the frontier at the time faced the reality of starvation as well as poverty. Working cited a quote from an unnamed pioneer who, in December 1857, wrote, “Times are hard and there will be much suffering this winter if prospects do not become brighter toward spring. I do not know what many of the people here will do as they have no money and little chance to earn enough to provide for the families.”
 It’s odd how we, as humans, tend to look to the past for comfort in the present. Today, we look back at the Spanish Flu Pandemic, or the Great Depression, as if to say, “at least it isn’t that bad,” and for Win V. Working and those of his time, they looked back to the generations before them in order to say the same. Perhaps looking to the past for comfort is merely a part of human nature.
 To close, I’ll offer the words of our cited author: “It is a good thing for us to have a little hard luck once in a while, if only to cause us to more fully appreciate life’s values. The men and women of the early years knew more of life than we. They were in direct and constant contact with its realities. Their pleasures were few and simple, but were enhanced by the contrast to their workaday lives. We might all be happier if we could go back to the plain living and the modest objectives of the pioneer days. Still, with a proper appreciation of these facts, we may better enjoy our present circumstances.”

2020 has been a rather detestable year to say the least, so much that I don’t feel I need to go great lengths to describe the situation. If future generations read this and wonder what worldwide ailments I speak of, I instruct them to Google, or whatever means of searching reference they have in the future, and they will likely find out all they need to know. At any rate, there is one bright spot in 2020, aside from it being nearly over, and that is the fact that Christmas is near.
 In spite of forces that might militate against it, there’s a certain sense of Christmas spirit this year that I haven’t felt for a while, evident by the apparent uptick in Christmas lights that shine from front lawns this year. Oddly, or perhaps not so, it’s a similar situation today as it was in December 1931.
 It was a tough time for Americans. The nation was amid an economic privation so merciless that history acknowledges it as “The Great Depression.” There were those who prospered during the depression, yet most suffered in some way, shape or form. For some, it was just another day of destitution, for others, however, the Christmas season was a bright, shining star that glowed bright in the dark world around it.

This latter point highlights one of the strongest benefits of distributing Squadron Officer School campuses: a potential for cost savings. While there will be some initial start-up costs to facilitate a start to Squadron Officer School operations on these bases, the Air Force will likely save money in the long term. As it stands now, the Air Force flies students in from around the world, paying their lodging and travels costs — all for a five-week course, seven times a year. By co-locating Squadron Officer School on operational bases in more densely populated areas, more students can be commuters, saving the Air Force tens of thousands of dollars a year. There will also be lower permanent change of station costs, as instructors are staying in the same area for back-to-back assignments. Most importantly, the Air Force will realize substantial indirect savings, as more officers decide to stay in the Air Force. This savings can be especially poignant, given the long-term sunk cost of training a pilot ranges from $1.1 million for a C-17 pilot to $10.9 million for an F-22 pilot.

 “In the juniors, you just focus on fundamentals, strength and movement. I had the game style to compete with the best, but was relatively slow on my feet,” he says.
 At the last national championships in Delhi, the head coach of Bopanna’s academy, Sujith Sachidanand, guided Poonacha to the men’s title, and the centre – which currently has seven hard courts, with three clay courts in the works – does have competent coaches with the ability to execute Bopanna’s vision.
 Bopanna is quite positive about the talent of Indian kids and the abundance of knowledge in the country for training tennis players. The trick is to put everything together without looking at the whole exercise as a profitable business. Many do good business through tennis, but at the academy, Bopanna is far too committed to player development. There is a certain clarity and a guarantee that the whole exercise will not be reduced to a simple business.
 At the high-altitude centre, with players training on high bouncing balls, they work with a vision and purpose. Be assured, world-class tennis players can be made in India!

Wearing sis Khloe K’s Good American stiletto boots in bed (relatable), the 41-year-old is pictured “studying” her _He’s All That_ script. The film’s official Instagram reposted the pic onto its Story with “Introducing Jessica Miles Torres,” a brand new character. Casting Kourtney Kardashian as a Latina is a choice among a production full of choices, like closing a Los Angeles COVID-19 testing site to shoot there (until the mayor intervened). Full name Addison Rae Easterling stars as Padgett Sawyer, a gender-swapped version of Freddie Prinze Jr.’s character Zack Siler. _Cobra Kai_ star Tanner Buchanan plays Cameron Kweller. The original writer, R. Lee Fleming and original producers Jennifer Gibgot and Andrew Panay are all on board the remake, which is directed by Mark Waters ( _Mean Girls_ ).

Since March, the organisation’s chefs have been making more than double the amount of kosher meals for older people in the community. Delivered by dedicated volunteers, the meal service brings relief from social isolation and is a lifeline to those who rely on the charity.
 Many people, like Leslie Barnett, 95, haven’t left the house since March and are reliant on the meal service each day. Leslie has lived on his own since his late wife, Angela, sadly passed away. He says: “I’m not used to being stuck at home on my own. Especially not for this long. Usually I go to the Jewish Care community centre at least once every week to see my friends. But I’m no spring chicken and my health isn’t what it was. So, I have to shelter at home to keep myself safe.
 “Angela and I always loved to dance, and I’ve managed to keep up my dancing ever since. But, of course being stuck at home means I can’t do that. I found myself staring at the same four walls every day. I’ve never been much of a cook, though Angela used to let me do the vegetables sometimes if she was going to be late back from work. But that was years ago, and most of the time, all that is in my fridge are some empty boxes and a duster to clean it with.
