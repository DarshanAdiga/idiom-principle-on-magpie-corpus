But the number of teens attending is nowhere near where it once was.
 “Teens are used to routines, even though they do not notice it,” Lopez said. “They are used to school and going to the MFC in the evening. Being stuck at home has made them not go anywhere.”
 This year, MFC and other organizations throughout the area have shifted gears from usual programs in order to find ways to better support youth mentally and emotionally, as well as physically. Some organizations have made an effort to start virtual mentorship programs while others have resorted to just calling and checking in. They all are trying to do what they can to stay connected.
 “When we did have virtual (teen night), we had activities planned out, but it was more, ‘Let’s talk about how everyone was doing,’” Lopez said. “With the political stuff going on in the world, they really wanted to speak about it.”
 The weekly teen nights at the center are open to 13- to 18-year-olds.
 Lately, the nights have been geared more toward self-care, such as meditation. Another recent night focused on Japanese culture, and attendees could try sushi.
 “A lot of the teens that we serve are teens who need an escape,” Lopez said. “Not having that escape for them — a lot of them have mentioned their stress levels are high. A lot of them are depressed. It really is sad to hear that with 14- or 15-year-olds.”
 MFC Director Jacque Hunter said staff have tried everything to bring teens back, but ultimately, the program will need to be completely rebuilt.
 “There is no consistency, and there is no routine,” she said. “I am a parent of four, and I have three children at home. I can tell even at home it has taken a toll.”
 Every year, counselors from Dubuque Community School District team up with local businesses to find mentors interested in working with elementary school students by either spending half an hour with them or just stopping by the school to eat lunch with them.
 But with the strict visitation rules put in place this year, that mentor program is only a shell of what it once was.
 “What we are doing this year is really a fraction of what we have done in the past,” said Shirley Horstman, the district’s executive director of student services.
 Some mentors and mentees chose to meet virtually this year and play games together online, but for others, learning the new platform has been difficult.
 “Some students thrive on the virtual, and others want the person-to-person contact,” she said. “We are trying to emphasize the (classroom) instructions, so for students that were matched with a mentor, we tried to keep it going. It’s not something that we have actively recruited this year. It’s just hard with the time that we have.”
 New COVID-19 restrictions forced the Dubuque Community YMCA/YWCA to cut the number of children in its school-aged child care program by about half, and the program only has one site available compared to the usual nine.
 Megan Fischer, director of the program, said kids ages 5 to 12 come to the Y to receive help with homework, play games and partake in physical activities such as swimming.
 But with many students either learning remotely or doing the hybrid model, it is less convenient for families to take them this year. The changes in the school routine have made it more difficult for the kids to receive help with homework, share how they are feeling or see friends, Fischer said.
 “It has really limited our families’ abilities to get assistance or care, just because it is not right before or after school,” she said. “For the kids, it’s very stressful, especially when school went virtual because it increases their workload so much. You can tell they are stressed that they cannot see their friends.”
 When Mentor Dubuque made the decision to take away its monthly match- recruiting event, it also ended all face-to-face meetings between mentees and mentors. In June, the restrictions loosened, but without the ability to add new mentors, the program has suffered.
 “We have seen not so much of a drop-off, but much more of the fact that we can’t recruit and bring on new mentors because of the COVID challenges,” said Annabelle Steffen, a program coordinator with the organization. “We are about 14 matches down from where we were last year.”
 By early next year, the organization hopes to have a virtual chat possible, but until then, mentors have been calling mentees to check in and remind them they are not alone.
 “I think the current situation has opened up and exposed the weaknesses,” she said. “We try to do our best and we are surviving day to day.”

AFTER a year with more hardships than most, good Samaritans across the Southern Downs are bringing Christmas joys to families without.
 Clifton resident Sheridan Ruhle started her quest to spread Christmas spirit after being inspired by similar missions across Australia.   She is calling for donations of items that can be gifted to those in need, from hamper items, to vouchers and even household items.
 Mrs Ruhle said 2020 had left no one unscathed.
 “So many people are really struggling this year, it’s been a tough one,” she said.
 “In our region, it’s not as bad as the city, but a lot of people have lost their jobs or gone a long time without any income.
 “Drought is still affecting everyone, and it’s massive. It has been tough one, if we can help out we will.”
 Mrs Ruhle has already been overwhelmed by the support.
 “The response is really good actually, especially in the immediate local area, a lot of locals got behind it,” she said.
 “One lady offered to cook a meal for someone on Christmas Day.
 “We delivered a mattress yesterday and in exchange got a dozen of eggs and mango chutney. Everyone kind of benefits.”
 Mrs Ruhle’s hope was that it would mean presents around the tree for all and revive the spirit of Christmas.
 “You don’t want anyone to miss out,” she said.
 “As adults, you lose the spirit for Christmas a little bit and you want to bring it back to how you felt as a child. You would feel gutted if you couldn’t provide that experience for your kids.”
 To donate, contact Mrs Ruhle on 0437026691 or message her via this post.

Robinson then recalled his Nitro match where he teamed up with Flair against Randy Savage and Madusa. He understood that he was going to be the one to take Savage's elbow drop, but things went wrong and he suffered tragic injuries from the elbow drop.
 "Randy Savage, he took the time to work with me in the ring and to work on the match to make sure that what we gave to the fans was fun and entertaining, and it wasn't meant to be a comedy thing because it wasn't," Robinson noted. "I thought the match turned out actually pretty good. He was just fantastic.
 "The only problem I had with Savage was about a week later, after my match, which was in a sold-out RCA Dome in St. Louis, they were hanging from the rafters. A week later, Ric Flair and I, we teamed up to take on Madusa and Savage. They called it a mixed tag match. I think they were saying I was part of the other mixed, but of course, Savage and Madusa, they were going over.
 "They were going to be the winners and Savage was going to do the elbow on somebody. And Ric Flair looked at me and said, 'It ain't gonna be me.' I was volunteered to take the elbow drop from Savage, and unfortunately, he landed on me and he put me in the hospital for a couple weeks. He collapsed my lung [and] cracked some vertebrae in my back, and my wrestling career was over."
 Robinson acknowledged that his in-ring wrestling career was short. However, he noted that a career as a referee tends to be longer than an in-ring performer, and despite the original plan being him and Flair teaming up throughout the summer, he felt things worked out the way they were supposed to.
 "It was very, very short but it all worked out because I find that a referee's career tends to be a little bit longer than an in-ring performer, as a wrestler," Robinson pointed out. "I was supposed to tour with Ric all summer long. We were supposed to tag. Well if that would have happened, who knows what it would've done to my referee career. I'm of the mindset things worked out the way they were supposed to."
 Robinson talked about being a Flair fan ever since he was a kid, even to the point of having his mom bleaching his hair. He also told a story about buying Flair a Coke.
 "I always looked up to him. He was the reason that I had my first dye job," Robinson revealed. "This is natural now. Seventh grade, my mom, she was a hair stylist - a beautician they called them back then. And she bleached my hair out. And from then on, I wore warm-up jackets that I put rhinestones, and sequins, and feathers, and I wore those around the school so everyone knew my love for the Nature Boy.
 "Once, I finally got to meet him. First time I met him, I was in Rocky Mount, NC - Ric Flair against Wahoo McDaniel. I was staying with the cousin of mine. He took me to the show and I went down to see Ric. He was standing over by one of the dugouts and he gave me a dollar. And he says, 'Go buy me a soda.' So I went and got this guy a Coca-Cola, went back down, gave him his Coke, and gave him his change. He didn't give me a tip, Corey!"
 Robinson praised Flair for being one of the greatest in the business. He also praised Flair for his ability to tell stories and how every story Flair tells is "the greatest story ever."
 "Just to work with Ric was just phenomenal. I've always looked up to him," Robinson stated. "I think he's definitely one of the greatest workers in the ring ever. One of the greatest talkers, has so much charisma, so just to be able to hang out with him and to hear his stories-- his memory is so great. I've forgotten everything. He'll say, 'Yeah, this was on the 13th, 1982.' It's like, how do you remember that?
 "The buildings, I have so much trouble remembering anything like that. I love it because no matter what story he tells, he'll say this is the greatest story ever. 30 minutes later, oh, this is the greatest story ever. I just love it, but all of his stories are the greatest story ever."

County Supervisor Jack Willey said the cost to construct the new 30-bed jail will total $6.2 million. He explained that county officials settled on asking for $5.9 million in bonds in order to sway voters.
 “The majority of the people we talked to said they thought the last one would have passed if it was under $6 million, so we made sure we asked for less than that,” Willey said.
 The remaining $300,000 would come from the county’s capital improvements fund. While the fund currently holds about $150,000, Supervisor Mike Steines said it should reach $300,000 by the time construction on the jail begins if the March vote succeeds.
 “It’s the best action for us to do to bring the cost down,” he said. “It would be great if the bid came in low.”
 While Willey said he has some concerns about the smaller jail meeting future capacity needs for the county, the completed facility would possess the capability to be expanded to hold an additional 12 beds if needed.
 “Everybody said they didn’t want us to build a hotel to house out-of-county prisoners,” he said. “We don’t know what the future holds. Thirty beds might be too small, but that is what we ended up with.”
 While the road has been long, Steines said he believes the vote in March poses the best chance the county has ever had to secure the funds needed for a new jail.
 “We missed it last time by only 100 votes,” Steines said. “We have kicked the can down the road for three years. I think people know this needs to be done.”

I did enjoy the scenery a good deal, especially some of the interiors, which are filthy with little details, like books and pamphlets and newspapers--I wouldn't have accepted anything less, since the damn game devours 180GB of disk space. Outside, there are some stunning vistas, and an incredible number of distinct scenes and set pieces. Just the number of landscapes produced for this game is a hell of an accomplishment.
 With so much variety, there's some enjoyment to be had just from seeing how the devs approached each scenario. No scene is totally successful, and there are some real stinkers: infiltrating a Nazi base by walking around with a box of papers, a dreadful nautical stealth segment, an underwater bit where you have to wave your arms to swim (just awful), a scene where you shoot down planes that just kind of get stuck in the ocean when they crash (this whole scene is bizarrely janky). But some are stupid in a fun sort of way. When you climb into a tank, for instance, the cannon follows the center of your vision, and it feels as if you've _become_ the tank. It isn't more fun than any other on-rails tank combat level-- _look at Panzerschreck guys, shoot them with the machine gun_ --but after defeating a Tiger tank you're off to do something totally different.
 It's like wandering between lavish but disappointing interactive museum exhibits. You know turning the valves in the U-boat isn't going to be more fun than pretending to be a janitor in the Nazi facility (you have to bend down and pick up trash to blend in), but you still want to check it out.

After losing its top-two scorers from last season, the Lake Havasu boys basketball team will field a team full of young players with little varsity experience in a season that will be shortened by the pandemic.
 “This year we got some younger guys so it’s going to be a learning curve this year,” junior point guard Brenton Szymanski said.
 Szymanski is one of three starters back for the Knights. Gerard Bolden Jr. and Casey Gates are other two returning starters with the former averaging close to double-digit points last season. Bolden Jr. averaged 9.8 points per game as a sophomore, according to MaxPreps.
 Bolden Jr. brings the most varsity experience after Szymanski and Gates both got injured last year. The team will have a variety of guys promoted to varsity after they played on the junior varsity squad last season. It will be the second year playing at the varsity level for Bolden Jr., Szymanski and Gates.
 Havasu head coach Ted Darnell said there were some kids who opted out of playing due to covid-19.
 The program lost last year’s top scorers Bradley Rogers (16.9 PPG) and Jayden Azar (16.4) to graduation.
 With the season not expected to start until January, the extra practice time could be used as an advantage, as the newcomers try to get settled at the varsity level.
 “I think with the extra practice time, we’ll get more work in, more conditioning and hopefully getting the new guys to get their reps in,” Bolden Jr. said.
 Last season, the Knights went 9-16 overall and were 0-8 in the 4A West Valley Region. Havasu started its season at 9-3, but ended up with a losing record after finishing the 2019-20 campaign with 13 consecutive losses.
 The Knights were moved to 5A and realigned to the Desert West Region this season. Notable schools in the region include Millennium and La Joya Community, both of whom won over 20 games last year with the former finishing as the 5A runner up.
 Originally, Havasu was supposed to start the season on the road against Gild Ridge in December, but the Knights aren’t expected to play until Jan. 5 after the Arizona Interscholastic Association postponed winter sports in November. The Knights have been practicing since Nov. 9 and are allowed to continue to hold practices for the time being.
 Darnell said the expectations are always to make the playoffs, but in a season that brings uncertainty during a pandemic, he’s just looking forward to coaching and seeing the kids play.
 “We’re just excited to just get out there and have an opportunity to play,” Darnell said.

Bloomberg) -- Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin faced questions on Thursday from a congressional oversight panel over his department’s decision to extend a $700 million loan to a trucking company backed by private equity firm Apollo Global Management Inc.
 The Treasury Department approved a loan to YRC Worldwide Inc., a Kansas-based shipping company, drawing on funds from the March Cares Act that were intended to help bolster companies critical to national security. The watchdog has raised concerns that the loan could put taxpayer money at risk and that YRC, which ships supplies between military bases, isn’t critical to national security.
 Congress and outsiders “encouraged us to take losses” on the program, Mnuchin said Thursday at a Congressional Oversight Commission hearing about the national-security loans. “We are not saying this is a market loan. Had it been a market loan, Treasury would not have been involved.”
 “Fortunately, we’ve made a significant profit” on the YRC deal, Mnuchin said. “I am going to recommend that next year whoever is Treasury secretary seriously look at selling this loan and recovering what I think will be a profit to taxpayers, because this was a success.”
 Representative French Hill, an Arkansas Republican on the panel, said that taxpayer money is at risk because he didn’t believe that the collateral pool backing the loan was worth as much as Treasury estimates.
 Apollo Question
 “I think you’re vulnerable there,” Hill said.
 The Treasury doesn’t want to be in the business of making long term loans to YRC or any national-security companies, Mnuchin said.
 Bharat Ramamurti, a Democratic appointee on the panel, said that loan raised questions about who would get paid back first: the U.S. government or the creditor Apollo Global Management. He said a General Accountability Office report released Thursday suggested that YRC got special, fast-tracked treatment for its loan approval that other companies did not get.
 GAO Report
 The Treasury “accelerated evaluating YRC’s application due to the urgency of the business’s financial circumstances, including the possibility of YRC filing for bankruptcy if it did not receive aid,” the GAO report said. “Treasury did not fast-track any other applications from specific businesses based on financial need, though other businesses faced similar circumstances.”
 Ramamurti asked Mnuchin to turn over any correspondence that the Treasury had with the White House over the YRC loan. The Treasury chief said he’d consult with legal staff, but emphasized there was no communication specifically with Jared Kushner or Kushner’s staff. The family business of Kushner, Trump’s son- in-law, was reported in 2018 by the New York Times to have received credit from Apollo.
 The congressional panel has been questioning the YRC loan for months. In July, it said the company was at risk of bankruptcy because of a heavy pension burden and has been rated non-investment grade for more than a decade.
 The money for the $700 million YRC loan came from a pot of $17 billion for national security companies. YRC received the largest loan by far from that fund -- the 10 other companies that qualified for loans received $35.9 million combined. The more than $16 billion of the pot that remains should now be reallocated by Congress, Mnuchin said.
 He noted that the expectation had originally been that the Treasury might have had to help the likes of Boeing Co. or General Electric Co., but the rebound in the economy and markets proved better than anticipated and the money wasn’t needed.
