 MUNDRI, South Sudan, Nov 4 (Reuters) - After the worst rains in living memory inundated her fields, South Sudan farmer Alexandra Karama is, like hundreds of thousands of her compatriots, staring hunger in the face.
 Her smallholding is located outside the western town of Mundri, one of the worst affected areas where swathes of crops have failed.
 "My groundnuts have all been swept by the water... Nothing is left, no sorghum (either)," Karama, a grandmother, told Reuters in Mundri town, where she has been forced to seek shelter at a U.N. compound.
 Like much of east Africa, South Sudan has been affected by unusually prolonged torrential rains over the last year. The United Nations estimates flooding has displaced more than 600,000 people, equivalent to more than one in 20 of the population.
 Now, with the worst of the rains gone, aid agencies and the government of the young country, which seceded from the rest of Sudan in 2011, are rushing to distribute seeds for replanting to avert a famine.
 "We (oversaw) the distributions of seeds and crops in order that people could be able to cultivate back despite the fact that many of the crops have already been destroyed," said Humanitarian Affairs and Disaster Management Minister Peter Mayen Majongdit.
 In Mundri alone, about 22,000 people have been affected by the floods and are in urgent need of food, shelter and health care, said U.N. humanitarian coordinator Safari Djumapili.
 The U.N. was distributing some supplies, but roads to the area have been rendered impassable, complicating interventions, he said. (Writing by Elias Biryabarema; editing by George Obulutsa and John Stonestreet)

PARIS, Nov 4 (Reuters) - French Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin came under fire in the press and on social media for apparently breaking government lockdown rules that people can only go out to take exercise within a kilometre of their homes.
 French daily La Voix du Nord and several other media reported that Darmanin went for a jog with his bodyguards on Sunday along the Roubaix canal well over a kilometre away from his home in Tourcoing in northern France.
 People can be fined 135 euros for breaking the rule.
 "Double standards?" La Voix du Nord wrote.
 "Prohibitions are for paupers and miserable mortals, the Olympians above us are exempt," one Twitter user wrote. "The law does not apply to the marquis," another tweeted.
 Government spokesman Gabriel Attal said that if Darmanin had "adapted" the rule, it had been for security reasons.
 "The interior minister, like all ministers, of course respects the rules. But security services often ask to adapt those rules," he said.
 An interior ministry spokesperson declined to comment but referred to an interior ministry security service source quoted in La Voix du Nord, who said that jogging in the city centre would expose the minister to security risks and that the secluded canal area was safer.

Arizona. The president is at a much larger five-point deficit in Arizona, so you might be surprised to learn that it's still up for grabs. But there's uncertainty about the remaining vote. One thing we know: There are late mail ballots, received by the state over the last few days. These ballots usually tilt Democratic, but this year they might not. So many Democrats rushed their ballots in early that most of the remaining absentee ballots are from registered Republicans. It's possible these Republicans just went out and voted on Election Day. But it's also possible they've sent in their ballots, which haven't been counted yet. We'll get a better idea later Wednesday, when officials have said they expect to have finished counting ballots.

On the night that Cristiano Ronaldo began his 18th consecutive Champions League campaign, it was Alvaro Morata who did the bulk of the scoring for Juventus.
 Morata netted the first two goals in a 4-1 win at Ferencvaros, giving the Spanish forward four of Juventus’ six scores in its opening three matches in the competition.
 “I’ve got the motivation that every player needs,” said Morata, who rejoined Juventus in September on loan from Atletico Madrid. “I feel wanted and desired and I’ve got everything I need here. If this squad continues like this we can go far.”
 Ronaldo, who missed Juventus’ opening two Champions League games after contracting the coronavirus, set up Morata’s second.
 Substitite Paulo Dybala got Juventus’ third into an empty net after Ferencvaros goalkeeper Dşnes Dibusz failed to control a back-pass. Lasha Dvali then scored an own goal following another error by Dibusz.
 Franck Boli pulled one back for Ferencvaros in the 90th.
 “We were too complacent in the first half and slowed the tempo too much,” Juventus captain Giorgio Chiellini said. “We did better when pushing after the break and raised the tempo to create chances.
 “We shouldn’t kid ourselves, though. There was a big difference in the level of the teams,” he said.
 Juventus remained three points behind Group G leader Barcelona, which beat Dynamo Kyiv 2-1. Kyiv and Ferencvaros trail with one point each.
 Seven minutes in at Puskŕs Arşna, Morata used one touch to redirect a cross from Juan Cuadrado, who had run onto a through ball from Leonardo Bonucci.
 Celebrating his 100th game with Juventus in all competitions, Morata was just as efficient on the hour mark when he took a cross from Ronaldo and connected with a shot from the edge of the area.
 United States midfielder Weston McKennie used an dummy to let Ronaldo’s cross reach Morata.
 Morata also scored both goals when Juventus won its opener 2-0 at Kyiv.
 Only Ronaldo’s former Real Madrid teammate Iker Casillas has appeared in more consecutive Champions League campaigns — 20 between 1999-2000 and 2018-19.
 Ronaldo was denied by an expert tackle late in the second half after being set up unselfishly by Morata, then missed wide after the break.

WASHINGTON, D.C. — Votes are still being counted in many of 2020's election races, but results are in for some key seats in the U.S. House and Senate.
 The biggest news in the congressional ag world is that Republican challenger Michelle Fischbach, a former lieutenant governor who turned 55 on election day, ousted Democratic incumbent Collin Peterson, 76, in Minnesota. He is the long-serving chair of the House Agricultural Committee.
 Peterson's chairmanship, now up for grabs, has big sway on agricultural policies as Congress begins work on a new federal farm bill.
 "I think the biggest story here so far is Collin Peterson losing. But what winds up happening and what it means for ag will depend on who takes his seat on the committee," said Daren Bakst, senior research fellow in agricultural policy at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank.
 Peterson, who has represented his agricultural district for three decades, lost his re-election bid early Wednesday. The Associated Press reports Fischbach beat Peterson with 53.4% of the vote to his 39.9%.
 Peterson is known as a moderate Democrat, often siding with Republicans on key votes. He has earned a reputation as the "godfather of sugar" in the nation's top sugar beet-producing region. He has also gone to bat for pork and dairy farmers.
 Agricultural policy experts told the Capital Press that whoever fills Peterson's seat on the committee likely won't pose a threat to agriculture and won't dramatically shift the committee's positions.
 However, the new chair could mark a shift in legislative priorities because agriculture is so regionally driven and commodities vary by state, they say.
 With Peterson out, experts predict a three-way fight for the next agriculture chair between Reps. Marcia Fudge, David Scott and Jim Costa.
 The past few years, Fudge, from Ohio, has criticized the USDA for its nutrition policies and its decision to relocate two of its agencies to the Midwest.
 Scott, from Georgia, has fought for farm bill funding and land grant universities and co-authored a law to reform the federal dairy program.
 Costa's California district grows a lot of fruits, vegetables and tree nuts and is also a dairy region — all priority sectors for him.
 "I don't think we'll see a whole lot of change as far as the balance of parties on the ag committees, but different ag interests, like prioritizing certain crops or emphasizing the nutrition side, may be an issue," said Bakst, the agricultural research fellow.
 Policy experts say farmers should know more about who will take leadership of the House Ag Committee in the coming weeks.
 Experts say new committee assignments will likely be made four to six weeks after election results are certified.
 Whoever wins Peterson's chair won't have full control anyway, farm groups say. The new chair will be one piece in a great clockwork of moving parts. The final results from the House and Senate races as well as the presidential race will have the most sway on agricultural policies.
 And for now, according to The Associated Press, final tallies are still unknown and many congressional races remain tight.

MCBAIN — Doug McLain and Becky Voelker were comfortably ahead in the McBain Rural Agricultural Schools board of education race at press time but the other two candidates remained neck and neck.
 McLain and Voelker had vote tallies of 1,539 and 1,891, respectively, while the margin between Abrahamson and Warner was much more narrow — only two votes.
 With precincts in Missaukee, Wexford and Osceola (all part of the McBain Rural Agricultural Schools district) reporting, Abrahamson had 1,302 and Warner had 1,300.
