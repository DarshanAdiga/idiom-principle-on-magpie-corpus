Varela started Eintracht’s first two Bundesliga matches of that 16/17 campaign, but suffered a bad ankle injury in that second appearance. Torn ligaments would see him sidelined until February, while complications arising from his recovery meant he wasn’t consistently involved again until April.
 By that time his team had made an improbable run to the DFB-Pokal semi-finals; he played against Borussia Monchengladbach as Eintracht won on penalties and progressed to face Borussia Dortmund in the final for a major trophy, a European place and a spot in the club’s history.
 Instead, days before the final, Varela opted to defy team orders and get a tattoo on his arm. It became infected and inflamed, leaving manager Niko Kovac to suspend him and sporting director Fredi Bobic to go back on plans to extend the loan for a further season.

Britain's economy has been ravaged by the deadly novel coronavirus, which now threatens potentially the worst recession in several centuries, the Bank of England warned on Thursday.
 Policymaker Gertjan Vlieghe, who sits on the central bank's interest rate setting committee, issued the gloomy warning as survey data showed UK business activity shrivelled up this month on the back of COVID-19 lockdowns at home and abroad.
 "Based on the early indicators, and based on the experience in other countries that were hit (by the virus) somewhat earlier than the UK, it seems that we are experiencing an economic contraction that is faster and deeper than anything we have seen in the past century, or possibly several centuries," said economist Vlieghe.
 Britain's nationwide lockdown was imposed on March 23 in a bid to halt the spread of the pandemic, mirroring severe restrictions to daily life introduced elsewhere.
 \- Devastating picture -
 A new survey issued Thursday painted a devastating picture of the impact.
 The manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) for services and manufacturing plunged to just 12.9 in April after 36 in March, compilers IHS Markit and the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply said.
 The reading was far below the key 50 level which separates contraction and expansion, and represented the worst reading in the history of the survey.
 "Widespread business shutdowns at home and abroad in response to the COVID-19 pandemic unsurprisingly resulted in a rapid reduction in UK private sector output during April," Markit/CIPS said in a statement.
 "The latest composite PMI signalled by far the fastest decline in business activity since comparable figures were first compiled over two decades ago."
 \- 'Dazed and confused' -
 OANDA analyst Craig Erlam told AFP that the coronavirus represents a hammer blow to the economy, despite enormous stimulus measures from the Bank of England and Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Conservative government.
 "It's hit the economy like a blow to the back of the head; severe and unexpected, leaving the country dazed and confused," Erlam said.
 Britain's Office for Budget Responsibility fiscal watchdog has warned that coronavirus could shrink the economy by 13 percent in 2020.
 The BoE was at the forefront of economic firefighting last month, slashing interest rates to a record-low 0.1 percent and expanding its quantitative easing -- under which it buys UK government and corporate bonds -- to £645 billion (737 billion euros).
 Finance minister Rishi Sunak had unveiled a series of multi-billion-pound stimulus packages, backing up employee wages by up to 80 percent, giving tax holidays to businesses and boosting welfare payments.
 The Office for National Statistics declared Thursday that Sunak's vast stimulus would have a "significant impact" on UK public sector finances, which have already overshot their annual target.

A rollback, the statement added, “would violate the fundamental rights of those affected.”
 Bin Haydara, the Baha’i leader, was arrested in 2013 by the government of President Mansour Abed Rabbo Hadi. After the Iran-backed Houthis overran most of the north and Sanaa, forcing Hadi to flee, bin Haydara remained behind bars.
 Since 2015, the Houthis have been at war with a Saudi-led coalition backing Hadi’s internationally recognized government. A Houthi court sentenced bin Haydara to death in 2018. The decision to pardon him was announced on March 25.
 For years, human rights advocates have decried what they say is unlawful incarceration of the Baha’is and have demanded the minority be granted the right to practice its faith freely. The monotheistic Baha’i religion was founded in 1844 by a Persian nobleman, considered a prophet by followers.

HERMOSILLO, Sonora.- Alrededor de cuatro mil 300 millones de pesos ha sido el monto de la pérdida en el sector turístico durante este mes, prestadores de servicios estiman que pudiera recuperar algunas actividades hasta agosto.      Ante la contingencia sanitaria por el Covid-19 y el cierre de playas y lugares turísticos, durante abril se esperaba que fuera una época buena para el sector por la Semana Santa, pero las pérdidas fueron más de cuatro mil 300 millones de pesos.      El coordinador de la Comisión de Fomento a Turismo (Cofetur), Luis Núñez Noriega, resaltó que esperarán a recibir indicaciones para cuando se puedan abrir las actividades al turismo.   Para esto deberán contar con un plan de promoción turística en los principales destinos del Estado y que beneficie tanto a restauranteros, hoteleros, prestadores de servicios, touroperadores, entre otros.      “Tenemos que esperar que la autoridad sanitaria nos indique que se puedan abrir las actividades al turismo, no podemos adelantar nuestra actividad. Tendrán que hacerse campañas de promoción turística para atender las necesidades de requerimiento para los sectores de turismo”, resaltó.      De parte de los touroperadores se estima que el turismo local se pueda reanudar de forma paulatina a partir de agosto, por lo que desde el próximo mes empezarán con una campaña de promoción para cuando puedan reanudar.      Julio Rascón, presidente de la Asociación de Touroperadores y Guías turísticos de Sonora, resaltó que se espera que en agosto sean viajes locales a comunidades de la región y en grupos pequeños, además de pedir un certificado médico a los turistas.      Por el momento los touroperadores y prestadores de servicios se preparan con una campaña de reactivación, pues se esperaría que el turismo llegue a la normalidad hasta dentro de un año.      “Se estima que el turismo local se reanude a partir de agosto, el nacional a partir de noviembre o diciembre y el turismo internacional hasta dentro de un año”, comentó.

Former Australia fast bowler Peter Siddle's return to county champions Essex has been delayed until at least 2021 after the coronavirus put paid to the start of this year's English season, he announced Thursday.
 The 35-year-old took 34 wickets at an impressive average of 20.08 in eight matches last year as Essex won the County Championship First Division title.
 He had been all set for a return to the county's headquarters in Chelmsford, east of London.
 But with the pandemic bringing cricket to a standstill worldwide and suspending the start of the English season until at least May 28, with further delays looking likely, Siddle and Essex have agreed to hold his deal over until next year.
 "It's a shame I won't be returning to Chelmsford this year as I was really looking forward to the season with the Eagles, but there are plenty of things more important than cricket going on in the world at the moment," said Siddle.
 "In light of the current situation, it makes sense for me to come back over for the 2021 season when hopefully we're back to normal and playing cricket again," added Siddle, who took 221 wickets in 67 Tests and helped Australia retain the Ashes last year.
 Several counties have either postponed or completely cancelled contracts with overseas players as a result of the ongoing pandemic, with Australia batsman Peter Handscomb saying earlier Thursday that his deal to captain Middlesex was "on hold".
 Meanwhile doubts remain over whether Australian lockdown regulations that ban citizens from overseas travel will allow Sussex coach and former Australia fast bowler Jason Gillespie, currently in Adelaide, to take up his post with the south coast club should the English season get underway.

 "Les wouldn't work with someone he doesn't trust, and doesn't think is doing right for the game.
 "I think that speaks volumes for him and their relationship."
 The consortium hoping to buy Newcastle United is now waiting for the deal to be passed by the Premier League after Mike Ashley agreed to sell the club to The Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia, Amanda Staveley, and the aforementioned Reuben Brothers.
 It is understood that a director of football will be appointed should the deal go through, and Barton reckons Ferdinand would fit the bill.

Cheryl Kaczmarski of Gilbertsville has raised chickens off and on the past 15 years. At one point, she had over 50 chickens, enjoying being able to give some of the eggs away to family and friends. And, there's nothing like a grain-fed chicken served up on the dinner table.
 The 62-year-old grandmother who also sells real estate, downsized over the years. She gave the last of her brood away last fall.
 And, then the novel coronavirus pandemic hit.
 Kaczmarski said after not being able to buy eggs or a whole chicken in the grocery store, she decided to go back to raising her own. She recently picked up an order of baby chicks from Hardwick Farmers Co-operative Exchange.
 "I sort of got caught with my pants down. I said that was a pretty dumb time to give up your chickens," Kaczmarski said with a chuckle.
 To become more food sustainable during these unprecedented challenging times, Kaczmarski has also doubled her vegetable garden to 100 feet by 100 feet.
 "I have plants started in the house. We're ready to go. We're doing everything a little bit more this year because of the virus," she said.
 The 62-year-old grandmother, who lives on six acres with her husband, Taji, is not alone, hatcheries and farm suppliers say they are seeing a significant uptick in the number of chicks being sold to first-time backyard flock owners, as well as return customers who are buying more of the birds this year.
 Steve Gould, general manager of the Hardwick Farmers Co-operative Exchange, said more than 2,100 chicks were picked up curbside on April 16, the first of two "chick days" for the season. About 1,700 were picked up this time last year. Orders for the co-op's second chick day on May 21, seem to be even stronger.
 The perceived food insecurities due to hoarding and other issues brought on by the pandemic is definitely what's driving up the increased number of chick orders, Gould said.
 "This year we're seeing a good increase. It's been definitely more than what has been in the last couple of years," Gould said. "May actually could eclipse the April order the way it's going."
 He said owning a small number of chickens became a trend for some first-time chicken owners three or four years ago. But, many of the people that he is seeing ordering chicks are people who grew up in rural areas or on a small farm. "They produced their own food when they are younger and they're getting back into it," he said.
 The same is true for vegetable gardening. More people seem to be planting vegetable gardens this year.
 There aren't many hatcheries in the region. But, Adam Metcalf, owner of Sheeran Farms in Brimfield, has a flock of Chinese Silkie chickens, an exotic small fluffy bird known for being good egg producers and are popular as pets.
 He said he never intended to become a hatchery. He started with a flock of 15 Chinese Silkie chickens years ago to provide organic eggs for his children. The flock has grown to 150.
 "It's been insane this year. People are wanting to buy chicks like we've never seen before," Metcalf said. He normally hatched 30 chicks every three weeks. Then it went to 65. In March, it doubled to 65. He has since had to buy a second incubator and is now hatching 130 chicks every three weeks. He said he can tell by questions from callers, including how to build a coop, that the vast majority have never raised chickens before.
 Many places that sell chicks in this area buy them from large hatcheries in other parts of the country, including Iowa, home to the country's highest number of laying hens. The U.S. is also the second leading producer of eggs in the world, after China.
 Murray McMurray in Webster City, Iowa, is one of the oldest, having opened in 1917.
 Tom Watkins, vice-president and co-owner, said the company ships out about 2,500 orders of chicks all over the country each week from February through October. The average order is less than 25 and each bird costs about $4. The size of the flock is based on the demand. But, Watkins said nobody knew the demand caused by the pandemic was coming.
 The hatchery received more than 1,000 phone calls Monday, April 13, typically the busiest day of the season. That was nearly double the 600 phone calls the same time last year. Even more orders have been placed online, Watkins said.
 "We're extremely busy. We're taking an abnormal amount of phone calls," he said. "We wouldn't say it's all first-time people. We also saw an influx of customers who had not ordered in a while. And, people who have, but are now getting more birds than they usually would."
 Watkins said there is no need to panic because there is not a chicken or egg shortage. They're just not packaged for retail sale. They're packaged for wholesale or food service for restaurants and schools
 Arthur Detweiler, owner of Art's Hatchery in Reinholds Pennsylvania, another top-egg producing state, said after a significant increase in sales this season, they are basically sold out.
 "Part of the reason is people are quarantined in their homes and they are bored. And, some of these people are probably scared. They want their own food source," Detweiler said. "Primarily, its that people are at home. Children are out of school and looking for something to do." He pointed out that it takes 22-24 weeks for a chick to mature and begin laying eggs.
 That's why Becky and Dave Tuttle of Barre and their children got back into raising chickens in their back yard. The couple lost interest and gave it up five years ago, when their daughter, Julia, left for college and their son, Benjamin, was a senior in high school.
 Julia, who graduates from UMass Amherst in May, and Benjamin, a freshman at the Massachusetts Maritime Academy, are home now and looking for something to do. Julia ordered 20 Buff Orpington and Barred Rock chicks, two of the most mild-mannered and top backyard egg producers that are also cold-hardy.
 "We need something to work on through the quarantine. It's kind of like a fun past time to do while we're home," Mrs. Tuttle said.
 Dave, who rehabbed the old coop, said he's glad his daughter brought up the idea. But, he won't be surprised if he and his wife at some point have to take over the project.
 "I'll be honest with you, I really enjoyed spending time with the chickens we had before. They made cool noises that were kind of relaxing," he said. "Plus, chickens eat ticks and help clean the yard. They're all-around good pets to have. And, there's nothing better than walking out to the coop and coming in and cooking some fresh eggs. You can really taste the difference between farm- raised and store-bought eggs."

Gap Inc warned on Thursday it may not survive the next 12 months intact and would need to borrow more funds in the face of widespread coronavirus shutdowns that have crippled the business of clothing retailers globally.
 The apparel retailer also said it had suspended rent payments for shuttered stores, and was in talks with landlords to defer payments, change lease agreements, or in some cases terminate the leases and permanently close some stores.
 Gap said the suspended rents in North America would have amounted to about $115 million per month.
 Brick-and-mortar retail chains are facing an unprecedented sales downturn as the coronavirus shutdowns drag on, forcing them to cut costs and tap credit lines to stay afloat.
 Luxury retailer Neiman Marcus is preparing to seek bankruptcy protection as soon as this week, Reuters reported on Sunday, while other department store operators are battling to avoid the same fate.
 Like many in corporate America, Gap has already withdrawn its full-year targets, suspended dividend, furloughed employees and drawn down its existing credit lines.
 The retailer, which owns Banana Republic and Old Navy, said it expects to have $750-$850 million of cash and cash equivalents, inclusive of short-term investments, at the end of the fiscal quarter ending May 2.
 In order to have sufficient liquidity for the next 12 months, the company said it would need to tap the debt market, cut jobs, defer capital expenditures and cut back on orders from vendors.
 "There are no comparable recent events that provide guidance as to the effect the spread of COVID-19 as a global pandemic may have ... and the steps we may need to take to address those impacts, are highly uncertain," Gap said.

A COVID-19 diagnosis took Aaron Shumaker -- a 36-year-old with no underlying health conditions -- by surprise.
   
 Shumaker traveled to Vancouver for work in early March and began showing symptoms of the virus in his Bee Cave home on March 11, the same day he was notified of being exposed to it by someone in Canada who had tested positive for the disease.
   
 Shumaker said that according to Austin Public Health, he was one of the first Central Texas residents to come down with the disease. Now recovered, he is counted as the second Travis County convalescent blood plasma donor to help other COVID-19 patients improve.
   
 Before contracting the virus, Shumaker said he led a normal life, traveling for his sales job and enjoying the outdoors on the weekends with his wife and 19-year-old daughter.
   
 Once his symptoms began -- including fever, headache, fatigue and a sore throat that transitioned into a persistent cough -- Shumaker immediately quarantined into a spare bedroom in his home and called his primary care provider. Ten days later, he tested positive for COVID-19.
   
 "One of my biggest fears was that my wife or daughter would be exposed and get sick also, so I was very fortunate that they were there to support me and provide food at the door," he said.
   
 Although his fever lasted for only three days, Shumaker said his cough endured for roughly three weeks, after which he began getting his strength back. As soon as his cough went away, he said he started researching convalescent plasma donation options.
   
 "I felt like it was my opportunity to maybe help the cause just a little bit," Shumaker said.
   
 He reached out to We Are Blood -- an organization that serves as a blood bank to 10 Central Texas counties -- and waited 14 days after his symptoms disappeared before completing an online questionnaire about his illness. His physician also provided a statement confirming he tested positive for COVID-19 and the dates his symptoms began and ended.
   
 Fifteen minutes after he hit "send" on the documents, Shumaker said he received a call from a We Are Blood staffer. A few hours later, he was in a chair at the agency's North Lamar location donating plasma and, by morning, COVID-19 patients at Ascension Seton Medical Center down the street were being infused with Shumaker's blood.
   
 "There were multiple people within the organization who came up to me while I was there and thanked me," he said.
   
 During the next few days, We Are Blood staffers updated Shumaker on what happened to his plasma and when it reached coronavirus patients.
   
 "That was exceptionally rewarding to be kept in the loop and to know that while it's a small effort, it was already making a difference for someone out there in our community," he said.
   
 COVID-19 convalescent plasma donors must have a prior lab-tested diagnosis of COVID-19, be recovered and symptom free for at least 14 days, said Nick Canedo, vice president of community engagement at We Are Blood. If an individual doesn't have a prior lab-tested diagnosis for the disease, he said the facility will accept documentation of an antibody test approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
   
 "The physicians are prescribing the transfusion of that plasma for people dealing with life- threatening symptoms of COVID-19," Canedo said. "In each case, because there are standing orders from physicians requesting this convalescent plasma, it's being sent out the very next day for treatment of patients."
   
 He said the donations are an "incredibly critical" treatment option because there's no COVID-19 vaccine. Similar convalescent plasma treatments were used to combat prior viruses and diseases, such as SARs and Ebola, before pertinent vaccines were developed, he said.
   
 According to Canedo, the plasma donations are slowly ramping up, an uptick he attributes to an increase inindividuals who have recovered as well as the agency working more fervently with prospective donors to gather the needed documentation in coordination with Austin Public Health.
   
 A COVID-19 convalescent plasma donation takes about two hours, Canedo said, and prospective donors meeting the criteria can contact www.weareblood.org for more information.
   
 Five-and-a-half weeks after the onset of his symptoms, Shumaker said he still feels more tired than before he contracted the disease and is "definitely not 100%," although he is considered to be fully recovered.
   
 "The people who are coming in after they have fought and recovered from COVID-19 and are now choosing to help out fellow community members--they are heroes to us," Canedo said.

SPRINGFIELD - Top leaders of the Illinois House and Senate say there is still no timetable for calling lawmakers back into session, but they have launched a process for narrowing down the topics they'll need to address whenever they do return.
   
 In recent weeks, both the House and Senate have formed what they are calling "working groups" that are focusing primarily on how to resume state services and reboot the state's economy once the COVID-19 pandemic subsides.
   
 The House has organized 14 such working groups, focusing on policy areas such as access to health care, economic recovery, child welfare, food accessibility, education and mental health and addiction.
   
 In the Senate, there are 17 working groups focusing on many of the same topics as well as the state budget, executive orders, gaming, regulatory relief and unemployment insurance.
   
 Officials have been careful, though, to stress that the working groups are not legislative committees and that they are not authorized to draft legislation, hear testimony or take votes.
   
 "These are far more informal," Rep. Michael Zalewski, a Riverside Democrat and co-chair of the House economic recovery working group, said this week. "I think they're simply ways for us to congregate and hear each other out and compare notes and ideas about what we're going to face in the near future, when we do return to normal regular order."
   
 The difference between "working groups" and legislative committees is important because Article IV, Section 5 of the Illinois Constitution requires all meetings of the General Assembly, as well as legislative committees and commissions to be open to the public, unless two-thirds of the chamber votes to close them.
   
 Scott Szala, who teaches about the state Constitution at the University of Illinois College of Law, said the drafters probably never anticipated a situation like the one the General Assembly now faces, and there have been no Supreme Court cases since the Constitution was ratified in 1970 to clarify how far that provision extends.
   
 In fact, he said, the only case dealing with that constitutional provision came in 2001 when the Supreme Court rejected a lawsuit filed by the Illinois Press Association and several member newspapers against then-Gov. George Ryan over media access to meetings of legislative and executive ethics commissions. The court rejected that suit on the grounds that the governor was not a proper defendant in the case.
   
 Zalewski agreed that the drafters of the state Constitution probably didn't envision such a scenario.
   
 "I think that it's incumbent upon us to at least somewhat organize ourselves into policy silos to be ready for whatever's coming next," he said.
   
 Rep. Dan Brady, R-Bloomington, said he accepts the fact that the working groups have only a limited charge.
   
 "I would have to tell you that I think if we have to do any votes or anything substantive like that, we're going to have to be back to the Capitol, I think, in order to effectively make sure that what we're doing is seen by the electorate and that people have the opportunity to be part of it," he said.
   
 Senate Minority Leader Bill Brady, also a Bloomington Republican but no relation to Dan Brady, said the working groups are needed so lawmakers can focus on the tasks that will face them when they reconvene.
   
 "These are challenging and difficult times. (Senate) President (Don) Harmon and I talked about what we can do to work on making sure that the legislators were educated and we didn't lose the time that we have to do that," he said.
   
 Zalewski said one of the most pressing tasks - one that he said state government has little control over - will be getting the state's economy up and running again, which he said could take a very long time.
   
 "I think it's going to be slower than many people would desire," he said. "I think that we're going to need a lot of economic stimulus from the federal government because they have the ability to inject immediate capital into the economy. Our ability to inject capital is far less available. What we're able to do is promote specific policy proposals that, down the line, could produce economic activity."
   
 Republicans have recently called for a strategic reopening of sectors of the economy in the coming days, and Gov. JB Pritzker has hinted at changes to his stay-at-home order, which is scheduled to end April 30.
   
 Sen. Brady said in a phone call he would like to see the data Pritzker is relying upon so it could inform a regionalized approach to opening some businesses. He specifically pointed to hospitals that indicate they can reopen for certain procedures while still handling COVID-19 cases.
   
 He said data may indicate some areas are ready for openings sooner than others.
   
 "We need to plan for that," he said. "We need to tell the people of Illinois what the benchmarks are."
   
 A group of House Republicans on Wednesday called on the governor to allow hospitals to resume performing cancer screenings and other kinds of elective procedures, to allow many retail establishments to reopen provided they follow safety guidelines, and to reopen state parks.
   
 Rep. Ryan Spain, R-Peoria, said during a video news conference that the stay- at-home order that took effect March 21 has been successful and has probably saved many lives, but he said the people of Illinois also need to get back to work.
   
 "We've slowed the spread of COVID-19. We've bent the curve, allowing our health care workers to be more safe and better able to do their jobs," he said. "This has been important work. We've all made sacrifices together because this is going to be a long process as we go forward. But now we are looking at how we go forward and how we think about economic recovery in the state of Illinois."
   
 During his daily COVID-19 briefing in Chicago, however, Pritzker said the state still needs more capacity to test for the disease, to trace all of the people who have come into contact with infected patients, and build up an adequate supply of personal protective equipment, or PPE, before it can reopen the economy.
   
 "While we're working very hard on PPE and testing and spinning up a contact tracing effort that will be very large at the end, those are three things we have to work on and we're not there yet," he said.

EDENTON — The Edenton Steamers have announced a trio of Montreat College rising seniors set to join the ball club this upcoming summer including outfielders Chris Allende and Brody Rubenstein as well as right-handed pitcher Colin Kriminger.
 Chris Allende comes into this summer looking to build off of the momentum he established in the short 2020 spring season at the plate into Edenton.
 The 5’11 left-handed centerfielder was a standout member for the Cavaliers at the plate this past spring, achieving a batting average of .329 and a .539 slugging percentage. In 76 total plate appearances in 2020, Allende hit four doubles, three triples, two home runs while collecting 11 RBIs. Allende shined on the defensive end as well posting a fielding percentage of .949 in 39 total chances making 37 put-outs. Prior to his junior season at Montreat, Allende spent his first three collegiate seasons as a member of the St. Thomas University Bobcats and redshirting in 2017. In 2019, Allende was dependable on both sides of the ball for the Bobcats earning a .242 average at the plate with two home runs and 12 RBIs, as well as a fielding percentage of .971. Allende is a native of Homestead, Florida where he attended South Dade High School. Allende is currently pursuing a major in business at Montreat College.
 “Chris Allende is top notch outfielder with top end speed,” said Steamers Head Coach Marshall McDonald. “He can also run into a ball and drive it out of the yard. He will be fun to watch this summer!”
 Fellow Cavalier outfielder and rising senior, Brody Rubenstein, also looks to ride his hot hand at the plate into Edenton this summer. In 72 at-bats in 2020, Rubenstein boasted a .306 batting average collecting two double and three triples along the way along with 11 RBIs. Rubenstein also brings quick feet to the base paths for the Steamers. In 24 games in 2020 Rubenstein stole 10 bases in 12 attempts. On the defensive end, the 5’7 outfielder was just as strong earning a .929 fielding percentage in 42 total chances. Rubenstein also totaled three assists from the outfield during the 2020 campaign. Prior to his junior season with Montreat College, Rubenstein spent his first two collegiate seasons with the Lake-Sumter State College Lake Hawks. In two seasons with the squad Rubenstein was nothing short of an elite offensive talent, earning a career batting average of .377 in 313 plate-appearances, due in large part to his jaw-dropping 2018-2019 campaign during which Rubenstein amassed a .406 batting average. Rubenstein stole a total of 25 bases as well during his career with the Lake Hawks. Rubenstein was equally as impressive in the field for Lake-Sumter, posting a career fielding percentage of .979 along with 15 assists from the outfield. Rubenstein is a left-handed hitter but right-handed fielder who hails from Bushnell, Florida and attended South Sumter High School. Rubenstein is currently pursuing a degree in Exercise Science from Montreat College.
 “Brody Rubenstein is a very toolsy player who understands the game like no other,” Coach McDonald explained. “Watching him Rome the outfield in Edenton will be fun!”
 The last of the Cavaliers joining this summer’s Steamers squad is right-handed pitcher and rising senior Colin Kriminger. The 6’5 right-hander saw the mound 10 times during spring of 2020 and earned himself a 3.12 ERA over 26.0 innings of work and attained an overall record of 4-2. In his 10 games this past season, Kriminger help opposing batters to a .235 batting average allowing 24 hits in 102 total at-bats and striking out 28 opponents along the way. Kriminger spent the 2018-2019 season as a member of the Volunteer State Community College Pioneers.
 As a Pioneer, Kriminger made 17 appearances on the mound including one start. In 2018-2019 Kriminger earned an ERA of 3.66 and struck out 29 opposing hitters. Kriminger is originally from Ashland, Tennessee and is currently pursuing a degree in communications at Montreat.
 “Colin Kriminger is a big time arm with a plus breaking ball,” said McDonald. “Whether it’s starting or closing he is a max effort guy who competes like a bulldog!”

US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said a fundamental reform of the World Health Organization is needed following its handling of the coronavirus pandemic and that the United States, the WHO's biggest donor, may never restore funding to the UN body.
 "I think we need to take a real hard look at the WHO and what we do coming out of this," Pompeo told Fox News late on Wednesday. "We reformed this back in 2007, so this isn't the first time we've had to deal with the shortcomings of this organization that sits inside the United Nations. We need a fix. We need a structural fix with the WHO."
 President Donald Trump suspended US funding of the WHO last week, accusing it of being "China-centric and promoting China's "disinformation" about the outbreak. WHO officials have denied this and China insists it has been transparent and open.
 The United States has been the biggest overall donor to the WHO, contributing over $400 million in 2019, roughly 15% of its budget. Senior US officials last week told Reuters Washington could redirect these funds to other aid groups.
 Pompeo, asked if he was not ruling out a change in leadership of the WHO, replied: "Even more than that, it may be the case that the United States can never return to underwriting, having US taxpayer dollars go to the WHO."
 But the possibility of the US ceasing its funding definitively to the global body is contingent upon Trump succeeding in his bid for re-election in the November presidential vote, against the presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden.
 Fellow Democrats blasted Trump's decision, saying he was trying to divert blame from his administration over its handling of the outbreak of the novel coronavirus in the United States. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called the move to suspend WHO funding "dangerous."
 On Wednesday, Pompeo said the United States "strongly believed" Beijing had failed to report the outbreak in a timely manner, in breach of World Health Organization rules, and had failed to report human-to-human transmission of the virus" for a month until it was in every province inside of China."
 Pompeo said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom did not use his ability "to go public" when a member state failed to follow the rules.
 He said the WHO had an obligation to ensure safety standards were observed in virology labs in Wuhan, the epicenter of China's initial coronavirus outbreak, and its director-general had "enormous authority with respect to nations that do not comply.
 The acting head of the US Agency for International Development (USAID) said on Wednesday the United States would assess if the WHO was being run properly and look for alternative partners outside the body.
 The outbreak of the new coronavirus began late last year in China and has become a global pandemic. According to a Reuters tally, the disease has killed more than 180,000 people worldwide, including nearly 48,000 in the United States, making it the worst-hit country by official statistics.

Having grown up in Central California, Raymond Cloyd spent much of his time outdoors, examining the landscape -- and its bugs.
   
 Years later, with a Ph.D. in entomology and a bachelor's degree in horticulture, Cloyd spends his days researching, writing and teaching about insects in horticulture at Kansas State University. Most of his research takes place in greenhouses.
   
 Four years ago, Cloyd wrote Greenhouse Pest Management, which is published by CRC Press, Taylor & Francis Group. With slightly less than 200 pages and more than 150 color photographs and illustrations, this book is chock full of information. Greenhouse Pest Management teaches producers how to identify and manage horticultural greenhouse pests.
   
 "There's a lot of nuts and bolts and fundamental information about the best ways to deal with these pests and grow a quality crop," Cloyd said. "Thrips, aphids, white flies and spider mites are always a big problem.
   
 The first part of the book contains information on a variety of insects, including aphids, pillbugs, mites and thrips. The next section goes into detail regarding controlling these pests in the greenhouse. Physical, biological and chemical controls are introduced.
   
 Along with explaining how each type of control method works, Cloyd examines application techniques, timing resistance and multiple pest complexes. This practical reference is a resource for greenhouse producers, extension agents, crop consultants and advisers.
   
 "It's mostly hands-on fundamentals," Cloyd said. "Most of the greenhouse pests are common throughout the world."

Research shows that most adolescents need about nine hours of sleep a night. But unlike younger or older people, they usually get their best sleep between 11 p.m. and 8 a.m. So if teens get up at 5 or 6 a.m., they miss out on a lot of top-quality z’s.
 What’s more, not getting enough sleep puts students at risk of developing serious health problems. These include eating disorders, heart problems and anxiety. Academic success is affected, too. It’s hard to learn when you’re nodding off at your desk!
 But not everyone agrees that starting the school day later is a smart way to go. Opponents argue there’s no way to be sure students will get more sleep. After all, the law can’t make teens go to bed. Although studies suggest students do get more sleep when schools start later, more research is needed. And schools that start later will finish later. That will leave students with less time for things like sports, jobs, chores, homework and — last but not least — fun.
 Maybe the biggest roadblock for school districts looking into later start times? Buses. If all schools start near the same time, a district has to pay for more buses and drivers. That’s one reason so many high schools start very early. Flipping the schedules so elementary schools start first has drawbacks, too. Younger kids need more total hours of sleep. And early elementary dismissal times could be hard on working parents. Another option would be shifting all school schedules later. But that could create a whole new set of problems. Recess in the dark? California schools will have to work through these and other challenges in the future. Educators and government officials in other places will watch to see how the experiment goes. In fact, several school districts outside California have already adopted start times that meet the state’s new rules. In Seattle Public Schools, high schools start no earlier than 8:45 a.m. And an Ohio lawmaker introduced a bill to push back school start times there.
