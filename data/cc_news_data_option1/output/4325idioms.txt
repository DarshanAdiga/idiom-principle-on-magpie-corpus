Araton was blue collar, too, from the projects of Staten Island, landing at the elite Times only after stints at the Staten Island Advance, New York Post and Daily News. The son of a city postal worker, he harboured a lifelong sympathy for the underdog, save for a brief moment when he crossed a picket line at the News, one of many richly reported details in the book.
 “A wave of nausea engulfed me,” he wrote about seeing his byline on the newsstand. “I… walked across the street and vomited into a trash basket (then) went back on strike, grateful, at least, that my father hadn’t lived to see his son become a scab.”
 As they got older, and Araton suffered setbacks in his health and career, Musler was always the voice of reason. When the Knicks lost in heartbreaking fashion to the Houston Rockets in Game 7 of the 1994 NBA finals, he was surprised to see that she wasn’t upset.
 But as far as she was concerned, the Knicks had “shown up,” and that was all any reasonable fan could expect. It was just one of many wise lessons she taught him, now preserved for posterity in this wonderful book.

ST. CLAIRSVILLE, Ohio (AP) — Robert Murray, the board chairman of the largest privately owned U.S. coal operator, who long fought federal regulations to reduce black lung disease, died at his home in Ohio less than a week after announcing his retirement, a lawyer said.Michael Shaheen, an attorney who had recently represented Murray, 80, told The Intelligencer/Wheeling News-Register that he died Sunday morning in St. Clairsville.No official cause of death was given. Public reports recently stated Murray had applied for black lung benefits with the U.S. Department of Labor. The application said Murray was heavily dependent on oxygen.Murray had announced his retirement Oct. 19 from American Consolidated Natural Resource Holdings Inc., which is based in St. Clairsville. The company has active mines in Alabama, Kentucky, Ohio, West Virginia and Utah. Murray was the founder, president and CEO of the company’s predecessor, Murray Energy.Murray Energy was launched in 1988. The company recently emerged from federal bankruptcy protection, with its Chapter 11 plan becoming effective last month.“Bob fought through his medical challenges with the same energy, drive, guts, and faith in God as he approached everything in life,” Gov. Mike DeWine, a Republican, said in a statement. Murray was a friend for three decades, DeWine said.Murray had fought federal mine safety regulations for years, with his company suing unsuccessfully in 2014 over regulations to cut the amount of coal dust in mines to reduce the incidence of black lung disease.Shaheen said a private memorial service for Murray was scheduled for Tuesday.“Saddened to learn of the passing of Bob Murray,” tweeted U.S. Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, a West Virginia Republican. “He was a staunch ally for coal miners, a good friend, and a one of a kind person.”Copyright 2020 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

With more than a third of the expected ballots in the election already cast, it may become increasingly challenging for Trump and Biden to reshape the contours of the race. Biden is leading Trump in most national polls and has an advantage, though narrower, in many key battlegrounds.
 Biden is also sitting on more campaign cash than Trump and is putting it to use, blanketing airwaves with a nearly 2-to-1 advantage over the final two weeks. The incessant campaign ads from Biden feature a mix of his aspirational message with stinging critiques of Trump’s handling of the pandemic.
 It’s part of what Josh Schwerin, the senior strategist for Democratic super PAC Priorities USA, says has helped Biden gain an advantage.
 “Those dual messages — continuing to draw a contrast with Trump, but also offering that positive aspirational message, giving people a reason to vote for Biden and not just against Trump — continues to be the best way forward. And we’re seeing it work,” he said.
 Indeed, Biden has seen his favourability ratings steadily rise over the course of the campaign, despite a barrage of attacks from Republicans, while Trump remains underwater in such polls. Democrats have been heartened, too, by their lead in the record numbers of early votes that have been cast across a number of battleground states — though they caution that Republicans are more likely to turn out on Election Day and certain to make up ground.
 Still, multiple Democrats described the “2016 PTSD” that’s keeping them up at night a week out from Election Day. In 2016, Hillary Clinton also enjoyed a lead in national and some state polls, and Democrats say their complacency then doomed their candidate. Now, with the pandemic and record numbers of mail and absentee ballots injecting a greater level of uncertainty into the election, Democrats are reluctant to let their guard down.
 Biden’s campaign will focus in the final week on turning out what they’ve dubbed the “Biden coalition” — Black and Latino voters, as well as suburban, college-educated whites, women and older voters disaffected by Trump.
 “What we see consistently is there aren’t a whole lot of undecided voters left, and at this stage of the race it’s really about turnout. It's about educating voters to make sure they know how to vote, and it’s about making sure that that they turn out,” Bedingfield said.
 Biden’s campaign has emphasized the need for Democrats to stay engaged even as the polls seem to favour their candidate. In a recent memo, Biden campaign manager Jen O’Malley Dillon said that “in a number of critical states we are functionally tied,” and warned supporters that “every indication we have shows that this thing is going to come down to the wire.”
 Bedingfield says that’s a message the campaign will continue to push through Nov. 3.
 “One thing that we have been very vocal about is that we do believe the race is tighter than a lot of the public polling would suggest,” she said. “We are constantly working to ensure that that people understand that there is an urgency here, and that we can’t get complacent.”

 Interesting open forum in Saturday’s Star from Charles Uphaus. In it he decries Donald Trump’s apparent mishandling of the COVID epidemic and cites as evidence the lower death rate in our neighbor to the north, Canada. At first read it would seem he’s on to something until one realizes he’s asking us to compare apples to oranges. The USA and Canada are, indeed, quite similar in land mass or area, but population is another thing. Canada’s population is around 38 million people, while we stand at near 330 million. That’s eight point five times more people. Yes, 8.5 times more people. Canada’s two largest cities and their total surrounding metropolitan areas, Toronto and Montreal, together have less people than New York City alone. Canada’s population density is 3.4 people per kilometer as opposed to the USA’s density ranking of 32.5 people per kilometer. Canada is so sparsely populated that among developed nations only Greenland is ranked lower in population density. Mr. Uphaus’ comparison simply doesn’t hold water. His undying hatred for our President clearly colors his argument.
 This worldwide pandemic, spread by the Chinese, will run its course. We will survive, but our large cities will remain impacted, until vaccine availability, simply due to their dense population clusters. Look at the states least affected currently by COVID — Vermont, Maine, New Hampshire and Wyoming. What do they share in common? Low population density, quite similar to Canada. Yes, Mr. Uphaus, Canada does a lower rate of COVID than us, but to blame our President is wrong. Biden couldn’t defeat the swine flu, a much simpler virus, why assume he’s up to the larger task at hand. Follow the science, sir, follow the science. Blame population density, not the President.

State prison officials estimate that more than 14,000 inmates in Virginia could see their release dates moved up under&nbsp;legislation&nbsp;awaiting Gov. Ralph Northam’s signature.The bill, backed by General Assembly Democrats and unanimously opposed by GOP lawmakers, would let inmates cut their sentences by a third as long as they weren’t convicted of certain violent offenses, follow prison rules and participate in counseling and education programs.Supporters framed the legislation as an important reform that will encourage inmates to better themselves behind bars, though the measure’s sponsors expressed disappointment the original proposal was significantly narrowed as it made its way through the General Assembly in order to win support from more conservative members of the Democratic caucus.“It’s a step in the right direction,” said Sen. Jennifer Boysko, D-Fairfax, who carried the Senate’s version of the legislation. “I had hoped that it would be a little more generous in giving people the opportunity for a second chance but some of my colleagues in the House were not as comfortable with some of the Senate proposals.”The final bill lawmakers sent to Northam to set a flat rate of 15 days off for every 30 days served, which would reduce a 10-year sentence to a little over six and a half years. Under current law, inmates can earn a maximum of 4.5 days off for every 30 days served — a credit that will still be available to inmates excluded from the new program.It also includes a delayed enactment date of January 2022 to give the Department of Corrections time to reprogram its computer system.As initially proposed by Boysko and Del. Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, the bill would have excluded inmates convicted of a handful of serious violent offenses including first- and second-degree murder, kidnapping, robbery and rape.That list was expanded considerably during the legislative process to include most violent criminal acts. It also excludes people convicted of a second felony offense of animal fighting, acts of violence by a mob, burglary, possession of child pornography, cross burning and others. (See the&nbsp;bill text&nbsp;for a full list of exclusions.)The restrictions narrowed the number of prisoners who would currently qualify for the credits from 32,000 to 14,693, of which DOC says 1,380 would be eligible for immediate release because the bill requires the credits to be applied retroactively, according to&nbsp;impact statements&nbsp;prepared by the state.CONTINUE READING ON VIRGINIAMERCURY.COM &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The Virginia Mercury is a new, nonpartisan, nonprofit news organization covering Virginia government and policy.Submit a news tip.

The phrase 'Once in a Blue Moon' is aptly suited to the month of October this year, which will witness the rare occurrence of a second full moon, called the 'Blue Moon', on Saturday.The usual monthly lunar phenomenon is that every month has one full moon and a new moon. However, there are unusual occasions when the same month gets two full moons. October 1 saw a full moon and the next full moon falls on October 31, said Arvind Paranjpaye, director of Nehru Planetarium, Mumbai."When there are two full moons in a calendar month, the second full moon is called the Blue Moon," he said. There is a bit of mathematics involved in this. "Duration of a lunar month is 29.531 days or 29 days, 12 hours, 44 minutes and 38 seconds. Therefore, to have two full moons in a month, the first full moon should take place on 1st or 2nd of the month," Paranjpaye explained. This extra time accumulates over the months. After about 30 months there will be one extra full moon in the year, Paranjpaye said.He added that it is also not possible to have a full moon in February as it has 28 days, and 29 days during a leap year. N Rathnashree, the director of Nehru Planetarium, Delhi said the term Blue Moon is a calendrical term. "It is not too common to have a Blue Moon in a month of 30 days," she said.The last Blue Moon in a month with 30 days was on June 30, 2007 and the next one will be on September 30, 2050, Paranjpaye said.There were two Blue Moons in 2018. The first one was on January 31 and the second Blue Moon followed on March 31. "This was because the preceding month February had only 28 days," Paranjpaye said.The next Blue Moon will be on August 31, 2023, he added.T V Venkateswaran, scientist with Vigyan Prasar, the communication wing of the Department of Science and Technology, and an astronomy enthusiast, said this phenomenon is largely restricted to the Gregorian calendar which is being used worldwide."You will not see the phenomenon of two full moons in a month in Islamic or Tibetan calendars or the ones that are being followed in large parts of India as they are based on lunar movements," Venkateswaran said. The phrase 'Once in a Blue Moon', denoting something which does not happen very often, came from this phenomenon, Venkateswaran added.

They turned the truth on its head trying to make people sympathise with perverse criminals facing trial for their heinous crimes. They claimed their crime was fighting against some billionaire Prince and refined international Lawyer, Prince Ned who is grabbing their land. And the simple question is, how can people that are not from Ugboko be fighting for land in the community; because these hoodlums are not from Idumuje-Ugboko and have never lived there. So, what business do they have with the land? Then the second question is, if this land was acquired illegitimately, how is it that Idumuje-Ugboko as a community, has 40% equity in the university being erected on that land. Does it make any sense ? Is it logical ? It is therefore clear that the land grabbing story does not hold water and will never be tenable no matter how much Prince Nonso's agents push this detestable narrative on the media.

The small businesses that remain open sit among a handful of shuttered storefronts, like Howard Eakle's 41-year-old Carpet Outlet, which he closed to retire early at 64 when business dried up with the pandemic. Eakle says he now helps out sometimes at a hardware story to earn some pocket money.
 "I've lived here all my life and I've never seen anything like this," said Debbie Boyce, 60, as she waited outside her car to pick up dinner at Betty Noll's Restaurant. "I think it's only going to get worse."
 Some here sniff at other townspeople for not wearing masks more often. A few people with bare faces can be seen sitting on benches outside mom-and-pop shops.
 "I don't think the people are wearing masks like they should. They just aren't taking it seriously enough," said Eddie Sponaugle, 79, as he left a pharmacy wearing a face covering promoting President Donald Trump. He said he started to quarantine in March with his wife, only leaving their home to attend drive- in church services and buy essential goods.
 Sponaugle, who cast a mail-in ballot for Trump, said he has heard the criticism that the president himself has often not taken virus precautions seriously.
 "I noticed that. I guess you could say that's his privilege, if he wants to go without a mask," he said.
 The virus is now on the minds of many in West Union, even though it is not a major highway stop or urban center.
 "It's hitting everywhere. Doesn't matter if it's a small town or a big town," said Stanley Warner, 69, walking up a hill to his apartment after a grocery run.
 Holding up his red-and-black bandanna decorated with skulls, Warner said he doesn't wear it unless instructed, such as when a bank teller politely told him to mask up. He said he pulled up his bandanna and deadpanned, "Do I look like a bank robber?"
 After casting his ballot to reelect Justice, David King walked out of the polling station irritated about the governor's coronavirus restrictions. He said it was unfair his county couldn't have high school football games when others have more cases.
 Under Justice's rules, counties are judged by the number of positive cases per 100,000 residents. Doddridge hit the red category when it saw that number go over 25 last week, before going back into the orange category Oct. 19.
 "I like Jim Justice, except for his coloring book," King said, a swipe at the shifting categories. "It's totally blown out of proportion. We're so secluded."
 But that's not the prevailing sentiment in a county that recorded its first death on Sept. 23.
 The state ratcheted up free testing as the outbreak grew nationwide. Justice has urged people without symptoms to get tested, aiming to lower the county's positive rate to allow it to reopen schools and resume sports events.
 After parents implored, he made an exception to allow Doddridge County High School's cross- country team to compete in a regional meet Thursday. The football team, which is undefeated in its first five games, was idled for two weeks.
 "We're No. 1 in everything, and here we are," Eakle said last week, when the red category was still in effect. "We can't play now."
 Most in town speculate that the uptick in cases was driven by outsiders, although officials say only county residents are included in the local virus count.
 "It's not our favorite thing," said James Musgrave, 61, referring to the pandemic as he took a break from mowing his front lawn. "It's just one of those things you deal with and learn from and go on."

A trip to Saudi Arabia and a tilt at Gold Cup glory at Royal Ascot are among the potential targets for Princess Zoe next season after her winning run came to an end in France on Sunday.
 The Tony Mullins-trained mare has enjoyed a meteoric rise since being bought from Germany this year, progressing from a mark of 64 when second on her Irish debut at Navan in June to claim top-level honours in the Prix du Cadran on Arc weekend earlier this month.
 The five-year-old was bidding for a sixth successive win on her return to Paris for the Prix Royal-Oak – and while she came up a little short, she was far from disgraced in finishing fourth behind the Mark Johnston-trained Subjectivist.
 Mullins said: “She pulled out fine this morning and is in transit as we speak. The people looking after her said she looked a bit tired, which I can believe.
 “The way she ran tells me that we’re going to have some action again next year. You might have been worried what she did in the Cadran was a flash in the pan, but she showed me yesterday that she’s a serious trier and we’ll be at the top table again next summer.

However, no such issues were forthcoming and the 16,034 in attendance watched the Jambos take the trophy back to Gorgie after a 3-1 win, the Hibees forced to wait another six years before lifting the Cup again.
 The two sides were drawn together 17 times in Scottish Cup clashes after that, but it took 110 years for such a tie to take place at Hampden.
 In 2006, over 40,000 fans travelled to Glasgow to watch Hearts ease beyond their historic rivals with a 4-0 win courtesy of a Paul Hartley hat-trick on the way to lifting the trophy and prolonging the green and white half of Edinburgh's wait to see their side claim Scottish Cup glory.
 That would arrive ten years later and Hibs could bask in eliminating their rivals in dramatic fashion along the way, though only after one of the most painful afternoon's in the club's history in May 2012.
 The first final meeting between the two in the 116 years since events at Logie Green ended in humiliation for Hibs as Hearts recorded a 5-1 win to ensure maroon and white ribbons were on the cup again.

Suicide bomber Salman Abedi was smiling as he walked to his death and murdered 22 innocent bystanders by detonating his home-made backpack bomb, a public inquiry heard.
 Abedi, 22, was also on his mobile phone as he made his “final walk” after waiting for crowds to emerge at the end of an Ariana Grande gig at Manchester Arena
 Showsec security guard at the Arena on the night, Mohammed Agha, told the inquiry in Manchester: “He was on a phone, a mobile phone, he was smiling.”
 Seconds later Abedi detonated his device, packed with 3,000 nuts and bolts, shredding everything in its path.
 He had been hiding at the back of the City Room, the foyer to the Arena, before heading for the entrance doors of the venue as people emerged at the end of the gig at 10.30pm on May 22 2017.
 Mr Agha told the inquiry he had seen Abedi, dressed in black and carrying a big, bulky rucksack, three times earlier that night but did not think him suspicious until minutes before the bombing when he agreed it “crossed his mind” Abedi might be a suicide bomber.

It's much harder to keep an emotional distance when we're living a story, seeing it unfold in real time as a resident.

I've met people who sit in darkened houses because they have run out of money to pay their electricity bills. I know people who have committed suicide. I know people who have lost everything they've worked for, like my cousin Manolis in Crete, who built his home improvement and metalworking business from scratch and went bankrupt during the crisis. He and his wife and two children lost their house and now live with his sister. He works as a day laborer.
