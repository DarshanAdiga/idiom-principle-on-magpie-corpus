"Q. Would you have a threesome?"
 Delighted, Stacey squealed: "No thank you. I struggle to find the energy for a twosome, a threesome seems so much hard work."
 Stacey and Joe Swash have a one-year-old son together and are also raising Stacey's two older sons and Joe's older son in their blended family.
 And throughout the Instagram session, Stacey also revealed that she would love to get married to the father of her youngest son, Rex.
 She joked she was a "desperate loser" for wanting the 38-year-old to pop the question.

The deal has Simplot receiving 719 acres (290 hectares) adjacent to its existing gypsum storage area and phosphate facility, called the Simplot Pocatello Don Plant in Pocatello. The heavily polluted site was listed as part of a Superfund site in 1990 because of past phosphate processing operations. Phosphate is mined in giant open pits in the region and then taken to plants to be processed.
 In exchange, the bureau received 667 acres (270 hectares) of Simplot's private land in the Blackrock and Caddy Canyon area about 9 miles (14 kilometers) southeast of Pocatello. It's considered a prime recreation area and also key habitat for wildlife.
 The lawsuit notes that Idaho's Congressional delegation in 2018, at the request of Simplot, proposed legislation to circumvent environmental studies and mandate approval of the land exchange. However, the legislation didn't advance out of a committee.
 Under President Donald Trump, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has slashed support for some programs and regulatory protections benefiting disadvantaged communities. His budgets have proposed killing or cutting funds to enforce regulations promoting environmental justice — fair treatment of racial minorities and low-income residents who live near polluting industries and are disproportionately exposed to contamination — although Congress has continued most of the spending.
 Phosphate mining is a major business in southeastern Idaho, where phosphate ore is turned into fertilizer needed by farmers to grow food. Simplot started mining in the area about 80 years ago.
 Simplot is a privately-held multinational agricultural company engaged in a wide array of activities that include seed production, farming, ranching, frozen-food processing and gene editing.
 Simplot spokesman Josh Jordan, in an email to The Associated Press on Wednesday, didn't address specifics in the tribes' lawsuit but said the company has invested millions of dollars at its plant in Pocatello to improve the environment. He also said the plant is a major community employer, with just under 400 workers.
 “This facility provides nutrients needed to grow the crops that help maintain food security in North America,” Jordan said.

But that sort of ivory-tower reasoning fails to take seriously the risks and expenses of lawyering up, yet again, on a moment’s notice. And it gives short shrift to what the courts have long recognized as the “irreparable harm” caused by “the loss of First Amendment freedoms, for even minimal periods of time.” It would be wrong, Justice Gorsuch wrote in his concurrence, to “discount the burden on the faithful who have lived for months under New York’s unconstitutional regime unable to attend religious services.”

Already, we’re seeing a shift in how real estate owners and operators directly engage with end users, an increased understanding and use of data and analytics, and increased adoption of digital operations to power performance. Sensor data, robotic process automation, blockchain, analytics and cognitive, alternate data sets, cloud, data science, machine learning and artificial intelligence will drive innovation in the world of real estate and have the potential to significantly alter what it looks like ten years from now. Much uncertainty remains as we approach the end of 2020, but together we’ll explore digital strategies for all of these topics and more to help weather the storm and innovate for a brighter future. Check back next month for my thoughts on which digital trends I think will (or should) be most popular heading into 2021.

"Isn't it amazing," Ashley Lerblance said of the $15,000 donation to The Wig Closet. "They've always been generous and this donation is over the top."
 "It will buy a lot of wigs, hats and scarves," Lerblance said.
 Lerblance said she planned to meet with the MRHC Foundation to determine how to use the donation.
 MRHC Executive Director Chris Plunkett said it's not been absolutely determined, but a possibility includes changing the TLC WIG Closet's location.
 "It's not totally decided, but the end goal is to move it to create better access and expand to meet more needs," Plunkett said.
 Lerblance addressed the generosity of the Spirit employees.
 "The people at Spirit have always been so supportive and generous," she said, not only to The Wig Closet but to other charitable organizations in the community as well. She said The Wig Closet and others will miss their support once the McAlester plant closes.
 "I'm so appreciative they want to get behind their community that way," Lerblance said.
 Derichsweiler spoke of the workers at Spirit and noted that it comes as they are going through changes because of plans by the company to close the McAlester plant.
 "They're going through changes with the company and they still want to help the community," Derichsweiler said.
 "That's kindness in its purest form."

While Rosemary is her mother's obvious choice, Tony is less willing to simply give his son the land. He's concerned about this direction in life and confirmed bachelor status and would sooner gift it to his American nephew Adam (Jon Hamm), who puddle jumps from New York to Ireland as though he's taking a trip to Boston. There's also a land dispute at the crossroads of the two properties that means that the Reilleys have to get out of their car and unlock a gate every time they go anywhere. For two families who don't seem to know or care how many acres they own, it's unclear why ownership of the crossroads would be so important. Like too many things in the film, it seems that it's only there for the sake of quirk.

Rosemary, we're told, has always been in love with Anthony. They've been awkwardly circling one another's lives since they were 10 years old and she beat up another girl who teased him. But he has other things on his mind than marriage, although what exactly those things are is anyone's guess. These beautiful famers aren't keen to reveal much to each other, themselves or the audience. Maybe the cows know. Maybe they think there's time to wait. But that time is starting to run out - both have lost a parent and both her mother Aiofe (a delightful Dearbhla Molloy, reprising her Broadway role) and his father Tony (Walken) are also nearing the end and thinking about passing on their farms.
