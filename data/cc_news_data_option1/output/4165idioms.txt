Harvest is in the air around here and we couldn't have asked for better October weather so far.
   
 It feels good to get behind the controls of the combine yet again for another season. Skies have been blue, the dust is flying and my coffee is at arm's reach. I must admit combining is much more pleasant when cash soybean prices top $10. It makes those not-so-great yielding areas of a field tolerable.
   
 One never gets too tired of operating a single piece of equipment on our farm as we are always rotating between the auger cart, combine and truck. I like to consider myself a jack of all trades but the others I work with may disagree on that one.
   
 The kids have been able to spend quite a bit of time in the cab during the past couple of weeks. They did their homework out in the field one afternoon and rode along for the fun of it the other times. Rebecca often brings the kids out to see me and that's the highlight of the week.
   
 Our two older ones are starting to become combine and auger cart operators in training. Kenadee and Kasen can both keep a straight line when traveling through the field but little Kaislee needs some practice. I guess that's alright since she is only 1 year old. She can move the levers and reach for the turn signal well.
   
 The annual family fall birthday season is also upon us. Rebecca's birthday was back on Sept. 29, Kenadee turned six on Oct. 1, my birthday was last Thursday, Kaislee celebrates the big 2 on Oct. 29 and Kasen turns 10 on Nov. 8. Where does the time go?
   
 I realize during harvest we have to move fast to try and get all of the crops in, but sometimes you have to just stop and appreciate the small things. That's why we take off each evening of our birthdays to celebrate with cake and dinner. The fieldwork can wait a few hours -- it will be there the next day.
   
 Hopefully all of the farmers out there continue working safely to bring in the 2020 crops. It would be great if the awesome fall weather could continue for a few more weeks as we all finish out the season. It was almost a year ago when we had all of that unexpected snow around Halloween.

The British government is sticking to its strategy of tiered, regional restrictions to combat Covid-19 amid mounting political and scientific pressure for stronger nationwide measures to prevent the coronavirus pandemic from spiraling out of control.
 Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab on Friday reiterated the government's belief that a regional approach where the toughest restrictions are imposed only in the areas where infection rates are highest is the best way to slow the spread of the virus and protect the economy.
 "I think the right thing, both on public health grounds but also supporting the economy, supporting jobs, livelihoods, supporting our society and the most vulnerable in it, is to avoid a second national lockdown," Raab told Sky News.
 The government has been under fire since Prime Minister Boris Johnson unveiled his three-tier strategy on Monday amid revelations that scientific advisers had recommended a short nationwide lockdown to slow rapidly rising infection rates. Leaders of northern cities have refused to accept the tightest restrictions unless the government provides more support to cushion the impact on business and individuals.
 Opposition politicians accuse ministers of doing too little, too late.
 Jeremy Farrar, an infectious disease specialist who sits on the government's scientific advisory panel, said Friday that restrictions imposed under the three-tier strategy aren't tough enough to bring the virus under control, and that squabbling over where and when to impose the measures risks confusing the public.
 Calling the situation the "worst of all worlds" Farrar said the UK needs to quickly implement tighter restrictions nationwide to slow the spread of the virus and limit broader damage to society.
 "I think we've got to come together as a country," Farrar told the BBC. "The fragmentation and, frankly, making this either a north-south or a party political issue, that's a very, very dangerous route to go on."
 London and seven other areas will move into the second-highest risk tier on Saturday, leading to increased restrictions on more than 11 million people. So far, only the northwestern city of Liverpool has been placed into the top risk tier, which requires the closure of pubs and bars, and bans social gatherings between people from different households.
 Raab said negotiations are continuing with officials in Manchester, Lancashire about moving those areas into the top tier as well.
 "We will keep talking and we'll keep working," Raab said. "Obviously, in the last resort the government has the powers to proceed in any event, but we would much rather work with the local leaders if at all possible."

Until we embrace the sanctity of life across the full spectrum of life, our claim to be pro-life is simply a sham, manipulated by unscrupulous politicians who have no problem caging children, selling arms to vaporize families in foreign lands, and condemning to slow deaths the poor, the homeless and the hard-working who have fallen behind a society of and for the rich.


  But, for a moment, let’s focus only on the unborn. If it is our sincere desire to reduce abortions, is the conservative approach of restricting access to or criminalizing abortion, while also rolling back access to health care, the way to go? Let’s lay aside the question of that approach being capricious, misogynistic and cruel, and simply consider: Is it effective?


  Abortion rates in the United States have been steadily falling since their peak in 1990, and that downward trend started long before it was de rigueur for Bible Belt states to pass increasingly strict anti-abortion measures. Abortion rates in the U.S. are now less than half what they were in 1990, and a smaller fraction of what they were in 1973, when Roe was decided. That’s a win.


  But, was that due to tighter legislation? The Guttmacher Institute, a pro- choice research group often cited by both sides of this debate, found that almost 400 state laws restricting abortion access were enacted between 2011 and 2017 — but 57% of the nationwide decline in abortions was in just 18 states that passed no new restrictions during that period.


  Looking beyond our borders, Guttmacher found abortion rates are actually higher in countries that restrict abortion access than in those that do not. And, in countries that restrict abortion, the abortion rate has been steadily climbing in the last 30 years, while it has been declining in the United States. If it is our true desire to reduce abortions, why would we reverse course, and join the ranks of countries that have seen a steady increase of abortions over three decades?

During a discussion after that request, several board members expressed
 concerns, including the cost of the product, quality control and the potential for abuse.
 But after Shott’s presentation, which included emphasizing the proven health benefits of the treatment, board members agreed to reconsider.
 Board President Dr. Randy Maxwell pointed out that the board now has three new members since the March action was taken as well as when the decision not to reconsider was made in September.
 “We will definitely take it under consideration,” he said. “We will talk about it and revisit it.”
 Shott told the board when the bill first came up during the 2017 legislative session, the Senate sent it to the House “unannounced,” with no communication about it between the two houses.
 Shott used the analogy of a Halloween trick when someone places a bag full of dog poop on your porch, sets the bag on fire, knocks on the door and runs away.
 “You have a flaming bag of excrement to deal with,” he said, explaining that the Senate version was too broad, had no real details or limitations in what form the drug could be used, allowing it to be smoked or put in food.
 “The bill would have been highly deficient, but the votes were there to pass it,” he said.
 Not only that, in an unusual move, the bill was allowed to bypass tweaking in committees and was heading to a first reading in the full House the same week it was sent over from the Senate.
 “Our leadership, including the Speaker (of the House) … were caught off guard,” he said. “We were unprepared to deal with that because it rarely happens.”
 Shott, who is retiring this year, was head of the Judiciary Committee and he along with some colleagues asked for the first reading to be delayed until the following week so it could be reviewed and changed to make it more palatable.
 “They allowed us the weekend to work on it,” he said, and it ended up being a “much less objectionable bill” with a lot of sanitization, including guidance and restrictions.
 In a close vote, the bill passed 52-49, but Shott said some additional amendments also passed, by 72-28.
 “It’s not a perfect bill,” he said. “But we looked at all the other states that have it and incorporated the best provisions and the most accountability to the bill.”
 Shott said the bill ended up being a “really good product” and there are people he knows who could benefit from it, including a testimonial on the House floor related to cancer treatment and how it helped.
 The testimonial had a “great impact” on what happened in the House, he said.

ADDIS ABABA, Oct 15 (Reuters) - The bodies of 10 migrants washed up on the coast of Djibouti on the Horn of Africa, the U.N. migration agency said on Thursday.
 The incident occurred in the town of Obock, where there have been regular departures of boats packed with migrants, mainly from Ethiopia, trying to reach Yemen, or trying to make their way back to their home country.
 Thousands of Saudi-bound Ethiopian migrant workers cross Yemen each month. But restrictions aimed at curbing the rapid spread of COVID-19 in war-ravaged Yemen have made the journey even more perilous, forcing many to turn back.
 Earlier this month eight migrants died and 12 went missing at sea after being forced off a boat by smugglers off the Arabian Sea coast of Djibouti.
 To date over 14,000 migrants from the Horn of Africa stuck in Yemen are trying to make their way back to their home country. In the last three weeks alone, 2,000 arrived in Djibouti, according to the IOM.

So, if drinking to thirst worked well in the previous study, then why not just recommend it across the board for all runners? Personally, I’m hesitant to say that drinking to thirst works best in every situation because as exercise duration gets longer, small mismatches between sweat rates and drinking rates can add up to a hefty total. If you’re not sure what I mean, it can be helpful to consider an example. Say a 150-pound runner who drinks based on his thirst ingests 0.5 liter per hour and sweats 1 liter per hour during a 5-hour trail marathon. Ultimately, this mismatch in drinking and sweating may not add up to much 2 hours into the race (i.e., a couple of pounds), but by race’s end, his net loss would be about 5.5 pounds of fluid, which has the potential to impact his performance.

  MONTERREY, Mexico, Oct 15 (Reuters) - After losing her job in Honduras, Gabriela Alvarado has spent the last six weeks crisscrossing towards the U.S. border, part of a small but growing movement of Central Americans heading north after the coronavirus ravaged the already poor region.


  Alvarado and her husband, Jose, decided their only option was to leave their two children with relatives and try to reach the United States, after a fruitless hunt for work at home.


  "I went searching but there's nothing, everything is shut down," the 24-year- old former factory worker said on Tuesday from the northern Mexican border state of Sonora. "There's no employment."


  Earlier this year, U.S.-bound migration plummeted as Central American and Caribbean countries imposed strict restrictions on movement in response to the growing coronavirus pandemic, and the United States implemented a new program of rapidly expelling people caught crossing the border without authorization.


  The historic lockdowns threw the region's well-trodden migration routes into such chaos that some 'coyotes' - human smugglers - reversed course and began trafficking stranded Central Americans south to their home countries.


  Now, only weeks before the U.S. presidential election, the region's complex migration machinery is reactivating, smugglers, experts and migrants say, as the collapse of Central America's economies pushes families deeper into poverty, creating what could become a lightning rod political issue for the next U.S. administration.


  U.S. Border Patrol conducted nearly 55,000 expulsions or apprehensions of migrants at the southwest border in September, according to new data from U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), a 238% increase from April.


  Around two thirds were Mexican nationals, a DHS spokesman told Reuters, while Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador were the next three largest countries of origin.


  Early data for October shows the upward trend continuing, one U.S. source with knowledge of the numbers said.


  The data points to a rebound in traffic, although the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) said more than a third of the people expelled under the new U.S. program had been caught more than once.


  CBP acting Commissioner Mark Morgan on Wednesday said worsening economic conditions in the Western Hemisphere due to COVID-19 was expected to keep pushing migration higher.


  'OPENING BACK UP'


  Back in February, a human trafficker known as Chicote, who oversees a network of coyotes, took his last trip to the U.S. border, nervously eyeing migrants who coughed or sneezed while packed into the crowded safe houses the network uses to move people while evading authorities.


  By March, as the coronavirus swept across the region, members of the Gulf Cartel in northeastern Mexico told him to suspend operations. Chicote said he works with the drug traffickers to help migrants cross the Mexican border state of Tamaulipas into Texas.


  Then, in July, a Gulf Cartel operative looking for ways to boost the gang's income asked Chicote to restart.


  At first, still concerned about the pandemic, Chicote declined. But now, after a seven-month hiatus, he says he's back in business, with a twist. He now insists both smugglers and migrants use masks and plenty of anti-bacterial gel.


  "Everything is opening back up," he said.


  "People don't have money and they have debt – and the easiest way for them to make money is to get to the United States," Chicote said, explaining that his clients' family members in the United States foot the trip's $12,000-a-head price tag.


  Chicote asked not to be identified by his real name for fear of retribution.


  'THE SITUATION GROWS WORSE'


  In Honduras, the central bank expects the economy to contract between 7% and 8% this year due to pandemic-related restrictions, marking the worst financial collapse in the country's history.


  "People migrate because of extreme poverty and violence," said Ismael Zepeda, a researcher at the Tegucigalpa-based think tank Foro Social de la Deuda Externa de Honduras (FOSDEH).


  "With the economic contraction, poverty is becoming more profound."


  The controls on movement across the region, shrinking resources available to many potential migrants, and lingering fears of the pandemic still raging in Mexico and the United States have so far kept a lid on migration.


  But in a sign that pressure is building, thousands of adults, children, and elderly people joined a hastily organized and largely unsuccessful caravan that departed from Honduras two weeks ago, many grabbing their bags and leaving just days after learning on social media of the caravan's planned departure.


  "Every day the situation grows worse here," said 21-year-old Enoc de Jesus Ramirez, who said he joined the caravan after he lost his job at a gas station and his girlfriend was laid off from the factory where she worked.


  After the group initially overwhelmed Guatemalan border security, the Guatemalan government gave special powers to the army to round up and deport more than 3,000 of the migrants back to Honduras, including Ramirez.


  While such large groups garner attention in Washington, the majority of Central Americans who migrate without authorization do so either alone or through smuggling networks, largely out of sight.


  In Guatemala, a low-level smuggler named Pablo, who asked not to use his full name, told Reuters that when trafficking ground to a halt in the spring he rode out his unemployment at a barber shop, charging $1.30 per cut.


  But in recent weeks he has resumed transporting people across the border into Mexico, he said. From there, other members of the smuggling network will help migrants continue their journey northwest, often working with the Sinaloa Cartel to cross the Sonoran desert.


  "We use scouts who search out Border Patrol," he explained. "For every 10 people, usually six get through (the border)."


  Others, like Alvarado and her husband, make the dangerous trek up through Sonora alone, without the expensive services of smugglers. Some will then contract a trafficker to help them with the tricky final leg of the journey.


  Victor Clark, director of the Binational Center for Human Rights in Tijuana and an expert in migration, said the pandemic has forced some smugglers to drop the price of crossing the desert into the United States to as low as $5,000, from $8,000.


  "Central Americans are worn out (economically), and their families in the United States are also absorbing the costs of the pandemic," he said.


  Meanwhile, in the southeastern Mexican state of Veracruz, a few dozen members of the caravan who were able to evade the Guatemalan soldiers and Mexican border officials waited on Tuesday afternoon by the train tracks, aiming to catch a ride further into Mexico.


  "The people are going hungry in Honduras," said Marcos, who didn't give his last name. "So I left to see if I can survive in another country."

Driving habits changed significantly in 2020. The outbreak of the novel coronavirus COVID-19 forced many professionals to work from home full-time. In addition, stay-at-home measures greatly limited how much people could or would travel in their free time. The result was a lot of cars spending a lot of time sitting idly in driveways.


  Just because a car is not being driven very much does not mean its owner can forgo vehicle maintenance. Drivers can take these steps to ensure their vehicles stay in shape even as they’re primarily staying in the driveway.


  • Adhere to recommended maintenance schedules. Auto manufacturers typically recommend maintenance schedules based on the number of miles a car is driven or the length of time since its most recent maintenance appointment. “Whichever comes first” may be recommended for fluid changes and routine tuneups, and this rule of thumb should still be followed. Even if a car has barely hit the road in recent months, its fluids, such as oil, are still aging and still need to be replaced.


  • Turn the car on every so often. Turning the car on, even if you only intend to let it sit idle in the driveway, keeps the vehicle components lubricated by allowing fluids to cycle their way through the engine. Turning the car on also ensures the battery stays fresh and doesn’t die, a lesson many drivers have learned the hard way during the COVID-19 outbreak.


  • Disconnect the battery if necessary. Drivers who own two vehicles or families who have only been using the family car in recent months can disconnect the batteries from their unused vehicles to prevent corrosion. Corrosion decreases battery life and performance. If drivers notice a white, green or blue covering around the battery terminals, posts or cables, corrosion is likely the culprit and the battery will need to be replaced.


  • Take the car for a spin. Of course, driving a vehicle every so often is a great way to keep it running strong. Multi-car families that tend to use the same car to shop for groceries or pick up takeout orders can periodically use their other car to run such errands.


  Cars are sitting idly in driveways more than ever before. Vehicle maintenance must remain a priority even for cars that rarely hit the open road.

The first crash, a plane operated by Indonesia's Lion Air, saw a 737 Max crash into the sea after a malfunction forced it into a fatal nose dive, despite attempts by the pilots to correct it. All 189 people on board died.
 Five months later, a similar error forced an Ethiopian Airlines plane to crash into the ground, killing the 157 people on board and prompting regulators around the world to ground the 737 Max.
 Production was halted in early 2020 while the company addressed design flaws. The 737 Max crashes plunged Boeing into the deepest crisis of its history, leading to canceled orders, layoffs, and the departure of its CEO.
 Approval from major regulators like the EASA to operate once more could give the company a chance to recover.

BRUSSELS, Oct 15 (Reuters) - European Parliament President David Sassoli asked EU leaders on Thursday to increase the bloc's next seven-year budget by 39 billion euros to revive stalled negotiations on a recovery package for the bloc's recession-torn economies.


  Speaking to the European Union's 27 leaders, Sassoli pointed out the extra money, which parliament wants spent on research and development, health, education and security, would be a drop in the bucket compared to the combined 1.8 trillion euro size of the long-term budget and the recovery plan.


  "This is a paltry sum when set against an overall package, but one which would make an enormous difference to the citizens," he said, noting that parliament had made proposals on how to raise the money.


  EU leaders agreed at a marathon summit in July on the seven-year budget and the recovery plan to help lift Europe's economy from its deepest-ever recession caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.


  But the deal must still be approved by EU lawmakers and ratified by member states' national parliaments.


  "At present, the negotiations are stalled. You have it in your hands to get them moving again," Sassoli told the leaders.


  An EU official said Sassoli's appeal met with a cold reception.


  "A series of leaders, starting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, answered him that there is no way the leaders will reopen the July deal. There was full unanimity on this," the official said.


  Sassoli responded by saying the parliament's proposal was a technical adjustment, not a re-opening of the July deal.


  "We are not asking to start again from scratch. It is not about calling into question the July agreement, but taking a small step which would move us closer to final approval of the package," he said.


  Another contentious issue blocking agreement on the 1.8 trillion euro package is a European Parliament demand that the disbursement of the EU money must be clearly linked to national governments observing the rule of law.


  This is anathema to Poland and Hungary, which are under EU investigation for undermining the independence of courts, media and non-governmental organisations. (Reporting by Jan Strupczewski Editing by John Chalmers)

The Jefferson School District Board of Trustees voted unanimously on Tuesday to continue distance learning for its students until at least Jan. 4, 2021, during a virtual Zoom meeting. The board will continue to keep the topic of reopening as an agenda item in its next two meetings on Nov. 10 and Dec. 15 to review data surrounding COVID-19 and set a firmer date for reopening the district's four schools.
 “I would suggest that we look at this again in November and then really look at it in December. Because if we're going to make a decision to bring them back in early January, we would want to make that decision at the December board meeting, so that we can notify staff and parents,” said Superintendent James Bridges during the meeting.
 While other schools in Tracy have already or are currently in the process of reopening their campuses to students this year, JSD has opted to take a watch- and-wait approach in light of the holidays and the height of cold and flu season. This reasoning was reinforced when Bridges read the public comment cards from district faculty, which urged the board to consider delaying school reopenings until more information was available.

Coll Donaldson reckons Ross County need to take a leaf out of Steve Clarke’s tactics book if they want to turn their stuttering season around.


  The Staggies started the new term on fire, collecting seven points from the first nine available.


  But since kicking-off the campaign with back-to-back clean sheets as they registered wins against Motherwell and Hamilton, Stuart Kettlewell’s Dingwall outfit have only managed one other Premiership victory.


  That victory over St Johnstone in Perth was coincidentally their only other shut-out so far and Donaldson knows his team need to stiffen up at the back.


  The big defender has watched out Clarke has transformed Scotland’s fortunes by making his team first and foremost hard to breakdown – and believes the same approach would do wonders for County.


  He said: “It’s a big frustration. The gaffer mentioned it before the Betfred Cup game against Arbroath on Tuesday night that he was looking for a clean sheet so to concede again, albeit to a decent free-kick, was really disappointing.


  “But we’re looking to get back to how we were at the start of the season, hard to beat and shutting teams out.


  “I look at how Scotland are performing right now under Steve Clarke. They are build from the back with some solid foundations and that’s definitely a model that we want to base ourselves on.


  “We want other teams to have to work really hard if they are going to beat us so that Scotland blueprint is what we’re looking at.


  “The basis of any good team is the ability to keep clean sheets and once you do that, you can build from there.


  “There is a consistency element to our performances this season.


  “You can’t have weeks when you’re on it like we were when we got our last clean sheet at St Johnstone then the following week go to Aberdeen and put in a first-half display where we could easily have shipped four goals.


  “You need to have more consistency at this level and that’s something the coaching staff are really drumming into us.”


  Donaldson will come up against a familiar face in Hibernian’s Kevin Nisbet this weekend.


  He was twice part of an Inverness team last term which managed to prevent the then Dunfermline striker from adding to the 23-goal haul which won him a £250,000 move to Easter Road.


  Nisbet is now being tipped for international honours but the prospect of facing the in-form frontman does not faze the Dingwall defender.


  “I played against him twice last year. He’s a decent player and you could definitely see he was a Premiership player playing in the Championship at that stage.


  “He did really well to continue his Raith form on with Dunfermline. Confidence for a striker is a huge thing and he has got an abundance of that right now.


  “I’m looking forward to a tough game but also relishing the challenge.


  “I’m not surprised to see him get tipped for a Scotland call-up. We’ve seen Steve Clarke make it clear if you do well for your club you’ll get a chance.


  “But I’m not worried about that at all. I spent three years in the Championship so now I’m at this level I just look forward to taking on guys likes your Nisbets, your Edouards and your Moreloses. There’s no fear, I just look forward to the challenge.”

At least eight months into the first year of Trump’s presidency, around the time of Charlottesville, a decent and functioning democracy would have gotten rid of the sick fascistic ogre Trump through new elections or legal proceedings for removal. Nothing doing under the Holy Charter. The absurdly venerated 18th Century Constitution mandates savagely and strictly time- staggered presidential elections once every four years. The bar for removal through the impeachment clause is so extremely high that is has been properly deployed only once in American presidential history chock full of sociopathic criminality (Richard Nixon only avoided full removal by impeachment because he resigned before the votes could be cast). A two-thirds vote in the Senate is required for removal, an almost hopelessly unattainable benchmark.

Oct 15 (Reuters) - Taylor Swift, Bradley Cooper and Keith Urban have donated guitars to a celebrity country music auction to raise funds for everyday workers in the industry whose livelihoods have been devastated by the coronavirus pandemic.
 Swift's signed black Gibson acoustic guitar that she played for the live debut performance of her new song "betty" in September, comes along with nine of the singer's custom picks in a lot that could fetch $25,000 to $40,000, Christie's auction house said on Thursday.
 The electric guitar Cooper played as washed-up country singer Jackson Maine in his 2018 film "A Star is Born" is also up for sale, with an estimate of $2,000 to $4,000.
 The auction, starting on Thursday and running until Oct 29, will benefit the Academy of Country Music's Lifting Lives COVID-19 Response Fund, which was created to support people behind the scenes in the country music industry centered around Nashville.
 "When the pandemic hit in the spring, Nashville was hit pretty hard," said Nancy Valentino from Christie's business development department.
 "This is one of the instances where you have the artists helping the people who work with them - tour bus drivers, roadies, session workers, caterers - no one is working," she added.
 Other auction items include a bedazzled dulcimer owned by Dolly Parton for 30 years ($50,000 to $100,000), Sheryl Crow's vintage Baldoni accordion ( $8,000 to $12,000), and guitars owned by Keith Urban, Dwight Yoakam, Blake Shelton and Vince Gill.
 In addition to the instruments, Tim McGraw is auctioning his F131 Hellcat motorcycle, while Carrie Underwood donated the gown she wore to the Academy of Country Music awards show in Nashville in September.
 "We were so impressed by how quickly artists volunteered to donate, and donated things that are so special to them," Valentino said. (Reporting by Jill Serjeant and Andrew Hofstetter; Editing by Bill Berkrot)

  # Celebrate Halloween at Glen Rose's Scare on the Square


  By Jay Hinton


  Glen Rose Reporter


  GLEN ROSE — The Glen Rose Convention and Visitors Bureau, along with the Somervell County Crime Stoppers National Night Out, have teamed up for a spook-tacular event for children of all ages to enjoy a safe and socially distanced Halloween.


  “It was great working with the mayor, city leadership, and businesses to discuss how we can offer some fun for the kiddos in a safer way,” said Kristen Gibson, director of the Glen Rose CVB. “As we've seen with all of our events, everything looks a little different this year, but we are still doing our best to make the changes we need to stay safe and have fun.”


  With the city’s recent sale of Oakdale Park, Gibson said, Boo in the Park was moved to the Square and combined with the Safe Treats on the Square event to create Scare on the Square.


  “Any time we can decorate up, and dress up, we love to do it,” Gibson said. “We do hope that people will enjoy the event, the decorations, and each other's fun costumes.”


  Scare of the Square --- a mask-erade safe treat event --- will be held on Saturday, Oct. 31 from 4-8 p.m., and National Night Out will be held at the same time. National Night Out is generally earlier in October.


  “We got really lucky to be able to be partnering with another great community outreach event,” Gibson said, noting the four-hour timeframe to allow people to come and go and not have so many people at the Square at the same time.


  “It was so fitting that on the same night, the kids will get to meet the heroes of our community, take photos with the mascots and learn about how to stay safe and healthy," she said.


  To promote social distancing, event-goers are encouraged to decorate their masks and face shields and wear their scariest costumes.


  “It was great working with the mayor, city leadership and businesses to discuss how we can offer some fun for the kiddos in a safer way,” she said. “As we've seen with all of our events, everything looks a little different this year, but we are still doing our best to make the changes we need to stay safe, and have fun.”


  Gibson said if anyone can donate a bag of candy or more to any of the downtown businesses, or event participants, it would make a world of difference to many of them.


  “This is a huge undertaking to hand out candy to hundreds of kids each year downtown, and this year, a little bit more,” she said.


  In addition to Scare on the Square and National Night Out, the Somervell County Fall Festival will be held from 10-6 p.m., and the Bull Lion Street Dance will be held from 8-11 p.m.


  For more information about Scare of the Square or sign up to participate, call 254-897-3081 or visit ExploreGlenRose.org for more details.

The stories here aren't about the pitmasters who might first come to mind when you think about the trade, like the 85-year-old Texan a chef named Tootsie, but it's all the better for it.

Seppur si tratta di problemi che sono stati evidenziati ripetutamente nel passato, la cancellazione dei treni per il maltempo e poi le condizioni degli scompartimenti e dei distributori degli igienizzanti aggiungono ulteriori tensioni per chi viaggia, soprattutto in questo periodo della pandemia. Ma andiamo all’organizzazione di difesa dei consumatori di cui è responsabile, per la sede di Patti, Dario Giacoppo. "Dalle numerose segnalazioni dei pendolari della Messina-Palermo emerge un quadro di costanti disservizi di cui abbiamo verificato sul campo la fondatezza." Il sodalizio ha fatto riferimento alle cancellazioni del 13 e 14 ottobre e al fatto che martedì sera i pendolari hanno dovuto attendere la sera, per cui ha chiesto a Trenitalia di intervenire con decisione per evitare altri disservizi e dare risposte chiare all’utenza.

“It’s a kind of spring tide that affects everybody simultaneously,” Rousseau said. “We had a blind spot in our tracking policies. It was the private sphere, festive events.”
 The head of WHO’s Europe office, Dr. Hans Kluge, said most of the spread is happening in homes, indoor spaces and communities not complying with protection measures.
 “These measures are meant to keep us all ahead of the curve and to flatten its course,” Kluge said. “It is therefore up to us to accept them while they are still relatively easy to follow instead of following the path of severity.”
 Still, Paris restaurant, cinema and theater owners are fuming at the new curfew rules. Tighter local restrictions in northern England and Northern Ireland have prompted similar emotions there. London Mayor Sadiq Khan said he expects the British government to announce Thursday that the capital is moving to a higher level of restrictions.
 Just as Macron’s government tackles the resurgence of infections, French police on Thursday searched the homes of the former prime minister, the current and former health ministers and other top officials in an investigation into the government’s pandemic response. It was triggered by dozens of complaints over recent months, particularly over shortages of masks and other equipment.
 Belgium’s Ghent University said it will move to online education whenever possible starting Oct. 26.
 Italy, so far spared the worst of the second wave, on Wednesday also recorded its biggest single-day jump in infections since the start of the pandemic. It added another 7,332 cases amid a resurgence that is straining the country’s contact-tracing system.
 Poland registered a record of nearly 9,000 new cases on Thursday. Masks have been required outdoors since Saturday and strict limits imposed on the size of gatherings.
 Slovakia and Croatia announced record daily case numbers. Slovakia was imposing new restrictions Thursday, once again making it mandatory to wear masks outdoors and shutting fitness centers, public swimming pools, theaters and cinemas.
 Sweden, which has chosen a much-debated approach of keeping large parts of society open, also raised the prospect of tougher restrictions.
 “Too many don’t follow the rules,” Prime Minister Stefan Lofven said. “If there is no correction here, we must take sharper measures.”
 He didn’t specify what those measures might be.

Rematches in the postseason aren’t completely out of the ordinary, but for Hicksville and Tinora, it’s been a game both teams have been itching to play.


  The 5-0 Rams and 4-3 Aces will match up for the second time this season on Saturday at 7 p.m. at Justin F. Coressel Stadium, with the winner advancing to the third round of the Division VI Region 22 playoffs against either Columbus Grove or Ottawa Hills.


  For the 5-0 Rams, the itch being scratched will come from simply taking the field again. Thanks to an unbeaten start to the season, Tinora earned the No. 5 seed in the Division VI Region 22 postseason and the first-round bye that comes with it.


  “It’s been a positive for us, we’ve been able to get kids healed up,” said Tinora head coach Kenny Krouse, entering his 24th season and 11th postseason as Ram head coach. “We’ve always focused on ourselves in these situations and it’s a unique thing coming into this one. No one other than our coaching staff has been in the playoffs. It’s unfamiliar territory.”


  The postseason appearance is the first since 2016 for the program.


  For Krouse, facing a league opponent in the playoffs isn’t unprecedented as the Rams faced Wayne Trace in the 2013 and 2014 playoffs and Fairview in 2007 and 2009.


  “It’s never easy playing an opponent a second time,” said Krouse. “There’s not many secrets and you ratchet things up even more. Everything gets magnified a little more in the playoffs. If you’ve got a weakness, it’s going to get exploited.”


  For Hicksville, the playoffs have already begun as the Aces took down Woodmore 28-16 on home turf for the team’s third win in four games after a 1-2 start. The anticipation for Lucas Smith’s squad comes from a 41-0 home loss to Tinora on Sept. 11.


  “We’re excited about it,” said Smith of the shot at revenge. “We got beat badly by Tinora and Fairview in the regular season and we were hoping to get a shot at one or both of them in the playoffs, depending on the draw.


  “Not to take anything away from Tinora, they were more physical than us and did everything better than us, but we didn’t play our best game. We’ve told our guys, play the caliber of football we’re capable of and let the scoreboard work itself out.”


  The regular-season matchup saw Tinora shake off a scoreless first quarter and snap a four-game losing streak to the Aces with 358 total yards rushing and three rushing TDs from bruising fullback Christian Commisso.


  The Aces are also left thinking what might have been after not taking advantage of two missed first-half field goals and also turning the ball over on downs at the Tinora 20 and 10. The opening drive of the second half made things 20-0 Tinora and the Rams cruised from there.


  Both sides will lean on the running game for success, though in different fashions.


  Tinora’s well-honed Wing-T offense has had plenty of contributors, led by junior halfback KP Delarber with 529 yards and four scores.


  6-2, 210-pound sophomore fullback Christian Commisso has been a load, rushing for 397 yards and eight scores, including 13 rushes for 100 yards in the Rams’ most recent contest, a 39-21 win over Fairview on Oct. 2. Brandon Edwards, a sophomore, scored three times against the Pilots and has 201 yards and six TDs to his credit.


  Veteran QB Nolan Schafer has three passing TDs (31-of-46, 468 yards) and four rushing scores to his credit with senior wideout Max Grube catching 13 passes for 244 yards and a score.


  “It’s going to be consistency,” said Smith of keys to success on Saturday. “Not just with our scheme and quality of play but of our speed and our focus. They’re going to hit you with dives and traps and counters and then all of a sudden they can hit you with a play-action pass for a 50-yard touchdown.”


  Hicksville QB Landon Turnbull has turned into one of a two-headed backfield behemoth for the Aces, rushing for 827 yards and 11 touchdowns, including 166 yards and three TDs against Woodmore.


  Turnbull has totaled 767 passing yards and three scores as well this season. The Aces’ signal-caller has a solid backfield mate in senior Kole Wertman with 703 yards on 81 carries and 10 scores to his credit.


  6-5 junior Jackson Bergman is a threat on the outside with 24 catches for 308 yards this season while Kyler Baird (Jr., 14 catches, 197 yards, two TDs) and Brody Balser (So., 13 catches, 109 yards, one TD) are also targets.


  “Turnovers and field position are always keys but in the playoffs, you’ve got to be able to run the football,” said Krouse. “Turnbull’s carried the load a lot more here lately so we’ve got to play assignment football, that’s paramount for us. Each kid’s got to know their assignment and we’ve got to be ready when they run that option.”

Now, before any of you ask, no, this is not a game version of the terrible Eddie Murphy film _The Haunted Mansion_ , and thank goodness for that. It's been more than fairly common for a film to have a companion game released with it especially in the science fiction or action genres which lend themselves to gaming. The experts call that synergy. What most gamers or people that cover the gaming industry will swiftly attest to is that most movie tie-in games tend to be pretty awful. Development of the gameplay and storyline aren't usually priority. The priority is to get the game out and capitalize on the hopeful success of the film by making fans want to play the game after they see the movie. In this case _The Haunted Mansion_ game was released in October of 2003 followed by the film in November. Seems like synergy was in play and yet, there's no trace of Eddie Murphy in the game nor is there much similarity in the storylines. I looked into it and couldn't find too much background on why the game was different considering the fact that they were essentially released simultaneously. Perhaps a star of Murphy's caliber didn't want to be represented in the videogame? Perhaps the finished movie wasn't living up to expectations and therefore the game was changed? At any rate, not being too closely associated with the film version isn't such a bad thing in this case.

The Cornwall, SDG and Prescott-Russell area continued to see a steady climb of confirmed COVID-19 cases over the Thanksgiving weekend -- there are now 105 active cases of the virus in the Eastern Ontario Health Unit's (EOHU) territory.
 EOHU medical officer of health Dr. Paul Roumeliotis told media during his Tuesday briefing his health unit had added 31 cases since Friday -- 11 on Monday and 20 on Tuesday. Of the 31 cases, 23 are in Prescott-Russell, seven in SDG and one in Cornwall.
 Most of the 31 cases stem from two long-term care home outbreaks that were recorded in the area. One is at the Prescott-Russell Residence in Hawkesbury whereas the other is at Alexandria's Palace long-term care home.
 There are 25 cases of the virus at the Prescott-Russell Residence -- 17 residents and eight staff members. Roumeliotis said seven residents but no staff member at the Alexandria Palace Retirement Home, had tested positive for the virus.
 "This (outbreak at Prescott-Russell Residence) started as an outbreak, a respiratory outbreak," he said. "We tested symptomatic individuals on a certain floor and then some came back positive. Subsequently, we've tested everybody there, the residents and the staff members. We're waiting for results for about half of the tests we've administered."
 Roumeliotis added he could not give a definitive answer as to how the virus had penetrated both the long-term care homes. Tracing work is currently underway by the health unit.
 There are now three facility outbreaks, the third being at the Foyer St- Jacques Nursing Home in Embrun.

That, too, is under legal challenge, and rightly so. The Constitution clearly states that the census must count residents, not citizens, and that seats in the House must be divided “among the several States according to their respective numbers, counting the whole number of persons in each State.” As a practical matter, to exclude noncitizens from the reapportionment count would skew the makeup of the House, leaving states with higher numbers of immigrants (like California) with fewer representatives. The Pew Research Center estimates about 22.8 million immigrants — including those living here legally — are not U.S. citizens. That’s roughly 7% of the people living in the country.
 The COVID-19 pandemic has made just about everything more difficult, and earlier this year the Trump administration told Congress that it needed more time and money to ensure an accurate count. The Commerce Department also said it could not report the state-by-state population counts to the president by the end of the year, as the law requires, but would need until the end of April 2021. That report tells the House how many seats each state is entitled to; notably, the government also uses the census data to decide how to distribute as much as $1.5 trillion a year in federal funds.
 But Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross reversed course in August and announced, over the objection of census experts, that the count deadline would be moved up to Sept. 30 so the Census Bureau could start processing the data (and taking reckless shortcuts, critics say) to meet the Dec. 31 reporting deadline. After the National Urban League and other advocacy groups sued, lower courts ordered that the count continue through October. On Tuesday, however, the U.S. Supreme Court decided that the Commerce Department could end the count now in order to finish processing the numbers by Dec. 31.

  The biggest shareholder in Air Canada (AC) and Transat Inc said on Tuesday that AC's revised offer for the Canadian tour operator was "a very reasonable one," given the turmoil in the international aviation industry amid the global pandemic.      Peter Letko, a co-founder of investment manager Letko Brosseau, called the deal "good news" but said that the company would wait to see if a rival bidder emerged before committing to the Air Canada offer.      On October 10, Air Canada, which is Canada's biggest airline, cut the deal value to buy Transat by nearly 75 percent to about C$188.7 million ($143.9 million), which was down from C$720 million, as COVID-19 weighs on travel demand.      Air Canada's revised offer has raised optimism that the proposed deal, once shaken by the COVID-19 pandemic, could be completed.      With the pandemic grounding flights globally, Air Canada had faced shareholder pressure to renegotiate the deal, which is still pending approval from European and Canadian regulators.      "The price is a long way from what we agreed...but it's clear that the industry has gone through a period where it's really suffered," Letko told Reuters in a phone interview. "If nothing transpires, I think the Air Canada offer is a very reasonable one."      Letko Brosseau owns an 8.69-percent stake in Air Canada and almost 15 percent of Transat, according to Refinitiv data.      As part of the revised deal, the purchase price could be paid to Transat shareholders either in cash or shares of Air Canada, which Letko called interesting.      Analysts said the revised price would give Air Canada greater motivation to conclude the deal, which had previously been believed to be on thin ice.      Due to the fallout of the coronavirus pandemic outbreak worldwide, the global aviation industry will lose an estimated $419 billion by 2020, and airlines around the world will lose $84.3 billion in profits, according to the International Air Transport Association, which has said that global aviation will not recover to 2019 levels until 2024.      Meanwhile, AC ended 2019 with a cash balance of C$6 billion, and it has also taken steps to push its liquidity well beyond C$7 billion. But similar to all airlines worldwide, the Canadian carrier is aiming to reduce its cash burn, according to the travel market intelligence   provider CAPA.      "COVID-19 has resulted in significant uncertainty for the airline industry, which made us doubt whether the combination of TRZ and AC would even occur," Desjardins analyst Benoit Poirier said in a note to clients on Tuesday.      "We believe the revised agreement offers incentives for AC to obtain regulatory approvals for the transaction."      The deal requires approval by Transat shareholders, who are set to vote on the transaction in early December.      One portfolio manager who holds AC stock said he believed that Transat shareholders would have little option other than to approve it.      "This is the best that they are going to get in this environment."      The company's total revenues fell from $4.73 billion in the second quarter of 2019 to $527 million in the second quarter this year, a decline of $4.21 billion or 89 percent, in light of the Air Canada Reports Second Quarter 2020 Results released in July.

Given that Barrett could be ruling on constitutional issues for decades, that strategy seemed shortsighted. But it reminded voters about Republicans’ relentless efforts to kill the ACA, even during the COVID-19 pandemic. And it led Barrett to acknowledge that the court could strike down the ACA provision that the lawsuit challenges without invalidating the rest of the law.
 The Democrats’ other goal was to portray Barrett as someone who would do the bidding of the president who appointed her, not only in the healthcare case but also in possible disputes over the results of the presidential election. Barrett bristled at the suggestion that “I would allow myself to be used as a pawn to decide this election for the American people.” The problem is that Trump put Barrett in an impossible position when he said before she was nominated that “it’s very important that we have nine justices” to resolve election disputes. For the sake of the court’s credibility, she would need to recuse herself from any case connected to the election.
 Despite their pleas for delay, Democrats seem to have recognized that Barrett will be confirmed. The result was a process more decorous than the hearings for Trump’s first two nominees, Neil M. Gorsuch and Brett M. Kavanaugh. But the civility of the proceedings can’t obscure the partisan divide that this nomination has widened.
 The Supreme Court’s legitimacy with the public depends on a perception that it is above partisan politics. That image has been sullied by 5-4 decisions in which justices appointed by Republicans are on one side and those appointed by Democrats are on the other. But it’s also marred by the relentless politicization of the Senate confirmation process. Ultimately, the solution may be to reduce the stakes dramatically by giving justices a fixed term on the high court, with the terms staggered so that all presidents will be able to fill at least one seat.

  Laurent stifled the Tiger lineup through her first three innings. After Schultz greeted her with a single, Laurent retired 10 Tigers in a row before KK Laux drew a walk, Faith Molina singled, and Hudson left the yard.


  Northwest failed to capitalize on a Hastings error in the fifth, stranding a runner on third. The Vikings left a runner in scoring position in the sixth, as well.


  The big hit finally came for Hastings, which had more than a handful in its earlier win over Elkhorn.


  A three-run blast by Schultz helped the Tigers grow a 12-0 lead after the first two innings, but the Antlers crawled all the way back to tie the game in the fifth inning.


  After racking up 12 hits in two innings, Hastings mustered only two between the third and sixth.


  Hastings quickly answered Elkhorn’s tying run with a pair in the sixth. Curtis, who launched her second home run of the season in the second inning, singled and was scored by Cerveny’s fifth hit of the game. Cerveny eventually came around on an Elkhorn error.


  Watching that large of a lead evaporate was worrisome. So, too, was trailing out of the gate against Northwest. But Hastings dug deep.


  “We got a little nervous early with Faith giving up some hits, but (we) continually just show up and play every day,” Speak said.


  The Tigers (32-4) earned a rematch with Norris, which lost to Skutt 4-0 in the winner’s bracket final.


  Norris and Hastings have split two matchups this season — both were one-run ball games.


  Skutt, which is undefeated in the tournament at 3-0, will have to be beaten twice in the championship round. Hastings beat the SkyHawks earlier this season 8-4.

Oct 15 (Reuters) - The stage adaptation of Alanis Morissette's album "Jagged Little Pill," led nominations for the annual Tony Awards on Thursday although Broadway theatres remain dark in a prolonged pandemic shutdown until summer of 2021.
 "Jagged Little Pill," inspired by the Canadian-born singer's best-selling 1995 album, got 15 nominations including best musical and nods for six of its actors including star Elizabeth Stanley.
 The rock musical, whose themes include sexual assault, drug addiction and female empowerment, opened on Broadway in December 2019, but like all live shows in New York City was forced to close in mid-March as the coronavirus pandemic hit the city. The Broadway closure was extended last week to June 2021.
 The pandemic also postponed the annual Tony Awards, which usually take place in June. The shortened Broadway season meant a reduced number of Tony nominations on Thursday and a new date for the awards ceremony, which is expected to be mostly virtual, has yet to be announced.
 "Moulin Rouge! The Musical," based on the 2001 movie by Baz Luhrmann, got 14 Tony nominations on Thursday, including best musical.
 "At such a difficult time for so many people, including the thousands who make up the industry behind the scenes, we welcome this opportunity to take a moment to celebrate the remarkable achievements of our finest artists," Carmen Pavlovic, producer of "Moulin Rouge! The Musical," said in a statement.
 "Slave Play," about sex, race and inter-racial relationships, got 12 nods, setting a record for the most nominations for a stage play in Broadway history.
 "The Inheritance," a two-part play about gay culture in New York a generation after the AIDS epidemic, got 11 nods.
 Broadway has attracted some of Hollywood's biggest stars in recent years. Nominations on Thursday went to Jake Gyllenhaal ("Sea Wall/A Life"), Tom Hiddleston ("Betrayal"), and Laura Linney ("My Name is Lucy Barton").

No matter whether your roadless area is in Idaho or Montana, creative logic in environmental reviews helps the Forest Service justify selling your roadless trees to timber interests. My review of the National Environmental Policy Act documents that authorized these sales revealed common justifications. The Forest Service maintains, in the face of contradictory science, that allowing natural historical ecological processes like fire or beetle-kill to play its role would hurt ecosystems. (Logging will save ecosystems!) If the Forest Service finds a roadless area with no uncut trees, cutting some trees would have minimal impacts. (Logging won’t cause that much damage!) If someone cut some trees in the roadless area half a century ago, roadless characteristics already fall short of a pristine and untouched wild area. (Logging won’t cause that much more damage!) Trees can grow back. (Logging has only temporary effects!) The Forest Service would only allow logging on one percent of roadless wildlands while exercising restraint in selling logging rights to the rest of the roadless area. (Logging a tiny bit here and there is okay!) Added up, the public has possibly lost up to 59,000 acres of roadless country to these justifications—and those were just in Idaho and Montana over the span of eight years. With at bare minimum of 59,000 acres cut in just the past decade, these losses will only continue to pile up. To my knowledge, nobody has dug into other states where the same Forest Service is implementing RACR or in Colorado, the only other state with its own roadless rule. We need to scrutinize what the Forest Service has been doing under our noses because have lost and continue to lose wild areas that, for two decades, we have assumed the roadless rules and our government have protected.

Adds latest number of ballots cast, details of North Carolina voting, comment from Biden campaign, Hollywood protest letter)
 By Trevor Hunnicutt and Joseph Ax
 Oct 15 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump and Democratic challenger Joe Biden will hold dueling prime-time town halls on Thursday instead of a second debate, which was to have been held virtually, as early voters continued to swamp polling places.
 Trump pulled out of the scheduled debate when the commission in charge of organizing the event said it would be held virtually after he contracted the coronavirus. A final debate is still scheduled for Oct. 22 in Nashville, Tennessee.
 With less than three weeks to go until the Nov. 3 vote, the Republican president is searching for ways to change the dynamics of a race in which Biden has a double-digit advantage in some national polls.
 More than 17 million Americans have cast ballots either in person or by mail so far, representing 12.5% of the total votes counted in the 2016 general election, according to the U.S. Elections Project at the University of Florida.
 Voters are seeking to avoid in-person lines on Election Day to stay safe as coronavirus infections and hospitalizations continue to rise, but are also concerned about the possibility that Trump will challenge widely used mail-in ballots, after he claimed without evidence that they are fraudulent.
 North Carolina, a highly competitive state, began more than two weeks of in- person early voting on Thursday.
 Video from local media showed large numbers of people waiting for the polls to open in Greensboro and Winston-Salem, and gathering in the pre-dawn hours to vote at two arenas in the state's largest city of Charlotte.
 Gerry Cohen, a member of the election board in the county that includes most of the city of Raleigh, reported more than 400 people waiting in line at a community center before polls opened.
 "I've never seen this many in line here," he said on Twitter.
 Trump's campaign is counting on a surge of last-minute votes. But Reuters/Ipsos polling conducted between Oct. 9 and Oct. 13 shows there are far fewer undecided likely voters this year - around 8% - and they are just as likely to pick Biden as they are Trump.
 Four years ago at this stage of the campaign, more than twice as many people were similarly wavering between Trump and his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton.
 The Reuters/Ipsos polling shows Biden holding a 10 percentage-point lead nationally, with a tighter margin in the battleground states that will help decide the election.
 Both candidates have been visiting those states this week, with Trump holding rallies in Florida, Pennsylvania and Iowa and Biden traveling to Ohio and Florida.
 Trump has pulled into a statistical tie with Biden in Florida, a key battleground, with 47% support versus Biden's 49%, and a credibility interval of 4 points, a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll showed.
 Thursday's town halls, in which each candidate will field questions from voters, will take place at 8 p.m. EDT (0000 GMT), with Trump on NBC from Miami and Biden on ABC from Philadelphia.
 A group of 100 Hollywood actors and producers wrote a letter of protest to NBC, saying airing Trump's town hall was "enabling the President's bad behavior while undercutting the Presidential Debate Commission and doing a disservice to the American public."
 On Thursday, the Biden campaign said two people involved in the campaign had tested positive for COVID-19, including one on the staff of U.S. Senator Kamala Harris, Biden's running mate.
 Although neither Biden nor Harris was in close contact with the people, the campaign said it was cancelling Harris' travel until after Sunday.
 "This shows how seriously we take COVID, how we have since March done everything in our power as a campaign to ensure the safety of our staff and volunteers and voters," Biden's campaign manager, Jen O'Malley Dillon, told reporters on a call.

She said already Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York and New Jersey have brought back Roulette and that the state Department of Public Health (DPH) was amenable to allowing Roulette with precautions. Some of the precautions include only having three players to a table, and all are required to be seated, the MGC rules stated. Unlike in normal Roulette, no patrons would be permitted to gather or observe at the tables, and players/dealers would be separated by a six-foot Plexiglas barrier. Likewise, all bets have to be in before the ball starts rolling in the game – which is unlike the typical game where bets are taken while the ball spins around the wheel.

According to him, the security agencies lack the requisite tools and capacity to effectively deal with criminal activities which is the reason such activities have witnessed a rise recently.      Adam Bonaa said in a Citi FM interview that the government’s decision to focus on the security of the members of parliaments is irrational and in bad fate.      He protested that the when the security of the entire country is jeopardy, protection for a privileged few is ‘knee jerk and needless’.      “Obviously, this is not a step in the right direction. It is needless, we just do not put police escort out there. It is a knee-jerk reaction, what science went into the decision? If you do not have a security intelligence unit, there is nothing you can do. You can put 1,000 security or military officers around an MP, and they could be ambushed because they lack intelligence.”      His comments come on the back of the deployment of 200 police officers to guard the MPs.      The move by government is an answer to a request by members of the august house after the MP for Mfantseman constituency was murdered by suspected armed robbers.

Empire's deadliest incarnation was born from the deeds of self-righteous wicked men. This thing that would someday colonize the earth was a colony itself. The great empires of Europe had sent their deadliest killers to the stony shores of the New World in search of treasure to plunder. They found a strange new hemisphere ripe for rape and honey. The English soon established the colonies that would serve host to a new Rome. They had no idea what evil they had unleashed. Centuries of savagery, of genocide and slavery, had created an insatiable hunger in the men who would be declared this new nation's founding fathers. They wanted more. They wanted so much more. And they weren't content to share their spoils with the Queen. They wanted their own crown. London realized that their greed had given birth to a monster more wicked than their wildest dreams. Terrified, they rushed to pull the plug on their Amerikan murder machine, but it was already too late. After attempting to hobble it's march to power by curtailing the slave trade and granting recognition to the Indian Nations still standing on it's frontier, the Founding Fathers launched a successful coup against their English overlords and declared the fitful farce a revolution. These psychopaths perverted the name of democracy much the way Rome and England had Christianity, and used its hollowed out title to justify the greatest killing spree in the history of mankind.

Adds detail, Dutch reaction)
 MOSCOW, Oct 15 (Reuters) - Russia's foreign ministry said on Thursday it was withdrawing from talks with the Netherlands and Australia over the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, accusing both countries of not wanting to establish what really happened.
 MH17 was flying from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur when it was shot down by a missile fired from territory held by pro-Russian rebels during fighting in eastern Ukraine, international investigators say. All 298 people on board were killed.
 After years of collecting evidence, a Dutch-led international Joint Investigation team (JIT) last year said the missile launcher used to hit the civilian airplane came from a Russian army base just across the border.
 The Russian foreign ministry said its decision to withdraw from consultations with the Netherlands and Australia came in response to a Dutch government suit filed against Moscow at the European Court of Human Rights in July this year.
 "Such unfriendly actions by the Netherlands make it meaningless to continue our participation in tripartite talks," the ministry said in a statement, calling the Dutch-led investigations into the downing "biased, superficial and politicised".
 "Australia and the Netherlands did not seek to understand what really happened in the summer of 2014, but instead were aiming to get Russia to admit guilt and receive compensation for the victims' relatives," the ministry added.
 Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said he was surprised by Russia's unilateral decision to stop negotiations on its liability for the downing of flight MH17, as well as by the timing.
 "This is painful for the next of kin," he told Dutch media in Brussels.
 Rutte said the Netherlands would continue negotiations with Australia to "accommodate the 298 victims and their relatives".
 In separate comments, Dutch Foreign Minister Stef Blok said the Netherlands "greatly regrets" the Russian decision to quit the talks.

When asked about this by a deputy, Camp reportedly admitted to taking the signs, saying that their presence was a violation of the district’s code.
 A resolution passed by the Board of Supervisors on Feb. 7, 1997, states that political and off-site commercial lawn signs are prohibited on a Sun ‘N Lake road right of way because it hampers maintenance of that shoulder.
 District General Manager Tanya Cannady told the Highlands News-Sun that the district has no prohibitions against signs on private property.
 Camp was not an elected official for the improvement district at the time of the incident.
 Deputies sent an offense report to the State Attorney’s Office last week, which then filed the case for prosecution with the Highlands County Clerk of Court on Wednesday, for petit theft in the second degree, first offense.
 Camp is currently a candidate in the Nov. 3 election for one of two available popularly-elected seats on the Sun ‘N Lake Board of Supervisors.
 The other two candidates are incumbent supervisors, Raymond Brooks and Joe Branson.
 Camp has served on the board in the past, appointed in 2016 to fill a seat vacated by the late supervisor Richard Miller.
 Camp later resigned from the board on Nov. 7, 2018, while serving as board president.
 His resignation letter at the time gave no reason, but he suggested during a candidate’s forum on Sept. 28 that it was because of needing to devote time to family.
 He also pointed out that night that six supervisors have stepped down in the last seven years, for various reasons, many of them personal.
 Camp also ran for the board in January to complete the last two years of the term vacated by Dan Stegall, but Craig Herrick won that election when large landowners voted their lots.

Euro zone periphery govt bond yields http://tmsnrt.rs/2ii2Bqr (Adds quotes, details)
 By Saikat Chatterjee
 LONDON, Oct 15 (Reuters) - German government bond yields fell to seven-month lows on Thursday as rising coronavirus cases in Europe raised concern that the prospect of more lockdowns would deal another body blow to the struggling euro zone economy.
 France imposed curfews while other European nations are closing schools, cancelling surgeries and enlisting student medics as overwhelmed authorities face the nightmare scenario of a COVID-19 resurgence at the onset of winter. [
 In the United Kingdom, tighter COVID-19 lockdowns could be imposed on London and northern England by Prime Minister Boris Johnson's government on Thursday.
 "The prospect of more localised lockdowns would hurt economic activity when they are already struggling and that is weighing on the bond markets," said Justin Onuekwusi, portfolio manager at Legal & General Investment Management.
 Yields on perceived safe-haven German government bonds for 10-year maturities fell more than 5 bps to -0.627%, the lowest since mid-March. Yields have fallen nearly 10 bps this week.
 The rally in core European government debt spread to other bond markets like France and Belgium where yields also fell to their lowest levels since March as authorities prepare to lock down parts of their economies.
 Even before the latest round of restrictions, data this week showed the European economy was losing steam by the end of the third quarter.
 Germany will recover more slowly from the coronavirus pandemic than originally predicted, its leading economic research institutes forecast on Wednesday, while the euro zone's industrial production reading for August slowed sharply.
 While new infections in emerging markets are starting to edge down, they have risen in advanced economies – developed markets now account for about 30% of new cases, compared to 25% a month ago, Capital Economics said.
 Italy, Croatia, Slovenia and Bosnia reported record figures of new daily infections.
 NO MORE STIMULUS
 The risk-off mood in global bond markets reverberated widely with a rally in peripheral European government debt markets including Italy stalling on Thursday as investors took profits.
 Italian 10-year bond yields were trading at 0.70% after falling to a record low at 0.634% on Wednesday
 That yanked the spread between German and Italian bonds to more than 130 bps on Thursday from 119 bps in the previous session.
 Spanish yields also firmed as the government said it would issue debt to compensate for any potential delay in the approval and disbursement of EU rescue funds.
 Elsewhere, U.S. Treasury yields dived to a two-week low of 0.6960% as the prospects of fresh U.S. stimulus before the Nov. 3 presidential election faded.
 Downbeat comments from U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin that a stimulus deal was unlikely before the vote provided one of several reasons for profit- taking.
 "Data today is expected to confirm U.S. economic sentiment is deteriorating, U.S. fiscal stimulus remains some way off and a hard Brexit remains likely," Mizuho strategists said.

The British government is sticking to its strategy of tiered, regional restrictions to combat Covid-19 amid mounting political and scientific pressure for stronger nationwide measures to prevent the coronavirus pandemic from spiraling out of control.Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab on Friday reiterated the government's belief that a regional approach where the toughest restrictions are imposed only in the areas where infection rates are highest is the best way to slow the spread of the virus and protect the economy."I think the right thing, both on public health grounds but also supporting the economy, supporting jobs, livelihoods, supporting our society and the most vulnerable in it, is to avoid a second national lockdown," Raab told Sky News.The government has been under fire since Prime Minister Boris Johnson unveiled his three-tier strategy on Monday amid revelations that scientific advisers had recommended a short nationwide lockdown to slow rapidly rising infection rates. Leaders of northern cities have refused to accept the tightest restrictions unless the government provides more support to cushion the impact on business and individuals.Opposition politicians accuse ministers of doing too little, too late.Jeremy Farrar, an infectious disease specialist who sits on the government's scientific advisory panel, said Friday that restrictions imposed under the three-tier strategy aren't tough enough to bring the virus under control, and that squabbling over where and when to impose the measures risks confusing the public.Calling the situation the "worst of all worlds" Farrar said the UK needs to quickly implement tighter restrictions nationwide to slow the spread of the virus and limit broader damage to society."I think we've got to come together as a country," Farrar told the BBC. "The fragmentation and, frankly, making this either a north-south or a party political issue, that's a very, very dangerous route to go on."London and seven other areas will move into the second-highest risk tier on Saturday, leading to increased restrictions on more than 11 million people. So far, only the northwestern city of Liverpool has been placed into the top risk tier, which requires the closure of pubs and bars, and bans social gatherings between people from different households.Raab said negotiations are continuing with officials in Manchester, Lancashire about moving those areas into the top tier as well."We will keep talking and we'll keep working," Raab said. "Obviously, in the last resort the government has the powers to proceed in any event, but we would much rather work with the local leaders if at all possible."

  Five months later, a similar error forced an Ethiopian Airlines plane to crash into the ground, killing the 157 people on board and prompting regulators around the world to ground the 737 Max.


  Production was halted in early 2020 while the company addressed design flaws. The 737 Max crashes plunged Boeing into the deepest crisis of its history, leading to canceled orders, layoffs, and the departure of its CEO.

  Leaving Galzignano Terme, the riders will enter the Euganean hills, ancient volcanoes that overlook the Padovan-Venetian plain, where there are two fourth-category climbs. The first to Roccolo (averaging 8.3 per cent over 4.1km) comes in two parts, the first rising up the Muro di Vallorta, where the gradient briefly touches 20 per cent, and the second continuing to Roccolo, where there's another abrupt ramp that's almost as steep.


  Leaving Rivadolmo there's a second "wall", this time the Muro di Calaone, which is just a tad under 10 per cent gradient for 2.1 kilometres. Like the Vallorta, it takes a narrow, twisting route through dense woodland and offers the chance for punchy climbers to ambush the sprinters. Cresting this climb, there are 16 kilometres to cover io the finish, initially winding through a series of small villages until, on the approach to Monselice, the road runs straight and wide. This will give the sprinters' teams an opportunity to reel in any riders who have taken flight.


  The run-in is comparatively straightforward, until an extremely sharp left- hand bend 400 metres from the line. The battle to be in the vanguard at this point will be especially fierce, as whichever team secure it will probably win the day.",

HINGHAM -- Private youth sports teams are helping to drive recent increases in coronavirus cases in the town, a Hingham official said on Tuesday.


  "We're all very concerned about these developments," said Town Administrator Tom Mayo.


  During a board of selectmen meeting on Tuesday, Mayo said private teams are seeing a "troubling increase" in coronavirus cases. This especially applies to teams that play indoor sports, particularly ice hockey, basketball and indoor soccer.


  In some instances, the Hingham Health Department has told entire teams to self-quarantine after potential exposure in the virus.


  While the teams seeing cases are not Hingham Public School teams, Mayo said, the cases are impacting people with ties to the school system.


  A cluster epidemiologist from the state government is examining some of the outbreaks, he said.


  Mayo urged residents to stay home and not attend school and work if they have been around someone who's tested positive for the virus, and to cooperate with contact tracers from the town and state.


  "Ignoring an order to quarantine… puts everyone at risk," he said.


  The town is also seeing an increase in transmission of the virus among members of the same household. Mayo encouraged residents who are quarantining to keep away from others in their house, to not share food and to use separate bedrooms and bathrooms if possible.


  For the past month, Hingham has been in the "yellow," or moderate, risk zone for coronavirus transmission according to the Massachusetts Department of Public Health. The town has seen an uptick in virus cases in recent weeks following months with relatively low case numbers compared to neighboring towns.


  Mayo said the town is "on the cusp" of moving into the "red," or high-risk zone for transmission rates.


  "We certainly hope it doesn't happen. The only way to avoid it is for everyone in this community to start taking this seriously and follow the guidance," he said.


  In response to concerns about scam callers pretending to be contact tracers, Interim Police Chief David Jones said a genuine contact tracing caller will never ask for a person's date of birth or social security number. He advised residents to never give out sensitive personal information over the phone.


  If a resident has concerns about a call, "you can always get a number and call somebody back," he said.

“Staying at this level was the priority in years one and two, but this year we would like to finish in the top half and see if we can sneak in to the play- offs.”
 Castle have won three and drawn two of their opening five league fixtures as their young squad continues to be nurtured by experienced campaigner Van der Laan.
 They take a break from the bread and butter tomorrow as they host Belper Town in the FA Trophy - but the clash will still prove to be a good indicator of the progress being made.
 Belper are currently top of Castle’s division, although they make the journey on the back of a 4-3 loss at Stocksbridge Park Steels in midweek - a game where they led three times.
 “We know what Belper are all about. They are difficult to play against and very direct,” added the Newcastle manager.
 “We drew 2-2 at their place last season and should have won, and the home fixture was a very tight affair.
 “It’s important that we are prepared for the battle, although in the last couple of years we’ve gone from being boys to men.
 “We’re not getting bullied anymore and not giving things away to the opposition.”
 Newcastle’s excellent start continued last weekend when they demolished Carlton Town 6-1 at home.

TAUNTON -- City government is in the process of moving into the newly renovated, rebuilt and expanded City Hall on Summer Street. Mayor Shaunna O'Connell said they are excited to be doing so, as it not only gives them more space and a modern set up to work with, but because it will allow them to better serve their constituents.
 "It's much more functional than where we are now at the old school. We're really excited to be moving to our beautiful, restored City Hall." O'Connell said during a tour last week. " ...There are such beautiful views here in our building that give you a deep sense of appreciation for our community, our history and for all our citizens in the city of Taunton."
 According to the Mayor's Office, though most City offices are not where they used to be, the renovated building's layout is more conducive to public use for many reasons. Firstly, if entering from the rear parking lot, the most frequented City offices are easily accessible. The City Clerk and Tax Collector's offices are on the first floor as you enter the building, and the Veteran's and Registrar of Voters offices are on the street level if entering from Summer Street.
 We can deliver news just like this directly to your inbox. You can sign up for This Just In (a daily newsletter that comes out at 7:30 p.m. each evening with items we've posted that day), News Alerts (so you don't miss anything important), our Daily Newsletter (sent each morning) and more. It's customized to your preferences -- and it'll only take a few seconds.
 Secondly, the City Council chamber is now handicap accessible.
 The first floor of the building, at the rear parking level, also holds the Treasurer's and IT department offices. The second floor, level with Summer Street, also houses the Assessor's and Clerk of Committee's Offices. On the third floor is the Office of Economic and Community Development and the Auditor's Office, and the fourth floor houses the Mayor's, Law and Budget Director's offices.
 City officials are moving back into the building for the first time in a decade. Originally built in 1848, it was damaged in an arson fire in 2010 which forced City Government out and into a temporary city hall on Oak Street fashioned out of an old elementary school.
 After years of deliberation, construction began on the building in February 2019, and is just now concluding. The project cost $27 million.
 "A lot of work has gone into this over the last few years by people too numerous to mention, but we appreciate all our efforts," O'Connell said.
 The project preserved many of the building's history features, such as antique fireplaces and vaults. O'Connell said this is one of her favorite things about the renovated building, as it respects the city's long history.
 O'Connell also said the space and facilities at the new building stand in stark contrast to that available to them at the temporary City Hall. During the tour, she described many offices at the Oak Street building as being "like a closet."
 "It's a big difference here, and it really will give our employees the ability to serve the public so much better," she said.
 All City Offices will be operational in the building by Oct. 15. Tours of the building will begin Saturday, Oct. 17. Registration is required before the tour and is available on the City's website through the mayor's tab.

A Waverly elementary school principal who said that the district superintendent made "very explicit and detailed sexual remarks" toward her has resigned, along with the high school principal.


   


  Tammy Hermes and Brian Cook submitted their resignations on Friday a day after the district's board of education approved the return of Superintendent Dustin Day from an administrative leave.


   


  Day's first day back was Tuesday.


   


  Hermes, who is in the fourth year as principal and in her eighth year with the district, alleged Day's misconduct has gone on since he came to the district from Tri-City in 2015.


   


  Hermes and Cook made an initial complaint about sexual harassment and ethical concerns regarding Day in early September to board president Mike Keeton and vice president Ted Mies. The complaint prompted the board to hire a St. Louis- based law firm to look into Day's behavior.


   


  The investigator's findings were presented to board members at an Oct. 1 special meeting but tabled without action. At another special meeting on Oct. 8, the board allowed Day to return to his role "with some specific directives," including sexual harassment training, according to the board's resolution.


   


  That led to Hermes and Cook, who is in his second year as high school principal, to resign.


   


  The resolution, Hermes contended, didn't offer anything punitive to Day. Hermes and Cook would have had to go through the same sexual harassment training as Day, if they had stayed.


   


  "I don't need (sexual harassment training)," Hermes. "I'm well aware of what that is.


   


  "To me, integrity is everything," Hermes added. "It comes down to right is right and wrong is wrong. The sexual harassment and ethical misconduct was proven to be valid and to allow that to run our school. I can't be a part of that. It goes against everything I believe in morally and ethically and I hope what the public sees is that it's OK to stand up for yourself. It's not OK to be mistreated and devalued."


   


  Cook also said he couldn't continue working in the district.


   


  "I felt the things I stand for were not conveyed in that decision (to let Day return) and I felt I would definitely be a target moving forward and that would not be a good environment for myself, my staff or the students," Cook said, also Wednesday. "I didn't feel there were any protections in there for (either of) us.


   


  "I won't compromise what I believe in just for a job."


   


  The school board met Wednesday and accepted the resignations of Hermes and Cook, but tabled naming interim administrators, including Scott Hendricks, a high school physical education teacher and athletic director who was being considered.


   


  Wednesday's meeting drew about 100 people to the high school's gym.


   


  Hermes and Cook both spoke at the meeting from prepared statements.


   


  Earlier Wednesday, Hermes recounted that she has made previous overtures to the board about Day's conduct, with no success. She added that "I know I'm not the only one he's made inappropriate comments to (at the school)."


   


  With Cook coming aboard as principal last year, "I finally got listened to," Hermes said.


   


  Day did not return a phone call left with the superintendent's office Wednesday afternoon. Keeton did not respond for a clarification on remarks Hermes and Cook made.


   


  Earlier, Keeton emailed a board statement to The State Journal-Register confirming that allegations were made against Day, that the investigation was completed by the St. Louis firm and that the board had passed a resolution returning Day as superintendent.


   


  Hermes and Cook said they were not contacted after their resignations.


   


  "It's very disappointing," Hermes said. "I deserved a response or an explanation. It goes to me being more devalued, which is why I have to walk away."


   


  "When you keep someone who has been found to have sexual harassment and ethical misconduct charges found valid, that sends a message," she said. "That's not the message I want for my community, but unfortunately, it's the one I have right now."


   


  Being around school is "without a doubt my heart and soul and passion," said Hermes, who is married with two children. "I received a lot of texts and emails from staff members who are as broken-hearted as I am."


   


  Cook said he and Hermes have both retained legal counsel.


   


  "We have our options open," said Cook, who is married with two children. "I don't know where I go from here. That's not something I'm going to make a decision about when emotions are so high."

The British government is sticking to its strategy of tiered, regional restrictions to combat COVID-19 amid mounting political and scientific pressure for stronger nationwide measures to prevent the coronavirus pandemic from spiraling out of control.
 Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab on Friday reiterated the government’s belief that a regional approach where the toughest restrictions are imposed only in the areas where infection rates are highest is the best way to slow the spread of the virus and protect the economy.
 “I think the right thing, both on public health grounds but also supporting the economy, supporting jobs, livelihoods, supporting our society and the most vulnerable in it, is to avoid a second national lockdown,” Raab told Sky News.
 The government has been under fire since Prime Minister Boris Johnson unveiled his three-tier strategy on Monday amid revelations that scientific advisers had recommended a short nationwide lockdown to slow rapidly rising infection rates. Leaders of  northern cities have refused to accept the tightest restrictions unless the government provides more support to cushion the impact on business and individuals.

Celebrities and influencers are often the target of cyber bullying and trolling, but the latest victim to a long list of names is jewellery brand Tanishq. The retail brand from Titan Company Ltd (Tata Group) finds itself in what can only be described as caught between a rock and a hard place in its attempt to celebrate the "coming together of people from different walks of life."      Ahead of the festive season, traditionally a time when people across the country buy and invest in gold, Tanishq has ruffled feathers for releasing a 45-second advertisement for it's latest collection 'Ekatvam', wherein it tried to showcase "unity in oneness" by depicting a moment between a Hindu daughter- in-law and her Muslim mother-in-law.      The brand has received censure for promoting what some have called "Love Jihad" and these sections have shouted out to viewers to #BoycottTanishq. After the jewellery major pulled the add down for hurting sentiments, it was then called out for giving into cyber bullying and not sticking to it's stand by those who believe that there was absolutely nothing wrong with the video.     


  Tanishq was quick to release a statement on its Twitter handle clarifying, "The idea behind the Ekatvam campaign is to celebrate the coming together of people from different walks of life, local communities and families during these challenging times and celebrate the beauty of oneness. This film has stimulated divergent and severe reactions, contrary to its very objective. We are deeply saddened by the inadvertent stirring of emotions and withdraw this film keeping in mind the hurt sentiments and well being of our employees, partners and store staff."      A series of illustrations have now replaced the add on the company's social media accounts. On the one hand politician Shashi Tharoor has spoken out in favour of the advertisement, while on the other, actress Kangana Ranaut has criticised it.      Advertisement bodies have come out in support of the brand and have demanded action against what they call "intimidating behaviour". The Advertising Club released a statement on behalf of the Indian Media and Advertising Industry strongly "condemning the threatening and targeting of 'Tanishq' and its employees in regards to their latest advertisement", emphasising it breaks no "ethical standards, is not derogatory to any person, organisation or religion and does not hurt any national sentiment." Rejecting a complaint against the advertisement for "promoting communal intermingling", The Advertising Standards Council of India (ASCI) said that there is no violation of any code.

Adds details on hospital bed orders, background)
 PRAGUE, Oct 15 (Reuters) - The Czech Republic will start building capacity for COVID-19 patients outside of hospitals, government officials said on Thursday, as the country battles the fastest rate of infections in Europe.
 Interior Minister Jan Hamacek told CTK news agency the army would start building an area for 500 hospital beds at a fairground in Prague from Saturday.
 Both military and healthcare personnel will staff the makeshift hospital, Hamacek told Czech television.
 COVID-19 infections have nearly doubled in October alone to a total so far of 139,290 in a country with a population of 10.7 million. The Health Ministry reported 9,544 new COVID-19 cases on Wednesday, its highest one-day tally so far.
 Prime Minister Andrej Babis told reporters it was necessary to start building extra capacity and that the state would purchase 4,000 beds from hospital and nursing bed maker LINET.
 "We don't have time, the outlook is not good. These numbers are catastrophic," Babis said.
 Earlier this week, the government shuttered bars, restaurants and clubs and shifted schools to distance learning as it imposed new measures to curb the fast spread of new infections.
 The number of hospitalisations has risen 161% in October to 2,678, with 518 patientes in intensive care. Deaths have climbed to 1,172, up 75% this month.
 The fast rise in cases has put strain on hospitals, which are converting general wards into COVID-19 units and cancelling non-urgent procedures to cope. The number hospitalised is six times the peak seen during the first wave of the virus. (Reporting by Jason Hovet and Michael Kahn; Editing by Richard Pullin, Alex Richardson and Gareth Jones)

Recasts with more Dutch comment, adds more background)
 By Gabrielle Tétrault-Farber and Anthony Deutsch
 MOSCOW/AMSTERDAM, Oct 15 (Reuters) - The Dutch government urged Russia to return to the negotiating table after Moscow said on Thursday it was withdrawing from talks on liability for the downing of flight Malaysia Airlines in 2014.
 Russia's foreign ministry said it was abandoning the discussions with the Netherlands and Australia, saying they were not genuinely interested in establishing the truth about what happened and had launched legal proceedings against it.
 MH17 was flying from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur when it was shot down by a missile fired from territory held by pro-Russian rebels during fighting in eastern Ukraine, international investigators say. All 298 people on board were killed, two-thirds of them Dutch nationals.
 After years of collecting evidence, a Dutch-led international Joint Investigation team (JIT) last year said the missile launcher used to hit the civilian airplane came from a Russian army base just across the border.
 The Netherlands holds Russia responsible and has started legal proceedings at the European Court of Human Rights. It is prosecuting four individuals - three Russians and a Ukrainian -for shooting down the aircraft and killing everyone on board.
 DUTCH DISAPPOINTMENT
 "It is a disappointment and also a surprise," Dutch Foreign Minister Stef Blok said in response to Moscow's decision.
 "It must especially be a disappointment for the relatives to hear that this venue towards truth and justice for now has been blocked."
 "I cannot exclude any actions (against Russia) for now, but first and foremost is my invitation to the Russians to come back to the negotiating table," Blok said.
 The Russian foreign ministry called the Dutch-led investigation into the crash "biased, superficial and politicised".
 "Australia and the Netherlands did not seek to understand what really happened in the summer of 2014, but instead were aiming to get Russia to admit guilt and receive compensation for the victims' relatives," the ministry added.
 The JIT also includes Australia, Belgium and Malaysia, which lost citizens in the disaster, as well as Ukraine. (Reporting by Maxim Rodionov in Moscow and Anthony Deutsch in Amsterdam; Writing by Alexander Marrow and Gabrielle Tétrault-Farber; Editing by Gareth Jones)

“This is where I get bogged down. First off, I cannot see how we can even consider it (reopening) when we're sitting in our kitchens and dining rooms,” said board member Deborah Wingo.
 Wingo pointed out that, although the San Joaquin County is currently reporting weekly positive COVID-19 cases in the low 40s, that is still four times more than the number of weekly reported cases from when schools first stopped face- to-face instruction in March.
 After 45 minutes of deliberation, board member Pete Carlson made the motion to adopt the first option of tentatively returning to on-campus learning on Jan. 4, based on current COVID-19 data and on parents' and teachers' feedback. Carlson also noted that the board should convene in person if they are going to make a decision to reopen schools.
 Board member Brian Jackman seconded the motion, with an amendment that there be further discussion of the possibility of bringing at-risk students struggling with distance learning back on campus earlier.
 “I think we would be doing a disservice to those children if we don't think about some way to assist them during this time,” said Jackman. “We can't just wash our hands of them and say it's the pandemic's fault, and they're the casualties of the state that we're in. We're bigger than that. We're better than that. As humans we are stronger than that.”
 JSD has already brought small cohorts of students that receive most of their services in a specialized setting back for on-campus learning according to the office of the superintendent. The board will leave it up to the discretion of the superintendent and other district staff to come up with a plan to bring students who would benefit from in-person instruction back to campus.

  NEW YORK, Oct 15 (Reuters) - A year ago, Flora Growth Chief Executive Damian Lopez had just spent a chunk of his company's seed capital buying a Colombian cannabis producer, and was fighting his way through the legal and financial hurdles that have made development of the industry such a challenge over the past decade.


  These days, a boom in sales of his hemp-derived health food and beauty products during the coronavirus pandemic, and the prospect of an easing of marijuana laws in the aftermath of the U.S. presidential election, have him sealing a $30 million funding round and making plans for a U.S. public floatation early next year.


  "I think the election will be a huge catalyst," Lopez said on Wednesday. He was busy planning for the initial public offering (IPO) with investment banking firm Boustead Securities set to be the company's chief adviser.


  Lopez is far from alone. U.S.-based dispensary business Gage Cannabis announced two weeks ago it would seek to list in the new year, while synthetic cannabinoid maker BioMedican has also laid out plans to go public in the first half of 2021.


  Another hemp-based health products maker, Vertical Wellness, told Reuters this week it too was looking to debut next year.


  Today's outlook is a far cry from 2018, when many Canadian-based players created for last year's legalization there, as well as expectations of the widespread opening of U.S. markets, faced fines and shutdowns, or were forced to merge, due to regulatory roadblocks that hampered growth prospects.


  Lopez and other CEOs say the potential January arrival in the White House of Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his pro-decriminalization running-mate, Senator Kamala Harris, may prove a watershed moment for the industry.


  But even if President Donald Trump wins a second term, changing views on marijuana laws among voters and lawmakers have brightened the outlook for the industry, CEOs and analysts said.


  "Regardless of who wins, more and more states are showing their support for cannabis," Lopez said.


  Voters in five states, including densely-populated New Jersey and rapidly- growing Arizona, are expected to back measures on Nov. 3 that would allow recreational use of marijuana.


  "We believe the November elections could drive meaningful upside for the U.S. marijuana industry," said Michael Lavery, an analyst at Piper Sandler & Co.


  'DRAMATIC CHANGE IN EXPECTATIONS'


  Shares of companies with broad footprints in the U.S. market, including Curaleaf Holdings Inc, Cresco Labs Ltd and Green Thumb Industries Inc are all up more than 20% since the presidential debate on Sept. 29, mirroring rising expectations of a Biden victory.


  The Democratic nominee has widened his lead in several states likely to decide the election, Reuters polls showed, as well as his lead in online betting markets.


  In last week's debate with Vice President Mike Pence, Harris said marijuana would be decriminalized at a federal level in the United States under a Biden administration.


  "Each election cycle cannabis comes closer to federal acceptance, and this election is pivotal to those goals," said Cynthia Salarizadeh, founder and president of House of Saka, a cannabis-infused beverages business.


  A Democratic victory for control of the Senate, which is looking increasingly likely according to polls, would replace Republican Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who has blocked legislation that would allow cannabis companies greater access to financial markets.


  Cannabis sales have surged with people stuck at home during the coronavirus pandemic. In California, sales data for August showed a 26% jump over the past year, while sales in Nevada were up 34%, according to BDS Analytics.


  Federal decriminalization, or legalization in more states, would not be without specific challenges, investors said.


  Many point to Canada as an example.


  Though the country became the first G-20 nation to legalize recreational use of cannabis in 2018, regulatory hiccups in Canadian dispensary rollouts, slow international legalization and a lack of profitability sent investors packing over the next year. That left most companies at a fraction of their market values by the beginning of this year.


  Michael Underhill, chief investment officer at Capital Innovations, cautioned that several bills would need to pass before U.S. companies will be on the same regulatory playing field as their Canadian counterparts.


  Still, "it's a dramatic change in expectations from three months ago, when it appeared Donald Trump would most likely win re-election," he said. (Reporting by Shariq Khan and David Randall; Editing by Patrick Graham, Ira Iosebashvili and Bill Berkrot)

But the impact has been most devastating in the world of baseball. An astonishing list of Hall of Fame members passed away this calendar year: Detroit Tigers stalwart Al Kaline; overpowering pitcher Tom Seaver; great base stealer Lou Brock; fearsome pitcher Bob Gibson; New York Yankees champion hurler Whitey Ford; and legendary infielder and offensive sparkplug Joe Morgan, a former Phillie.
 Any one of the aforementioned players could have been the subject of an entire tribute of their own. And we haven’t even mentioned some other notable players who passed on this year but aren’t in the Hall of Fame.
 Why do people react with such emotion to the loss of people they never had an opportunity to meet? There’s no denying that nostalgia plays a big role.
 But there’s more to it than that. Athletic endeavors may be insignificant in the grand scheme of things. Yet there’s something inspiring about watching people do extraordinary things thanks to a combination of remarkable God-given talent and a willingness to put forth tremendous work and sacrifice to get the most out of it. And in many cases these athletes had compelling personalities and life stories as well.
 So many of us were impressed by Bryant’s sheer determination to win and seriousness of purpose, and by Thompson’s admirable efforts to bring out the best of his players on and off the court.
 All these years later it’s still thrilling to watch film clips of Sayers breaking into the clear and racing down the field for the Chicago Bears.
 The heartfelt tributes that poured in after Seaver’s death were enough to move people to tears. Fans and fellow players alike celebrated his great accomplishments on the mound and his feat of carrying the New York Mets franchise from laughingstock to champion in a matter of a few years.
 As we anxiously await brighter times, let us learn from the examples of these great athletes and coaches, many of whom accomplished great things in spite of tremendous adversity in and away from the game. And let’s not be ashamed to take joy in sports, past and present, as an escape from today’s troubles. As long as games can be played safely, it’s a welcome diversion in a painful time.

Ralph Hasenhuttl says Southampton will do everything possible to prolong the “unhappy” start to Premier League life for his former player Timo Werner.


  Germany forward Werner is yet to register a top-flight goal in four appearances since joining Chelsea from RB Leipzig for around £47million.


  Saints boss Hasenhuttl, who takes his side to Stamford Bridge on Saturday, signed the 24-year-old for Bundesliga club Leipzig in 2016 and revealed his one-time protege is only satisfied when he finds the net.


  The Austrian believes Chelsea have made a “fantastic signing” but is eager for Werner’s barren run in the league to continue for the time being.


  “I know this player very well. I had two fantastic years with him. We brought him in from Stuttgart for small money, if you want, because we knew the game we played in Leipzig was perfect for him,” said Hasenhuttl.


  “The first year was amazing. He scored massive goals, I think it was 24 in the first season in the Bundesliga and we were vice-champions (runners-up).


  “It was a fantastic year, we both enjoyed it a lot. I have worked with a lot of players in my entire managing career – he is definitely one of the quickest I’ve ever worked with.


  “He is really hard to defend, he has a fantastic finish. In the second year, it delivered more problems with some injuries.


  “He is getting a more complete striker now, a better package. He learned a lot last season and is a fantastic signing for Chelsea.


  “He’s only happy when he scores. Hopefully he’s unhappy after the game – we will do everything to keep him unhappy.”


  Werner was on target in midweek when Germany drew 3-3 with Switzerland in the Nations League and also found the net during Chelsea’s Carabao Cup tie with Tottenham last month.


  He arrived during a busy transfer window for the Blues, which also included the signings of goalkeeper Edouard Mendy, defenders Ben Chilwell and Thiago Silva, midfielder Hakim Ziyech, and compatriot Kai Havertz.


  Hasenhuttl feels Chelsea boss Frank Lampard has recruited an enviable array of talent and admits Saints face a more difficult task than last season when they won 2-0 in west London on Boxing Day having lost the home fixture 4-1.


  “If they wouldn’t be a better team, they would have spent the money for nothing,” he said.


  “Definitely they have to be a better team than last season because with Timo Werner, Kai Havertz and a few other signings they have so much quality now – not only in the attacking positions but mainly there – so normally a team that is prepared to win titles and trophies.


  “And in the end for us more difficult than last season, maybe.


  “We had two different games last season, the first we lost, the second we played fantastically. The level is high. We must reach this level because otherwise it will be difficult to get something.”

LONDON (AP) — The British government is sticking to its strategy of tiered, regional restrictions to combat COVID-19 amid mounting political and scientific pressure for stronger nationwide measures to prevent the pandemic from spiraling out of control. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab on Friday reiterated the government’s belief that a regional approach where the toughest restrictions are imposed only in the areas where infection rates are highest is the best way to slow the spread of the virus and protect the economy. The government has been under fire since Prime Minister Boris Johnson unveiled his three-tier strategy on Monday amid revelations that scientific advisers had recommended a short nationwide lockdown to slow rapidly rising infection rates.

Leaving Galzignano Terme, the riders will enter the Euganean hills, ancient volcanoes that overlook the Padovan-Venetian plain, where there are two fourth-category climbs. The first to Roccolo (averaging 8.3 per cent over 4.1km) comes in two parts, the first rising up the Muro di Vallorta, where the gradient briefly touches 20 per cent, and the second continuing to Roccolo, where there's another abrupt ramp that's almost as steep.


  Leaving Rivadolmo there's a second "wall", this time the Muro di Calaone, which is just a tad under 10 per cent gradient for 2.1 kilometres. Like the Vallorta, it takes a narrow, twisting route through dense woodland and offers the chance for punchy climbers to ambush the sprinters. Cresting this climb, there are 16 kilometres to cover io the finish, initially winding through a series of small villages until, on the approach to Monselice, the road runs straight and wide. This will give the sprinters' teams an opportunity to reel in any riders who have taken flight.


  The run-in is comparatively straightforward, until an extremely sharp left- hand bend 400 metres from the line. The battle to be in the vanguard at this point will be especially fierce, as whichever team secure it will probably win the day.

FALL RIVER - Town nurse Emily Lachance has been administering the flu shot at several drive-thru flu clinics in Swansea and Somerset over the past month. While in Fall River, Tess Curran, director of Health and Human Services is advising residents to see their primary care physicians or visit a flu shot clinic at a local pharmacy or store.


  No matter where, the message this season is clear: Get a flu shot.


  In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, the flu shot is more important than ever, said Curran. While she always encourages everyone over age 6 months to get the flu shot, this year it's of even more significance because COVID can mirror some of the symptoms of the flu, she said.


  "People sometimes belittle the flu, but the flu kills people every year, so it's really important every year to get the flu shot but this year it's critical," added Curran.


  Fall River hasn't held flu shot clinics in years because there's so many other ways to access flu shots in the community and most types of insurance cover the cost them, said Curran.


  The flu season runs from October to May, but Curran is encouraging everyone to get the shot as soon as possible. The precautions people are urged to use to prevent the spread of COVID-19, such as washing hands, wearing masking and avoiding any unnecessary contact outside the home, will also help with limiting the spread of the flu, added Curran.


  In Somerset and Swansea, Lachance will administer 1,300 flu shots over this season. She has already administered 650 flu shots in three clinics and she has another 650 shots available to administer at upcoming flu shot clinics and in her office by appointment. Lachance ordered the shots last spring through her supplier, but she was told they were out of shots now so once the remaining 650 are used up that will be the end of her supply for this season. The next ones will be Oct. 17 and 24. Check the Swansea website to make an appointment.


  She said the huge demand for the flu shot has resulted in delays in shipping, at least from one of the bigger companies. "I did have a few weeks where I had nothing," said Lachance. "I would not be surprised if I run out entirely this year."


  LaChance said she also does in-house clinics in the schools in both towns' schools with the assistance of the Swansea school nurses.


  Somerset Fire Chief Jamison Barros said the Somerset Fire Department has been able to help Lachance with administering the flu shots at the drive-thru flu clinics as a result of the Community EMS Program. Through that program, 33 members of the fire department have been trained to administer vaccines, which will also apply to a vaccine for COVID-19, when its available, he said.


  "Somerset Fire has been and will be a huge help," said Lachance.

As Trump brags about rushing a covid vaccine through testing, record numbers of Americans say they won’t get it. Gee, I wonder why. Will researchers have cut corners that result in dead vaccine recipients? Will scientists have vetted it for other dangerous side effects? Will it even work? These are legitimate questions, even for those of us who are not anti-vaxxers, who in fact believe in the life-saving efficacy of vaccines. New vaccines have rigorous testing protocols for a reason, and one is public trust. But Trump, his eye ever on boosting his sagging electoral prospects, even, for a while, claimed he would bust a vaccine through the approval process before the election. He was in a big rush. He thus appeared to throw serious science out the window. He couldn’t have picked a worse time.

 CABERY -- Bernice A. Canham, 93, Cabery, died at 10:50 p.m., Saturday, Oct. 10, 2020, at the home of her daughter in rural Kempton.
 Her funeral will be at 11 a.m., Wednesday, Oct. 21, at the Cabery United Methodist Church with the Rev. Jane Bradford officiating.
 Burial will be in Mt. Hope Cemetery, Cabery.
 Visitation will be from 4 to 8 p.m., Tuesday, Oct. 20, at Calvert & Martin Funeral Home, Cullom, and from 10 to 11 a.m. at the church on Wednesday.
 Bernice was born July 16, 1927, in Cullom, a daughter of John and Grace Cook Hartman. She married Richard C. Canham Nov. 22, 1947, in Cabery. He died in May of 2009.
 Survivors include three children, Nelson (Susan) Canham, Yukon, Okla., Linda (William) Sanders, Gardner, and Sarah Mercer, Kempton; six grandchildren, Jamie (David) Yelton, Amanda Sanders, Katherine Sanders, Jake Sanders, Josh (Samantha) Mercer and Jessica (Christopher) Stewart; one step-granddaughter, Emily Nova; two great-grandchildren, Charlie Mercer and Georgia Mercer; and one step-great-grandchild, Clayton Stewart.
 She was preceded in death by one son in infancy, Frank Canham; one son-in-law, Steve Mercer; three brothers and one sister.
 Bernice was educated in Cullom schools. She delivered rural route mail from June 1968 through 1990, first in rural Cabery and then, in 1975, in the Gilman area. She loved being a rural route mail carrier, always carrying candy for the little kids who came to the mailbox.
 She was a farmer's wife who drove a team of horses bringing in the crops to cutting hay with the tractor she had to hand crank to start. There was nothing she couldn't do. Her love of horses was one of the many things that she and her husband shared.
 Bernice was a member of the Cabery United Methodist Church and the Women's Club of the church. She enjoyed her paperback western books, her crossword puzzles, watching the birds at her feeders and putting together her jigsaw puzzles.
 She loved her children and supported them in everything they did. She then, in turn, shared that love with her children's children, and her great- grandchildren.
 Bernice never wanted for anything, not because she had everything, but because she had a heart of gold and was happy with what she had.
 The family suggests memorials be made to the Cabery United Methodist Church.

The Raiders held on to a narrow two point lead, wining the set 25-23 on a final kill by Miller.


  The Eagles jumped out to a 7-2 lead in set three, getting four kills from Kamler. The Raiders kept things close with three more kills from Miller and ace serves from sophomore Katelyn Mazour and Miller.


  Eagles sophomore Jess Hudson had a block late in the set to give the Eagles an 18-15 advantage. The Eagles would maintain their lead and win set three 25-20.


  BDS fell behind 7-3 in set one against the Storm in the second match of the day. Behind the play of Bolte and Kamler, who combined for nine kills in the set, the Eagles took a 25-22 first set victory.


  “Our seniors have been really great all year, they have a lot of heart and they really want to win,” said Alfs. “They want to get back to Lincoln and they want to end on a good note. I appreciate the seniors for being such great leaders and they really lift up the younger girls. They always seem to rise to the occasion and when we need them, they are ready.”


  The Eagles had no problem in set two, taking a 16-2 lead and winning 25-14.


  “After that first match I felt really good, when you can steal a set from a team like BDS, it’s always great,” said Lay. “I was hoping that would give us a lot of confidence heading into the second game, but we just didn’t play like well against High Plains. We just have to figure out how to play our game all of the time.”


  The Raiders battled in set one against the Storm but fell 19-25 in set one and 13-25 in set two.


  “Tonight didn’t end like we wanted to but we’ve improved so much and we’re excited going into post season because we see our potential and we know we can get where we want to be,” said Lay.

New throughout, adds comments from McConnell and McCarthy)
 By Lisa Lambert and Andrea Shalal
 WASHINGTON, Oct 15 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Thursday said he is willing to raise his offer of $1.8 trillion for a COVID-19 relief deal with Democrats in the U.S. Congress, but the idea was shot down by his fellow Republican, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.
 The White House proposed the $1.8 trillion in stimulus last week in negotiations with House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Pelosi, the top Democrat in Congress, rejected the offer and has stuck to her demand for a $2.2 trillion deal. The talks appear unlikely to produce an agreement before the Nov. 3 election.
 Trump, who is running against Democratic challenger Joe Biden, told Fox Business Network he has directed Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to put forward a bigger stimulus offer, with additional money to help U.S. workers. Pelosi and Mnuchin were expected to speak again on Thursday.
 "We like stimulus, we want stimulus and we think we should have stimulus," Trump said.
 The president ruled out accepting Pelosi's proposal outright "because she's asking for all sorts of goodies."
 McConnell, the top Republican in Congress, noted that a higher amount was under discussion. But he said nearly all Senate Republicans favor a much smaller $500 billion aid bill in response to the pandemic that has killed nearly 217,000 Americans and damaged the economy.
 "My members think what we laid out – a half a trillion dollars, highly targeted – is the best way to go. So that's what I'm going to put on the floor," McConnell said during an appearance in Henderson, Kentucky.
 The Senate bill, which is expected to come to a vote next week, has money for small businesses, aid to schools, liability protection for businesses, unemployment benefits and assistance to hospitals. Democrats have already rejected a similar measure.
 Many economists as well as Federal Reserve officials have pushed for another stimulus to blunt the economic pain of the coronavirus pandemic, which has put millions of Americans out of work.
 U.S. stocks have slumped in the past couple of days on signs the talks had reached an impasse.
 Many Republicans, especially in the Senate, already view the White House's current $1.8 trillion offer as too big. Republicans voiced those concerns in a weekend call with administration officials.
 At a news conference Thursday, House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy sidestepped questions about whether he would support a $1.8 trillion package, or go even bigger. McCarthy said $1.8 trillion was "a very big deal," but added: "It doesn't matter what our answer would be, because the Speaker has denied anything from moving."
 He said he does not expect agreement on a fresh coronavirus relief package before Election Day as long as Pelosi is involved in negotiations.
 Mnuchin said he would not allow differences with Pelosi over a national strategy for COVID-19 testing and tracing to stand in the way of an agreement.
 "I'm going to tell her that we're not going to let the testing issue stand in the way, that we'll fundamentally agree with their testing language subject to some minor issues. This issue is being overblown," Mnuchin said in an interview with CNBC.
 Mnuchin also clarified his remarks a day earlier that reaching an agreement would be difficult before the election.
 "What I said was that a deal would be hard to get done before the election but we're going to keep trying, so I don't want to say that it's not likely. It's just there are significant issues."

Denver Broncos running back Melvin Gordon was back at practice Thursday after his arrest for DUI earlier in the week.


  The team sent Gordon home from practice Wednesday while it investigated. Broncos coach Vic Fangio wouldn't commit to Gordon playing this week against the New England Patriots.


  Gordon was charged late Tuesday night with driving under the influence and speeding in downtown Denver. He allegedly was driving 71 mph in 35 a mph zone, according to a police report obtained by 9News Denver.


  Gordon is scheduled for a Nov. 13 court date, per court records.


  Gordon, 27, could be in line for a three-game suspension from the NFL. Gordon could also lose his guaranteed money for 2021, 9News reported, citing language in Gordon's contract.


  Signed to a two-year, $16 million deal this offseason, Gordon leads the Broncos in carries (65), yards rushing (281) and rushing touchdowns (three). The two-time Pro Bowl selection also has 11 catches for 45 yards and a score.


  Gordon has rushed for 4,521 yards and 39 touchdowns and added 235 catches for 1,918 yards with 12 scores in 71 career games with the San Diego/Los Angeles Chargers (2015-19) and Broncos.

“Yes, absolutely. For one thing, president is not the only race on the ballot,” Mark Smith, professor and chair of the political science department, said. “There are other statewide elections. There are initiatives and referenda. Voting is also expressive. It's about you indicating ... what you want to happen; you identifying with social groups or with a political party.”


  The panel was the second of a three-part series, “Election 2020: A Turning Point?” hosted by the department.


  Smith’s portion of the panel covered polls and the Electoral College, hammering home the concept of the Electoral College advantage — the circumstances that allow a candidate who loses the popular vote to win the race nonetheless — and the importance of Pennsylvania as the likely tipping- point state in this year’s presidential election.


  A “tipping-point state” is the state in the general election that pushes a candidate to victory. In three of the past six elections — 1996, 2012, and 2016 — this was Pennsylvania, and all signs point to this likely being the case again this year. In September, FiveThirtyEight gave Joe Biden a 96% chance of winning the election if he takes Pennsylvania. If President Donald Trump were to win the state, the analysis gave him an 84% chance of getting reelected.


  Trump carried the state by 44,292 votes in 2016, but FiveThirtyEight’s forecast currently has Biden up by seven points in the state.


  Smith did end his speaking portion with a caveat.

The government has not formally updated its official decarbonisation strategy since 2017, which was adopted before the UK increased its long term emissions target from 80 per cent cuts by 2050 to net zero. As such, the government has faced growing criticism in recent months, with green groups warning the country is not on track to meet either its medium or long term emissions targets. Frustrations have mounted further over the government's failure to publish a raft of climate-related policy documents that remain in the pipeline, such as the Energy White Paper, National Infrastructure Strategy, and promised 10 point 'green recovery' plan, ro name but a few.

When Joe Biden picked Kamala Harris as his running mate back a couple of months ago, it was historic.


  Third woman, first “woman of color” as we keep being reminded, first “child born of immigrants,” Harris was impressive if only because of her novelty. And some felt that she was impressive because of a lot of other factors, including her intelligence and resume.


  I DVR’d last week’s vice presidential debate featuring Harris and Vice President Mike Pence so I could give it the attention it deserved, which translates into “freeze framing and rewinding” those moments of particular interest.


  I had heard about the fly on Pence’s head, and wanted to see the little squatter for myself. I had heard about the eye rolling and grimaces from Harris and her almost “I’m With Stupid” mannerisms when the current vice president was talking. I already had experience with her whiny, nasal delivery, and as an aside, am considering elective ear drum removal if she does become veep.


  And I had also heard about how each candidate had expertly and consistently deflected questions like “will you support packing the Supreme Court” and “is climate change real?”


  Everything I’d heard was confirmed by the DVR. Pence hit some birdies, and Harris made some cogent points.


  But I had also heard that Harris was disrespected by Pence when he spoke over her or exceeded his time limits, and was astounded by the novel theory that she wasn’t as aggressive as she might have been because she didn’t want to come off looking like an “angry black woman.”


  That was news to me, because while she didn’t look angry, she did look bemused, patronizing, supercilious and impatient in her smirking glory. The mere suggestion that she was reigning in her true nature is a little rich, because I think we all had an opportunity to see that nature on full, Technicolor display.


  And guess what? That’s fine. Our president is a nasty little fellow when he wants to cut someone down, and has used insults and brutishness to make his points. Any supporter who denies that, or justifies that, is living in the Magic Kingdom. A lot of men emulate his attitude, and a lot of women, too. Nancy Pelosi has perfected the art of being offensive, and that’s equally fine. Politicians are not noted for their chivalry, decorum and downright decency these days.


  But I am a little sick and tired of people trying to make excuses for Harris by saying that her mediocre debate performance (and Pence was by far the better debater, which was expected) was due to her fear of being viewed as a nasty woman.


  In other words, she toned it down because she knew that some critics would use misogynistic tropes to pan her “aggressiveness.”


  I actually don’t think Harris felt that way. It’s her supporters, the same ones who defamed and slandered Sarah Palin, Christine O’Donnell, Michelle Bachman, Martha McSally, and most recently, Amy Coney Barrett, who are hypersensitive to any suggestion of being mean to a woman. That is laughable, if you think about their motley track record with women they don’t like.


  After seeing how the wagons were circled around her after what really was a C+ to B- performance in the debate, I have to wonder if progressives aren’t guilty of the bigotry of “low expectations” when it comes to the women they like.


  Pointing out that she was rude, evasive, and not all that well-informed on the principles of religious liberty (she has yet to apologize to Catholics for that Knights of Columbus “cult” slander) is not misogyny.


  To paraphrase the president, it is what it is.

Appointing all seven members of the court, as Baker is poised to do, would be a historic accomplishment for a Massachusetts governor. Legal experts say the only other time in the state's history that has happened was when John Hancock was elected governor in the late 1780s.


  "This is a really huge deal," said Eileen Duff, a Gloucester Democrat and member of the Governor's Council, which reviews Baker's nominees. "It's a daunting task for the governor, and I don't think he's taking it lightly."


  New applicants for the high court, who remain unknown, will first be vetted by the Judicial Nominating Commission, which operates under Baker's office.


  Eventually, the nominees would go before the eight-member Governor’s Council, which has final say on confirmations.


  Governor's Councilor Terrence Kennedy, a Democrat and Everett lawyer, said he has no idea who Baker plans to nominate for either post but hopes he will expand the diversity of the court. Justice Kimberly Budd, a Black woman appointed by Baker in 2016, is the only person of color on the bench.


  "In this day and age, with all the racial justice issues the courts are wrestling with, we should have an African-American man on the SJC," Kennedy said.


  Duff, too, said she wants to see more diversity on the high court.


  "I'm not just talking about a court that reflects the diversity of the state, but the diversity of the people who are appearing in courtrooms," she said. "And that is not typically an educated white male."


  She thinks Baker should also look outside the court system, such as academia, for potential candidates.

Anthologies are always a mixed sweet-box. While you relish some with your eyes closed, you also question some of them for finding a place in the box. Puthum Pudhu Kaalai is a unique project wherein the shorts are made by well-known directors around the theme of hope. The title itself is a refreshing one, which tells you that there’s something to look forward to despite the panoramic panic surrounding the pandemic, especially the 21-day lockdown. The fact that a few features and anthologies have already been written, shot, edited, and released since March this year should serve as a positive sign for the industry.All the five shorts in this omnibus brim with optimism. Perhaps, that’s what Amazon Prime Video wanted – films that feel good at the end of the day and not rattle the viewers’ hearts much.Ilamai Idho IdhoI was surprised to discover Sudha Kongara’s short right at the opening, and immediately took a liking to it. Jayaram plays a middle-aged guy who’s too excited for some reason. He can’t seem to contain his joy and it shows on his face – it’s the face of a little kid who’s waiting for the guests to leave so that he can dig into the goodies they brought. And you soon learn that he’s getting ready to receive his girlfriend (played by Urvashi). It’s not a big tale of twists or a comedy of errors. Rather it’s a simple story of how love makes people feel young. And there’s another couple, too, in the short, played by Jayaram’s son, Kalidas, and Kalyani Priyadarshan.All the cast members must have had fun while shooting because it’s evident. The way the characters played by Jayaram and Urvashi bicker about their lifestyle choices is silly and yet hilarious. They have been working together since the '80s and it’s great to watch them bring freshness to the table without banking on the nostalgia factor alone. Kalyani and Kalidas, on the other hand, really complement the older pair and I hope they team up for a full-length romantic comedy in future.Avarum Naanum - Avalum NaanumI had no clue as to who had directed this short till I reached the end credits. It’s unlike any Gautham Menon film I have watched so far. There’s a tinge of sombreness in it that I could not empathise with. M. S. Bhaskar slips into the role of a scientist and Ritu Varma casually walks in as his granddaughter to take care of him. It’s March and the country is under lockdown, so the family members believe that there needs to be somebody in the old man’s house.Again, there’s a new beginning for the characters here. They both appreciate the presence of one another, but the basic problem here is that the short is written (by Reshma Ghatala) in such a way where the history of their strained relationship is put into words and tears. There are places where the grandpa cries at the drop of a hat and it feels manipulative. It’s as though Ghatala couldn’t comprehend the nitty gritties of the short-film format. And, as a result, it left me sighing and grunting a bit.Honest Review of Ishaan Khatter, Ananya Panday's 'Khaali Peeli'Coffee, Anyone?Nowhere else would you be able to see such a casting coup, for the three cousins from the Hasan / Haasan family come together as sisters – Suhasini Mani Ratnam (as Valli), Anu Hasan (as Saras), and Shruti Haasan (as Ramya). This short also suffers from the same problem as Avarum Naanum - Avalum Naanum. Writers Mani Ratnam and Suhasini stuff too much information into the film. Saras, the middle sister, rambles on about how their mother is going to be in the hospital for her seventy-fifth birthday. And, in the same breath, discusses Ramya’s situation with her older sister, Valli.Ramya, the youngest of the lost, has cut off ties with her parents. Her indifference towards her folks stems from an unhealed scar and, though, it’s relevant to the plot, it sounds pompous. The info-dump doesn’t just end there since Valli and Saras, too, have their own share of worries and they’re all spoken about in Coffee, Anyone? If Gautham Menon and Suhasini (the director of this short) had stuck to narrating merely the ups and downs of the everyday routine during the first phase of the lockdown and not dived deep into the interior lives of their characters, maybe their films would have shined better.ReunionReunion, like Ilamai Idho Idho, is another lively short where the pieces fit perfectly. Whether it’s Sadhana (Andrea Jeremiah) singing an A. R. Rahman song, or her friend, Vikram (Gurucharan C.), silently admiring her from afar, there’s mirth in the writing and in the bond that the two school friends share. This is where Rajiv Menon’s film works like a charm. The director focuses on the history of their friendship to build some level of camaraderie in the present. But look at how he balances those aspects – he doesn’t spend too much time on the past equations.Of course, there’s also Bhairavi Aunty (Leela Samson, as Vikram’s mother) in the house. By the time you come to Reunion, you kind of sense the different directions the short is going to take since all of them are centred on the same topic, but Rajiv Menon keeps pushing the bar. And the actors collectively put their best foot forward as they make their actions believable. You can’t help but smile and wonder about Leela Samson’s prowess when she’s at the height of her powers.MiracleMiracle is the only short that doesn’t deal with the men, or the women, of the upper middle-class. While the other shorts featured luxurious homes and vast empty spaces, this Karthik Subbaraj film takes you to the small house of two small-time thieves (played by Bobby Simha and Sharath Ravi). They’re hungry and unhappy about their circumstances, yet they feel there’s hope around the corner. One character takes inspiration from a television guru who keeps saying miracles happen. So, they’re pretty sure about hitting a jackpot, by hook or by crook.Miracle is the funniest and the most twisted short and this is exactly what the format is meant for – giving just about a glimpse into the characters’ lives. Putham Pudhu Kaalai, unlike last year’s Kannada anthology Katha Sangama, isn’t made up of hugely varying narratives. Nevertheless, it’s watchable and pretty enjoyable!

The Supreme Court on Friday, 16 October, appointed Justice (Retd) Madan B Lokur, a former judge of the apex court, to act as a one-man monitoring committee to prevent stubble burning in states of Punjab, Haryana, and Uttar Pradesh that leads to air pollution in Delhi.The Lokur panel shall submit its report fortnightly to the apex court, the SC said, reported news agency PTI.The decision comes in light of winter approaching and concerns once again arising of the usual – smog choking the capital city. There is certainly an urgent need to deal with the issue of stubble burning by farmers in nearby states. Keeping this in mind, the National Cadet Corps, the National Service Scheme and Bharat Scouts will be deployed for assisting panel in monitoring stubble burning in Punjab, Haryana and UP, PTI further reported.But can this issue even be resolved, and what can the government do to curb it? We dive into some of these basic questions.Stubble burning is, quite simply, the act of removing paddy crop residue from the field to sow wheat. It’s usually required in areas that use the ‘combine harvesting’ method which leaves crop residue behind. Now, what is combine harvesting?Combines are machines that harvest, thresh i.e separate the grain, and also clean the separated grain, all at once. The problem, however, is that the machine doesn’t cut close enough to the ground, leaving stubble behind that the farmer has no use for. There is pressure on the farmer to sow the next crop in time for it to achieve a full yield. The quickest and cheapest solution, therefore, is to clear the field by burning the stubble.Not really, but it is the easiest and cheapest method available to farmers as of now. But the situation isn’t so grim after all. There are other options we can look at.The most efficient technology to counter crop burning at the moment, seems to be the Turbo Happy Seeder (THS). The THS is basically a machine mounted on a tractor that not only cuts and uproots the stubble, but can also drill wheat seeds on the soil that has just been cleared up. The straw is simultaneously thrown over the sown seeds to form a mulch cover.The THS can also be fitted with the Super-Straw Management System (S-SMS) that spreads the straw evenly.Ideally, we should. Traditionally, crop residue had a lot of benefits like thatching, or making beds for livestock and cattle. However, growing technology has found more efficient alternatives to this.“The first step to curb crop burning is to find uses for the stubble,” said Anumita Roychowdhury of Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) to Down To Earth.One option is to produce biomass with the residue to generate power. The straw can similarly be used to make pellets that serve as the sub-strata for mushroom cultivation, but the problem is not in finding alternatives to paddy straw, as there are many.The real issue is who cuts and collects the crop residue, and then takes responsibility for transporting them? As of now, the farmer has no incentive to take the pains of extracting crop residue from the earth, Down To Earth reports.The THS costs approximately Rs 1.3 lakh and the S-SMS is about Rs 1.2 lakh. Then there is the cost of the combine, which is upwards of Rs 18 lakh, but the farmer does not have to own them. Just as combines are, these machines can also be used on a custom-hiring basis.Other alternatives, like residue incorporation costs 20 percent more than simply burning the stubble, while fully removing the residue costs 34 percent more than burning, according to Express Tribune. So where is the incentive for the farmer not to resort to the easiest option?India relies on its northern states of Punjab, Haryana, western Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand for wheat.Now, states in the south use combine harvesting too. But the clinching difference is that they don’t have the urgency to remove the stubble to make it ready for the next crop.To sow wheat right after paddy, the field has to be harvested and readied for the next crop. In the Punjab- Haryana-UP belt, the crucial time for the wheat crop to mature is in mid- April, when the temperature is about to cross 35 degree celsius. For the wheat crop to reach full maturity and give maximum yield by then, the farmer has no option but to sow the crop latest by 15 November, so that it grows for a full 140-150 day duration.Add to this complication the Punjab Preservation of Subsoil Water Act 2009 – Punjab’s water-saving law – which bans sowing of paddy before 15 May and transplanting it before 15 June. This leaves the farmer with very little time to sow and reap paddy, and then ready the field for wheat in just about 20 days.Yes, that is simple math, but given that rice is a lucrative crop, how do we go about doing this? The answer is to give incentive to farmers to grow other crops.The Centre and state governments could adopt methods to incentivise farmers, rather than penalising them. If production of other crops, like maize, are made more lucrative, then farmers will switch to growing those.Ajay Vir Jakhar, chairman of the Punjab State Farmers’ Commission in an article for The Print, suggests that the government allow production of ethanol from maize. Then paddy farmers have a reason to switch to maize, or at least devote half of their time to cultivating maize.Clearly farmers have little choice but to burn the stubble, given the pressure under which they have to sow the next crop.The National Green Tribune recommends penalising farmers who burn stubble. Punjab has attempted this, but to no avail. Stubble burning continues, and disgruntled farmers – who are already under debt – refuse to pay fines in the state. Up till the April-May wheat harvesting season this year, farmers in Punjab owed the Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) fines up to Rs 61.32 lakh. Of this, only Rs 18 lakh was recovered, the Indian Express reported. Now, another harvest season is upon us, but not much seems to have changed.So is simply banning stubble burning the answer? Or do we need to offer farmers alternatives? Without a doubt, the answer is the latter.(This piece was first published in November 2017 and has been reposted by The Quint from its archives in light of the Supreme Court appointing a one-man monitoring committee to prevent stubble burning in the states of Punjab, Haryana, and Uttar Pradesh.)

COPENHAGEN/STOCKHOLM, Oct 15 (Reuters) - North Korea said on Thursday a Danish documentary that with hidden cameras shows apparent attempts to evade a U.N. ban on arms trading with Pyongyang was completely made up and called on Denmark to find the infiltrator.


  The documentary "is from the beginning to the end a fabricated film which aimed to cast a slur on the image of the DPRK," the North Korean Embassy in Stockholm said in a letter sent to Danish newspaper Ekstra Bladet, using the country's official acronym.


  When contacted by Reuters, an official at the embassy declined comment, referring only to the letter sent to Ekstra Bladet.


  "The Mole", by maverick filmmaker Mads Bruegger, charts what he said was a 10-year undercover operation by a retired Danish chef to infiltrate a network of sanctions-breakers linked to the head of the Korean Friendship Association (KFA), an international group that promotes friendly ties with Pyongyang.


  In the documentary, the former chef, Ulrich Larsen, pretends to be a supporter of North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un and joins the Friendship Association, becoming a trusted member.


  The film then shows him hiring a former French Foreign Legion soldier to play an arms trader and the two travelling to North Korea for meetings about possible arms deals, apparently winning the trust of North Korean officials.


  No deals were consummated before the undercover operation ended. After the documentary was aired on Sunday evening, Bruegger said he was keen to show to interested authorities "an enormous" amount of material not included in the film.


  The foreign ministers of Sweden and Denmark said they would raise the issue of sanctions busting at the United Nations and European Union.


  The North Korean letter said the embassy was "outraged" by footage in the documentary that shows an embassy official appearing to get involved in illegal activities.


  A release of the full recording of the meeting will make it "crystal clear who is telling lies," the letter said, urging Danish authorities to "solve this issue".


  "(Larsen) is completely out of reach and has disappeared but he must be in Scandinavia or somewhere in Europe and it will be easy for Danish authorities to find him," the letter added.


  The head of the Korean Friendship Association also denied any involvement in alleged sanctions-busting.

Even though it’s only a few weeks away, I am hesitant to call the election. Biden has a huge lead in the polls but Trump has an ace in the hole: an unprecedented volume of mail-in ballots due to the COVID pandemic, which will run predominantly Democratic and provide attractive targets for Republican attorneys to drag out state vote counts past the December 14th electoral college certification deadline, which would trigger the obscure 12th Amendment scenario in which 50 states each get one vote for president in the next House of Representatives, in which case Trump wins even if Biden wins the popular vote by a lot.

 DAKAR, Oct 15 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - The World Health Organization (WHO) said on Thursday it was setting up a seven-person independent commission to investigate claims of sexual exploitation and abuse by aid workers during the recent Ebola outbreak in Democratic Republic of Congo.
 In an investigation published last month by the Thomson Reuters Foundation and The New Humanitarian, more than 50 women accused aid workers from the WHO and leading charities of demanding sex in exchange for jobs during the 2018-2020 crisis.
 Five out of seven of the organisations named in the expose have pledged to investigate, as has Congo's health ministry.
 Leading the WHO inquiry will be Aichatou Mindaoudou, former minister of foreign affairs and of social development of Niger, and Julienne Lusenge, a Congolese human rights activist, the U.N. agency said in a statement.
 Lusenge is known for her work advocating for victims of sexual violence in eastern Congo and co-founded the Congolese women's rights group SOFEPADI, which supports survivors.
 Mindaoudou has been a U.N. special representative to Ivory Coast and to Darfur since working for the government of Niger.
 The two co-chairs will choose up to five other people with expertise in sexual exploitation and abuse, emergency response, and investigations to join the commission, the WHO said.
 "The role of the Independent Commission will be to swiftly establish the facts, identify and support survivors, ensure that any ongoing abuse has stopped, and hold perpetrators to account," said WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus in a briefing to member states.
 The commission will be supported by a Secretariat based at WHO, which will also hire an independent and external organisation with experience in similar inquiries.
 About 30 women in the almost year-long Congo investigation accused men who had claimed to work for the WHO. The agency has said it was "outraged" to hear of the reports and reiterated a zero tolerance policy against sexual exploitation.
 The expose came after years of pledges by the United Nations and NGOs to ramp up efforts to end sexual abuse by workers.
 Many women in the Congo said they had not known about helplines and other complaint services set up for complaints. Others said they did not report the abuse for fear of reprisals or losing their jobs. Most said they were too ashamed.
 Some sexual abuse experts applauded the WHO decision to form an independent commission rather than investigate themselves.
 "I'm really happy that they've agreed to that," said Yasmin Sooka, a South African human rights lawyer who was part of an independent panel that investigated allegations of sexual abuse by French troops in Central African Republic.
 The success of the commission will still depend on whether it is given sufficient resources and free rein, she added.
 But Paula Donovan, co-director of the Code Blue Campaign which seeks accountability for abuses by U.N. personnel, said a truly independent investigation would need to be led by U.N. member states, not commissioned and supported by the WHO.
 "I think the word 'independent' is being grossly misused," she said. "It's the fox watching the hen house once again."

Kolkata's Runa Saha has emerged as the first contestant in Kaun Banega Crorepati's history to reach the hot seat without playing fastest fingers first. Runa, who started playing the game on Thursday's episode, has been trying for KBC ever since the show started, but in vain. Her numerous attempts made her a butt of jokes and the 43-year-old didn't even disclose that she had made it to the prelim stages of the show to her family till her interview happened.
 On Thursday, she was the last contestant left after host Amitabh Bachchan started the game with three participants. She started crying when she didn't make to the hot seat. Seeing her getting emotional, Big B called her to the hot seat. She broke down once she was seated and had to be consoled by the host as well as her daughter and husband.


 Amitabh told her that the time to cry was past and offered her a tissue. She told the actor that she had decided that if she failed to make it to the hot seat, she would never watch TV again or pray to God.
 A homemaker-turned-entrepreneur, she said she started a business to sell saris after her husband told her to earn money if she wants to donate it. Married at an early age, she was driven by the ambition to make something of herself.
 On the episode, Amitabh also revealed that he has been contributing with household chores during lockdown. In an interaction with expert advisor Richa Anirudh, he said he participated in household chores during the lockdown and continues to do so. "Bilkul. Sab kaam kiya maine. Jhaadu pochha. Khaana humko pakana nahi aata. Aaj tak kar rahe wo. Seriously bol raha hun main (Absolutely. I did everything. Jhaadu pochha. I can't cook. I still am doing. I am saying this seriously)."

CABERY -- Bernice A. Canham, 93, Cabery, died at 10:50 p.m., Saturday, Oct. 10, 2020, at the home of her daughter in rural Kempton.
   
 Her funeral will be at 11 a.m., Wednesday, Oct. 21, at the Cabery United Methodist Church with the Rev. Jane Bradford officiating.
   
 Burial will be in Mt. Hope Cemetery, Cabery.
   
 Visitation will be from 4 to 8 p.m., Tuesday, Oct. 20, at Calvert & Martin Funeral Home, Cullom, and from 10 to 11 a.m. at the church on Wednesday.
   
 Bernice was born July 16, 1927, in Cullom, a daughter of John and Grace Cook Hartman. She married Richard C. Canham Nov. 22, 1947, in Cabery. He died in May of 2009.
   
 Survivors include three children, Nelson (Susan) Canham, Yukon, Okla., Linda (William) Sanders, Gardner, and Sarah Mercer, Kempton; six grandchildren, Jamie (David) Yelton, Amanda Sanders, Katherine Sanders, Jake Sanders, Josh (Samantha) Mercer and Jessica (Christopher) Stewart; one step-granddaughter, Emily Nova; two great-grandchildren, Charlie Mercer and Georgia Mercer; and one step-great-grandchild, Clayton Stewart.
   
 She was preceded in death by one son in infancy, Frank Canham; one son-in-law, Steve Mercer; three brothers and one sister.
   
 Bernice was educated in Cullom schools. She delivered rural route mail from June 1968 through 1990, first in rural Cabery and then, in 1975, in the Gilman area. She loved being a rural route mail carrier, always carrying candy for the little kids who came to the mailbox.
   
 She was a farmer's wife who drove a team of horses bringing in the crops to cutting hay with the tractor she had to hand crank to start. There was nothing she couldn't do. Her love of horses was one of the many things that she and her husband shared.
   
 Bernice was a member of the Cabery United Methodist Church and the Women's Club of the church. She enjoyed her paperback western books, her crossword puzzles, watching the birds at her feeders and putting together her jigsaw puzzles.
   
 She loved her children and supported them in everything they did. She then, in turn, shared that love with her children's children, and her great- grandchildren.
   
 Bernice never wanted for anything, not because she had everything, but because she had a heart of gold and was happy with what she had.
   
 The family suggests memorials be made to the Cabery United Methodist Church.

Friday is the new start date for the Division II district tennis tournament at Port Clinton and the area has a few representatives as Bryan will have Kaitlyn Posey competing in singles and two doubles teams in Emilee Bassett and Reese Grothaus, plus Brooke Taylor and Haylee Wheeler, competing. Archbold’s Sophie Schramm will will be in singles action as well.


  “The fact that we advanced five girls to districts is really a testament to how hard our girls worked all season,” said Bryan girls tennis coach Mitchell Owens. “We are going to be facing higher seeds across the board heading into the first round so we are going to have to bring the same intensity we showed at Sectionals.”


  In singles action, Posey, who comes in as the fourth seed from the Ottawa Hills sectional, will face off against Lima Shawnee’s Kunmi Ojo, who was the sectional champion at the Elida sectional.


  “Our singles player faces a solid number one seed from Lima Shawnee but again, I think we can be competitive,” said Owens. “So much of it is mindset and we are really focusing on establishing the right mindset going into each match.”


  Schramm finished as the third seed at the Ottawa Hills sectional and will face the runner-up from Elida in Grace Lott from Van Wert.


  Both doubles teams from Bryan will open against familiar competition. Bassett and Grothaus, who beat their teammates in Taylor and Wheeler to be the third seed from Ottawa Hills, will take on Lauren Metcalf and Erin Bleile from Norwalk. Taylor and Wheeler will also see a duo from Norwalk in Emma Trost and Alexa Moore.


  The teams did face off on the court when Bryan and Norwalk met earlier in the year at the state team tournament. Bliele and Metcalf scored a 6-4, 6-3 win over Wheeler and Taylor.


  Winning points early is the key, according to the Bryan coach.


  “When it comes down to it, you have to step out on the court and go out and win points,” said Owens. “At this level, no one is going to give you anything. You have to go out and earn it.”


  Early-round action will be Friday with the semifinals and finals set for Saturday at Port Clinton.

We raise our flag, free our lands and we will go all the way to the end - President Aliyev


--DocBreak--
By Koh Gui Qing and Huw Jones


  NEW YORK/LONDON, Oct 15 (Reuters) - Global shares dropped on Thursday as investors shied from risk and sought safe-havens such as the U.S. dollar on fears that a resurgence in coronavirus cases and a lack of more U.S. fiscal stimulus would hobble the world economy.


  An unexpected rise in U.S. weekly jobless claims figures added to worries that the U.S. economy may sputter if government does not act soon to shore up growth, especially in the face of a spike in COVID-19 cases in Europe.


  The run of negative news dragged on European shares, which were on course for their worst day in 3-1/2 weeks.


  An offer by U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday to raise the size of a U.S. fiscal stimulus package to win the support of Republicans and Democrats helped to narrow losses in equity markets, though many investors still believe a deal is not possible before the Nov. 3 election.


  The S&P 500 fell 17 points, or 0.5%, to 3,472.06, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 59 points, or 0.2%, to 28,452.89. The Nasdaq Composite lost 119 points, or 1%, to 11,648.74.


  "Virus restrictions across Europe continue to sour sentiment," wrote Win Thin and Ilan Solot, currency strategists at BBH Global Currency Strategy, adding that a U.S. fiscal stimulus package is "deader than Elvis."


  "Now, the U.S. economy goes into the winter months without much-needed fiscal stimulus," they wrote in a note.


  The pan-European STOXX 600 skidded 2.1% to a near two-week low, marking its biggest one-day fall in almost -1/2 weeks. London's FTSE 100 fell 1.7% to a near two-week low as worries about the pandemic and uncertainty around a Brexit trade deal spurred investors to book profits.


  MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares lost 1.3% with Hong Kong and India both down over 2% and Japan's Nikkei closing down 0.5%.


  Underlining concerns about the health of the world economy, data showed on Thursday China's factory gate prices fell at a faster-than-expected rate in September while consumer inflation slowed to its weakest pace in 19 months.


  The shift toward safety helped the U.S. dollar, a traditional safe-haven asset. The greenback jumped 0.4% against a basket of six major currencies to 93.809.


  A firmer dollar dragged on sterling, already hammered by concerns about the obstacles that keep the European Union and Britain from reaching a trade deal by Dec. 31. The pound slumped 0.9% to $1.2896.


  The euro drooped 0.4% against the dollar to $1.1694, barely budging on comments by European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde that the ECB was ready to ease policy further if needed.


  Traders' preference for safety helped government bonds. Germany's government bonds rallied to leave their yields at their lowest level since the March spread of COVID-19 caused a global meltdown in stock markets and other riskier assets.


  Gold reversed earlier losses to trade in the black, helped in part by Trump's comments that he was keen on more U.S. fiscal stimulus before the November election. Spot gold edged up 0.3% to $1,906.56 per ounce.


  Oil prices, however, were weighed by concerns about the coronavirus and its impact on the world economy, though losses narrowed compared to earlier in the day.


  Brent crude futures dropped 0.6% to $43.07 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures fell 0.4% to $40.89 a barrel.

Bloomberg) -- Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund ADQ is exploring a potential acquisition of Bausch Health Cos.’s Egyptian drug unit, people with knowledge of the matter said.
 ADQ has been evaluating the Bausch business, known as Amoun Pharmaceutical Co., as it seeks to expand its portfolio of health-care investments, according to the people. Amoun could fetch at least $700 million in a sale, the people said, asking not to be identified because the information is private.
 No final agreements have been reached, and there’s no certainty the deliberations will lead to a transaction, the people said. Amoun could also attract other suitors, according to the people. Representatives for ADQ and Amoun couldn’t immediately comment. A spokesperson for Bausch declined to comment.
 Bausch, formerly known as Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc., has been reshaping its operations since becoming infamous on Wall Street for raising drug prices. One activist investor, Glenview Capital, has been pushing Bausch to sell or spin off more businesses. The company said in August it would separate its eye-care unit into an independent publicly-traded company.
 Deal Spree
 ADQ owns major enterprises spanning key sectors of the Gulf emirate’s economy, including Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange and Abu Dhabi Airports. It has recently been snapping up assets in industries ranging from food to energy.
 The fund, chaired by Sheikh Tahnoon Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, is in talks to acquire a stake in agricultural trader Louis Dreyfus Co., Bloomberg News reported last month. ADQ and another investor agreed this week to buy a $2.1 billion indirect stake in Abu Dhabi National Oil Co.’s natural gas pipelines.
 Valeant agreed in 2015 to acquire Amoun for about $800 million plus contingency payments as it sought a platform for further expansion in the Middle East and Africa. Amoun was the largest domestic drugmaker in Egypt, according to a press release at the time.
 The North American pharmaceutical group was seeking a buyer for Amoun in 2016, people with knowledge of the matter have said, though those discussions ended without a deal. Amoun offers both veterinary and human medicines in the region and sells products including antibiotics, anti-diarrheals and drugs that fight high blood pressure.
 An acquisition of Amoun by ADQ would add to $202 billion of deals targeting health-care companies this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s 45% down on the same period in 2019 as the pandemic subdues dealmaking across most major sectors.

Roma, 16 ott. - (Adnkronos) - 'Coltivare, nutrire, preservare. Insieme'. E' questo il tema del World Food Day, la giornata mondiale dell'alimentazione promossa e istituita dalla Fao, che si celebra oggi. La crisi sanitaria globale del Covid-19 è stata un'occasione per riflettere sulle cose che ci stanno veramente a cuore e sulle nostre esigenze essenziali. Questo periodo di incertezze ha fatto riaccendere in molti di noi l'apprezzamento per qualcosa che spesso diamo per scontato e che molti non possono permettersi: il cibo.


  In un momento come questo è più importante che mai riconoscere la necessità di sostenere i nostri eroi dell'alimentazione (agricoltori e operatori lungo l'intera filiera alimentare) che ci garantiscono che gli alimenti arrivino dai campi alle nostre tavole nonostante sconvolgimenti senza precedenti. Per questo motivo il World Food Day assume oggi un valore ancora più importante.


  Consapevole di questo, Syngenta, tra i leader dell'agribusiness a livello mondiale, ha realizzato un video per sottolineare una volta di più il ruolo fondamentale dei #foodheroes, che lavorano 365 giorni all'anno per produrre e distribuire il cibo a prescindere da tutte le situazioni avverse e che, forse in un momento e in una giornata dedicata all'Alimentazione, meritano un plauso ancora maggiore.


  “Nella Giornata Mondiale dedicata all'Alimentazione, è doveroso quest'anno ricordarsi dei nostri #EroiDellAlimentazione - ha sottolineato Riccardo Vanelli, ad di Syngenta Italia – agricoltori e operatori dell'intera filiera agroalimentare che con il loro lavoro impegno hanno contribuito e contribuiscono ogni giorno ad alimentare un Paese che non si arrende".


  "Il nostro pensiero e sostegno è rivolto a tutti coloro che con le loro mani si prendono cura della terra, a quelli che aiutano a proteggere i raccolti, a chi produce materie prime per l'industria e a chi trasporta il cibo per farlo arrivare sulle nostre tavole. A tutte queste persone, uomini e donne, che stanno lavorando instancabilmente, perché hanno radici solide e uno sguardo fiero rivolto al futuro. A questa filiera che non si ferma, tutti noi di Syngenta vogliamo dire grazie” conclude Vanelli.

Runa, who started playing the game on Thursday's episode, has been trying for KBC ever since the show started, but in vain. Her numerous attempts made her a butt of jokes and the 43-year-old didn't even disclose that she had made it to the prelim stages of the show to her family till her interview happened. On Thursday, she was the last contestant left after host Amitabh Bachchan started the game with three participants. She started crying when she didn't make to the hot seat. Seeing her getting emotional, Big B called her to the hot seat. She broke down once she was seated and had to be consoled by the host as well as her daughter and husband. Meet our contestant RUNA SAHA tonight at 9 pm in #KBC12 only on Sony TV. @SrBachchan @SPNStudioNEXT pic.twitter.com/4d2jxHhUyX&mdash; sonytv (@SonyTV) October 15, 2020 Amitabh told her that the time to cry was past and offered her a tissue. She told the actor that she had decided that if she failed to make it to the hot seat, she would never watch TV again or pray to God.A homemaker-turned- entrepreneur, she said she started a business to sell saris after her husband told her to earn money if she wants to donate it.

All across Amerika and the other First World quisling nations where the dollar reigned supreme, a massive and impossibly elaborate prison was constructed, only it wasn't built with concrete walls, armed towers, and concertina wire. It was built with gaudy McMansions, mile-high skyscrapers, and name-brand pharmaceuticals. The people of the First World were given two choices, they could comply with the great Amerikan imperial machine and live high as a kite in gilded cages decorated with the jewels of the Third World, or we could join them in the gulags and ghettos often found within walking distance of palaces and shopping malls. We were given a choice to wake and suffer or sleep and dream. Many chose to sleep, but their slumber didn't last long.

MARION S.C. — The Marion Swamps returned to Region 7-2A action, hosting the Latta Vikings Thursday night. Marion’s defense forced just enough turnovers to outlast Latta 26-6 on a rain drenched Fox Field.


  A late fourth quarter interception returned 26 yards for a touchdown from Jamiek Nichols sealed the deal as the Swamp Foxes forced a pair of block punts, recovered a fumble and intercepted three passes on the game.


  “It feels good just the fact that we have been out two weeks after losing a big time game before,” Marion coach Randall State said. “Teams start game- planning and it gets tough in this conference. Non region be a little easier because the teams you don’t know. These teams know each other and gets a little tough week to week.”

While many historical obstacles to voting have been eliminated over the years, some challenges remain and resemble those of the past, according to a Thursday presentation sponsored by the Diversity Action Team of Rock County.


  The organization held a virtual presentation titled “So You Think You Can Vote?” It covered the history of voting in the U.S. and the challenges that still exist for people trying to exercise their right to do so.


  The overarching theme: Everyone who can vote should vote.


  The presentation came two weeks and five days before the Nov. 3 general election to decide, among many other things, who will be president come January.


  This election already carries a historical distinction as unprecedented numbers of people are voting absentee because of the coronavirus pandemic.


  Lisa Johnson of the League of Women Voters encouraged people to plan now for how and when they will vote. Wisconsin residents can no longer register to vote online for the November election but can register at polling places on Election Day.


  Philip Chen, a political science professor at Beloit College, said many explicitly racist and discriminatory acts of voter suppression—such as literacy tests and poll taxes—have long been outlawed.


  But obstacles to voting still exist, specifically for marginalized groups such as people of color, indigenous people, low-income people, people with disabilities and others, Chen said.


  Chen focused on two issues—voter ID laws and gerrymandering.


  Voter ID laws, while not overtly discriminatory, can be suppressive by way of how the laws are carried out and because of those who more often are affected by the laws, Chen said.


  Wisconsin is one of 33 states that requires showing identification to cast a vote. Wisconsin’s law requires a valid photo ID.


  Enforcement of the law lies heavily in the hands of poll workers, an aspect of the law similar to the discriminatory handling of literacy tests prior to the Voting Rights Act of 1965, Chen said.


  A New Mexico study showed 69% of all voters were likely to be asked for an ID at the polls, Chen said, while Hispanic voters were asked to show ID 85% of the time.


  Voter ID laws also erect barriers for people who are less likely to have an ID—most often people of color or low-income individuals, Chen said.


  Meanwhile, gerrymandering can lead people to think their vote matters less when their districts are not competitive, possibly discouraging people from voting, Chen said.


  Critics have said Wisconsin’s legislative maps, drawn in 2010 by a Republican Legislature and approved by then-Gov. Scott Walker, are heavily gerrymandered to favor Republicans. That makes for less competitive races in state and federal elections, Chen said.


  Chen noted absentee voting and recent distrust of the U.S. Postal Service could cause further challenges to the November election but are not yet considered widely as suppressing voting.


  Voters will be able to do in-person absentee voting starting Tuesday, Oct. 20. Voters should contact their municipal clerks or visit myvotewi.gov for more information.

ATHENS, Oct 15 (Reuters) - Greece accused Turkey on Thursday of deliberately holding up a government aircraft carrying its foreign minister home from Iraq, leaving it circling for 20 minutes before granting it permission to cross Turkish airspace.


  Turkey denied the accusation, saying the aircraft had taken off from Iraq without a flight plan but had been allowed to pass once one was procured.


  Tensions between the two NATO allies, locked in a dispute over maritime boundaries in the eastern Mediterranean, have been simmering amid claims and counter-claims to marine areas thought to be rich in natural gas.


  "It is one more provocation in Turkey's series of provocations," Greek government spokesman Stelios Petsas told reporters. "I hope the incident is not repeated in the future."


  He said Greece's foreign ministry had complained to the Turkish authorities.


  Turkish foreign ministry spokesman Hami Aksoy dismissed the suggestion that the plane carrying Greek Foreign Minister Nikos Dendias had been deliberately held up as a provocation to Athens.


  "The plane in question took off from Iraq without presenting a flight plan. When the plane entered our air space, a flight plan was urgently requested from Iraqi authorities, and the flight was safely carried out after the plan was received," he said.


  He said Turkey had granted permission to a Greek request for the minister's plane to pass over its air space en route to Iraq on October 14.


  After that plane malfunctioned in Iraq, Greece sent a second aircraft which was also granted permission to fly through Turkish air space, "with the same flight permission number, without any delay", Aksoy said.


  Separately on Thursday, France and Germany accused Turkey of continuing to provoke the European Union with its actions in the eastern Mediterranean, and gave it a week to clarify its positions. (Reporting by George Georgiopoulos in Athens and Tuvan Gumrukcu in Istanbul Editing by Gareth Jones)

BRUSSELS, Oct 15 (Reuters) - Britain is free to diverge from European Union rules after Dec. 31, but that divergence must be reasonable if it wants zero- tariff and zero-quota access to the bloc's 450 million consumers and 22 million companies, the EU's Brexit negotiator said.


  "We are absolutely determined to reach a fair deal with the UK. We will do everything that we can, but not at any price," Michel Barnier told a news conference after EU leaders discussed the impasse in Brexit negotiations.


  My negotiation team and I will continue intensive discussions over the coming weeks," he said. "Our position has been crystal clear... If you want access to our market of 450 million people, there must be a level playing field."
