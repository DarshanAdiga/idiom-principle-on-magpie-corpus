CAPE GIRARDEAU, Mo. (KFVS) - We just passed Halloween, so the yearly battle begins whether Christmas should be celebrated before Thanksgiving or not.People in the Heartland are already putting up their Christmas tree. They tell us they want to feel the joy from the Christmas season sooner, rather than wait until after Thanksgiving.One woman we spoke with said 2020 has been challenging in many ways and wanted to feel some joy and reduce some mental stress as well.“To have things around your home and in your space, or that just bring you joy that are happy and beautiful; that may be bringing good memories and things like that, for me that’s vital,” Megan Goncher said.Mental Health Counselor at Community Counseling Center Dr. Sharon Braun, PhD, LPC, said it’s important to be with one’s self. She said if you are feeling down, it is never to early to put up a Christmas tree as she thinks it is very therapeutic.“If you are feeling down, I think it would give you a very therapeutic way to be one with yourself. It keeps you from getting caught up with the world’s nonsense.”Others, like Goncher, like the feeling of Christmas and put up decorations early. Goncher put hers up on Sunday after Halloween. She wanted to do it as she relaxed and got ready for the following week.“After I got done, I thought, ‘I am so thankful I am doing this so early so I get to enjoy the fruits of that labor for a few more weeks as opposed to right after Thanksgiving when it’s most common to put your tree up,’” Goncher said.Braun went as far to say when it comes to relieving stress, do what makes you happy.“I have Christmas trees that I have decorated in my house. It always brings me joy when I look at them,” Braun said. “Be your own best friend and if you want to put up a tree in June, I think that is very therapeutic.”Copyright 2020 KFVS.

No. 8 Florida at No. 5 Georgia. This will go a long way to deciding the SEC Eastern Division when these teams play Saturday. The Gators (3-1) went three weeks between games with a bye week after a postponement due to a team COVID-19 outbreak that included head coach Dan Mullen testing positive. Florida returned to action last week and looked as crisp as ever in a 41-17 victory over Missouri. Gators quarterback Kyle Trask has thrown four or more TD passes in each of his three games this season. Georgia (4-1) bounced back from its loss to Alabama with a 14-3 win over Kentucky. The Bulldogs are playing championship-style defense, limiting opponents to 300 yards of offense a game -- while Florida is averaging over 430 yards so far. But Georgia is dealing with injuries on defense, most notably to cornerback Richard LeCounte who was in motorcycle accident and won't play against the Gators. LeCounte was moved out of intensive care Monday. Georgia coach Kirby Smart said defensive lineman Julian Rochester won't play because of a knee injury.

Brady’s razor-sharp presence of mind and the plethora of talented pieces around him have been crucial in masking any struggles with accuracy so far. The offensive line in particular are giving the 43-year-old ample time in the pocket, while Mike Evans (joint receiving touchdown leader with seven), a receiver who can beat down a defensive back in the red zone and snatch an offbeat throw, has been impossible to defend. On that note, the old double act with Rob Gronkowski is finding rhythm. Where Tampa rise above the rest is how the offense’s conservative style complements Todd Bowles’ aggressive tactics on defense, ranked best in the league per Football Outsiders. Bowles blitzes with reckless abandon to bludgeon and confuse offenses. Off the back of this chaos, the Bucs have picked off 11 passes which leads the league, and are joint-second in the sack race with 28. Bowles gives the Bucs a great chance to win it all by quickly putting the ball back in Brady’s hands while limiting the opposition’s scoring.

GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (AP) — Police are investigating vandalism that left several headstones at a Jewish cemetery in Grand Rapids spray- painted with “TRUMP” and “MAGA” before President Donald Trump held his final campaign rally in the western Michigan city. Grand Rapids police spokesman Sgt. John Wittkowski says officers found six headstones spray-painted with “relatively new” red paint on Monday. “TRUMP” was spray-painted on the back of four headstones, and “MAGA” was spray-painted on two others. The vandalized graves were discovered at the Ahavas Israel Cemetery hours before Trump visited Grand Rapids late Monday in his final campaign rally before Election Day.Copyright 2020 Associated Press.

Let’s assume Joe Biden narrowly wins the electoral college, and the Trump team lodges a series of court challenges to overturn results in Michigan and Pennsylvania, possibly elsewhere.The cases may drag on for the rest of the year.Trump has already sent out a fundraising appeal for money to “FIGHT BACK”, and has signalled he will pursue appeals all the way to the Supreme Court.The cases will revolve around the acceptance of late ballots – that is, votes that arrive after last Tuesday, November 3, even if they are postmarked earlier. Each state has its own requirements for accepting mail-in votes, and the Trump lawyers will explore every possible objection.There is a conservative majority on the US Supreme Court, but this does not guarantee Trump would win appeals. When the court last decided an election, after the “hanging chads” dispute that delivered Florida to George W. Bush in 2000, it divided on partisan lines.How Bernie Sanders Predicted Trump’s Poll Night Response Days Ago But judges are conscious of their historical legacy and they will act cautiously. If Trump is appealing results in several states, it is unlikely all appeals will succeed.What Is Biden In ForSo let’s assume that, after a month of disputed returns, Biden is able to muster the bare minimum of 270 electoral college votes and Congress ratifies his election in January. On 20 January 2021 he would become the 46th president of the United States.Biden would immediately face a bitterly divided country, with millions of voters convinced he’d stolen the presidency. The Democrats’ almost certain failure to capture the Senate means he would struggle to win support for most of the key legislation he has promised.At this point, we need speculative fiction rather than political science to predict what might happen next. If congressional Republicans adopt a policy of total resistance to the Biden presidency, he will struggle even to appoint a cabinet, as all positions need to be ratified by the Senate.Over the past four years, the Republican Party has become essentially the party of Donald Trump, and those senators who have retained their seats will feel even more indebted to him.Biden’s central pitch was that he could heal divisions and bring Americans together again. It was his persona as a political veteran who had the capacity for empathy and working across party lines that persuaded the Democrats to rally behind him.Trump’s Team Files Lawsuits in Penn, Georgia, Michigan Over VotingBut for Biden to succeed in healing the country, there needed to be an undisputed win for the Democrats across the board, which would allow a new administration to quickly take control. Biden is far less well equipped to govern a country where millions of people will not see him as their legitimate president.Trump Remains a Tough CompetitorOn ABC television, Leigh Sales expressed her amazement that in a country torn apart by a major epidemic, economic distress and racial discord, the incumbent president could remain seriously competitive. The Democrats had assumed the impressive increase in turnout would work in their favour and they won swings in some areas of the country, especially in suburbia.But Trump also increased his vote among some groups the Democrats had taken for granted, such as Hispanics in Florida and to a lesser extent Texas. Trump was able to energise millions of first-time voters and, against expectations, won a majority of white women. These are rough estimates based on available exit polling data.In retrospect, the Democrats badly misjudged the mood of the country, thinking people would vote for a grandfather figure who promised safety. Against Trump, Biden seemed doddery and a relic of Washington politics, even though he is only four years older.African-Americans remain the most loyal Democratic voters, so it is surprising many young black men, facing ongoing police brutality and unemployment, were not motivated to turn out to vote for Biden.Biden Accrues More Votes Than Any Other Prez Nominee in US HistoryTrump appears an aberration to those of us who expect politicians to exhibit a certain degree of civility and a willingness to compromise. But the past decade has seen the rise of macho autocrats, men such as Duterte in the Philippines, Bolsonaro in Brazil, Orban in Hungary.If we accept the United States is less exceptional than it likes to believe, it is not so surprising that so many might be drawn to Trump.(This is an opinion piece and the views expressed above are the author’s own.

The case, among many other claims launched in the lawsuit, centred around the Government of Quebec’s March 24, 2020 order suspending certain businesses from operating during the pandemic. As a result of the order, the tenant was unable operate its gym. The tenant, accordingly, stopped paying rent. The tenant claimed that, as per the Civil Code of Quebec, it didn’t need to pay rent because the order created a “superior force” (a _force majeure_ event) that interfered with the landlord’s ability to provide the tenant with peaceable enjoyment of the premises, a responsibility clearly stated in the lease and in breach by the landlord. This breach relieved the tenant from its obligation to pay rent until the “superior force” came to an end.

Here are things to watch in Week 7 in the Southeastern Conference:
 GAME OF THE WEEK
 No. 8 Florida at No. 5 Georgia. This will go a long way to deciding the SEC Eastern Division when these teams play Saturday. The Gators (3-1) went three weeks between games with a bye week after a postponement due to a team COVID-19 outbreak that included head coach Dan Mullen testing positive. Florida returned to action last week and looked as crisp as ever in a 41-17 victory over Missouri. Gators quarterback Kyle Trask has thrown four or more TD passes in each of his three games this season. Georgia (4-1) bounced back from its loss to Alabama with a 14-3 win over Kentucky. The Bulldogs are playing championship-style defense, limiting opponents to 300 yards of offense a game -- while Florida is averaging over 430 yards so far. But Georgia is dealing with injuries on defense, most notably to cornerback Richard LeCounte who was in motorcycle accident and won't play against the Gators. LeCounte was moved out of intensive care Monday. Georgia coach Kirby Smart said defensive lineman Julian Rochester won't play because of a knee injury.
 MATCHUP OF THE WEEK
 Texas A&M quarterback Kellen Mond against South Carolina's secondary. This will be Mond's fourth start against the Gamecocks (2-3) and he's thriving in coach Jimbo Fisher's attack, steadily moving up career lists for the Aggies (4-1). Mond has already set career marks for passing yards and completions. He's within four touchdowns of holding that record, too. It won't be easy with the way South Carolina's secondary has played. The group has allowed just nine passing touchdowns this season and they bedeviled Auburn quarterback Bo Nix with three interceptions in a 30-22 victory in South Carolina's last home game three weeks ago.

Arthur Steven Bendall; cool Dad, motorcycle enthusiast, joker, lover of plaid, hunter, and all-around nice guy, died on Monday, October 26th, 2020. Art will be remembered as a man of the people who dabbled in everything from scuba diving to taekwondo. Many will miss his signature laugh, easy conversation, and homemade pancakes. He was an amazing father who left his sons with not only the 'Bendall ears' and ability to be heard in a crowd, but also with his sense of humour, open-hearted kindness, and appreciation of a good bargain. When Art went to that raisin pie in the sky, he left behind sons Joseph (Jess) and Jacob, his five brothers and their wives, Bill (Karen), Ray (Marie), Bob (Kathy), Charlie (Karen), Rodger (Tammy), his sister Kathy, many amazing nieces and nephews, innumerable friends, and his not-yet-born first grandchild. Art is joining his beloved parents, Bill and Doris, older brother Fred, nephew Paul, and of course, his favourite dog, Babe. Everyone who remembers him is asked to celebrate Art's life in their own little way; raising a glass of Bud Light would be quite appropriate. Should you wish, donations can be made to the Heart &amp; Stroke Foundation in Art's name. Although we know a ceremony for Art could have easily filled the Memorial Centre, in light of current restrictions, we are opting for a small family affair.

MYRTLE BEACH, SC (WMBF) - It’s a milder start to the day with temperatures in the mid 40s inland and the 50s along the beaches this morning. If you’re inland, you’ll want to still grab that jacket as you head out the door this morning but you will not need it for long! Highs will reach the low- mid 70s this afternoon.Temperatures will quickly warm today as we reach the upper 60s to lower 70s by lunchtime. Highs will reach the mid 70s by the afternoon hours under a mix of sun and clouds as onshore flow starts to blow into the area. We will remain dry for today but that onshore flow will begin to bring isolated showers back into the forecast for the weekend. Highs will reach the mid 70s through the weekend in the Grand Strand with a few isolated showers off and on.Humidity, temperatures and a few stray showers will be around for Friday and into the weekend. Highs will gradually climb into the mid 70s by Friday and Saturday before the upper 70s become common inland on Sunday. Each afternoon will feature a 20-30% chance of a shower but it will not be widespread, significant rain. An onshore flow off the Atlantic will not only be responsible for the warmer weather this weekend but we could see that onshore flow linger into next week. Keep an eye on Eta. Depending on the track, we could see tropical moisture and onshore flow well into next week, increasing our rain chances for Tuesday &amp; Wednesday. For now, we’ll only raise Wednesday to 40%. Remember, this will change. Stay updated to us for the latest. We're keeping an eye on Eta down in the south because by next week, we could see increasing moisture and the onshore flow continue with increased rain chances for the middle of next week. It's still early but something we will continue to watch.Copyright 2020 WMBF. All rights reserved.

SPIJKENISSE, Netherlands (AP) — The front carriage of a Dutch metro train that landed on a sculpture of a whale’s tail after plowing through the end of an elevated section of rails was painstakingly lifted clear of the artwork Tuesday and lowered to the ground.The train was left precariously balanced on the whale’s tail 33 feet above the ground Monday, after plunging off the end of a metro line in Spijkenisse, a town on the southern edge of Rotterdam. Two large yellow cranes worked in tandem Tuesday, placing chains around the front and rear of the train’s foremost carriage to support it. In an operation that started at dawn and lasted into the darkness of evening, workers also cut it loose from another carriage and removed its wheels before the train was lowered slowly to the ground.About 30 people watching the operation cheered as the front carriage finally was separated from the rest of the train amid gathering darkness and cheered again when it was deposited on the ground. The train was empty at the time it crashed onto the sculpture and the driver escaped unhurt, thanks to the whale tail’s unlikely catch.The local security authority said the driver was interviewed by police Monday as part of the investigation into the cause of the crash and allowed to go home.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.

Szpital jest już gotowy, ale rozpoczęcie działalności leczniczej to zupełnie coś innego. Łóżka także są gotowe, jednak musimy jeszcze sprawdzić określone procedury, np. proces ewentualnej ewakuacji, a to zajmuje czas – wyjaśnia DGP dr Artur Zaczyński, który odpowiada za kwestie medyczne w Szpitalu Narodowym. Chodzi o rzeczy praktyczne – na przykład sprawdzenie, czy nie ma wystających ostrych krawędzi, które mogą uszkodzić kombinezony ochronne, czy zorganizowanie autobusów do ewentualnej ewakuacji w razie pożaru. W kolejnym etapie Narodowy ma mieć możliwość przyjęcia nawet tysiąca pacjentów, ale nie wiadomo, kiedy będzie w stanie przyjąć aż tylu chorych. – Tak szybka organizacja tego miejsca to naprawdę duże osiągnięcie – mówi jeden z naszych rozmówców związanych ze stadionem. Warto jednak przypomnieć, że decyzja o budowie i organizacji tego szpitala zapadła dopiero w połowie października. Mimo że przedstawiciele rządu twierdzili, że jesteśmy gotowi na drugą falę pandemii, żaden szczegółowy plan budowy sieci szpitali tymczasowych nie był wcześniej przygotowany.

Uma das preocupações dos reguladores é com a redução da inovação. Em um artigo publicado na revista MIT Technology Review, Alec Stapp, diretor de política e tecnologia do think tank Instituto de Política Progressiva — organização que recebe doações de Amazon, Facebook e Google —, argumenta que a inovação não está morta por causa do tamanho das empresas, tampouco houve prejuí­zo para o consumidor. Ele cita o caso do Zoom, aplicativo de videoconferências que cresceu mesmo enfrentando concorrência acirrada de empresas como Google e Microsoft. O Zoom tinha 10 milhões de participantes em reuniões diárias em dezembro e passou para 300 milhões em abril de 2020, impulsionado pela pandemia. Stapp também critica o relatório do Congresso americano que defende a divisão dos gigantes da tecnologia. Para ele, isso dissolveria as plataformas e tornaria inviáveis os negócios.

Personal health care decisions have a lasting impact on our kids and our families, so let's rise to the occasion and utilize this unique opportunity to reframe the conversation about vaccines.
