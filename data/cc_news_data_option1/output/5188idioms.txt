The company has stated that it sees evidence of pent up demand for travelling with 50% of May 2021 capacity already sold in spite of new lockdowns and high international travel uncertainty. Further, the economic benefits of tourism to host countries will mean its a sector that national governments will be keen to stimulate post-pandemic. This will likely see a doubling down on tourism budgets and marketing campaigns in the months ahead.
 ## _Tourism Has Been Decimated In 2020 But The Long-Term Trend Has Been Up_
 International travel in the new year will be patchy with some national lockdowns continuing into early January with quarantines placed on travellers likely being in place for most of the first half of the year. However, the clear desire for travel which cannot be satiated by image searches or watching videos represents a structurally sound tailwind that will drive TUI's recovery in the years ahead.
 The importance of tourism cannot be overstated. Most countries have tourist boards or strategic policies to boost their annual tourist figures, travelling has made bucket lists since its invention, and cultivating new experiences in foreign countries is seen as a rite of passage.
 These are all factors that have driven tourism for the best part of a century. Hence, while it has been locked away and out of sight for most of 2020, the trend has been upwards and should recover. How long this takes will depend on the pace of vaccine rollout. The lack of any significant or sustained logistical and manufacturing challenges could see a close return to normality by the end of summer 2021 with travel picking up in the months beforehand. This will mean the industry will once again return to growth and will once again help people cultivate new sights and sounds, new memories, and new experiences.

Gultekin said his client was not aware of the scheme to smuggle Ghosn and expressed hope that he would be acquitted at the next hearing.
 Ghosn, who was arrested over financial misconduct allegations in Tokyo in 2018, skipped bail while awaiting trial last year. He was flown from Osaka to Istanbul and then transferred onto another plane bound for Beirut, where he arrived Dec. 30. He is believed to have been smuggled inside a large, foam- covered music box.
 The pilots and flight attendants have denied involvement in the plans to smuggle Ghosn or of knowing that Ghosn was aboard the flights.
 The airline official, Okan Kosemen, claimed he was made aware that Ghosn was on board the flight from Osaka to Istanbul after the plane landed. He admitted helping smuggle Ghosn onto the second, Beirut-bound plane, but claimed he was threatened and feared for his family's safety.
 Turkish airline company MNG Jet said in January that two of its planes were used illegally in Ghosn’s escape, flying him from Osaka to Istanbul, and then to Beirut. The company said at the time that its employee had admitted to falsifying flight records so that Ghosn’s name didn’t appear on them.
 The indictment against the defendants notes a 216,000-euro and $66,000 increase in the airline official’s bank accounts between Oct. 16 and Dec. 26, 2019.

BELLE PLAINE, Kan. (AP) — The dashcam video captured a horrific scene: a Kansas sheriff's deputy in a patrol truck mowing down a Black man who was running, shirtless, across a field in the summer darkness after fleeing a traffic stop.
 Lionel Womack — a 35-year-old former police detective from Kansas City, Kansas — alleges in a excessive force lawsuit filed Thursday that he sustained serious injuries when Kiowa County Sheriff's Deputy Jeremy Rodriguez intentionally drove over him during the Aug. 15 encounter.
 Womack said in a statement that he hadn't been speeding nor was he under the influence of anything when he was initially pulled over. His driver's license, insurance and registration were up to date.
 “When the first officer turned his lights on, I pulled over and complied … exactly as you're supposed to. But when three additional vehicles pulled up quickly and started to surround my car, I freaked out. That's when I took off, it was a ‘fight or flight’ moment and I was going to live,” he said. “I felt like I was in danger. This was out in the country, late at night, and it was dark. So I ran for my life. That's what you see in the dashcam video. I'm running in an open field, and I'm scared.”
 The graphic video is at the crux of the federal civil rights case filed by attorney Michael Kuckelman against the deputy in U.S. District Court in Kansas. The lawsuit argues that Rodriguez used excessive force and was “callously indifferent” to Womack's civil rights.
 Womack had left the police department earlier in August with hopes of growing his own security business. He was on his way back home from a business trip to California when a Kansas Highway Patrol officer in western Kansas initiated a chase over “an alleged traffic violation,” according to the lawsuit. Sheriff's deputies from Pratt County and Kiowa County joined in the chase.

The Household Pulse Survey includes data for the 15 largest metro areas (and we just make the cut at No. 15). And of those 15, Seattle had the highest percentage of respondents who answered that they had feeling of depression or hopelessness in the past week.
 Perhaps the lack of sunlight isn't much of a factor, because we effectively tied with one of the sunniest places in the country: Phoenix (49.1%). Then again, as I wrote about in a recent column, tons of folks from the Seattle area have been moving to Arizona in recent years, so maybe that's our effect?
 The metro area with lowest reports of feelings of depression in mid-November was New York, at 37%, which still seems like a high number.
 It would be helpful if this survey had existed prepandemic, so we had a baseline with which to compare the current numbers. Unfortunately, it didn't. So it's impossible to say how much worse Seattleites are feeling now than they normally might.
 Perhaps it's not unusual for half the adults in the Seattle area to have feelings of depression in any given week. But that seems unlikely. And in fact, there is evidence that the pandemic has had a profound negative effect on American's mental health. A report from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) found that depression had quadrupled among adults during the pandemic, when compared with data from 2019.

But the mix up swung momentum back to the hosts as India finished on 6-233 at stumps.
 “(It was) massive, obviously a wicket like that or a run-out, especially Virat Kohli, it was massive,” Lyon said post-match.
 “It’s good to be back on the board after the Ashes so I’m pretty stoked with that.”
 Lyon appeared to hold the ball as if it were a new-born baby he was scared to drop before dislodging the bails.
 Asked if the Stokes let off was running through his mind, Lyon replied: “No, no, no. It did after Josh ran up to me saying, ‘He’s back, he’s back’.
 “There was a bit of banter being thrown around out there but a massive wicket there off Virat Kohli who was obviously batting extremely well, so pretty happy with that one.”
 Lyon was involved in a running verbal battle with Kohli throughout the captain’s classy knock.
 “I’m one for all the banter and conversations staying out in the middle so I won’t reveal what we were talking about but it was all in good fun, all good conversations,” he said when asked to reveal what was said.
 “… It was a good challenge, I’m always up for the challenge against the best players in the world so it was all good fun.”
 Meanwhile, Lyon defended the decision not to review a possible gloved catch when the skipper was on 16.
 Hot Spot showed a slight mark on Kohli’s glove and snicko showed a minor deviation indicating he may have tickled the leg-side delivery to Tim Paine.
 “From my angle it was totally out of sight for me, it wasn’t my best ball and I couldn’t hear any noise, it was quite windy out there,” Lyon said.

 # Cooper Hewitt acquires two emoji that symbolize inclusion
 Leanne Italie
 Associated Press
 View Comments
 _New York_ — The Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum has acquired two emoji that have helped broaden diversity for users of the tiny pictures, becoming the third museum to add emoji to their digital collections.
 The New York museum acquired the “person with headscarf” and “inter-skintone couple” emoji for its burgeoning collection of digital assets. The museum plans an exhibition on the significance of the two through interviews and images, but the pandemic has put an opening date in limbo, said Andrea Lipps, Cooper Hewitt's associate curator of contemporary design.
 “The desire to acquire these particular emoji arose from what we were seeing as the desire for inclusion and representation of various groups and communities and couples on the emoji keyboard,” Lipps told The Associated Press in an interview ahead of Thursday's announcement.
 The hijab emoji, as it's informally known, was submitted in 2016 to the Unicode Consortium, a nonprofit that oversees emoji standards with voting members from the world's top digital companies. It arrived on phones and computers in 2017. A then 15-year-old Saudi Arabian girl, Rayouf Alhumedhi, attracted worldwide attention as she campaigned for its inclusion. She was selected as one of Time magazine's most influential teens of 2017.
 Roughly 550 million women in the world wear the hijab, Alhumedhi among them, yet there was no emoji to represent them. The same was true of skin tones, and advocates remain vigilant in getting multiracial family emoji on keyboards, beyond the two-person couple options.
 The interracial couple emoji was submitted to Unicode in 2018 and arrived on devices last year, giving people their first chance to combine multiple skin tones in a single emoji. It builds on the advocacy work of Katrina Parrott, a Black, Houston-based entrepreneur inspired to create diverse skin tones in emoji after her daughter lamented she couldn't properly represent herself on keyboards.
 As a third-party developer, Parrott was the first to put out multiracial emoji through her own app, iDiversicons, five years ago. She advocated as a non- voting member of Unicode for the consortium to do the same for a wide array of devices. A campaign leading to the inclusion of interracial couples, later spearheaded by the dating app Tinder and others, received a Webby Award last year. Parrott was not involved in development of the couples emoji but noted the significance in promoting greater diversity.
 Parrott had no technical experience when she took on her project, but as a former NASA contract worker in logistics, she knew how to put together a team.
 “We said we don't want to do just an app for African Americans. We want to represent the world because everybody was feeling the lack in emojis," Parrott told the AP of her pioneering app. “We did African American skin tone, we did Asian, Caucasian, folks from India and those who are Latino and Hispanic. We covered all the bases.”
 Now 19 and a sophomore at Stanford University, Alhumedhi said she decided to get involved after realizing she had no way to represent herself in a WhatsApp group chat with friends when they switched from photos to emoji in their profiles. She stumbled across a Snapchat story on how to submit a proposal for new emoji to the Unicode Consortium, where heavy hitters like Apple, Twitter, Facebook and more decide what emoji are released for companies to choose from.
 Media attention flowed after Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanion facilitated an Ask Me Anything session for Alhumedhi on his platform to get the word out on her emoji campaign. She also received help from Emojination’s Jennifer 8. Lee.
 “We talked about how representation is so important, even if it appears in such a small way,” Alhumedhi told the AP from Vienna, where she's waiting out her return to her California campus. “We also wanted to trigger a dialogue about the hijab itself and what it means in today's digital age. I saw a lot of people having very big opinions about the hijab without really discussing it with someone who wears it or doing further introspection into what it means.”
 The hijab and interracial couples emoji were designed by Aphelandra Messer, who was working at the time for Emojination, a grassroots group that advocates for more inclusive and representative emoji.
 The designs have “impacted billions of keyboards worldwide and reframed how people have seen themselves on the small screen. It’s amazing to see their historic work archived in the nation’s greatest museums for current fans and future scholars,” said Lee, producer of ”The Emoji Story," a new documentary film out Friday, and co-founder of Emojination.
 The Cooper Hewitt announcement follows the 2016 acquisition of the original DoCoMo emoji set by the Museum of Modern Art in New York. DoCoMo is a top mobile phone operator in Japan, where emoji began. In 2018, the Victoria & Albert Museum in London acquired the proposed mosquito emoji design. All are part of a larger effort for museums and cultural institutions to preserve significant parts of digital history and culture.

 # Former West Bloomfield Twp. police chief Ronald Cronin dies
 Mike Martindale
 The Detroit News
 View Comments
 _Orion Township_ — Retired West Bloomfield Township Police Chief Ronald D. Cronin died Wednesday night in hospice in an Orion Township assisted living facility. He was 77.
 Cronin was West Bloomfield’s top cop for 19 years before retiring in 2010. Before that he spent 24 years with the Detroit Police Department, working everything from narcotics and organized crime and arson. Among other roles, he was an executive lieutenant in the chief’s office and an inspector running special operations.
 Cronin received multiple citations and decorations during his career as a Detroit police officer, including a Purple Heart and the department’s highest honor, the Medal of Valor, after being wounded in the leg and hand in an early morning shootout inside a restaurant in 1974 where he was on an undercover assignment. The gunman killed three people and wounded others before Cronin fatally shot him, Warren Police Chief William Dwyer said.
 “Unquestionably Ron saved several other lives that night while risking his own,” said Dwyer, who was Cronin’s supervising sergeant at the time.
 “Ron was a good friend, a good cop respected by everyone who worked (with) and knew him and the toughest guy I ever met in more than 50 years of law enforcement.”
 Years later when Dwyer was chief of the Farmington Hills Police Department and Cronin headed West Bloomfield’s police force, they conducted joint investigations in Oakland County.
 “He had several medical issues, especially over the past 10 years, but he never complained,” said Dwyer, who recalled Cronin attending a charity golf outing for police officers wearing a helmet following a brain operation.
 Cronin had been in assisted living care following heart surgery a few years ago, his son said.
 Cronin grew up on Detroit’s west side near Seven Mile and Southfield, graduated from Detroit Benedictine High School and received a bachelor of arts degree from University of Mercy.
 He became a Detroit police officer in 1968 and in 1991 hired on as police chief in West Bloomfield. He served on boards of both the Michigan Association of Chiefs of Police and the Oakland Police Chiefs organization
 Cronin’s two sons, Kevin and Scott, followed him into police work. Scott is still a detective sergeant with the Farmington Hills force. Kevin, now retired, started his own investigations and security firm.
 “He loved life, loved being a cop, but loved his family even more,” said Kevin Cronin, who described his father as his “best friend.”
 “Scott and I followed in his footsteps. He taught us a lot of lessons as children and later more lessons as adults.”
 Cronin’s sons were with him in his final hours Wednesday and toasted him bedside with a traditional Irish prayer.
 “A few minutes later, Dad passed away peacefully,” he said.
 Cronin had a twin brother, Don, who died a month ago in Boca Raton, Fla. Don Cronin owned and operated the popular Dunleavy’s Irish Pub on Grand River for several years.
 In addition to his sons, Ron Cronin is also survived by an older sister, Pat Summers of St. Clair Shores; brothers Robert Cronin of Florida and William Cronin of Houghton Lake; five grandchildren, and one great-granddaughter. He and his former wife, Jolan, divorced after 27 years of marriage but remained friends, Kevin Cronin said.
 Funeral arrangements were still incomplete, his son said.
