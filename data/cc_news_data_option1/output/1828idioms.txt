In Europe, the collapse in business activity is triggering wage support programs that are keeping millions on the job, for now. In contrast, in the United States more than 33.5 million people have applied for jobless benefits and the unemployment rate has soared to 14.7%. Congress has passed $2 trillion in emergency support, boosting jobless benefits and writing stimulus checks of up to $1,200 per taxpayer.

Mount View and River View will also be turfed by the fall. Greenbrier East and Nicholas County high schools have played on synthetic turf for years.
 Raleigh County was able to secure the necessary money through its Capital Improvements Projects Fund. The project will cost a total of $3.6 million.
 The biggest detriment associated with grass surfaces is the effects of extreme weather. Excessive rain has turned fields into mud pits, and drought conditions have created dust bowls. And as Sarrett and Lilly can both attest, abnormally muddy fields can even render footballs unusable.
 “It’s not just for the five home games,” Sarrett said. “I’m excited for the daily practice and not having to practice in the mud or the dust. We’d go out there in late September or October and it’s pouring the rain and you’re walking around with mud over the top of your feet up to your ankles. You just couldn’t get anything done.”
 The fields at Shady Spring and Liberty will also be resurfaced, but not until next year. Both fields have bleacher repairs that need to be addressed before new turf can be installed.
 The bleacher work will start after the season.
 “They were afraid they might run into something that would prevent them from having that part of it finished before football season,” Price said. “They felt like after football season and into the winter and spring timeline will be fine for what they need to do then. Then they can roll right in with the turf project right after that.”

Charlie: Yeah everything is blooming, the tulips and the daffodils, and it's also time to do a few gardening chores. And one of them is to divide some of your perennials. But you've got to know which ones to divide when. For example you don't want to be dividing peonies and irises now because of course they're going to bloom soon! You do those more towards the fall. But things that bloom later in the season like the Rudbeckia and the Sedum's and the Astors you want to divide those now. Then there's what we call tried and true perennials were you can divide them anytime!

Indeed, viewership for both Raw and SmackDown has plummeted to historic lows since WrestleMania 36, likely due to the absence of stars like Brock Lesnar, Randy Orton, Edge, Goldberg and The Undertaker, who all disappeared following the pay-per-view and haven’t been seen since. As WWE’s audience continues to decrease while the quality of its shows does the same, it certainly stands to reason that WWE will pull out all the stops in order to make this show a memorable one. In fact, it’s already doing that with the first-ever pair of MITB matches in which six male and six female superstars will have to simultaneously “climb the corporate ladder” to the top of WWE Headquarters to win the coveted briefcase.

In the United States, former President Barack Obama harshly criticized his successor Donald Trump's handling of the coronavirus pandemic as an \"absolute chaotic disaster.\" The United States has seen 1.3 million infections and nearly 80,000 deaths in the pandemic - the most in the world by far, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. Worldwide, health officials are anxiously watching to see just how much infection rates rise in a second wave as nations and states emerge from varying degrees of lockdown. Here is a collection of photos from around the world, made by Associated Press photographers.

DETROIT (AP) — Some Michigan teachers are taking care of classroom pets that were removed from schools after Gov. Gretchen Whitmer announced closures in March due to the coronavirus outbreak. Scott Kefgen, who works at Harlan Elementary School in Birmingham, is one of those teachers. He houses geckos, turtles, frogs, a gerbil, lobster and about 30 fish. “The geckos are in the middle of my kitchen floor, my dining room table has the gerbil, and the frogs and the turtles are in this gigantic tank,” Kefgen said. Teachers are caring for different kinds of animals, not just traditional pets like hamsters and fish, the Detroit Free Press reported. “I went in to do the dishes and there was a frozen mouse thawing out in a cup of hot water in our kitchen,” said Elizabeth Paddock, whose husband, Jon, teaches ninth-grade biology at Clarkston Junior High School. The Paddock family is currently keeping three snakes, a turtle, skink and bearded dragon. Jon Paddock figured he’d take care of the animals for a few weeks. But when the governor announced in April that schools would remain closed, it dawned on the family that it was going to be more work than they originally thought. “That’s when I finally was able to put calls out to all my students and say, ‘OK, it’s time for people to volunteer to take animals,’ ” he said. He arranged a drop off for students to get the animals without touching one another. Unfortunately, every pet was not able to be moved to a teacher's home. But Scott Doty, who teaches biology at Berkley High School, is still taking care of his classroom animals. Doty has about 30 aquariums in his classroom holding about 300 fish. He couldn't move them, so he goes to the school to feed them. There is also a bearded dragon, a ball python, a...

Both candidates pledged to head to Washington as bipartisan problem-solvers; Smith noted she used to be a Republican at a time, she gibed, when the party’s lawmakers believed in balancing budgets. (“I’m one of those people who felt decades ago the party was leaving them and I just didn’t have a place there anymore,” Smith said in an interview, citing the GOP’s rightward shift on abortion, pay equity and environmental issues.)
 The debate spawned one bit of controversy. Soon after, Smith apologized for seeming to make light of Garcia’s military service during a video chat with supporters. “OK, he’s got pictures of planes behind him,” she said of their respective Zoom backdrops. “I’ve got constitutional law books.”
 Trump pounced. “Now she’s mocking our Great Vets!” he tweeted. “We need Navy Fighter Pilot Mike Garcia in #CA25!”
 Smith quickly fired back. “Mr. President on behalf of Americans let me suggest some better uses of your time,” she wrote. “Plan & support a national testing program. Withdraw your court case to destroy [the Affordable Care Act]. Support [the World Health Organization] so that when world scientists find a cure we aren’t sidelined. Be a leader. #TrumpDepression.”

 Garcia, 44, a defense industry executive and former Navy fighter pilot, has made Hill’s conduct a part of his campaign.
 “The last year and a half has been an embarrassment for our district,” he wrote in a recent opinion piece in the Santa Clarita Valley Signal, “and it’s time we restore integrity to our representation in our nation’s capitol.”
 Garcia has also vigorously campaigned against Democrats in Sacramento — even more than he has taken on Washington — saying the party’s dominance has turned California into a hellscape of homelessness, over-regulation and high taxes.

"Since then, we too believe that questions must be asked about the failure of the officers and Board of the SPFL in its primary duty of care to ALL 42 of its members, as has been stated by many other clubs in public but more often in private. The repeated use of the yes voting 81% as a validation of the Board’s position is risible at the very best. If a vote is seen as a gun to your head and if you don’t vote yes you will be financially disadvantaged during a complete industry shutdown with zero revenue coming in to any club and subsequently 81% vote for it, that does not validate the SPFL Board’s resolution, far from it. In effect you are voting under financial duress and it is disingenuous to continue to repeat that figure without putting it in that context. This however seems to be a consistent SPFL trope for a number of years now.
 "Appallingly, the SPFL Chairman and the SPFL CEO have also used their office to attack SPFL member clubs who did not agree with arguably the most important resolution in the history of the SPFL and it’s utterly botched aftermath and they have deliberately and shockingly chosen to do so in public. And in what looked suspiciously like a co-ordinated attack, all the while calling for unity and solidarity!? It is also bemusing to hear them so publicly state they are unaware of any threats or bullying during the period of the 9th or 10th of April when the CEO knows what happened as it was reported to him and they continue to accuse anyone who spoke out against this take it or leave it offer as having an agenda which should be questioned!
 "We fully admit to having an agenda, that is that no fellow member of the SPFL should be more financially damaged than we all already have been since the complete shutdown of our industry. We believed that no club should have been relegated or expelled during an unfinished season. We were not prepared to vote for that, even though we would have received the 2nd highest amount of fees in the entire 30 club payout – we could not do it. It was, in our opinion, a wretched resolution with wretched consequences but given the circumstances and manner it was presented in, we can totally understand why so many clubs voted for it. Very many had no choice because of the desperate need for finance and openly said so.

"We believe that the Premiership clubs were not furnished with the document until after their meeting ended at 1pm which is quite astonishing. Our meeting was delayed until several minutes after 1pm due to what seemed like a panicked and delayed information dump of the resolution to all clubs and the press and after the usual preambles and our SPFL CEO finished speaking, we were left with less than 30 minutes to ask questions on a crucial document which we were frantically trying to speed read, while at the same time listen to the complex 'reasoning' that was being given by our SPFL CEO and our SPFL legal advisor. In short, they presented the resolution as the only option. Numerous times the phrases “a gun to our head” or “take it or leave it” were used by various clubs on the call, including by ICTFC.
 "Without going into the specifics at this time, please know that we will testify to the bullying and threats made against our club on Friday 10th by an SPFL Board member and the threats against others by the same SPFL Board member and how these threats were 'reported back to the centre' and to the SPFL CEO directly on the day with evidence at any genuine independent investigation with the proper and appropriate scope, should there be one, or at any further subsequent action thereafter. These were threats and not robust conversations.
 "We believe that serious questions remain over the actions of the MD of one club during the now infamous vote on April 10th and what happened between the submission of their legally binding ‘No’ vote before the fake 5pm deadline and 5 days later when they became the only club out of 42 to have 'negotiations' with the CEO and Chairman of the SPFL and with 'big hitters' or persons unknown, before being allowed to vote for a second time. This time to carry the SPFL Board’s resolution with a Yes vote. A genuinely independent investigation is the only possible route to try and uncover what happened and it may or may not reveal the reasoning behind their apparently contradictory statements since then.
 "To be absolutely clear, since the shutdown on Friday 13th of March by the SFA, the BOD and Management of ICTFC has had and still have no issue with the clubs in 1st place of each division being awarded the league title if there is no possibility of winning those titles on the field of play, none whatsoever. We had and have absolutely no issue with any other club in the the SPFL voting anyway they felt was correct, none whatsoever. We have excellent relations with most clubs and this was never an us and them situation until the SPFL hierarchy made it thus. The fatal flaw in this whole process in our opinion was the conflation of two different things, that being the advancement of league fees in any shape or form by the SPFL and the forced relegation or expulsion of Hearts, Partick Thistle and Stranraer but not Brechin City. That is why we supported the alternative but ultimately stymied Rangers resolution along with Hearts. We were trying to separate the two as we believe they could and should have been all along.
