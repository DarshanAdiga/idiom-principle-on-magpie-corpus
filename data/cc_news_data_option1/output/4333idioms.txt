With restaurants around the country shuttering due to the drop in business from the coronavirus pandemic, the drop in temperatures approaching the winter season has posed a new challenge for businesses relying on outdoor dining.
 During the summer, with warmer temperatures and loosened restrictions on outdoor dining to help restaurants stay afloat, many Taunton-area restaurants noted that customers have preferred to dine outside versus indoors. In turn, those eateries have sought to continue outdoor dining as long as possible with the use of large tents, heaters and blankets.
 At Barrels and Boards in Raynham, owner David Laghetto said they had been utilizing tables on their patio for seating, but had expanded to tented seating in the parking lot. As temperatures have dropped, they've installed heaters that have warmed up the tent for diners, with Laghetto saying that tables have filled up both outdoors and inside the Route 138 restaurant.
 But with the tent not equipped to handle snow load, and with questions about whether the heaters will be sufficient when temperatures get brutally cold, there's the potential for them to lose over 20 tables as they can't be brought back inside due to distancing requirements, Laghetto said.
 "We don't know what the winter is going to bring and how long we can keep the tents up," he said. "We're hoping for Nov. 30, we don't know if it's going to be Nov. 30, but we're hoping for that long. We do know when snow season starts, which is considered Dec. 1, the tent will have to come down."
 At Emma's Pizza and Pub in Bridgewater, owner Ron Emma said they're also hoping to hang on to outdoor dining as long as possible, as he said he's looking to buy industrial heaters that blow heat into the tent instead of the outdoor patio heaters using propane that he's seen other businesses using.
 During the day when the weather is nice, more customers are choosing to sit outside, Emma said, but as it gets dark and temperatures decline, a greater number of customers choose to dine inside. But he expressed concern about the winter, more specifically when it starts to snow.
 "There are two things the tent can't withstand, and that's wind over 30 mph and then a heavy snow load," he said. "Between the wind and the snow load, we're going to go as far as we can until we can't."
 Along with extensive renovations inside to install plexiglass dividers and add filtration systems to filter out airborne pathogens, Maguire's Bar and Grill in Easton has also chosen to utilize outdoor tents with heaters that pump in fresh air from outside instead of recirculating the air inside.
 "We're pretty confident that we'll be able to handle the winter," owner Neil Levine said.
 Unlike other establishments that expressed concerns about snow load, Levine said he's confident in the heaters, noting that they're capable of increasing the temperature inside the tent 20 degrees -- though Levine said he had one night recently where it was 40 degrees and the heaters were able to raise the temperature inside the tent to 69 degrees.
 "With the heater on and the temperature at 70, we feel most of the snow will run off and melt upon contact," he said. "Anything that doesn't melt upon contact, we'll rake off. We constantly want to maintain our parking lots and roofs of our building, always raking snow off and keeping snow loads down so we'll be able to maintain a zero snow load on top of the tent. If it ever got ahead of us, we'd obviously not seat anyone inside the tent until we make sure it's safe."
 Over at another Easton establishment, The Farmer's Daughter, owner and executive chef Chandra Gouldrup said she's a bit more nervous with winter approaching. Unlike other restaurants that have the space to expand outdoor seating into parking lots and private spaces, Gouldrup said they had to receive special permission from town officials to expand outdoor dining to the sidewalk and several parking spots in front of the restaurant due to their lack of outdoor space, which has limited their setup.
 But Gouldrup said they've recently received verbal confirmation to look at tenting some of the outdoor space, which she hopes will help with the heating situation. While she's hoping to receive official confirmation to have it set up for this year, they've implemented some outdoor electric heating in the meantime.
 "I don't see us being able to bank on extending our outdoor dining just based off of heaters," she said. "I don't think it'll be enough, personally, but we're certainly going to try everything we can."
 And there's the concern about any possible tents being able to handle snow and also snow removal by the town, especially with them using parking spots for seating, she said.
 In the meantime, with chillier weather, Gouldrup said they've started selling fleece blankets with the restaurant's logo.
 "It was so well-received, people were buying them more as a keepsake than a warming item," she said.
 While previously the blankets were sold for $5, for which the restaurant ate half the cost, the popularity of the item has led them to recently increase the price to $10 to cover the cost of it without any profit for the restaurant, Gouldrup said -- and they're encouraging customers to bring them back to reuse while dining.
 "Just because everything has to be single-use right now, there's no way to launder them," she said. "A lot of the regulars have come in with them already. A new BYOB -- bring your own blanket."
 And while she said she's nervous as a business owner about the wintertime, she's hopeful customers will continue to come out to support the business.
 "I have been pleasantly surprised since we've opened that we've been able to persevere throughout all these COVID challenges and we're doing numbers I wouldn't even be dreaming to see at this time, considering our guests have really rallied and not let the weather impact things," she said. "We're hopeful the weather is going to continue to stay and guests will continue to support us as they have."

Dan Glazer, a Duke University professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences, has found that seniors who face social isolation experience a higher risk of mortality, heart disease, and depression.
 “One of the major public health problems in our country is social isolation, and [long-term care] homes want to keep COVID out of these institutions, so they lock down the institution,” reads a report from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine authored by Glazer and others. “But, over a long period of time that is not good for older persons. It affects their health and their well-being.”
 This might be news to Glazer, but those of us who have been around the elderly, especially those in nursing homes and Assisted Living Facilities, are well aware of what is happening. I wrote an article about it a month ago comparing how worried we are about children’s lack of socialization when our seniors saw nobody but staff for days on end. Further, unlike children, seniors are not tech savvy and very few know how to use FaceTime or Zoom.

 Saints defensive tackle Sheldon Rankins is seeing a pattern -- and an encouraging one at that.
 In each of the previous three seasons, the Saints overcame some early season adversity and swept all of their October games en route to an NFC South crown.
 For a fourth straight season, the Saints have won all of their October games again -- three this year because their bye fell in Week 6.
 The winning streak has New Orleans (4-2), which stumbled to a 1-2 start, just a half-game back of Tampa Bay for the top spot in the division with 10 games to go.
 "We don't ever plan for early season stumbles or anything like that, but ... adversity to start a season is nothing new to us. We've faced it before. We know what it takes to get on a roll and start winning some games," Rankins said. "We've always found a way to weather the storm. And we'll continue to get better and continue to fix the things that need to be fixed. And we'll get on a roll here."

At the top of the list was the idea that GO bonds are what other cities have done successfully for similar projects, citing Miami Beach as an example. Segurola said Miami Beach’s process actually shows the “exact opposite” of what Key Biscayne is doing because it was based on detailed projects, including “realistic time estimates.”
 Segurola was less optimistic than Davey on the status of the ongoing projects. If not timed correctly, he said, they could put the key under construction for several years. Delaying the GO bond referendum for a couple of years could give the village a chance to establish lists of viable projects to bring to a citizen’s advisory panel, with cost estimates and funding options, he said. In the meantime, he said, funding requirements for the village may change for the better, with possible federal help related to beach nourishment and FPL reimbursements.
 “We need to work on what we have and come up with a timeline for other projects,” he said. “If the referendum is rejected, we could do things the right way. This is a textbook example of how not to do GO bonds.”
 Davey countered that showing progress on the projects is critical and having permission to consider using the cheaper GO bonds when needed just makes sense. He said he trusts future village councils -- and the residents who vote them in -- to do the right thing in considering GO bonds as a financing method for the needed projects as they come up. “We can make things happen…this is our opportunity,’’ he said.

Oil is down on some supply and demand issues. Stimulus seems more and more unlikely by the day, at least pre- election.” The S&P 500 fell 64.42 points to 3,400.97. The Dow slumped 650.19 points, or 2.3%, to 27,685.38. The Nasdaq composite lost 189.34 points, or 1.6%, to 11,358.94.

SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) — When the San Francisco 49ers lost back- to-back home games to Philadelphia and Miami it appeared as if the season could be spiraling out of control for the defending NFC champions. Coach Kyle Shanahan saw enough glimmers of hope in those two losses to believe a turnaround was possible and the team has done just that with convincing wins the past two weeks over the Rams and New England. “I understood why we didn’t win those games, but it wasn’t anything to panic about,” Shanahan said Monday a day after San Francisco beat the Patriots 33-6. “It was just frustrating. We let a game get away from us I thought we should have won. Then the Miami game, obviously, we shouldn’t have won that game. We got blown out. It was a very embarrassing loss. But when you watch that tape and I wasn’t trying to BS the players, there was a lot of things to be encouraged about.” Those things have been very apparent the past two weeks as the Niners (4-3) have used an overpowering running game and a stingy defense to get back into contention in the ultra-tough NFC West. The task doesn’t get any easier with a game coming up Sunday at Seattle against the first-place Seahawks. But the 49ers believe the way they responded from the 43-17 loss to Miami two weeks ago bodes well for the future. “I think that’s just what we needed, that wake-up call to really spark a fire underneath us and get that sense of urgency back because we know what we’re capable of,” linebacker Fred Warner said. “That wasn’t who we were that week and obviously we’ve been able to put back-to-back performances on where we played dominant defense so we’ve just got to keep it going, stay humble and put our nose to the grindstone once again.” WHAT’S WORKING Running...

The Senate voted 52-48 Monday to confirm Amy Coney Barrett to the US Supreme Court, giving the court a 6-3 conservative majority that could determine the future of the Affordable Care Act and abortion rights.All Democrats in the chamber voted against Barrett's confirmation, as did Republican Susan Collins of Maine, who agreed with Democratic objections to confirming a justice so close to the Nov. 3 election.President Donald Trump and his GOP allies in the Senate pushed for a quick confirmation of Barrett, and it came just 38 days after the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who for 27 years anchored the court's liberal wing. Trump had said he wanted his replacement for Ginsburg in place to avoid a deadlocked court should the outcome of the presidential election depend on a ruling, as was the case in 2000.A White House swearing-in ceremony for Barrett is being planned for Monday evening with Justice Clarence Thomas set to administer the oath of office.The highly partisan vote on the confirmation mirrors the divisions in the country leading up to the election and on some of the issues that will be before the high court in the near future. Those issues include the validity of the Affordable Care Act and the status of the 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling that legalized abortion rights nationwide, as well as voting and civil rights.The court is scheduled to hear arguments on the ACA, the law known as Obamacare, a week after the election. The Trump administration is urging the court to declare the law invalid, including its protections for people with pre- existing conditions.The Mississippi attorney general, meanwhile, has pitched the court to take up her state's ban on abortions after 15 weeks in a case that could sharply limit Roe and for the first time let states outlaw the procedure before a fetus becomes viable.Trump has said he wants the justices he's selected for the court -- there are now three of them -- to invalidate Obamacare and overturn Roe v. Wade.The court is already addressing pre- election skirmishes over the rules for casting and counting ballots in the contest between Trump and Democrat Joe Biden.Just last week, the court deadlocked 4-4 on how many days Pennsylvania could wait after Election Eay for mail-in votes to arrive, leaving in force a three-day extension for the receipt of absentee ballots in the pivotal state. Barrett could provide the fifth vote to overturn any state court ruling that expands voting, or otherwise favors Democrats.The court also is scheduled to hear arguments Nov. 30 on Trump's attempt to exclude undocumented immigrants from the 2020 census, a case that could determine the allocation of House seats and federal dollars.Barrett, 48, has served on the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals since 2017 and taught at Notre Dame Law School. In three days of testimony during her confirmation hearings, Barrett stressed she would be independent, while asserting she had no agenda but to follow the Constitution and the law. She deflected questions on how she might rule on issues such as abortion, despite having the clearest anti-abortion record of any nominee in decades.Barrett's nomination so close to the election and the rapid confirmation process drew an angry response from Democrats, who pointed to the refusal of Senate Republicans to even give a hearing to President Barack Obama's nominee, Merrick Garland, to fill a vacancy that arose in February 2016 because it was an election year.While the number of justices has been set at nine since 1869, that experience and the Barrett nomination has ignited a campaign by Democratic activists to expand the court in retaliation, though that idea hasn't been embraced by Biden or Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer.Biden has said he would appoint a commission to consider court reform, while Schumer has said everything would be on the table next year if Democrats take back the Senate.Republicans have long seen court battles as a key motivator for turning out their base, and Republican senators including Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham of South Carolina are pinning their re-election hopes in large part on their successful efforts to shift to the courts to the right.They won't have to wait long see whether their efforts bear fruit at the ballot box.

For the second straight year, the Edina High boys soccer team has won its last game of the year.
 The prize last fall was the State Class AA championship trophy. This year’s prize is also a trophy - for winning Section 6AA.
 “Ideally, we would have had the opportunity to defend our state championship,” Edina head coach Dave Jenson said after the Hornets beat Eden Prairie 3-0 for the section title Saturday, Oct. 24 at the Braemar Dome. “We had a shorter season [due to COVID-19], so we let the section championship be our goal.”
 The Hornets waltzed through the section tournament without giving up a goal. Senior goalkeeper Hank Stechmann had a lot to do with that. His play was flawless in a 4-0 win over Jefferson in the opening round, and again in a 2-0 win over Minnetonka in the semifinals. Sixth-seeded Eden Prairie scored upset wins over No. 3 Chaska and No. 2 Shakopee to reach the title match against No. 1 Edina, but that is where the Eagles’ dream of a championship ended.
 “We are a young team with only four seniors, and I wish we could have won the championship for them,” Eden Prairie head coach Rob St. Clair said after Saturday’s game. “I’m not thinking about next year yet. We’ve really grown up this year, and it was a great accomplishment to make it to the finals in a very tough section.”
 Edina’s championship performance Saturday limited the Eagles to three shots on goal, one of which Stechmann rose above the crowd to catch.
 “Their goalkeeper is the best in the state,” St. Clair said. “And the way Edina’s defenders played today, it was hard to even test him.”
 Stechmann complimented Eden Prairie on its postseason success. “I wasn’t at all surprised to see them make it to the finals,” he said. “They have a great team. I love the Braemar Dome because it’s a bit wider field, and that gives us a chance to play.”
 “Winning the section title is the best we could have hoped for with no State Tournament this year,” said Henry Rose, one of four Edina captains along with Stechmann, Matt Mason and Ryan Swanda. “I am extra happy because we played so well as a team today.”
 After the game and the awards ceremony, Rose, Stechmann and Khoi Nguyen put on their Halloween costumes - white NASA space suits. They’re not going to Disneyland - they’re headed for the moon.
 “Our senior leadership is phenomenal,” coach Jenson remarked. “Coming into today’s game, everyone stayed grounded. We couldn’t take Eden Prairie for granted. They gave us a battle twice during the regular season, and I knew Rob [St. Clair] would have a good game plan.”
 Edina’s game plan was to use the whole field and make Eden Prairie chase the ball. “There were times when we linked 10, 15, 20 passes,” Jenson said. “We have so much depth this year. Guys like Johnny Buenz,Tommy Broderick and Paddy McGarvey come in and we don’t lose anything. I believe our technique is cleaner than any other team’s. The guys made use of the wide field and showed off their skills.”
 Edina led 1-0 at the half before putting the game away with goals from Matt Mason and Sammy Presthus in the second half. Mason scored his goal on a penalty kick and Presthus netted his goal from close range.
 After Presthus’ goal, coach Jenson and assistant coach Billy Garner knew it was time to put the reserves on the field. When the game ended, all of Edina’s starters, with the exception of Stechmann, were watching from the bench, wearing their anti-COVID masks.
 “It’s a credit to our team to win two years in a row in this section,” coach Jenson said. “Year after year, you’ll see five teams from the Lake Conference and in this section ranked in the state. Hank had a great season, and we didn’t give up a goal in the section. It’s kind of a bummer to end the season with no State Tournament, but everyone feels good about winning the section championship.”
 Coach Garner agreed: “That was a convincing win. It would have been great to have the opportunity to defend our state title.”

In fact, Cain got dismissed from one of the lawsuits on the basis that the DMCA notices were all sent by the publisher. That's kind of a big deal.

Earlier this week, Goldman Sachs announced it would give workers up to half a day off to vote, paid, for the first time. Other companies that have offered paid time to vote in the past, including Citi and Gap, have announced that they’re providing additional paid hours if needed as well as voter-education resources this year.
 The extra hours are likely to be necessary given that a record turnout is expected this year, which could mean long lines and additional safety procedures in light of the pandemic. In anticipation, Diageo North America, which owns brands like Guinness and Smirnoff, is changing course and allowing employees to take whatever time they need to vote without a written request. Previously, employees were given up to two hours of paid time off to vote, which they had to request in advance. The company also plans to set up a team for workers to call if they run into any trouble casting their ballots, said Laura Watt, its executive vice president of human resources.
 Some companies are hoping to encourage voter turnout in general. Shake Shack is giving away free french fries to customers who vote early. Tory Burch, the clothing label, designed a T-shirt that reads “VOTE,” the proceeds from which go to a nonpartisan get-out-the-vote project called I Am a Voter. Coca-Cola dispatched a team of marketers to create public-service announcements on the importance of early, in-person voting that ran on radio and television and at bus shelters around its home state of Georgia; broadcast spots featured the voices of Ed Bastian, chief executive of Delta, Atlanta Hawks forward Cam Reddish and other local celebrities.
 Corley Kenna, who runs communications at Patagonia and co-founded Time to Vote, took advantage of additional benefits her employer is providing this year to work at election sites in Atlanta, her hometown, with two colleagues. Between morning and afternoon shifts at the State Farm Arena and the Southwest Arts Center this month, she caught up on work.
 “I think it is on all of us — the private sector, nonprofit, academia — to help provide safe and secure elections,” said Kenna, a Democrat and environmental advocate who was a senior adviser in the State Department under President Barack Obama.
 Old Navy, the biggest brand owned by Gap, said it would pay employees to be poll workers, on top of what they get paid by county election commissions. The retailer said it hoped its policy would fuel voter turnout among its young store staff, more than 60% of whom are between the ages of 18 and 29. Levi’s extended its paid time off for voting to poll worker training this year and has been featuring environmental and racial justice activists on its Instagram account to talk about voting.
 The push by retailers and restaurant chains is significant because it can be especially difficult for hourly workers to find time to vote. After health care, retail is the second-biggest private sector employer in the United States.
 Still, not every company is being so proactive. Workers at Amazon, who have been pushing unsuccessfully for a paid day off to vote, are threatening to shut down warehouses temporarily Oct. 31 if the e-commerce giant doesn’t meet their demands. And on Thursday, Vote.org, a digital platform that helps people register to vote online and provides information about polling sites, called on more than two dozen companies that have not yet committed to giving workers time off to do so. It cited Pew Research Center statistics from 2014 showing that in the past, 35% of registered voters didn’t vote because of work or school conflicts.

Boston Police said an arson investigation is underway and released surveillance images of a person near the ballot box at that time, urging the public to help identify the individual.
 Officers called to the scene saw smoke coming out of the box before firefighters managed to extinguish the fire by filling the box with water, police said.
 The FBI said in a statement announcing their investigation that "it is a top priority of our offices to help maintain the integrity of the election process in Massachusetts by aggressively enforcing federal election laws."
 Voters can go online to see whether their ballot was processed. Those who used that dropbox between Saturday afternoon and 4 a.m. Sunday and can't confirm the status of their ballot online should contact the Boston Elections Department immediately, officials said.
 Voters whose ballots were affected can either vote in person or by a replacement ballot that will be mailed to them, officials said. If those voters don't submit a new ballot, "their original ballot will be hand-counted to the extent possible," Galvin's office said.

Bank of America is offering employees up to three hours of paid time to vote this year. The spirits company Diageo North America has declared a no-meeting day Nov. 3. Best Buy is closing stores until noon that day, and PayPal is offering a half day, paid, to workers who volunteer at polling places.
 Less than two weeks before the general election, corporate America is having a civic awakening, with thousands of companies encouraging voter participation by offering their workers paid time off, voter-education tools and interactive sessions on how elections work. Some are even providing marketing and free legal advice to local election boards or nonprofit get-out-the-vote groups.
 “Companies can’t do everything, but we can function in civil society in a way that really helps to encourage and enable civic participation,” said Franz Paasche, head of corporate affairs at PayPal, where the efforts have varied from paid time off to hosting a speaker series on elections.
 Two years ago, when executives from PayPal, Patagonia and Levi Strauss founded Time to Vote, a nonpartisan project that asks companies to encourage workers to participate in elections, there were around 400 members. In recent weeks, membership has shot up to more than 1,700. A similar initiative, called A Day for Democracy, has attracted more than 350 companies since it began with seven Boston-area companies in July. ElectionDay.org, sponsored by the nonprofit organization Vote.org, has gathered pledges from more than 800 companies promising employees paid time to vote.
 Most companies are quick to say that their goal isn’t to wade into politics or get any particular candidate into office. Rather, many executives say that they were galvanized by recent upheavals that have put issues of race and gender discrimination, economic inequality, climate change and other topics at center stage for employees and customers, and voting is a way to take a stand.
 “The Black Lives Matter and the civil unrest has been a call to arms for CEOs in terms of informing corporate behaviors and civic actions,” said Peter Palandjian, a private-equity executive in Boston who started A Day for Democracy with commitments from the Red Sox and Bank of America. “And I think that’s what’s very different this year.”

However, confiscating illegal dirt bikes is one thing.
 The street-legal cars and motorcycles are another.
 Combined in one weekend, Clapprood noted, “Eleven citations and two criminal complaints.”
 Clapprood said those citations could result in fines of $100, but the criminal complaints, city officials said, are sent to the Registry of Motor Vehicles. Officials there could call the reported noisemaker in for an inspection to ensure their mufflers and exhaust aren’t violating safety standards.
 “In an essence, we’re trying to save them from getting hurt too, but they want to be in your face. Whether you’re walking, whether you’re in a vehicle, a police officer, they don’t care. They’ll go right at the vehicle,” said Springfield Mayor Domenic Sarno.
 As for why the problem is getting worse, Clapprood noted, “My guess is pandemic exhaustion, time on their hands. People are out creating their own entertainment in their own environment and unfortunately, for one segment, this means ‘How can we drive the police crazy?’”
 Dirt bikes are illegal on the city streets, police said, because their soft tires are not meant to grip asphalt like they are soil, which leads to safety problems like sliding into traffic.
