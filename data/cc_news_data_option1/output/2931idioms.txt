We agree with you that the timing is not right.
 Although seeking to avoid printing and distribution costs on Monday and Tuesday makes quite sound economic sense, to leave those readers most comfortable with a print-only experience without the convenience of a printed newspaper during a resurgence in the pandemic leaves us a bit weak-kneed. At this time, we’ve decided to stay the course and to continue to deliver your news, both in print and digital form, in the way that we have.

Little wonder that Saturday’s press conference did not turn out to be the celebratory coming-of-age event that it was meant to be. One where PM Lee would take a back seat as the 4G leaders hogged centre stage and fielded questions about the future direction of party and country. Instead, the mood was as sombre as at the PAP press conference after the results of GE2020.

For the Jags, all of their big signings are likely out of the way this year so their current cap number might not move much. However, they do have a few candidates for new extensions in Cam Robinson, D.J. Chark (who will be on Year 4 of his deal), and whoever the Jags decide to keep between pending free- agents receivers Dede Westbrook, Chris Conley, and Keelan Cole. With the projected amount the Jags have for 2021, they should be able to keep three of those names if they earn extensions. They also might have room for at least one or two big-time free-agent, but again, that's if they would like and they don't make a big signing this season.
