Mumbai The Bombay high court has imposed a cost of ₹5 lakh on an educationist who had sought directions to the state to bear the cost of treatment for all Covid patients across all hospitals in the state. The court observed that it was preposterous to seek such directions at a time when the entire nation was struggling to combat and contain the spread of the virus.A division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice K K Tated, while hearing a couple of public interest litigations (PIL) filed by Sagar Jondhale, an educationist and Sarika Singh, a resident of Kurla was informed that the May 21 government notification which stipulated that 80% of beds in private hospitals was insufficient to alleviate the problems of a common man as they could not afford the cost of treatment. The petitions had prayed that the government should be directed to provide free-of-cost Covid-19 treatment at all hospitals, including private institutions, across Maharashtra. Advocate Anand Jondhale for Sagar Jondhale and advocate Varsha Jagdale for Sarika Singh had argued that though the notification had requisitioned 80% of beds in private hospitals and nursing homes for treatment of Covid-19 patients in the absence of any clear orders on the charges that the hospitals could recover from patients was resulting in profiteering by the said private hospitals. The advocates submitted that the notification allowed the hospitals to charge separately for pharmacy and pathology services which were affecting the patients, hence sought the notification to be declared null and void. In light of these submissions, the petitioners sought directions to the state government to provide free-of-cost Covid-19 treatment to all citizens in all hospitals, including private institutions, except to those who are covered by insurance schemes. Advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni along with government pleader Poornima Kantharia, however, submitted that due to the magnitude of Covid cases, the prayers of the petitioners were unfounded as the state could not be expected to pay for their treatment. Kumbhakoni further submitted that the state was taking all measures to ensure that testing and treatment for Covid was available to everyone, hence the demand for free of cost treatment by the petitioners was misplaced and the PILs should be dismissed with costs. After hearing the submissions, the court observed that as the demands of the petitioners were frivolous and preposterous. Hence, the court dismissed the PIL filed by Jondhale and directed him to deposit ₹5 lakh with the state government as costs. The court then asked Singh whether she wanted to withdraw her PIL and posted the matter for hearing on June 19.

The council is considering a new package of police reform measures, including putting complaints against officers online. They come in response to the death of George Floyd.But earlier Tuesday, council members debated an issue everyone thought was already settled.The council reignited the debate over where Memphis police officers should be allowed to live. Last December, they opted to let voters decide whether to allow police officers to live outside Shelby County, in any neighboring county or within 50 miles.On Tuesday, Councilwoman Michalyn Easter-Thomas, District 7, introduced a resolution in the public safety committee to remove the referendum from the ballot this November, calling it “dangerous.”“This referendum has the looming power to undo everything this city is fighting for in accountability and reform in local policing,” said Easter-Thomas.That set off a spirited 90-minute debate.“Councilwoman Easter-Thomas brought up danger,” said Councilman Worth Morgan, District 5. “Danger is what’s occurring right now on the streets of Memphis. I think we are failing to serve the people we represent, and it would almost, almost be better for the state to come in and preempt us on this issue because of a failure of leadership, and I don’t say that lightly. I really don’t.”The council is going back and forth over what Memphians really want from police.“The way the general public speaks is not on their Twitter account, they speak at the polls,” said Councilman Chase Carlisle, Super District 9-1.“There are plenty of people in our city that cannot vote,” said Easter-Thomas. “Almost three out of four houses I knocked on last year had people living within them that were not able to vote. However, I heard their voice.”In the end, the effort to rescind the referendum failed by a vote of 7-6. For now, it remains on the ballot this November.Copyright 2020 WMC. All rights reserved.",

"Siete piu informati di me, pero il consiglio e finito poco fa. Non posso commentare una cosa che non ho letto, se non qualcosa di molto stringato. Non possiamo fare altro che leggere i documenti formali, mi risulta che il CTS abbia comunicato, oggi o ieri, al ministro Speranza quello che e l'intervento di cui avete scritto negli ultimi giorni. Partirei dall'analisi dei testi, mi sembra che la notizia sia che e stato comunicato il verbale del CTS in cui c'era questa importante apertura. Noi non chiediamo un trattamento diverso, ma facciamo notare che, se fosse vero quanto riportato in queste ore, non esiste nessun Paese al mondo, tranne l'Italia, in cui esiste una previsione cosi stretta rispetto alla quarantena di squadra. Questo potrebbe penalizzare le nostre squadre anche a livello di coppe europee. È una previsione irrazionale, rispetto alle regole che ci sono state imposte. Mi auguro che questo tema, all'interno delle indicazioni del CTS, possa essere superato, perche il rischio che vi sia un caso puo sempre avvenire e tutto lo sforzo fatto da un sistema che ha saputo darsi regole piu strette rispetto a qualunque altro spettacolo e giusto che venga premiato. Non vogliamo regole diverse, ma oggi il calcio in Italia e svantaggiato rispetto a tutti gli altri Paesi del mondo".
