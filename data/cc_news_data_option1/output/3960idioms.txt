With our new awareness of mental health and the number of suicides connected to reality TV totting up around the globe, can shows like Big Brother really survive? ‘Well I just did Australian I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out of Here!, and they did the kind of checks that Big Brother never did.’ Although he lasted just eight days, and was grateful to be eliminated after suffering ‘extreme hunger’ in the camp, ‘I had multiple consultations before I was allowed on the show. I spoke to a therapist when I was there, and I’ve spoken to a therapist three times since leaving the show. That’s what should be being done across the board, especially on shows like Love Island where multiple people have taken their own lives.’ He shakes his head. ‘So many young people want to be famous, and they think it’s going to be rainbows and sunshine all the time.

Katherine (Katie) Grantham Taylor died the morning of September 28, 2020 in her home in Boulder, Colorado with her husband Norm Taylor at her side. She fought for many months with a rare form of uterine cancer. Katie was born September 4, 1941 in Lakeland, Florida, the second eldest child of Jesse Grantham, Jr. and Mary Porter Short Grantham. Her grandparents on her father's side were Jesse Grantham and Marie Canova Ward Grantham of Douglas, Georgia. Her maternal grandparents were Jordan Puryear Short and Linda Hollingsworth Short of Tifton, Georgia. In 1942 she moved with her family to the Philadelphia, PA area where her father was employed by the Curtis Publishing Company. She attended primary and secondary schools in Broomall and Newtown Square, PA., and later attended the Southern Seminary Junior College in Buena Vista, Virginia, majoring in business. The school is now known as the Southern Virginia University. In 1969 she married Leslie Bethel Holland of Philadelphia and the couple operated the Rittenhouse Travel Agency for many years. In succeeding years the couple lived in Chestnut Hill, Haverford, and West Grove, PA.. Following the sale of the travel agency Katie was employed for many successful years with American Management Association. Mr. Holland died in 2011 in West Grove. In 2012 Katie moved to Boulder, Colorado, to be near her daughter, Caroline Bethel Holland, and grandchildren, Ellia and Alex. In 2014 Katie married Mr. Norman Taylor of Boulder. The couple had a wonderful 7 1/2 years together. They traveled extensively to warmer climates in the winter months, and spent the summer months visiting national parks and hiking and camping in the Rockies. Katie and Norman were regular supporters of the Lions Club in Boulder and were members of the St. Mary Magdalene Episcopal Church in Gunbarrel. She had the wonderful ability to easily meet new people wherever she went and her life was filled with great laughter and friendships. Gardens, dogs, family, and surrounding herself with all were her favorite pastime. She had an incredible eye for decorating, and she and her older sister Linda were avid collectors of antiques, a hobby they picked up from their parents. Her homes were always warm, inviting and interesting. She was an avid reader of Maine Antique Digest, The New Yorker, and The Smithsonian. Katie came from a family of avid swimmers, and she and her siblings continued to be avid swimmers throughout their lives. Her daily lap swims at the Boulder Recreation Center were never to be missed. Her father and mother were co-founders of the Marple-Newtown Swim Club in Broomall, PA, and her father was one of the first presidents of the Suburban Swim League in Philadelphia. Her gardens were always beautiful, there were always dogs underfoot, and her doors were always open for family reunions and holiday gatherings. Katie is survived by her husband Norm Taylor of Boulder, a daughter, Caroline Holland also of Boulder, two grandchildren, Ellia and Alex Osofsky, a brother, Jesse (Katherine) Grantham of Ojai, California, and 6 nieces and nephews.

 But Central City (18-10) wasn’t done. The Bison put up five runs over the fourth and fifth innings to close to within 7-5. Faith Carroll and Karlee Seitz drove in runs, and the Bison also took advantage of GICC errors to plate four unearned runs.

Another Muskogee voter, De McBride, said news about Trump contracting the novel coronavirus could make some voters think twice before supporting the president’s re-election bid.
 “Up until now he was seen as either reckless or invincible when it came to the COVID-19 virus,” McBride said, responding to a query posted by the Muskogee Phoenix on social media. “He was seen jetting from place to place without a mask and without fear. Now that he has the virus many may feel that he isn’t Superman and he is just as venerable (sic) as the rest of us.”
 McBride said Americans “like to believe that our presidents are super-humans” while in reality “they are humans just like each voter.” Regardless, she hoped voters look “to deeds when it comes to this election.”
 McBride said the president supported many businesses during this pandemic and credited “his direction” for keeping her “small childcare open and operating throughout this crisis.” She said many parents were able to continue working, and while state officials failed to distribute funding for child care providers as intended, “they were there.”
 While sentiment among voters appears mixed, Motta said he believes the way the White House handled information about the pandemic damaged public trust. He said that could prove problematic going forward.
 “If the president says he’s doing well, there will be people who won’t believe it,” Motta said. “If the President says he’s doing poorly, there will be people who don’t believe it.”
 He said the most important thing now would be to provide clear, concise and reliable information about what’s “going on in the White House right now.”
 “The more sources we have saying the same thing, the more likely people are to trust what’s going on,” Motta said.” That’s very important.”

The Sacred Heart Alumni are also hosting their bicycle rally at 8 a.m. Saturday, she said. Registration for that event is underway. It was moved after the chamber's Germanfest was canceled in April because of the coronavirus. Germanfest is a three-day festival hosted by the chamber the last full weekend in April.
 Registration for the bike rally will be accepted until the morning of the event and registrations were carried over for those who signed up to participate at Germanfest, Palmer said.
 If mornings aren't your thing, don't worry. The tapping of the keg isn't until noon Saturday, according to the chamber. The stein hoisting competition is at 7 p.m.
 “Last year we had almost 60 participants,” Palmer said. “Pretty impressive.”
 At 8 a.m. Sunday, a 5K and half marathon will take place. Anyone interested can signup that morning, Palmer said.
 At 2 p.m. Sunday, the “famous wiener dog races” are slated to begin.
 Throughout the weekend, attendees can enjoy a variety of food — including German — and watch an array of live performances.
 “Our event is cultural,” Palmer said. “I feel like when you bring your children there they'll get to experience things as a family, whether it's trying out a new dish that maybe normally wouldn't eat and watch a performance to get educated.”
 She said she strives for a family-oriented experience where children might listen to some Polka music “to hopefully fill their hearts.”
 “Our entertainers can't wait to be up on stage to perform,” Palmer said, while adding she is blessed to have sponsors to keep the event going. “For the chamber, we're just excited to have this event for our community because all our organizations benefit from this.”

CENTRAL CITY — Adams Central’s defense was in pass coverage all night long.
 While the Class C-1 No. 3 Patriots gave up a Class C-1 record 42 completions to Central City junior Kale Jensen, they never gave up a deep pass. And after the first series of the game, didn’t give up a touchdown in a 21-8 victory Friday night at Preferred Popcorn Field.
 “We wanted them to go nickel-and dime us down the field and our corners did a great job of not letting them get over the top,’’ Adams Central coach Shawn Mulligan said. “We didn’t give up any big plays the whole entire night and I think that really helped our confidence of saying you got to go 10-plus plays to score on us and we have a solid defense.”

ORLEANS -- You can't judge a book by its cover but can you judge a town by its book shops?
 In Orleans there has been COVID-related turnover this summer. The Booksmith and Musicsmith closed for good on Sept. 5, coincidentally the same day Sea Howl Bookshop opened in the space where Main Street Books operated for 16 years.
 The Booksmith, operated for the last quarter century by Matt and Cherry Reid, had been in business for 40 years, first at Skaket Corners by Shaws and the last six years in the Staples plaza.
 Greg's Used Books remains in its downstairs location behind Westies on Main Street. Annie's Book Stop on Route 28 is closed for the summer of 2020 due to the virus. It's usually open seasonally.
 Main Street in Orleans has had a book shop for decades. All through the 1980s and 90s it had two; the Compass Rose bookstore was located directly across the street from where Main Street Books was and Sea Howl now is.
 "We leased the empty space July 1, from the owners (Don Krohn and Janice Brennan) who chose to wind it down [but] wanted it to stay a bookstore," recalled Jonathan Nedeau, who owns the Sea Howl store with his wife Kazmira. "We heard through a friend they were transitioning out of this store and we opted to lease."
 Krohn and Brennan still own and operate the Whole Food Store, which occupies the same building as Sea Howl.
 "It's all new," Nedeau said of his shop. ""We've expanded some sections; home and garden, cooking, poetry and philosophy. We have more university presses. We have a lot of classics from the 19th and 20th century. We're having a good September so far. Everyone who comes in is overjoyed and wishes us the best. We feel the support from everybody."
 It officially opened on Sept. 5, and business was brisk last Saturday as customers walked in and browsed. Nedeau said he hoped to have author signings and use the outdoor patio space once they get settled. They have a used book rack out front.
 He's new to the bookstore business but had worked at M.I.T. in the press and journals division.
 "I've been in academia a long time," he said. "I was a Ph.D. dropout in philosophy. I grew up in Barnstable and went to Barnstable High School. I was away 20 years. I came back to the East Coast and worked in Boston and New York. I married in 2015. My wife is from Brooklyn.
 "We were both working and I was commuting off Cape. I was doing finances for a business. So I figured with my accounting background, my wife was in marketing and communications and worked at Outer Cape Health, we were both COVID layoffs spending time with a 2 year old at home. We heard [about the store] through the grapevine and approached Don."
 So they leased the space, added new counter tops, shelves, a new awning, computer software, and set up a website.
 "People can order anything not in stock," he said. "[The store name] Sea Howl is from the Dry Salvages, one of the four quartets of T.S. Eliot. It was as hard as picking out a baby's name."
 "We always said it would be wonderful to own a bookshop," Kazmira Nedeau added. "Something about books brings people together. It's a space where you can talk about ideas. Jonathan enjoys poetry and gardening. We both enjoy non fiction. I studied anthropology."
 They hope to partner with organizations such as lifetime learning at the library, book clubs, the historical society, the conservation trust's speaker series, and they'll ask local businesses for book recommendations in their areas of expertise.
 "We just want to be thoughtful in all the stuff we select, all of the inventory," she said. "Every section has something pertaining to racial justice and inequality and we try to select items they might not see. We've gotten such a good response from the community, they can't believe we have the book they're looking for."
 Book selling is difficult in the age of Amazon. Stores have to differentiate themselves.
 If you want old books you can find them at Greg's Books. He's been open six years, two years at the current location. The shop specializes in used books, retro video games, movies, sci-fi and fantasy. The used book section covers a wide range of topics: nature, gardening, history, biography, literature and the tomes tend to be higher quality volumes.
 "The shutdown was annoying to me. It probably cost me 10 grand," Greg Elfers reflected. "I was closed and paying rent."
 He tried to get some funding from the CARES Act for small business, and his business is small, but despite lots of time on the phone was unsuccessful.
 "This is my second year down here. My ultimate goal is to get to Main Street or Route 6A. or just to be able to put the time and effort in to keep afloat," he said. "If I had employees or partners I'd have to file bankruptcy."
 As it is the shop is a one-man operation.
 "I worked for Tim's Used Books in Provincetown before, so I built up my inventory for 10n years, got a spot and got open. I've been buying books for 15 years. The only difference is putting in the time and moving the books into it. The overall inventory gets better every year. I've got movies, board games, video games. I've got something for everybody. A lot of quality product in nice condition. I don't have any filler. When something sits too long it goes to a local free rack."
 The used book business isn't easy; it isn't a gold mine either.
 "If you want good inventory you have to pay for it," Elfers said, "I like what I do. It's year six. I haven't made any money yet but it does get a little better each year, if it wasn't for the shutdown and also having to pay rent. But Amazon is not a threat to me. I look at most competition as a positive. It keeps it in peoples minds that you can still buy books. I look at someone else's shop and see I have to up my game. I don't think I'd want to be the only shop in town."
 He believes the book business has a future in Orleans.
 "As long as you put the time and effort into what you're doing you're going to have some success," he reflected. "The only pitfall is when you let yourself get offended by other people and when you're too honest, you can pay a price for that."

The runner-up last year and in 2018, both times to Rafael Nadal, advanced to the fourth round for the fifth consecutive time, with another straight-set victory in this week's first encounter in Paris between seeded men.
 The victim of the third-seeded Austrian's fierce backhand and super-quick court coverage under the new roof on Court Philippe Chatrier was No. 28 Casper Ruud, who lost 6-4, 6-3, 6-1.
 Long after early bird Thiem was done, Nadal also marched on in his pursuit of a 13th French Open title and record-tying 20th major overall. His opponent, Stefano Travaglia, was among five Italian men in third-round play, an Open Era record at a Grand Slam. But he proved no match for Nadal's overpowering clay- court game. Nadal was on court for just 95 minutes, winning 6-1, 6-4, 6-0.
 Sebastian Korda, Nadal's next opponent, is the 20-year-old son of 1998 Australian Open champion Petr Korda. Korda and his third-round Spanish opponent Pedro Martinez reached the main draw via the qualifying tournament. Korda won 6-4, 6-3, 6-1 to become the first qualifier to reach the men’s fourth round since Alejandro Falla in 2011.
 The 2015 champion, Stan Wawrinka, fell to French wild card Hugo Gaston, who wrapped up the 2-6, 6-3, 6-3, 4-6, 6-0 win with spectators' cries of "Hugo! Hugo!” ringing in his ears. Ranked 239th, Gaston next plays Thiem.
 In the women's draw, top-seeded Simona Halep defeated Amanda Anisimova 6-0, 6-1. The 19-year-old Anisimova had beaten the 2018 champion in straight sets in the quarterfinals last year.
 Halep, riding a career-best winning streak of 17 matches, will next face another rematch against another teenager: Iga Swiatek.
 Thiem, bidding to become the first Austrian with multiple Grand Slam titles, has said he loves the chilly autumnal conditions that other players have grumbled about at this pushed-back French Open.
 Still, waking up in the players’ bio-secured hotel at 7 a.m. for the first match on Chatrier, he was taken aback that dawn had yet to break, as it would have done in May.
 "Everything dark. Winter is almost coming,” he said. "That was a little bit weird.”
 Thiem was broken only once, when he sent a forehand wide to give Ruud a 3-1 lead in the first set. He immediately broke back and converted six of his 15 break points in all. He also saved seven of the eight break points he faced.
 Ruud was bidding to become only the second Norwegian to reach the fourth round of a Grand Slam.
 The first was his father and coach, Christian Ruud, in 1997 at the Australian Open. He watched on Friday on Chatrier.
 It was again largely empty for that match, a result of the daily limit of 1,000 spectators imposed on the clay-court Grand Slam tournament. The arena built for 15,000 rang out later in the day to shouts of "Bravo!” and "Merci!” and saw fans in face masks jumping up and down in waves as Caroline Garcia of France beat 16th-seeded Elise Mertens 1-6, 6-4, 7-5.
 "There are not many of you but you make as much noise as when it’s full," Garcia told the crowd, which sheltered under the arena's new roof from a storm that interrupted play on outside courts. The 45th-ranked Garcia advanced to face third-seeded Elina Svitolina, who beat the last of 12 Russians in the women's draw, Ekaterina Alexandrova, 6-4, 7-5.
 Halep also played her third-round match in the dry under the Chatrier roof to set up her rematch against the 19-year-old Swiatek.
 In the fourth round last year, Halep routed Swiatek 6-1, 6-0, ending the Polish player's Roland Garros debut.
 Swiatek is a tougher prospect this time. She has lost only 13 games, not dropped a set and beat Canadian wild card Eugenie Bouchard 6-3, 6-2 in the third round.
 Swiatek hit 30 winners and converted six of her 13 break points against the 2014 Wimbledon finalist now ranked 168th.
 Halep is among several players who say they've returned reinvigorated, rested and with a new mindset from the pandemic-forced break that shut down the tennis tour for much of the year. Others have said the months-long hiatus was bad for their game.
 "I became very relaxed,” Halep said. "I saw that the bigger problems are in normal life, not in our sport. So we have the privilege to play these beautiful and great tournaments.”

One big--though not surprising--trend to emerge from the list: Tech towns are seeing a big boom, especially in the heart of the tech industry, California's Bay Area. San Jose holds the number one spot on the list and San Francisco comes in at number five. In San Jose, home values are projected to rise nine percent this year, and have appreciated 78 percent over the past five years.

 He can’t say it, but the Heat simply have no chance without two of their three best players, Goran Dragic sidelined with a foot injury and Bam Adebayo out with a sore shoulder.
 Meyers Leonard, who had appeared in just one playoff game for all of nine minutes, replaced Adebayo in the starting lineup. Tyler Herro, who at age 20 became the youngest player to start a Finals game, replaced Dragic. They combined for seven baskets.
 Yeah, the Heat were pretty much short-handed, but they actually led in this game. Seriously. Three minutes into the game they were up 8-6.

"My injury did not come from [the Spanish Fly]... An injury from the Spanish Fly could have been worse. Thank goodness that the injury came later and not from the Spanish Fly," Garza revealed. "In the Spanish Fly, I landed on my neck. I was not standing fully right on the ropes and Montez Ford launched himself when I was still not fully planted on the rope. It was a matter of moments that my mind went like, 'Spin' and that's the result that you saw [at Clash of Champions]."
 Garza then confirmed that he actually suffered the tear during the exchange with Montez Ford. He heard a small pop, felt the heat from the tear, and told the referee that he could not continue. Garza explained how he then tagged Andrade and told him the same thing. He also talked about interacting with WWE's medical team.
 "Unfortunately, the injury came afterwards. Montez went for a kick and I grabbed the kick. When I lowered it, I went for the knee, but I put in a little too much force into it. I thought when I was going to do it, [Ford] was a little too far from where I was and I didn't measure myself properly. When I tried to stretch my leg towards him, the other leg that was supporting it couldn't handle it and was stretched out too much," Garza explained. "That's when I heard a small pop, like a balloon exploding. Everything around that area started to get really hot and when I tried to move the leg, I had that tension close to my groin and it was my quadriceps, almost reaching my hip. That's what I felt. The referee came to me and asked if I can continue and I said no.
 "I remember giving Andrade the tag and he asked me what's wrong and I tell him that I can't go anymore. WWE has a system that's really effective where they have all the doctors and medical personnel watching the matches on monitors and they quickly go to the ring to see what's going on. I told them what I was feeling. The medical team sent me away to get it checked. I was asked if I could walk and I said yes, but couldn't put any force down there."
 Garza noted that the MRI came back this week and the tear isn't as serious as it could've been. He's already undergoing treatment and will not need surgery. It was also noted that if all goes well he expects to be out of action for 7-15 days, but it could be 3 weeks before he's back, meaning he could be back in action before the end of the month, if not for the WWE Draft edition of RAW on October 12. Garza also talked about how doctors said that if he would've continued in the match, he could be facing up to 6 months out of the ring with a more severe injury.
 "They told me to get an MRI and I got the results and thankfully, it wasn't anything involving the tendons or with my hip as some outlets have reported. It was a quad tear and we already began treatment. I've been putting ice on it and bandages for the tear. Right now, I just came from an evaluation and we have been advancing through it incredibly," he said. "Thank God I just started to feel good. I still have more evaluations to do, but if all goes well, I think I might be out from a week to maybe 15 days.
 "Thank God that it wasn't anything long-term like five or six months. They told me if I had continued, I could have completely torn [the quad] and would have been out for a very long time. I don't think it will even be a month to fully recover... I'm not going to be needing surgery, I'll probably be only out for a week to three weeks since the injury."
 Stay tuned for updates on Garza's status.

After quarterback Kamron Sandlin capped a 45-yard drive with a 1-yard run, Roberts broke a 42-yard scoring run 55 seconds before the half was to end. The Wildcats were forced to attempt a punt but a low snap gave Anniston the ball at the White Plains 19-yard line. A false start moved the ball back 5 yards but Sandlin completed a 24-yard scoring strike to Kevontae Davis with 12 left in the half.
 A 24-yard run by Sandlin and a 9-yard keeper by reserve quarterback Jayden Lewis earned Anniston a 48-14 lead midway through the third quarter.
 Anniston snapped the ball to Roberts, blocking back in punt formation, twice in the final four minutes of the third quarter and each time the Wildcats denied a first down.
 The Wildcats roared back with touchdowns in the fourth quarter.

ORLEANS -- The Cape is experiencing a boom in the rental home market this autumn, as more visitors embrace the region as a safe harbor, relatively speaking, compared to wherever they're coming from.
 According to the online rental outlet weneedavacation.com, which markets 3,000-plus homes on the Cape and Islands, fall bookings on the Cape have so far rose 60 percent compared to last year; 51 percent on Martha's Vineyard and 34 percent on Nantucket.
 The company attributes the spike to home-based education options for students and remote working opportunities for adults.
 This phenomenon is coupled with the influx of people who arrived last spring, during the first surge of the pandemic, many of whom are still here, and a new marketing campaign the Cape Cod Chamber of Commerce has launched, called Second Summer. It all adds up to a much more crowded Cape than locals are accustomed to at this time of year.
 The marketing campaign urges potential tourists from the Commonwealth and farther afield to take advantage of the Cape's warm autumn waters, walking and biking trails, outdoor dining (while the weather holds), golf courses, museums that have reopened and other of the region's attractions.
 Chamber CEO Wendy Northcross, talked about the campaign in a late summer media briefing of the Cape Cod Reopening Task Force, saying that her organization has done fall marketing in the past, but this year -- as the region works to recover from the impact of COVID-19 -- is the first time that a Cape-wide approach is being deployed.
 "It is our second-most productive season to promote and talk about and offer up, so we're very pleased that we can this year," Northcross said. "If we ever needed it, this is the year that we need it."
 Early signs point to a fairly robust fall season unfolding amid the overall downturn. Some seasonal businesses that might traditionally have closed in September are instead staying open through October, maybe November, Northcross said.
 Jim Russo, executive director of the Eastham chamber, told The Cape Codder that he's all in on the campaign.
 "I believe the Cape Cod Chamber's Second Summer is spot on. It is targeting the demographic that is most suited to casual vibes of 'slightly' off-season traffic, allowing ease with reservations and spur-of-the-moment drop-ins for dining and entertainment all with the benefit of the warm sunny days, low humidity and all within a distance of a single tank of gas," he said.
 Along with other local chambers, the Eastham organization has joined the regional effort, he said, and the partnerships "will bring a cohesive and united strength for the campaign's success."
 Other members of the Cape Cod Reopening Task Force also predicted a busier shoulder season.
 "We expect to have a sustained population increase, I would say at this point through the winter, whether it be folks who have second homes here who are able to work remotely and are deciding to stay here and also for our seasonal workforce," said Sen. Julian Cyr (D-Truro).
 Cyr said he hopes the economic impacts of the pandemic will prompt Beacon Hill to recommit to supporting the tourism industry, describing the pre-outbreak spending levels on tourism promotion as "a pretty paltry sum."
 "I really think that coming out of the pandemic, we need to do a much better job here in Massachusetts in actually providing meaningful resources for tourism promotion," Cyr said. "We are getting walloped by our competitor states and localities. Frankly, it really shows the strength of what we offer in Massachusetts that we continue to have such a robust tourism economy with so little investment from the commonwealth."
 The outlook for Cape businesses, which rely heavily on seasonal travel, is cautiously optimistic.
 In an ongoing survey of employers the Chamber of Commerce and Cape Cod Commission are conducting, 52 percent of respondents said their revenues this year have dropped by about half and another 22 percent said their revenues dropped by more than three-quarters.
 Still, officials said that the latest survey reflects improvement compared to the springtime peak of the virus.
 About 35 percent of the 370 area businesses that responded to the survey projected that they can last for at most six months based on current cash flows and reserves. That rate, while still substantial, is down from the 45 percent who said they could keep operating for six months maximum in a similar survey last April.
 Nearly two in three now say they anticipate operations returning to normal in about six more months, a perspective that Cape Cod Commission Executive Director Kristy Senatori, who participated in the briefing with Northcross and Cyr, called "a really positive sign for the region."
 "There's a little bit more of a positive feeling in the community about business operations and continuity," Senatori said.

 “It just leaves us kind of nervous that we’re not out of the woods yet when it comes to what might happen in California,” said Jonathan Cox, a deputy chief with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, known as Cal Fire.
 The easing winds proved a mixed blessing at the Glass Fire in Sonoma and Napa counties. Although the fire raged on, crews got a break as they struggled to keep flames from jumping containment lines and renewing their march toward scenic communities.
 “The good news is that with the lack of wind, we didn’t have continued control issues,” said Ben Nicholls, a Cal Fire division chief.

One of baseball’s most uncompromising competitors, the two-time Cy Young Award winner spent his entire 17-year career with St. Louis and was named the World Series MVP in their 1964 and ’67 championship seasons. The Cards came up just short in 1968, but Gibson was voted the National League’s MVP and shut down opponents so well that baseball changed the rules for fear it would happen again.
 Gibson died less than a month after the death of a longtime teammate, Hall of Fame outfielder Lou Brock. Another pitching great from his era, Tom Seaver, died in late August.
 “I just heard the news about losing Bob Gibson and it’s kind of hard losing a legend. You can lose a game, but when you lose a guy like Bob Gibson, just hard," Cardinals star catcher Yadier Molina said. "Bob was funny, smart, he brought a lot of energy. When he talked, you listened. It was good to have him around every year. We lose a game, we lose a series, but the tough thing is we lost one great man.”
 At his peak, Gibson may have been the most talented all-around starter in history, a nine-time Gold Glove winner who roamed wide to snatch up grounders despite a fierce, sweeping delivery that drove him to the first base side of the mound; and a strong hitter who twice hit five home runs in a single season and batted .303 in 1970, when he also won his second Cy Young.
 Baseball wasn't his only sport, either. He also starred in basketball at Creighton and spent a year with the Harlem Globetrotters before totally turning his attention to the diamond.
 Averaging 19 wins a year from 1963-72, he finished 251-174 with a 2.91 ERA, and was only the second pitcher to reach 3,000 strikeouts. He didn’t throw as hard as Sandy Koufax, or from as many angles as Juan Marichal, but batters never forgot how he glared at them (or squinted, because he was near-sighted) as if settling an ancient score.
 Gibson snubbed opposing players and sometimes teammates who dared speak to him on a day he was pitching, and he didn’t even spare his own family.
 “I’ve played a couple of hundred games of tic-tac-toe with my little daughter and she hasn’t beaten me yet,” he once told The New Yorker’s Roger Angell. “I’ve always had to win. I’ve got to win.”
 Equally disciplined and impatient, Gibson worked so quickly that broadcaster Vin Scully joked that he pitched as if his car was double-parked.
 Ball in hand, he was no nonsense on the hill. And he had no use for advice, scowling whenever catcher Tim McCarver or anyone else thought of visiting the mound.
 “The only thing you know about pitching is you can’t hit it,” Gibson was known to say.
 His concentration was such that he seemed unaware he was on his way to a World Series single game strikeout record (surpassing Sandy Koufax’s 15) in 1968 until McCarver convinced him to look at the scoreboard.
 During the regular season, Gibson struck out more than 200 batters nine times and led the National League in shutouts four times, finishing with 56 in his career. In 1968, thirteen of his 22 wins were shutouts, leading McCarver to call Gibson “the luckiest pitcher I ever saw. He always pitches when the other team doesn’t score any runs.”
 He was, somehow, even greater in the post-season, finishing 7-2 with a 1.89 ERA and 92 strikeouts in 81 innings. Despite dominating the Tigers in the 1968 Series opener, that year ended with a Game 7 loss — hurt by a rare misplay from star centre fielder Curt Flood — and a rewriting of the rules that he would long resent.
 Gibson’s 1.12 ERA in the regular season was the third lowest for any starting pitcher since 1900 and by far the best for any starter in the post-dead-ball era, which began in the 1920s.
 His 1968 performance, the highlight of the so-called “Year of the Pitcher,” left officials worried that fans had bored of so many 1-0 games. They lowered the mound from 15 to 10 inches in 1969 and shrank the strike zone.
 “I was pissed,” Gibson later remarked, although he remained a top pitcher for several years and in 1971 threw his only no-hitter, against Pittsburgh.
 Gibson had a long major league career even though he was a relatively late bloomer and was in his early 30s in 1968. Signed by the Cards as an amateur free agent in 1957, he had early trouble with his control, a problem solved by developing one of baseball’s greatest sliders, along with a curve to go with his hard fastball. He knew how to throw strikes and how to aim elsewhere when batters stood too close to the plate.
 Hank Aaron once counselled Atlanta Braves teammate Dusty Baker about Gibson.
 “Don’t dig in against Bob Gibson; he’ll knock you down,” Aaron said, according to the Boston Globe. “He’d knock down his own grandmother if she dared to challenge him. Don’t stare at him, don’t smile at him, don’t talk to him. He doesn’t like it. If you happen to hit a home run, don’t run too slow, don’t run too fast. If you happen to want to celebrate, get in the tunnel first. And if he hits you, don’t charge the mound, because he’s a Gold Glove boxer.”
 Only the second Black (after Don Newcombe) to win the Cy Young Award, he was an inspiration when insisting otherwise. Gibson would describe himself as a “blunt, stubborn Black man” who scorned the idea he was anyone’s role model and once posted a sign over his locker reading “I’m not prejudiced. I hate everybody.”
 But he was proud of the Cards’ racial diversity and teamwork, a powerful symbol during the civil rights era, and his role in ensuring that players did not live in segregated housing during the season.
 He was close to McCarver, a Tennessean who would credit Gibson with challenging his own prejudices, and the acknowledged leader of a club which featured whites (McCarver, Mike Shannon, Roger Maris), Blacks (Gibson, Brock and Flood) and Hispanics (Orlando Cepeda, Julian Javier).
 “Our team, as a whole, had no tolerance for ethnic or racial disrespect,” Gibson wrote in “Pitch by Pitch,” published in 2015. “We’d talk about it openly and in no uncertain terms. In our clubhouse, nobody got a free pass.”
 Cardinals pitcher Jack Flaherty, who is Black, grew close to Gibson in recent years. The right-handers would often talk, the 24-year-old Flaherty soaking up advice from the great who wore No. 45.

If you wear noise-canceling headphones, chances are you've been totally oblivious to coworkers calling your name. Or, more seriously, risked missing important sounds--like car horns--while out and about.      But Amazon's forthcoming gadget might change all that. Amazon is proposing a set of noise-canceling headphones designed to listen to outside noises and mute sound when it hears certain trigger words, like your name or a doorbell. Any audio playing through the headphones would then stop to allow you to hear what's going on around you. It's unclear if users will be able to customize the trigger words or if the headphones will come with a default set of words. Regardless, the gadget makes important strides, especially towards addressing any safety concerns noise-cancelling headphones pose while worn outside.

Station residents will test it out for a few months. If the shakedown goes well, the toilet will be open for regular business.
 With SpaceX now launching astronauts to the space station and Boeing less than a year from sending up its first crew, more toilets are needed. The new one will be in its own stall alongside the old one on the U.S. side of the outpost.
 The old toilets cater more toward men. To better accommodate women, NASA tilted the seat on the new toilet and made it taller. The new shape should help astronauts position themselves better for No. 2, said Johnson Space Center's Melissa McKinley, the project manager.
 “Cleaning up a mess is a big deal. We don’t want any misses or escapes,” she said.
 Let’s just say everything floats in weightlessness.
 As for No. 1, the funnels also have been redesigned. Women can use the elongated and scooped-out funnels to urinate while sitting on the commode to poop at the same time, McKinley said. Until now, it’s been one or the other for female astronauts, she noted.
 Like earlier space commodes, air suction, rather than water and gravity, removes the waste. Urine collected by the new toilet will be routed into NASA’s long-standing recycling system to produce water for drinking and cooking. Titanium and other tough alloys were chosen for the new toilet to withstand all the acid in the urine pretreatment.
 Going to the bathroom in space may sound simple, but “sometimes the simple things become very difficult” without gravity, said NASA astronaut Mike Hopkins, commander of the second SpaceX crew, due to launch Oct. 31 from Kennedy Space Center.

Tras la finalizacion de la I Guerra Mundial, la decada de los años 30 del siglo pasado acogeria un nuevo periodo fatidico dentro de la historia con la promulgacion del odio racial a traves de creencias politicas radicales, promovido por una serie de desalmados dictadores que llevaron a la humanidad hasta limites de sufrimiento jamas vividos con anterioridad. El mundo entero llegaria a tambalearse.
 Pero mientras los cimientos de la maldad y del odio al projimo iban creciendo paulatinamente en aquellos años, la gente encontraba un hilo de esperanza y entretenimiento a traves del futbol. Tras la disputa del mundial de Uruguay en 1930, Europa acogeria la segunda edicion de aquel novedoso torneo, que precisamente, buscaba confraternizar a traves del deporte a las distintas naciones participantes en el evento.
 Pero cuando se lleva veneno en la sangre, resulta imposible encontrar la armonia, como asi ocurriria en la organizacion, desarrollo y culminacion del Campeonato Mundial de Futbol de 1934, adjudicado -en una decision ciertamente cuestionable por parte del comite organizador- ni mas ni menos que a «Il Duce» Mussolini, que veria en ello el elemento propagandistico ideal para exaltar su regimen totalitario. No solo bastaba con organizar la Copa del Mundo, sino que Italia debia ganarla como fuera.
 -«No se como hara, pero Italia debe ganar este campeonato», le espeto Mussolini a Giorgio Vaccaro, presidente de la Federacion Italiana de Futbol.
 \- Haremos todo lo posible...
 \- No me ha comprendido bien, General€ Italia debe ganar este Mundial. Es una ¡¡¡orden!!!
 Los expertos de la epoca señalaban a la España de Zamora, Quincoces y Langara y a la Austria de Sindelar -en ausencia de la actual campeona Uruguay- como las dos grandes favoritas al titulo. Pero Benito se empeño en que no fuera asi.
 A diferencia que en el primer Campeonato en el que se formaron grupos para dilucidar los clasificados para la lucha por el titulo, en este se fijaron eliminatorias directas desde un primer momento. 16 fueron las selecciones participantes: doce europeas, tres americanas (Argentina, Brasil y Estados Unidos) y Egipto.
 A las primeras de cambio las selecciones americanas quedaron fuera de la competicion, destacando la victoria de España por 3-1 ante la Brasil de Leonidas en Genova. Italia, por su parte, se deshacia con comodidad de Estados Unidos por 7-1. Los dos equipos latinos debian enfrentarse en los cuartos de final. España era claramente superior, pero se encontro con un obstaculo con el que nadie contaba. Florencia seria la sede del gran duelo italo hispano el 31 de mayo de 1934. Minutos antes del pitido inicial, el colegiado belga Louis Baert recibiria en su caseta, cortesia de Mussolini, la visita de un cotejo de matones para advertirle de que Italia «si o si», deberia pasar a semifinales.
 España se mostro enormemente superior a su rival durante el desarrollo de los 90 minutos, de hecho, Regueiro puso por delante a la furia en el minuto 31. Tras infringir el reglamento en numerosas ocasiones, los italianos alcanzarian su proposito al filo del descanso, cuando un balon colgado al area fue rematado por Ferrari al fondo de las mallas, mientras Schiavio agarraba de forma descarada a Zamora, -de las pocas imagenes que se guardan de aquel mundial, una de ellas es la de la clara infraccion sufrida por parte de «El Divino»-. En el palco, «Il Duce» se frotaba las manos.
 En la segunda mitad los argentinos nacionalizados Orsi y Monti, se dedicaron a repartir de lo lindo y los jugadores españoles fueron cayendo uno a uno victimas de la dureza de los italianos. Un par de goles anulados y varios penaltis no señalados culminaron con una de las actuaciones mas deplorables y bochornosas de la historia, en cuanto a la labor arbitral se refiere, dejando sin sancion el juego sucio y barriobajero azurro que acabaria con nada mas y nada menos que siete lesionados en las filas españolas. Zamora, Ciriaco, Fede, Lafuente, Langara, Gorostiza y Iraragorri, no pudieron disputar el partido de desempate.
 Al dia siguiente y con las mencionadas bajas en el 11 titular, España de forma heroica a los mandos del gran Jacinto Quincoces, se dejo hasta la ultima gota de sangre para honrar a nuestra nacion. Pero las bajas, nuevamente la agresividad de la dupla italo-argentina, y como no, la nefasta actuacion arbitral, hicieron que La Roja cayese con honores por 1-0, con gol del mitico Giuseppe Meazza, a pesar de que el italiano Demaria estaba obstaculizando a Nogues, portero que sustituia al lesionado Zamora, con dos costillas rotas. Nuevamente dos goles legales fueron anulados por inexistentes fueras de juego, a Regueiro y Quincoces.
 En semifinales, Austria sufriria de la misma medicina que España y caeria ante la anfitriona «viciada» por 1-0. Igual suerte correria la Republica Checa en la final al perder por 2-1.
 Benito Mussolini habia logrado su proposito, ganar a cualquier precio su Mundial. Pero para los mas romanticos del futbol, la realidad reflejo que España habia sido claramente la vencedora moral.

The stakes seem to always be high for Carver Boys Soccer, and with the group of players returning to the team, they have plenty of reason to be excited for what this season has to offer. That being said, the one primary emotion running through the team right now is gratitude.
 "I am more happy that we're out on the field playing than I am upset that it's not what it normally looks like," head coach Mark Alessandri said.
 Alessandri is coming off a season where he won EMSCA Coach of the Year as he led his Crusaders to a 14-5 regular season and a tournament appearance, where they fell to the Cohasset Skippers.
 Despite seeing Hayden Roche, CJ Vincent, and Andrew Ferari - three crucial team leaders - walk across the graduation stage this summer, Carver headlines 12 seniors, one of the biggest senior classes in program history.
 "We go into every year looking for the same thing. We obviously look for the experienced players to provide leadership and provide assistance to younger players, but we kind of talk to them every year about the fact that we look for every player to be a leader. You don't have to be a captain or a senior to be a leader," Alessandri said, "Losing what we lost from last year, it's a lot of experience. But, we have a lot coming back. This is the biggest senior group we've had in a long time."
 High-scoring forward duo Mike Sawiki and Dominic Craig will likely tally the most points for the Crusaders this season, but one of the biggest things for the team this year is how well-rounded the team is. Sophomore Ryan Vincent fit in well a season ago, the goalie platoon of Justin Ritz and Brandon Weygand showed its effectiveness, and seniors like Codan Foley and John Dishaw put their heart into the game as well. It's a testament to how versatile a team Alessandri has on his hands, and it's a team he looks forward to coaching.
 "I think we have a situation where we have some flexibility. We have some people who can play multiple positions, it gives us flexibility if we want to change the formation. It's going to be one of those things where, what works best for us under the circumstances? We've had seasons before where we play multiple formations, we've had seasons where it's one formation for every single game. We've had consistent lineups, but we've also moved things around so the emphasis is going to be on flexibility," he added.
 Because of COVID-19, the MIAA has integrated a few new wrinkles into the 2020 season to ensure every player, coach, and official's safety during the course of play. Players wearing masks during practice, on the bench, and while playing in games is one of the more concentrated ones. Coaches and referees will follow the same instruction. The guidelines state that if it is violated during a game, it will inevitably result in an indirect free kick for the other team as well as a yellow card for the player in violation. Intentional body contact during a game will come with its repercussions. Alessandri commented about the new layers to the game, acknowledging that it will take time to get used to them.
 "Going through every situation when something comes up that's a new rule: stop, explain it, remind it. We have to go through it like that," he said, "Learning to play with a mask on has been more of an issue, (but) the new rules will take care of itself. I think there will be times where someone will forget and head the ball and something along those lines, but for the most part, it's more just doing the safety stuff and still thinking about the idea of playing soccer."
 The idea of playing soccer isn't too far from coming to fruition for Alessandri and company as they look forward to kicking off the action with a home scrimmage against Mashpee on Friday, Oct. 2.

Researchers using passive acoustic recordings of whale calls to track their movements found that four of the six baleen whale species found in the western North Atlantic Ocean -- humpback, sei, fin and blue whales -- have changed their distribution patterns in the past decade, spending more time in northern latitudes.
 This could be do to shifting prey and warming waters, a recent study by Northeast Fisheries Science Center in Woods Hole suggests.
 The recordings were made over 10 years by devices moored to the seafloor at nearly 300 locations from the Caribbean Sea to western Greenland.
 "All four whale species were present in waters from the southeast U.S. to Greenland, with humpbacks also present in the Caribbean Sea," said Genevieve Davis, a senior acoustician at the science center and lead author of the study.
 "These four species were detected throughout all the regions in the winter, suggesting that baleen whales are widely distributed during these months. Humpback, sei, fin, and blue whales also showed significant changes in where they were detected between the two time periods considered in this study: before and after 2010."
 The study is the first to show the occurrence of these four species across the western North Atlantic Ocean over long time spans and at a large spatial scale. The study also demonstrates how whale distributions have changed over time, and in particular since 2010.
 Data collected from 2004 to 2014 on 281 bottom-mounted passive acoustic recorders totaled 35,033 days of recording. They were deployed between the island of Saba in the Caribbean Sea to the Davis Strait off western Greenland. Recorders were located on the continental shelf or along the shelf edge, with six recording units in off-shelf waters.
 All available passive acoustic recordings from more than 100 research projects throughout the western North Atlantic Ocean were combined to create the decade-long dataset. The time series was split between 2004 to 2010 and 2011 to 2014. That split was based on the timing of shifts in climate in the Gulf of Maine and distribution changes by numerous species in the western North Atlantic Ocean.
 This is also the same time period used in a similar analysis of North Atlantic right whales that was published in 2017, and used for comparison with this study.
 Results show that fin, blue, and sei whales were more frequently detected in the northern latitudes after 2010 but less on the Scotian Shelf area, southwest of Nova Scotia. This matches documented shifts in prey availability in that region.
 "The Gulf of Maine, an important feeding ground for many baleen whale species, is warming faster than most places in the world, resulting in changes in distribution not only of marine mammals and fish but also for their prey," said Davis, who was also the lead author of the 2017 North Atlantic right whale study.
 "These changes in distribution for five of the six baleen whale species mirrors known shifts in distribution for other species attributed to climate and the impacts of ocean warming."
 Researchers have not yet studied if or how minke whale distribution has shifted. Minkes are the sixth baleen whale species found in the western North Atlantic Ocean.
 While humpback whales are found in all regions, researchers were a bit surprised at the length of time they are present in all areas. Fin, blue, and sei whales increased the time that they spent in northern latitudes after 2010, perhaps following prey. All but sei whales had a decreased acoustic presence on the Scotian Shelf after 2010.
 Sei whales, one of the least-studied baleen whales, were detected with the other whale species from Florida to eastern Greenland. Sei whales are found year-round in Southern New England and the New York Bight. These are also important regions for other baleen whale species, including North Atlantic right whales that target the same prey as sei whales.
 "This study is the first comprehensive analysis of sei whale distribution throughout the western North Atlantic Ocean, including their movements and important habitat," Davis said. "The southern limit of their range remains unknown, and their migratory movements in the western North Atlantic are still not well understood but we have filled in a number of information gaps."
 Fin whales were detected nearly year-round from Virginia to eastern Greenland. They are commonly found year-round in the Gulf of Maine and in Canadian waters off Nova Scotia. Acoustic records revealed their year-round presence in Massachusetts Bay and the New York Bight.
 New England waters provide feeding grounds, but mating and calving grounds are unknown. Their distribution year-round suggests that, like other baleen whales, not all fin whales migrate.
 Blue whales are seen and heard year-round in and around the Gulf of St. Lawrence, where their population is well-studied. Considered a more northern whale, they have occasionally been sighted in the Gulf of Maine. Acoustic detections revealed blue whales are present as far south as North Carolina.
 Blue whales tend to use deeper waters, making their seasonal movements difficult to study. Satellite tag studies, however, indicate they move from the Gulf of St. Lawrence to North Carolina, including on and off the continental shelf. They also move into deeper waters around the New England Seamounts --- a chain of underwater extinct volcanoes that extends from Georges Bank southeast for about 700 miles. Researchers found the shelf break and canyons to be important habitat areas for blue whales.

The LeBron James-Anthony Davis tandem has been so dominant for the Lakers this NBA postseason that it has led many in the sports talk world to ponder the question: Is Davis the best teammate ever to play with James?
 A few great players come to mind, with Heat legend Dwyane Wade at the top of the list. Wade was a superstar when James made "The Decision" to take his talents to South Beach; he already had an NBA championship and Finals MVP on his resume. Together, they made four consecutive Finals appearances and won back-to-back titles in 2012 and 2013, with Wade playing Robin to James' Batman. In those four seasons, Wade averaged 25.5, 22.1, 21.2 and 19.0 points per game.

The Titusville Police Department is hosting the first ever National Night Out at the Police and Fire Department, located at 323 N. Franklin St. on Tuesday, Oct. 6. from 5 to 7 p.m.
 Even though the event is hosted by the police department, other emergency services are participating in the event.
 Officer David Brooks, the officer in charge of the event, wanted to host this event due to the present climate of police community relations nationwide. “We want to show the community it isn’t us versus them,” said Brooks. “We are all community members as well, just because we wear this badge doesn’t mean we are any different.”
 Brooks noted that the mainstream media pushes news and agendas that don’t tell the whole story about law enforcement on a national scale.“I think our relations with the community are great” said Brooks.
 The event will allow the public to meet their first responders in a positive situation. The police department is trying to change the stigma associated with police interactions. “When people see the police, it’s because of something major, minor or tragic,” said Brooks. “We don’t want to be associated with bad and tragic.”
 Members of the community will be allowed to look around and interact with emergency response vehicles while asking questions to first responders. Members from the Titusville Fire Department, Ambulance Service and Shambaugh Towing will all be present at the event. Shambaugh towing assists emergency services with towing for car accidents and other emergencies.
 Brooks said that the bay doors of the fire station will be open, and that residents can take a tour of the police station, and even come see the cells.
 Brooks also wants this event to allow for residents to more easily interact with officers when they see them out and about. “The reason I went into law enforcement was to help people,” said Brooks. “I want people to know that if there is anything I can do to help them, that I’m someone that’s approachable.”
 Brooks loves when residents wave to him while he is in his squad car, and hopes it happens more as a result of the Oct. 6 event.
