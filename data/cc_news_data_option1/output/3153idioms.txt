If that were true, was he trying to buy back his life. On March 30, as reported in Maclean’s magazine, GW mysteriously picked up $475,000 in $100 bills at the Brink’s facility at 19 Illsley Avenue in Dartmouth. The money had been routed there through CIBC Intria, which normally stocks ATM machines and provides bulk currency for other transactions. The RCMP has said it was GW’s money, perhaps as part of an inheritance from an old friend, but the provenance of the money is unknown. Police sources say that if GW actually were a police informant or agent, the money could have been given to him by the police and, technically, at the end of the day it was in his name. The police have provided no clarity.

Robinson’s season could have turned out so differently had a move to AC Milan, to play alongside the infamous Zlatan Ibrahimvoic at the legendary San Siro gone through.
 “It was crazy. When I signed for Wigan, to be fair they said to me I had everything to kick on and develop and won’t be here for much longer than a year-and-a-half or two years,” he recalled.
 “It came really out of the blue, really quickly. Six months into my second season with them, a massive team comes in.
 “It’s the stuff of dreams, you don’t see people moving from a team in the (Championship) relegation fight going to one of the biggest teams in the world.
 “It was a mad one, a real emotional rollercoaster. I had like 15 days since I was linked with them in January, wondering what was going to happen.
 “They’d been in contact for a while. They’d been watching me for a long time but I wasn’t fully linked in the press until mid-January.
 “Then a day or two before deadline day, they said a fee had been agreed with Wigan and I’d be flying out tomorrow. It was 7 o'clock at night and I just had to pack a bag.”
 He continued: “It would have been the move of dreams. Moving away, abroad, at a really exciting time to go to a top-flight team.
 “I never got my chance at Everton, so for a top-flight team that I was a player they’d like to give a chance to, it was a really exciting time in my life. I was ready for the new challenge and had even started trying to learn Italian.
 “And then to finally get out there and think they’d find something wrong in the medical but never thinking it would be my heart. It was madness.”
 So why exactly did the move fall through?

HUNTINGTON, Texas (KTRE) - The Huntington Red Devils are back on the football field after ending summer strength and conditioning early.The district made the decision to close down early giving the kids a summer break to stay at home and isolate before the fall camp started. Now back together the team s ready to get to work.“It is a little different then what we are used to,” running back Hunter Mayes said. “We are trying to get used to it, have fun and go out and win some games.”The Red Devils are entering the 38th year of football at the Angelina County ,district. The school has only gone to the playoffs twice in 2018 and 2019. Huntington is hoping to get back for a third straight year. To do that the team will need to win more than one district game which got them to the post season the past two years. That will not be easy moving down from 4A DII to a tough 3A DI district.“We are the first group to go to the playoffs,” Blaine Terekell said. “We got that taste. We know what it is like to win. We are ready to compete.”First thing, first, getting through the fall camp. The coaching staff is doing all they can to make sure that happens.“We took an extra two weeks off this summer to be safe and try to put our kids in the best position to avoid this virus,” head coach Joshua Colvert said. “You have to maintain a level of safety if we want to continue to practice and play football. We are going to maintain social distancing as much as we can in football practice. We are going to keep our kids separated when we take a break. They have their own water jugs so there is no contamination possibility.”Copyright 2020 KTRE. All rights reserved.

Listening to the story of Robinson’s season, you can’t help but feel sorry for him yet admire how he’s stayed positive in the face of adversity.
 But it’s not been all doom and gloom.
 According to reports, he is on the verge of a return to the Premier League with Sheffield United believed to have had a £2m bid accepted for his services.
 And when speaking to the ECHO, he admitted he’d probably be moving on this summer and was looking forward to being able to focus on his football again, wherever that might be.
 “I’ll definitely have to consider moving on. Wigan need the funds and they’re going to sell whoever the most attractive players are.
 “I was already up for sale in January so hopefully that means I can kick on. If it’s the best for me, they’re going to let me go. But that’s out of my hands as well. If I’ve done well enough then someone comes in for me and it works for Wigan and myself. If not, I’ll crack on.
 “They (AC Milan) have kept watching me and they were great from when I had the testing on my heart. When I came back from the medical, I still had to have them at Wigan. They were really great at staying in touch and seeing how I was.
 “The main thing for me next season is I want to keep playing and keep doing well and performing. If it looks like I’m not going to start, it (Milan) might not be an option unless I’m not getting the offer to start elsewhere.
 “My goal next season, no matter where I am and what I’m doing, I just want to play. We’ll just see what happens.”
 Full of positivity despite the year’s setbacks, there could be even greater triumphs in store yet for Robinson with the defender firmly setting his sights on representing the United States at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.
 “I was unfortunate to miss out on the Gold Cup last summer. I’d have loved to have been playing,” he said. “That would have been my first international tournament.
 “I’m just waiting now, hoping I’ve done well enough to get called up and hopefully start when international football gets back underway.
 “I do want to play, I don’t want to be second-fiddle to anyone anywhere. It’s just not in my nature.
 “When it comes to World Cup qualifying, I’m desperate to win anything. I have my heart set on doing really well and that would be a dream come true, playing in the World Cup as well.”

Salmon easily outdistanced Ririe and West Jefferson in last year's district meet, leaving Firth back in fourth and that just isn't what Firth athletics is all about. The Cougars are winners and expect top performances from all of their athletes.
 Salmon parlayed that top district finish into a third place at state behind perennial state champions Soda Springs and Bear Lake.
 That is something that the Firth crew would like to see happen for them this year, but it will take some hard work and diligence in the process.
 If Robbins comes back strong, which she should, and they can get improvement from Madi Popwell and Nicole McKinnon, which is expected, then they can be the team that has a chance to upset Salmon. They will also need expected improvement from the younger group of ladies as well.
 The group of coaches at Firth have never been known to duck any opponent and often will schedule top notch foes in every sport.
 It is no exception for the cross country team, which has set up a very challenging schedule for this fall beginning with the Madison Dash, which will have its share of 4A and 5A teams lined up for the start of the season.
 This is the traditional starting point for the Cougars, who also have the Cardinal Classic at Soda Springs with the nationally ranked Cardinals in attendance and then the Tiger/Grizz meet in Idaho Falls will be next. That is three very difficult beginnings for the team, but it is also a building experience for a team that is measured with their excellence.
 The schedule will taper off slightly and heads toward the middle of October when they host the Firth Invitational and set themselves up for the District 6 meet which determines runners and teams for the annual state championships in late October.
 It all points to a very solid year for the Lady Cougars if things all fall in the right places for them and their runners.

At the start of 2019, the Firth Lady Cougars had a strong nucleus for a very good cross country team. Then disaster struck in the form of injuries.
 While injuries are a part of the game, the one that took out budding superstar Cassi Robbins -- she of the multiple gold medals at the state track and field championships -- was costly. The then-junior was expected to lead her team to a possible appearance in the cross country state championships and the Lady Cougars to a third straight 4x400 meter relay title last spring.
 We all know what COVID-19 did to those plans, but maybe, just maybe, it was a blessing in disguise.

BLACKFOOT – Coming off of the news from state leaders that the state will be bolstering funds to ensure that school districts across the state have the tools they need to meet the needs of their students in these unprecedented times, a Blackfoot school growth committee met to discuss how to better meet the needs of the students and community.
 Members of the committee came into the meeting with new information from an outside source that polled 100 patrons of the Blackfoot School District regarding the need of a new elementary school as well as the hope to re- purpose I.T. Stoddard Elementary into a Technical Education Center (TEC).
 The responses to the probe were a landslide in favor of doing some new construction in the community, and the voice supporting the TEC was even louder.
 Of the 100 patrons that were polled, 88 supported the new construction, with two voting against, and 10 who were neutral. The interesting factor provided was that one of the two that voted against the new construction and TEC left a comment afterward expressing major desire to see something like that for the town. Overall, all but one comment made was in support; most of the support surrounded the TEC.

“It’s definitely the worst way to go down. It’s unfortunate with the team going down and the financial situation when we know a lot of lads are going to be leaving. It’s a horrible way to break up a group of lads who really get on.
 “Every single lad was on the same page. No-one was thinking about themselves or not playing until the end of the season. Not even just before the 12-points deduction but when it came to contract renewals and people doing extensions. All the lads were just buying into it for each other and playing until the end of the season.
 “If you look at the whole season, we’ve dropped points plenty of times in games where we should have won or should have drawn and we’ve lost. The whole season just wasn’t enough and it’s obviously really tough.
 “I’m still devastated to be honest. For the second half of the season the whole team has been outstanding. I stopped playing at the end of January and didn’t play again until the lockdown return.
 “We went on an unbelievable run and to be relegated because of things happening out of control is a real blow. We couldn’t have done much more than we did.”
 Since speaking to Robinson, Wigan manager Paul Cook has left the club and Latics’ relegation to League One was officially confirmed after their appeal against their points penalty was rejected.
 And the defender is understandably disappointed by the whole affair with there being no escaping the fact that the entire football club has been let down, regardless of the complexity of the situation and where you point the blame.
