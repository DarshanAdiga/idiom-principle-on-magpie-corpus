It's not unusual for me to fail miserably at New Year's resolutions, which are always to maintain a decent weight, eat healthy food, exercise, and be kinder to others. I repeat the process during Lent, when I often hit a brick wall. I've been trying to get back on track with my keto diet since we rolled into 2020, but it hasn't been easy, especially with my new "regional editor" duties. The question is how long I can keep my husband on the same track.
 When a wife announces she's "going on a diet," a decent husband will offer to go along for the ride. Only a real horse's behind would expect a working woman to prepare two or three meals every day just so he could have his marbled steak and butter-and-sour-cream-drenched baked potato. With keto, the steak is OK, and so is the butter and sour cream. But the tater needs to go the way of the dinosaur, replaced with a hunk of cauliflower. I know, I know - but you'd be surprised how you can get accustomed to it, especially when you mash it.
 In any case, it's been my observation that most men start regretting their tandem diet pledges about the same time the first hunger pangs hit. At that point, they're willing to throw in the towel and replace it with a napkin stained with grease, ketchup and chocolate milk. Or in my husband's case, these Belgian waffle-looking round cookies with some kind of sticky substance in between that he picked up at Costco. You have to sort of tear them with your teeth, and they are surprisingly addicting.
 These days, the word "diet" is out of vogue. Instead, we aim for good nutrition - healthy eating habits we can keep for the rest of our lives. Most nutritionists tell us to close our ears to the keening wails of the corporate corn industry, which has given us high-fructose corn syrup - a product blamed for the scourge of "belly fat." But even without an expert to coach us along, common sense suggests opting for foods as close to their natural state as possible - these days, called "paleo" - is the best way to go.
 Eating right means shunning cheeseburgers and shakes; anything with a label bearing lots of ingredients you can't pronounce; sugary treats, like my famous pies, cakes, cookies and candies; an overabundance of starchy breads and pastas; and anything fried in "bad fat." And, for some purists, it means eschewing pork. On the keto diet, pork is fine and dandy, which is one reason my husband doesn't complain too much when we go for long stretches of keto. If bacon can be consumed, he's moderately tolerant.

Furkan Korkmaz scored a career-high 24 points, including a career-best six 3-pointers, to lift the host Philadelphia 76ers past the Chicago Bulls 100-89 on Friday. Furkan Korkmaz asked the Philadelphia 76ers 14 months ago to trade him somewhere he could play amid frequent shuttles back and forth to the club's G-League team in Delaware. On Friday night, he was a lifeline for a team that may have found an answer to its desperate need for outside shooting. Korkmaz had six 3-pointers and a career-high 24 points, and the 76ers beat the Chicago Bulls 100-89 Friday night. 'Everyone could see that I was really feeling it and trying to find me,' Korkmaz said. 'As a team, we had good open looks in moving the ball and we executed the game plan well.' Ben Simmons and Al Horford each scored 20 points for Philadelphia. Simmons had 11 rebounds and seven assists. Zach LaVine led Chicago with 23 points, while Cody White had 14 and Luke Kornet added 13. The Bulls struggled to hold onto the ball, turning it over 11 times in the second half as the game slipped away. 'I didn't like our discipline in the second half offensively,' Chicago head coach Jim Boylen said. 'There were too many turnovers. We had some opportunities and good looks in situations that we could capitalize with. We didn't get it done.' Korkmaz helped the 76ers take over in the third quarter after trailing 48-47 coming into the second half. He hit all four of his shots from deep in the quarter, allowing Philadelphia to surge ahead 81-71 at the end of the period. Philadelphia has been linked to virtually every available 3-point shooting trade target to fill the gap left when leading outside shooter JJ Redick left for New Orleans in free agency last year. On Friday, the 76ers were seeing if Korkmaz could give them that lift off the bench. Korkmaz finished 6 of 9 from 3-point range and was 8 of 11 overall. 'We were dusting off some of the plays that we used to run for JJ,' Sixers coach Brett Brown said. 'We ran five plays in a row to him. And he changed the game and gave us a spark.' 'It's all about reps in practice because JJ was making shots look easy,' Korkmaz said. 'At the end of the day, we're running those for me. And when I play with Ben, I feel confident because I know I will be open at the end of the set.' Early in the fourth, Korkmaz brought a big ovation from the sold-out crowd with an isolation drive and windmill dunk over Bulls forward Cristiano Felicio. Korkmaz's previous high was 21 points at Detroit on Dec. 21. 'JJ never did that,' Brown joked. Simmons had his third straight game with at least 20 points amid the absence of injured Joel Embiid. Tobias Harris added 13 points for Philadelphia, which improved to 20-2 at home. The Sixers are 7-14 on the road and have lost six straight as they leave Philadelphia for three straight games, starting Saturday night in New York. 'If I knew why, we would have fixed it,' Simmons said. 'We just have to keep working at it.' The club was hit with a technical foul for having six men on the court toward the end of the first quarter on a play that wiped out another Korkmaz 3-pointer. 'We were trying different rotations out tonight and Tobias [Harris] was still on the court,' Brown said. 'I'll take responsibility for that.' The Bulls said that due to weather concerns in Chicago on Friday night they were forced to spend an extra night in Philadelphia. They are scheduled to fly Saturday morning into the Midwest to play Saturday night's game against Cleveland. The Cavaliers were also unable to reach Chicago on Friday night after the game. Embiid's injured left finger has had a ripple effect on Philadelphia's plans in a lot of areas. One of the biggest could be the usage of 12-year veteran and 33-year-old Al Horford, who has seen his minutes go up from his time last year in Boston (31 per game this season as opposed to 29 with the Celtics) and up to 33.5 per game in the five games since Embiid was injured. It was believed the 76ers were going to ease Horford's regular season workload with an eye towards the playoffs. 'If you look at it, he may go up a little bit, but it's never a reckless amount,' Philadelphia head coach Brett Brown said before Friday's game. 'In regard to cutting our nose off to spite our face, that won't happen. We're very mindful of it.' Sixers will play at the New York Knicks on Saturday while Bulls will host Cleveland.

After the big question is popped and loving partners decide to spend their lives together as a married couple, a whirlwind of activity will ensue. Although wedding planning is exciting, some couples may feel overwhelmed with all the decisions that need to be made before they can tie the knot. In this state of increased pressure, stress may build and health could falter. According to a Cornell University study, more than 70 percent of brides-to-be have weight loss on the brain, but shedding pounds shouldn’t be the only health factor to consider. Here are some easy ways to stay mentally and physically fit in advance of a happy wedding day.
 • Get daily exercise. Exercise is important for maintaining a healthy body weight and keeping stress levels in check. Exercise also can boost mood. The Department of Health and Human Services recommends getting at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity each week. Strength training exercises performed at least twice a week complete a well-balanced exercise regimen.

 "Blood donation is extraordinary. It's just a small scratch on your arm compared to what it can do for someone else. I hope more men start giving blood in 2020."
 NHS Blood and Transplant has estimated they need 135,000 new blood donors each year to replace those who stop donating, and to ensure they have the right mix of blood groups to match patient needs.
 In particular, there is a vital need for more men in the East of England to start donating blood. NHSBT is aiming for 48 per cent of all new donors in the East of England to be male during 2020.
 Mike Stredder, head of donor recruitment, said: "All our donors are amazing. But we need more men to start donating blood in the east of England during the New Year. Men's blood can be used in extraordinary, lifesaving ways, but we don't have enough new male donors coming forward. This is not about recruiting as many donors as possible - it's about getting the right gender mix."

KL Rahul's significant contribution both with the bat and gloves in the second ODI against Australia has given birth to an idea. Can he be a long-term option as a wicket-keeper batsman to boost the balance of the side? Rahul was just filling in for the injured Rishabh Pant in Rajkot but comparisons have already been drawn with the great Rahul Dravid, who batted in the middle-order and kept wickets in more than 70 ODIs for the team's sake.
 Eventually Rahul's 80 off 52 balls made the difference as India won the high- scoring second ODI by 36 runs.
 The Karnataka batsman also effected Aaron Finch's stumping besides taking two catches off pacers Jasprit Bumrah and Navdeep Saini respectively. Though former India opener Aakash Chopra feels that Rahul is a better wicket-keeper than what Dravid was in his playing days, he feels the right-hander should not be given the dual responsibility.
 "He is a better keeper than what Dravid was but I would not want him to keep on a regular basis. Keeping takes a toll. He can't be keeping for 50 overs and then batting higher up the order," Chopra told PTI ahead of the series decider here on Sunday.
 "If somebody who is that good (with the bat) and if he can do another job, it doesn't mean that he should keep as well. Rahul is too precious a talent for me to slot in as a keeper batsman. That way, instead of managing his workload, you are increasing his workload.
 "Once in a while if he has to keep for the team balance it is okay but in the longer run you have to allow him to score 10000 runs and that won't happen if he is being asked to keep," added Chopra.
 Before the series, it seemed there was a toss up between Rahul and Shikhar Dhawan to partner Rohit Sharma at the top. However, skipper Virat Kohli, who has always shown a lot of faith in Rahul, accommodated both in the eleven, the latter playing at number three spot in Mumbai and five in Rajkot.
 Former India wicket-keeper Nayan Mongia is also of the view that Rahul can't be the number one choice behind the stumps, at least in ODIs.
 "He can be a good second wicket-keeper. He cannot be a permanent wicket-keeper in ODIs. T20s it is still okay but not in ODIs. There should be a regular keeper but he can be a second option," Mongia said.
 "You need to have a specialist keeper anyway, Rishabh is there for that. Yesterday was just a chance to try Rahul out and he did reasonably well."
 If Rahul does keep regularly, it does give Kohli the option of playing two all-rounders instead of one at the moment. Hardik Pandya, who is currently recovering from an injury, and Ravindra Jadeja can both play if Rahul is behind the stumps.
 "His (Rahul's) batting will be affected if he is a regular keeper. He is more important to the team as a batsman than a wicket-keeper batsman," added Mongia.
 Rahul himself has shown a lot of flexibility in the series, first with the bat and then putting his hand up for keeping. But like he said, "anyone" would do it for the Indian team.
 "More than willing to bat anywhere and do any job that the team wants. It is not just me, anybody who is playing for the country will be willing to take up anything," Rahul said after the Rajkot victory.
 On his keeping experience, he added: "It is (a challenge). Even for me, sometimes I couldn't pick Kuldeep and Jadeja. At the pace he (Kuldeep) bowls it is just pretty difficult, it is not what I get in my first-class team. I am just enjoying what is thrown at me and trying to do the best I can."

ThisDay | Iraq News Now)- Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Friday his government will give Canadian $25,000 (US$19,122) to the families of each of the 57 citizens and 29 permanent residents of Canada who died in the downing of a Ukrainian jetliner in Iran last week, Times of Israel reported.Trudeau said he still expects Iran to compensate the families but added that they need help now for funerals, travel to Iran and bills.      He said any money Iran provides at a later date will go straight to the families and will not be reimbursed to the Canadian government.“I want to be clear, we expect Iran to compensate these families,” Trudeau said.      “But I have met them.      They can’t wait weeks.      They need support now.”Asked if the United States bears any responsibility after US President Donald Trump ordered the killing of Gen.      Qassem Soleimani, Iran’s top general, in an American airstrike in Baghdad, Trudeau said Iran bears full responsibility for having shot down a civilian airline with 176 people aboard.The prime minister also said the “black boxes” have been significantly damaged and Iran does not have the expertise or equipment needed to look at them.      He said France has a lab that can do it.      He said there is a need to do it as quickly as possible.The spokesman for the French accident investigating bureau, or BEA, said it has no information about eventually obtaining the demolished airplane’s black boxes, the voice and data recorders, to decipher them.      Sebastien Barthe added that it is up to Iran, which is in charge of the investigation, to decide the matter.Trudeau said no remains of Canadian victims have returned to Canada yet but he expects that to start happening in the coming days.Trudeau held the news conference in Ottawa after Canadian Foreign Minister François-Philippe Champagne met his Iranian counterpart, Mohammad Javad Zarif, in Muscat, Oman on Friday.

 In reply, Australia lost David Warner, who scored an unbeaten hundred in the first ODI, in the fourth over.

Quasi 170 mila iscritti (un numero in continua crescita) accomunati dalla voglia di affrontare con soluzioni concrete la pressione fiscale. È questo il biglietto da visita del gruppo Facebook 'Partite Iva insieme per cambiare', iniziativa social che mira a unire in un'unica voce tutti i titolari di Partita Iva italiani. Lavoratori autonomi, imprenditori, commercianti e artigiani, pronti ad opporsi a quanto previsto nel 2020 per il loro settore dalla manovra finanziaria del governo.
 Secondo un report di Unimpresa, nel nostro paese la pressione fiscale è più alta rispetto a tutte le altre nazioni europei con il carico fiscale che supera il 64% del fatturato. Numeri che complicano la vita dei commercianti, sempre più in difficoltà nel mantenere aperte le loro attività. Ed è per questo che Giuseppe Palmisano, titolare di un negozio al centro di Monopoli (provincia di Bari), ha deciso di dare vita al gruppo Facebook che ha sin da subito ottenuto un boom di consensi iniziato con la decisione di spegnere simbolicamente le insegne dei propri negozi per protestare contro una situazione per molti oramai non più sostenibile. L'idea partita dalla Puglia ha trovato consensi in tutta la penisola (anche la Liguria e la Provincia di Savona seguono con interesse gli sviluppi di questa protesta) e così ecco svilupparsi sui social un gruppo il cui direttivo ha stilato un decalogo di elementi da discutere durante le riunioni.
 Dalla riduzione della spesa pubblica alla lotta alla burocrazia, senza dimenticare la riduzione del prelievo fiscale e contributivo e l’abolizione del pos obbligatorio: tanti i temi sul tavolo, con al vaglio iniziative per creare punti di riferimento del gruppo per ogni regione italiana. Le partite Iva d'Italia, dunque, non ci stanno e provano ad unirsi per cambiare lo scenario che li attende per l'anno appena cominciato.

Funding was provided to create a community coalition and follow a framework that incorporates prevention efforts aimed at changing or influencing community conditions, standards, systems and policies.
 3\. You and your husband Mark, a retired associate district judge, have three kids. How has your family influenced your work with the coalition and other projects you undertake?
 Mark and I, through our work and in our own family, saw firsthand the effect that drugs and alcohol has on so many life decisions. Science showed that telling kids to “Just Say No” wasn’t preventing them from smoking, drinking and using other drugs. What was working, however, was beefing up protective components in communities – i.e., controlling access, developing policy, etc.
 4\. What are some of the challenges Tahlequah faces from your viewpoint as BEST director? How about its strengths?
 Years ago, the challenge was to get all the main players in the same room at the same time and get everyone working strategically, and not in silos. The main stakeholders in our community are TPS, Cherokee Nation, city of Tahlequah, Northeastern State University, Northeastern Health System, Tahlequah Police Department, Cherokee County Sheriff’s Office, Cherokee County Health Department and Cherokee County Health Services Council, which includes the Healthy Living Program and our state representatives and senator. I am proud to say everyone listed is involved with the coalition and has a vested interest in implementing strategies that promote protective factors in our local environment to assist youth in making healthy decisions. What once was our biggest challenge is now our biggest strength. All the main players are in the room and on the same page.

Bordeaux mixture can be prepared at home as and when required. Farmers can prepare it on their own and use it when required. In order to produce Bordeaux mixture, one kilogram of powdered copper sulfate is dissolved in 50 liters of water in a mud pot or plastic bucket. Mud pot or plastic bucket is used so as to avoid contact of the mixture with any metal surface, as the mixture can poison it. Next, one kilogram of lime is dissolved in 50 liters of water. The copper sulfate solution is poured into this lime solution slowly. The mixture is stirred slowly. In order to detect presence of more copper in the solution, a new steel knife is dipped into the solution. If a brownish coat appears on the knife, then more lime solution is added. The procedure is repeated until the brown coat stops getting formed on the knife. Presence of free copper is injurious to plants. Though Bordeaux mixture is useful for plants, it is found to be harmful for livestock on earth. Bordeaux mixture has been found to be harmful to fish and earthworms also, due to potential deposition of copper in soil and water.

I've mentioned "sneak-eating," whereby the culprit waits until the backs of others in the household are turned, then gobbles down every morsel in sight, and proceeds to cover his tracks by hiding wrappers and other evidence of the crime.
 I've explained how my son had stuffed dozens of Little Debbie snack cake wrappers behind my filing cabinet when he was in high school - a cellophane trove discovered only when I switched offices. And I added that my husband was "too defiant" to sneak-eat. Folks, I was wrong. It seems there's no level to which a man won't stoop when his wife has placed him on a diet he initially volunteered to follow, but without the merest fraction of sincerity.
 My rheumatologist knows I've been off and on the "food wagon" since I began seeing him in 2003. If during an appointment, I tip the scales a few pounds heavier than I did the last time, he will politely suggest that whatever I did to cause the gain, I should probably stop. Several years ago, I had a particularly bad spell. (I think I'm old enough now to employ the phrase "had a spell" - one I remember both my grandmothers using to denote various degrees and types of illness.)

"Si el rey no dice nada de los que le vitorean es porque sabe que son esos quienes le mantienen donde está. Está secuestrado"
 Si hubiera sido un pacto de legislatura solamente, tienes margen. Si el partido del Gobierno cumple, le apoyas; si no, no. Pero cuando estás en el Gobierno la responsabilidad es colegiada. No puedes decir que si algo sale mal es solo culpa de los otros. La prioridad es que trabajen en la sociedad. Si se queman, siendo los máximos líderes de la organización [se refiere a Podemos] chamuscan a toda la organización. Este lunes dijeron que necesitaban el apoyo de la gente y que esta siguiese siendo crítica y reivindicativa. Bien, pero para tener ese apoyo sabes que tienes que hacer lo que piden. Si no lo logras y a mitad de legislatura rompes el acuerdo de Gobierno, eso puede ser una catástrofe. Supongo que si entraron en el Gobierno fue porque miraron a Portugal, donde el Bloco de Esquerdas y el Partido Comunista apoyan al Partido Socialista pero desde fuera del Ejecutivo. Y es verdad que al final quien gobierna es quien capitaliza las victorias. Pero tú puedes seguir manteniendo tu credibilidad.

Denis Shapovalov would not play in the Australian Open if he felt conditions were unsafe amid continued concern over the air quality in Melbourne.
 Bushfires that have ravaged Australia in recent weeks led to a smoky haze drifting over Victoria, having a significant impact on qualifying for the first grand slam of 2020.
 Dalila Jakupovic had to retire from her qualifying match in distressing scenes after suffering a coughing fit during the second set against Stefanie Voegele.
 Tennis Australia has since published its air quality policy, which states play will be suspended if the concentration of P2.5 particles, which can impair lung function, exceeds 200 micrograms per cubic metre.
 The policy indicates there will be a discussion between medical staff and officials about whether it is advisable to play when the score is between 97 and 200.
 Speaking ahead of the tournament, where he will face Marton Fucsovics in the first round on Monday, Shapovalov was asked what he would do if he believed conditions to be unsafe.
 "I wouldn't play," he replied. "Obviously it's a grand slam, it's a big opportunity, but I'm 20 years old.
 "I don't want to risk my life, risk my health being out there in these conditions when I can play for the next 10, 15 years.
 "For my own health, if it gets bad, I just don't see what the point is. I think everyone's kind of on the same page. I don't think I've seen anyone happy with the way things are being dealt with."
 On the air quality policy, he added: "They send some email and say they have professionals looking at it and they use the term 'playable'.
 "For me it's just like, it's not great. You get warnings from the news telling people to stay inside, that it's not good to be outside, breathing this stuff in.
 "And then you get an email from the tournament saying it's playable and you guys have to go out there and put your life in jeopardy, put your health in jeopardy.
 "You see the effects on players it has right now, the last couple of days, but also you don't know what it's going to do later in our lives and how it could affect us if we're breathing this air in for two weeks."

Whew! We have hit the ground running in 2020. Literally.      Some break in the new year with a bang; others ease into their groove; either way, as long as you are moving.      The lower body is a target zone for many whether it is to tighten up and tone, build balance and endurance, or simply to increase strength. It's the whole lower half of our body so our options are plentiful.      Our move today is a close/wide stance, side to side squat. This move will be targeting inner and outer thighs, quads, and hamstring and build coordination also.      All you need is a good area to move around in. You can also add hand weights for extra resistance.      Begin this exercise by standing tall, holding your chest up, core engaged, and feet slightly wider than your hips.      Start by "sitting into" your squat. Go as low as you can efficiently hold this position, and step one leg out to a "wide stance" squat, quickly followed by bringing the other leg over to a close stance position, (again).      Now, return to your starting standing post, then immediately return to a squat. And this time, step out to the side with the opposite leg, into another wide stance, bringing the trail leg in close then stand again.      Continue this side to side move for at least 10 times in each direction.      Take a small break, then return for at least two more sets.      This move can be intensified by adding weight, and simplified by returning to a standing position after each squat motion.      And one of the best parts is this can double as cardio too!      Basically, this is a simple lower body move to add into your growing fitness plan for the new year.

MARSHALL, Mo. -- Just as they were a year ago, the Chillicothe High School basketball Hornets were confronted by a 1-man gang in their non-conference clash with the Marshall Owls.   Just as they did a year ago, they used a multiplicity of single-shot weaponry to subdue the semi-automatic firepower of MHS top gun Jace Lance.   Lance, who entered Thursday's game on his home court tied for Marshall's all- time career scoring lead, nearly matched his 39-points output of the December 2018 contest in Chillicothe by pumping 36 tallies this go-around. However, just as in the 76-58 CHS triumph in Chillicothe 13 months earlier, he couldn't do much more than keep the final spread respectable as CHS' Hornets won their fifth in a row, 70-53.   Chillicothe (10-3) erased its only deficit of the night with a 10-3 first- period surge that gave it a 12-6 advantage. After the opening frame ended with only a 15-13 Hornets advantage, the visitors posted 10 consecutive points and were in front by at least seven the rest of the contest.   After holding a closer-than-expected 32-25 lead at intermission, the Hornets repeated their early-second-stanza dominance with a 9-0 run to begin the second half and stayed up by double digits thereafter. The gap grew as great as 21 points in the middle of the fourth frame before the last three of Lance's six 3-pointers whittled the closing margin to 17.   "I thought we did a much-better job in the second half, offensively," Tim Cool, Chillicothe head coach, opined during his post-game broadcast interview. "… I thought we were confident in the first half, but just a little sloppy. I felt like we fixed that in the second half."   Statistically, beyond the Marshall scoring machine's production, Chillicothe received its customary 40-plus points from the duo of Westley Brandsgaard and C.J. Pfaff. The former hit right at his season average with 22 points and the latter - credited by team statisticians with 10 rebounds, four assists, three shot blocks, and two steals, as well - was right with him, netting 20.   They continued to score big with relatively-few shots, hitting a combined 15 of 23 shots from the floor (65 percent) and seven of 10 free throws.   Joining them in twin-figures scoring was junior guard Mason Baxter, who tallied 11, all after halftime.   In addition, junior guard Hayden Simmer's best game to date saw him approach a double-double, ringing up eight points - all in the opening stanza - and snaring seven rebounds officially. An unofficial count had had him with nine grabs.   "We had guys helping (on Lance) and we rebounded well, so, if they did miss, we got the rebound and it was our turn to play offense," Cool noted, concerning the rebounding effort which produced 32 CHS snares altogether.   According to CHS stats, the Hornets shot 60 percent from the field as a team, including a razor-sharp 8-of-13 showing from beyond the 3-points line. Simmer and We. Brandsgaard both sank two of three tries from "downtown."   Chillicothe also won Thursday's junior-varsity game, 55-22. Freshman Griff Bonderer popped in 17 points and classmate Wyatt Brandsgaard 15, each in only two quarters of action to keep them fully available as varsity reserves.   CHS' basketball boys will be at home for their next outing, welcoming Hamilton: Penney Tuesday.   While Hamilton hasn't had much success this season, the CHS coach said he believes his club will find a worthy foe on the floor with it.   "They had a good game against Trenton (Wednesday). They beat Trenton by 20 or so," he related. "They're a capable team. They've got some athletic kids."   Cool said he trusts his team's seniors to make sure they and their younger teammates are on task.   "Those guys aren't going to take games off. They're going to be ready to play," he predicted.   "That's a comforting thing for a coach, to know your leaders are going to be leading their teammates every game and expect them to show up and be ready."   Channeling his inner Carl Spackler (Caddyshack greenskeeper), the coach continued, "So, we've got that going for us, which is a good thing, and that's really helped this little run we're on right now is those guys are ready every game."

Las pizzas, las hamburguesas y las patatas fritas volverán a servirse en los comedores de los colegios de Estados Unidos por orden del presidente Donald Trump, acabando así con los estándares nutricionales que impulsó la exprimera dama Michelle Obama. El presidente estadounidense ha tomado esta decisión precisamente el día en el que Michelle Obama, que durante sus ocho años en la Casa Blanca tomó varias medidas para acabar con el problema de la obesidad infantil, cumple 56 años. Las nuevas reglas permitirán a las escuelas reducir la cantidad de verduras y frutas que se debe incluir en el menú escolar y les facilitará ofrecer más pizzas o hamburguesas. Los colegios también podrán disminuir la variedad de los alimentos frescos que se da a los estudiantes. La normativa fue dada a conocer por una agencia del Departamento de Agricultura de EEUU, que tiene como objetivo diseñar las comidas que alimentan a casi 30 millones de estudiantes en 99.000 escuelas. "Las escuelas y los distritos escolares continúan diciéndonos que todavía hay demasiados desperdicios de alimentos y que se necesita una mayor flexibilidad para proporcionar a los estudiantes comidas nutritivas y apetitosas. Les hemos escuchado y nos hemos puesto a trabajar", dijo el secretario de Agricultura, Sony Perdue, en un comunicado. La directora de la Asociación para una América más saludable, Nancy E. Roman, afirmó que la normativa es "un paso en la dirección equivocada" y consideró que, "la ciencia ha demostrado que debe incrementarse el consumo de frutas y vegetales" En Estados Unidos más de un tercio de los adultos y aproximadamente el 18 % de las personas entre 2 y 19 años son obesos, según los últimos datos de los Centros de Control y Prevención de Enfermedades

He was 27 years old.⁣ ⁣ Khagendra, who was born on 14 October 1992, stood at 67.08 cm (2 ft 2.41 in) tall when measured at Fewa City Hospital in Pohkara, Nepal, on the advent of his 18th birthday in 2010. ⁣ ⁣ Khagendra was born in the Baglung district of Nepal, the eldest son of Roop Bahadur and Dhan Maya. His father recalled, "He was so tiny when he was born that he could fit in the palm of your hand, and it was very hard to bathe him because he was so small."⁣ ⁣ According to friends, Khagendra had been struggling recently with heart problems, asthma and pneumonia.⁣ ⁣ "We're terribly sad to hear the news from Nepal that Khagendra is no longer with us," said Guinness World Records Editor-in-Chief Craig Glenday, who first met Khagendra during his visit to Italy in 2010. ⁣ ⁣ "His bright smile was so infectious that he melted the hearts of anyone who met him. As many people of short stature experience, life can be challenging when you weigh just 6 kg and you don't fit into world built for the average person. But Khagendra certainly didn't let his small size stop him from getting the most out of life. It's been an honour to know him and his family, and a privilege to share his story with the world."⁣ ⁣ Click the link in our bio for more memories of Khagendra.

QUINCY -- A new children's book about founding mother and local heroine Abigail Adams is sure to enlighten both kids and parents about her underrepresented impact on American history. The book emphasizes her indispensable contributions as first lady, in President John Adams's life and most impressively, how she managed to gain political power and influence despite being a woman in the 1700s.
 "I don't think there would be a founding father John Adams without the capability of Abigail Adams," said Barb Rosenstock, the book's author and award-winning writer of 17 children's books.      "Leave It to Abigail," which will go on sale Feb. 4, details the first lady's life from birth to death, with unique and fitting cross-stitch illustrations by Elizabeth Baddeley that weave together the different scenes of her life.
 Born on a farm in Weymouth, Abigail spent her days writing influential letters to John Adams, managing the family's finances, raising children and charming important leaders in the U.S. and Europe before retiring to a farm in Quincy.
 Rosenstock said she got the idea for the book a few years ago when a group of fourth-graders stopped to ask her a question after a book reading of one her of historical children's books. They asked her: "Why are all your books about boys?"
 "I thought 'I've kind of bought into this male history thing without even realizing it,'" she said.      So Rosenstock began searching for historic women to write about, and Abigail Adams came to mind. She said she now thinks she had given short shrift to Abigail and others whose role is "just as a wife and a mother," but after reading about Abigail was blown away by how fascinating she was.      In the book, Rosenstock highlights the many responsibilities Abigail took on on top of the typical duties of a woman of that time. She said Abigail wasn't just raising children and managing a household, she was collecting rent from tenants, importing goods, managing the family's finances and keeping up relationships with important people.
 "[John] Adams left their whole life in her hands and left to go run a revolution," she said. "...That's why I found Abigail so relatable in a way, because she was juggling everything."
 To learn more about Abigail, Rosenstock read biographies, as well as her well- preserved letters that reveal her humorous, bossy and intelligent writing that Rosenstock said she loves despite the terrible grammar and spelling.
 "She did not suffer fools," Rosenstock said. "Abigail was the kind of person you wanted to sit next to at a ball. Her asides must have been side- splitting."
 But Rosenstock said Abigail's life didn't become real to her until she traveled to Quincy and Weymouth to visit her birthplace and Peacefield, the home to four generations of the Adams family. She said Cathy Torrey of the Abigail Adams Historical Society and Caroline Keinath, a superintendent of the Adams National Historical Park, were instrumental in bringing Abigail to life for her by showing her Abigail's spaces and belongings.
 Rosenstock even came up with the book's title when Keinath was showing her Abigail's attic. Keinath explained that Abigail had hidden Revolutionary War colonist soldiers there, and Rosenstock said she felt amazed that Abigail was able to manage that alongside everything else she was already juggling.
 "And I just thought 'God, leave it to Abigail!'" she said.
 But perhaps what was most unique about Abigail was that she was able to use her skills within her contemporary social system to gain political power, respect from men and become her husband's most important confidante. Abigail was better with people and money than her husband, Rosenstock said, and made this clear by speaking her mind where other women stayed silent, which colonial American leaders noticed. She even earned the nickname "Mrs. President" during her time at the White House.
 But Rosenstock's favorite quality about Abigail was her unfaltering belief in her capabilities and intelligence despite the prevailing belief in female inferiority at the time. Rosenstock is clear that Abigail wasn't a feminist in the modern sense, but notes that she was one of the first people in the United States to express the opinion that women should be given more rights in her famous "Remember the ladies" letter to John Adams.
 Regardless, Abigail Adams's unstoppable spirit is something modern children can learn from, Rosenstock said.
 "She's a person who knows who she is, what she wants," she said. "People notice that even today."
