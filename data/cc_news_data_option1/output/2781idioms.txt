After a portion of the roof of the rickety Mahajanwadi building in Mattancherry collapsed on Wednesday, a section of the building will soon be demolished.
 While two families continue to live in one part of the building, the other section will be demolished, said T.K. Ashraf, councillor representing Mattancherry, by whose estimates, the building could have been built nearly a century ago. The property is managed by a trust under the Waqf Board.
 It is rows of such buildings with slanting roof that give Mattancherry an old- world charm.
 Around eight families living in the upper storey of the building had been rehabilitated to a three-storey building in Mattancherry by the Kochi Corporation last year, after complaints were raised of the building being in a dilapidated condition.
 The people in the vicinity, including nearly 30 families behind the Mahajanwadi building, are mostly landless and living in rundown houses, said Jaisin Kareem of Sunrise Kochi, an NGO based in Fort Kochi. But any sort of rehabilitation continues to evade them, he added.
 “It could be developed into a better residential complex and offered at a higher rent to tenants,” said B.M. Jamal, chief executive officer, Kerala State Waqf Board. However, that decision will remain with the trustee of the property, since the board plays a only supervisory role.

“They are the only indigenous species”, he said.
 He said there were concerns that the golf courses in Kerry could have caused issues for the endangered toads but the marine biologist believes the greens are helping to keep their numbers viable.
 “It has been beneficial to them because obviously there is no agricultural interference with their habitat”, he said.
 “Golf courses are good for them because nobody is going to go ploughing or digging or planting.
 “And when they are breeding in the early spring, golfers aren’t too active.
 “They are still under pressure because of ponds drying out with fine weather in the spring. That’s why we have to take them in and Fota Wildlife Park.”
 There is a theory that the toads could have originally come to Ireland on boats from Spain hundreds of years ago.
 “My figuring is they came from Spanish vessels many moons ago which would have been wrecked or came ashore to the Maharees or Dingle Bay because they are native to Spain and Portugal.
 “Maybe they have been here since the Ice Age but the strong possibility is that they are Lusitanian species who came ashore from Spain or Portugal.”
 He said the release of the teenage toadlets highlights the importance of the conservation work of Dingle Oceanworld which has been under severe financial strain due to the coronavirus.
 “The disadvantage this year was we didn’t have PHD students or Master's students who would usually be doing projects on the (toads). It was all done by ourselves.
