According to the information, a ten-person crew temporarily took care of 219 people on board the ship who had been taken in during rescue operations. 89 were saved on Thursday and 130 more on Friday. Because the ship was already full, 33 of them first had to stay on a life raft. There was also one dead on board, and other migrants were injured.

LONDONDERRY, N.H. -- Fresh off accepting the Republican Party's nomination, President Donald Trump said Friday he was the only thing standing between "democracy and the mob," as he lashed out at protesters who accosted his supporters as they left the White House the night before.


  Sowing fear about the implications of a Joe Biden victory to battleground state voters, Trump held a rally in New Hampshire on Friday evening. Looking to close his Democratic rival's lead with just over two months until Election Day, Trump was launching an aggressive travel schedule -- and continuing to flout coronavirus guidelines.


  Trump opened his rally with a rant against demonstrators who confronted those leaving his convention speech on the South Lawn. Some guests at the political event, including Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, needed to be escorted by police officers to safety upon leaving the White House grounds.


  "They walked out to a bunch of thugs," Trump said, criticizing District of Columbia Mayor Muriel Bowser for not doing more to protect his supporters. "Unhinged, manic rage. You ought to see last night in Washington, it was a disgrace."


  It marked his latest attempt to frame the general election as a dire choice between two futures for the nation -- a theme he was expected to amplify on the campaign trail.


  Trump said he directed White House chief of staff Mark Meadows to study how to call in the National Guard to the nation's capital. Trump previously ordered federal troops to the District in May amid protests over the killing of George Floyd in the custody of Minneapolis police.


  "We're not supposed to go in unless we call it an insurrection, and that's a big statement," Trump said. "But you know what we're going to do. ... We're going to have to look at it because we're not going to let that happen to people that go to the White House to celebrate our country."


  Trump said the protesters were "anarchists," adding: "They're just looking for trouble. Has nothing to do with George Floyd. Has nothing to do with anything. They don't even know who George Floyd is."


  "The agitators will go from rioting in the streets to running the halls of government," he added, saying voters needed to support him to "save democracy from the mob."


  "No one will be safe in Biden's America," he added.


  Speaking in New Hampshire, a state he lost in 2016 by fewer than 2,000 votes and is a top pickup opportunity for him in 2020, Trump repeated unfounded allegations that thousands of voters were bused into the state from neighboring Massachusetts four years ago.


  Trump also launched a new attack on Democratic vice presidential candidate Kamala Harris, speculating on the possibility that she could assume the presidency from the 78-year-old Biden. "You know I want to see the first woman president also, but I don't want to see a woman president get into that position the way she'd do it, and she's not competent," Trump said. "She's not competent."


  He suggested his own daughter, White House senior adviser Ivanka Trump, as a more suitable occupant for the Oval Office.


  While the coronavirus kills 1,000 Americans each day, Trump defied his own administration's pandemic guidelines on Thursday to speak for more than an hour to a tightly packed, largely mask-less crowd. In New Hampshire, a campaign advisory said masks for attendees are "required" in accordance with Republican Gov. Chris Sununu's executive orders, and would be provided.

But La Liga have given a boost to Barca’s hopes of keeping Messi by announcing that the release clause in his contract, set at $1.1 billion (AUD), still applies.Messi and his lawyers believe a separate clause means he should be allowed to leave for free this summer.Without passing a coronavirus test, Messi will be unable to join teammates for Ronald Koeman’s first training session on Monday, with the start of the new La Liga season less than two weeks away.Messi was due for testing at 10.15am on Sunday but according to sources at Barcelona, he failed to show up at the Ciutat Esportiva.The club’s captain and greatest ever player could now be punished with a fine and even a reduction in salary if the strike continues.Luis Suarez – his best friend and strike partner – and Arturo Vidal were among those seen arriving for tests, despite both players being told they should find new teams as part of a planned clear-out this summer.The meet-up was a chance for Messi to make his first public appearance since he stated his intention to leave Camp Nou last week.Instead, his absence offers a clear indication of his determination to secure a move and how ugly this dispute could now become. Taking part in the team’s pre-season program could damage his legal case if his departure ends up being settled in court.Barcelona insists a clause included in Messi’s contract that allowed him to go for free this summer had to be activated by June 10 and the only way the 33-year-old will be allowed to depart now is via the payment of $1.1 billion.La Liga, who were always likely to take the side of the club, agree that Messi’s release clause is still valid.“The contract is currently in force and has a ‘termination clause’ applicable if Lionel Andres Messi decides to activate the early unilateral termination of the contract,” La Liga said in a statement.“In compliance with the regulations and procedure in these cases, La Liga will not deregister the player from the (Spanish football) federation unless they have previously paid the amount of said clause.”Yet Messi’s lawyers believe the clause that allows him to leave for free refers not to a specific date but to 10 days after the end of the season.Given last season was extended into August due to the pandemic, with the Champions League final only played last weekend, they maintain Messi’s request to leave came within the agreed period.His absence on Sunday suggests he is prepared to do whatever it takes to quit the club he joined as 13-year-old boy, and where most expected him to continue all the way through to retirement.Supporters, some of whom stormed Camp Nou in protest last week, remain hopeful Messi might still be persuaded.Outside the training ground on Sunday morning, a young boy wearing a Messi shirt sat with his head in his hands, hoping his hero could yet return. Mundo Deportivo, the Barcelona daily with close links to the board, wrote on Saturday how the club is defiant, even if every stance now could be a negotiating ploy.“The more the days go by, the firmer the board and president Josep Maria Bartomeu are in not moving from their position,” it read. “Which is not to sell and, if possible, to renew the contract of Messi.”Bartomeu made it known through the Spanish press on Thursday that he would resign if Messi said publicly that he was the problem and agreed to change his mind.But Messi has remained steadfast. His snub on Sunday comes after he asked for a meeting, not to negotiate, but to begin facilitating an amicable and dignified departure.Manchester City remain favourites to sign the 33-year-old, whose basic salary alone amounts to around $100 million.If Barcelona and Messi decide to avoid a lengthy legal process, a compromise selling price of around $160 million could be within reach for City, while eliminating their less wealthy rivals.Messi has reportedly spoken to City coach Pep Guardiola already but others remain in the running, including Paris Saint-Germain, Inter Milan and Juventus. Fans erupt after Lionel Messi's bombshell decision to depart the club is announced. — AFP

I apologise in advance, Stu, if this answer-turned-column is a bit short, because you’ve already done a lot of the troubleshooting I would have suggested. And that’s awesome! You’re already six steps ahead of the game. Even though you weren’t able to come up with a working solution, the fact that you can cross out a number of ideas on your “won’t something fix this, please” list is a step in the right direction, and it helps us narrow down to a few other tricks to try.
 Given that _nothing_ has solved your issue, and you’ve tried all of the usual steps I would have recommended, my first and initial thought is to factory reset your phone. I realise that’s leading with the nuke, rather than the surgical strike, but I wonder if simply starting from scratch on your Android might cure whatever setting is now making it impossible for Windows 10 to see your phone.

But I’m not sure they feel like real young people of the 2020s in the same way that Bill and Ted felt like relatively authentic, only slightly caricatured 1980s teens. I mean, I’m sure _Face the Music_ isn’t aimed at today’s youngsters but at nostalgic Xers like myself, who I’m sure would like to think their kids idolize them so much that they are like little spiritual clones of their parents. (I have no kids, so I have no stake in such a dynamic.) But how much more intriguing could Bill and Ted’s return have been if they’d had to contend with genuine-feeling Millennials rather than these pale Xer xeroxes?

While he was in the country, he tried to find products and information about China but was unsuccessful, which led him to create a website related to his country with a friend. In less than two hours, he received several emails from Chinese investors interested in his project.

Saturday’s win over Liverpool didn’t quite come in 90 minutes, still, Jurgen Klopp’s team, lined-up with all the heavy-hitters in the squad except Trent Alexander-Arnold, were favoured to wipe the floor with Mikel Arteta’s side.
 As it turned out, Arsenal weren’t disgraced. In truth, they limited the Premier League champions to a handful of clear-cut opportunities.
 In the first-half at the Home of Football, the world champions were underwhelming and were laboured in possession, despite having a lion’s share of it before the interval. Instead, the Reds failed to test the confident Emiliano Martinez in the opening 45, with the Gunners retaining the greater threat in transition.

If you have a self-cleaning oven, most of the work is already done for you. The self-cleaning cycle will lock your oven door and heat it up to the highest possible temperature for several hours, burning everything inside. Let it cool afterward, and wipe all the burnt bits with a damp cloth.
 If you don’t have a self-cleaning oven, you can get the same effect by placing a cup or bowl of ammonia in the oven, closing the door, and letting it sit for 4-5 hours. The ammonia fumes will release a lot of the gunk cooked onto the oven walls and ceiling. Then use rubber gloves to dilute the ammonia in water and use the resulting solution to wipe down the oven’s interior.

LAKE BUENA VISA, Fla. — On the heels of an historic and emotional week that had the Toronto Raptors "very close" to leaving the NBA bubble, being back on the court offered no refuge for the defending NBA champions on Sunday.
 Jayson Tatum and Marcus Smart scored 21 points apiece to lead the Boston Celtics to a lopsided 112-94 win over the Raptors in Game 1 of their best-of- seven Eastern Conference semifinals.
 And in the minutes after the demoralizing loss, the Raptors spoke about the emotional toll of recent events, including protests and the subsequent league shutdown after last week's shooting of Jacob Blake, a Black man, in Wisconsin.
 "Basketball always matters, but in this situation, at this time, it's taking a backseat," Lowry said. "Yes, it's our job and we're going to go out there and perform at the highest level we can possibly perform at. There's no excuses, but we have an obligation right now to use our platform. That's why we're still here."
 Lowry, who'd been a question mark after suffering a sprained left ankle in Game 4 a week ago against Brooklyn, had 17 points, eight assists and six rebounds. Serge Ibaka had 15 points and nine boards off the bench, Pascal Siakam had 13 points, OG Anunoby had 12, Fred VanVleet added 11 points, and Norm Powell finished with 10.
 Sport can be solace in turbulent times, but coach Nick Nurse said that wasn't the case for his team Sunday.
 "There was no joy," Nurse said. "It was a tough day for us. . . nothing was much fun out there today."
 A sluggish start was almost expected considering the week. But the Raptors, who've rolled to 32 wins in their past 37 games, were slow and disorganized on the defensive end, and struggled mightily on offence. They were outscored 51-30 from three-point range.
 Boston improved to 4-1 against Toronto this season, including two lopsided victories in the restart bubble.
 The Raptors didn't put up much of a fight, trailing 19 points in the first half. The gap grew to 22 points in the third quarter, and when Tatum hit a baseline jumper to end the third, Boston headed into the fourth up 88-73.
 A three-point play by Lowry to start the fourth sliced the difference to 12, but that was as close as the Raptors would come, and when Smart scored on a three in front of Boston's bench, the long bomb had the Celtics up by 24 points with just under five minutes to play.
 Celtics coach Brad Stevens dismissed suggestions Boston controls the series heading into Tuesday's Game 2.
 "We're not even in the ballpark of doing that yet," Stevens said. "We won one game."
 The game marked a second restart of sorts. Racial and social injustice was already a theme for the NBA's restart after several high-profile deaths in the U.S. ignited protests. After Blake's shooting, Powell and VanVleet raise the possibility of a boycott.
 On Wednesday, the Milwaukee Bucks did just that, refusing to take the court for their game against Orlando. That led to a shutdown of the league for three days and similar strikes among several pro sports leagues, including the WNBA and NHL.
 Asked if the Raptors considered leaving, Ibaka said "We were close, we were very close. We're here . . . we are here for a reason, not only to play basketball but to use our platform to change things out there."
 Early in the game, Boston's big man Daniel Theis blew by Marc Gasol like the Spaniard's feet were glued to the floor. The moment exemplified a Raptors defence that was a step behind from the opening whistle. Boston led 39-23 to end the first quarter.
 Ibaka's layup capped a 7-0 run to start the second and had the Raptors within nine points. But Toronto's woeful shooting continued — the Raptors were just 1-for-12 from long distance in the second quarter and 5-for-23 from the field. Boston built its lead back up to 17 and took a 56-42 advantage into the halftime break.
 Late in the third, a VanVleet turnover led to a windmill dunk by Boston's Robert Williams. The demoralizing play summed up Toronto's afternoon.
 Lowry said the roller-coaster week, however, wasn't to blame.
 "Emotionally, it hit us hard," he said. "(But) today we just didn't play well. We didn't play well enough to win the basketball game and no excuses made, we've got to play hard, we've got to go out there and do our jobs harder, do our coverages harder, execute better.
 "The Boston Celtics beat us tonight, one game, we have to regroup, readjust, and get ready for the next one."
 After dispatching the Brooklyn Nets easily in four games in the opening round, the Raptors indeed face a much stiffer test against Boston, which seems to have found the formula against Toronto. The Raptors beat 10 teams in the NBA's restart including Milwaukee and Los Angeles, but have now lost twice by a combined 40 points to Boston.
 The Raptors need Siakam, who picked up three early fouls, to get going offensively.
 "(Early foul trouble) kind of makes you think about how you play and stuff and it makes you question a lot of things in how you move, but it happened and I've just got to figure out a way to bounce back once that happens," he said. "I can't let it affect my game."
 The afternoon began with a moment of silence for 18-year NBA veteran Cliff Robinson, coach Lute Olson, and actor Chadwick Boseman, who all died this week.
 "It was very sad to see him leave us so early," Ibaka said of Boseman.
 Both teams knelt with arms linked for the U.S. and Canadian anthems.

Following its June exploit (1st position with 317 registrations), the Model 3 is out of the Top 10 for the first time this year, in what is most likely due to a temporary combination of low inventory, coupled with the wait for new incentives.

By simply making a minor adjustment to "how the walls moved," along with the softness, intensity, and color of the light on the iPad, Hardy was able to replicate the sense that the two were seated by a fire watching television. By this point in the series we start to see what was happening inside Devs as cold and sterile, but using this concept of an ever-evolving lighting and spatial interior, Hardy could organically motivate and create this intimate fireplace-lit moment on the fly.

Poi, secondo quanto ricostruito dai militari di Viterbo, &ldquo;con una manovra repentina ha ingranato la marcia proprio verso il carabiniere davanti al mezzo, investito e scaraventato a terra&rdquo; . Successivamente il 37enne ha provato a farsi largo speronando diverse volte una delle due auto di servizio dei carabinieri che nel frattempo avevano bloccato il passaggio lungo la via.

MADISON, Ill. — Josef Newgarden raced to his second IndyCar victory of the season Sunday, holding off rookie Pato O'Ward before a late caution ended the race at World Wide Technology Raceway under the yellow flag.
 It's the second IndyCar race to finish under caution in one week. Takuma Sato won the Indianapolis 500 under yellow last Sunday.
 In the second of two weekend races at the short oval outside of St. Louis, it was Sato who brought out the caution with four laps remaining when he hit the wall. The pace car picked up the field with three laps remaining and IndyCar did not have enough time to restart the race.
 It denied O'Ward a chance to challenge the reigning IndyCar Series champion for the victory. Newgarden, in a Chevrolet for Team Penske, won for the 16th time in his career and closed the points deficit on championship leader Scott Dixon.
 Dixon won Saturday in the first race of the Gateway doubleheader and has four victories in nine IndyCar races this season. Newgarden and Team Penske have three wins.
 Newgarden was put in position to win the race when his crew got him off pit lane on the final stop ahead of O'Ward. Newgarden and the Mexican driver had a drag race back onto the track that Newgarden won.
 “This was a pit stop victory for me,” Newgarden said. “Really proud of my team. I didn’t win the race, they won it.”
 O'Ward, the top rookie in the Indy 500 with a sixth-place finish, earned his second podium of the weekend for Arrow McLaren SP. He was third on Saturday and has six finishes this season of eighth or higher.
 “We’re knocking on the door,” O'Ward said. “We are very close and we are going to keep pushing. I know our time will come.”
 Newgarden praised the progress O'Ward is making in his first full IndyCar season.
 “He did an amazing job. He’s going to do great things in the sport,” Newgarden said.
 Although O'Ward seemed to be waiting for the final laps to make a move on Newgarden, he said he didn't think he had a shot at catching him even if the race had one final restart.
 "I was pushing, pushing, pushing to get close to him to try to strike, and I just couldn’t do it,” O'Ward said.
 Will Power had a shot at winning the race until his final pit stop, when he was slowed behind Ed Carpenter as both cars drove down pit lane. Power finished third to put two Team Penske's on the podium but was aggravated with his result.
 “We had a very good car, I thought we had the car to win but obviously it’s a traffic game,” Power said. “We certainly have had a lot of potential this year, it's a very strange year.”
 Rinus VeeKay finished fourth and was met after the race by Colton Herta, who finished sixth but was angry at how the rookie had raced him late. Herta and VeeKay exchanged words.
 “I really don’t have too much fun driving against him," Herta said, noting the 19 year old “still has a lot too learn.”
 Dixon was fifth and still holds a commanding 96-point lead in the standings with three races remaining on the official schedule. A postponed doubleheader at Mid-Ohio is expected to be rescheduled to give IndyCar five races to close the year.
 “We can’t give up on it yet,” said Newgarden, a two-time champion. "We’ve been pretty bitten by bad luck this year. What are you going to do? Sometimes it comes your way, sometimes it does not.
 Tony Kanaan finished 19th in his final race of the season. Kanaan ran only the oval events this year while easing into retirement. He's hopeful to run at least the Indianapolis 500 next season but so far has only committed to a new all-star series run by Tony Stewart for 2021.
 The race started about 20 minutes late because of oil spilled on the track by a service vehicle after the NASCAR Trucks Series race earlier in the day.

I thought I’d better do a rewatch of _Bill & Ted’s Excellent Adventure_ and _Bill & Ted’s Bogus Journey_ before we got _Bill & Ted Face the Music_. I hadn’t seen either of the earlier films in ages, maybe not since they were new, and I remember really enjoying them, what with me being a GenX child of the 80s and all. But I approached them again now with some trepidation. Would I would still see them as most excellent, or would I now find them totally heinous?

My concern now is how we communicate with each other. Back in the old days, if a salesperson needed to contact a prospective buyer, they might send a letter. After the letter arrived, the salesperson would call the prospect and maybe a set up a face to face meeting. The meeting would take place and hopefully the sale was completed. Today that entire process has been changed by technology. There are so many ways to contact someone that do not involve a telephone. Need to contact your boss, email them. Maybe you need to reach out to a friend, you can text a message to them. If you are on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter (or the many other choices in social media), you can send a message. During the current pandemic, the use of video conferencing has become a popular way to hold a meeting. This got me thinking, does anyone just pick up the phone and call people anymore?

Jim and Ruth – Loma, CO
 Jim and Ruth,
 Again, many issues to uncover and consider here. First, you are thinking resale and I always love it when people think resale! What you do to your home while you live there will significantly impact the value of your home either positively or negatively. By focusing on resale, it does not guarantee anything, however it will help ensure your actions have a positive impact on your bottom line when you do decide to sell.
 A retaining wall can be a definite value-add to a property from both the function side and the aesthetic looks of our landscaping. The most important thing, in my mind, is to have it done by a professional, so it looks like it was done by a professional. Case in point, I added a pond to my property five years ago and around three quarters of the pond we had a boulder retaining wall that went from ground level at a 90 degree angle up the side of the pond to the top edge. It looked awful! I had a visitor ask me one time, “Why did you build an elephant watering hole?” Yikes! Needless to say, we did not feel very good about our “pond.”

The Federal Reserve is on a lower for longer trajectory which has sunk the greenback, lifting the bird. The RBNZ is expected to decide upon a negative interest rate regime, but the bird is firm across the board. NZD/USD is currently trading at 0.6733 and between a low of 0.6727 and a high of 0.6741 in a relatively choppy start to the end of the month. Ahead o the weekend, the USD bears were fading rallies in the mid-lower end of the 92 handle in the DXY following the Jackson Hole aftermathwhich helped elevatethe bird to fresh COVID-19 era highs. Consideringthat high nominal and realdollarrates were the key ingredients behind USD strength in prior years, the fact that the Federal Reserve is sent the prospects of interest rate hikes way over the horizon does not bode well for the greenback. However, the birdhas also made decent gains on most crosses and this is all despite the probable outcome that the Reserve bank of New Zealand will cut rates to negative. NZ can ill-afford a higher exchange rate, but as we noted Friday, the Fed's new policy target does neutralise the RBNZ's threat of negative rates somewhat, and we might have to live with one for a bit longer, analysts at ANZ Bank argued who noted that theprice action is bullish and the suggestthe next target as the January 1sthigh of 0.6756. Meanwhile, on the coronavirus updates,Auckland has officially moved to Level 2 but still has more restrictions in place than the rest of the country hence why it is referred to as Level 2.5.

Todhunter presented the HealthTechS3 report. "I have a few things to report. I think we're very fortunate to have someone with Priscilla's expertise (Priscilla Lucero, Southwest New Mexico Council of Governments executive director, who presented earlier in the meeting) on board. I expect she will help us quite a bit. As you talked about the (ICIP – infrastructure capital improvement plan) list and the order, Kelly and Scott have already been looking into the labor and delivery plan. We have a concern about the number and the age of the plan. We will dig into it and try to come up with a better number for the governing board. I have some concern about the staging issue. I don't want to get some funding and not have something functional. We will bear down on that. I wanted to follow up on the swing beds. That will be meaningful for this hospital. It will help people who need care, but not hospital care to stay in our environment. It will allow the patient to stay here, the family to stay in the community. It will also allow patients who may have received care elsewhere to come back to Gila Regional, and we can meet their needs here. On the financial side of that, for the average case for our hospital we will normally see revenue of $25,000-$27,000 per swing bed. So, you can see the impact it will have on our hospital. It should be a very positive thing for our patients going forward. We have a first cut on our productivity numbers. We are having some challenges getting the right numbers and statistics, so we're working on that. Hopefully, by next month we'll have a better feel about how accurate the numbers are."

That pairing between Harden and Dort was what changed first, in the complete of the first two quarters. The defense of the young man on the already MVP of the NBA was ineffective and Harden began to leave many points in the bag of his team. As many as 20. There the Rockets were holding out thanks to him because Russell Westbrook, the great novelty of this appointment, had scored four points in the first minutes and his contribution would be little more than that by having neither pace nor confidence after the games that had to watch from the sidewalk. Gordon was helping something, but it was Harden who was holding. And Dort, their defender, neither saw a way to stop him nor saw a hoop when they were left in attack: he finished with a disgraceful 0/9 on 3-pointers for 3/16 on total field goals.

Hundreds of parents and students gathered outside the Massachusetts State House in Boston on Sunday to protest Gov. Charlie Baker’s mandate requiring children — even those attending classes remotely — to receive the flu vaccine if they want to return to school.
 “I should be starting school, not fighting for my right to be in school,” Emerson Kearns of Wareham, who is entering her freshman year, told the crowd.
 Earlier this month, state health officials announced all students 6 months and older will be required to get the flu vaccine by the end of the year, unless medically or religiously exempt. Baker said the mandate came about as a means to take pressure off health-care systems as the coronavirus pandemic extends into flu season, but the requirement will stay in place even after the pandemic ends.
 Sutton mom Candice Edwards, one of the protest organizers and a well-known voice organizing against vaccine mandates in Massachusetts, said it is a decision that has angered parents.
 Sutton said parents were “blindsided” by the flu vaccine mandate amid a pandemic that has already placed undue stress on families.
 Edwards said dozens of parents have reached out to her for advice on receiving religious exemptions.
 “I told them, ‘We’re not taking the easy way out. We have to stand up and fight,’” Edwards said after the protest.
 Still, Edwards and other protesters at Sunday’s rally say they’re “not antivaccine.”
 “I would never tell someone not to vaccinate,” Edwards said, noting she supports reform.
 Holding a sign that read “Parents call the shots,” Jessica Marchant of Westminster said she attended Sunday’s protest with her husband and three school-aged children to “support parents’ right to choose.” Marchant vaccinated her two oldest children but said she’s started to rethink vaccine safety after she said her 1-year-old daughter suffered respiratory side effects and severe eczema after getting vaccines.
 “Parents should be informed on the benefits and risks and then they should make the decisions,” Marchant said. “Having a mandate takes away informed consent and it becomes coercion.”
 “I’m not antivaccine. I’m anti the government telling me what I can or what my child can do with our bodies,” said Joshua Dunsky of Dunstable, as his 8-year- old daughter Josie sat at his feet.
 Dunskey said just the oldest of his five children is vaccinated.
 Bonnie Marcil of Gardner carried a sign painted with the handprints of her three children in middle and high school that read, “We do not consent.”
 “When the government starts saying we don’t have a choice anymore, that’s what scares me. This is the first step. We will never take the coronavirus vaccine and I know that’s the next stage,” Marcil said.
 Tiffany Comeau of Templeton said she is protesting for choice.
 “I support parents who want to (vaccinate), but I feel like it should be a choice,” she said.
 Vincent Delaney, a Peabody man who is suing Baker in federal court over the coronavirus pandemic business shutdowns, organized Sunday’s protest after what he called the latest “example of government overreach” perpetrated by the Baker administration.
 “It’s not his job to decide. It should be between a parent and a doctor to make that decision,” Delaney said, noting he got his first-ever flu shot last year.
 “I’m a constitutional guy and I will fight government overreach every step of the way. This is about personal choice,” Delaney said.

Although comfortable herself, she could see the fear in the eyes of the residents who had received positive test results.
 “We spent a lot of time calming fears,” Bouse said. “It’s hard enough to be in assisted living. All the early news coming in on the television said having the virus was a death sentence. It’s just not true.”
 In addition to calming patients’ fears, the nurses also worked with families, who were cut off from their loved ones when they needed them most. “Watching families just want to reach out and couldn’t. That really hurt,” Bouse said. “Seeing residents who were sick and going through it without their families was hard. They couldn’t even comfort each other.”
 Bouse, who lives in Steelville, followed a strict routine when her workday was over in an effort to not bring the virus home to her three children, ages 20, 18 and 6.
 “Every day on my way home, when I’d get to Cuba, I’d call home and make sure my son was occupied so he wouldn’t run right up to me,” Bouse said. “I would pull into the garage, go straight into the laundry room and put my clothes directly into the washer.”
 Just like the residents she cared for all day, Bouse had to quarantine from family members. “I was raised by my grandparents,” Bouse said. “I didn’t get to see them from the end of March into July.”
 Despite the fears and tears, there have been some bright spots during pandemic. “I have a lot more respect for frontline caregivers and a lot more compassion for our residents and their families,” Bouse said.
 In the early days of the virus in Franklin County, long-term care facilities were especially hard hit with positive cases and the majority of deaths in the county were residents of those facilities.
 “I don’t know that anything more could have been done,” Bouse said. “Our management stayed on top of CDC guidelines, and we followed policies and procedures that kept everyone safe. I’m blessed that this is where I work.”
 Bouse currently oversees Americare facilities in Sullivan, Cuba, Owensville, Vienna and Rolla.

The words expressed most often to Mary Lou’s family was that, “she was the kindest, sweetest, most thoughtful woman I’ve ever known.” She was patient, even in the face of the most challenging situations. She was full of goodness and self-control. She always tried to put herself in the shoes of another, which made her relatable, easy to talk to, and a safe confidant. She was nurturing and wholly devoted to her family. She was known to spend hours listening, caring, consoling, and guiding. She was a firm believer in forgiving and letting go, and modeled that for her family. She believed that grudges would rob her and her loved ones of peace and joy, and she wanted more than that for her family. Her faith could move mountains.
