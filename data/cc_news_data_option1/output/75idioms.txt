The buy-now-pay-later service, based in Melbourne, Australia, has pledged AU$200,000 ($137,000) to the Australian Red Cross Disaster Relief and Recovery Fund on behalf of its employees and has set up a donation page for customers. It has also contacted its 42,500 retail partners to encourage them to promote donations, which support emergency response efforts, volunteer training and more, and said Steve Madden and others have been eager to help. “We know that when a disaster happens, especially on our doorstep, Australians have an incredible ability to band together to help one another," said Afterpay CEO Anthony Eisen in a statement. “Our thoughts go out to all the families and individuals that have lost their homes or local businesses, as well as all the firefighters and volunteers working around the clock.”

Worse. They're making moves to try and save the season. They added Marco Scandella to the blue line and signed Ilya Kovalchuk to help their depleted forward group. Kovy was immediately put into a top line role and ee looked pretty solid in his first game with the Habs on Monday, recording an assist. But it's probably fair to assume that these moves aren't significant enough to right the ship. The Habs are in the midst of another big slide, losing six in a row and falling further out of contention.

As expected. The Kings have had some bright spots this season but they're still very much a mess. They've lost six of their last eight and things should continue to be tough for them, especially as they sell off some pieces closer to the deadline. At the end of the day, this is where they were always supposed to be.

Most bands of Van Halen's stature have re-released their older albums with bonus tracks. Their failure to do that has left not just a ton of money on the table, but it's likely impelled fans to get their hands on the material through illicit means and share it publicly. The stuff is simply too interesting to too many people to collect dust in a vault. And the Universal fire is a frightening example of what can happen to tape archives that aren't backed up anywhere.
