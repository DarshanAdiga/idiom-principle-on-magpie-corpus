At least 88 indigenous people have already died of COVID-19 in the Amazon, according to a tally by the Brazilian indigenous organization APIB that includes health ministry figures and information from local leaders. The count is likely higher, because hospitals often don't use patients' indigenous names when admitting them.

In light of these disruptions, my Graduate Division team and I hosted a virtual Graduate Student Town Hall on May 5 to answer your questions and concerns. In addition to posting a recording of the event, I wanted to address three of the most frequently asked questions posed during the town hall.

Of course there is nothing wrong with defining the business you are in this way because that is what you actually do anyway. But a narrow definition of your business coupled with a focus on what you currently offer limits your potential for growth as an organisation because as American scholar Noam Chomsky put it, the structure of language determines not only the thought but reality itself.
 Let me shine the spotlight on the media industry (oh, there we go, again!) in Kenya (and by extension the East Africa region) where I have worked for a considerable period of time. If you assess the enterprises, you will note that they mainly operate from the same rulebook: a media house will ideally have a newspaper or two, a few radio and TV stations as well as the some versions of the same products online (wrongly called digital assets). It is true that some have tried to shore up their fortunes by investing in certain areas like sports betting but such efforts have been feeble at best and disjointed at worst. So the firms have largely defined themselves around three product offerings- radio, TV broadcasting and newspaper. And the business model has majorly been reliant on adverting revenue.
 Yet because of digital technology, other non-media enterprises (in the traditional sense) like Facebook, Google, Instagram and YouTube are taking a huge portion of this ad revenue. When you define your business narrowly, you are like a farmer who expects the tree he has planted to grow forever and probably touch the sky!
 Let‚Äôs now pick the example of the so-called Telco industry and specifically zero in on a company like Safaricom in Kenya. Among the services that Safaricom offers to customers today include mobile telephony, mobile money transfer (MPesa), consumer electronics, ecommerce, cloud computing, data, music streaming, and fibre optic services. More offerings are definitely in the pipeline. Notice that unlike the enterprises in media - okay, Safaricom is also media company- Safaricom has leveraged its core capabilities to extend and expand its offering to customers. These services do not fit the narrow definition of the offering of a telecommunications firm. The one thing they do is that they increase switching costs for customers. While announcing the Safaricom results for the financial year ended March 2020, immediate former CEO Michael Joseph said, ‚Äúwe have stayed the course, given consumers more value and put the customer first by delivering relevant products and services.‚Äù Safaricom announced a profit of Sh 74 billion, a record profit for a local company. It is all about the customer and what they need to transact life events; that is what a next generation enterprise does.
 MIT digital research leaders Peter Weill and Stephanie Woerner have described a next generation enterprise as a ‚Äúdestination for customers navigating life events rather than a place they go to make a transaction‚Äù.
 One more example. Which business would you say Amazon is in? Lets try; you would say Amazon is a store for books and electronics in which case its competitors would be the likes of Best Buy, Walmart or Barnes & Noble. Amazon is also in the ad network business directly competing with Google. When it comes to being an App store, Amazon is competing with Google and Apple. Amazon‚Äôs video on demand (VOD) service directly competes with Hulu and Netflix, among others while Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a direct competitor to IBM and Microsoft.
 Amazon Studio is in direct competition with any studio that produces video content! This list isn‚Äôt exhaustive, but it gives you the picture of a next generation enterprise. It is impossible to define Amazon in the traditional sense because it has always expanded its scope around customers and not industry or competitors.
 Business Imperatives in the digital age
 Prof Sunil Gupta, the Cochair of the Executive Program on Driving Digital Strategy at Harvard Business School advises business executives to bear in mind three things about business competitive advantage in the digital age.
 First, competition is not anymore defined by traditional boundaries. Uber might not have been so successful had taxi companies kept in touch with consumer needs and provided a convenient way to order and pay for a cab, he says.
 Secondly, competitive advantage no longer comes from low cost and product differentiation as management guru Michael Porter once advised. Your sustainable competitive advantage shall ensue from a deep knowledge of customers, and this can be attained by leveraging digital technologies to mine customer data. The organization must continually invest in and upgrade its capabilities, including people, to be prepared to serve customers in new ways.
 Thirdly, if a firm can be able to provide a system of complementary products and also create a platform with strong network effects it will have a strong competitive advantage.
 That is what the likes of Safaricom and Amazon are doing- they continue to exploit the core while at the same time exploring the ‚Äúwhite spaces‚Äù as business model innovation expert Mark Johnson, a cofounder of Strategy and Innovation Consultancy firm Innosight, would put it.
 So once again, what business are you really in?

In the same way that garlic and a cross were supposed to ward off vampires in times past, the face mask is supposed to fend off the "invisible enemy" lurking everywhere at once.

Questa posizione, come specificato dal Presidente Macron, e evidentemente il frutto del lavoro congiunto con altri partners europei, in primis l‚ÄôItalia, in vista della proposta della Commissione Europea sul Recovery Fund e piu in generale sugli altri temi evocati come: salute, investimenti, ricerca, politica industriale e concorrenza, che rappresentano obiettivi prioritari dell‚Äôagenda europea". Cosi fonti di Palazzo Chigi, dopo la proposta formalizzata da Germania e Francia. "La proposta franco-tedesca di Recovery Fund, infatti - proseguono le stesse fonti - recepisce importanti elementi portati avanti da Francia, Italia ed altri Paesi quanto a trasferimenti e meccanismo di anticipo delle risorse, il cosiddetto frontloading. Una dimensione di 500 miliardi euro di soli trasferimenti e senz‚Äôaltro un buon punto di partenza, ed e comunque una dotazione di sussidi che si avvicina a quanto richiesto di recente dall‚ÄôItalia e dagli altri partners. Da questa somma si puo partire per rendere ancora piu consistente il Recovery Fund, nel quadro del budget europeo".

Gang Green's offensive line struggles can be attributed largely to a lack of cohesion among the unit.

As a result, more than one million borrowers have been blacklisted by the CRBs for defaulting on less than Sh1,000, something that can easily be linked to the ‚Äúeasy‚Äù and aggressively marketed mobile phone loans.
 Although the rules, if passed will offer relief to borrowers, we must however take an early opportunity to urge caution so that we do not throw out the baby with the bathwater. Despite their shortcomings, CRBs have heralded a new wave of financial literacy as borrowers work hard not to be blacklisted. Weakening the role of CRBs is, therefore, likely to lead to a moral hazard and a borrowing culture in which anything goes if there are no consequences for defaulting.
 That said, the bottom line remains that borrowers currently wallowing in the corona lockdowns should not be denied loans just because of CRB negative listing as has been happening.

Womble spent his last years in the General Assembly seeking financial payments and other assistance for victims of the state-sponsored eugenics program that ended in the 1970s.
 North Carolina sterilized about 7,600 people whom the state deemed feeble- minded or otherwise undesirable between 1929 and 1974. While most of the people were either forced or coerced into having the procedure, a small number of them chose to be sterilized.
 It wasn‚Äôt until 2013 that lawmakers agreed to set aside $10 million for payments to victims ‚Äî making North Carolina the first state to pay compensation to the victims of a government-run sterilization program.
 Womble‚Äôs chief ally for the cause was a Republican ‚Äî then-House Speaker Thom Tillis, now a U.S. senator.
 ‚ÄúLarry was relentless in shining a light on one of the darkest moments of our state‚Äôs history, and he never backed down and never gave up in the pursuit of justice,‚Äù Tillis said in a news release, calling supporting Womble‚Äôs efforts ‚Äúone of the greatest honors of my life.‚Äù
 In 2012, a still-recovering Womble returned to the legislative complex in a wheelchair to push for financial compensation. Lawmakers left town that year with no agreement on funding.
 ‚ÄúI hope all of you support this history-making event that no one else in this nation has ever done,‚Äù Womble told colleagues at the time. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll be on the right side of history.‚Äù
 Womble was a strong advocate on issues of race, pressing for passage of the 2009 Racial Justice Act, which gave death row prisoners a way to seek a reduced sentence because of racial bias. The law was ultimately repealed by the Republican-controlled legislature. He was known for his colorful suits and soliloquies on Black history on the House floor.
 ‚ÄúHe never backed down from a fight and was always honest about his beliefs, even when they weren‚Äôt always popular,‚Äù said state Democratic Party Chairman Wayne Goodwin, who served with Womble in the House. ‚ÄúHe made a point of giving a voice to the voiceless and, in his own words, to ‚Äòmake government personal.‚Äô‚Äù
 A Winston-Salem native, Womble became a teacher and school administrator. He was elected to the alderman board in 1981 and for years served as the board‚Äôs only Black alderman from a majority-white ward, according to the Winston-Salem Journal.
 A jury acquitted Womble in 1992 after he and two other men were indicted on federal charges of conspiring to extort donations from businessmen in exchange for favorable votes, the Journal reported.
 Womble‚Äôs funeral arrangements were incomplete on Friday, Bonham said.

Yes, so the way -- and Stewart since you are there in the UK, you're probably as close to it as anybody, but I'll tell you, the way the UK at least as it stands right now is, they are talking about coming back in phases and it looks to us as though the lion's share of our business will be categorized in phase three of the retail relaunch, which would include everything from our motorway services to pubs to holiday parks and licensed betting shop offices. Although there's a lot of political stuff going on behind the scenes, it looks to us like the first week of July is when we expect the UK retail. We could see some positive movement earlier because I know there's certainly -- the industries are lobbying, 50 opened earlier as non-essential retail. But I think from a planning standpoint, we're assuming the first week of July. I don't know, Stewart, if you want to add anything more?

Businesses, especially those that supply medical equipment related to the war on Coronavirus have been booming since the first case of the disease was reported in Kenya mid March.
 In the initial days, face mask and sanitiser manufacturers cashed in on the surge in demand for these products, which are key to keeping the virus at bay.
 Profiteers and counterfeiters have since seen an opportunity to make a kill with substandard goods, exposing the public to the risk of not only contracting the viral disease but to other public health and safety risks associated with poor quality products.
 That is why the move by the Kenya Bureau of Standards (Kebs), which has issued the specifications that such products must meet is critical and must be stringently enforced. In April, the regulator banned 28 sanitiser brands because they did not comply with the set standards.
 On Sunday, we reported that the Kebs banned another eight brands on the back of a rise in new Covid-19 cases. So far, no individual or company has been charged in a court of law for flouting the regulations and compromising public health safety.

Like "DC's Legends of Tomorrow," it's a reach way down into the superhero grab bag. Nevertheless, the series (produced by Johns along with Greg Berlanti, the architect behind DC's roster of CW shows such as "The Flash" and "Supergirl") has a playful energy, and enough narrative momentum to pull those who enjoy such fare through the five previewed episodes.
 Even by then, "Stargirl" hasn't made much of a dent in advancing the story, so patience is a virtue. Acts of actual heroism -- super or otherwise -- prove sporadic amid the Disney Channel-type teen troubles.
 Still, the overall effect is a better-than-average dip into TV superheroes, certainly compared to recent additions like the CW's dreary "Batwoman" or DC's latest stab at "Swamp Thing" (which, incidentally, will join "Stargirl" in streaming to the CW, as networks seek fresh content).
 The producers have described "Stargirl" as a throwback to the teen adventure movies of the 1980s, and it does possess an amusing small-town vibe. (The CW episodes, it's worth noting, run shorter than the DC Universe versions to make room for ads, but frankly, nobody should miss the excised content.)
 There is, admittedly, a formula to these shows, especially with a superhero- saturated CW lineup. "Stargirl" hardly seeks to reinvent the wheel, or even expand the mold. Still, its mix of solid characters, clever writing and youthful exuberance casts a brighter light than most.
  _"DC's Stargirl" premieres May 18 on DC Universe and May 19 at 8 p.m. on the CW. DC and Warner Bros. are owned by CNN's parent company, WarnerMedia._

In the administration's explanation of how it is distributing the relief funds, Medicaid providers are included in a catchall category at the very bottom of the list, under the heading "additional allocations."
 "To not see anything substantive coming from the federal level just adds insult to injury," said Todd Goodwin.
 He runs the John F. Murphy Homes in Auburn, Maine, which provides residential and day services to hundreds of children and adults with developmental and intellectual disabilities. He said his organization - which has already furloughed almost 300 workers and spent more than $200,000 on COVID-related expenses including purchases of essential equipment such as masks and protective equipment that will not be reimbursable - has not been eligible for any of the various aid programs passed by Congress. It gets most of its funding from Medicaid and public school systems.
 The organization has tapped a line of credit to stay afloat. "But if we're not here providing these services, there's no Plan B," he said.

 "The conditions there are perfect for young top players and their development. Bayer play attractive football and their training facilities are very good.

Other non-pharmaceutical interventions, like facemasks and hand-hygiene, reduce the effective contact, or the chance the virus is transmitted if there is contact. Universal masking may be particularly effective if we can't rely on symptomatic screening for identifying infectious cases.
 Or maybe you've heard of the layers of swiss cheese. Sometimes you have a few interventions (slices of Swiss cheese), but none are perfect (the holes). But stack the slices up, and the holes start to cover up. Layering imperfect interventions can, in a similar way, slow down transmission.
 ##  So what does it all mean?
 I once read a quote about the common cold from Ian Mackay, an Australian virologist: "The only fail-safe means of avoiding a cold is to live in complete isolation from the rest of humanity." The same is probably true for COVID-19.
 But that's not realistic. Authorities should borrow ideas from HIV prevention, and focus on clear messages for harm reduction. In the absence of stay-at-home orders, all of us will have to decide for ourselves how much risk we are willing to tolerate.

So, what should the PGA and European Tour do instead that weekend? Here's a suggestion: The Ryder Cup originally was conceived as a goodwill exhibition, so why not stage a rematch of one of the great Ryder Cups. There‚Äôs none better than the Battle at Brookline in 1999, but Payne Stewart is gone and the rest of the players are getting a little long in the tooth. No one's aching to see Jarmo Sandelin come out of retirement or Jeff Maggert don the stars and stripes again. But what about replaying the 2012 Miracle at Medinah instead? Do you think Keegan Bradley would like to unpack his suitcase finally, or Jim Furyk to have another shot at Sergio Garcia? Could Nicolas Colsaerts and Ian Poulter channel whatever they found eight years ago? Would the U.S. jump to a 10-6 lead again and would the ghost of Seve Ballesteros inspire another rousing comeback?

Many owners are also unhappy about the restrictions on how they can use the money. Restaurant owners, for example, say they need to use some of the money to buy food and other items to be able to reopen. While technically they can do that, they could not get forgiveness on the money spent for unapproved items. Some owners, fearing they won't get forgiveness, have said they're considering not using the money.

To begin to free humanity from the influence of the Corona Cult, it's important to understand how its programming took hold. Guilt - environmental guilt, racial guilt, class-based guilt - is the primary route of attack. The media establishment initially attempted to link the coronavirus outbreak to climate change, with even the Pope climbing on board the narrative, though no scientific basis exists to support it and it has since been somewhat de- emphasized. Heretics are repeatedly accused of prioritizing their own convenience over the health of society, especially its most vulnerable members - the elderly, the sick, even poor and non-white populations. Depending on the target audience, anti-lockdown heretics are said to be scientifically- illiterate "covidiots" or heartless monsters consigning the disadvantaged to die for capitalism. Guilt and shame are powerful conversion tools, and even those who remain unconverted are likely to hold their tongues in a sociological phenomenon known as the spiral of silence.

This guy was incredible, yet he was most comfortable being one of the guys. We hadn‚Äôt seen a player like him. He could score, he could defend, he could rebound. He was so confident. But underneath that, behind the scenes, I knew Michael Jordan was a country kid from North Carolina, and it was that simple to him. He was a young man, at heart, who wanted to be one of the guys who loved to play and was willing to do whatever was necessary.

Yes, I won't comment on these specific numbers, but yes there is -- the pipeline is huge. And I think to -- I think Lorne's points are all spot on. I guess probably the only other thing I would add to that is the idea of, let's say when the NBA comes back, I don't think that anybody is going to be watching two NBA players playing each other in NBA 2K. But I do think people will be betting on virtual sports as an event that's going off every four or five minutes just like they would be betting live NBA basketball. So I mean we feel very good about how our product actually sits alongside live sports and some launch point that's kind of improving over the years in Europe. And remember most of our customers here had their start in Europe and know all about this. So I think they see the potential for this in the States as well.

On the reservation, a lot of homes don't have running water or electricity. So our focus when we started was to help people who are living in superrural areas. We have a drive-up service where people can come to pick up food, but we also have a home-delivery system. Where we live right now has become the hot spot on the Navajo Nation, so we go to a lot of homes that are quarantined. We get names from other local health districts or the behavioral- health programs. They know about the elderly people who live deep in the canyons and have nobody, or if they're taking care of a disabled child. It's still cold here at night, so we deliver firewood. We haul water for livestock and for drinking, and we give out a lot of food packages.

But more than half that money has been allocated by the Department of Health and Human Services, and the majority of it so far has gone to hospitals, doctors and other facilities that serve Medicare patients. Officials said at the time that was an efficient way to get the money beginning to move to many providers. That, however, leaves out a large swath of the health system infrastructure that serves the low-income Medicaid population and children. Casa de Salud, for example, accepts Medicaid but not Medicare.
 State Medicaid directors say that without immediate funding, many of the health facilities that serve Medicaid patients could close permanently. More than a month ago, bipartisan Medicaid chiefs wrote the federal government asking for immediate authority to make "retainer" payments - not related to specific care for patients - to keep their health providers in business.
 "If we wait, core components of the Medicaid delivery system could fail during, or soon after, this pandemic," wrote the National Association of Medicaid Directors.
 So far, the Trump administration has not responded, although in early April it said it was "working rapidly on additional targeted distributions" for other providers, including those who predominately serve Medicaid patients.
 In an email, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services said officials there will "continue to work with states as they seek to ensure continued access to care for Medicaid beneficiaries through and beyond the public health emergency."
 CMS noted that states have several ways of boosting payments for Medicaid providers, but did not directly answer the question about the retainer payments that states are seeking the authority to make. Nor did it say when the funds would start to flow to Medicaid providers who do not also get funding from Medicare.
 The delay is frustrating Medicaid advocates.
 "This needs to be addressed urgently," said Joan Alker, executive director of Georgetown University's Center for Children and Families in Washington, D.C. "We are concerned about the infrastructure and how quickly it could evaporate."
