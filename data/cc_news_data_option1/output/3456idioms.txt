The San Jose City Council is expected to take a vote today on whether or not the Bay 101 and Casino M8trix, the city’s only two gambling facilities, should be allowed to operate outdoor casinos for the time being. The working idea is that the properties could put up massive tents and install certain gaming equipment inside, thereby better fulfilling social distancing and other health protocols. It’s seen as a win-win-win, as the casinos get revenue, the city gets revenue and the locals get a much-needed distraction.

San Jose is missing out on a serious amount of revenue with gaming facilities still shuttered. According to Raul Peralez of the City Council, “Currently, our city’s emergency order allows for a diverse array of business sectors to operate outdoors including now personal care businesses and retailers. However, permitted cardrooms, which in 2018-2019 generated $18.9 million in tax revenue, are not included in this list and that is a missed opportunity.” He adds, “With an estimated $100 million deficit looming over our city for the next two years, the city should leave no stone unturned when it comes to creating desperately needed tax dollars for our community.”

Despite hours of mind-numbing effort, I could not conquer "Battletoads" as a kid. The 1991 beat-'em up is notorious for its difficulty. It's a game that requires superhuman reflexes and monkish levels of patience.
 Taking on the classic on the NES or Xbox One is torture. Thumbs will ache, controllers will be thrown, tears will be shed and curses will reverberate through the house. It's a horrible experience, yet "Battletoads" is still revered among core gamers. Half the allure was its advanced visuals for the 8-bit age and the other part was that challenge. It was fun and rewarding to burgeoning masochists.
 Almost 26 years after the latest entry, "Battletoads Arcade," a follow-up has finally launched, rebooting the franchise. Developed by Dlala Studios and Rare, it has a drastically different look and updated gameplay. To some fans it could be apocryphal with its voiced characters and hand-drawn graphics, but after dying a few times on a turbo bike level and yelling expletives, they'll feel at home.
 "Battletoads" (2020) looks like a playable cartoon in the style of "Ren and Stimpy" or the "Fairy OddParents." Rash, Zitz and Pimple each have exaggerated features that separate them on screen. They also have unique sets of moves and attributes. Pimple, the burly one, moves slower but packs a punch while Rash is more agile and relies on splashier moves. Zitz is the best all-around fighter.
 The campaign begins with the Battletoads walking down the red carpet like celebrities, beating up the occasional ne'er-do-well. This introduction teaches players new moves, as well as the basics. Soon after, the trio realizes that they've been stuck in a virtual dome for more than two decades. The world has changed, and they're now nobodies who have to get a day job. It's a far cry from the Battletoads' heyday, when they were knocking the Dark Queen into outer space and saving the galaxy.
 "Battletoads" (2020) is self-aware of what it is and the developers play off that to excellent effect. It has a wry sense of humor as it puts the washed-up warriors in menial jobs, which are essentially mini games. It seems as if the amphibian warriors will fade into obscurity, until a series of events pits them against the Topians -- Uto and Pia.
 The two are comparable to the Celestials in the Marvel Universe and they are responsible for the Battletoads' long imprisonment. With that in mind, Rash, Zitz and Pimple head out to battle them after visiting a familiar foe.
 The adventure isn't a straight line to revenge though; instead, it takes several halting detours across four acts. They're jarring and more often played for forced laughs. Players will run into an episode that resembles "Weekend at Bernie's," while others are an excuse to bring puzzle elements and "Galaga"-style levels into the gameplay.
 Although "Battletoads" (2020) ends up sidetracked with these stages, Dlala and Rare do a surprisingly good job of mimicking the challenge of the original. The combat is more complex with the trio having light, heavy and morph attacks. Players will rely on an evasion button to dodge punches, while another button lets Zitz, Rash and Pimple spit gum to slow foes or lash a tongue out to eat health-giving flies.
 Overall, the fisticuffs are more complex, testing players' strategy as they figure out what adversaries to prioritize and how to use the new moves to finish foes off quickly. In the single-player mode, a gamer can cycle through each Battletoad during combat. If one loses all its health, it's defeated for a short time and players have to stay alive for that countdown to use the hero again. If all three faint, they must start over from a checkpoint.
 With all its complexity, the new moves don't always work well. Punching and kicking are fine, but the gum and tongue lash become unwieldy. As the screen fills with 15 foes, it's tough to target a specific one. Players will fire blindly, hoping somethings sticks. In the multiplayer mode, teammates can revive each other, but it also puts pressure on the whole squad to be great at combat. If one ally falls, they'll have to revive them and stay alive. The anarchy on screen makes the game harder.
 The other element that feels right is the vehicle and obstacle stages. This is where old "Battletoads" tested players' skill, and the new carries that same DNA. Players will jump aboard turbo bikes to race to a theme park by dodging walls and jumping over pits. It's an echo of the infamous Turbo Tunnel, but the difference here is that this challenge comes from a vertical perspective. It may look different, but it still requires split-second timing.
 That vibe carries over to the difficult Mis-treatied stage, which requires precise button presses as the toads glide and grind rails using an, ahem, makeshift sled. It's the campaign's hardest level. Other challenges come from outracing a pit of acid as players make their way down an obstacle course, or doing several timed puzzles in a row to save a ship from exploding.
 These stages are challenging, but with generous checkpoints and some perseverance, players can complete it. In the original, success was rewarded by a glimpse of what the next level looked like. In the reboot, the payoff comes from watching a long, animated cut-scene that could be mistaken for a Nickelodeon cartoon.
 "Battletoads" (2020) is nowhere near perfect, but it captures the essence of the original. The attempts to modernize it with more complex combat don't always work, just like the sidetracked adventures, but fans will appreciate the creativity involved. The game crackles with energy. Unfortunately, the developers couldn't harness that enthusiasm enough to put more of it in the right place.

There’s still talk about Bay 101 and Casino M8trix having to pay more in taxes starting next year as a result of the city’s revenue losses, and allowing the two properties to get back to work now will help ease that sting should it come. This November, local residents might see an entry on the ballot that would ask them whether or not the casinos should see their taxes increase from 15% to 16.5%, but would also allow the properties to increase the number of table games they offer by 15. The measure to include the item on the ballot was approved by the City Council 10-1.

With the progression of age, cartilages become prone to strain and fatigue due to less water content. This leads to arthritis and other complications, wherein connective tissues such as ligaments attached to the bones become less flexible and more constrained. These factors are expected to propel demand for foot orthotic insoles to ease out the pain. Lifestyle changes along with changes in eating habits lead to increase in obesity, which puts pressure on the joints in lower extremity and result in joint damage and other joint disorders. Increase in percentage of geriatric and obese populations is likely to propel the adoption rate of foot orthotic insoles during the forecast period. According to the American Association of Orthopedic Surgeons, the obese population is 20 times more likely to undergo knee replacement surgery compared to those who are not overweight. Prevalence of osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile arthritis, and other disorders is increasing primarily due to the aging population, obesity, and changes in lifestyle.

It is generally important to ensure that masks as well as any other protective gear come with the necessary certificates. Respiratory masks usually have to comply with European Regulation 2016/425/EU on personal protective equipment (PPE). The coronavirus crisis has seen protective equipment deemed acceptable despite a lack of appropriate documentation if it meets the standards of protection in the U.S., Canada, Australia, or Japan. At the same time, protective equipment has increasingly been introduced onto the market with forged certificates. The certificates should therefore be reviewed with a view to establishing whether they are authentic and plausible.
