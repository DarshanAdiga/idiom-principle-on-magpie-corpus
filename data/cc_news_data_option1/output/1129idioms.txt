An employer with 10 employees might have enough work to keep them all occupied half time. This policy gives a very clear incentive to furlough half of them and keep half of them on full time.
 'There may also be concerns about policing this especially for owner-managed companies paying wages to the owner.'
 Moments earlier, Prime Minister Boris Johnson ordered the closure of pubs, restaurants, gyms and other businesses from Friday to slow the spread of the virus.
 Sterling lost about a cent against the U.S. dollar and the euro as Mr Johnson announced the shutdown and his chancellor set out measures to mitigate its impact.
 The package of measures rushed out by the government this month could push Britain's budget deficit back to 10% of gross domestic product, its peak after the global financial crisis, JP Morgan economist Allan Monks said.
 'A war-time style temporary surge in borrowing is in prospect,' said Martin Beck, at Oxford Economics.
 On Thursday, the Bank of England announced a 200 billion-pound increase in its bond-buying programme as well as a cut in interest rates to a new all-time low of 0.1%.
 Mr Sunak, a 39 year-old former Goldman Sachs analyst who has been in the job for just over a month, said the wages support system would be up and running by the end of April, run for at least three months and be backdated to March 1.
 Other measures included an extra 7 billion pounds for the welfare system.
 The plan was welcomed by Britain's biggest trade union, underscoring how the crisis has forced the ruling Conservative Party to abandon its traditional market-led instincts and put the state at the centre of the economy, at least for now.
 'People concerned about their jobs and livelihoods will feel hugely reassured today that the chancellor has acted swiftly,' said Dave Prentis, general secretary of UNISON.
 Adam Marshall, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, urged the government 'to go foot-to-floor' to help firms as soon as possible.
 Sunak said a new loan programme for small firms he announced this week would be running by Monday when further measures for the sector would be announced. The loans will be available for 12 months, twice as long as previously planned.
 Deutsche Bank said earlier on Friday that Britain's economy was set to shrink by 4% in 2020 and the unemployment rate could more than double to over 8%. If the crisis proved deeper than thought, the economy could shrink by 6% for its worst recession in a century.
 Other countries are also scrambling to temper the impact of the their clamp- downs to slow the spread of coronavirus.
 In the United States, the Trump administration and Congress are negotiating a $1 trillion-plus package including sending checks of up to $1,200 to individuals, help for small firms and their staff and support for the health system.

NEW DELHI (IANS) — A teenager, who was a sparring partner for the Taiwanese (Chinese Taipei) badminton team has tested positive for coronavirus, drawing concern from Indian badminton players.
 The teenager, according to a Taiwanese report that was tweeted by Danish player Hans-Kristian Vittinghus, was part of the Taiwanese contingent for the All England Championships.
 Indian players Saina Nehwal, HS Prannoy, Ashwini Ponnappa, Parupalli Kashyap and Ajay Jayaram were among players who showed their concern over the development by reacting to Vittinghus' tweet. "No way ... really really shocked," Saina said.
 Saina had earlier slammed the organizers of the All England Championships, saying that they had placed financial gains above the safety of the players in organizing it without any restrictions among the coronavirus pandemic. The tournament was held from March 11 to 15 with no restrictions on stadium attendances.
 "Only thing I can think of is that rather than the players welfare n feelings, financial reasons were given more importance. Otherwise there was no other reason for the #AllEnglandOpen2020 to go on last week. #QuarantineLife," Saina had tweeted.
 The under-fire Badminton World Federation announced March 20 the cancellation of five events, including the continental tournaments Asian Championships, Pan Am Individual Championships and European Championships.

Her greatest achievements in her final two years came as she focused more on distance, a skill aided by another local, 2009 Perkiomen Valley graduate Bridget Hilferty, who is a Huskies assistant coach since capping her own All- American career at Bloom in 2013.
 “(My breakthrough was) learning how to do distance. Having Coach Bridget as a specialty coach in distance, I really worked every single day in practice at my distance swimming,” Cubbler said. “I had one race where everything just clicked. From then on I knew my pace, everything I have to do, I know if I miss up a flip-turn I know exactly why, so it’s all been a learning process.
 “My four years have been more than I ever dreamed of. I never thought I would be going to NCAAs for four years.”
 Dix has his own remarkable resume with two individual Bloomsburg records (200 free, 100 butterfly) and four school and PSAC conference records, which were established in Dix’s sophomore season that featured silver and bronze finishes at NCAAs in the 200 free relay and 200 medley relay, respectively.
 Dix’s swimming career was placed on hold as a junior, his medical redshirt year, when he underwent double shoulder surgery. It could have been a career- ender for some, but that was never a consideration in Dix’s mind.
 “No, not even a little bit. Anyone who knows me, I’m way too competitive, overly competitive. So I knew no matter what I was going to try to compete again,” Dix said. “I wasn’t sure if I was ever going to be able to get back (to my past level) because it can be catastrophic to your career with shoulders, but I think I knew in the back of my mind, even as they were telling me I might not ever be back, I knew I was going to be back.
 “It’s just about being mentally tough. If you want something to happen, you can make it happen. It just depends on how much you want it.”
 It wasn’t without its challenges though, like a rehabilitation process that taught Dix what it was like to be a fish.
 “It was no movement at all for a month after each surgery, which I had two months apart. Once I was able to get back in the pool, my coach would saran wrap my arms together and I would just kick. I would just kick because I wasn’t allowed to even risk moving my arms at all,” he said. “So I would just saran wrap my arms and just kick, and then that happened for a couple months and then eventually moved on to small strokes.
 “It normally takes eight months, but I was able to get back in 6-6½ months from when I was able to start swimming again.”
 But most of all, Dix was determined to not let his injuries define him in any way.
 “I just wanted to put the injury behind me as something that happened but I’m not going to let that hold me back. I’m going to let my hard work show out and prevail through that. I gave it my all, I overcame that, now that’s behind me and now I’m an athlete again,” Dix said of his mindset.
 “I really think that helped me grow in the end, and realize that not everything is permanent. It gave me more confidence heading into the rest of my career knowing that if I can get through that, I can get through anything.”
 Dix returned in 2018-19 and won the PSAC championship in the 100 breast, 400 free relay and the 100 butterfly, where he set a PSAC meet record, qualifying for NCAAs in three events. This winter, Dix repeated as 100 breaststroke champion, placed second in the 100 free, won three relay titles at PSACs, including the NCAA-qualifying run for the 200 free relay team that ensured Dix’s career would rightfully end at the NCAA Championships.
 Wins or trips to NCAAs won’t be how Dix defines his career, though.
 “I don’t think a single year defines how your career is represented. Things happen and you don’t always have your best swim, but if you look back on your progress and the people you were able to help influence on the way, I think that’s what defines your career, the relationships and everything you’ve done to give back to the sport.
 “I wouldn’t say my highlight was anything directly in the pool. It’s the way that my teammates have told me that I’ve helped them improve and lead them as a captain. I think my highlight was being a captain for three years and giving everything I had to help us make each other better.”
 Dix will graduate in May while Cubbler, an elementary education major, will be student teaching in the fall after finishing her course work this spring.
 Both have visions of staying near the pool in a coaching capacity, ensuring a surprise event cancellation isn’t the final note of their time in the swimming world.
 “Sometimes I think I like coaching more than I like swimming itself,” Dix said. “I was the head coach of the Skippack swim team over the summer and that was so rewarding. I would love to be involved in the swimming world in some form.
 “It’s so rewarding to give back to those when you were once in their position. I know exactly what they’re going through,I know practices hurt, I know what hurts, what doesn’t, I can just relate. It makes it easy, something I’ve been around for 16 years and it was what I was good at.”
