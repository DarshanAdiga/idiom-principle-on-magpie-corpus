In the biggest transition for the computer brand since the move from the Power PC processor to Intel chips - unveiled at WWDC 2005 by Steve Jobs - the Mac was now going to move to "our own Apple Silicon."
 There was no mention of ARM, the UK-based but now Japanese-owned firm whose chip designs now dominate the world of mobile computing.
 But it is clear that soon Macs - just like iPhones and iPads - will be powered by processors based on ARM designs.
 It had seemed a while back that the Mac might fade in importance, as Apple pushed the iPad as the one computer you needed.
 But Carolina Milanesi of Creative Strategies says that hasn't happened, and with a common chip platform meaning iOS apps can be ported to the Mac, consumers can be offered new choices.
 "Now you can have a Mac that feels like an iPad. So it's opening up that opportunity of an iPad-like experience in a form factor that at the end of the day is what people still want, which is more a laptop traditional form factor," she said.
 Over time, many firms outsource several key elements of their products.
 What Apple has done once again is shown how determined it is to be in control of every aspect of what it sells, from hardware to software and the retail environment in which consumers encounter its Macs and iPads, its Apple Watches and iPhones.
 Even when it opens up a platform like the App Store to external developers it exerts strict control over what's on sale - and takes a healthy cut.

The winning train keeps on going for the Dallas Center-Grimes baseball team as they doubled up Pella Christian Thursday night at home.
   
 Across 12 hits and 17 runs, DCG walked away from Dallas Center still without a loss as they bested the visiting Eagles in game one 8-6 followed by a 9-2 game two victory. The Mustangs now have their best nine-game start in ten years.
   
 Despite the outcome, game one for the Mustangs began on an inauspicious note as Pella Christian kicked off the game with a two-run home run. What's a team like DCG to do? They doubled up the scoring efforts and more by striking seven runs in the bottom half of the first inning to quickly take a 7-2 advantage. While some winning teams find an advantage in the hit column as well as the run column, the Mustangs were able to plate more runs on just six hits. Pella Christian struck for ten hits in the loss.
   
 Across that first inning, DCG used just two hits to produce the seven runs. Jordan Sedivec produced a run-scoring double while Bryce Jermeier's single- turned-triple also plated one run. The rest of the first inning offense for the Mustangs came from three walks, a Pella Christian error, and a sacrifice fly RBI by senior Cole Wessling. The Eagles added three more runs in the fourth inning to cut the lead thin 7-6 after the top half of the fourth inning but the Mustangs once again answered, increasing their lead to an 8-6 margin. Good pitching between kept the visiting Eagles to just one hit across the final three innings of play and from that the Mustangs strolled to an 8-6 win.
   
 On the mound, sophomore Huston Halverson led the way with four innings of work and striking out two and walking one, while allowing five earned runs. Chase Stratton also held mound duties and struck out three while allowing no runs to cross the plate. Caleb Spence also added two strikeouts as well.
   
 First inning success followed the Mustangs into game two as they used an eight-run first inning to propel themselves to a 9-2 victory. DCG had six hits total and four of them came in the first inning alone. The inning for DCG kicked off when Caden Grimes reached on a drop third strike followed by a Caleb Dicken walk. The scoring action for the Mustangs came on a Colby Wigham single to center field for a 1-0 lead. Wigham was one of two Mustangs in the game to plate two runs off of his bat. The other was Jordan Sedviec who plated both of his runs in the first inning with a two-run double to left. Sedivec then made his way back to home plate to score via a Logan Smith single. A wild pitch and a Chase Stratton single pushed the DCG lead to a 7-0 mark. Grimes added the final first-inning run on a sacrifice fly as the lineup turned over for the second time in a first inning in the last two games.
   
 The Mustangs tacked on one more run in the sixth to answer a fifth and sixth inning run by the Eagles and brought the final score to its final resting place of 9-2. Leading the way on the mound for the Mustangs was Dicken who went three and two-thirds and worked pretty efficiently striking out four and allowing just two hits and a pair of walks. Brock Junge totaled two innings and struck out four along with allowing just one hit.
   
 With the doubleheader sweep, the Mustangs are now 9-0 through two weeks of action. Next up for the Mustangs will be a single game outing on the road against Pella on Monday, June 29. There they will seek to capture their fourth straight win over the Dutch and break the 20 tie with both squads even at ten wins each over the other since the 2012 campaign.

LOEWE x Divine 'Labeled as the filthiest person alive and seen in such movies as Pink Flamingos, Hairspray and Lust in The Dust and in theater plays such as The Neon Woman, has had a huge impact on popular culture. He preempted the glorification of trash, the mix of high and low, the fantastic erasure of gender barriers. I thought it was time to celebrate him, the LOEWE way: with a capsule collection inspired by his looks and a museum exhibition honoring his artistry. Of course, current events have impacted the scale of our efforts. Due to the ongoing global pandemic, production was halted in order to keep our artisans and workers safe. And right now, LGBTQ+ Pride celebrations all over are recalibrating, as organizers and activists work to rightfully reclaim these avenues as a form of protest, joining the movement for Black Lives. We support their efforts. To better meet this moment, we have staged an online exhibition of Divine memorabilia and pictures, which was initially planned as part of our exhibition for PhotoEspaña Madrid at our Gran Vía store in Madrid.' - @Jonathan.Anderson Fifteen percent of the proceeds will be donated to Visual AIDS, an organization which utilizes art to fight HIV/AIDS by provoking dialogue, supporting artists living with HIV, and preserving a legacy. We know from our ongoing partnership with Visual AIDS that the HIV/AIDS crisis is not over. We join them in their ongoing fight against the virus and their efforts to preserve our history. Additionally, we are pleased to make a donation to Baltimore Pride, which is important to us for two reasons. Firstly, it is the hometown of Divine and the setting for the film Hairspray. But additionally and more importantly, Baltimore Pride is a Black- led LGBTQ+ organization and celebration. We are honored to support their work. See the collection on loewe.com #LOEWE #LOEWEdivine

After ending last week as road warriors, the Van Meter High School softball team kept it going Tuesday night as they traveled to battle non-conference foe Clarke High School.
   
 Despite a rough start, the Bulldogs ended up pulling things together late to end their losing skid and win 7-5. Van Meter came off of a three-game losing skid and put an end to that courtesy of five runs scored across the final two innings of play against the Indians. Van Meter returned back to normal form, being rather efficient with their scoring efforts as they touched up seven runs on just eight total hits. Despite the outcome, the battle began quite inauspicious for the Bulldogs as the watched the visiting Indians post up a 3-0 advantage following the third inning of play.
   
 Van Meter ended up answering with offense of their own, plating two runs in the fourth inning to cut the lead down to one heading into the fifth inning. Overall, there were only two scoreless innings across the whole game, and for both teams, they came in the first two innings of action. Following Van Meter's answer in the fourth, the host Indians added two more runs in the bottom of the fifth, widening the Bulldogs' deficit 5-2 as the sixth inning approached. From there the Van Meter offense seemed to step it up a notch. They kicked off the sixth inning by plating three runs to even out the score at five runs apiece. When Clarke couldn't answer in the bottom half of the sixth inning, Van Meter took advantage by posting up two more runs in the top half of the seventh inning. That gave the Bulldogs their first and only lead of the game 7-5 which they would then ride out to their fifth overall victory of the 2020 campaign.
   
 Overall there was plenty of offense to be happy with for coach James Flaws and the Bulldogs. That included a highlight performance by sophomore Shea Rhodes who went 1-for-3 on the night with that one hit exiting the playing field for a three-run home run. The trio of Maia Abrahamson, Lilly Thompson, and Mac Blomgren also had games to remember, all striking two hits for the contest. Aside from Rhodes and her home run, the other Bulldogs who drove in runs were Thompson, Macy Blomgren, and Molly Blomgren.
   
 Inside the circle, the pitching duties belonged to Macy Blomgren who once again showcased her skill very well. The freshman pitched the full seven innings and 151 total pitches while dishing out a season-second best mark of eleven strikeouts. Blomgren also issued just three walks and two earned runs for the contest.
   
 Next up for the newly minted 5-5 Bulldogs will be a return trip back home where they will battle conference foe ACGC in a doubleheader beginning with game one first pitch at 5:30 p.m.

Cherry, who is seen as a potential leadership rival to Sturgeon, has been careful to keep her distance from calls for a simple declaration of independence, preferring a legal challenge backed by a majority vote in Holyrood.
 However, her call for a more open debate on the whole issue could add fuel an internal rebellion against the SNP leader.
 An opinion poll last week found that 54 per cent of Scots would vote yes, the second survey in a row during lockdown to return a majority for independence.
 Cherry said: “The time for avoiding discussion of ‘plan B’ is over. That discussion and proposals like those of the Common Weal for a resilient Scotland should be centre stage if, as mooted, the SNP conference and national assemblies go online this autumn.”

 Thanks to a big fourth inning, the Dallas Center-Grimes baseball team picked up their seventh straight win in a 5-0 victory over conference foe Indianola.
 Efficiency could very well describe the Mustangs and their offensive production. DCG plated those five runs on just four hits in what was a pitching duel for the most part. Seniors Chase Stratton, Logan Smith, and Colby Wigham along with junior Jordan Sedivec all picked up hits in the contest. Wigham, Sedivec, Bryce Jermeier, and Cody Hall were responsible for four of the five runs that crossed the plate for DCG.
 The visiting Indians actually kicked off the overall scoring, staking an early 1-0 lead in the top half of the second inning. The DCG offense truly was funneled into one single inning which turned out to be the fourth inning of action. Two walks and a Chase Stratton single set the stage for Sedivec to strike for his only RBI of the game, doing so on a single to center field. Hall followed that up with a hard-hit ball that forced an Indianola error for the first and only needed lead of the game for the Mustangs.
 Bryce Jermeier joined the scoring parade but he did so with patience as with the bases already full of Mustangs, the senior watched four straight pitches go by for balls which earned him a free pass to first and brought home one more run. Boley reaching on an error and a Wigham RBI ground-out produced the final two runs of the inning and ultimately the game as the defense held strong for the 5-1 victory.
 On the mound, just two pitchers were needed to capture the win for the Mustangs. For a third straight outing, Logan Smith dazzled on the mound, allowing just three hits and the first earned run against him this season. It marked the second straight outing of eight or more strikeouts for Smith as he dished out exactly eight strikeouts against the Indians Wednesday night. All that came with issuing just one walk.
 The win has now provided DCG their best seven-game start to a season since the 2012 campaign when they started the season 8-0. The Mustangs will have the chance to earn their best start in over ten years as they take on Pella Christian Thursday, June 25 in a doubleheader battle in Dallas Center. Since 2014, DCG holds the match-up advantage winning 11 of the last 16 contests against the Eagles. Game one from Dallas Center is set to get the doubleheader started with first pitch at 5:30 p.m.

 The winning train keeps on going for the Dallas Center-Grimes baseball team as they doubled up Pella Christian Thursday night at home.
 Across 12 hits and 17 runs, DCG walked away from Dallas Center still without a loss as they bested the visiting Eagles in game one 8-6 followed by a 9-2 game two victory. The Mustangs now have their best nine-game start in ten years.

The challenge has certainly been there for the Waukee High School baseball team this week. The Warriors began the week up against reigning Class 4A champion Urbandale and moved on to fellow Class 4A title game participant Johnston High School.
   
 Both matchups ended in a doubleheader split for the Warriors. Waukee kicked things off with an extra-inning 3-2 victory in game one and then met heavy offense in game two, falling 11-7. Thirteen hits made up the Urbandale doubleheader for the Warriors and six of those hits came in the nine-inning game one marathon. Game one was actually a defensive and pitching battle between two future University of Iowa baseball stars in Urbandale's Ty Langenberg and Waukee's Jackson Payne. Both pitchers battled and at the end of seven full innings, neither team had found a way to cross the plate. The bulk of the offense for both teams came in the eighth inning as both the Warriors and the J-Hawks produced two runs. That still didn't decide a victor and in the ninth inning, it was Waukee to finally pull ahead with one run in the ninth inning that was not answered by Urbandale. Payne ended up dishing out a seson-high 16 strikeouts and allowing just one hit through seven innings.
   
 Game two was the exact opposite of game one with 18 combined runs and 17 combined hits. Right from the get-go, it was Urbandale who showed off their offense, putting Waukee in a 6-0 deficit following the first inning. They added three more runs in the second inning and before fans could blink, Waukee was in a 9-0 hole. Slowly throughout the rest of the contest Waukee chipped away at Urbandale's lead with one run in the third and fourth innings, a three-run sixth inning and a two-run seventh inning. Junior Aiden McGee led the way offensively in game two with two hits, the only Warrior batter to do so. Ultimately there were only two RBI's accounted for with Cooper Crouse and Parker Hirsch. On the mound, the Warriors ended up employing a three-pitcher crew. Camden Kaufman went the longest with four innings of work, striking out four and walking just three with three hits allowed. The loss overall for the Warriors marked their second loss of the 2020 campaign.
   
 On Wednesday, June 24, the Warriors came back home for a doubleheader battle with Johnston in two lopsided affairs. Waukee produced ten hits in the 12-3 game one win over the Dragons but delivered on just two hits in the 18-0 game two loss.
   
 Game one was quite the scoring frenzy as Waukee scored in all but two innings. The only deficit the Warriors faced in game one came in the top of the first when Johnston pushed one run across home plate. From there it was all Waukee as the Warriors put up four runs in the bottom half of the first for a 4-1 early lead. Thanks to a three-run second inning, a two-run third inning, and a two-run fourth inning, that small early lead blossomed into an 11-2 advantage entering the fifth inning. Both the Warriors and the Dragons added in one run each across the final three innings of play before Waukee ended things off with a 12-3 win. Jalen Martinez had a strong outing striking two hits in four trips to the plate, including his second home run of the season. Martinez drove in three runs in the contest and now leads the Warriors with 11 total runs driven in. Jackson Wentworth went five strong innings on the mound, striking out eight batters while walking two and allowing just one hit.
   
 Game two was quite a different story for the Warriors. In an almost mirrored version of game one, Waukee found themselves down early 4-0 following the first inning. That doubled to an 8-0 deficit following four innings of play. The big blow for Waukee came in the fifth inning where Johnston produced a season-high ten single inning runs, forcing Waukee to end the game early for the first time in several years. Offensively for the Warriors, Alex Walsh was the only batter to strike a hit wracking up two doubles. Waukee used four pitchers in the contest, with Jacob Barton issuing the most strikeouts with three while Matthew Jongerius and Colin Evers producing a pair of strikeouts each.
   
 Overall, the Warriors will enter their Friday contest with a mark of 7-3. Next up on the docket for Waukee will be a road matchup against Ankeny on Friday, May 26 with game one of the doubleheader beginning at 5 p.m.

 After ending last week as road warriors, the Van Meter High School softball team kept it going Tuesday night as they traveled to battle non-conference foe Clarke High School.
 Despite a rough start, the Bulldogs ended up pulling things together late to end their losing skid and win 7-5. Van Meter came off of a three-game losing skid and put an end to that courtesy of five runs scored across the final two innings of play against the Indians. Van Meter returned back to normal form, being rather efficient with their scoring efforts as they touched up seven runs on just eight total hits. Despite the outcome, the battle began quite inauspicious for the Bulldogs as the watched the visiting Indians post up a 3-0 advantage following the third inning of play.
 Van Meter ended up answering with offense of their own, plating two runs in the fourth inning to cut the lead down to one heading into the fifth inning. Overall, there were only two scoreless innings across the whole game, and for both teams, they came in the first two innings of action. Following Van Meter's answer in the fourth, the host Indians added two more runs in the bottom of the fifth, widening the Bulldogs' deficit 5-2 as the sixth inning approached. From there the Van Meter offense seemed to step it up a notch. They kicked off the sixth inning by plating three runs to even out the score at five runs apiece. When Clarke couldn't answer in the bottom half of the sixth inning, Van Meter took advantage by posting up two more runs in the top half of the seventh inning. That gave the Bulldogs their first and only lead of the game 7-5 which they would then ride out to their fifth overall victory of the 2020 campaign.
 Overall there was plenty of offense to be happy with for coach James Flaws and the Bulldogs. That included a highlight performance by sophomore Shea Rhodes who went 1-for-3 on the night with that one hit exiting the playing field for a three-run home run. The trio of Maia Abrahamson, Lilly Thompson, and Mac Blomgren also had games to remember, all striking two hits for the contest. Aside from Rhodes and her home run, the other Bulldogs who drove in runs were Thompson, Macy Blomgren, and Molly Blomgren.
 Inside the circle, the pitching duties belonged to Macy Blomgren who once again showcased her skill very well. The freshman pitched the full seven innings and 151 total pitches while dishing out a season-second best mark of eleven strikeouts. Blomgren also issued just three walks and two earned runs for the contest.
 Next up for the newly minted 5-5 Bulldogs will be a return trip back home where they will battle conference foe ACGC in a doubleheader beginning with game one first pitch at 5:30 p.m.

Thanks to a big fourth inning, the Dallas Center-Grimes baseball team picked up their seventh straight win in a 5-0 victory over conference foe Indianola.
   
 Efficiency could very well describe the Mustangs and their offensive production. DCG plated those five runs on just four hits in what was a pitching duel for the most part. Seniors Chase Stratton, Logan Smith, and Colby Wigham along with junior Jordan Sedivec all picked up hits in the contest. Wigham, Sedivec, Bryce Jermeier, and Cody Hall were responsible for four of the five runs that crossed the plate for DCG.
   
 The visiting Indians actually kicked off the overall scoring, staking an early 1-0 lead in the top half of the second inning. The DCG offense truly was funneled into one single inning which turned out to be the fourth inning of action. Two walks and a Chase Stratton single set the stage for Sedivec to strike for his only RBI of the game, doing so on a single to center field. Hall followed that up with a hard-hit ball that forced an Indianola error for the first and only needed lead of the game for the Mustangs.
   
 Bryce Jermeier joined the scoring parade but he did so with patience as with the bases already full of Mustangs, the senior watched four straight pitches go by for balls which earned him a free pass to first and brought home one more run. Boley reaching on an error and a Wigham RBI ground-out produced the final two runs of the inning and ultimately the game as the defense held strong for the 5-1 victory.
   
 On the mound, just two pitchers were needed to capture the win for the Mustangs. For a third straight outing, Logan Smith dazzled on the mound, allowing just three hits and the first earned run against him this season. It marked the second straight outing of eight or more strikeouts for Smith as he dished out exactly eight strikeouts against the Indians Wednesday night. All that came with issuing just one walk.
   
 The win has now provided DCG their best seven-game start to a season since the 2012 campaign when they started the season 8-0. The Mustangs will have the chance to earn their best start in over ten years as they take on Pella Christian Thursday, June 25 in a doubleheader battle in Dallas Center. Since 2014, DCG holds the match-up advantage winning 11 of the last 16 contests against the Eagles. Game one from Dallas Center is set to get the doubleheader started with first pitch at 5:30 p.m.

 For just the first time this season, the Class 4A fifth-ranked Dallas Center- Grimes softball team was unable to plate a single run Wednesday night in Dallas Center. The Mustangs were battling it out with Class 5A seventh-ranked Indianola despite a six-hit performance, suffered their second loss of the season 3-0.
 It was an early 2-0 Indians lead and strong pitching that stifled the DCG lineup for their largest loss of the season. The game began quite inauspiciously for the Mustangs as Indianola struck a two-run home run in the very first inning. Indianola ended up capturing one more run in the top half of the fifth and that would be the extent of the scoring efforts across both teams.
 For the Mustangs, while they did suffer their first shutout loss of the season, they still put forth a strong performance which included six hits. The top five of DCG's lineup is where the most production came from as Elle Nelsen, Kylie Merical, Ryley Hall, Molly Cooney, and Kamryn O'Brien captured hits. Morgan Rosenbeck also chipped in a hit for the contest. Both Hall and Rosenbeck captured doubles on the night. For the silver linings, the DCG offense left just five runners stranded on base and struck out just four times across all seven innings played.
 Inside the circle, despite the loss, it was a very strong night for Hall. The senior hurler went the full seven innings and needed just 83 pitches overall to complete the game. She allowed six hits for the contest but allowed just two walks while dishing out four strikeouts.
 The loss for DCG now drops their record to 7-2 overall and their first conference loss of the 2020 campaign. The Mustangs will seek to turn their recent tides as they welcome in conference foe Pella Christian for a double- header battle tonight with game one first pitch set for 5:30 p.m.

COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) — A court in Denmark on Friday found a 40-year-old Norwegian man of Iranian descent guilty of spying for Iran and accessory to attempts to commit murder on Danish soil. The man, who was not identified by the court, “collected information about an exiled Iranian in Denmark” during the period Sept. 25-27, 2018. The Roskilde city court, west of Copenhagen, said it was “proven” that the information was handed over to a person working for an unnamed Iranian intelligence service. It added that online chats between the defendant and the person working for the Iranian intelligence service “weighed in” as evidence. Roskilde is about 40 kilometers (25 miles) west of Copenhagen. The court said the man must have realized his activities for an Iranian intelligence agency are illegal under Danish law and punishable by up to six years in prison. The court also said he must have known his activities helped the Iranian intelligence service prepare for an attempted murder, making him an accessory to attempted murder. In a statement, the court said the defendant pleaded not guilty and had declined to speak during the trial, which was held behind closed doors. The case is linked to a 2018 police operation targeting an alleged Iranian plot to kill one or more opponents of the Iranian government. The operation briefly cut off the island on which Copenhagen sits from the rest of Denmark. As part of the investigation, three men who are members of an Iranian separatist group, the Arab Struggle Movement for the Liberation of Ahwaz, were accused of spying in Denmark for an unnamed Saudi intelligence service. The three men of the London-based group were arrested in February in Ringsted, 60 kilometers (40 miles) southwest of Copenhagen, suspected of spying...

 Infection rates are one measure being considered, but so is how the relevant countries are tackling the Covid-19 epidemic and whether they have adequate testing and tracing regimes in place.
 Travellers from the US, Brazil and Russia are unlikely to be allowed in, and the initial number of countries given the green light may be small.

Erica Cheatham, a wellness coach, and Chasity Davis, a cosmetologist, have known each other for almost 10 years. They used to have salon studios next to each other in Urbandale. Now, they are partnering to bring a healthy option to Adel.
   
 TRU2U Nutrition, owned by Cheatham, has had pop ups at Texture Salon in Adel since June 12, serving plant-based shakes and energy drinks. The shakes have 21 vitamins and minerals and 24g of protein and the energy drinks have B6/B12 vitamins.
   
 "I have a passion for serving others and making them feel good," Cheatham said. "I was a hairstylist for nine years and what fires me up is to give people confidence and truly feel good, not only on the outside, but inside. We only have one body and how we choose to treat it is up to us."
   
 Cheatham started volunteering at a similar nutrition club and loved the whole concept and community and began setting herself up to open her own club. Cheatham has been with the Herbalife company for eight years and just recently celebrated her TRU2U Nutrition club's 2nd year at her location in Grimes.
   
 The Grimes location hours are 7 a.m.-1:30 p.m. Monday-Friday with Saturday pop ups. In Adel, they have been doing pop ups on Wednesdays and Fridays from 7-10 a.m. at Texture Salon, 608 Greene St. in Adel.
   
 "They [pop ups] are not set hours or days. They have flexibility to change," Cheatham said. "We have a very active Facebook and Instagram for our permanent location, which is Tru2U Nutrition. For Adel, we have a Facebook page that I try to keep updated as to when we are coming and that page is called, Adel Tru2u Nutrition Pop Up."
   
 During COVID-19, TRU2U Nutrition was deemed essential, so they were allowed to stay open when many places had to close. Cheatham wanted to bring her products to her Adel customers that were staying home. They also had curbside and call ahead carry out in Grimes.
   
 "We have just recently opened up a little more with a few tables out," Cheatham said. "I have many customers from Adel that come into my Grimes location, which I was made aware of after getting to know them. They kept telling me I needed to bring it to Adel, so I reached out to Chasity."
   
 At first, she started out making the shakes and drinks at their club in Grimes, putting everything on ice, and then having a pickup location in Adel.
   
 "This continued to grow over the weeks and we needed to find a place to physically make them as we were maxed out with transporting," Cheatham said.
   
 Texture Salon wasn't being utilized during the COVID-19 shutdown, so during this time, the women agreed to make Texture Salon the official Adel pop up location, until a permanent location could be acquired.
   
 There is an app to place an order on the Adel Tru2u Nutrition Pop Up Facebook page. She shared that people typically walk in and fill out a ticket to place their order. They accept cash, credit card and Venmo. Customers have provided Cheatham with positive feedback.
   
 "They love the energy they get and how well they feel the rest of the day," she said.
   
 She hopes that the partnership with Texture Salon helps people choose a healthy option. She also hopes to find a permanent location and coaches that want to share the lifestyle. After all, her favorite thing about TRU2U Nutrition is the relationship with the community members.
   
 "I am grateful to be able to work with Chasity and allow Adel to get a taste of what we offer, but also who I am as a person and what my end goal is for your community, which is to give Adel's community access to a healthy lifestyle," Cheatham said.
   
 Texture Salon, formerly named Hair Affair, was founded in 2015. This salon is one of the oldest salons in Adel, which has lasted 35+ years. Davis, owner of Texture Salon, is a native of Adel and loved the feel of the community and what it had to offer.
   
 "We offer cuts for the entire family, color, highlights and facial waxing," Davis said. "Most of our clients receive more than one service per appointment. Most receive a cut and color or a cut and wax."
   
 The business hours for Texture Salon are by appointment only, Tuesday 9 a.m. - 8 p.m., Wednesday 12-8 p.m., Thursday 9 a.m. - 8 p.m. and closed on Saturdays. Cash, credit card and check are the forms of payment accepted at Texture Salon. To schedule an appointment, call 515-993-4992 or there is online scheduling at vagaro.com/texturesalonspa.
   
 COVID-19 closed Texture Salon for 12 weeks.
   
 "We are taking extra precautions recommended by the IDPH and the state cosmetology board," Davis said. "Each client is asked to fill out a COVID-19 screening prior to their appointment and if they have experienced any symptoms or show any signs of illness are asked to reschedule at a later date."
   
 Hair products may also be purchased at Texture Salon. Right now, the stylists sell their favorite professional hair care products. Maria Nila and Neuma, which are both vegan and cruelty free, are currently available. They also have 18.21 Man Made for the men and select VERB, Matrix and Kenra products.
   
 "I'm excited to bring old and new faces into both the salon and the nutrition shop with this partnership," Davis said. "I love that TRU2U brings a new opportunity to town and that the girls are very upbeat and personable. We absolutely can't wait to see where the rest of the year takes us!"

 The challenge has certainly been there for the Waukee High School baseball team this week. The Warriors began the week up against reigning Class 4A champion Urbandale and moved on to fellow Class 4A title game participant Johnston High School.
 Both matchups ended in a doubleheader split for the Warriors. Waukee kicked things off with an extra-inning 3-2 victory in game one and then met heavy offense in game two, falling 11-7. Thirteen hits made up the Urbandale doubleheader for the Warriors and six of those hits came in the nine-inning game one marathon. Game one was actually a defensive and pitching battle between two future University of Iowa baseball stars in Urbandale's Ty Langenberg and Waukee's Jackson Payne. Both pitchers battled and at the end of seven full innings, neither team had found a way to cross the plate. The bulk of the offense for both teams came in the eighth inning as both the Warriors and the J-Hawks produced two runs. That still didn't decide a victor and in the ninth inning, it was Waukee to finally pull ahead with one run in the ninth inning that was not answered by Urbandale. Payne ended up dishing out a seson-high 16 strikeouts and allowing just one hit through seven innings.
 Game two was the exact opposite of game one with 18 combined runs and 17 combined hits. Right from the get-go, it was Urbandale who showed off their offense, putting Waukee in a 6-0 deficit following the first inning. They added three more runs in the second inning and before fans could blink, Waukee was in a 9-0 hole. Slowly throughout the rest of the contest Waukee chipped away at Urbandale's lead with one run in the third and fourth innings, a three-run sixth inning and a two-run seventh inning. Junior Aiden McGee led the way offensively in game two with two hits, the only Warrior batter to do so. Ultimately there were only two RBI's accounted for with Cooper Crouse and Parker Hirsch. On the mound, the Warriors ended up employing a three-pitcher crew. Camden Kaufman went the longest with four innings of work, striking out four and walking just three with three hits allowed. The loss overall for the Warriors marked their second loss of the 2020 campaign.
 On Wednesday, June 24, the Warriors came back home for a doubleheader battle with Johnston in two lopsided affairs. Waukee produced ten hits in the 12-3 game one win over the Dragons but delivered on just two hits in the 18-0 game two loss.
 Game one was quite the scoring frenzy as Waukee scored in all but two innings. The only deficit the Warriors faced in game one came in the top of the first when Johnston pushed one run across home plate. From there it was all Waukee as the Warriors put up four runs in the bottom half of the first for a 4-1 early lead. Thanks to a three-run second inning, a two-run third inning, and a two-run fourth inning, that small early lead blossomed into an 11-2 advantage entering the fifth inning. Both the Warriors and the Dragons added in one run each across the final three innings of play before Waukee ended things off with a 12-3 win. Jalen Martinez had a strong outing striking two hits in four trips to the plate, including his second home run of the season. Martinez drove in three runs in the contest and now leads the Warriors with 11 total runs driven in. Jackson Wentworth went five strong innings on the mound, striking out eight batters while walking two and allowing just one hit.
 Game two was quite a different story for the Warriors. In an almost mirrored version of game one, Waukee found themselves down early 4-0 following the first inning. That doubled to an 8-0 deficit following four innings of play. The big blow for Waukee came in the fifth inning where Johnston produced a season-high ten single inning runs, forcing Waukee to end the game early for the first time in several years. Offensively for the Warriors, Alex Walsh was the only batter to strike a hit wracking up two doubles. Waukee used four pitchers in the contest, with Jacob Barton issuing the most strikeouts with three while Matthew Jongerius and Colin Evers producing a pair of strikeouts each.
 Overall, the Warriors will enter their Friday contest with a mark of 7-3. Next up on the docket for Waukee will be a road matchup against Ankeny on Friday, May 26 with game one of the doubleheader beginning at 5 p.m.

With the SNP on course to win a majority of votes at the Holyrood election, using the vote as a proxy for declaring an independence referendum would cause a massive constitutional and legal crisis.
 Nicola Sturgeon has set herself against anything but a legal referendum and Boris Johnson has repeatedly said he will not grant a second vote while he is prime minister.
 But Cherry’s backing for the so-called “Plan B” to be debated at party conference bolsters the idea that has so far only been supported by independence outriders.
 SNP MP Angus MacNeil and councillor Chris McEleny have pushed for their version of “plan B” to simply declare independence on the outcome of an SNP majority at the Holyrood election.
 Earlier this week veteran SNP MP Pete Wishart warned that the “plan B” proposals would put Scotland in same “hellish limbo” as Catalonia where separatists held an illegal referendum leaving the constitutional question unresolved.

The only show in the town of Adel Thursday night was the battle between the ADM High School and Woodward-Granger High School baseball teams.
   
 For the ADM fans, the Tigers did not disappoint as five second-inning runs helped propel the team to a 10-1 victory over a Hawks squad that gave up just 2.8 runs per game entering the contest. ADM tied their season-high in hits with eleven total and six of those eleven came within the first two innings of action. Following two singles to kick off the offensive action for the Tigers, ADM touched up the scoreboard first as Tate Stine-Smith drove in the first of three runs for the game as part of a big night for the junior. When all was said and done. Stine-Smith led ADM with three runs driven in, increasing his team-leading RBI total to eight on the season. It marked the seventh first- inning run that the Tigers have produced this season and it quickly gave ADM a 1-0 advantage.
   
 ADM really had two breakout innings which included the second inning where they posted five of their ten runs. It also marked the most runs given up in a single inning by Woodward-Granger this season. Overall, four Tigers drove in two runs for the contest, and that included Grant Garton. The junior followed up his game-winning hit on Tuesday with two hits and two RBI to wrap up the week Thursday. His first at-bat for the contest in the second inning produced his first RBI on a single to right field which in turn increased the ADM lead to a 2-0 mark. Stine-Smith also joined in on the second inning scoring action with a single to right field, scoring fellow junior Ethan Juergens from second base. Kaden Sutton's third double of the season, an Juergens RBI, and a Woodward-Granger error rounded out the second inning action for ADM, giving the Tigers a six-run lead after two innings.
   
 The rest of ADM's five hits would be spread out across the final five innings of play. The theme of scoring in bunches this season for ADM continued on yet again in the fifth inning Thursday night. With three runs in the inning, it marked the sixth such inning this season where ADM scored three or more runs in a single inning. Against the Hawks, that began with Zach Fuller's fourth double of the season to plate one run. Garton's second RBI of the game came in the inning and coupled with a score on a passed ball, that rounded out the scoring efforts on the night for the Tigers.
   
 "This group is very capable of scoring in bunches," said Tiger head coach Jason Book earlier this season. "It's not out of the question because once this team gets going, they are hard to stop."
   
 On the mound, ADM deployed Chase Anderson as the starting pitcher and he didn't disappoint. The senior tossed nearly six innings of work and suffered just four walks and four hits allowed. His seven strikeouts Thursday night now gives Anderson a Raccoon River Conference second-best mark of 17 total strikeouts on the season. Anderson also showed that his approach to the strike zone is hard for hitters to master as five out of his seven strikeouts came on swings and misses.
   
 The win gives ADM their sixth straight victory overall and fourth victory against a team holding a record above .500. The Tigers end their first of what looks to be several unblemished weeks of action in 2020. The next event on the docket for the Tigers will be perhaps their toughest test yet in the Winterset Huskies on Monday, June 29. The Tigers will once again be back home for that battle as they seek their 14th win over the Huskies since the 2009 campaign. The battle will begin with the first pitch at 7:30 p.m.

Yes, you’ve guessed it right. The rotating base was the first thing that grabbed our attention. But what makes it even more impressive is the fact that it doesn’t become a baggage for the design. In fact, it maintains a very sleek profile of just about 0.1 inch to fall in line with the overall slimness.
