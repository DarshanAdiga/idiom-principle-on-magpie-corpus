VANCOUVER, Canada (AP) — Canada’s opposition Conservative Party is holding an entirely mail-in ballot election for a new leader to carry it into the next general election. Results are to be announced on Sunday.


  Just over 269,000 party members are eligible to vote in the race to replace Andrew Sheer, who resigned resigned in December after the party lost to Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau's Liberals.


  The frontrunners appeared to be Peter MacKay, 54, a Cabinet minister under former Prime Minister Stephen Harper, and Erin O’Toole, 47, a longtime member of Parliament and Royal Canadian Air Force veteran who finished third in the 2017 leadership race.


  Also in the race are Derek Sloan, 35, a rookie Ontario MP who made headlines for tweeting his belief that being gay is a choice, and Leslyn Lewis, 49, who immigrated to Canada from Jamaica as a child and is now a lawyer with a master’s degree in environmental studies.


  The four have similar platforms on issues like reducing the size of government, cutting taxes and taking a harder line on China’s involvement in the Canadian economy.


  “To me, there’s not a whole lot of daylight in this campaign on those core issues,” said Sanjay Jeram, a senior lecturer and chair of undergraduate studies in political science at Simon Fraser University in Vancouver.

The message was meant to influence the KHSAA board members to vote in favor of starting Kentucky high school fall sports back up.

Police are not trained on diagnosing any medical conditions, but most know first aid and CPR. Every police agency has different criteria for calling in paramedics, according to Jimmy Holderfield, secretary for the National Fraternal Order of Police.


  “The best rule of thumb to apply here is what a ‘prudent and reasonable’ person would do,” Holderfield said by email. “Officers are charged with the duty of protecting lives and property.”


  Emergency medical personnel administer ketamine when they believe it's necessary, police say. But there's growing concern over whether officers are too involved in the decision and conflicting medical opinions on using it during arrests.


  The American Society of Anesthesiologists opposes it and other sedatives for law enforcement purposes, saying, “These effects can end in death when administered in a non-health care setting without appropriately trained medical personnel and necessary equipment.”


  Those in favor of ketamine cite its fast-acting and short-lived effects as well as scientific reports that it doesn’t cause severe respiratory problems compared with other sedatives.


  For police, the objective is to help deescalate a tense situation and lessen restraints they need to use, Lindbeck said. Other options include drugs like Valium or Xanax and anti-psychotics.

CHARLOTTE, N.C. — Former Fox News star Bill O’Reilly was set to hold court for a night at Spirit Square. The jokesters at “The Daily Show” had booked the Knight Theater for a week of taping.

“In places the soil was shallow and great broken rocks and dense growths made progress difficult. Large patches of Guinea grass were noted extending almost to the summit. The view from the top is one of unsurpassed beauty and commands the whole island. The forest of the mountain was quite dense in places, while its north side was so precipitous that it seemed to be almost sheer to the ocean.”


  Today, Mount Eagle’s vegetation has changed drastically due to human impact for hundreds of years on the forest ecology. However, the forest still contains interesting plant species and wildlife, especially the rare Bridled Quail Dove (Geotrygon Mystacea) that almost went extinct in the mid-1800s.


  Today, there is a new threat to Mount Eagle. It was two months after hurricanes Irma and Maria impacted the Virgin Islands that I decided to hike the mountain. It was an early cool morning, with my backpack on my back and boots on my feet, as I hiked and took in the fresh air blowing from the northwest and east up Mount Eagle mountain’s northeast ridge.


  I can still hear the crickets making their chirping song and see the dew evaporating off the foliage of the trees and grasses with the sun about to burst through the eastern sky. As I looked down on the carpet-like forest floor, wet from the night dew, I saw droppings of some kind of animal on the path.


  I tried to figure out what wild animal it could be. It was the first time that I saw so much of the droppings, which covered a long distance along the path of the trail.


  At first, I thought it was deer droppings, but as the wind blew, I realized it came from goats. If you have ever been around goats, they have a distinctive and unusual smell. If your grandmother ever told you “boy go to bath” because you smell like a “ram goat,” you knew exactly what she was talking about.

Of course, male politicians have their own sartorial dilemmas. But viewing clothing as a form of self-expression has not, traditionally, been an explicit aspect of electoral politics, said Rhonda Garelick, a fashion historian.


  Now, she sees women engaging in, and succeeding at, what she calls “pink politics” — reclaiming what has long been considered trivial, or a liability.


  “As soon as we acknowledge the importance, it becomes a profoundly feminist act,” said Ms. Garelick, a professor and the dean of the School of Art and Design History and Theory at Parsons School of Design. “For decades, women being glamorous meant risking not being taken seriously. But quite brilliantly, we are seeing women who are now unafraid of the arsenal of glamour, making a statement with their style and using it for the politically powerful tool it has always been.”


  Fashion is a bipartisan political tool, and she sees women in both parties expanding their definition of how a politician should dress. Sometimes, change is very personal.

  Before she publicly spoke out about her diagnosis of alopecia in an emotional video revealing her bald head, Representative Ayanna Pressley, Democrat of Massachusetts, said that by wearing her hair in twists she “felt my most authentic and powerful self.”


  At the time, Ms. Pressley described her own style as “very conservative” and “traditional,” adding: “It’s only recently that I’ve been a little bit edgier in my dress.” Since then, Ms. Pressley’s leather jacket and colorful clothing have drawn their own fans.


  Ms. Moseley Braun recalled a conversation years ago with a civil-rights leader who said that some of America’s most persistent racism had as much to do with hair as skin color.


  “It’s a very sensitive issue for Black women,” said Ms. Moseley Braun, who has worn dozens of hair styles during her decades-long career as a politician and ambassador.


  In 2010, when Ms. Moseley Braun started her failed bid to become the mayor of Chicago, one campaign adviser told her she needed extensions so that she could wear her hair similar to the style that Mrs. Obama wore at the time.


  “She insisted that if I didn’t get those kinds of extensions then people would think I was out of touch, or that I was saying I was not worthy,” Ms. Moseley Braun said. “I fell for the okey doke, it cost a fortune, and I still lost the election.”


  And for all that has changed, it is easier not to break boundaries. London Breed, the mayor of San Francisco, said that she no longer wears jeans in public, even when she is not on business. And though she has considered wrapping her hair in a scarf, she most often has it straightened.


  “The safest thing to do is to go with the same suit,” she said. “People do make comments, and women get them more than anyone else. I remember there was a mayor with only three suits and nobody said anything about his clothes.”


  Ms. Breed has turned to one mentor over the years to ask about image — Ms. Harris.

  For her acceptance speech Wednesday, Ms. Harris wore a pantsuit, as she often does. But she is also known for her collection of Converse sneakers and got rave reviews for a rainbow sequin jacket she wore at San Francisco’s pride parade.


  “I grew up surrounded by people who took their appearance very seriously,” Ms. Harris said in a 2011 interview published in Harper’s Bazaar. “It was a sign of self-respect.” (She also noted the “fabulous” ruching on an otherwise conservative suit she wore.)


  When Ms. Haaland arrived in Washington, after winning office in 2018, she knew that many women cut their hair short or pull it back in a professional setting.


  “My long dark brown hair is part of my culture,” she said. “I have to honor my ancestors also. I wear big long dangly earrings, I wear a lot of bracelets. Sometimes they make a little bit of noise.”


  A decade ago, she may have felt pressure to leave her jewelry at home.


  “But now I just think we’re all these women, we all have each other’s back,” she said.

  On Tuesday night at the D.N.C., when the camera turned to Representative Veronica Escobar during the roll call vote, she spoke about the deadly 2019 attack in her El Paso district, wearing all white and large gold hoop earrings. As a candidate, Ms. Escobar campaigned in sneakers, with her hair in a ponytail. There was nothing about her that made her stick out in the district. But when her husband went to visit her in Washington after she became the first Latina congresswoman from Texas, he teased her by remarking “you’re easy to spot,” referring to the bright clothes she was wearing that day.


  “It’s not that I want to go against the grain, I just do my thing,” she said. Part of that thing is routinely walking through the National Capitol in towering heels. “I am always in tacones,” she said, using the word for stilettos in Spanish.


  In 2018, when she was 27, Lina Hidalgo ran for chief executive of Harris County, the most powerful office in Houston, and she heard conflicting views of how she should change her look. First, a longtime leader of a nonprofit group suggested during a meeting that she acquire a pearl necklace or two, so that she could look older and more serious. Then, at an event a few days later, two young activists pulled her aside to say that she needed to wear hoops to signal her progressive bona fides.


  Ms. Hidalgo politely thanked the well-meaning supporters. Then she ignored them.


  And yet, she had a nagging feeling that she was invisible at her own campaign events — that hardly anyone would recognize her as the candidate until someone else introduced her.


  “The most common ways I see women using clothing is either as an invisibility cloak or as armor,” said Katherine Johnson, an image consultant who volunteers her services to progressive female candidates, including Ms. Hidalgo, who won the election. “When you’re playing in what is still a man’s world, what I see women do over and over is try to project strength and power. But people also need warmth and connection.”

  What Ms. Hidalgo learned, she said, was “all the things that work for me and make me feel confident and strong,” which she showcased in her own convention appearances.


  “Every time one of us runs and wins, we’re updating the perception of power,” she said.


  These days, Ms. Hidalgo’s most striking fashion statements come in the form of her face masks — leopard print, elaborate embroidery, bright-green avocado — which she posts frequently on Instagram. In the past several months, she has received hundreds handmade by other women across the country.

According to the Italian journalist, Ciro Venerato, Napoli is considering a move for Shkodran Mustafi if they miss out on signing Gabriel to Arsenal.


  The Italians are battling Arsenal and Manchester United for the signature of Gabriel from Lille (SkySports).


  The Brazilian defender has emerged as a top target for the trio and he will most likely sign for one of them.


  The latest reports claim that Arsenal is leading the race to sign him after having their bid for his signature accepted by the French side.


  Napoli and Manchester United are looking to hijack the Gunners’ move for him and that is making him take more time to decide on his next home.


  Venerato spoke to a Napoli outlet recently and he claimed that Napoli will look to sign Mustafi should they eventually miss out on signing Gabriel.


  Sokratis is another defender that they are looking to sign with reports claiming that they have even held talks with the Greek defender before now (The Sun).


  Venerato told Radio Kiss Kiss Napoli: “If Gabriel fades? At that point Napoli will turn to a plan B, in addition to Sokratis, there is also talk of Mustafi, also coming out of Arsenal.

  The massacre occurred four days after the Allied D-Day landings in Normandy. The killings were believed to have been ordered in retaliation for the kidnapping of a German soldier by the French Resistance.

MOSCOW — University of Idaho President Scott Green said in an email to students Friday evening that those who don’t abide by the school’s coronavirus restrictions “should not be here, and we will take the necessary steps to remove you from our community.”
 Green’s email said the “vast majority” of students are complying with UI’s Healthy Vandal Pledge. But even in the initial days of students returning to Moscow in anticipation of the start of classes Aug. 31, the school has gotten reports of parties, both on and off campus, where social distancing and face coverings were ignored.
 The Dean of Students Office and the Moscow Police Department are following up on the reports of parties, Green wrote in his email. He said students found in violation of city ordinances and school policy could be suspended or expelled, and fraternities or sororities that violate rules could have first-year students removed from their houses or have their chapters closed.
 Green mentioned in his email that some colleges have closed their campuses after “superspreader infections from large gatherings,” and others have suspended students.
 “Frankly, if you are not willing to support our university and those who want an in-person instruction environment, you should not be here, and we will take the necessary steps to remove you from our community,” Green wrote.
 UI is planning on holding in-person classes in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, and is requiring all students to be tested before they can attended classes. According to the school’s website Friday, 2,371 tests have been received and there have been 34 positive tests.
 Those who violate coronavirus restrictions “put our entire community at risk” and “endanger the ability of your peers to get the live instruction they are working hard to secure,” Green wrote. He also asked students to observe the Healthy Vandal Pledge and help the school “identify and separate those who do not.”
 Green ended his email with this passage: “We have only one chance to get this right. Please keep that in mind this weekend and as you continue through the semester. Students, we have your back ... now it’s time to do your part.”
 Washington State, which won’t have in-person classes this semester, issued an alert Friday about “a substantial increase in COVID-19 cases in the Pullman area among ages 18-24.” The school’s alert urged people to comply with statewide orders calling for face coverings and that gatherings be limited to 10 people or less.

Nurse is 111-43 in two seasons. He has more than validated the Raptors' decision to fire Dwane Casey in 2018, even though Casey had been Coach of the Year that season after guiding Toronto to a 59-23 record.


  But the Raptors kept getting overrun by LeBron James and Cleveland in the playoffs. So team president Masai Ujiri decided to part ways with Casey, the franchise's career leader in victories, and promote Nurse, who had been an assistant for five years.


  Nurse has already nearly caught Casey for the Raptors' record for playoff wins by going 19-8 over the last two seasons. Casey was 21-30.


  Ujiri praised Nurse for being hardworking yet relaxed


  "Always setting the tone for our team — attacking our next championship, rather than defending our last,” Ujiri said. “That is who Nick is, that is why we believe in him. His journey to this tremendous honor has been a long one. We are so happy to see him recognized this way.”


  Nurse worked his way to the top through lower levels of basketball. The Northern Iowa graduate got his first head coaching job at Grand View College when he was 23, before becoming an assistant at South Dakota.


  He coached 11 years in Europe, winning nine championships in the British Basketball League, before leading Rio Grande Valley and Iowa to G League titles.

The vote, which came around noon on Thursday, brought joy and relief to thousands of Kentucky high school athletes, their parents and a large legion of fans. After being shutdown and denied the ability to compete in high school athletics (with the exception of golf) since March, almost everyone was excited about getting back to some sort of normalcy and playing high school sports again.


  However, Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear was not one of those excited sports fans. Approximately four hours after the KHSAA Board of Control's decision to start sports back up again, Beshear stated in a statewide televised COVID-19 update that he was 'surprised' by the board's decision to start 'high touch' sports (football, volleyball and soccer) so soon. And said, "I'm going to take some time to think it through. I think a student-athlete is a student first and an athlete second."


  And in less than 24 hours, the impact of Beshear's statements seemingly created a domino effect, and the euphoria of high school sports returning was quickly dampened. By Friday afternoon, two large prominent school districts announced they would meet Monday to discuss fall sports.


  By 1 p.m. on Friday, Jefferson County Public School Board announced a special called meeting on Monday, Aug. 24 - which is the official start date of fall sports practices. About that same time, Pulaski County High School football coach Johnny Hines received notice from Lexington Henry Clay (who the Maroons were scheduled to play in their football season opener on Sept. 11) that the Blue Devils would be cancelling their first two games of the season - leaving the local Maroons without a game for their football season opener.


  Not long after that, the Fayette County school board announced they would be discussing fall sports in their regularly planned school board meeting on Monday, and cancelled all sports practices for Monday and Tuesday. A little bit later it was confirmed that Lexington Tates Creek had cancelled their season opener football game.


  Time to dust off your social media "Let Us Play" and "Let Them Play" mimes.


  Within moments of the Governor's public statement and the two large school districts announcement of meetings regarding fall sports, the "Let Them Play" movement was back up and running. A Facebook group entitled, # Let Them Play, recruited nearly 8,000 followers in a matter of hours. Testimonies from athletes, parents, coaches and fans pleaded for their desire to play sports again.


  While some of the messages were of individuals telling what high school sports meant to them and to the people they loved, other messages were aimed more towards the Governor and protesting his potential interference of the KHSAA's decision to start fall sports on Sept. 7.


  I am not an expert in government, but why have a statewide represented non- political athletic association if you are are not going to abide by their decisions?


  How can one man in Frankfort have a better grasp of what is best for Kentucky high school athletes, than a statewide appointed group of 18 individuals who encompass every nook and cranny of the state?


  If the Governor knows more about sports than the KHSAA, then maybe he should run the state's sports organization. Maybe he should organize all the athletic state championships. Maybe he should oversee and conduct all the hearings on athletic eligibility cases. Maybe he should organize internal committees to ensure all Kentucky high athletic competitions have trained and licensed officials on hand. Maybe he should.....

_This editorial was published by the Everett (Wash.) Herald._
 ———
 It’s not water over the dam.
 In other words, don’t assume the word “final” in three federal agencies’ Final Environmental Impact Statement regarding salmon and steelhead preservation strategies on the Columbia and Snake rivers has ended the debate over the fate of four dams on the lower Snake River in eastern Washington.
 At the end of last month, three federal agencies — the Army Corps of Engineers, Bonneville Power Administration and the Bureau of Reclamation, which oversee management of the Northwest’s hydroelectric dams — released their final analysis and recommendations on how best to preserve threatened and endangered runs of salmon and steelhead on the rivers.
 For more than 20 years, environmentalists and regional tribes have advocated for river habitat enhancements, including the removal of the four Snake River dams built in the 1960s and 1970s between the Tri-Cities and the Washington- Idaho border. Removal of the dams is seen as the most effective way to save and rebuild declining runs of the fish on which tribal, sport and commercial fishing depend, as well as other endangered species, especially the state’s orca whales, which spend part of the year at the mouth of the Columbia feeding on salmon before returning to Salish Sea waters in northwest Washington.
 Currently, 13 runs of salmon are listed as endangered or threatened species; four of them return to the Snake River to end and begin their life cycle.
 But the dams’ removal has been opposed by many who warn that the loss of the dams would bring a decrease in available electricity and higher costs for the region’s ratepayers and difficulties for eastern Washington farmers who depend on the dams for irrigation and barge shipping.
 The federal agencies in the 5,000-page report recommend leaving the four dams in place and instead using increased spill of water at the dams during spring and early summer to aid the passage of juvenile fish on their way downriver to the Pacific Ocean. Increasing spill during times of low demand for electricity would reduce the number of fish killed in turbines and screens.
 The agencies’ report, however, admits that removal of the dams would provide endangered sockeye and threatened steelhead and spring and fall chinook the best chance at recovery, the Lewiston Tribune reported last week, and that the “flexible spill” plan’s effectiveness is limited, providing enough chance for fish survival to stop the decline of runs but not to rebuild fish numbers.
 That’s because the fish need more than the spill of water when it’s convenient for electricity production to thrive and rebuild their numbers, said Brett VandenHeuvel, executive director for Columbia Riverkeeper, which advocates for the river, speaking last week with the Herald editorial board.
 The dams slow and limit the number of salmon returning to spawning grounds above the dams, but the dams themselves also are a major source of water pollution that is killing salmon; not from a chemical contaminant but from water that’s too warm for fish survival.
 “It’s become so hot on the Snake, we think that dam removal is likely the only way to meet safe temperature levels for salmon,” VandenHeuvel said.
 That threat was recently affirmed in a report by the federal Environmental Protection Agency.
 The Snake River dams, called run-of-the-river dams because of their limited storage capacity, are shallower than other dams on the Columbia, allowing for temperatures to build during summer heat. Salmon can tolerate temperatures up to about 68 degrees; temperatures behind three of the four dams ranged from 71 to 73 degrees for the week ending Aug. 3, a range they had exceeded for at least two weeks this summer, according to the most recent “hot water report” by Save Our Salmon, a state organization advocating for salmon.
 In 2015, an estimated 250,000 adult sockeye salmon died from exposure to warm waters during a hot summer with reduced river flows, VandenHeuvel said. On other occasions adult salmon — fighting their evolutionary drive to spawn — have swum in circles or actually reversed course on the river, swimming downstream to cooler water when confronted by high temperatures, he said.
 Environmental groups, tribes and others don’t deny the potential impacts of the dams’ removal for hydroelectric production, irrigation and barge transportation, but they continue to encourage a discussion among residents, interest groups and officials about workable solutions for all.
 There are options, Sam Mace of Save Our Salmon told the editorial board, to replace lost power production with solar and wind generation; as well, continued investments in rail freight and irrigation could address the concerns of farmers, she said.
 The dams are not without their own costs, Mace and VandenHeuvel said. The dams’ components, including their turbines, are nearing the end of their service lives and will need replacement in coming years; likewise there are continuing costs to maintain the locks and dredge the river bottom to keep barge traffic moving.
 The final determination by the involved federal agencies shouldn’t mean an end to discussions about the potential benefits of removing the dams, said Jacqueline Koch of the National Wildlife Federation.
 Lawsuits that challenge the federal plan remain a possibility. For example, the U.S. Supreme Court has affirmed lower court rulings that will require the state of Washington to spend up to $3.7 billion to replace culverts under highways and roads that block salmon access.
 Ultimately, a decision on the dams’ removal could be left to Congress. Koch, Mace and VandenHeuvel expressed support for continuing discussions that move forward on infrastructure improvements that would be necessary should the dams be removed in the future.
 Those discussions, Koch said, don’t necessarily fall along the nation’s red- blue divide. While Washington’s three Republican House representatives have stated their support for keeping the dams, among those encouraging a discussion of what dam removal would look like is U.S. Rep. Mike Simpson, R-Idaho.
 Even as the federal plan recommends keeping the dams, Koch said, “we do actually see a bright spot, because it does recognize that we need to be thinking about this in a different way.”
 That time to think — and then act — however, is not unlimited, especially as changes in climate more frequently affect seasonal snowpack and river water temperatures.

HOLDEN, Maine (WABI) - A C-17 cargo plane flying out of Travis Air Force Base in California landed in Bangor earlier this summer with an unexpected passenger.“He apparently he caught a ride,” Kathryn Ravenscraft, Director of Development af the Bangor Humane Society, says. “They made a brief stop in Colorado Springs where they think they picked him up. Then when they landed in Bangor they discovered there was a half eaten muffin somewhere on board and a pile of poop.”The Humane Society spent three weeks trying to find the cat’s owner in either California or Colorado with no success.Nanci Hamlin and Justin Proulx, who both work at Bangor International Airport, offered to adopt.“Let himself right out of the kennel and this was his house from that point on,” Proulx says. “He had no fear and the other cats were like ‘what is this and what is it in our house for’.”Cargo joins fellow cats Oliver, Cameron, Ralph, and Stoops, who was also named based on where he was found. He's most comfortable around Akiko, a husky.“Cargo and her are best friends. They instantly hit it off,” says Hamlin.Proulx and Hamlin are still astonished how Cargo made his way to Maine.“You can’t just walk onto a military base and animals are frowned upon being on any sort of an airfield,” Proulx says. Cargo is brave and clever enough to board a military aircraft on his own but he’s still a little wary of strangers. He hid behind the laundry nearly the whole time WABI reporter Spencer Roberts was there. He was told Cargo gets into trouble, climbing and crawling into places he probably shouldn’t.“He’s all over the place,” Hamlin says.The pilot of the plane expressed an interest in adopting Cargo, but then he was deployed. Proulx and Hamlin say they’ll foster the cat until he returns and makes a decision.If they do keep him, they plan to add his name to a crossword-style display that includes the names of all their other pets.“It’s been fun watching him settle in with a family that clearly loves him,” Ravenscraft says.Both Justin and Nanci encourage anyone who can provide a safe and loving home to adopt.“It will definitely make your life better,” Proulx says.Copyright 2020 WABI via Gray Media Group, Inc.

By not taking early action, Weisner said MSU locked in its most profitable age group, freshmen, who will pay tuition for typically four years.


  Eastern Michigan University hasn’t shown any signs of following MSU’s lead but Naiomi Wilson, who’s in her last year of the combined athletic training program there, said she worries about the future of her education.


  Wilson said the nine people in her program are set to come in once a week to do in-person training necessary to begin careers. Because just nine people are in the program, she’s not too worried that her classmates will not practice social distancing and take other precautions, but she has concerns for when the campus population comes back for classes Aug. 31.


  “There needs to be a little more consideration for certain groups of students, like nursing students. You’re not learning nursing online,” Wilson said. “It’s just a little frustrating that I guess the responses are the same across the board when I don’t necessarily know that they should be.”


  MSU hasn’t yet announced its plans for grad students and students in its osteopathic medicine, law and nursing schools.


  Being a parent of a student can be frustrating, too, said Michelle Rick, a judge in central Michigan and a mother of three college students. They are students at Saginaw Valley State University, Central Michigan University and MSU, facing issues like medical board exams postponed and difficulty with learning online.


  “We worry not about what are the choices that our kids make, but you can’t necessarily control the decision making of other people,” Rick said. “You’re trusting that people are making the right choices.”


  To ensure that students make the right choices and keep gatherings under 25 people, Ann Arbor police announced they will partner with the University of Michigan to enforce social distancing guidelines on the campus.


  Waller-Bey, the U-M doctoral student, said that with a national conversation taking place about over-policing of minorities, that decision “does not seem to read the room well.”


  “The criminalization of behaviors that otherwise would be permissible under any other circumstance creates this strange police state that did not exist in this iteration, because the university has failed to make a decision that actually honors the lives of its students, its staff and the members and stakeholders in the university,” Waller-Bey said.


  And she wonders what will happen to the custodians and other non-academic employees.


  “Who is really going to clean up the mess and I mean that literally?” Waller- Bey asked. “What are the ramifications for having these people be exposed to all these young people from all over? These universities have articulated commitments to equity and inclusion of diversity. Perhaps they only mean that for students and staff and faculty, but there are so many other important members of our university communities.”

The Roos would go on to defeat the Connecticut Riptide in the finals 8-5.
 Christian Grant would lead the Roos offense with a three-hit, 4 RBI performance in the finals.
 Alix Perras, Seth Petrashune and Landon Giroux had multiple hits for the Roos, while Steven Bronson, Logan Cleary and Donnie Mitchell chipped in with a hit a piece.
 Steven Bronson was electric early on, but left the game after sustaining an injury on a line drive to the head.
 Donnie Mitchell picked up where Bronson left off and continued his dominate season going 3 1/3 innings, giving up two hits and striking out eight.
 The Roos took an 8-1 lead into the sixth inning. Due to some untimely errors, the Riptide closed the gap to 8-5, before Perras induced a ground ball out to finish the game.
 "Our coaches and families couldn't be more proud of this group of young men", said Roos Manager Zeke Perras. "They continued to all work hard individually during this pandemic, just hoping for the chance to play some type of baseball season, and their hard work shows on the field. They waited almost a full calendar year to be able to play in a tournament together, and brought an energy like I've never seen before. These kids are a true definition of a team, and it shows on and off the field."

New cases of COVID-19 in Australia’s Victoria state continued to decline Saturday with 182 new infections, along with 13 deaths. It was the second day in a row in which the number of new infections has fallen below 200. Only 24 of the latest cases are without a known source, a contrast to the start of August when hundreds could not be traced. Australia’s second largest city, Melbourne, and parts of rural Victoria were placed in full lockdown in early August. It's due to continue until Sept. 13. “Whilst tomorrow’s numbers will be for tomorrow, we are all pleased to see a ‘one’ in front of these additional case numbers, and to a certain extent, it is perhaps at that level a little quicker than I thought it might be,” Victoria Premier Daniel Andrews said. Meanwhile, an outbreak linked to a youth detention center in Queensland state has caused the state’s premier to reintroduce restrictions on public gatherings. The cluster connected to the Brisbane Youth Detention Center now stands at seven, including six confirmed on Saturday. The 127 inmates, some as young as 13, have been locked in their rooms since a 77-year-old female supervisor tested positive on Wednesday. The worker, who is now in a hospital, worked five shifts at the center while infectious. Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk told a news conference Saturday the cases are of concern because “people have been out and about in the community.”
