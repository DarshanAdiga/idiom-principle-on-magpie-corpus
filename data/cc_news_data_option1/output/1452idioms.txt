As creatives face restlessness and scheduling adjustments during the COVID-19 pandemic, Los Angeles-based artist Pink Siifu kept the release date of his new album, _Negro_ (styled in all caps), fixed to a time that’s dearest to him — his mother’s birthday. Its promotion goes hand-in-hand with the diaristic format of the album’s website, through which he introduces a melting pot of visuals, links to samples on _Negro_ from intimate voice memos by family members, a clip from 1969 crime film _A Spook Who Sat by the Door_ , and never-before-seen photos of his family. The collage-like nature of the album may also tie into Siifu’s upbringing. Born Livingston Matthews in Birmingham, Alabama — home of Black revolutionaries Sun Ra, Angela Davis, and Eddie Kendricks, who inspired many of the political themes behind his work — Siifu has lived in a multitude of environments, from Cincinnati to New York, but has called East Los Angeles home for the greater part of the last decade.

 “In one second you go from crushing it,” Acia said, “to having all the rugs pulled from underneath you.”
 It’s too soon to assess the effect on the industry, but ClassPass, an app that allows users to book classes at more than 30,000 gyms and studios in 30 countries, lost 96% of its revenue in two weeks. Among the two dozen fitness and yoga instructors and gym and studio owners interviewed for this article, only three were well positioned to deal with an extended loss of income. (ClassPass is offering video classes on its app, too, by the way.)
 “It’s definitely scary times,” Forrester said. He has a wedding to pay for this summer, if that’s not canceled, too.
