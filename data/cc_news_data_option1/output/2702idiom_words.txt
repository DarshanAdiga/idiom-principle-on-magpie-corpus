In reply, the Men in Blue got off to a disastrous start as the Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma and KL Rahul got dismissed after scoring one run each. India’s defeat looked inevitable as they were reeling at 92/6 and the trio of Trent Boult, Lockie Ferguson and Matt Henry was breathing fire with the ball.

The game was scheduled to be played on July 9 and it also went underway. However, rain interrupted the game halfway through the match and the rest of the contest was played on the reserve day. Batting first, the Kiwis scored 239/8 courtesy half-centuries from skipper Kane Williamson (67) and Ross Taylor (74).
