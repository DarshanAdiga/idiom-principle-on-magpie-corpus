I will not belabor Swanson’s insightful points, other than to agree that POTUS is plainly creating a setting for potential coup should he proclaim his loss by any margin to be the result of a rigged election. Make no mistake. All indicators are that the forces of Secret Service and Homeland Security are loyal to POTUS first and only secondarily (maybe) to the Constitution such personnel took an oath to defend. I am not a chicken little here when I simply point out the obvious.
 I have voted both Democrat and Republican, and the POTUS is neither, nor has he religion, scruples or honesty. This stage has been and continues to be set as we, the American people, continue to sleep soundly believing in the strength of our Democratic Republic. Time will tell the story.

_Pristina, 03 ago 09:22 - (Agenzia Nova)_ \- Il primo ministro del Kosovo Avdullah Hoti è risultato positivo al coronavirus. Lo stesso premier ha confermato le indiscrezioni diffuse ieri dai media locali scrivendo di essere risultato positivo al Covid-19 in un post su Facebook. Hoti ha aggiunto di essersi messo in autoisolamento e ha dichiarato che espleterà le sue funzioni da casa per almeno due settimane. La parlamentare kosovara Mimoza Kusari-Lila ha intanto criticato Hoti, evidenziando che il premier avrebbe continuato a tenere alcuni incontri anche dopo essere risultato positivo al coronavirus. "Ha violato i protocolli sanitari esponendo decine di persone al rischio di infezione", ha osservato la parlamentare. Sono circa 250 i nuovi casi giornalieri medi in Kosovo negli ultimi giorni.

The worldwide effects of ongoing coronavirus epidemic accelerated the erosion of international norms and multilateral institutions already on course by 2019 (Brexit’s fulfillment, UNASUR’s nadir, the crumbling of the WTO under pressure of the US-China trade war escalation).

The sudden drive to self-reliance runs contrary to the pervasive effects of interdependence. The coordinated assistance from different sources, handled by proper leadership, informed by reliable data and sustained expertise seems a high tally for the time being, but long-standing inequalities showing up on peoples’ lives can no longer stand apart from international dynamics. With each corner of the globe looking to different diseases of the past searching for lessons, there is a lack of international initiatives for turning vaccines into global public goods or devising incentive systems to muster producers. The creation of cluster quarantine areas around big population centers is an early sign of the scale of new social relations.

A world of containment breeds autocratic impulses – _coronationalism_. International responses fall into a tailspin. National answers to global problems are, on average, suboptimal ones. The aggregate of national answers promotes further imbalances in the asymmetric anarchy. Short-run responses prevail over long-term concerted action. Beggar-thy-neighbor policies during epidemics may backfire. _Ad hoc_ actions fuel nationalism as well as global insecurity. People become more skeptical of their governments since they can no longer contribute to the safest possible international environment.

On March 30, 2001, US President George W. Bush announced the United States was leaving the Kyoto Protocol on global warming. Eventually, this move signalized the regime’s end. On July 7, 2020, President Donald Trump notified the United Nations that the US was leaving the World Health Organization during the COVID-19 epidemic (by then, with more than 10 million infections worldwide, 3 million-plus in the US). The move could further weaken an organization under fire since the announcement of an international health emergency earlier that year on January 30. Within days, the WHO launched an independent investigation on its handling of the epidemic, after admitting delays in releasing critical data and reviewing the possibility of airborne contagion. Across the two decades that set apart Kyoto’s demise from a new disease from Wuhan, international relations experienced a steady institutional retreat. The zeitgeist of a new century shows a reversal of the late-1990s hopes spurred by the end of the Cold War and Berlin Wall’s fall. In this sense, COVID-19 was no game-changer. It built upon already established trends.

In the five months the theatre was open, it has had a strong and favorable impact on the community.

Overlapping crises – environmental, economic, epidemic – render international institutions altogether more fragile and contested, less prone to binding decisions than governments on the ropes. That applies to WHO, the WTO, and the UN’s Security Council. Deep silences, broken by nationalistic lingo, autarchic efforts, don’t comprise any return to normality. COVID-19 severed multiple channels that linked societies until 2019. It became the high-priority issue in different societies and on a global scale. Military power seems inadequate for it. With 2 out of 3 conditions of “complex interdependence” absent, we deal with a different “globalization”.

As a result of the pandemic’s impact, policymakers, residents, staff, and others have raised questions about whether there has been sufficient federal and state oversight of and guidance for nursing homes, and CMS has released a series of guidance and other policy actions. The Social Security Act authorizes the Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary to establish requirements relating to nursing home residents’ health, safety and well-being as conditions for facilities to receive payment from the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Nursing homes can be certified as Medicare skilled nursing facilities (SNFs)1 and/or Medicaid nursing facilities (NFs).2 Medicare is the primary payer for about 12 percent of nursing home residents, with coverage limited to short-term stays for skilled nursing care or rehabilitation. Medicaid is the primary payer for 62 percent of nursing home residents, covering both short-term skilled nursing care and rehabilitation, as well as long-term care. This brief answers key questions about nursing home oversight and explains how federal policy has changed in light of COVID-19.

The storm will transition to a tropical rainstorm as it moves into eastern Canada by midweek. A few areas of showers and thunderstorms are forecast to extend over the Midwest and Southeast states. Most of this rain will not be associated with Isaias. An extensive pocket of cool air is forecast to cover the Midwest and Plains as a few storms erupt on the western edge of the cool air over the northern High Plains. Much of the area from the Rockies to the Pacific coast will be dry and sunny. Ongoing dry conditions will keep the risk of fires elevated. SPECIAL WEATHER No new information for this time period.

Mryon Roderick needed just one year to find his footing as the head coach of his alma mater, but by 1958, he had put the team pack on top. Dick Beattie, a fellow Olympian with Roderick in 1956, won a title, as did Duane Murty, and six additional Cowboys finished on the podium. The 1958 title would be the first official title for Oklahoma State, and while the team name may have been new, the success was anything but. Roderick knew how to win after spending his career under the coaching leadership of Art Griffith, and his 1958 win made him the youngest head coach to ever win a title at the age of 23. There was new energy in the Cowboy wrestling room, and that energy wasn't leaving.

Those protests were spontaneous and grassroots-based. In Barking, in my constituency, a group of young people organised a vigil via social media that overnight brought out a couple of hundred of people. The protests have brought onto the streets, despite the risks of doing so, people from all sections of our society, many who aren’t protest “regulars”, and especially many young people. Years of frustration at the impact of institutionalised racism – despite numerous inquiries into racism in everything from policing to prisons to education and employment – has found a profound resonance in the Black Lives Matter message.

Quarantines, lockdowns elongate uncertainties. In a world of containment, rising anxieties and control of space turn into readiness for action. States may benefit from multilateral delays of their own making in the short run, shunning international bodies at too high a cost. Then, global delays in responding to epidemics get in the way of angry confined populations. Against this backdrop, we get closer to Zygmunt Bauman’s imperative of coexistence[11]. Accepting one another regardless of differing circumstances, we may be able to coexist in conflict-prone, contingent cooperation. An emergency brings opportunity for joint leaps ahead.

The wild momentum of 2005 carried into 2006, but the season wasn't quite as seamless. Like 2004, the Cowboys suffered two season losses, this time to Minnesota in both the beginning and end of the year. Four conference champions elevated Oklahoma State back to the top of the standings in the Big 12 championship, and two national champs kept the Cowboys on top at the NCAA tournament later that season. Both champs, Johny Hendricks and Jake Rosholt, defended titles, with Hendricks winning his second crown and Rosholt taking home gold for the third time. Rosholt is considered one of the best 197-pound wrestlers in NCAA history because of the success that he had wrestling for the Cowboys from 2003-2006. His performances and the quality of the team's wrestling during that period gave Oklahoma State its most recent titles, and Smith has yet to lead another team to the top.
