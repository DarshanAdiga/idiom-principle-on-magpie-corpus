Westwood One and CBS Sports Network college basketball analyst Donny Marshall knows a thing or two about the drive to make the tournament, having helped lead the UConn Huskies to three appearances in the late 90s. He says that while Hofstra's players may downplay the importance of the game on the outside, treating it like any other, there is no doubt that the team's senior leaders are stressing the importance of avoiding last year's fate.

GOSHEN - Orange County, in partnership with the Orange County ThinkDIFFERENTLY Committee and the CFOS - Friends of Older Adults fund, hosted a free movie event featuring the film "The Peanut Butter Falcon" on Feb. 25 at the Paramount Theatre in Middletown.
   
 The movie screening was the first event of 2020, celebrating the launch of Orange County's "ThinkDIFFERENTLY" initiative, modeled after the program in neighboring Dutchess County.
   
 "We had a great turnout and our guests really enjoyed themselves," Orange County Executive Steven M. Neuhaus said. "I fully support events such as this that are inclusive of all individuals regardless of the challenges they might face. We must take the time to consider how we all relate to our neighbors of every ability. I look forward to hosting more events like today's movie event here in Orange County."
   
 "ThinkDIFFERENTLY" was started by Dutchess County Executive Marc Molinaro in early 2015. It serves as a call to action for local residents, organizations and businesses to re-think the ways they relate to residents with special needs. "ThinkDIFFERENTLY" encourages all counties and municipalities to promote supportive environments for residents of all abilities.
   
 Through its Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Program, Orange County has supported accessibility initiatives by funding ADA projects at Tommie McDuffie Park in Blooming Grove, the Village Park in Cornwall, Brook Lake Park in Town of Highlands, Benedict Park in the Town of Montgomery, the Winslow Therapeutic Riding Center in the Town of Warwick, and Sally's Dream Playground, located at Thomas Bull Memorial Park in Hamptonburgh.
   
 The "ThinkDIFFERENTLY" committee has worked to expand upon these initiatives and create new ones throughout the County. An Orange County ThinkDIFFERENTLY website and Facebook page are in the works and anticipated to launch in the near future.

The storm came up fast. The bad ones usually do. A strong wind took out one of my trees and slammed it onto my fence. On its way down, it took out branches from nearby trees. Leaves and twigs filled the perimeter of the fall. A few pots got shattered. Some hydrangea got squished. I had a mess on my hands.


  At first I was stunned and didn’t know what to do. I did a lot of talking about the fall but wasn’t doing much to fix the problem. I needed a plan.


  Cleaning up the aftermath of the storm seemed a lot like my life.


  The storm came out of nowhere. I went from listening to wind chimes on my back porch to hearing a loud crashing boom within the span of an hour. After the storm passed, I didn’t want to look outside to see how bad things were. Denial is always stage one.


  One step outside confirmed what I already knew. I had a big mess on my hands. I started picking up the small branches and the twigs and the leaves a few at a time. A big crash does a lot of damage. At first, I tried to move the tree myself, but it was too heavy. I needed help. I sought out a professional. Trees off fences, burdens off our hearts – sometimes the job is too big to do alone.


  The tree got hauled away pretty quickly and it was time to repair the fence. Even though I had everything in place (materials and skilled labor), there were lots of delays – the weather, busy schedules, sick children. I didn’t think I would ever get that fence repaired. But one day I did. I came home and the hole in my fence was gone. My fence was repaired. The fence looked different in that spot – new wood/old wood – but the fence was fixed. For a while I kept going outside to look at the repaired fence. Did the repairman do a good job? Was it good and strong? Eventually, I stopped checking. I closed that chapter. I moved on.


  This particular storm and tree incident happened a good while back. You have to look closely now to tell the difference between the old and the new wood. Time has a way of smoothing things out.


  Storms will come – usually out of nowhere. Big trees fall, taking down everything in their path. Dead wood has to be hauled away, and the area has to be cleaned up. Busted fences and broken hearts have to mend. Sometimes we can do it alone. Sometimes we need some help. It always seems to take longer than we think it should, but eventually fences and hearts are repaired and life goes on. No need to keep going back to the scene of the crash. No need to ask, “Why this tree?” or “Why me?” It happened. It’s been fixed. Move on.


  My fence is strong and sturdy and now, finally, so am I.

Interesting thread here with Bernie bro "Brent" reacting to loss of Texas. I see it as a contemporary millennial version of depressed Clean Gene supporter, Nov. 1972. Where he says _The views of our elders are very out ot touch with ours._ I'd just like to say: okay, you think older people don't get the urgency of it, bankruptcy from student debt and global warming et. al. looming, but maybe just try imagining being forced to get on a plane tomorrow and have to start shooting at Vietnamese with high chances of coming home in a body bag. And then living through it and seeing that Nixon really did end the war and the draft really did end. We get it Brent. We just think you haven't learned yet what doesn't work to fix it; been there, done that. Sorry it sounds like clueless old folks to you.

How different things had looked back in the summer, when Warren and five other women — a record number — appeared on the primary debate stage over two nights in late June, demonstrating the depth and diversity of the female field. Warren and California Sen. Kamala Harris earned top reviews for their debate skills.
 At the time, Debbie Walsh, director of the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University, had ventured to hope the female candidates could shake up the age-old electability question left hanging by Hillary Clinton’s stinging loss to Trump in 2016: Is the country ready to elect a woman president?
 But this week, Walsh was left to muse on how early Democratic primary voters were acting out of fear and caution and were buying “a false narrative out there that women candidates are too risky.”
 “This was the year that the Democrats were hell-bent on winning,” Walsh said. “A woman was defeated in 2016. There was all this talk after that, trying to explain, ‘How did Donald Trump happen?’ And this caution and fear has largely motivated us to the place we are right now.”
 All this, Walsh said, despite the great political success by female candidates in 2018, in Congress and in statewide races, showing that “as we have always said, when women run they win at about the same rate as men do in comparable races. We saw it across the board in 2018 and frankly in 2016, when more people voted for Clinton than Trump.”
 But the women in the race this time could not compete. Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar peaked with a third-place finish in New Hampshire but fell fast after failing to build the sort of racially diverse coalition needed to win a Democratic primary. Warren’s third-place showing in Iowa was her best, despite building a large national operation and surging last summer to the top tier. Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard remains in the race but has picked up only two delegates, hundreds behind the two men leading the race, former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.
 Warren in particular came to embrace her role as the choice for voters, particularly female voters, who thought it time for a woman to be president. But there was little evidence that female voters were prioritizing gender this time around; Biden pulled ahead with female voters in most states Tuesday — including in Massachusetts, Warren’s home state.
 As they carpooled over to a Klobuchar event earlier this week in Denver, next to the football stadium where the Broncos play, Linda Dee and Linda Rosales wondered when their candidate might leave the race.


--DocBreak--
By the time they arrived at Monday’s rally, Klobuchar had dropped out.
 “It looks like we’re coming down to two old white guys,” said Rosales, a 64-year-old retired lab worker. “I’m disappointed.”
 She and Dee left with a free green Amy 2020 T-shirt.
 To be sure, many voters say progress still has been made, even though a woman won’t be at the top of the ticket. And there is a broad expectation that both Sanders and Biden will feel pressure to name a woman as their running mate.
 Still, the frustration among some voters was palpable. A younger Warren supporter, LaShyra Nolen, the first black woman to be elected student council president at Harvard Medical School, said it’s not enough to have women on the ballot. Voters then need to step up and support them, she said.
 “I still do believe we are living in a society that is ridden by patriarchal control and inequality,” said Nolen, 24, of Los Angeles.
 For some, the dimming of women’s political fortunes felt like a marker of a fading movement. The #MeToo movement may have toppled powerful figures across industries, but some of the momentum behind gender equality is tapering off, believes Kaitlin Cornuelle, a 29-year-old director and writer in Los Angeles.
 That may have an impact on how engaged women — voters critical to Democrats’ calculus in November — will be next fall, she said.

"I just want to thank SoaR for doing what they needed to do," he said in his apology video.
 At the end of the day, this is just his first ban from Twitch, so it would appear likely that he'd be able to return in just a matter of days. However, in a follow-up stream on YouTube, Carl said the ban was "indefinite."
 He'll be on thin ice going forward if they do allow him back since Twitch doesn't particularly like it when streamers put themselves in danger like he did in the viral clip.

Detroit scored five runs in the first off Jeffrey Springs on C.J. Cron's three-run homer and Frank Schwindel's two-run drive. Schwindel added another two-run homer against Heath Hembree, and Niko Goodrum hit a solo shot. Iván Nova gave up five runs and seven hits in three innings, including J.D. Martinez's three-run homer in the first. Jackie Bradley Jr. went 3 for 3 with a solo home run and a double, raising his average to .412 in 17 at-bats. Top prospect Jeter Downs had two hits and an RBI.

INJURED Gold Coast Suns midfielder Emma Pittman says she never considered life after football until starting her second stint in rehab.


  But the Mackay product has seen the silver lining during her time on the sidelines and the fire to return to the field as a better player and leader burns brighter than ever.


  Pittman originally injured her AsCL in early 2019 and was nearing the end of her recovery period when she reaggravated the injury at training in January.


  The setback has kept Pittman off the field during the Suns’ debut AFLW season, but the 27 year old has found a different way to stay involved at the club.


  “(Getting back) on field would be the priority number one, but the fact the Suns have accommodated me by getting my nose in as an assistant midfield coach has been fantastic,” Pittman said.


  Pittman has shadowed midfield coach Andrew Swallow this season and acted as “the messenger” between the coaching staff and playing group.


  “Before this injury I’d never really had any injuries prior and that goes back to my soccer days,” she said.


  “ I’d never really thought about life after playing … but being on this side of the fence, I’m definitely starting to look into it more and it being an option for me after my playing days are over.


  “I’m definitely being converted more each day.”


  Pittman said the timing of her reinjury actually helped in her mental approach to recovery, because there was no pressure to get back in time to play.


  “If I was running out for my first game and I did it then I would have been in a worse place I think, but because I wasn’t back 100 per cent … I handled it pretty well, I would like to think,” she said.


  As a member of both the playing group and coaching staff, Pittman is in a unique position to take stock of the Suns’ start to AFLW life.


  “I’m just really proud of the girls, how they’ve pulled themselves together,” she said.


  “Sixteen new faces to AFLW and they haven’t missed a beat in their preparation.


  “It’s unfortunate we haven’t gotten ourselves over the line in the last couple of games but hopefully we can get a win under the belt (tonight).”

Knight is averaging a double-double on the season, 20.6 points and 10.5 rebounds per game while swatting 1.5 shots and knocking down a three per game. Combined with fellow senior Andy Van Vliet (7'0″ 231 pounds listed), the Tribe can make life miserable for opponents on the interior. It will be a fascinating matchup to watch in the neutral site, winner-take-all format of the conference tournament. Can Hofstra erase the memories of last season's defeat? Will William and Mary's twin towers be too much to handle inside? Will the Huskies shooting put them over the top? Or, does Towson's depth outlast its opponents.

I think a lot of Dem voters want more than safe and boring, what they are after is someone who doesn't attack like an Avenatti attacks. You admire that quality and think it's necessary but I think the majority of Dem women above milllennial age do not (and apparently suburban GOP women) and it's what they hate about Trump, much more than his stupidity and self-interest dealing. If it's not smart politics, so be it, they don't care, that's what they want: decency and kindness. My mother, a bleeding heart liberal empath, would have said _but why do they have to be so mean?_ A person like Avenatti would literally frighten her, she'd never trust him in a million years.

You have a point that reform doesn't have to start at the top. But party leaders at least need to be willing to fertilize grassroots innovators instead crushing them. Republicans held their fire-breathing rebels at arms length, but they were happy to let them run amok on the conservative airways and gin up votes. Democrats just want their own rebels--think AOC--to shut up and sit down.
