The company still expects “fresh highs” in the coming year after reporting a record net income of 1.29 billion ringgit (US$312 million) in its fiscal fourth quarter.

Research shows that, due to the current heightened threat from China, the public is unwilling to strongly criticize the military so as not to affect morale — and they are even worried that to do so would expose Taiwan’s weakness to the enemy.

Furthermore, by making the median line exist in name only, the PLA would be able to gradually encroach further toward Taiwan’s coastline and, in doing so, squeeze Taiwan’s 12 nautical mile (22.2km) territorial waters and airspace like a boa constrictor. This is Beijing’s _modus operandi_ in its psychological warfare campaign against Taiwan.

As a Chinese saying goes: “When a ruler’s personal conduct is correct, his government is effective without giving orders. If his personal conduct is not correct, he might issue orders, but they will not be followed.”

However, from a strictly professional perspective, since its inception, the general direction of the military’s war preparations, its thinking on command structures and troop utilization, its logistics and replenishment capabilities, and its overall preparedness for war do not provide much cause for optimism.

If the military could reorganize to bring itself to a heightened state of readiness, it would be able to make the most of its air defense capabilities and achieve a more effective outcome against China.

China threw down the gauntlet of a “military unification” of Taiwan decades earlier and holds annual, large-scale military exercises in the Taiwan Strait. Beijing deliberately concocts and then “leaks” details relating to the exercises, which are used to manipulate the political narrative on Taiwan and re-enforce China’s political stance on the nation.

High-ranking generals must show strict self-discipline and set a good example for the lower ranks. Generals are vying for power and profit while middle-ranking officers are exhausted and the lower ranks are left to clean up the mess. This damaging and unedifying state of affairs must not be allowed to continue.

Top Glove is talking to bankers on how best to list in Hong Kong and the process will take six to nine months, executive chairman Lim Wee Chai (林偉財) told reporters in a briefing last month.

The proposed Hong Kong listing, if it proceeds, “will enable Top Glove to be present in a larger, more active and liquid stock exchange,” the company said in the statement.

China has adopted a new military strategy for Taiwan: Each time the US military squeezes the PLA in some way, China simply transfers that pressure onto the Taiwan Strait by ignoring Taiwan’s air defense identification zone and the median line, normalizing the transformation of the Strait into a PLA training ground.

As the tempestuous situation in the Taiwan Strait becomes increasingly dire, there are reports that the nation’s high-ranking generals are competing for power.

China has upended the “status quo” in the skies above Taiwan, which are no longer stable or safe.

It must build asymmetric warfare capabilities, strengthen its guided-missile defenses, and, while working within the constraints of the national defense budget, reconstitute its air and naval armed strength, strive for military superiority in the Taiwan Strait and augment its defense capabilities to achieve an effective deterrence by increasing the cost for China of attacking Taiwan.

Beijing also uses domestic and international media to send signals threatening of military unification and increased hostility. Taiwanese must be cautious in the way they respond to such manipulated reports.

The listing would also diversify Top Glove’s investor base and provide a larger fundraising platform to support its growth, it said.

However, shielded by the protective umbrella of public goodwill, the military’s reforms, already carrying on at a snail’s pace, have even begun to go into reverse. The pursuit of personal interest is a serious problem and “administration according to the law” in the military is often little more than empty talk.     


--DocBreak--
Faced with China’s threats, the military has too many areas in need of reform. It must quickly get the ball rolling or face being unable to deploy its assets in time to meet the enemy’s increasingly brazen maneuvers.

If this happens, having ceded ground, the military would be left with only hollow words to mollify a dismayed public and would have handed the enemy carte blanche to gradually deepen its encroachment into Taiwan’s airspace.

If the military carries on in this way, it will find it impossible to keep pace with the increasingly stringent structural demands required to defend Taiwan proper and Penghu.

To respond to the threat, the air force must rapidly increase its overall fighting strength and re-examine its tactical deployments.

A significant number of European and US military experts agree that the Taiwan Strait is the No. 1 hot spot for a military conflict. For this reason, Taiwan must show the world that it possesses the will to resist China and ability to defend itself against an attack.
