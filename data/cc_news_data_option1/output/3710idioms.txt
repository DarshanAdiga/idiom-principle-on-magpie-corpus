"The private cloud ecosystem continues to mature in light of rapid digital transformations, making the competition to land one of the coveted spots on the Cloud 100 list steeper than ever," said Byron Deeter, a top cloud investor, and partner at Bessemer Venture Partners. "Private cloud valuations are getting bigger as the market's appetite for cloud continues to grow. Over the past five years, the average Cloud 100 valuation has grown by a tremendous 2.5x, from $1 billion in 2016 to $2.7 billion in 2020. In fact, our 2020 Cloud 100 includes over 87 private cloud unicorns! These founders represent the absolute best in cloud computing today, and they will most certainly follow in the footsteps of our esteemed Cloud 100 alumni. More than a third of the companies of the Cloud 100 have exited either via strategic M&A, financial M&A or Initial Public Offering. Congratulations to these cloud leaders!"

(The Quint is republishing this article from its archives on 'Hyderabad Liberation Day'. It was originally published on 17 September 2015.)The BJP has been pushing hard to celebrate Hyderabad Liberation Day on September 17 every year to mark the end of the Nizam’s rule in the erstwhile princely state.This chapter of history does not feature prominently in our textbooks. And neither does the brutal violence that was involved – a fact that was conveniently brushed under the carpet till recently.Supressing the History of a MassacreThe Sunder Lal Committee Report, submitted in 1949 and suppressed by subsequent governments, revealed that 27-40,000 people were killed in the aftermath of the annexation of Hyderabad.We can say at a very conservative estimate that in the whole state at least 27 thousand to 40 thousand people lost their lives during and after the police action. We were informed by the authorities that those eight were the most affected districts and needed most the good offices of our delegation. We, therefore, concentrated on these and succeeded, we might say, to some extent at least, in dispelling the atmosphere of mutual hostility and distrust.— The Sundar Lal Committee ReportThe Annexation of HyderabadIn September 1948, the Indian Army marched into the then-princely state of Hyderabad. The objective – Operation Polo.The erstwhile princely states of India had maintained subsidiary alliances with the British through which they enjoyed self-rule within their territories. In the Indian Independence Act of 1947, the British suspended all such alliances, leaving the Indian states with the choice of opting for full independence. But by 1948, almost all of these states had acceded to either India or Pakistan with the exception of one – Hyderabad.The Nizam of Hyderabad, Osman Ali Khan, Asaf Jah VII decided to choose independence and sought to maintain his self-rule through the Razakars, a militia recruited from the Muslim aristocracy.The newly-formed Indian government under Jawaharlal Nehru was decidedly eager to integrate the state into the new Indian Union.Citing that the Razakars were propagating unmitigated violence against the large Hindu population in the State of Hyderabad, Sardar Patel ordered the annexation of the princely state in September 1948. In five days of what was somewhat misleadingly termed as ‘police action’, the Indian army overtook the state by defeating the Razakars. Hyderabad became a part of the republic of India.Soon after, reports of massive violence emerged from the state, pointing fingers at the Indian troops for mercilessly killing and pillaging the Muslim population. An alarmed Nehru appointed a mixed-faith committee under Pandit Sundar Lal, Qazi Abdul Ghaffar, and Maulana Abdulla Misri to investigate and submit a report on the matter.The report never saw the light of day until 2013, when it was declassified after Historian Sunil Purushotham from the University of Cambridge filed a petition to obtain a copy.“Rape, Abduction of Women, Loot, Arson Accompanied the Killings”The Detailed Report of Pandit Sundar Lal, Qazi Abdul Ghaffar, and Maulana Abdulla Misri on the Aftermath of the Police Action (Military Invasion) by the Indian Army of the Hyderabad State in September, 1948 revealed that Indian troops indulged in looting, pillaging, rape, and murder of innumerable Muslims throughout the State of Hyderabad, that included parts of Karnataka, Maharashtra, and Madhya Pradesh.Almost everywhere in the effected (sic) areas communal frenzy did not exhaust itself in murder, alone in which at some places even women and children were not spared. Rape, abduction of women (sometimes out of the state to Indian towns such as Sholapur and Nagpur) loot, arson, desecretion (sic) of mosques, forcible conversions, seizure of houses and lands, followed or accompanied the killing.— The Sundar Lal Committee Report“Soldiers Encouraged, Persuaded, and Compelled Hindu Mobs to Loot Muslim Shops and Houses”The report also notes that not only did the Indian army indulge in various brutalities, but it also incited people to perpetrate violence.Duty also compels us to add that we had absolutely unimpeachable evidence to the effect that there were instances in which men belonging to the Indian Army and also to the local police took part in looting and even other crimes. During our tour we gathered, at not a few places, that soldiers encouraged, persuaded and in a few cases even compelled the Hindu mob to loot Muslim shops and houses. At one district town the present Hindu head of the administration told us that there was a general loot of Muslim shops by the military. In another district a Munsif house, among others was looted by soldiers and a Tahsildar’s wife molested.— The Sundar Lal Committee ReportWhither Liberation?For 65 years the Sunder Lal Committee Report was kept under covers. Why? Is it because the loss of a massive number of human lives it documents, were all in the name of liberation?Can we term this as liberation? Does liberation necessarily come at the cost of human lives and dignity?Does celebrating a Hyderabad Liberation Day not undermine the history of a despicable human tragedy? Liked this story?

DURANT - Southeastern Oklahoma State University reports that it experienced record-setting enrollment this fall despite the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.
   
 The university enrolled 5,339 students for the fall 2020 semester, marking the largest enrollment in its 111-year history.
   
 The number represents a 10.7 percent increase over the fall 2019 enrollment number of 4,824 students.
   
 Student credit hours are also up 6.7 percent over last fall.
   
 Enrollment at Southeastern increased 2.6 percent among undergraduate students and 25.8 percent for graduate students.
   
 "This continued enrollment growth is a direct result of the efforts of our faculty and staff,'' Southeastern president Thomas Newsom said. "They deserve a lot of credit, not only for ensuring a smooth transition to virtual learning last March, but for planning and preparing for a return to face-to-face instruction this fall."
   
 The graduate-level master of education and business administration programs, as well as the master of science in sports administration and Native American Leadership programs experienced significant growth, as did undergraduate occupational safety and health programs.
   
 Newsom also credits Southeastern's affordability for the uptick in enrollment. For a third consecutive year, the school did not raise tuition or related fees, nor room-and-board charges.
   
 Eighty-five percent of students at the university receive some form of financial aid.
   
 "In light of the challenges our students and their families have faced dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic, we believe holding the line on costs is the right thing to do,'' Newsom said.
   
 "From a revenue and budget standpoint, we are fortunate to be in a good position due to our sustained enrollment growth over the last three years. It is also important to note that our budget continues to support those services directly impacting academics and student success.''
   
 Southeastern previously announced this fall that it would offer a $1,500 tuition waiver for all first-time, full-time freshmen hailing from Oklahoma. It also awarded an automatic Associate Tuition Waiver Scholarship of $1,000 per semester to students who hold an Associate of Arts or Science degree.
   
 The school also made available seven Regional University Baccalaureate Scholarships, which provided full tuition plus $3,000 per year toward expenses for four years. Meanwhile, it expanded a policy providing all out-of-state undergraduate and graduate students an automatic 100 percent non-resident tuition waiver each semester.
   
 The university also distributed funds to students as part of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act.
   
 Newsom said accessibility has also had a role in the university's record growth, noting dramatic changes in the higher education model in recent years.
   
 "We will continue to be responsive to the needs of our students," he said.

Sometimes at night instead of watching television, I watch TikToks.
   
 One of the types of videos that I like the most are the ones where they try to explain southern or Texan talk to those who might now be from those places.
   
 Here are a few that made me laugh:
   
 "Do not address that subject" translates to "Don't kick that dog."
   
 To interfere with things that are not your concern is "Meddlin."
   
 I am angry "I am fit to be tied."
   
 To be arrogant "He thinks the sun comes up just to hear him crow."
   
 Correct your behavior "Stop being ugly."
   
 I don't care for that person - "He ain't worth knocking in the head."
   
 Not happy "Madder than a wet hen."
   
 Insignificant "It doesn't mount to a hill of beans."
   
 Ongoing "Till the cows come home."
   
 Slow down "Hold your horses."
   
 Not that good "Ain't the way momma made it."
   
 Done with this "Stick a fork in me, I'm done."
   
 Wait "Hold you're britches."
   
 Not straight "Cattywampas."
   
 Young "Knee high to a grasshopper."
   
 What would you add to this list?
   
 Do you consider this area of North Texas to be "the South" or do you think we, as a group, speak differently from those who consider themselves to be southern?
   
 While I was listening to the videos over the weekend, I didn't hear many things that I didn't immediately understand, so that leads me to believe that we do, as a general rule, speak "Southern" here in the North Texas and Southern Oklahoma area.

COVID-19 symptoms can include fever or chills, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, fatigue, muscle aches, headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, sore throat, new loss of taste and/or smell and congestion or runny nose.
 This testing will be conducted with assistance from the West Virginia National Guard and West Virginia University. For the time being, free testing will take place more frequently until Monongalia County’s numbers improve.
 Monongalia County’s status on the state’s County Alert System went into the red, the highest category, last week, which mandates more testing. The red alert means that the county has 25-plus positive COVID-19 cases per 100,000 residents.
 Nationwide, West Virginia is at the top of the list of states in which COVID-19 is spreading fastest with the highest Rt number. The Rt number represents the average number of people who become infected by an infectious person. West Virginia was No. 1 last week but Delaware, North Dakota and Wisconsin have since moved slightly ahead. That data can be viewed at https://rt.live.
 On Wednesday, Monongalia County had a total of 1,768 cases since the beginning of the pandemic six months ago. Monongalia County only had 162 COVID-19 cases as of June 30, but surges in July and again this month have made those numbers spike. In addition to testing, people should still wear masks, social distance and wash hands frequently and thoroughly in order to slow the spread.
 “We are still going in the wrong direction with these numbers,”Smith said. “People need to make good decisions in order to not only protect themselves and their families, but also the community.”

BELLS -- The Panthers understand better than most that how you finish is more important than how you start. But when you have a start like this, it certainly feels a lot better.
   
 With a lot more familiarity compared to this point a year ago and coming off one of the best seasons in school history, Bells has continued to build on that success.
   
 "I knew we'd be ahead of where we were last year," Bells head coach Dale West said. "Our kids are as bought-in as ever."
   
 Now the Panthers will face their biggest test of the season to date at the start of the toughest stretch in their schedule as Bells (3-0) travels to Holliday (2-1) to close out non-district play.
   
 So far Bells has played three opponents who are a combined 0-9 and Holliday is a step up in competition before Bells opens 8-3A (II) play next week against the two other teams considered to be in the running for a top seed -- Leonard and then defending state champion Gunter.
   
 "They're for sure going to be a really good gauge of where we're at," West said. "We need a team to prepare us for the district battles we're going to have early. Whether we're 0-4 or 4-0, we've got to put ourselves in position to peak when it really matters."
   
 The match-up with Holliday could also be a playoff preview. That was not a consideration when it came to filling out a schedule after they lost Ponder as the Week 4 opponent after realignment was completed.
   
 Bells has been running wild dating back to the start of district play last season. The Panthers went 1-3 before winning eight straight and reaching the 3A Division II Region III semifinals before losing against eventual state runner-up Paul Pewitt.
   
 The adjustment to the Slot-T from the spread may have taken a month to feel normal but now it's become second nature. And even though the offense lost Wrangler Priest, last year's district MVP with more than 1,600 yards and 21 TDs, the unit hasn't skipped a beat.
   
 Sophomore Brock Baker was elevated from the junior varsity and leads the team with 24 carries for 324 yards and two touchdowns. Junior Bo Baker is right behind with 305 yards and six touchdowns on 22 carries. Sophomore Grady Waldrip has added 36 carries for 244 yards and four TDs and junior quarterback Blake Rolen has a pair of scores among his 14 carries.
   
 "We can distribute the ball between any of them," West said. "They're a good young group. Those backs can make people miss."
   
 Bells had a second straight blowout last Friday in a 55-8 victory over Valley View. It was a similar script to the prior outing -- a 47-8 win against Howe. Both match-ups saw the Panthers race out to a large half-time advantage (40-0 against Howe, 42-0 against Valley View) with a late touchdown from the opposition ruining the shutout effort.
   
 In the win over Valley View, Bo Baker ran for 140 yards and three touchdowns on just five carries and also caught a pair of passes for 66 yards and a TD, Brock Baker gained 135 yards and a touchdown on four carries, Ezzy Carrasco totaled seven carries for 70 yards, Blake Rolen also ran for a touchdown to go with his TD pass and Waldrip chipped in five carries for 47 yards and a touchdown as the Panthers rolled up 509 yards of offense -- 420 of that on 32 carries.
   
 Kaden Pyle also returned the second-half kickoff 75 yards for a touchdown.
   
 While much of the focus has been on the offense, a defense led by Adian Brown, Cole Moore and Cooper Smith has allowed just a touchdown in each game. The unit opened the season with some timely goal-line stands in a 20-6 victory over Whitesboro -- where another late touchdown prevented Bells from another shutout.
   
 "We're a well-balanced team right now," West said. "Our defense is really good. The kids have been playing really, really physical. Our first-team defense hasn't been scored on yet."
   
 Holliday is coming off a 19-10 victory against Vernon. After opening the season with a 28-0 loss against Iowa Park, which is ranked sixth in the Class 4A Division II statewide rankings this week, the Eagles earned a comeback victory over Eastland, 29-28 in a game they trailed 28-7 at half-time.
   
 It took another rally last week against Vernon. Holliday was down 10-0 at half-time before pitching another second-half shutout to pull out a win with 11 points in the final four-plus minutes.
   
 Jaxx Johnson ran 11 times for 51 yards and a touchdown and Keegan Hutchins' lone catch from Peyton Marchand went for a 52-yard TD.
   
 Sadler Germany kicked a 28-yard field goal and Hunter Allen notched a safety for the Eagles, who held Vernon to 149 yards.
   
 Through three games, Johnson leads the team with 252 yards and three touchdowns on 34 carries while Austin Jones is next at 136 yards on 34 carries.
   
 Marchand has completed 12-of-28 passes for 161 yards and two touchdowns with five interceptions.
   
 Holliday has reached the 3A Division II Region II final the past two seasons and lost to Gunter both times after the Tigers had already beaten the Eagles in district play.
   
 "Holliday's a really good football team," West said. "It's going to be a dogfight."

Current areas of concern in West Virginia are Kanawha and Monongalia counties. Both counties are once again in the red in the state’s color-coded county alert system, which determines which counties can hold in-person school instruction and sporting events. The virus caseload in Monongalia County is largely contributed to West Virginia University.
 Sarah Armstrong Tucker, West Virginia chancellor of higher education, said state and national health experts both agree that the best way to deal with students who test positive for COVID-19 is to keep them on campus — in an isolated, secured and monitored location — so they cannot contribute to community spread of the virus.
 Justice said the key to tracking the spread of the virus is testing. He says the state is hoping to get to a point of testing as many as 7,000 people a day with a particular emphasis on counties that are red and orange.
 “We don’t want to achieve just the ability to go to school or play a game,” Justice said. “What we want to achieve is wellness in the county. We know there are many people out there who are spreaders who are spreading this and don’t even know they are sick. So if we can encourage more testing — and stop me from going through this and reading like I’m doing today about 10 more deaths — I’ve got to have tests. I’ve got to have bunches of tests. Especially in the super red counties.”
 Justice said 30 outbreaks are still being reported at long-term care facilities across the state. However, one previous outbreak site in Mercer County — the Princeton Health Care Center — is no longer being listed as an outbreak site by the state. There are no current residents or staff members at the nursing home who are positive with the virus. However, all 24 of Mercer County’s coronavirus deaths to date came from the Princeton Health Care Center.
 During the question and answer session of Wednesday’s pandemic briefing, Justice answered questions about the state’s color-coded alert system, and how it is confusing to some parents and state residents. He also was asked if the state was “lowering the bar” in order to get more children back into school with the color-coded system.
 That led to Justice once again defending the alert system, and the recent addition of a gold color. Gold is now in addition to green, yellow, orange and red classifications.
 “This one you already know the answer to,” Justice said. “Just like you said there already is no answer. You just have to do the best you can possibly do to live with this until we get the vaccine.”

First, it was Murray, stepping up in the pocket on second-and-nine, darting to his right, planting his foot in the ground to split a pair of 49ers defenders and then kick into high-gear to cruise past the pylon into the end zone, gifting Arizona a 17-13 lead with 10:26 to go.
 “That guy was running, today,” said safety Budda Baker, emphasizing that San Francisco’s front-seven is not one to be taken lightly. “Our O-line did a great job of trying to tame them, and Kyler, he did his thing…he did what God blessed him with, which is being very fast.”
 Then, it was Hopkins’ turn to dazzle, and capitalize what will, likely, be remembered as a career-defining showcase.
 Facing a decisive third-and-six — his new team trailing 20-17 — Hopkins crossed over the middle of San Francisco’s defense and secured, perhaps, the simplest of his 14 receptions. Then, instinctively, he turned upfield and hit the nitrous button, like Dom Toretto in the Fast & Furious franchise, and streamlined forward, end zone tunnel vision on full display.
 Hopkins, ultimately knocked off his path by safety Jaquiski Tartt, bounced to the ground merely feet shy of the goal-line. He didn’t score, but the damage had been inflicted. And, Cardinals running back Kenyan Drake punched in the go-ahead and, eventual, game-winning touchdown with just over five minutes remaining in the fourth quarter on the ensuing play.
 “He wants to win, first and foremost, and you sense that out on the sideline,” said Kingsbury, crediting Hopkins’ desire to compete, “it’s fun to be around. It’s fun for our guys to see that type of passion and that type of effort when he’s out there.”
 Keim has more reasons to celebrate, however, than solely for Hopkins’ eagerly- awaited, and sweeter-than-imagined debut in an Arizona uniform.
 The Cardinals general manager, who has served in the same role since 2013 — after getting his foot in the door with the franchise as a regional scout in 1999 — seemed to hit his stride this offseason, acquiring several notable defensive players in free agency.
 Only days after landing Hopkins, invigorating a rising offense, Keim turned his attention to Arizona’s defense, hoping to bolster second-year defensive coordinator Vance Joseph’s unit.
 Over a three-day period, Keim helped ink veteran defensive tackle Jordan Phillips to a three-year, $30 million contract, versatile linebacker De’Vondre Campbell to a one-year $8.5 million deal and homegrown product Devon Kennard to a multi-year agreement.
 By Sunday’s bar, the Cardinals’ defensive standards have certainly been elevated.
 Arizona limited San Francisco’s strapping cast of ball carriers to an afternoon-long rush of 16 yards.
 A revamped secondary, aided by veteran cornerback Dre Kirkpatrick —who signed with the team at the tail-end of August — held 49ers quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo, for the most part, in check. Garoppolo completed just 57 percent of his passes, and struggled to get into a groove with a limited supply of pass- catchers — starting wide receivers Deebo Samuel and Brandon Aiyuk, a 2020 first-round draft pick from Arizona State, were designated with injuries, therefore unable to compete in Sunday’s divisional showdown.
 Baker lived up to his monstrous billing, notching a team-high 15 tackles.
 Chandler Jones crept closer to 100 career sacks, bringing down Garoppolo in the second quarter.
 Patrick Peterson rejected an end zone heave —on San Francisco’s final drive — that felt like the opposition’s best chance to exit Sunday’s slugfest with a one in the win column.
 Most impressively, though, it was Keim’s latest roster-additions who set the tone and paved the way, defensively, for Arizona’s monumental week-one victory.

When you make big ones, that’s when people think, “Oh ok.” Yeah. I can make big ones. I was never one of those three point shooters that sit and be like Steph Curry shooting threes. Naw, that’s not what I do. I can make big threes and my three was used as a weapon to outdo another big guy. To make him respect me and come out and guard me. But I loved to post up. It was one of the easiest ways for me to score. When I got to the pros, I changed it up a little bit. Like I said, when Coach Pitino moved me to the power forward, that was one of the advantages that I had to being able to step out and hit shots."

Man United are said to have "balked" at the prospect of paying that much for a player of Bale's age, thus ruling them out of the running.
 In a recent interview, Bale told Sky Sports : "I want to play football. I am still motivated to play football so I guess it is on the club (Real Madrid) really. I can't do anything, they are in control of everything.
 "I have a contract so all I can do is carry on what I am doing an hopefully something comes up.
 "It is in the club's hands and they have made things very difficult to be honest."

West, the billionaire hip-hop artist and fashion mogul turned Christian revivalist, is not running for president but “walking,” as he puts it. He entered the race late and is not going to make the ballot in states including Florida, Texas and Michigan, but he will be on the ballot in others like Colorado, Minnesota and Iowa. Some Democrats fear he could be a spoiler, even if his political appeal is minuscule. Third-party candidacies don’t need that many votes to make an impact, as Jill Stein showed in 2016 and Ralph Nader in 2000.
 In calls and texts with The New York Times, and in other recent comments, West made clear he believes he will become president — eventually — but said almost nothing about what he actually wanted to do if elected. Indeed, West’s curio candidacy has confused many fans and voters alike. His party is called the Birthday Party. His first piece of campaign art included pictures of that well-known populist Anna Wintour, editor of Vogue, and of actress Kirsten Dunst, who was puzzled. (“What’s the message here,” she tweeted, “and why am I apart of it?”)
 An inescapable element of West’s candidacy is his bipolar disorder, which he has spoken about in the past. His wife, Kim Kardashian West, opened up about it for the first time days after West’s only campaign appearance, in South Carolina, during which he broke down crying. Writing on Instagram, she called him a “brilliant but complicated person” who has to deal with “pressure and isolation that is heightened by his bipolar disorder.”
 Because a variety of allies and supporters of President Donald Trump are working on the ground to advance his campaign, many Democrats view his candidacy as a dirty trick by Republicans, a notion that West has rejected. Still, in a year in which the president is working to undermine confidence in the election, West’s candidacy is one more point of uncertainty. And many Republicans, including Trump, appear confident he will siphon votes from Joe Biden, the Democratic nominee, although his appeal could be blunted by some of his conservative positions.
 West has a bare-bones platform, focusing on general objectives like reforming the police, reducing household and student loan debt, and “restoring prayer in the classroom,” with each point reinforced by a bit of scripture. In discussions, the topic he brought up most was his opposition to abortion. He does not, however, want to ban abortion.
 “You can’t do that,” he said in a phone call. “I don’t want to ban or stop or point fingers at anything.” Instead, he said he supported “stipends for families that need support, creating orphanages that are really high-level desirable for people to go to, and the redesign of communities and cities in general to be supporting of families.”
 He didn’t elaborate on his views on other issues when asked, saying at one point that he had an album to finish.
 On Wednesday, West renewed questions about his behaviour after tweeting a video in which someone appeared to urinate on a Grammy statuette; referring to himself as “baby Putin”; and, in a tweet that was removed by Twitter, posting the phone number of a top magazine editor whom he called a “white supremacist.”
 A number of consulting firms are aiding his candidacy. Mercury Public Affairs, a prominent bipartisan New York political consulting firm, played an organizing role, although the firm was dismissed last month and was reluctant to discuss the matter.
 “Our role was limited to helping the campaign get started up, primarily by helping to recruit a ballot access team and launch that effort,” said Michael McKeon, a partner at Mercury. “For a short time, we served as a liaison between the campaign and the team until they established independent relationships. That happened weeks ago, ending our involvement.”
 McKeon would not say why Mercury was not included in the companies that received disbursements in the West campaign’s recent filing to the Federal Election Commission, which showed that West had lent the campaign nearly $7 million.
 The filing showed that West had also brought on both a Republican-oriented firm, the Atlas Strategy Group, and a Democratic-leaning one, Millennial Strategies, to help get him on the ballot. Millennial, however, bailed out after less than a month on the job, shortly after his South Carolina appearance, during which he said that Harriet Tubman “never actually freed the slaves” and that “she just had the slaves go work for other white people.”
 Several Republican operatives were subsequently revealed to be aiding efforts to get West on the ballot, including Lane Ruhland, an election lawyer who has worked for the Trump campaign in Wisconsin; Rachel George, a Republican consultant in Colorado; and Atlas’ Gregg Keller, the former executive director of the American Conservative Union.
 Third-party candidacies, of course, can influence the outcome of an election. While a Morning Consult/Politico survey last month of 1,983 registered voters nationwide found that West had the support of only 2% of them, presidential elections in some states have been decided by less. In 2016, Trump and Hillary Clinton were separated by fewer than 23,000 votes in Wisconsin, where the Libertarian Party candidate, Gary Johnson, won close to 107,000 votes.
 “Winning the presidency can come down to a razor-thin margin in a single or handful of states,” Steffen Weiss, managing director of research science for Morning Consult, said in an email. “Any independent candidate on the ballot in a battleground state, Mr West included, could be consequential in an otherwise close race.”

Eddie: A study in 2013 shows that Wisconsin incarcerated more black men than any other state in the United States in spite of the fact that the black population is only 6.5%. Also, Wisconsin has a very high rate of incarceration for indigenous people. So in light of the recent events in Kenosha, the Department of Corrections building was burned to the ground. And I have with me today, two people that work with the Incarcerated Workers Organizing Committee to talk about Wisconsin, its prison population, and what's going on inside the prison in terms of organizing the incarcerated workers.

It's far too early to make final conclusions about an alleged fatal accident involving South Dakota Attorney General Jason Ravnsborg and Joseph Boever in rural Hyde county. The incident is being investigated by the Department of Public Safety, the Hyde County Sheriff's Office and the North Dakota Bureau of Criminal Investigation.
 Preliminary conclusions are that Ravnsborg was driving on the highway when he struck and killed Boever, who was walking along the roadway at about 10:30 p.m. Saturday.
 We should wait for the investigation to be completed before we make final conclusions. But we should still discuss the seemingly frequent accidents and close calls between vehicles and pedestrians.

Kern isn't willing to take credit for all of the work which led to the award.
 "The people around me made it happen," he said, naming both Lindquist and Gewei Cheng, the controller Kern said is "in charge of the global picture."
 Kern was surprised to be named Developer of the Year, in part because he thought the folks in Phoenix, Ariz., might have gotten tired of visiting with him. After signing up for four franchises, he engaged in numerous conversations involving value engineering, a way of reducing costs while increasing functionality.
 "You don't want to compromise their brand, but you don't want to overbuild, either," he said.
 The goal was to save money while ensuring the new construction would be structurally sound. Kern said that creates a win-win situation for the developer. In this case, his suggestions also proved to be win-win for others affiliated with Best Western.
 "They used that [Kern's ideas] with their other developers," he said. "At the end of the day, they can build these [hotels] for less money as well."
 While Kern was honored to accept the award last week, he believes he did it on behalf of his team.
 "We have a really dynamic team that made this happen," he said.
 Tom Busch, director of development for Best Western Hotels, did not offer any insight into why Kern was selected to receive the award, but he did say the company is "especially pleased" to have Kern as a partner.
 "We are extremely proud to be associated with Brian's talented team," Busch indicated via text.

He started work in Moscow in 1989 as a publisher of books and magazines about Russian life, moved to Montpelier in 1990, continued with publications about Russia, and shifted much of his business focus in 2008 to helping businesses tell their stories. Clients range from large nonprofits and arts festivals to small- and mid-sized companies.
 “When Russia started invading all its neighbor we needed to emphasis the non Russian side of our business,” he said. “We weren’t sure how long a Russia focus would be viable.”
 Richardson gained an affinity of Russian life when he enrolled in Russian Area Studies at Indiana University in Bloomington. He moved to Russia in 1989 and lived there for two years, where met Vermonter David Kelley, an attorney and a co-founder of Project Harmony (now PH International). Project Harmony was founded in 1985 for the purpose of cultural and educational exchanges between the then USSR and the United States.
 Richardson moved to Vermont to work with Kelley.
 “We were in business together about a year-and-a-half. We also did some projects together in Russia,” he said.
 Although most of Richardson’s clients are located out of state, he has several Vermont customers including Leader Evaporator Company of Swanton, the largest U.S. manufacturer of equipment needed by maple syrup producers. “We are helping them explain to their clients who they are so they can sell more of their product,” he said.
 StoryWorkz also has a variety of smaller Vermont clients, ranging from construction companies, to bakeries, to consulting firms.
 Jon Wagner and Karin Bellemare, co-owners of Bear Roots farm in Williamstown and South Barre, are featured on StoryWorkz brochure.
 Two of his biggest clients are the Festival of the Arts Boca, in Boca Raton, Florida, and the Festival of Napa Valley in California, two of the most successful arts festivals in the country.
 “We help them build their annual magazine, their brochure, photography, and much more,” he said.
 Storyworkz’s main work focus in on four topic: Words, “Words used well”; Video, “Video does not have to be expensive”; Web, “A website should be ab engine for growth”; and Design, “Simplicity and clarity equal design.”
 Richardson’s expertise is photography.
 “Humans are hard-wired for visual stimuli. As a species, we remember 10% of what we hear, 20% of what we read, but 80% of what we experience visually,” he said.

“Fall sports is a hot topic,” TUSD Superintendent Gabrial Trujillo said at last Wednesday’s school board meeting. “No superintendent is taking that decision lightly and doing the best each superintendent can to keep their community and (school) boards updated.”
 Trujillo said health department officials are watching two variables before approving the fall season for high school contact sports—an increase in cases following Labor Day weekend celebrations and the first full month of University of Arizona back in session. However, there is a good chance the season could be up and running by Oct. 19 if all goes well, said the superintendent.
 “There was some good news from my meeting with Pima County Health Department leadership,” Trujillo said. “If the COVID-19 transmission data continues to trend downward, then it is possible for a post-fall authorization of games and matches.”
 Catalina Foothills High School sent an email to parents of student athletes last week announcing Phase One of their program to bring back low risk activities. The email did not give a set date for practice to resume, or what low-risk activities would be included in the first phase. However, the district is urging their athletes to complete all the necessary paperwork needed so the school is ready when they are cleared to return to the fall season.
 Marana High School varsity football coach Louie Ramirez said his team has been participating in low-impact workouts without pads for the past three weeks. Conditioning practices are voluntary and athletes who choose not to participate won’t be excluded from future football games, said the coach.
 “We have a couple of kids who have parents with underlying issues or their parents are in the medical field and didn’t feel comfortable signing a waiver for them to participate,” Ramirez said. “I’m not going to force them to be here and there’s no repercussions if they don’t show up, as far as playing time goes.”
 Ramirez was hoping his team would be able to start full-contact practicing this week, but those plans have been tentatively pushed to the following Monday, Sept. 21. That date could be pushed back again if case numbers rise this week. It’s all in the hands of the health department and local superintendents, said Ramirez.
 “Everything changes, but we’re looking to start pretty soon,” Ramirez said. “I think the Tucson superintendents are really trying to stay united and have all of Tucson start at the same time. It’s just up in the air as far as what decision they’re going to make.”

Election day is quickly approaching us. On the ballot, three College Station city council seats are up for grabs. My vote is going to Dell Seiter, Elizabeth Cunha and Jason Cornelius, and yours should too. Together, these candidates will stand up for students, welcome business to the city and tackle issues that matter. I interviewed all three candidates about their platforms, and here’s what I found.
 My first interview was with Dell Seiter, a retired Marine and veteran of the mortgage industry, who has lived in College Station since 1987.

Murphy’s determination to compete no matter what may have been a contributing factor to her hip’s original break almost 10 years ago. Murphy, with a laugh, said the cause of the original break is not a good story.
 “I had a little hip pain for about a month but I kept doing everything on it, and then I tripped getting out of a parked car,” Murphy said. “It was a hairline fracture but I kept pounding it like riding and doing all that, so it finally just gave way. I had an appointment to get it looked at that was scheduled for the next day, but I couldn’t make it that far.”
 The end result allows Murphy to look back on the incident with humor. Murphy said everything felt easy when she came back because she no longer had pain weighing her down.
 “My first day back on a horse my physical therapist said, ‘Okay, take it easy. Only 20 minutes. I don’t want you doing too much,’ and that was longer than I’d been able to sit on a horse in two years,” Murphy said. “It was really exciting and empowering to go back to being able to do all these normal daily activities pain-free.”
 Upon returning to the team as a junior, Murphy was voted team leader and returned to competing in fences, tallying four wins. Her determination to overcome the adversity she faced makes her an inspiration to the team, senior and Murphy’s roommate Mali Selman said.
 “I think everyone on the team looks up to her. I look up to her,” Selman said. “She’s just a really good example of, what I think, and I think the coaches would say this too, everyone on the team wants to be. If we had 25 Rhians we’d be a really well functioning, well-competing team.”
 Murphy’s sophomore season of struggle and grit granted her the Lohman Inspiration Award at A&M Athletics’ annual Building Champions Awards that May. With her optimistic nature, Selman said Murphy is someone who unironically enjoys inspirational phrases.
 “She drives around with a sticker on her car that [the equestrian team] put on there as a joke and it says, ‘She believes she could so she did’ and it’s glittery,” Selman said. “We joke about it all the time because she’s definitely someone that’s into the inspirational quotes and all that.”
 This fall, Murphy will return to competition, continuing her position as team leader.
 “I feel super honored,” Murphy said. “All of these girls on this team are all so great. They’re girls that I look up to everyday. I hold them in such high regard that, to have them think of me as a leader, is just a really great feeling.”

High school sports across Pima County are returning to practice in anticipation for the fall season after the Arizona Interscholastic Association gave the green light to proceed in early September as state metrics show COVID-19 cases on a downward trend.
 Tucson Unified School District recently announced fall sports like golf, cross-country and swimming can begin competitive play, “effective immediately,” since they meet social distancing requirements while having minimal contact. Other county school districts like Catalina Foothills, Amphitheater and Marana Unified are also working on bringing those sports back for the fall season.
 However, the Pima County Health Department is putting the brakes on sports with potentially high transmission rates—like football and volleyball—until the Old Pueblo reaches minimum levels of community spread. Athletes of those sports are allowed to practice and condition as a team, but full contact practice is not authorized and no match-ups have been scheduled for the fall season.

In respect of start of production of the OXE300 with the Company's assembly partner PanLink, preparations are going according to plan. Nevertheless, the global COVID-19 crisis has impacted several of the Company's key suppliers for the OXE300, and the Company has concluded that ramping-up production during Q4 2020 at the pace necessary to meet the 50 percent revenue growth target for 2020 would come at a risk that cannot be justified in light of the Company's longer term objectives. Consequently, the Company has today resolved not to ramp-up production with PanLink at the pace necessary to meet the 2020 financial target and instead focus on ensuring steady state production in 2021 to deliver on the Company's order book for the OXE300 with unimpaired quality.

Sally blew ashore near Gulf Shores, Alabama, Wednesday morning as a major hurricane with 105 mph (165 kph) winds. It moved slowly, exacerbating the effect of heavy rains. More than 2 feet (61 centimeters) fell near Naval Air Station Pensacola, and nearly 3 feet (1 meter) of water covered streets in downtown Pensacola, the National Weather Service reported.Some Pensacola streets looked like rivers with whitecaps at times. The waters swamped parked cars before receding. A replica of Christopher Columbus' ship the Nina was missing from where it was docked at the Pensacola waterfront, police said. The ship was later seen run aground in downtown Pensacola, Pensacola News Journal reported.The storm was a nerve-racking experience for University of West Florida student Brooke Shelter. She was wide awake Wednesday morning as strong winds and rainfall battered her home, marking her first experience with a hurricane. “The damage around my home is pretty minor, for which I am thankful for,” Shelter said. “However, it is so sad seeing how flooded downtown is.”Sally weakened to a tropical depression late Wednesday and picked up speed. The National Hurricane Center said the system was moving through southeast Alabama, would cross over central Georgia on Thursday and reach South Carolina on Thursday night. Flash flooding and some river flooding was possible in each state.The forecasts called for 4 inches (10 centimeters) to 8 inches (29 centimeters) of rain in southeast Alabama and central Georgia by Thursday night, with up to 1 foot (30 centimeters) in some spots, posing a threat of significant flash flooding and “minor to moderate” river floods.In South Carolina, as much as 10 inches (25 centimeters) of rain was possible; in North Carolina, up to 8 inches. Some flash flooding and river flooding was a possibility in those states, the weather service said.Trent Airhart wades through floodwaters, Wednesday, Sept. 16, 2020, in downtown Pensacola, Fla. Hurricane Sally made landfall Wednesday near Gulf Shores, Alabama, as a Category 2 storm, pushing a surge of ocean water onto the coast and dumping torrential rain.Kennon said the damage in Orange Beach was worse than that from Hurricane Ivan, which hit 16 years to the day earlier. In a Facebook briefing for city residents, Kennon said distribution points would be established Thursday for water, ice and tarps. “It was an unbelievably freaky right turn of a storm that none of us ever expected,” Kennon said of Sally, which once appeared to have New Orleans in its sights.Well over a half-million homes and businesses were without electricity in Alabama and Florida, according to the poweroutages.us website. Many faced extended time without power. “We don’t want to sugar coat this; we’re in it for the long haul,” one utility posted on social media.At least eight waterways in south Alabama and the Florida Panhandle were expected to hit major flood stage by Thursday. Some of the crests could break records, submerge bridges and flood some homes, the National Weather Service warned. Included in the warnings were the Styx and Fish rivers, Murder Creek and Big Escambia Creek. In Florida, major crests were expected on the Perdido, Blackwater, Shoal and Yellow rivers, forecasters said.Brewton, Alabama, a city of about 5,200, can expect moderate to major flooding, said meteorologist Steve Miller of the National Weather Service office in Mobile. Silverhill, an Alabama town of about 1,200, was threatened by the Fish River, which had crested, and Seminole, an Alabama village on the Florida state line, by the still rising Styx River, Miller said.As a hurricane, Sally tore loose a barge-mounted construction crane, which then smashed into the new Three Mile Bridge over Pensacola Bay, causing a section of the year-old span to collapse, authorities said. The storm also ripped away a large section of a fishing pier at Alabama’s Gulf State Park on the very day a ribbon-cutting had been scheduled following a $2.4 million renovation.The hurricane center was tracking two other Atlantic storms: Hurricane Teddy, with a forecast track that could put it over Bermuda by Monday; and Tropical Storm Vicky, expected to dissipate in the Atlantic in the coming days. ___Wang reported from Mobile, Alabama, and Martin, from Marietta, Georgia.

This constant need to tell the truth is seen very explicitly in the works of Baldwin, whom Coates argues might be "America's greatest essayist." Baldwin's books such as "Notes of a Native Son," "If Beale Street Could Talk," "Go Tell It on the Mountain" and his magnum opus, "The Fire Next Time" are the most relevant works on race written about America that I have come across in my lifetime. His mission was to end the institution of white supremacy — and he spared no punches while doing so. He understood that “to be [Black] in this country and to be relatively conscious is to be in a rage almost all the time." But he also knew never to stoop as low as the people oppressing you no matter the anger you feel deep in your soul. He believed "white people cannot, in the generality, be taken as models of how to live. Rather, the white man is himself in sore need of new standards." The inflictions of white supremacy speak more on the white world's inhumanity rather than the invented inferiority of African Americans.
 Although he is primarily known for his works on race, the common themes of love and hope are ever-present in all of his writing. He knew America's racist problems would cease only when white people in this country knew how to accept and love themselves because only then would they stop using hate and deal with the pain their actions have produced for centuries. Baldwin has been my guiding light during moments of existential crisis. I have found safety and reassurance that things have to get better and love will be the only path to it.
 My favorite line of his states, "I can't be a pessimist because I am alive… I am forced to believe that we can survive, whatever we must survive." It is an extremely simple and straightforward line that emphasizes the need to have hope continuously. He knew "the most dangerous creation of any society is the man who has nothing to lose." The stakes of losing hope are also the stakes of America as a nation. It will determine the altitude of this country, and the "future of the Negro in this country is precisely as bright or as dark as the future of the country."
 In Baldwin and other Black authors' works, I realized hope was something that had to be invented every day. Even in the context of a pandemic and national unrest, we have to work toward the belief that tomorrow will be a better day. We have to actively invent hope in that context and always tell the truth so we may be able to free ourselves and create a better world for the future.

Ironically, the Congress Party, which dances to the tune of the _uchch koti_ (upper-tier), _Janeudhari, Kaul-Dattatreya gotra Brahmin_ - Rahul Gandhi, has time and again expressed its adherence to the anti-Hindu E V Ramasamy, popularly known as EVR and hailed as ‘Periyar’ by his followers. Today, once again the disciples of this ' _janeudhari Brahmin_ ' have taken to the microblogging site Twitter to pay homage to the demagogue, who used the social evils which were then prevalent or perceived, as a capital for his propaganda.

Validation efforts will place particular emphasis on how TV data will be integrated with digital data within the proposal.
 Both initiatives will focus on ensuring the priorities of advertisers are met while also taking an approach that reflects the needs of broadcasters as well as the changing digital media landscape.
 Several other markets and organisations are also looking closely at the components in the proposal, with a view to possible implementation on the back of the US and UK work, the WFA said.
 Other organisation and brands involved in the work include Union des Marques (FR), OWM (DE), The Media Rating Council, Deutsche Telekom, Mars, Mastercard, Nestlé, PepsiCo, Procter & Gamble, The Coca-Cola Company and Unilever.
 “We need complete, open, transparent and future-proofed cross-media measurement to enable consumers to have a better viewing experience with less annoying repetition, advertisers to be confident that their media budgets are being invested effectively and efficiently, and media companies to be rewarded for delivering high levels of reach and engagement," Kanishka Das, senior director of global media analytics and insights at Procter & Gamble, said in the statement.
 Other industry leaders such as Ben Jankowski, senior vice-president of Media at Mastercard, indicated that piecing together this offering has been a long and complex process, with all parties dealing with not just technical challenges, but also "breaking down barriers that have been established by decades of legacy ways of working".
 To really work, in each geography, a lot of work needs to be done to bring it to life. While the offering is being tested in the US and UK, marketers and advertisers need to surmount different challenges in local markets to make the cross-plaform solution effective, reckons Norman Wagner, head of group media at Deutsche Telekom.
 “Cross-media measurement is a global topic that needs to be answered locally, as every region has different starting positions and demands... (this solution) has the potential to be adopted around the globe and enrich independent local measurement ecosystems,” he added.      A version of this article originally appeared on Campaign Asia

The unlikeliest of acquisitions paid dividends for the Cardinals in week one.
 Hopkins posted a career-best 14 catches on 16 targets for 151 yards. He was practically unguardable, and far and away Murray’s favorite option.
 In comparison, four of Houston’s starting wide receivers combined to tally 13 grabs for 163 yards in their season-opening loss to the Kansas City Chiefs on Thursday night. Texans quarterback Deshaun Watson missed Hopkins’ presence on the outside dearly. So did coach Bill O’Brien.
 “I think Steve’s done a tremendous job of bringing in pieces this year … that we feel like fit our scheme and can have (an) immediate impact,” said Cardinals coach Kliff Kingsbury during the team’s final week of training camp.
 It was also Keim’s decision to move on from quarterback Josh Rosen and commit to Murray, a choice that followed several difficult years, including the general manager’s guilty plea of extreme DUI in 2018.
 He appears to have hit his stride.
 In lieu of fans Sunday, and in the thick of troublesome air quality, Murray and Hopkins combined to treat viewers at home with a two-man offensive spectacle in the Cardinals’ 24-20 victory over the 49ers.
 Murray completed 65 percent of his passes en route to throwing for 230 yards. He dumped off a 10-yard touchdown pass to change-of-pace back Chase Edmonds, set up by a blocked punt, halfway through the first quarter. He added a total of 91 yards via 13 carries the old-fashioned way, as well.
 “This is the most proud I’ve been of him, to date,” Kingsbury said after the game, “because that is a tough defense and you get those monsters coming after you for four quarters. It’s not easy to sit back there and continue to hang in the pocket, continue to make plays with your feet, and he just kept fighting.”
 The former first overall pick and Hopkins, a prodigious pass-catcher, were the winners once the clock struck triple zeros and cardboard cutouts of fans, well, continued to sit still.
 “I didn’t know that he was going to go for that many catches, but he got hot and Kyler and him got in a rhythm,” Kingsbury said. “I’m just excited that he’s part of our organization.”
 Overall, Arizona’s offense was a bit dull; lacked explosive, down-the-field plays in the passing game and struggled in the early going to effectively run between tackles.
 “It wasn’t pretty early,” Kingsbury said. “Players are rusty. I was rusty with my play-calling and they did a great job, defensively.”
 But the Cardinals never batted an eye. Murray’s legs and Hopkins’ reliability bailed Arizona’s offense out of a bind in the contest’s witching hour. The duo continually displayed effortless chemistry and gravitated toward one another with momentum and points in jeopardy.

In recent weeks, there have been news reports of vehicles hitting pedestrians in Sioux Falls. We've read about vehicle-pedestrian accidents on Native American reservations. We've heard of close calls between vehicles and pedestrians, as well as the angry exchanges that have occurred afterward.
 In many cases, we believe, both parties can share blame. Drivers may be texting, changing a radio station or otherwise distracted. There is no question that enforcement of distracted driving laws should continue to be a public safety priority.
