He claims he met with Hariri seven times, who always gave the green light but mysteriously never pushed the project forward himself, which made Harfouch wary of the Lebanese former Prime Minister.
 "The Mayor of Tripoli led a campaign against the new factory by civil society. At the same time, I am hearing stories about three incinerators each one USD 170 million, but in fact, the real price is 120, so 50 million, I don't know where it goes..." says Harfouch.
 "Hariri was very sincere with me, but each time I went to the PM, a lobby went to him [later] to tell him that with the incinerators, one will get 10m, another one another 10m, so I understood there was a big corruption scheme which wanted to kick me out of Lebanon, even going so far as to spread rumours that I was a Mossad spy," Harfouch explains.
 His dealings with Mikati, whose net worth is believed to be closer to $5 billion (rather than the $2.5 billion suggested on Wikipedia), are also bizarre if not alarming. Harfouch claims that initially Mikati threatened him and said over a telephone that he could have him "disappear".
 It's for this reason why Harfouch is afraid to return to Lebanon. He claims the threats he has received are genuine. He says that Mariani now is the man to take the Lebanon dossier forward and expose the embezzlement along with the help (presently) of two Italian right-wing MEPs.
 "Mariani is very brave. He is anti-corruption. He understood that many MEPs in the European parliament want to help," he explains. "Once Mariani starts something, he will never stop. Everyone knows he's clean. He's poor, and he lives in a very small flat in Paris. Mariani is ready to go to Lebanon in February with a delegation to follow up on the investigation and find out where this EU money has gone."

Mnuchin said at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland that the United States regards digital services taxes such as the one imposed by France, and being planned by the United Kingdom and Italy, as being unfair to American tech companies.   President Donald Trump and his French counterpart, Emmanuel Macron, agreed this week to a truce over the issue after the White House threatened to significantly increase tariffs on French goods such as wine, cheese and handbags. France has already introduced a 3% tax on digital services.   Asked what would happen if Britain moves ahead with its tax, Mnuchin said that Washington would consider imposing tariffs on UK car exports.   "If people just want to just arbitrarily put taxes on our digital companies, we'll consider arbitrarily putting taxes on car companies," said Mnuchin. The Trump administration official cautioned, however, that he was confident the issue would be resolved.   UK finance minister Sajid Javid, who was also on the panel, said he planned to go ahead with the digital services tax in April, even as the country seeks to negotiate a new free trade deal with the United States following Brexit.   "We're going to have some private conversations. I'm sure this will be worked out, if not at our level then between the prime minister and the president who have an excellent relationship," Mnuchin added.   The best solution, both officials agreed, would be a global resolution that establishes new rules for how countries can collect taxes on digital services sold by companies based in other markets. Negotiations are underway at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.   UK car exports   Higher tariffs on cars made in the United Kingdom would be another massive blow to an industry that has been slammed by Brexit.   Nearly four years of uncertainty over leaving the European Union has caused UK auto production to decline for 17 of the past 18 months, according to the UK Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. Production dropped 17% in November, the most recent month for which data is available.   The global automakers who have built factories in Britain fear that leaving the European Union will result in new barriers to trade with their biggest market. That would snarl their supply chains, disrupt production and erode profit margins that are already razor thin.   US tariffs would also harm the industry. According to the SMMT, nearly 20% of UK car exports are to the United States.

The construction at Hollywood Park isn’t limited to a stadium that has more than doubled in cost and been delayed by a year.
 Workers buzz around a long, wing-like appendage that juts from the venue, housing an open-air plaza and a 6,000-seat performance theater. NFL Media is building a facility next door.
 Standing at the railing on the eighth level, Demoff points south to a tiered lake that will serve as the centerpiece for 20 acres of adjoining parkland.
 “Every decision we make,” he said, “has our fans in mind.”
 But the physical elements of the stadium are merely a starting point for him. He talks about creating an atmosphere that extends beyond concrete, earth and steel.
 The shape of the bowl and its canopy should make for a louder environment than at the Coliseum. He promises the fan council will have a say in the look of the venue.

Harfouch specifically fingers the NGOs and the mayor of Tripoli for falling for the promises of a share of this cake (incinerators) which he claims is why his French plant was blocked at the last moment, and he became the subject of a smear campaign which linked him to Mossad and tarnished the proposed plant as "homosexual".  
 Remarkably, the initial proposal came with quite some political clout from France. In July 2018, a French delegation of MPs visited the present EU-funded plant in Tripoli which was causing the stink in the first place - both metaphorically (corruption) and literally. The idea came from a French MP called Nathalie Goulet.
 Harfouch initially met with politicians in Tripoli who asked France to help. He also met with Tripoli billionaire and former PM Najib Mikati and President Michel Aoun who both said if he could find a solution, they would support it - a hollow if not disingenuous offer, it would transpire.
 Ominously though, there were signs even then, that his proposal would fail as it didn't include one vital ingredient: the kickback or ' _baksheesh_ ' element.
 "Lebanon did not accept my project as no one took [bribery] money from it," Harfouch tells _TRT World_ in a phone call.
 "Even everyone used to ask me how to get money from it, but I used to say 'there is no money' he explains. In Lebanon, international aid deals or such grants usually have a built-in facility to allow those on the ground to skim money from the scheme. Projects which don't have this - or which don't have sponsors who are prepared to turn a blind eye to embezzlement - typically fall at the first hurdle."
 And indeed, Harfouch's project did not allow for such a scheme. Perhaps worse, he _told_ people there in Tripoli that it did not, therefore assuring its failure.

 However, both the Galaxy 2020 A series devices are close to arriving on Indian shores.

Additionally, the Samsung Galaxy A50, A50s, A70 and A70s have recently received price cuts in India, which could hint to the imminent launch of the Galaxy A51 and A71.
 A report from 91Mobiles claimed that the Samsung Galaxy A51 would arrive in India towards the end of January, while the Galaxy 71 may debut in the country as early as the second week in February. The Galaxy A51 has already arrived in some European markets and is priced starting from 340 euros (Approx. Rs 26,900), while the Galaxy 71 will start at 419 euros (Approx. Rs 39,000) in the UK.

 "If, for example, the league could agree to come forward and play on the Friday night - if you had all of the fixtures on the Friday night - then it makes sense that you have the Saturday and Sunday for the players to recover, and three working days into the game on the Thursday.
 "We never requested a shutdown - all we asked for was common sense and if the broadcasters wouldn't put a game on on the Sunday.
 "But we also know there's the potential for Celtic and Rangers to hopefully still be involved in the Europa League the week before [the Scotland game], which would mean they'd have to play on the Sunday.
 "If that's the case then we have to deal with it. What I will say is that I'm pretty sure the players, when it comes to that match, whether they've got a week to prepare or a day to prepare, they'll be ready for the game."
 The SPFL say there have been talks with the SFA about the possibility of moving games to the Friday, but that it would be problematic because of the Europa League fixtures Celtic or Rangers will have to play if they reach the last 16.

One of my favorite holiday movies is "Home Alone." In the 1990 comedy, the McCallister family is planning a trip to Paris for the holidays, but oversleeps on the morning of their departure, which causes havoc. In their rush leave, the family accidentally forgets their youngest child, 8-year-old Kevin, and leave him home alone.      Chances are, you've seen the movie and you probably know the antics that ensue as Kevin protects the family's Chicago home from burglars.      But a scene I've always loved is the one of the large family rushing through the airport and barely making it on the plane. They get settled and after the plane takes off, the mother gasps "KEVIN!"      Now, I've never forgotten a child at home while on vacation, thank God. Vacations are stressful enough.      And while I've always loved the scene of the family rushing through the airport, trying to get to the gate on time, it's recently occurred to me how simpler things must have been for airline passengers in a pre-9/11 world.      The McAllister family obviously wasn't delayed by security. They didn't have to take off their shoes and their jackets. They didn't have to go through a full body scan machine. You don't see Kevin's family dragging carry-on size suitcases through the terminal in their rush for the gate. Today, the cost of checked luggage is so high, but back then then it was free.      And chances are, the parents didn't have to worry about what food options there were in that terminal because in 1990 most flights still provided food other than pretzels. (Although, I suppose, a transcontinental flight to Europe still provides meals.)      Last month, my family of five flew to California for New Year's. It was part family vacation - we took the kids to Disneyland and the San Diego Zoo. But it was a serious trip too, as we finally had a memorial service for our dad and spread some of his ashes at sea. We also finished emptying out the family home of the last 50 years.      We spent every second of that trip trying to make memories and enjoy the time with the kids, which meant the last day was rushed. Thirty minutes after our original "leave" time for the airport, I was still trying to cram everything into our carry-on size suitcases.      There were five of us, including our 10, 8 and 4-year-old kids. And there were six suitcases, five which were carry-on size (I'm not paying a fortune to check suitcases), three backpacks, a purse, my grandmother's ashes in an urn and a Star Wars robot from Disneyland. We looked like a herd of bogged-down camels, rushing to get to the airport.      Despite leaving later than planned, we returned the rental car and got to the terminal in decent time. We exited the rental car shuttle, entered an elevator that took us to the ticketing section of Terminal 4 at LAX airport, and then headed for the American Airlines desk. When we got to the self-help kiosk to get our boarding passes, I stopped to count my children. There were two - but we have three children.      "Where's Eliza?" I asked my two oldest kids, referring to their 4-year-old little sister. They shrugged. I asked my husband, in panic, "Where's Eliza?" He looked at our kids, then looked down the terminal where we had just dragged all of our belongings.      I shouted. "ELIZA?!?" which reverberated against the terminal's two-story ceilings. People turned around to look. I shouted again. My husband then dropped the bags and ran.      I told our older kids not to move and to stay with the bags, and then also ran down the ticketing hall, shouting Eliza's name.      She wasn't even in the building.      She was only gone a couple of minutes at most. A kind stranger saw my panicked husband and pointed him outside, where our scared pre-schooler stood on the sidewalk outside the airport next to the traffic. An airline attendant noticed our daughter all alone and was holding her hand. For that, I am so grateful.      Apparently, when we boarded the elevator as we first entered the airport, there were two doors, one that led inside the airport, and the other, which led back outside. As we exited the elevator toward the ticketing hall inside LAX, our daughter thought we were going back outside, and had walked through the wrong door.      Unlike "Home Alone" it was no comedy situation. It will probably be one of those moments I'll tell my grandkids about one day, the time we lost a kid in LAX. Hopefully by then we'll be able to laugh about it. For now, I'm still trying to calm my nerves.   Lydia Seabol Avant writes The Mom Stop for The Tuscaloosa News in Tuscaloosa, Alabama.
