PT-112 is a novel small molecule conjugate of pyrophosphate that possesses a unique pleiotropic mechanism of action that promotes immunogenic cell death (ICD), through the release of damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) that bind to dendritic cells and lead to downstream immune effector cell recruitment in the tumor microenvironment. PT-112 represents the best-in-class small molecule inducer of this immunological form of cancer cell death and is currently under Phase II development. The ﬁrst in-human study of PT-112 demonstrated an attractive safety proﬁle and evidence of long-lasting responses among heavily pre-treated patients and won "Best Poster" within the Developmental Therapeutics category at the ESMO 2018 Annual Congress. The novelty of PT-112's pyrophosphate moiety also results in osteotropism, or the propensity of the drug to reach the mineralized bone. This property is of interest in cancer types that originate in or metastasize to the bone. The combination Phase Ib study of PT-112 with PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibitor avelumab in solid tumors was reported in an oral presentation at the ESMO 2020 Virtual Congress.

Bloomberg) -- The pound looks poised for gains ahead of U.S elections, yet whether it can maintain momentum after the vote is still questionable.
 Option risk reversals show traders are no longer bearish the U.K. currency over a one-week horizon, opening the way for an advance before the Nov. 3 vote in America. Behind the shift in this gauge of positioning and sentiment lies the latest progress in Brexit negotiations, and a bias in the market to sell the dollar in the run-up to the election.
 Whether the currency manages to hit fresh highs or sustain gains thereafter, however, still depends largely on how negotiations between the U.K and the European Union pan out. The market’s overall risk appetite given uncertainty surrounding the pandemic will also prove key.
 The pound drifted against the dollar on Tuesday, after bouncing back from the psychologically important $1.30 handle early in the session. According to traders in Europe, leveraged funds were fading the move lower, with institutional investors looking to add topside sterling exposure in the options space.
 Charts are also working in cable’s favor. The currency remains within a bullish trend channel in both the short and medium term. Meanwhile, momentum gauges such as Bloomberg’s fear-and-greed indicator show bulls remain in control of price action.
 But caution is still warranted. Sterling reached a six-week high of $1.3177 on Oct. 21, only to falter again as profit taking kicked in. Corporate selling on a hedging basis has also been a key element in this pullback, according to a trader in Europe familiar with the transactions who asked not to be identified because he is not authorized to speak publicly.
 And the outlook further out into the future still remains murky. One-month risk-reversals remain in bearish territory for sterling as investors look for an official resolution in Brexit talks before turning bullish in the longer- term too.
 According to Bloomberg’s option-pricing model, the chances of the pound trading 5% higher in six months time are slightly higher than the probability of an equivalent drop.

Despite its reputation as the Start-Up Nation internally, Israel's hi-tech sector is beginning to be seen as stagnant on the world stage, according to a new study commissioned by Vibe Israel.
 Since the book Start-up Nation: The Story of Israel's Economic Miracle by Dan Senor and Saul Singer was published in 2009, Israel has enjoyed a positive reputation for its thriving tech sector, including many noteworthy start-ups and innovations. This served to become a major part of the country's global brand, and prompted major interest from foreign firms such as Intel and Facebook to expand into the country.
 However, it would seem this strategy worked too well, and eleven years later, the Start-Up Nation label is no longer exclusive to the Jewish state. and within four years, Israel could be seen as just an average hi-tech player on the world stage.
 "Ten years ago, when the world was coming out of the 2008 economic crisis, the 'Start-Up Nation' concept really resonated since Israel was one of the few countries that managed to weather the storm of the crisis almost unscathed," Vibe Israel Founder and CEO Joanna Landau said in a statement.
 "But it worked so well that by 2020, 'Start-Up Nation' has become a term used by many other countries promoting themselves as hubs of innovation and entrepreneurship. Just like a company would not maintain a slogan that no longer differentiates it from its competitors, Israel too needs a new business narrative. With crisis comes opportunity, and we believe that now is the time to develop a new marketing message and strategic work plan for the years ahead."
 Indeed, studies showed that the term "start-up nation" when searched online usually relates to other countries who use the term to boost their own hi-tech profile. This, Landau explained, is due to the same book that helped popularize Israel's own success story.
 "It essentially acted as a guidebook for other countries to make their own successful start-up nation," she explained, adding that the timing of the book's release, around Veteran's Day, was no accident, as many soldiers were coming home from Iraq or Afghanistan.
 In other countries, they would give these important hi-tech jobs to graduates from major universities like Harvard, Landau said. Israel, however, would often employ soldiers who are straight out of their IDF service. "The lesson this book taught other countries is not to overlook these soldiers, because they might have the exact qualities you're looking for."
 But while other countries have adopted the Start-Up Nation marketing brand, Israel's brand is now becoming stale, even if its hi-tech sector is as thriving as ever. The problem, Landau explained, is that Israel has become a white label, and is missing out on the "Country of Origin" effect enjoyed by countries such as Germany or Japan.
 "We're making all these things for foreign firms like Facebook, Intel, Ebay, but we aren't insisting we take credit," she said, adding that this applies to other Israeli firms as well.
 "Look at the top ten Israeli unicorns, their websites don't mention Israel at all," she said. While some do this because they might be trying to conduct business in countries without ties with the Jewish state, this is not the reason in most cases. Rather, it is solely due to a misconception that being from Israel could dissuade companies from doing business with them, in part due to a perception of the dangers posed by the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement. However, this reason is unfounded, Landau explained, adding that the BDS movement is far less effective than is believed.
 "There is this assumption that BDS has more impact than it actually does. It was never actually that successful," she said. "In our study, only 7% of businesspeople said they wouldn't do business with Israel. This is no reason to abandon the country of origin effect. When you buy, for example, a car from Germany or Sweden, you know the reputation the car has for safety, fuel efficiency, etc. But what do you know when buying an Israeli product? Nothing, because we don't tell people we're making them."
 It is for this reason that Vibe is trying to work with the government, Israeli businesses and investors to help change the country's marketing particularly as it's being used more successfully by other nations. and in the wake of the ongoing financial crisis caused by the coronavirus pandemic, now it's more important than ever before, especially since the country gained considerable good will amid the first wave that hadn't disappeared when the second wave hit.
 "Businesspeople still thought we handled the crisis well. For every one regular person who said the opposite, five businessmen thought otherwise," Landau explained.
 But what does work in Israel's favor is the recent normalizing of ties between Israel and arab nations, such as the UAE. While some have pointed out that many Arabs in, for example, the UAE and Saudi Arabia were attracted to the technological and entrepreneurial potential of normalized ties, Landau believes there is more nuance to this.
 "When we look at places like the UAE and Saudi Arabia, they can have enough money to buy any technology in the world," she explained. Rather, "They're drawn to Israel as a place and the Israeli people as a people. There's a sort of underlying brotherhood many people are ignoring. They Saudis and Emiratis are inspired by us and the mindset of getting things done. It's very appealing, and that's why they want to come."
 This, Landau said, "is the missing piece. It's a huge opportunity, but we can't use the same messaging we used in the past. We need a fresh, new perspective with new formal allies. It's up to the Israeli people and government to reevaluate the country's marketing. No country should keep using the same slogan after ten years in the middle of a major crisis."

It's been over four years since the Israel Air Force announced it would be replacing its aging CH-53 Yasur helicopters, and though there are two frontrunners there has been little movement on the purchase.
 With the IAF's CH-53 Yasur helicopters nearing the age of 50 - several crashed in the past year - its replacement is the most pressing matter for the air force. According to sources, the air force and general staff are well aware of the need to choose a replacement for the Ya'sur.
 First used by the IAF in 1969, the Yasur is the air force's primary helicopter used to transport soldiers and equipment and have taken part in a wide variety of missions, including secret operations as well as search and rescue missions.
 While the helicopters have been upgraded with new electronic and missile defense systems, the IAF still needs to replace them by 2025.
 No one expected the CH-53 to fly for so long.
 Last year the State Comptroller report recommended that the IAF replacing the aging aircraft as soon as possible as "prolonging the life of the Yasur is liable to endanger human life and may have significant operational implications and substantial maintenance costs."
 The air force should "consider purchasing the Ya'sur replacement option early so that it will be as close as possible to the date on which the memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the United States is implemented," the report added.
 The report was timely since over the past year there have been several serious accidents involving the Ya'sur, including one which saw the complete destruction of an aircraft after its engine caught on fire while en route to a training exercise in southern Israel.
 And facing a severe shortage of spare parts, earlier this year the Defense Ministry procured five surplus US Navy CH-53s to cannibalize and be used as spare parts for Israel's fleet of Ya'surs. But it's not enough.
 The IAF plans to procure some 20 new heavy-lift helicopters - in other words, one squadron - to replace the current Ya'sur squadron at the Tel Nof Base. The two options in the running are Lockheed Martin Sikorsky's CH-53K King Stallion, a completely redesigned version of the Ya'sur, and Boeing's CH-47F Chinook helicopter.
 IAF pilots and technician teams have flown both possible replacements and have prepared comprehensive reports of their capabilities, projected availability, and life cycle costs. Sources have even told The Jerusalem Post that the IAF knows what platform it wants, and has known for several years.
 So what's the hold-up?
 According to Maj.-Gen. (ret.) Yaakov Ayish, senior vice president for Israeli Affairs at the Jewish Institute for National Security of America (JINSA), though Israel's defense ministry and the military have had over four years to decide on "what platform they want, how many of them, and the sequence" in which to integrate them into the IAF, they want a general approval that will portray a framework that they can work with for the coming years and then come up with the platform they want."
 Former Air Force head and current Director-General of the Defense Ministry, Maj.-Gen. (ret.) Amir Eshel, who was essential in the decision-making process and procurement of the F-35, is now "trying to push it forward and execute the procurement deals," Ayish said.
 The IAF is also once again looking at procuring Bell Boeing's V-22 Osprey as it believes that there is an operational need for between 12-14 aircraft which can take off and land like helicopters but fly like fixed-wing planes.
 The V-22s are designed for sensitive, extensive missions both during times of war and routine.
 According to a source familiar with the deals confirmed on Thursday that the V-22 Osprey tiltrotor aircraft is once again on the table and would possibly be part of the heavy-lift helicopter deal.
 The multirole combat aircraft uses tiltrotor technology, combining the vertical performance of helicopters (such as take-off and landings) with the speed, altitude, and range of fixed-wing planes, making them the ideal aircraft for sensitive missions as they don't need runways.
 The current Memorandum of Understanding is up in 2028 and sources have stressed the urgency to make the purchases "right now" before it's too late.
 And though the IAF is facing budgetary issues, like the rest of the country which is struggling to cope with the financial impact of the coronavirus pandemic, if the military and defense ministry don't sign one of the options in the near future it risks the lives of IDF troops.
 Is it really worth it? No. It's not.  

 So nu? Make a decision already. Sign a deal. Before it's too late.

 HONG KONG, Oct 27 (Reuters) - Former Liverpool and Real Madrid head coach Rafa Benitez has laid bare the difficulties foreign coaches face working in the Chinese Super League: a lack of understanding of the game among local players.
 Benitez saw his Dalian Pro side lose 2-0 to Tianjin Teda in the first leg of a playoff on Monday evening, and the Spaniard was left frustrated at not being able to influence the outcome as he would if he were coaching in Europe or elsewhere.
 "When you work with a team in Europe it's totally different to when you work with a team in China," he said.
 "In Europe, the understanding of the game is different and here it is more difficult... So it's not what you want to do or what you can do - it's what your players can do."
 Benitez is one of numerous high-profile coaches brought in by Chinese clubs over the last decade to help lift the standard of the game in a country desperate to establish itself as a player on the global scene.
 But while China's economy has improved remarkably over the last three decades and the nation's international profile has increased significantly in other areas, in football China remains a minor player.
 It has only once qualified for the World Cup finals, in 2002, although club teams have had success on the regional level, with Guangzhou Evergrande twice winning the Asian Champions League in the last seven years.
 The first of those successes came under Italian World Cup winner Marcello Lippi in 2013 while Luiz Felipe Scolari, another man to have won the game's most famous trophy when he led his native Brazil to the 2002 title, steered the club to the title two years later.
 Chinese teams, though, often rely heavily on highly paid foreign stars or, increasingly, on naturalised players who have played in the Chinese Super League for five years and have acquired citizenship.
 The quality of locally developed players remains low, however, especially outside the leading three or four teams who have stockpiled the best talent from a shallow pool.
 That lack of excellence is further highlighted by the small number of Chinese players currently plying their trade in leagues outside the country, with only international striker Wu Lei, presently on the books of Espanyol in Spain's second division, worthy of note.
 For Benitez, who was hired on a contract worth a reported £12m per year, the frustration at seeing his side struggle through a lack of tactical and technical ability is significant.
 Backed by the wealthy and influential Wanda corporation, Dalian have the financial resources to be a major player in Chinese football. But Benitez and his team are locked in a battle that will see them finish no higher than ninth in this year's standings.
 They will take on Tianjin in the second leg of their playoff on Saturday needing to overturn that two-goal deficit if they are to harbour any hopes of finishing as high as possible in the COVID-19 affected table.
 "I suppose that we will have a chance for sure," said Benitez of the impending second leg.
 "But it will not be easy because the other team was doing well." (Reporting by Michael Church; Editing by Hugh Lawson)

Oct 27 (Reuters) - Billionaire Michael Bloomberg is planning to spend around $15 million to help Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden defeat President Donald in Texas and Ohio during the final week of the campaign, the New York Times reported on Tuesday, citing a senior Bloomberg aide.
 Bloomberg, the former New York City mayor who lost to Biden in a crowded field for the Democratic nomination, has vowed to spend up to $100 million of his personal fortune to support Biden's campaign for the Nov. 3 election.
 Bloomberg has been targeting Florida as a state he could push into the Biden column and on Monday he agreed to add Texas and Ohio for a late television advertising blitz, after his team presented polling data showing them as competitive, the Times said.
 He will also increase pro-Biden advertising in Florida, the report said.
 "We believe that Florida will go down to the wire, and we were looking for additional opportunities to expand the map," Bloomberg aide Howard Wolfson told the Times. "Texas and Ohio present the best opportunities to do that, in our view."
 Wolfson and the Bloomberg team did not immediately respond to a Reuters request to confirm the report.
 Trump won Texas and Ohio in his 2016 election, and holding on to both states is crucial to his re-election prospects. As the second and seventh most populous states, both are prizes in the state-by-state contests that decide the presidential race.
 Trump had been favored in both at the start of the campaign. Neither state has been bombarded with the kind of television advertising that has dominated other closely divided states, potentially making a late spending campaign effective, the Times said.
 Bloomberg is directing his political spending through his super PAC, Independence USA, the Times said. (Reporting by Daniel Trotta Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)

 ABOVYAN, Armenia, Oct 27 (Reuters) - In a factory where diamonds are cut, Anna Osipyan and her two grandchildren found something even more precious after fleeing their homes in the mountainous enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh: shelter from the region's worst fighting in almost 30 years.
 With nearly 200 others, many of them children, Osipyan has camped for a month inside the modern plant on the edge of the Armenian capital, Yerevan. On a tip from a friend, she arrived by car while her younger male relatives stayed behind to fight.
 "This is our third war," said the 56-year-old resident of Stepanakert, the largest city in Nagorno-Karabakh. "We have become used to it."
 Conflict reignited on Sept. 27 in Nagorno-Karabakh, a part of Azerbaijan populated and controlled by ethnic Armenians. Hundreds have been killed and clashes have blown through three ceasefires.
 Hours after the first shells hit, privately owned ADM Diamonds sent a bus to evacuate people from the conflict zone. At its factory 20 km (12 miles) from Yerevan, it replaced desks where precious stones are cut with dozens of makeshift beds.
 "When there is a war, we can't talk about profit," company director Arsen Artashesyan told Reuters in the factory's backyard. "We've turned this into a place where Karabakh refugees will live. Some people here don't have homes any more."
 Diamond-cutting is a major industry in Armenia. ADM generates about $35-40 million in annual sales and its factory in the town of Abovyan, opened three years ago and powered in part by solar panels on its roof, is the largest in the country.
 Artashesyan said the company, which postponed an expansion into sapphires, rubies and topaz to make room for the refugees, would consider launching another, smaller factory inside Nagorno-Karabakh after the war. To this end, he said, it would soon begin training some of the refugees in cutting gemstones.
 Armenians regard Nagorno-Karabakh as part of their historic homeland while Azeris consider the region to be illegally occupied land that must be returned to their control. About 30,000 people were killed in the 1991-94 war.
 Osipyan's husband was among the dead, killed, she said, by an Azeri shell in 1994. Before leaving Stepanakert, she hid for two days in her basement as the city once more came under fire.
 "It would protect us from shrapnel, more or less, but if the house had been hit directly, it would have been over," she said.
 In the diamond factory, she sleeps in the same bed as her granddaughter, 17, and 11-year-old grandson. Her daughter, the children's mother, isn't with them - she was taken to hospital after contracting COVID-19 shortly after leaving home.

Recasts paragraph 1)
 By Bhargav Acharya
 Oct 27 (Reuters) - London-based Genius Sports Group Ltd said on Tuesday it would go public through a merger with New York-listed special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) dMY Technology Group Inc II, joining the bandwagon of firms accessing markets via SPAC deals.
 Genius Sports, which acquires data from sports events and supplies it to sports betting operators, said the deal, which is valued at about $1.5 billion including debt, is expected to close in Q1 2021.
 The company maintains partnerships with over 500 sports organisations globally, including the NBA, NCAA, FIBA, FIFA, English Premier League and NASCAR.
 "We chose a SPAC deal to help us list quickly and minimise distractions to the daily running of the business," CEO Mark Locke said in a phone interview, when asked why the company chose not to pursue a traditional IPO.
 Merging with a SPAC, an alternative to going public in a traditional initial public offering, involves less regulatory scrutiny and more certainty over the market valuation and funds raised.
 SPACs have been behind some of the most high-profile public listings over the past year, including online betting firm DraftKings and billionaire investor Richard Branson's space tourism firm Virgin Galactic Holdings Inc.
 dMY, which the Genius Sports called a "natural partner", went public in August after raising $240 million from its IPO and has already bought Chicago-based online gambling company Rush Street Interactive LP.
 The boards of both the companies have unanimously approved the transaction, the company said, adding that Locke will be CEO of the new merged entity.
 The new company is expected to trade its ordinary shares on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "GENI" upon closing of the deal, it said. (Reporting by Yadarisa Shabong and Bhargav Acharya in Bengaluru; editing by Rashmi Aich and Jason Neely)

Bloomberg) -- Recruiting software startup Eightfold AI said it was valued at $1 billion in a $125 million financing round led by General Catalyst.
 Existing investors Capital One Ventures, Lightspeed Venture Partners, IVP and Foundation Capital also participated in the round, according to Eightfold. The company has now raised $180 million, dating back to 2016.
 Eightfold’s software helps companies with all aspects of talent management, from recruiting to employee retention. Its corporate clients include Bayer AG, Capital One Financial Corp. and Micron Technology Inc.
 General Catalyst invested partly because Eightfold has seen its business grow during the coronavirus pandemic, said Quentin Clark, managing director at the venture firm.
 “It is very telling that at this time, their customer base is exploding,” Clark said. He expects the startup could go public someday, he added.
 Eightfold’s platform is designed to help clients diversify their workforce by reducing unconscious bias in the hiring process.
 “All of us saw what happened with social unrest over the last few months,” said Eightfold Chief Executive Officer Ashutosh Garg. “We can’t just keep talking about it, we have to solve diversity.”
 Overall, it has been a challenging year for recruiting, Garg said. While some industries such as tourism have struggled, others including gaming and health care have done well, he said.
 Asked whether an IPO is a long-term goal for the Mountain View, California- based company, Garg replied, “Of course.”

Bloomberg) -- Citigroup Inc. plans to deepen its corporate banking presence in developing countries from Russia to South Africa even as some rivals decamp to focus on their home markets.
 Citigroup has overhauled its business in eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa to focus on emerging economies. The third-largest U.S. bank is betting unprecedented deal opportunities will follow the economic slump caused by the coronavirus pandemic, weak oil prices and political uncertainty.
 As part of the revamp, Citigroup in September shifted 29 of its operations across these three regions and added another 30 units in countries where it didn’t have a presence, creating a single emerging markets cluster.
 “We’re going to look at increasing the canvas for the bank compared to where we are now,” Naveed Kamal, chairman of EMEA EM corporate banking, said in an interview.
 The expansion contrasts with some of its European rivals. Deutsche Bank AG and Barclays Plc have scaled back or retreated from Africa to focus on their home markets. Standard Chartered Plc is cutting staff and reducing its presence in Dubai, along with Nomura Holdings Inc. and Credit Suisse Group AG.
 “We’re already hiring new resources and will hire more people as the opportunity grows,” Kamal said. “It will be a combination of either hiring more or reallocating resources.”
 Bigger Buckets
 Demand for emerging-market assets will increase substantially as global asset managers and pension funds look to generate higher returns in the low interest-rate environment, Rizwan Shaikh, co-head of Citigroup’s EMEA EM corporate-banking division, said on the same call.
 Direct lending platforms set up by sovereign wealth funds like Mubadala and Qatar Investment Authority are further opportunities for the New York-based bank and its competitors.
 The lender’s emerging-markets business could get a further boost when Jane Fraser takes over as chief executive officer in February given her experience in some developing regions.
 “We’re excited about the entire region especially in light of the last seven to eight months,” said Aziz Rahman, co-head of EMEA EM corporate banking. “We see a common thread in EM from companies and sovereigns who are either looking to raise capital, do refinancing, and/or do more acquisitions and grow.”
 The bank expects sovereigns to keep tapping markets for their capital needs, with bond and sukuk sales from the Middle East and North Africa hitting a record $115 billion so far this year.
 Fiscal Space
 “These countries have significant sovereign wealth and fiscal space to borrow for investing in their economies for growth and to fund deficits,” Kamal said.
 The bank is the third top arranger of debt and sukuk sales from the Middle East and North Africa, behind HSBC Holdings Plc and Standard Chartered, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It ranks third for Eastern European bonds after JPMorgan and BNP Paribas SA, and fourth in Africa.
 To complement the bond-sale spree, state-owned firms are also turning to asset sales to support their economies.
 Citigroup Sees Asset Sales Boosting $47 Billion Gulf Debt Binge
 While Citigroup isn’t expecting a big rush for liquidity from regional clients any time soon -- mainly because of quarterly earnings that either met or beat expectations -- this is poised to change.
 “There will be need for capital as things normalize and our clients look to reinvest for growth,” Shaikh said. “Most have held back spending in the past months and we expect pent up demand to drive a lot of capital raising in debt and equity.”

Senzo Meyiwa's Murder Case Hits Rock Bottom In Court After Accused Reveal They…


--DocBreak--
Bloomberg Opinion) -- The Covid-19 pandemic will eventually subside, but the economic hangover from the recession it brought will be long and painful. As calls grow for government to step up and spend money in order to get the economy back on its feet, deficit hawks already are raising their voices in response. Hastening the post-Covid recovery will require overcoming the doctrine of austerity, which did so much to hurt the U.S. and other countries during the last recession.
 When the financial crisis led to the Great Recession back in 2008, the idea of fiscal austerity was quick to rear its head. A number of prominent right- leaning economists disparaged the notion that government spending could ameliorate the downturn. Some even argued that cutting spending would expand the economy, by increasing confidence in the government’s solvency. Others warned that too much government debt would slow down economic growth.
 Ultimately, pro-austerity arguments helped to limit the size of President Barack Obama’s fiscal stimulus, and found an even more receptive audience in some parts of Europe. Austerity -- helped by the activism of conservative Tea Party Republicans -- won the day, and most of the deficit spending initiated in the early years of the Great Recession was reversed.
 The idea of austerity is attractive for several reasons. Many people tend to think of the government as being like a household; a government that borrows to spend is seen as irresponsible. What’s more, conservatives often fear that emergency government spending will become permanent when a recession is over, thus ratcheting up the size of government. Economists who watched crises in emerging markets were long accustomed to recommending that these countries strengthen their fiscal position in order to gain the confidence of fickle international capital. And cynical politicians may invoke austerity in order to prevent a president from the opposing party from giving the economy a boost.
 But the U.S. must avoid the siren song of austerity this time around. Theory and evidence both come down strongly against cutting spending in a downturn. And although government borrowing can be bad in some situations, now is not one of those times.
 As it turns out, the notion that reducing government spending can stimulate the economy doesn’t have much empirical support. A team of International Monetary Fund economists reexamined the idea in 2011, measuring changes in fiscal policy by looking at direct evidence from government speeches and internal documents. They found that government spending cuts tend to reduce private investment and depress economic activity. The research showing otherwise, they argue, had made a mistake by confusing natural economic forces with changes in government policy.
 Meanwhile, the minority of economists who pooh-poohed fiscal stimulus didn’t have much of a leg to stand on. The theoretical justification for spending to boost the economy -- especially in a deep recession, when interest rates can’t be cut past zero -- is as solid as macroeconomic theory ever gets. What’s more, a slew of empirical analyses since 2008 almost all show the effectiveness of fiscal stimulus during recessions. The respected macroeconomist Robert Hall concluded that Obama’s stimulus, modest and short- lived as it was, still managed to cushion about one-fifth of the blow of the Great Recession. Meanwhile, European countries that indulged in austerity performed generally worse than others.
 The reason, of course, is that the government isn’t like a household. Though some governments borrow mainly from foreign countries, the U.S. borrows mainly from U.S. bond investors. Since most federal debt is money the U.S. owes to itself, it’s not really being spendthrift when it borrows. The main question is whether private bond investors will continue to finance the U.S. deficit. So far, persistently low interest rates show that they’re perfectly willing to do so.
 If interest rates someday rise, the Federal Reserve might have to increase the money supply in order to push them back down, which might create inflation. But the lack of inflation -- even in countries with far more government debt than the U.S. -- means that this point is still probably far off.
 What’s more, when the government spends, it often benefits society even if it doesn’t make its money back. Investments in scientific research, infrastructure and education can produce big dividends for the private sector, even though the increased tax revenue might not be enough to pay for the spending. In this case, the debt is always worth it.
 So austerity is a false prophet -- at least, during recessions. But false prophets have real power, and this one is already doing some damage. When Congress’ concern over deficits caused special unemployment benefits to lapse, millions of Americans fell into poverty. That's certain to hurt the economy going forward. Meanwhile, a Joe Biden victory in the upcoming presidential election might cause Republicans to dig in their heels against further government action, as they did during the Obama administration. The result would be a human and economic tragedy.
 Austerity has its place -- but in good times, not during recessions. Until the Covid-induced downturn is firmly in the rearview mirror, the U.S. government shouldn’t be afraid to spend.
