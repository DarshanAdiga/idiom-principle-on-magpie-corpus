It's wedding time on _90 Day Fianc e_. In the Sunday, Jan. 26 episode of the hit TLC reality series, two couples tied the knot, while others, well, they fought. Anny was offered a blank check from Bryson's grandmother, Mursel made a splashy return and Mike wondered what he should do about Natalie. Let's break it down, with the most dramatic first: Robert and Anny.
 After their brewery blowout, Robert knew he was wrong and apologized to Anny by way of some red pumps. When she asked how much they were, he told her it didn't matter. That's the answer she wanted to hear after all those squabbles about money. Robert told Anny he was out of line and his goal is to make her happy. If that's his goal, perhaps he should've given it a second thought when he agreed to go to brunch with Ben and Stephanie, Bryson's grandparents.

A 93-year-old woman is "perfectly entitled" to continue residing at her family home regardless of a judgment for €779,000 against her son who owns the property, the High Court ruled. Ms Justice Teresa Pilkington said any failure to properly provide for Eithne Ryan's right to support and maintenance "lies squarely" with her son Bryan Ryan who owns the house and attached 135 acre farm over which there is a debt of €1.4m to Bank of Ireland (BoI). She was giving judgment in a case brought by Mrs Ryan against BoI seeking orders in relation to her right of residence and support arising out of a will made by her late husband Laurence Ryan in which he left the family home and farm at Bunker Hill, Cratloe, Co Clare, to Bryan. He left €20,000 to his wife and said she would have a right of residence and support in Bunker Hill for life. The bank had argued that with a debt of €1.4m it was not beyond the bounds of possibility that the €779,000 debt to the mother, which was the valuation of her right of residence/support, would be utilised to cancel the bank's ability to recover the debt. Mrs Ryan had sought a declaration that her right of residence and support ranked as a first charge in priority to the bank's charge over the property. The bank brought a counterclaim against both Mrs Ryan and Bryan seeking a declaration that her right of residence only related to the house and not the farm. It also argued any charge in her favour did not take priority over its registered burden on the property. Ms Justice Pilkington said before bringing the proceedings seeking a declaration in relation to residence, Mrs Ryan, in 2015, sued Bryan requiring him to support and maintain her in Bunker Hill in accordance with her husband's will. She also sought an order requiring Bryan to carry out all necessary works or repairs on the houses. Bryan did not contest his mother's proceedings saying through his lawyers he did not "wish to drag a family dispute involving his mother before the courts especially where he has no obvious grounds to defend same." In 2016, the court gave judgment in favour of Mrs Ryan against Bryan for €779,225, which included valuing her right of residence and support at €428,000, €281,000 for repairs to the house and another €60,000 specifically for repairing the roof. Ms Justice Pilkington said it did not appear any steps were taken by Mrs Ryan to enforce that judgment. Mrs Ryan, who the judge described as "an impressive lady and well able to keep up with her activities at that time", had made it perfectly clear she had no intention of moving out of the house although she did not give evidence. Later, the court granted an application that solicitor Gerard Reidy should act as as Mrs Ryan's court- appointed guardian. Ms Justice Pilkington found her right of residence takes priority in relation to any burdens on the property in favour of the bank. It is a matter for those acting for Mrs Ryan as to how they wish to seek to enforce the €779,000 judgment against her son, she said. It was forcibly argued on behalf of the bank that her right of residence proceedings was "part of a strategy" designed to affect the ability of bank to recover monies on foot of the charge it has on the property, she said. This was "not a matter for this court" but she was entitled to reside in Bunker Hill and responsibility for it lay squarely with her son, she said. She was satisfied the burden on the property in Mrs Ryan's favour extends only to the house. There was, therefore, no necessity for the court to consider the bank's application regarding the rectification of the registering of that burden, she said.

PUNE After ending Vincent's winning streak in the Loyola Cup earlier this month, Loyola High School defeated St. Vincent's 'A' in their own backyard at the inaugural St Vincent's Junior (U-12) League Inter-School Football Tournament on Saturday. The tournament is currently in the group- stage phase, with matches scheduled on Saturdays. After the completion of the group stage, the knock-out phase will confirm the two finalists. The hosts, with a primary aim to promote football at the grassroots level, have fielded two teams in this tournament, while the other teams include Loyola High School, Vidya Bhavan High School, Vidya Valley, Kalyani School, Hutchings High School, Orbis School, St Arnold's School, and Vidyankur School.Matchday one was bittersweet for Loyola and Vidyankur School, after both registered a win and a loss on the same day. Loyola shocked St Vincent's 'A' as Kabir Kadam and Arhan Shaikh were on target for the visitors. However, in the next game, against St. Vincent's 'B', Shushrut Shukla scored the only goal of the game to beat Loyola.Vidyankur School lost their opening game against Kalyani School. Tanmay Kumar and Arnav Meshram were on target for Kalyani, while Saksham Bitke could only nab a consolation goal for his side. Later on in the day, Vidyankur finally got off the mark as they defeated the hosts' 'A' team 2-1, handing St. Vincent's 'A' two defeats in two games on the opening day. Bitke was on target again for the visitors and a Vincent's own goal handed Vidyankur their first victory.Vidya Valley drew both their opening games of the day. A scoreless draw against Hutchings and a 2-2 draw against Orbis School added just twwo points to their kitty. St Arnold's School also jumped on the bandwagon with 1-1 draw against Kalyani School. Earlier St Arnold's thrashed Orbis 4-0, as Jonathan Jaji netted a brace.

(AP) – Countries with citizens in the central Chinese city that’s the epicenter of a viral outbreak are planning evacuations as the number of illnesses grow and China takes drastic measures to try to stop the spread of the virus.China has cut transportation in several cities in Hubei province and is requiring some travelers to quarantine themselves.France, Japan and the United States are trying to arrange charter flights to help citizens leave Wuhan, the city where the outbreak began last month.Authorities in China reported 2,744 people sickened and 81 killed by the new coronavirus.There are five confirmed cases of the virus in the United States. Two are in Southern California, and one each are in Washington state, Chicago and Arizona.China has expanded sweeping efforts to contain the viral disease by postponing the end of this week’s Lunar New Year holiday to keep the public at home and avoid spreading the virus.Mongolia closed its border with China, while Hong Kong and Malaysia announced they would bar entry to visitors from the mainland province at the center of the outbreak. Travel agencies were ordered to cancel group tours nationwide.Increasingly drastic anti-disease efforts began with the suspension last week of transport links to Wuhan, a city of 11 million people.That lockdown has expanded to a total of 17 cities in Hubei province with more than 50 million people in the most far-reaching disease-control measures ever imposed.With tens of millions of Chinese ordered to stay put and many others opting to avoid travel as the new coronavirus spreads, the travel sector around the globe is taking a heavy hit during the Lunar New Year, one of the biggest holiday seasons.In Thailand, a favorite tropical destination for Lunar New Year travel, officials estimate potential lost revenue at 50 billion baht ($1.6 billion).In Asia and much farther away, hotels, airlines, cruise operators and others who depend on big spending Chinese tourists are ruing their absence.Tourism from China was already weakening even before the new virus forced much of the country into a standstill.Shares have tumbled in early European trading after a bleak session in Asia as China announced sharp increases in the number of people affected by an outbreak of the potentially deadly virus.In Paris, the CAC 40 dropped 1.9% while Germany’s DAX sank 1.8%.Many Asian markets were closed Monday for Lunar New Year holidays, but Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 index sank 2%, while the benchmark in Thailand dropped 2.9%.Copyright 2020 Associated Press.

Poi, parlando del suo amico intimo Carlo Verdone, ha confessato di essersi avvicinato a lui a scuola e di avergli chiesto di sedersi al suo fianco. "Se mi fai sedere accanto a te ti passo le versioni di greco gia tradotte". Un altro aneddoto dunque davvero suggestivo, che non aveva mai raccontato. Qualche mese fa, a 'Domenica In', aveva fatto riferimento al suo grande dolore: "Mio fratello mi manca, ma la perdita piu dolorosa e stata quella di mia madre. Sono fortunato perche mio padre lo vedo ovunque, nei film o nei video televisivi. Di mia madre ho solo fotografie". Ora per lui e tempo pero di godersi ancora i successi personali. L'ospitata al Festival di Sanremo rappresentera sicuramente un altro punto importante della sua stratosferica carriera.

Until 2018, Mauser worked at Harbor Day School, where she and her husband coached the eighth-grade girls’ basketball team to their first  championship, according to the school’s magazine.                     Mauser “put her heart and soul” into teaching physical education at the school, where she had worked for 11 years, the magazine said. During her time there, she reformed the physical education curriculum to include yoga and Pilates.                     Dave White, the former longtime football coach at Edison High in Huntington Beach, said he coached Mauser on the basketball team. The 1999 Edison graduate went by Christina Patterson back then.                     “Great player, better person,” White said. “I am heartbroken.”                     _-- David Carrillo and Laura J.

Altobelli and his wife, Keri, were on board the helicopter with their daughter Alyssa, who played on the same club team as Gianna Bryant.                      Altobelli was the longest-tenured baseball coach in Orange Coast College history. He guided the Pirates to four California state community college championships and more than 700 victories in his 27 years at the school.                     “Alto was one of the best men I’ve ever met,” said Nate Johnson, the team’s associate head coach, addressing family members and friends at the school’s baseball field on Sunday. “If your son played for him, he treated him like a son. If you coached for him, he treated you like a brother. If you worked for him, you were part of his family.”                     Johnson said that Altobelli had grown close to Bryant and had flown in Bryant’s helicopter several times.                     Altobelli, who lived in Newport Beach, helped hundreds of players earn scholarships to Division I programs over the past three decades. The American Baseball Coaches Assn. named him the national coach of the year in 2019.                     A standout outfielder at Newport Harbor High School and Golden West College, Altobelli was a two-year starter at the University of Houston and played one season of minor league baseball in the Florida Marlins’ system.                     “I get the credit for a lot of things, but it’s a team effort, and we all pull the rope in the same direction,” Altobelli told the Daily Pilot after his 600th career victory in 2017. “And that’s what this program is all about.”                     _-- Mike DiGiovanna_                  *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange
