He said Guterres held telephone calls with several other stakeholders concerned with the issue in Guerguerat and in the buffer zone.
 The conversation between Morocco’s monarch and the UN secretary-general focused on the Guerguerat crisis.
 “And as you know, in recent days, [the UN] has been very much involved in multiple initiatives to avoid an escalation of the situation and to warn against violations of the ceasefire and serious consequences to the status quo,” he said.
 On November 16, King Mohammed VI vowed that Morocco will continue to take the necessary measures to ensure order and the safe movement of people and goods in the buffer zone.
 The monarch reaffirmed Morocco’s commitment to the ceasefire agreement, which the Polisario Front breached.
 “The Kingdom remains firmly determined to react, with the greatest severity, and within the framework of self-defense, against any threat to its security and the peace of mind of its citizens,” the King said.
 The Royal Armed Forces (FAR) announced that the Polisario Front opened fire against Morocco’s military when they moved to secure Guerguerat.
 Morocco kept its actions in Guerguerat peaceful and non-offensive but the Polisario Front escalated tensions in the region, forcing the army to respond firmly.
 The army neutralized hostile attacks from the Polisario militiamen along the Moroccan defense line in Mahbes, a UN-restricted area near the Algerian border.

For all of their differences, there's one thing the Kardashian-Jenner sisters have in common - they love to share hairstyles and makeup looks.
 Particularly when it comes to hairstyles, it seems the group are always either A) racing to get to the season's most popular colour, cut and/or style or B) guinea-pigging styles for one another to try at a later date.
 The latest? It seems that after dabbling in Rapunzel vibes, a natural cropped bob and a Kris Jenner-inspired pixie crop, mogul Kylie Jenner chose to settle on a Lara Croft inspired, strawberry blonde, extra-long plait for the launch of her Grinch collection.
 And, like clockwork, big sis Kim Kardashian today posted an instagram grid shot celebrating the launch of her Crystalized KKW Beauty with - you guessed it - a super XL glossy pony-plait.  
 Here's what she had to say about the collection itself:   _   "I wanted our holiday collection this year to be perfect for both gifting and personal use, so we included compact powders and new mini lip sets. During the holidays, I love to have more fun with my looks, so our eyeshadow palette and the blush duos have both matte and shimmer shades in an array of versatile and complementary colors. There are so many different ways to wear this collection and I can 't wait to see what looks our customers will create with it! Shop the #Crystallized Collection on Wednesday, 11.25 at 12PM PT only at KKWBEAUTY.COM"      _Ok, so on closer inspection, Kim's opted to twist her lengths, rather than plaiting them, for the shoot. But... the resemblance is uncanny, no? __  
 Here's Kylie's version, posted 2 days ago.

KOZHIKODE: The Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) and the Opposition United Democratic Front (UDF) may cry foul at the arrest of their leader and former Public Works Minister V.K. Ebrahim Kunju over the Palarivattom flyover scam being probed by the Vigilance and Anti-Corruption Bureau (VACB). In the run-up to the local body elections in the State, however, the IUML, as also the UDF, has much to worry about the discomfiture over the fact that two of its three MLAs facing probes into serious charges, including corruption and cheating, are now under arrest.
 The timing of the arrest of Mr. Kunju, who represents the Kalamassery constituency in Ernakulam, may lend credence to the UDF’s allegation that it was an act of vendetta by the Left Democratic Front (LDF) led by the Communist Party of India (Marxist) to eclipse its own embarrassment over the fallout of the ongoing investigations by Central agencies into the diplomatic channel gold smuggling and LIFE Mission scams.
 ## Kamaruddin’s case
 But the latest arrest adds to the woes of the IUML as it comes close on the heels of the arrest of party leader and Manjeswaram MLA M.C. Kamaruddin by the Crime Branch in connection with a Fashion Gold jewellery investment scam and the questioning of party’s young leader and Azhikode MLA K.M. Shaji in a bribery case for sanctioning Plus Two courses for an aided school at Azhikode in Kannur district. Mr. Shaji is also facing a probe into the allegation that he amassed wealth disproportionate to his known sources of income.
 Outwardly, the IUML and UDF leadership puts on a brave front and dubs the cases against three as a ploy by the LDF government to turn the tables on the Opposition to divert public attention from the adverse political impact of the investigations in the case of gold smuggling through diplomatic baggage and its domino effect. But IUML and UDF circles privately admit that the they are facing a major challenge now that the ruling and Opposition parties are girding up their loins for what is set to be a tempestuous election campaign.
 With two of its MLAs under arrest and another under investigation by the Enforcement Directorate and the VACB, the IUML, which has a strong support base in Malabar, will find itself in a tight spot on the campaign front.

BY Okey Alozie   The Manner at which the Arch Bishop of Owerri Catholic Diocese, Most Rev A.J.V Obinna was insulted at the requiem Mass of Late Hon Justice Christiana Anwuka, recently at the Holy Trinity Catholic Parish Egbuma Oguta LGA has been Condemned by Majority of Imolites especially Catholics.   Our Reporter gathered that the Eldest Son of Prof Anthony Anwuka who happened to be Senator Okorocha's In-law was the one who committed the sacrilege.   Trumpeta was told that the disgraceful act by Anwuka’s son took place when Dr Uzoma Anwuka, the Son in-law of Owelle Rochas Okorocha former Governor of Imo State was called upon to pay last respect to his dear mother who was to be committed to the Mother Earth immediately after the Mass Service. Dr Anwuka from what Trumpeta learnt failed to observe protocols by not recognizing Arch Bishop Obinna and his Entourage.   The worst Scenario was when the Deputy Governor was called up to address the people without the permission of the Arch Bishop who felt humiliated. This particular act as we gathered made the Catholics in Owerri to raise eyebrows.   Those who spoke to us blasted Okorocha's son in-law for insulting the Man of God, they therefore demanded that Dr Uzoma Anwuka should as a matter of urgency consider it necessary to apologize to the Arch Bishop.

He didn’t keep wickets though and the extent of recovery couldn’t be ascertained from the video uploaded by the BCCI media.
 There wasn’t any pronounced forward press or footwork involved while driving the half-volleys, which could be an indicator of how quickly his hamstring is healing.
 However, the man who has so far played 37 Tests and scored 1238 runs for the country, didn’t look uncomfortable during his time at the nets.
 From the video it seemed that both the throwdown specialists didn’t go full tilt at the batsman, who is trying to gradually get into the groove after the injury.
 BCCI president Sourav Ganguly recently expressed confidence that Saha would be fully fit before the first Test with both Nitin Patel and Nick Webb working on his injury management.
 During the last Test series in New Zealand, Saha was confined to the sidelines with Rishabh Pant getting an opportunity for his superior batting skills. However, this time around Pant’s dreadful batting form in the IPL has not helped his cause.
 In case Saha fully recovers, he will be the favourite to don the big gloves in the four-match series.

It hasn’t been the typical offseason and preseason to say the least with the extra precautions in place due to Covid-19. The team has been placed in a bit of a bubble as far as where they can go and who they can be around, and while it has been a challenge and added responsibility, Devoe said the team is making the sacrifices they need to in order to be able to play this season, something they didn’t know for sure was going to be an option a few months ago.
 “It’s been something to get adjusted to as far as after practices or before practices, the main thing is staying on top of schoolwork and then after practices, just staying at our place,” said Devoe. “We live across the street. As far as that, just staying away from people, staying in the gym, staying focused, staying prepared, like I said before, our main thing is we want to play. We’re getting the ability to be able to play this year so we’re looking forward to that, and we just have to stay on top of things. So as far as that, we just stay distanced from a lot of people, stay with our core that we have and stick with it. It definitely takes discipline. Just staying focused on what our goal is this year, doing stuff like that to not be able to get set back, just staying away from things like that.”
 The finish line of the preseason (and the start of the regular season) is in sight, and Devoe said he and the team are chomping at the bit to get on the court after all the hard work and sacrifice they have put in for what will likely be a different kind of year in 2020-21.
 “We’re more than ready,” said Devoe. “Right now it’s going to be a crazy season this year due to Covid and all this type of stuff we have going on, but we’re still locked in. We’re getting better every day, and we’re excited. We really want to play basketball. That’s the main thing for us this year. We really want to play so we’re excited and we’re more than ready.”

He was easy to talk to and checked some boxes, however within 24 hours of chatting, I remembered why I had wanted to delete the app and didn’t think his message was a sign. We were making small talk and he told me I should come over to his house. I told him I didn’t feel comfortable and he told me he could come get me. When I didn’t respond, he followed up with offering to send me an Uber. Seriously?! I’m not afraid to drive at night. I already have someone that is only interested in sex and don’t need another.

With two months left in office, President Trump is rushing to bring more US troops home from Afghanistan and Iraq. The withdrawal of thousands of troops would be completed by January 15 (just ahead of Biden's inauguration), leaving Afghanistan and Iraq with 2,500 troops each -- down from about 4,500 and 3,000, respectively, the acting defense secretary said. A senior defense official said the move is consistent with Trump's promise to the American people. But it also suggests the President may fall short of fulfilling one of his core pledges to withdraw all US troops from Afghanistan before he leaves office -- something he pledged as recently as October.

Suzuki Burgman electric scooter will lock horns with the Bajaj Chetak, Ather 450 and TVS iQube and offer comparable levels of performance Suzuki Motorcycle India had previously expressed its interest in participating in the electric scooter segment when the time is right, and it looks like things have finally started falling into place. A pair of Suzuki Burgman test mules were spotted testing in public road recently, and they seem to be lacking the exhaust canister. Suzuki Burgman electric scooter The Burgman with its imposing size, edgy styling and premium appeal makes for an interesting product for electrification. While the spy shots are not very clear, the black bulky element near the rear wheel hub is likely carrying the electric driving unit. Closer observation also reveals a shock abosorber on the right side (the IC engine variant employs a single-sided shock abosorber on the left side) to manage the extra bulk. Technical specifications are scarce as of now but expect Suzuki to equip its first electric scooter for India with a motor offering around 80 kmph of top speed and a lithium-ion battery pack good for a range of around 70-90 km. The Japanese brand is likely to push more a very high localization level for the electric powertrain to take advantage of the government subsidy and arrive at a competitive price point. Launch timeline The Suzuki Burgman electric test mules appear to be early prototypes to test the new components. We don't expect the final product to be ready for the market launch before 2022. The styling is likely to be retained but there could be a few design touches to highlight the upcoming EV's green credentials. The Suzuki Burgman's fully digital instrument console would be offering additional functions typical of an electric scooter. Going by the industry trend, it is reasonable to expect the EV to offer a range of connected features including a comprehensive smartphone app. Rivals The Suzuki Burgman electric scooter will be locking horns with other premium electric offerings in the country like the Bajaj Chetak, Ather 450 (and its successor), TVS iQube, and so on. It remains to be seen if Suzuki will make its upcoming product available across the country right from day one or resort to a phased launch campaign, starting with tier-I cities. The last few months after the lockdown has given the electric scooter market a new impetus as more and more people are embracing private mode of transport. These are exciting times for the nascent electric vehicle industry. Source

I had a couple girlfriends over for wine last weekend and we made an online dating profile for me. I let them choose my pictures and enter all my information as well as swipe left and right. As imagined, they were horrified by a lot of the options that came up. I find that married people that have never experienced online dating tend to believe it is better than it is. They hear one success story about their hairdresser’s second cousin and think that the man of my dreams is just one click away and waiting for me to say “Hello” on Bumble. If only it were that easy.
 We had some laughs, started a couple conversations, and agreed I could delete it as they were getting ready to leave. As luck would have it, Nolan reached out at the last second. I had deleted the pictures, unmatched with the select few we had engaged with, and was in the home stretch when a nice message from a seemingly normal person appeared. Of course, this was met with cheers of “It’s a sign!” from both of my friends.

In an ominous sign of how rapidly COVID-19 is spreading across Los Angeles County, officials on Tuesday warned that a new stay-at-home order would be imposed if coronavirus cases and hospitalizations continue to spike over the next few weeks.
 County leaders said they are desperately trying to avoid another shutdown, announcing that, starting Friday, they will begin ordering restaurants and nonessential stores to close at 10 p.m. and place a cap on the number of people allowed at outdoor gatherings — a maximum of 15 people from no more than three households — in hopes of slowing the infection rate.
 Los Angeles County has been particularly hard hit by the latest wave of the coronavirus. The average number of daily cases has tripled in the last month, from more than 900 cases a day to more than 2,800 for the five-day period that ended Tuesday, according to a Times analysis.
 The number of people hospitalized with COVID-19 has also surged in L.A. County by nearly 60% in the past month, from 752 infected people in hospitals on Oct. 16 to 1,188 on Monday. And the rate at which coronavirus tests results are coming back positive is substantially up, now at 5.3% over the past week, up from 3.8% the previous week.
