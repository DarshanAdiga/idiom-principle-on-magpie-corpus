Morocco intervened at the El Guergarat border post in the service of peace and to unblock an international route to ensure free civil and commercial movement, in accordance with international law and in perfect harmony with the needs of the region and the cease-fire agreement, said, on Thursday in Rabat, Head of Government Saâd Dine El Otmani, noting that the Kingdom's decision enabled a strategic change.
 El Otmani stressed that this week was filled with good news, starting with the securing of the El Guergarat crossing a few days before the celebration of Independence Day, said the Minister of national education, vocational training, higher education and scientific research, government spokesman Saaid Amzazi, in a statement read at a press briefing after the weekly cabinet meeting.
 The head of government welcomed the decision of HM King Mohammed VI to carry out an operation to restore the situation at the El Guergarat crossing and secure it against the separatist militias, noting that this operation was conducted with great professionalism by the Royal Armed Forces after a number of attempts by Morocco and its diplomacy and successive contacts with the UN Secretary General, the MINURSO forces and many members of the Security Council as well as other countries to restore the situation.
 Amzazi noted that the head of government recalled that the blocking of the crossing and the route of El Guergarat was the subject of a resolution of the Security Council in which it called on the separatist militias to withdraw and they responded favorably at the time, noting that the UN Secretary General expressed in his report his concern about the violations committed in the buffer zone that Morocco voluntarily chose during the ceasefire agreement to make a weapon-free zone.
 However, the Polisario front has not stopped, for years, violating the ceasefire in this area, El Otmani said, noting that this violation was the subject of Royal messages addressed to the Secretary General of the United Nations to draw its attention to this situation.
 He noted that Morocco has the capacity to win the battle on the ground but out of respect for the ceasefire agreement and its international commitments, it expects a solution to the conflict by the UN and its secretary general.
 He deplored the fact that the latest blockage of the El Guergarat crossing lasted more than three weeks, noting that this crossing is not a Moroccan or Mauritanian issue only but it is an international trade route, including for trade between European and African countries.
 He explained that HM the King took the crucial decision at the right time to solve the problem with the intervention of the Armed Forces Kingdom in a harmless way and without clashes with the Polisario militias in order to establish a security cordon, which definitely made the difference
 Morocco's latest decision regarding the El Guergarat crossing enabled a strategic change, knowing that the separatists were still using this crossing against Morocco and its interests and causing problems to disrupt the Moroccan case, particularly with the nearing of the meetings of the Security Council to give its annual resolution, he noted.
 El Otmani thanked the brotherly and friendly African and Arab countries, as well as the Islamic and Arab organizations which unequivocally welcomed the measures taken by Morocco and voiced their support for the Kingdom.
 According to him, Morocco is now facing a second stage where the Polisario is fighting a battle of fallacious rumors after its defeat on the ground and in terms of international legality. Now the Polisario has only fake news to face the Royal Armed Forces and the realities on the ground, he said, adding that the national media have defeated these lies and proved that the videos and images run by the separatists are related to other events in other places.

"He couldn't even hold his head up straight because he had gotten so weak," said his son, Kevin Amerson. "They stopped taking care of him. They abandoned him."
 As more than 90,000 of the nation's long-term care residents have died in a pandemic that has pushed staffs to the limit, advocates for the elderly say a tandem wave of death separate from the virus has quietly claimed tens of thousands more, often because overburdened workers haven't been able to give them the care they need.
 Nursing home watchdogs are being flooded with reports of residents kept in soiled diapers so long their skin peeled off, left with bedsores that cut to the bone, and allowed to wither away in starvation or thirst.
 Beyond that, interviews with dozens of people across the country reveal swelling numbers of less clear-cut deaths that doctors believe have been fueled not by neglect but by a mental state plunged into despair by prolonged isolation ̶ listed on some death certificates as "failure to thrive."
 A nursing home expert who analyzed data from the country's 15,000 facilities for The Associated Press estimates that for every two COVID-19 victims in long-term care, there is another who died prematurely of other causes. Those "excess deaths" beyond the normal rate of fatalities in nursing homes could total more than 40,000 since March.
 These extra deaths are roughly 15% more than you'd expect at nursing homes already facing tens of thousands of deaths each month in a normal year.
 "The healthcare system operates kind of on the edge, just on the margin, so that if there's a crisis, we can't cope," said Stephen Kaye, a professor at the Institute on Health and Aging at the University of California, San Francisco, who conducted the analysis. "There are not enough people to look after the nursing home residents."
 Comparing mortality rates at homes struck by COVID-19 with ones that were spared, Kaye also found that the more the virus spread through a home, the greater the number of deaths recorded for other reasons. In homes where at least 3 in 10 residents had the virus, for example, the rate of death for reasons besides the virus was double what would be expected without a pandemic.
 That suggests the care of those who didn't contract the virus may have been impacted as healthcare workers were consumed attending to residents ill from COVID-19 or were left short-handed as the pandemic infected employees themselves.
 Chronic understaffing at nursing homes has been one of the hallmarks of the pandemic, with a few homes even forced to evacuate because so many workers either tested positive or called in sick. In 20 states where virus cases are now surging, federal data shows nearly 1 in 4 nursing homes report staff shortages.
 On New York's Long Island, Dawn Best saw that firsthand. Before COVID-19 arrived at Gurwin Jewish Nursing Home, she was pleased with the care her 83-year-old mother Carolyn Best received. She enjoyed activities, from tai-chi classes to visits from a pony, and was doted on by staff.
 But when the lockdown started and the virus began to spread in the home, Best sensed the staff couldn't handle what they had been dealt. The second time her mother, a retired switchboard operator, appeared on screen for a scheduled FaceTime call, she looked awful, her eyes closed as she moaned, flailed her arms above her head and just kept repeating "no." Best insisted a doctor check her out.
 A few hours later, the doctor called, seemingly frantic, saying she only had a moment to talk.
 "The COVID is everywhere," Best remembered her saying. "It's in every unit. The doctors have it, the nurses have it and your mother may have it."
 In the end, 59 residents at Gurwin would be killed by the virus, but Best's mother never contracted it. She died instead of dehydration, her daughter said, because the staff was so consumed with caring for COVID-19 patients that no one made sure she was drinking.
 "My mom went from being unbelievably cared for to dead in three weeks," said Best, who provided medical documents noting her mother's dehydration. "They were in over their head more than anyone could imagine."
 Representatives for Gurwin said they could not comment on Best's case. The home's administrator, Joanne Parisi, said "COVID-19 has affected us all" but that "our staff at Gurwin has been doing heroic work."
 West Hill Health and Rehab in Birmingham, Alabama, where Wallace lived prior to his Aug. 29 death, said he was "cared for with the utmost compassion, dedication and respect." Wallace's son provided medical documents outlining the conditions he described.
 The nursing home trade group American Health Care Association disputed that there has been a widespread inability of staff to care for residents and dismissed estimates of tens-of-thousands of non-COVID-19 deaths as "speculation."
 Dr. David Gifford, the group's chief medical officer, said the pandemic created "challenges" in staffing, particularly in states like New York and New Jersey hit hard by COVID-19, but added that, if anything, staffing levels have improved because of a drop in new admissions that has lightened the patient load.
 "There have been some really sad and disturbing stories that have come out," Gifford said, "but we've not seen that widespread."
 Another industry group, LeadingAge, which represents not-for-profit long-term care facilities, said staffing challenges are real, and that care homes are struggling in the face of federal inaction to provide additional stimulus money to help pay for more workers.
 "These incidents, stemming from the challenges being faced by too many committed and caring nursing home providers during this pandemic, are horrific and heartbreaking," said Katie Smith Sloan, LeadingAge's president. "I hope that these tragedies will wake up politicians and the public."
 When facilities sealed off across the country in March, advocates and inspectors were routinely kept out too, all while concerning reports trickled in, not only of serious injuries from falls or major medical declines, but of seemingly banal problems that posed serious health issues for the vulnerable.
 Mairead Painter, Connecticut's long-term care ombudsman, said with dentists shut out, ill-fitting dentures went unfixed, a factor in mounting accounts of malnutrition, and with podiatrists gone, toenails went untrimmed, posing the possibility of painful conditions in diabetes patients.
 Even more widespread, as loved ones lost access to homes, was critical help with residents' feeding, bathing, dressing and other tasks. The burden fell on aides already working tough shifts for little pay.

Spain's Interior Minister Fernando Grande-Marlaska stressed the strategic nature of relations between Spain and Morocco.
 "Morocco is a strategic partner for Spain" in all areas of bilateral cooperation, Grande-Marlaska said in an interview with MAP on the occasion of his visit to Morocco, the seventh of its kind since his appointment as Interior Minister in June 2018.
 "The Spanish government and the Interior Ministry assess very positively the current state of cooperation and collaboration with the Moroccan authorities and in particular with the Moroccan Interior Ministry," the Spanish official noted.
 "This close and fluid relationship is yielding results in a large number of areas for the benefit of the nationals of both countries," he added.
 Grande-Marlaska expressed the "firm will" of his department to move forward in this common action on the same path of mutual trust in order to achieve common objectives.
 "The joint operations between Spanish and Moroccan security forces in areas such as the fight against terrorism or the fight against criminal organizations are a the best examples of the close collaboration between the two countries and how this cooperation is mirrored in improved safety and welfare of Spanish and Moroccan nationals," the Spanish minister said.
 According to the official, "this cooperation between security services is based on mutual trust and on strong and stable relations".
 Besides the security aspect, Grande-Marlaska highlighted his country's commitment to continue its cooperation with Morocco in the management of illegal migration flows.
 "Spain is aware that it shares with Morocco a strong migratory pressure and it is committed to continue strengthening collaboration and mutual support in this area," he said.
 "This cooperation is particularly relevant with regard to the route of the Atlantic coast and the arrivals of illegal migrants in the Canary Islands, " the minister explained.
 On his visit to Morocco, Grande-Marlaska said it aims to strengthen the "excellent relations" between the two departments, which reflect the "good health" of relations linking the two Kingdoms.
 "This is my seventh official visit to Morocco since June 2018, when I took charge of the Interior portfolio, which clearly shows that Morocco is a priority partner for the Spanish government," he concluded.

But with COVID-19 cases rising in many regions, some administrators are being forced to temporarily shut down schools for weeks at a time and rely on their remote-learning programs to keep students up to speed.

At issue is the funding, of which Pittyslvania County officials say they have borne the majority, disproportionately to the service. According to a resolution from the Pittsylvania supervisors, they have funded the agencies to the tune of $1.2 million since 2011, while in that same period, Franklin County provided $200,000.
 With 16 months of negotiations — and earlier deadlines that Pittsylvania supervisors set and extended twice — failing to produce an agreement, they set the Dec. 1 deadline. The resolution included three different proposed options for solving the funding disparity.
 1\. Adjust the county boundaries so that Pittsylvania County annexes the portion of Franklin County covered by the Cool Branch emergency agencies.
 2\. Franklin County could provide $40,000 annually to help fund the agencies and reimburse half of the capital costs of future equipment purchases.
 3\. A third option would be for Franklin County to pay Pittsylvania County for each service call the Cool Branch departments make across county lines.
 If the Franklin County supervisors do not reach an agreement with their Pittsylvania County counterparts, it would result in a suspension of fire and EMS services from Cool Branch to Franklin County. Various county officials and supervisors from Pittsylvania County expressed their hope that an agreement could be reached and their hope that service would not have to be cut off.

Loughlin and Giannulli were initially both ordered to report to prison on Nov. 19 but prosecutors and the defense agreed Loughlin could begin her sentence on Oct. 30. Loughlin agreed that she would not seek early release from prison on grounds related to the coronavirus pandemic.
 Loughlin was also ordered to pay a $150,000 fine and perform 100 hours of community service, and Giannulli has to pay a $250,000 fine and perform 250 hours of community service.
 Prosecutors recorded phone calls and emails showing the couple worked with the mastermind of the scheme, admissions consultant Rick Singer, to get their daughters into USC with fake athletic profiles depicting them as star rowers. "Fantastic. Will get all," Giannulli responded and sent Singer the photo, according to the court filings.
 Nearly sixty people have been charged in the scheme led by Singer, who secretly worked with investigators and recorded his conversations with parents and coaches to help build the case against them. Singer, who is expected to testify against any defendants who go to trial, has not yet been sentenced. More than 40 people have already pleaded guilty.
 Prison terms for the parents ensnared in the scheme range from nine months to a couple weeks. Other parents who've served time behind bars in the case include "Desperate Housewives" star Felicity Huffman, who was sentenced to 14 days for paying $15,000 to rig her daughter's SAT score.

 Leading the way in practice right now for the boys team are middle school boys head coach and assistant varsity coach Dexter Beverly, assistant varsity coach Tommy Jordan, as well as Dean. With only three upperclassman this season, the Ospreys are going to see a much different look than last year. Jordan noted that two main areas the team needs to work on is ball handling and team chemistry.
 “The team chemistry is going to be huge for us,” Jordan said.
 Beverly followed his comments by saying that being a Christian-based basketball program, they are always trying and preaching about loving and knowing everybody, which will help tremendously.

"Il Gruppo "Savona Uniti per la Provincia" nei giorni scorsi ha presentato una mozione che è subito stata messa all'ordine del giorno del Consiglio e, a seguito di discussione costruttiva e relativo confronto tra tutti i componenti del Consiglio, su proposta del vice presidente e del Gruppo "Cambiamo la Provincia" è stata unificata e votata all'unanimità".

In questo giorno anche io come sindaco del Comune di Calizzano ho immediatamente proposto al Consiglio comunale convocato lunedì 9 novembre subito dopo che si erano verificati i fatti, di assumere fuori sacco (al di fuori dell'ordine del giorno), un ordine del giorno nel senso di quello che poi si è formato nei giorni successivi dal confronto trasversale e apartitico che si è immediatamente mosso sul territorio e che è stato portato avanti in primis dal Sindaco di Pietra Ligure territorialmente competente.

In this way, _chou_ performers created roles unique from all others. They sometimes played clowns with funny faces, making jokes and gags.
 There are actually different variations of _chou_ , including a civilian role called _wen chou_ , distinguished by a white dot painted on the nose of the performer, and a military role called _wu chou_.
  _Chou_ performers often generate belly laughs from audiences. Their roles focus on spoken parts and body language, instead of singing skills.
 A _wen chou_ performer often takes the roles of playboys, war veterans, prison guards, barkeepers and other minor characters. A _chou_ , wearing a scarf on his head and carrying a folding fan in hand, might play educated but pedantic people. _Chou_ in blue homespun clothes always play lower-class working people, such as fishermen, boatmen and servants.
 Emperor Li Longji of the Tang Dynasty (AD 618-907), who was fond of opera, liked to play _chou_ roles to please his favorite concubine. Since it would not be dignified for an emperor to play a clown, he wore a white jade on his nose to distinguish him from others. That started the tradition of _wen chou_ appearing with white dots painted on their noses.
 By contrast, _wu chou_ performers are good at martial arts. They are usually humorous roles, such as “good” outlaws and chivalrous thieves. They dress in body-tight clothing and show flexible, quick movements. They can jump several meters high, then land without making a sound. _Wu chou_ actors deliver their lines in loud, rhythmic voices.
 In the opera “The Nine-Dragon Cup,” the _chou_ role of Yang Xiangwu is a grassroots hero, leading a freewheeling life. When he turns 60, Yang acts rashly after being coerced into stealing the nine-dragon cup from the royal court. His lines are delivered in an old yet forceful manner.
 In the opera “Chains,” the _chou_ role of Zhu Guangzu is a lower-ranking military officer in his 30s, but he does have some social status. So his lines are often crisp and high-pitched.
 Roles of men with low morality are sometimes performed by _chou_ , such as the playboy Ximen Qing and Zhang Wenyuan, a betrayer in the episode “Asking for Tea.”
 Whether they are good or evil, high-ranking or cast-outs, well-educated or illiterate, _chou_ roles are all comical characters who appear in funny faces.
 It might be the charm of traditional opera that brings out the inner qualities of people by highlighting external characteristics.

In this report, covers the present scenario (with the base year being 2017) and the growth prospects of global Bone Cement Mixer Devices market for 2018-2023.Bone cement plays a vital role in the orthopedic and trauma surgery. It is used to plug gaps between the bones and prosthesis. It also helps support the artificial joints of shoulder, knees, and elbow. The bone cement mixer devices are used for preparing and mixing of bone cement prior to the bone access and infusion procedure.The growing demand for bone cement in interventional procedures such as vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty will, in turn, drive the adoption of bone cement mixers. For instance, Stryker offers a precision cement delivery system, which includes cement mixers used in vertebroplasty procedures for the treatment of fractures. Also, BD’s AVAmax Vertebral Balloon System uses a unipedicular, lateral method to target balloon placement across the midline of the vertebral body. This new system is used to stabilize the fracture and eliminate pain by injecting cement into the vertebra. The system includes a disposable mixer, which mixes the cement within the mixing barrel for consistent cement usage from one procedure to the next.The demand for automated bone cement mixers is on the rise because of an increased need to reduce procedure time. This will further improve patient compliance, thereby driving the adoption rates. For instance, Stryker offers AutoPlex Cement Delivery System, a fast and easy to use mixer and delivery system. This device automatically mixes the cement, which is ready for delivery in less than one minute. This device also automatically blends and transfers the cement. Exactech offers Cemex System, which features a unique, self-contained system that combines cement powder and liquid into an enclosed mixing system.Over the next five years, projects that Bone Cement Mixer Devices will register a xx% CAGR in terms of revenue, reach US$ xx million by 2023, from US$ xx million in 2017.

Of course, there have been fleeting moments of supreme quality from Pogba in the red of United, but not enough to sustain half a season, let alone a full one.      The rhetoric around him has always been 'Man United need X midfielder to accompany Pogba', or 'Pogba's not playing in his preferred position', but some days he's simply been lackadaisical, both in defence and attack, and, quite frankly, a liability.      A top class midfielder will take any game by the scruff of its neck and perform -- Steven Gerrard, Frank Lampard and Yaya Toure made careers from it. There was rarely a game that went by without one of those three stamping their authority on it. Bruno Fernandes looks to be cut from the same cloth, but it's still too early to put him in that elite bracket.      And so, it appears Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is approaching the end of his tether with Pogba, who has started on the bench in four of the last five games throughout all competitions.

Whether Manchester United were lining up under Louis van Gaal in a 3-5-2, or Jose Mourinho in a 4-3-3, the outcome was usually the same for Pogba. The sense of nostalgia from playing alongside Andrea Pirlo and Claudio Marchisio in Turin is clouding the judgement of some spectators, as they blissfully pretend Pogba was this all-encompassing Football Man at Juve.

El Gobierno ha reservado de momento en el proyecto de Presupuestos Generales del Estado 1.011 millones de euros para la compra de vacunas contra la COVID-19. Existen al margen mecanismos de ejecucion para gastos extraordinarios si fuese necesario. Los 1.011 millones son el 40% del total de los fondos europeos para la reconstruccion que van destinados al Ministerio de Sanidad, porque el proceso se sufragara basicamente de ellos. Todavia no esta detallado cuanto ira a parar a la compra en si de las dosis, y cuanto a la logistica y gastos derivados -transporte, mantenimiento, campañas- que, otra vez, seran diferentes para cada tipo. El calculo inicial preveia que la inmensa mayoria, informo el ministro Salvador Illa, fuese destinado en si a la adquisicion. Pero por ejemplo, la vacuna de Pfizer tiene unos gastos de conservacion elevados por tener que mantenerse a unos -75º. Los Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estadounidenses ya han advertido de hecho a algunos hospitales que harian bien si tienen un plan b con proyectos mas baratos. Esta vacuna no tiene un precio fijado todavia, pero de la de Oxford, por ejemplo, se sabe que costara 5,8 euros por tratamiento.
