Even so, Nike stock is firing on all cylinders ahead of the report, with the on-balance volume (OBV) accumulation-distribution indicator also hitting all- time highs. While the monthly stochastic oscillator has reached an extreme level that has triggered prior reversals, it is showing no signs of crossing over into a long-term sell cycle. As a result, downside after the report or in January should be modest and provide another opportunity to get on board.

The LSU AgCenter has named Matt Foster as the statewide specialist for cotton, corn and grain sorghum starting Jan. 19, 2021.


  He’s ready to go to work.


  “My first day is already planned out with a grower meeting to meet producers,” Foster said. “I’m already putting things on my calendar.”


  Melissa Cater, director of the AgCenter Northeast Region, said Foster is eager to start work. “He will get the program up to speed very quickly. We’re delighted to have him join our staff here,” she said.


  Foster’s qualifications and background will fit well with corn, cotton and grain sorghum cropping systems. “His skills will benefit all the people in the industry that he will be interacting with,” Cater said.


  Foster has been working as an area extension agent with sugarcane and soybeans in Ascension Parish, where he has been based, along with St. James, St. John the Baptist, St. Charles, Lafourche, Terrebonne, and Assumption parishes.


  “Working in the sugarcane industry has been a great experience,” he said.


  Foster received his doctorate degree from LSU in 2018 in agronomy under Jim Griffin. He earned a bachelor’s degree from LSU in agricultural pest management in 2012.


  Foster will be based at the AgCenter Macon Ridge Research Station near Winnsboro and also will have an office at the AgCenter Northeast Research Station at St. Joseph.


  Foster said his work as an extension agent and as an intern with the late Concordia Parish agent Glen Daniels showed him the value of extension agents.


  “In my opinion, extension agents are the lifeline of the LSU AgCenter,” Foster said. “I plan on maintaining a close relationship with parish extension agents.”


  Foster said his first experience with agriculture was while growing up in Vidalia, when he worked for a farmer and ag consultant.


  “I grew up working on a family friend’s farm at age 13 on his sweet corn operation,” Foster said.


  Eventually, Foster started scouting for crop pests “and doing anything that needed to be done on the farm.”


  AgCenter pest management specialist Al Orgeron has worked with Foster on sugarcane.


  “I think Matt is going to do a fantastic job. He’s very sharp, with a broad knowledge about Louisiana crops,” Orgeron said. “He’s well suited for the position.”

An African American healthcare worker became on Monday the first to get a shot of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine in New York, the city hit the hardest by the pandemic, as first doses of the drug were administered to Americans around the country amid much cheering and applause.


  "There's light at the end of the tunnel ... I encourage everyone to take the vaccine," said Sandra Lindsay, a critical care worker, after she was administered a primary shot of the two-dose vaccine at a New York city hospital, as other healthcare workers applauded, joined in by Governor Andrew Cuomo through video link. Many in the African American community are distrustful of vaccines because of a history of racially charged medical experimentations.


  "First Vaccine Administered. Congratulations USA! Congratulations WORLD!" President Donald Trump wrote in a tweet shortly, but it was not immediately clear if he was referring to Lindsay or some other case as first shots of the vaccine began to be administered around the country on Monday. Earlier, he had reversed a White House decision to vaccinate personnel around the president in the first lot. He moved them back to their usual positions in the priority line.


  Frontline healthcare workers and residents of long-term nursing home facilities have been prioritised by US public health authorities for vaccination, which started Monday following expedited approval of the Pfizer- BioNTech medicine by the drug and food safety regulator and related health surveillance agencies over the weekend.


  The vaccine's journey from Pfizer's manufacturing facility in Michigan was followed breathlessly by news TV crews, for a nation starving for good news. Cameras recorded trucks carrying the vaccines emerging from the facility and cargo flights carrying them from a nearby airport for onward destinations.


  A local Michigan couple came to the airport to watch the flights take off. That was the stuff of history, like the moon landing, they said.


  Nearly 3 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines will be administered at 600 sites around the country immediately, with millions more over the next days.


  A second vaccine -- from Moderna -- is on the way as well, and is expected to become available for emergency use through the same expedited process.


  New York state accounted for more than 35,000 of the nearly 300,000 Americans killed by coronavirus in the United States thus far, according to the Johns Hopkins University. An estimated 65% of the New York deaths were in New York City making it the worst hit in the world. The United States has been the most badly affected in the world with more than 16 million infections and it is undergoing a new surge.

PETA celebrated the news with “virtual champagne corks,” considering it a signal that “fur is well and truly dead.” Humane Society International responded similarly, and urged governments to focus on supporting fur farmers as they move to more humane endeavors. “There was never going to be a happy ending for the 60 million mink exploited for fur annually,” the group said, “but stopping breeding them altogether would be the best way to prevent animals suffering in the future for the fickle whims of fashion.”

How are enterprises going to protect themselves without the benefit of enterprise security controls?

The city's first butterfly park, commissioned by the forest department in Sector 52 two years ago, has ceased to operate and is currently in a state of disrepair. Officials in the forest department confirmed that presently, there are no butterfly conservation activities underway at the park, which has been shut to public since March this year. Officials also said there are no immediate plans to revive the project.


  An HT team on Monday found that the park has been gated shut, while the approach road is being used as a parking lot for tempos by independent contractors. However, one can still enter the premises (which forms a small part of the forest department's 19-acre nursery in Sector 52) from a second entrance, located about 500 metres on Ambedkar Road, just around the corner from Tau Devi Lal Biodiversity Park.


  Inside, the butterfly park is a shade of its former self. The lack of upkeep was evident, and in multiple places, one can observe the withering remains of saplings planted by visitors. While the area remains forested, it is overrun with weeds and is not being actively maintained, according to staffers at the department nursery.


  The butterfly gardens, bathrooms and picnic spots all bore a decrepit look. No butterflies could be spotted either, although, at the time of its launch two years ago, the park was reportedly home to 27 different species.


  Originally conceived by the forest department in 2017, the butterfly park, named Thousand Shades Butterfly Park, was launched in collaboration with a city-based NGO on May 23, 2018, on the occasion of World Biodiversity Day. At the time, the department had spent nearly Rs 3 crore on setting up the park, including the cost of planting specific vegetation to attract butterflies and setting up indoor and outdoor conservatories for their breeding.


  The park had one outdoor conservatory, aimed at conserving specific butterfly species, including the common emigrant, mottled emigrant, small gross-yellow, peacock pansy, lemon pansy, common pierrot, blue pansy and great eggfly. An indoor conservatory, specifically aimed at conserving the plain tiger butterfly, which is commonly seen in the region, had also been created, but is no longer operational.


  Close to 150 different species of host plants -- including lemon, bel, akawan, chakunda and harsingar trees -- were planted in early 2018 to attract various butterfly species. In the first year of its operation, the park became a popular destination for students and picnickers, hosting educational tours and plantation drives for groups of schoolchildren. As plantation work was to be carried out for a period of five years, ending in 2022, visitors were encouraged to plant saplings to commemorate their time there.


  Subash Yadav, a metropolitan green planner with the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority, and former district forest officer (DFO) with the state forest department, said that breeding activities at the park had stopped even earlier than March 2020.


  "Sometime in 2019, we realised that the concessionaire had been violating our memorandum of understanding. Visitors to the park were being charged for entry, whereas the NGO was only allowed to raise money via CSR funding. They had also created a pukka road to enter the park, which is not allowed on forest land. The intention was to create a butterfly conservation centre to educate visitors, but the concessionaire was turning it a commercial undertaking," said Yadav.


  In fact, the district forest department in 2019 also prosecuted Sanjay Kaushik, the director of the NGO, Uthaan, for violations of the Wildlife Act. "The concessionaire had kept four grey partridges at the site in cages, which is against the law. There were also two emu birds and several rabbits that were kept there. This was nowhere permitted in our agreements. At the direction of the environmental court in Faridabad, the partridges were seized and then released in Sultanpur National Park," said Yadav.


  Probing these violations, an internal forest department committee in 2019 had recommended terminating the agreement with Uthaan. "At present, our MoU does not stand. Before we could terminate the agreement, we received a representation from the NGO saying they do not wish to continue as the concessionaire. Then, after lockdown, they stopped maintaining the park entirely," said a senior forest department official, seeking anonymity.


  The state forest department is yet to take a call on appointing a new concessionaire or running the park independently. "There is no decision on the cards yet," said the official cited above.


  Sanjay Kaushik, founder and director of the NGO Uthaan, refuted the forest department's allegations, but did not specifically respond to each one, when asked. "All I can say is we are no longer maintaining the butterfly park. Uthaan has not been maintaining it since March this year."


  The presiding district forest officer, Jai Kumar, declined to comment on the issue.


  Vasvi Tyagi, chief conservator of forests, could not be reached despite multiple attempts on Monday.

Twenty years ago, the reputation of British food in Japan was disastrous. A Japanese friend once described it as "prison food" after seeing a photo of the much-loved British fry up - a breakfast plate which usually includes baked beans, fried eggs, fried bread, black pudding and mushrooms. In all honesty he wasn't too far from the truth. Growing up in Scotland in the ‘80s and ‘90s, food was an afterthought. Mince, packet curry, meat and potatoes with the occasional foray into "foreign" food such as Chinese and Indian takeouts, which probably didn't resemble anything like authentic Chinese and Indian cuisine.

 # Local man wins $10,000 in "Forged in Fire" competition, will buy equipment for his shop
 Jeff Barron
 Lancaster Eagle-Gazette
 View Comments
 LANCASTER - Josh Wentz said the hardest part of competing for $10,000 on the History channel's "Forged in Fire" was that he couldn't divulge the results until the show aired.
 "I can't keep a secret to save my life," he said. "I wanted to tell friends and family. I told my family and a couple really close friends, and that was basically it."
 The secret can now be revealed - Wentz won the top prize on the episode titled "Springfield M1905 Bayonet" that aired last week. He kept that secret for two months before the airing.
 "I watched it with a couple friends and family members," Wentz said. "Some didn't know that I'd won so it was pretty exciting to watch it play out and see their reaction."
 He said he had a feeling he was going to win as the taping wound down.
 "But actually hearing them say I'm the new "Forged in Fire" champion was kind of surreal," Wentz said. "I was like, 'All right, they said my name. It's official.'"
 He joked with his wife, Lexie, that he didn't win, before finally telling her the truth.
 "I think she screamed through the phone," Wentz, an Army veteran, said. "She jumped up and down and every one of my family members were super excited. It was a pretty awesome time."
 "Forged in Fire" consists of four competitors forging knives and vying for the $10,000 first prize. For Wentz's show, the four had to make a bayonet that would fit on the end of a rifle from scratch. He made his at his home shop, then took it for judging and taping the show in Stamford, Connecticut, in September.
 Wentz, 31, owns Dreadnought Knife Shop and sells his products online. A casting agent found him on Instagram and contacted him before interviewing him in June. Part of the filming featured Wentz in his shop here. He said that was special because the shooting included his 18-month-old son in it.
 "That's something I can keep for the rest of my life," Wentz said of his son's appearance. "I can watch it over and over again. It's something that's really special to me. I love that they showed my son."
 The episode was shot over a period of a few weeks, with Wentz going to Connecticut twice.
 Wentz has already received his prize money and plans to use some of it to buy a hydraulic press from a fellow knife maker in Oregon.
 "That's going to be a much needed upgrade to my shop," he said. "Right now I'm traveling an hour to an hour and a half away to a press shop to use his. So now I can do that right here at home."
 Wentz said the show sometimes brings back former champions to compete again. He said he'd be open to that depending on his work schedule.
 Wentz is the second local contestant in recent years on "Forged in Fire." Amanda native Todd Bitler finished second in 2017.

  # Learning to operate the higher technology of Prius hybrid


  Susanne Farrington


  NOTES FROM THE WOODSHED


  A couple of months ago, my partner bought an all-electric car to replace his 2001 Prius hybrid. His new 2016 Nissan Leaf has a range of about 100 miles, which meant that if we planned on driving to Long Island to visit his 95-year- old mother on Thanksgiving, we’d have to drive my car.


  I had misgivings about taking my 2002 Prius hybrid because its inspection was a month overdue. It had already failed inspection once because the “check engine” light was on again, responding to a broken bypass valve having to do with gas vapors.


  This time, I felt that my car was sliding into the universal sinkhole of multiple, expensive repairs that I would regret in hindsight. So I started shopping for a fairly-recent plug-in Prius.


  Long story short, I chose a 2014 Prius hybrid that had a simple exterior, not the kind with the ferocious, heavy-looking front. I wanted a familiar-looking dashboard. But of course that was impossible because new, high-tech capabilities had been developed since my 2002 Prius was built.


  No car designer would voluntarily leave out all the bells and whistles they’d worked so hard to produce. So currently I’m learning just the basic information my new Prius requires for driving and charging.


  The Prius manual says: “Do not plug the charging cord into an extension cord.” Bad news. After receiving conflicting advice, I have plugged in the charging cord to a 100-foot, extra heavy-duty, number 12 extension cord. So far, it’s working but I’m holding my breath. In the future, I’d like to have a buried wire going to my garage; one that is safe from my lawnmower and the neighbor’s snow blower.


  I am disappointed that my Prius will only go a dozen miles in “all-electric” mode before it switches to hybrid. That means my local driving will be cheap and carbon-free but not the longer trips. Yet, hybrid mode is still a thrifty mode of transportation compared to conventional gasoline engines. And I don’t have to worry about my battery running out of power and leaving me stranded.


  I also discovered to my chagrin that my flip-phone will not help me if I try to charge the vehicle away from home where an “app” is required to activate the public charging stations. I fear that my hesitation in adapting to these new-fangled devices is going to limit me.


  Still, I’m glad to join the thousands of car drivers who have reduced their carbon footprints by using electricity instead of gasoline to power their trips.


  For people who have purchased all-electric (EV) cars, driving them is a real economic advantage. Their fuel is cheaper and maintenance costs are low because the gasoline engine was eliminated.


  I think we can look forward to future generations of improved batteries that will increase their driving range.

  "Luckily, David had a look before he chucked it in the bin," Valkenborgh, now a college photography technician and visiting lecturer at the University of Hertfordshire, told CNN.


  Inside the can was a remarkable image, which shows the evolution of the Bayfordbury Observatory -- the dome of the observatory's oldest telescope is visible to the left of the image, while the atmospheric gantry, which was built halfway through the exposure, can be spotted from the center to the right of the picture.


  Long-exposure photography is often used to show the passing of time in a scene, and can be achieved in both modern or older cameras by leaving the shutter open for a prolonged period.


  The record for the longest exposure image is thought to be held by German artist Michael Wesely, with an image tracking four years and eight months, according to the University of Hertfordshire.

This note analyzes the stress experienced (and caused) by open-end mutual funds during the March COVID-19 stress episode, with a focus on global fixed- income funds. In light of increased valuation uncertainty, funds experienced a short period of intense withdrawals while the market liquidity of their holdings deteriorated substantially. To cover redemptions, afflicted funds predominantly shed liquid assets first—for example, cash, cash equivalents, and US Treasury securities. But forced asset sales amplified price pressures in markets and contributed to liquidity falling across fixed-income markets. This drop in market liquidity, as well as the general stress in financial markets, may have led to fund investors becoming even more sensitive to challenging portfolio performance and encouraged further withdrawals. Only after central banks intervened, directly and indirectly supporting asset managers, did liquidity and redemption stress subside. Overall, the March episode validated the financial-stability concerns about liquidity vulnerabilities in the fund industry and calls for further action to address them.

  # A look back at Lincus, a memorable character of Eaton, NY history


  Back Street Mary Messere


  HISTORY FROM THE BACK STREET


  History marches on to the tune of a different drummer every year. The events that occur during the year’s time mark the year in our memories and on New Year’s Day it is the custom of many to remember the past years and reminisce.


  On New Year’s Day 18 years ago, Wood House lost one of its inhabitants for most of the last 20 years and I sat and thought about all that transpired in his time.


  Lincus, as he was called, had been through the worst and the best this town has to offer. Old Linc had been in the house when there was no heat, electric or food and had eaten anything presented to him including endless days of pea soup (made with nothing but peas and water) and bread, oatmeal, sunfish meat (deboned) or whatever. Nothing seemed to bother him.


  Each morning he set out on his route about Eaton regardless of the weather (be it 99 degrees) and each night he took a before-bed tour to make sure nothing had changed, even if it was 30 below.


  Lincus’ genes seemed to come from the finest stock of old Eaton itself. His family had most likely been here for more generations than I can count, perhaps even back to the times of the Native Americans’ first inhabitancy. His family stayed while settlers picked up and moved west because of the poor conditions and outrageous weather swings.


  Why, just this week I recorded on our digital thermometer at the Wood House a low of 21 and a high of 71 degrees - almost a 50 degree change in 24 hours. But alas, none of this ever seemed to bother Linc.


  Lincus was on hand for all of our history events and sat near the wood stove listening to all the plans for bicentennials and history days with a quiet resolve. Nothing seemed to change his outlook on life; he just watched history go by. His motto was doing what you must to survive and forget the trouble and look only to what God has given you and the future.


  He came to the Wood House in January, years ago during a blizzard. He was a full-grown cat that looked like a lynx out of the wild with thick fur, perfect lynx markings and tufts in his ears. He died on New Year’s Day 2004 at about what we guessed 24 years old. He took his usual morning spin around town … came home, laid next to the stove and died.


  Old Lincus, a piece of Eaton history and the house’s history will be missed with a whole rack of strays that have been dumped. They arrived for the most part to find food and a place to warm up.


   _Messere posts stories online regularly to share a look at Eaton’s past. She encourages everyone to share and help entertain and educate home schoolers, older relatives and anyone with an interest in the area’s rich history. For more history stories on Eaton visit historystarproduction.com._

Vaccination coverage this year has plummeted to levels last seen in the 1990s. For some vaccinations, a delay of a few months is not a huge problem and can simply be made up once immunization programs are up and running again. However, for highly contagious diseases like measles, even a short pause in vaccinations can lead to a spike in cases and death, mostly among children under five years old.

Removing the minimum would clear the way for No. 3 Ohio State to play in the Big Ten championship game on Dec. 19 against No. 15 Northwestern. less

In his novels, he does exactly that: disguise austerity with excess, good with bad, moral with immoral. He loved best the privacy of writing. Which is why he didn't do literary festivals. As much as he could, he stayed away from interviews. "There are times, usually at night, when I wish I'd never given an interview at all. First, you invent yourself, then you get to believe your invention. That is not a process that is compatible with self-knowledge," writes le Carre, who loved writing on the hoof, in notebooks on walks, in trains and cafes, and, almost always, by hand, preferring to remain with the centuries-old tradition of "unmechanized" writing. The lapsed graphic artist in him actually enjoyed "drawing the words".
 Throughout his long career, he kept no diary, and relied on the odd travel note or line of irretrievable dialogue. Men and women of power drew him because "they were there" and because he wanted to know "what made them tick."

Previously, there were some indications that the next new episode (supposedly titled "Sunburn") could air as early as Tuesday, January 5. That's not happening now. CBS just unveiled their tentative schedule for the week of January 4, and there is a repeat of "In the Wind" set for the 5th. What's interesting is that over the next month, the network is planning to replay the entirety of the Ziva arc from season 17 on Tuesday nights. Clearly, they're proud of it, and they also know that Cote de Pablo's return equals some pretty good ratings for them. If you ever wanted more evidence that Ziva _could_ return down the road, that's more or less it -- though we've already reported that it won't be happening anytime soon.

Sri Lanka coach Mickey Arthur, who arrived in South Africa to make necessary arrangements for the team's arrival was disappointed after learning about Mathews' injury.   "Just arrived in SA and watched commentary of the @LPLT20 well done @GalleGladiators but please can we have no more of our test squad injured @OfficialSLC," Arthur tweeted.   Mathews, who captained the Kings, played all the nine games in LPL but sustained the injury while on a run-up during his fourth over in the semi- final on Sunday. The all-rounder had to immediately leave the field owing to the pain and didn't take further part in the match.   "[The injury] had been building up. I wanted to rest myself and wasn't able to rest myself during the tournament. Even the previous game I felt it a little bit, and then I felt it go in the last game," Mathews said.   After the conclusion of the South Africa tour, Sri Lanka will host England in a two-match Test series. The England series against Sri Lanka was postponed in March this year due to the coronavirus pandemic and the rearranged tour will now be held behind closed doors in Galle. (ANI)

LONDON (AP) — Britain’s government is in talks with French firm EDF Energy over the construction of a 20 billion-pound ($26.8 billion) nuclear power plant in eastern England. Officials said Monday that negotiations are taking place over the Sizewell C site in Suffolk, which could generate 3.2 gigawatts of electricity — enough to provide 7% of the country’s energy demands. Any deal would need to be approved on areas such as value for money and affordability. Business Secretary Alok Sharma said the talks with EDF are not a “green light” for construction to begin. The statement confirming the talks came as the government outlined its plans to cut emissions and expand clean energy.

"This is the light at the end of the tunnel. But it's a long tunnel," New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said as he watched Lindsay's vaccination via video.


  Several other countries also have OK'd the vaccine, including the U.K., which started vaccinating last week.


  For health care workers who, along with nursing home residents, will be first in line for vaccination, hope is tempered by grief and the sheer exhaustion of months spent battling a coronavirus that still is surging in the U.S. and around the world.


  "This is mile 24 of a marathon. People are fatigued. But we also recognize that this end is in sight," said Dr. Chris Dale of Swedish Health Services in Seattle.


  Packed in dry ice to stay at ultra-frozen temperatures, the first of nearly 3 million doses being shipped in staggered batches this week made their way by truck and by plane around the country Sunday from Pfizer's Kalamazoo, Michigan, factory. Once they arrive at distribution centers, each state directs where the doses go next.


  Some hospitals across the country spent the weekend tracking their packages, refreshing FedEx and UPS websites for clues.


  More of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine will arrive each week. And later this week, the FDA will decide whether to green light the world's second rigorously studied COVID-19 vaccine, made by Moderna Inc.

Now the hurdle is to rapidly get vaccine into the arms of millions, not just doctors and nurses but other at-risk health workers such as janitors and food handlers — and then deliver a second dose three weeks later.


  "We're also in the middle of a surge, and it's the holidays, and our health care workers have been working at an extraordinary pace," said Sue Mashni, chief pharmacy officer at Mount Sinai Health System in New York City.


  Plus, the shots can cause temporary fever, fatigue and aches as they rev up people's immune systems, forcing hospitals to stagger employee vaccinations.


  A wary public will be watching closely to see whether health workers embrace vaccination. Just half of Americans say they want to get vaccinated, while about a quarter don't and the rest are unsure, according to a recent poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Health Research.


  The FDA, considered the world's most strict medical regulator, said the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine appears safe and strongly protective -- and laid out the data behind it in a daylong public meeting last week for scientists and consumers alike to see.


  "Please people, when you look back in a year and you say to yourself, 'Did I do the right thing?' I hope you'll be able to say, 'Yes, because I looked at the evidence,'" Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, said Sunday on NBC's Meet the Press. "People are dying right now. How could you possibly say, 'Let's wait and see.'"


  Still, emergency use means the vaccine was cleared for widespread use before a final study in nearly 44,000 people is complete -- and that research is continuing to try to answer additional questions. While effective against COVID-19 illness, it's not yet clear if vaccination will stop the symptomless spread that accounts for half of all cases.


  The shots still must be studied in children, and during pregnancy. But the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists said late Sunday that vaccination should not be withheld from pregnant women who otherwise would qualify.


  While the vaccine was determined to be safe, regulators in the U.K. are investigating several severe allergic reactions. The FDA's instructions tell providers not to give it to those with a known history of severe allergic reactions to any of its ingredients.
