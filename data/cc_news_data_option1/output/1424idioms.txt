Gonzalo Higuain has been handed a two-match ban after an on- pitch meltdown following his dismissal in AC Milan's 2-0 defeat to his parent club Juventus on Sunday. Higuain endured a nightmare showing against Juve, missing a penalty before receiving his marching orders in the second half. The Argentina international had to be led off the pitch by team-mates after he reacted furiously to referee Paolo Mazzoleni's decision to show him a straight red card. Higuain was initially booked for…

Although Freeland had held a 10-point lead midway through the third period, Coach Charley Miller’s Bulldogs battled into a 40-40 tie shortly after the last quarter started (behind) Kenny Warfel and Tom Mariano. With six minutes left Warfel left the game on personal fouls, Johnny Palko making good (on) one of the two tries on the play to give Freeland a 41-40 lead. George Stefanick added two more free throws to boost the Whippet edge to 43-40, but Lloyd Seaman’s one-hander kept Hummelstown close at 43-42.

HILLSDALE - Jacob Kingsley, a life-long resident of Hillsdale County, is on the upswing recovering from the novel coronavirus at home.
 Kingsley said he woke up on March 16 with a sore throat and a dry cough but thought nothing of it.
 "I didn't think nothing of it then," Kingsley said.
 His conditions deteriorated on March 18 and on March 24 a 103 degree fever took over his body with no relief from over the counter medications.
 On March 25 Kingsley went to Hillsdale Hospital where he was tested for the coronavirus; those test results came back positive on March 28.
 Kingsley has been quarantined at home since he started feeling ill and said on Thursday he is finally on the upswing from the virus which he described as the flu on steroids.
 He described his symptoms as excruciating pain - the worst he has ever felt - that started with a headache, then the pain travelled to his joints and chest.
 "It was so severe, the pain aspect is by far the worst thing," Kingsley said.
 His fever subsided recently and he reports he's almost back to full health, albeit his muscle strength has deteriorated.
 "It's going to take quite a bit for me to get my strength back," Kingsley said.
 The million dollar question that goes unanswered: Kingsley doesn't know where he came into contact with the virus.
 Kingsley has worked at Camp Michindoh for years and hasn't travelled recently.
 Kingsley urged other Michiganders Thursday to abide by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer's "Stay Home, Stay Safe" executive order issued in March.
 "I wish people would take it as serious as they say it is," Kingsley said. "It's not the flu. It's like the flu on steroids."
 Hillsdale County had 63 confirmed cases of COVID-19 Wednesday and reported six deaths contributed to the illness.
 County Commissioner Mark Wiley called Hillsdale County a "rural hotspot" in an interview with WCSR this week.
 Healthcare workers at the Hillsdale County Medical Care Facility are working to contain an outbreak in their facility that is affecting residents and staff.

“They had faux lists and practiced going through the grocery aisles looking for products,” said Naylor.
 “Due to current shortages, no products were taken off the shelves,” added Grocery Department Manager Chris Wubben, who has been with Walmart 25 years.
 Word spread via social media about the new free pickup service and, by Friday, the first official day, the time slots were full. Online grocery shoppers are encouraged to reserve a pickup time before creating their shopping list. If no time slots are available that fit their timeframe, they may have to return later to the app or website.
 Currently, there are nine associates tasked with taking the online orders and doing the shopping. They expect to fill 50 to 60 orders per day initially. They are looking to add two more associates.
 The associates are trained to look for the best produce and use the certified scales to get as close as possible to the exact amount requested. In the case of an unavailable product, a substitution is sought. Naylor explained that if the consumer wants a gallon of milk, a suggested substitution may be two half- gallons. Or, if a particular brand was not readily available, a higher quality would be selected but the lower price charged. If a substitution is required, a notification will be sent to the customer for approval.
 The free service currently requires a $30 minimum purchase and a three-hour lead time. Pickup time slots are an hour-long window of opportunity. The consumer can also alert the store they are on their way or the app can be set to track the user’s smartphone.
 Several reserved parking spaces for the pickup service are located on the south side of the building. Just look for the bright orange signs.

 The highly respected executive has been linked with a move to both Barca and Manchester United, having joined Roma from Sevilla in 2017 after helping the Spanish club win 11 trophies in his tenure.
 Paris Saint-Germain and Atletico Madrid have also been mentioned in connection with Monchi, who saw Roma reach the semi-finals of the Champions League in his first full season in the job.
 However, speaking before Roma's win over Sampdoria, Monchi told Sky Sport Italia: "I'm happy to work here and I want to stay for many years because I have a lot of confidence in the club.
 "I hope the rumours of my departure stop. I don't want to leave, my goal is to work in the best way that I can. As long as there is trust, I will stay here. My only idea is to stay here."
 Roma cruised to a 4-1 win against Samp thanks to goals from Juan Jesus and Patrik Schick and a double from Stephan El Shaarawy.

 I am a wife and mother (daughter and sister).
 I am a ba'alat teshuva, who left behind an illustrious career in television for the never-ending pursuit of a meaningful life in the Holy Land.
 I am a serial entrepreneur and small business owner who invests in her business before herself in a vain attempt to grow a media empire.
 I am a woman who often neglects herself and her relationships in the name of career - ignoring the trend toward self-care.
 I am a human being who falls asleep at night feeling like a failure, realizing I could have been a better daughter, wife, mother and citizen of this world.
 I am a person whose faith, trust in God and joie de vivre waiver, on a regular basis.
 Despite or perhaps in light of all of the above, I have something to say that I think is worth reading.
 My message is simple. All that stuff above has to change. Because if it doesn't, then I missed the message of this pandemic. If I don't change in at least one tiny meaningful way, or in (God willing) a 100 tiny meaningful ways, then I have lost.
 Because I am pretty sure this plague was not set upon humanity so I can bake DIY Disney-character cupcakes with my kids. That's certainly a happy side effect of this ordeal, but if my faith, my relationships and my character are not improved, then there is really no hope of me getting out of these pajamas anytime soon.
 Oh yeah, sure, sure, the world might return to "normal," but with no change I'll just continue sleepwalking right through it.

MORE ENDEAVORS THIS YEAR
 The publication of “All I Ever Wanted” was to be the first in a series of Go- Go’s-related endeavors slated for 2020. The band had scheduled a reunion tour, pre-coronavirus, to begin in June. A well-received documentary on the quintet is set to air on Showtime after it earned kudos at Sundance, though a premiere date hasn’t yet been announced.
 From Valentine’s perspective, the Go-Go’s earned every ounce of that attention as part of a small flock of what she calls “rare birds” who soared through rock and pop despite oft-lecherous and dismissive music industry vultures looking for prey.
 “It’s a story that hasn’t been told enough, the one about a young girl who decides she wants to be in a rock ‘n’ roll band and then does just that,” writes Valentine. “There aren’t many of us, and there are even fewer who stick with it their whole lives.”
 During a recent FaceTime conversation from her home in Austin, Valentine said that for teenage girls growing up in the early 1970s, to envision a career in rock was a ridiculous notion, as her disapproving, absent father made clear at nearly every opportunity but her thrill-seeking, oft-absent mom accepted.
 “Even though I was playing the guitar, it never occurred to me to plug it into an amp and be in a band,” Valentine says.
 Throughout the memoir, Valentine recounts in vivid detail the gloriously debauched path of the Go-Go’s through early rock success. As record sales pile up, she shoplifts six-packs during all-night Sunset Boulevard benders with her soon-to-be-dead friend John Belushi, pals around with Brat Pack heartthrob Rob Lowe, goes on overnight LSD trips at the most inopportune of moments and outpaces Rod Stewart during coke binges. She falls in love with Blondie drummer Clem Burke, who tries to rein in Valentine’s drug use.
 It was important to ensure “that people who read my book knew what it felt like to have been a musician for several years, then to get onstage with the Go-Go’s for the first time and realize that the part that’s been missing,” Valentine says. “I’d never had sold out shows, night after night of fans. It was exhilarating.”
 Describing one such backstage victory while on tour with the Police, Valentine says she wanted to get readers into the room “to know what it felt like when Sting, the singer of the biggest band in the world, comes in with Champagne and says, ‘Your record has passed us!’”

The accelerated launch has only added to a hectic time for Hehir and his team.
 There has been much anticipation about the documentary, which in Hehir’s mind came together much faster than such a project usually does.
 “Normally, to do an hourlong archival documentary from start to finish, it takes about a year from the inception of the idea to the research to doing all the shooting to getting it all together, storyboarding it out, mapping it out, editing, getting notes back, it takes about a year,” Hehir said. “We’re doing 10 of those. And we had a little bit over two years to do it so we’re already working at five times our normal rate.”
 The pandemic further complicates matters. Hehir and his team are finishing things up while separated, connecting through Zoom meetings but largely in isolation at their own laptops to get the last pieces of the story ready to air.
 The documentary goes deeper than just 1997-98, though that season is the overriding theme. It also serves as a retrospective of Jordan’s basketball life, from his college days at North Carolina through his rise atop the NBA.
 Hehir knows there is an ongoing buildup and anticipation surrounding the documentary, and still feels nervousness. He met with Jordan several times over the course of the project, including three sit-down interviews that are part of the documentary.

“I think we are honestly still in the early stages of figuring out how to make this work as good as we can,” said IndyCar driver Conor Daly. “You have four different areas where your brand can build — Twitch, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter ... maybe I continue to develop a YouTube channel, who knows? There’s stuff that I think you’ll end up doing during this time that will no matter what help you in the long run, and that’s just what we’re trying to do is when we do go back to racing.
 “Maybe we’ve built a bigger fan base, we’ve built a bigger brand for our sponsors and the people that do support us.”
 All of which would be welcome news for motorsports, which has faded since its heyday amid attendance and sponsorship declines. For now, virtual racing will have to do.
 NASCAR was able to push out its iRacing Series that already had tremendous infrastructure from an existing league for serious gamers. There was a draft with real teams such as Joe Gibbs Racing, Chip Ganassi Racing and Team Penske selecting gamers to represent them.
 All NASCAR had to do was grab its product, swap the amateur racers with its stars, and Fox Sports said it would broadcast the races. Viewership in two of the last three Fox races were the most watched in esports history and the cable networks have all scrambled to create their own virtual racing content.
 “All of the race teams are trying everything they can to keep their sponsors and keep their employees,” said Dale Earnhardt Jr., the retired NASCAR star who is a longtime virtual racing fanatic, owner of an Xfinity Series team and NBC Sports analyst.

The other core message within China’s narrative is that “China has acted as a responsible big country” in playing a leadership role to combat the virus based on President Xi Jinping’s concept of a “Community of Shared Future for Mankind.”
 China has backed its narrative by launching a “mask diplomacy” campaign, providing medical masks and ventilators as well as dispatching personnel to countries seeking aid.
 Taiwan, however, serves as an example to combat the “China model” rhetoric. The island has outperformed China in dealing with the coronavirus without resorting to the strict measures touted by Beijing.
 Taiwan has had less than 380 confirmed cases and five deaths as of Wednesday — a remarkable feat considering Taiwan’s proximity to China.
 Much to Beijing’s chagrin, praise of Taiwan’s success has provided the island with much-needed global exposure, granting President Tsai Ing-wen a success in her strategy to utilize Taiwan’s identity as a democracy to garner international support.
 Taiwan has conducted its own mask diplomacy and, more importantly, countered the idea that China’s anti-coronavirus model is the prime model to follow by providing a more attractive alternative to democracies.
 Beijing’s Taiwan Affairs Office has decried Taiwan’s mask diplomacy as “taking the wrong path of ‘worshipping everything foreign’ and engaging in a confrontation with the Motherland.”
 Beijing has also criticized Taiwan’s cooperation with the United States as the DPP’s “despicable move and political plot to use the COVID-19 pandemic to achieve independence.”
 Ironically, Beijing’s maladroit diplomacy and propaganda are contributing to Taiwan’s success in undercutting China’s PR offensive.
 Other than providing defective supplies, exporting medical supplies rather than donating them as claimed, and providing aid according to how “potential recipients have treated China in the past,” the combative speech of Chinese diplomats and its misinformation campaign to deflect blame onto the United States have discredited Xi’s “community of mankind” narrative.
 The war of narratives is largely dependent on credibility, which China continues to lack by pushing debunkable narratives and expelling foreign journalists. For the time being, Taiwan will continue to be upheld as an exemplar for its transparency and prompt reaction in contrast with China.

“Fairmont Senior wrestling is a big deal in the state, and we’ve had many state champions. It’s really special to be leading our stats [at the end of my career]. I can’t really put words to it, but it’s really special to me.”
 Frazier proved an absolute force at the heavyweight level for four consecutive years across the state of West Virginia — perhaps the best way to adequately convey quite how he terrorized opponents was the reaction of a competitor who drew him in the Big 10 Championships this winter. As the two met to shake hands, Frazier’s foe looked at the referee and uttered the words, “I don’t want to play anymore.”
 Of course, not much more can be expected when you face someone who, in the 139 matches he wrestled an opponent, he pinned 82 percent of them. Looking at his junior and senior seasons alone, that stat jumps to 91.4 percent. Of his two career losses, one came in a 1-0 decision as a freshman. The second came by disqualification for using excessive force with an arm bar when his opponent could not continue wrestling due to injury – Frazier had a comfortable 6-2 lead at the time.
 According to Delligatti, there were other wrestlers who have come along during Frazier’s career who may have had a bit more natural talent or athleticism, but what continuously set Frazier over the top was combining his Division 1 talents as an athlete with a work ethic and intelligence level that is second- to-none.
 “The thing that makes Zach Frazier special is that he’s got talent, but he works hard, and that’s the key. He works hard when no one is looking, he’s in the gym, busting his butt, and doesn’t take off. That’s the key if you want to be successful, is putting the time in when no one is around. If you do that and you have talent, that’s what happens, and that’s what he did,” Delligatti said.
 “He’s got the ability too, but he holds himself to that standard. He always knew what his abilities were at a young age and he knew what those abilities were going to be like as he got over, so he worked on the certain moves he knew he was going to use in high school while he was a younger kid. There’s an old saying, that if you do something a thousand times you’ll master it … Zach didn’t have this huge repertoire of moves, he kept it simple. People couldn’t stop his moves.”
 Frazier — who has worked with Delligatti consistently since his seventh-grade season on the mat — has always been a firm believer in the idea that you should give 110 percent, no matter the situation, which he said naturally transferred over to his career in wrestling. From there, he attributes his work with Delligatti to helping forge a “simple, sweet, and tough to beat” mentality when it comes to how he tackles challenges in the athletic world.
 “No matter what sport it is, I always try to give my full effort in anything I do, really. I’ve always tried to be the best I can be, and that’s what I’ve pushed for. The fundamentals of wrestling, if you’re good at that, a couple moves here and there, that’s really all you need. You don’t need to know every move there is, you just need to get good at something and make it yours. Coach Delligatti has worked with me for a while on stuff like that, and that’s just what I’ve done over the years,” Frazier said.

Burnley's Aaron Lennon hopes his openness about mental health issues have helped normalise the subject among professional football players.
 Lennon was detained under the UK's Mental Health Act in May 2017 over concerns about his wellbeing, during his time at Everton.
 The 31-year-old is confident the worst of the stress-related illness he was suffering from is behind him, and now hopes to be a role model for his peers.
 "There's probably a lot of footballers who don't want to come and speak about it but it's just normal," Lennon said. "There's going to be spells where you don't feel so great and there's going to be spells where you do feel great.
 "Hopefully it opens the door for people to say, 'OK, I'm not feeling good.' There's so much help out there and hopefully I can be an example that you might be going through a tough time but you can get back to where you want to be, enjoying football, enjoying life again."
 Lennon has been a reinvigorated figure since moving to Burnley in January, thriving under the positive environment Sean Dyche has helped cultivate.
 "Touch wood, I've been really good since. You learn a lot about yourself during those periods," Lennon said. "I had to take a look at myself, but I've got a great family, great friends and the clubs I've been at have been fantastic.
 "Everyone's different. I can see why people might think it's a constant battle. I feel great, it doesn't cross my mind. You do look back and say, 'Wow, I can't believe I was in that place."
 Meanwhile, Dyche has welcomed a change in attitude towards the subject of mental health, praising footballers for openly attempting to handle the psychological demands of profession.
 "It was the 'get on with it' mentality when I was playing, and we all know that's changed now," the Burnley manager said.
 "There's way more support out there. I think players have got more belief in the system now, there's a deeper care and attention and understanding of the challenges.
 "I have nothing but admiration for players. I think it's an all-time high of demand."

On April Fools' Day this year, Lori Thomas and her family stuck a handful of "For Sale by Owners" signs in the yards of their neighbors, giving them a momentary shock, and then laughs, when they woke up that morning.
   
 Their Northwest Austin neighborhood is a tight-knit one. But another beloved spring tradition -- Easter -- is going to be a lot harder to celebrate in 2020.
   
 Normally, the neighborhood has Easter egg hunts in people's yards and other related activities. She said she was thinking of contact-free ways -- maybe sidewalk chalk art -- she could bring cheer to her Canyon Creek neighbors over the holiday. Inspirational chalk messages have become one way communities around the city can stay connected as everyone shelters in place.
   
 Heather Forshay's family, for their part, created giant poster board Easter eggs that they've hung in the front windows of their home, just down the street from the Thomases. They've noticed more people than usual are taking walks outside and want to give them a little extra joy, she said.
   
 Both families' Easter plans have been interrupted by the coronavirus pandemic, which has forced billions around the world to stay home. This weekend, Thomas, her husband, Kevin, and their two kids -- 13-year-old son Parker and 11-year- old daughter Riley -- would have driven with Thomas' 78-year-old mom to a small town outside of Houston to celebrate Easter with their extended family, as they have done every year.
   
 Almost two dozen people attend that Easter fish fry in East Bernard, all of them relatives from Thomas' mom's side of the family. The fish fry is always accompanied by games, including an adult Easter egg hunt (with money instead of candy or confetti) and a raw egg toss that Thomas and her husband tend to win. Inevitably, she said, at least one person ends up covered in goopy, sticky, raw egg.
   
 During the Easter egg hunts, 30-, 40- and 50-year-olds -- at 50, Thomas is the oldest of her half-dozen maternal cousins -- run around the yard, trying to find the one egg with $20 inside. If it makes noise when you shake it, you don't want it -- there's just a quarter inside.
   
 "We're kind of a goofy family. Lots of laughter and pranks," she said. "We have a lot of adult cousins, we all grew up around each other, and it's fun to pass on the traditions to our kids. I think we're modeling to them that you can be older and still have fun. You don't have to just sit in a chair and watch the kids; you can participate, too."
   
 This year will be a notably smaller gathering, though no less joyful. Just Thomas' immediate family will drive to Sun City, where her mom lives alone and hasn't seen anyone for roughly three weeks. She'll sit on her back deck 20 feet away and watch as Thomas, her husband and the two kids compete in a smaller-scale raw egg toss, fly a kite, make a craft and "have a good old- fashioned Easter egg hunt," she said.
   
 They also want to have a Zoom call with the other family members they can't be with this year -- including Thomas' brother, who works for an ad agency in Manhattan, one of the hardest-hit areas of the pandemic in the U.S. He's able to work from home, but venturing out to get groceries feels downright dangerous.
   
 "Thank God for technology," Thomas, a physical therapist who hasn't been working because of canceled elective surgeries, said more than once.
   
 The ability to connect virtually isn't lost on Forshay. She works for the nearby Hill Country Bible Church that both families attend. Since COVID-19 became widespread here, the church has been hosting Sunday service online and will do the same on Easter Sunday. Remarkably, she said, the livestreams have had higher numbers of viewers than there had been people coming in the door previously.
   
 On Sunday, her family plans to watch the Easter service and have a devotional at home, reflecting on the resurrection of Jesus Christ.
   
 Forshay's father also lives in Sun City. Usually, on Easter weekend, he makes a coconut Easter bunny cake and relatives from Fort Worth drive down to enjoy a day of good food and the requisite hunt for Easter eggs. (Lately, the eggs have been filled with quarters to motivate the teenagers.) Forshay and her husband, John, have a son, Ben, 18, and a daughter, Katie, 14. As a high school senior, Ben likely won't get to enjoy prom or graduation, but he's taking it in stride.
   
 The night before Easter, the Forshays and their relatives, which include her older brother and college-age nephews, will have their usual Easter dinner together -- virtually. Forshay said she set up her father on Zoom beforehand.
   
 "For the Zoom dinner, everyone is going to make what we have at the house rather than make a big meal," she said. "It's less about the food and more about all being together. We'll miss the coconut bunny cake, but you realize what is most important in these times."
   
 Forshay is particularly excited about late Easter morning, when the neighbors along her street in Canyon Creek plan to head to the end of their driveways or front stoops to greet each other, "saying good morning, happy Easter and all of that," she said. "We'll visit with triple the social distancing measures."
   
 If there's one good thing that has come out of staying almost exclusively at home, she said, it's that some people have the time now to evaluate the trajectory of their lives -- and what better time than Easter to make those changes?
   
 "We have the space now to cultivate what's important," she said. "With the families (the church) is involved with, I see fathers and sons reconnect. Families renew game night. Board games come out. We've lived in our neighborhood for a while, and I've never seen so many people out and about, walking and riding bikes. I think that's phenomenal. The space allows people to go deep and ask, 'What am I supposed to be doing with my life?' I think we'll see more of that spiritual shift in the weeks and months to come."

Monaco have denied the claim that club owner and president Dmitry Rybolovlev allegedly stands to receive €124million from Kylian Mbappe's transfer to Paris Saint-Germain, as reported by Mediapart, the online investigative journal in France.
 Mediapart's report is based on documents it claims to have received from whistleblowing platform 'Football Leaks', though Monaco have branded it "misleading".
 According to the French news outlet, sums of €77m and €47m from the €145m Monaco obtained from PSG for Mbappe were allegedly designated for Rybolovlev in July 2018 and June 2019 respectively.
 Monaco have strenuously refuted the allegation, insisting that although the funds are recoverable for the president due to previous investments he has written off, Rybolovlev has not withdrawn anything from the club's coffers.
 A statement from the club read: "AS Monaco firmly denies defamatory remarks by Mediapart and states that club president Dmitry Rybolovlev did not withdraw one euro from the club's accounts following the transfer of Kylian Mbappe.
 "President Dmitry Rybolovlev has invested nearly 335 million euros since his arrival to fund transfers and player salaries and pay off the club's debts.
 "Each season since his arrival, the club has regularly suffered financial losses. Dmitry Rybolovlev has, whenever necessary and in the interest of the club, played his role as shareholder and compensated for the deficits. Thus, of the 335 million euros invested, 182 million euros made it possible to fill these deficits recorded as of June 30, 2017.
 "In accounting, these transactions are called current account write-offs, and they allow the shareholder to abandon part of his current account investments and advances for cash-flow situations. In return, in order to guarantee the legitimate rights of the shareholder, these current account withdrawals are always accompanied by a return to better fortune clause.
 "During the 2017-18 season, with the club having made a profit, this clause of better fortune could be naturally activated. In the context of the application of this clause, the sums concerned are no longer considered as 'abandoned' by the shareholder and become recoverable but remain in the club's accounts.
 "As a result, Dmitry Rybolovlev did not recover, on a personal basis, a single cent of these sums of money, neither on the transfer of Kylian Mbappe nor on any other money entry into the club.
 "The current account of the shareholder is used for the operation of the club and transfers.
 "AS Monaco, which can obviously provide the accounting evidence to completely contradict the misleading allegations of Mediapart, is surprised that among the hundreds of questions received from journalists at the time they were conducting their 'investigation', not one precise question on this specific topic had been asked, and the club is now studying all the legal means to assert his rights."

While the COVID-19 pandemic has pushed classes to an online format for BGSU, the Starship robots are continuing to deliver food across campus and still need to be loaded and maintained. After what began as a stressful initiation of the robot delivery service, BGSU Dining employees will have to wait until next semester to see how food locations adjust to the bots.
 Vice president of Starship’s public relations agency Janel Steinberg noted the importance of Starship to the campus community and students in need of jobs.
 “In most cases, the services we are offering never existed in the locations we are now serving. We’re proud to be able to create new jobs and help people gain experience in technology that will be part of our lives in the years to come,” Steinberg said.
 Starship is committed to serving the community, both with new jobs and access to campus food.
 In a BG Falcon Media interview, Starship Launch Manager Hanna Sippos said students would be operating the robots as hybrid operators.
 One of the hybrid operators is junior public relations major Reid Zura, who pointed out the popularity of the robots. He said due to popularity, Starship was able to double its fleet and hire more students to care for the robots.
 With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, there’s been an increase in jobs for students, that has provided work for those who would otherwise be struggling. Director of Marketing and Communications for BGSU Dining Jon Zachrich said more jobs will be needed soon. The more open positions means more jobs for students in need of a source of income after the pandemic.
 “Once things go back to ‘normal’ on campus, I think that more positions will be needed as the popularity grows,” he said.
 BGSU Dining has had to hire more employees to help accommodate for the popularity of the food delivery itself. Zachrich noted Starship has created the position of “robot handler.” The responsibility of this position is to get the order information, make or pick up the order from the restaurant, put the order in the robot and then send it to the customer.
 “In BGSU Dining, the ‘robot handlers’ were positions whose responsibility was to handle orders from start to finish at various locations,” Zachrich said.
 However, Paige Broka, an on-campus worker in the Falcon’s Nest, said she believed the robots were unnecessary.
 “I do not think they handled the oncoming of the robots well, because they were understaffed in all aspects: food service workers and robot runners,” she said.
 It was introduced overnight to the campus workers, which caused confusion and stress, Broka said.
 Victoria Cline, an on-campus worker at Starbucks, claims the robots are efficient, but preparing food and drinks was the challenge. Starbucks was the first business on-campus to offer the delivery system, as workers were given only a couple days notice the robot delivery system was going to start in the coming week.
 “I have had to remake many orders and sometimes there are duplicates or the orders are lengthy on top of other drinks, but overall, I did not mind it after warming up to it,” Cline said.
 The workers had to learn the flow and the system the robots run on in a short amount of time to get things on track.
 Raeann Barnes, an on-campus worker, thought the robots were going to be cool, but on launch day discovered how underprepared the staff was. The orders constantly came in, making it difficult for the staff.
 “They made it a lot more stressful. My staff was not happy. … A lot of problems arose, understanding the flow was difficult and it made our space seem so much smaller,” Barnes said.
 Cline said it made her co-workers stressed out and agitated, which rubbed off on others. Broka said it was especially difficult when there was an after- class rush.
 “Starbucks already has a very busy schedule, knowing extra orders would come in often was hard and we had no say,” said Cline.
 Then BGSU Dining started to make more hires in order to keep up with the demand of the robots.
 “We had to add over twenty shifts to our schedule. We hired robot runners who were actually very quick to pick up the gist of the job. It was starting to feel normal again,” Barnes said.
 She was excited to see how the robots would progress further and how it would affect her work. However, the campus only got a few weeks to work with them, COVID-19 moving students off-campus and into online classes.
 Barnes said the initial launch was done poorly; Cline and Broka were in agreement about the launch.
 “I just feel that we weren’t prepared at all to take on the Starship robots quite yet,” Broka said.
 When someone orders from the Starship app, it is the responsibility of the robot handlers to ensure food is delivered to the customer. Robot handlers help to make the transition from restaurant to dorm more efficient and safer for students on campus.
 “The robots are cleaned multiple times a day and are inspected by the student employees. General wear and tear happens which is maintained by a support employee,” Zura said.
 These support employees are essential for ensuring the robot fleet remains up and running.

NEW YORK (AP) — Steve Baker, one of the British parliament's leading libertarians, was nearly in tears as he addressed the House of Commons in support of a bill that once seemed unthinkable: a massive economic aid package in response to the coronavirus pandemic.
 “Libertarian though I may be, this is the right thing to do but, my goodness, we ought not to allow this situation to endure one moment longer than is absolutely necessary to save lives and preserve jobs," he said last month. “We are implementing tonight in this bill at least a dystopian society.”
 Libertarian principles of self-reliance and minimal government have been around for centuries. But they are being tested as never before in a time when much of the world, and many of their adherents, see a clear role for government restriction on basic liberties.

After the cold and dreary months of winter, I am always eager for spring and to decorate for the Easter season. For me, celebrating Easter and the joys of spring go hand in hand.      Once you make the decision to set a formal or informal table, then the fun can begin. We've become a disposable society where paper plates, cups and napkins are the norm for family gatherings. Consider using the opportunity to take out the fine china, crystal and flatware. If you don't own fine china, but would like to start your own collection, visit estate sales or antique malls. While you're searching for these goodies, keep your eyes open for ceramic bunnies, chicks and lambs. Vintage tablecloths, napkins and candle holders are often found for great prices.      For a semi-formal place setting, I have often used wicker chargers. Dollar stores offer so many unique items to "fill in the gaps" on the table. Consider small vine bird's nests, tiny Easter eggs to fill small baskets at each place setting and holiday-themed salt and pepper shakers. Fresh flowers are always appropriate to herald the arrival of spring!      For fun and informal meals, vibrant Fiestaware plates always bring compliments from my guests. If you don't want to purchase an entire set of dishes, neighborhood yard sales and estate sales are your friends. The best part of using Fiestaware (besides its bright colors) is the ease of mixing and matching. I've used pink, purple, robin's egg blue, green, orange and yellow all together for an Easter egg color-themed table.      If room allows, have a separate "kids' table." Children love the bright colors and, again, the dollar stores are a treasure trove of goodies for setting the perfect table for your youngest guests. Vinyl tablecloths that can be easily cleaned are perfect for the inevitable spills and drips. Melamine plates are suitable for the kids, along with plastic cups or glasses. Consider filling a large basket with plastic Easter eggs as your centerpiece. If time allows before the meal, let the kids decorate their own boiled and dyed egg to use as their place setting marker.      Don't forget about the serving pieces. Silver trays, vintage egg plates for stuffed eggs, cabbage shaped bowls for coleslaw and platters with a carrot motif all contribute to the beauty of your Easter table. Plan ahead and visit your local hobby or department stores the days after Easter. You'll find great bargains for next spring's family table.

FRISCO, Texas (AP) — The Dallas Cowboys have signed former XFL player Saivion Smith. The addition of the cornerback came shortly after the XFL announced it was suspending operations and laying off its employees. Smith played for Houston, which was the only undefeated team in the XFL when the season was stopped after five games because of the new coronavirus outbreak. Smith led Alabama with three interceptions in 2018. He signed with Jacksonville as an undrafted free agent last year but was waived before the season.UNDATED (AP) — First-year college football coaches have been put even further behind because of the shutdowns caused by the coronavirus pandemic.

It wasn't clear whether trainer Bobby Martinez will appeal. The commission is proposing fines totaling $480,000 and Martinez would not be able to apply for a state license until 2054. Any horses owned or trained by Martinez also would be ineligible to race in New Mexico.LOS ANGELES (AP) — A person familiar with the deal says the Los Angeles Rams are trading receiver Brandin Cooks to the Houston Texans.

LONDON -- Britain has not yet reached the COVID-19 peak which would allow for an easing of tight restrictions of movement, health minister Matt Hancock said on Saturday.
 The death toll in British hospitals has reached almost 9,000, with 980 more deaths reported on Friday, a figure which exceeded the deadliest day so far in Italy, the country worst hit by the virus.
 Among those who have been infected is Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who is recovering in hospital after spending three nights in intensive care. His office said he was improving and was back on his feet although his recovery was still at an early stage.
 Britain imposed a lockdown three weeks ago in a bid to curb the spread of the virus and the government has come under increasing pressure to detail how long the strict measures on movements would last, with people forced to stay at home and many businesses unable to operate.
 Ministers have said Britain needed to pass the peak of the outbreak before changes could be made, and Hancock said although the number of hospital admissions had started to flatten out, there was not enough evidence yet to have confidence they were past the worst.
 "Our judgment is we're not there yet. We haven't seen a flattening enough to be able to say that we've reached the peak," he told BBC radio.
 Some scientists have suggested the peak might still be some weeks off but Hancock said "nobody knows" when it would be.
 "There's all sorts of suggestions. Their job is to make their best estimate and advise us and we have a whole load of different pieces of advice from different scientists," he said.
 The death rate is also expected to increase over the next few days, health officials have cautioned, but they say they are hopeful that the lockdown will mean that the overall number of deaths will be below 20,000.
 Initially Johnson took a more modest response to the outbreak than other European leaders but changed tack when projections suggested a quarter of a million people could die in the United Kingdom.
 The government has come under fire for its initial response and a lack of preparedness, and there was criticism on Saturday from doctors and nurses who said they were having to treat patients without proper personal protective equipment (PPE) such as masks and gloves.
 Among those to have died after testing positive for COVID-19 are 19 health care workers including 11 doctors.
 The British Medical Association, which represents doctors, said medics were facing a "heart-breaking" decision over whether to treat patients without proper protection and so put themselves at risk.
 "No doctor should ever have to be in harm's way when they go to work, and in these unprecedented times, this has never been more important," said Dr Chaand Nagpaul, the BMA council chair.
 The Royal College of Nursing said it was getting calls about shortages, saying some staff were "petrified."
 Hancock said 761 million PPE items had been delivered to the 1.4 million staff who worked for the National Health Service but there were issues in ensuring in reached the frontline.
 "There's clearly more to do to make sure every single person who needs it gets the PPE that they need," he said. (Reporting by Michael Holden, Editing by William Maclean)

"Il turismo, che in Italia e in Sicilia è il traino dell'economia, sta soffrendo. Hotel, B&B, Case Vacanza non solo sono vuoti da un mese, ma stanno arrivando tutte le disdette delle prenotazioni di aprile, maggio e giugno 2020. Il blocco degli spostamenti per l'emergenza Covid-19 ha reso impossibile ogni viaggio, mentre le attività alberghiere e ricettive sono state costrette a chiudere e sospendere la stagione. In Italia il turismo rappresenta circa il 13% del Pil nazionale e offre lavoro a 3.5 milioni di lavoratori, equivalenti al 15% della forza lavoro nazionale. Auspico che la deputazione nazionale e regionale si impegni seriamente nell'assistenza agli operatori e propongano adeguate misure risolutive, al fine di ottenere il sostegno economico, equiparato a tutti gli altri settori economici coinvolti e anche essi allo stremo e in difficoltà.

The official line is patience with measures that have shown success in slowing the virus spread, until there is a clear decline in the number of new cases. Still, officials have begun grappling with the question of how to manage social distancing on mass transit, re-open ordinary commerce and relaunch manufacturing without risking another peak.
 The so-called Phase II is being described as a cautious reopening, as society continues to live alongside the virus until a vaccine can be developed, perhaps in 12 to 18 months.
 ‘’We obviously don’t want to delude ourselves that everything will change,’’ Premier Giuseppe Conte told Italians this week.
 On Friday, Conte extended the nationwide lockdown through May 3. That includes all nonessential industry, after which, ‘’I hope we can start again with caution and gradually — but restart,'' he said.
 A technical committee advising the government is working to expand testing for COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus. to get a better picture of how widespread it is in Italy before measures can be eased. Preparations are also underway to launch a mobile app that will allow people to know if they have been near anyone who is positive, something that is expected to take at least a month.
 ‘’With this you can allow people to have more freedom of movement,’’ said Walter Ricciardi, a public health expert and member of the World Health Organization board advising the Italian government.
 The technology for the app already exists but authorities were working on technical details on how to deploy it.
 Experts in Italy are coordinating with their European partners so the tracking can be applied across borders, which have been de facto closed by the virus. The goal is to establish a common technology, which could help in re- establishing freedom of movement between EU nations.
 Using the app would be voluntary for anyone wanting to know whether they have come into contact with an infected person that they would have no other way of identifying. Any contacts would be tested, and if positive treated, according to the WHO initiative: trace, test and treat.
 Advocates insist that anonymity would be protected and that no personal data would be at risk, likening the app to other widely used applications like Google Maps or TripAdvisor, which help users identify specific data.

Call it a premonition, or perhaps the unwavering support a loving uncle has for his nephew: in either case, it was a prediction that rang true with the conclusion of the 2020 Class AA wrestling season in West Virginia. Frazier finished the season undefeated and captured the state title in the 285 pound weight class for the fourth consecutive year.
 With the win, Frazier becomes the first wrestler in the Fairmont Senior program — which has a storied history with 62 state champions, fourth-most in West Virginia state history — to capture four individual state championships. He also finished his career with an overall record of 159-2, which places him third in program history and total wins and earned him the best career winning percentage record (.988) in Marion County history.
 For his impeccable senior season performance — which serves as a proper swan song to what many regard as the best career in Fairmont Senior program and one of the greatest in West Virginia state history — Frazier has been named the 2019-20 Times West Virginian Wrestler of the Year, honoring the top prep wrestler in Marion County.
 “He wrestled really well his senior year. I mean, it was expected, and he had a few dogfight matches, but he wrestled well and did what he does best. I’m very proud of him, but he pretty much did what was expected. I’m not surprised by this, he’s the best that’s ever come through the school,” Delligatti said.
 “That’s an amazing honor — thank you guys for that, it feels really special. It’s definitely a good way to go out,” Frazier said.

Mario Mandzukic's 59th-minute winner earned Juventus a 1-0 victory over Valencia that ensured they booked their place in the knockout rounds.
 The Bianconeri were stunned by Manchester United in Turin during their last group game but sealed their place in the last 16 with one game to spare on Tuesday, with Group H top spot now up for grabs on matchday six.
 In a game of few chances, Mandzukic scored a tap-in in the second half after Cristiano Ronaldo had worked space to steer a cross to the Croatian striker.
 United's last-gasp win over Young Boys means Valencia can no longer reach the last 16 even if they beat Mourinho's side at home in their final group game.
 Juventus had been awarded two penalties in the reverse fixture with Valencia but Miralem Pjanic, the scorer of both of those spot-kicks, was denied another in the first half when he claimed he was pulled back by Geoffrey Kondogbia.
 The Bianconeri dominated possession but struggled to conjure up chances and Joao Cancelo's outside-of-the-foot effort that went wide was as close as they came to a first-half goal.
 It was Valencia who almost took the lead on the stroke of half-time, but Wojciech Sczcesny's brilliant one-hand save repelled Mouctar Diakhaby's header from a corner.
 Juventus continued to look short of ideas until Ronaldo's moment of magic just before the hour mark.
 The Portugal forward's stepover fooled Gabriel and gave him enough space to steer across a ball that Mandzukic turned home from close range.
 Valencia thought they had hit straight back when Diakhaby got a touch to Dani Parejo's near-post free-kick.
 However, the ball had clearly struck the defender's outstretched arm and rather than being credited with an equaliser, Diakhaby was punished with a yellow card from referee Willie Collum.
 Neto denied Paulo Dybala, Ronaldo and Mandzukic a second Juve goal, but Valencia never looked like getting an equaliser at the other end as they exited the competition.

This is not just a joke taken too far but goes to show how Nwogwugwu has made himself available to be used to disrespect the Office of the Number One citizen of Imo State.      Anyone who sparred time to read through the trash would readily appreciate that was Nwogwugwu not on a voyage of mischief, malice, slander and deliberate falsehood, he would have sparred a thought to cross check what obviously is a porpcon gist from his imaginary source.      Definitely, Nwogwugwu' s employers have set him on suicide mission without him knowing. He thinks he is impressing them, but he needs be told how hugely he is damaging his youthful age and energy by deferring to things that will haunt him throughout his life journey except he does a quick detour.      Going forward, Governor Uzodimma will not shy away from giving Nwogwugwu the opportunity to defend his posts on Facebook as they concern him and his Office and hopes Nwogwugwu will not see that as abuse of his human right.      It beats the imagination that Nwogwugwu and his likes seem not to know that the governor is protected under the same human rights laws.   It is even more worrisome that they are yet to come to terms with the global campaign against fake news and the efforts being made to check the menace.

North Carolina State signee Josh Hall will participate in the NBA Draft evaluation process while retaining his college eligibility.
   
 Hall is rated in recruiting rankings as a consensus four-star forward for Moravian Prep in Hickory, where he completed a post-graduate year this season. He signed his national letter of intent with the Wolfpack in November.
   
 Per NBA rules, Hall, who is from Durham, is eligible for the draft because he is a year removed from his high school graduation class.
       Get the news delivered to your inbox: Sign up for our daily newsletters     
 "I would like to thank Coach (Kevin) Keatts and the entire North Carolina State community for welcoming me in with open arms and believing in me," Hall wrote in a Twitter post. "The NBA has always been a huge dream of mine, gaining experience at the highest level there is and competing against the best. With all that being said, I will be going through the NBA Draft process while keeping my college eligibility."
   
 The 6-foot-9 Hall is the top-rated recruit among N.C. State's five-man incoming class for next season, which is ranked eighth nationally and third in the Atlantic Coast Conference, according to 247Sports composite rankings. He is listed as the No. 2 prospect in North Carolina and a top 50 player in the country in those rankings.
   
 Hall's Moravian Prep squad played at The Burlington School in December, defeating the Spartans by a 79-63 score with Hall providing 20 points.
   
 N.C. State was in a similar situation a year ago when Jalen Lecque, a four- star guard and the Wolfpack's highest-rated signee among its 2019 recruiting class, decided to take part in the NBA Draft evaluation process.
   
 Lecque elected to keep his name in the draft rather than enrolling at N.C. State. He went undrafted but later signed a four-year contract, including two years guaranteed, with the Phoenix Suns. As a rookie, Lecque has played in 33 games for the Northern Arizona Suns of the G-League, the NBA's developmental league, and has been recalled on multiple occasions by Phoenix. He has played in a total of four NBA games.
   
 Keatts said last month that current Wolfpack juniors Devon Daniels and D.J. Funderburk plan to take part in the NBA Draft process while keeping the option to return to N.C. State for next season.
   
 The NCAA deadline to withdraw from the NBA Draft and maintain college eligibility is June 3. This year's draft is scheduled for June 25.

 It took a child to make them see they were missing out on a God-given opportunity to extend compassion.
 When they suddenly began practicing the Golden Rule, they discovered the real worth of a man whom they now saw as a gift, not a burden.
 Practicing compassion invades our comfort zone. It will mean we have to go out of our way or go out on a limb to help someone else.
 It’s not always convenient to practice compassion.
 We may need to give up time we’d rather spend doing something else.
 Compassion also involves risk. The person we’re trying to help may not be as appreciative as the man in the Bible story.
 I’ve learned to pray that God will help me see with His eyes and respond with His heart.
 He directs me to situations not always pleasant and where I often feel inadequate.
 Yet, when I’ve followed His cues, I’ve seen Him rescue and restore people as only God can do.
 I’m so thankful He has shown so much compassion for me that He would consider using me to be His hands, feet, eyes, ears and heart to reach people I would otherwise leave by the wayside.

If social distancing is the norm for the foreseeable future, then we must face the facts; there are just so many things a human being can do confined inside a house alone, or with his/her partner, and only so many things a human can do outside the home without coming in contact with other humans.
 Everything we hear today says refrain from social contact. That's easier said than done. It's not within our nature to lock ourselves away or shun social interaction. Moreover, the sheer size of the world population makes not encountering someone impossible. That is, unless you live in some remote cabin in Alaska, or in an igloo at the North Pole, even Antarctica, or perhaps a thatched hut on some deserted island somewhere in the South Pacific wearing vegetation for clothing.
 Consider for a moment that at the dawn of agriculture, about 8000 B.C., the population of the world was approximately 5 million. Then, over the next 8,000 years up to 1 A.D., the population grew to 200 million. After the industrial revolution, a tremendous change occurred. Whereas, it had taken all of human history until around 1800 for the world population to reach one billion, the second billion was achieved in only 130 years (1930), the third billion in 30 years (1960), the fourth billion in 15 years (1974), and the fifth billion in only 13 years (1987).
 On March 20, 2020, the world population stood at 7,772,166,446 and counting, and on the same day, there were 171,347 births, 71,949 deaths and the population grew another 99,398. Good heaven, that's almost 50 percent of the population of Cape Cod, in only one day.
 These are the questions I ask myself. After you do a four-mile walk, or take a hike, ride a bike on the rail trail, play a round of golf, but only one at a time allowed on the tees and greens, and drive by the beach and watch the surf, what else is there to do outside during the Cape's early spring?
 We even had our hike through the dunes of Provincetown canceled by the Harwich Conservation Trust.
 Now I ask you, what about inside? How many books can you read before you go bug eyed? How many puzzles can an individual put together before you go stir crazy? How long can you sit in front of a TV binge watching Peaky Blinders? How many card games can a person play with his or her partner before you get on each other's nerves? How many cakes and cookies can someone bake without gaining weight?
 And, how many times can I watch Steve Harvey and Family Feud before Steve and his screaming contestants drive me nuts? Finally, you know you're bored when you plan your evening dinner chopping onions, carrots, celery and garlic at 9:30 in the morning because that's all there is to do and the excitement for the day is, what can we make for dinner?
 The next time someone asks what are you making for dinner I'd much rather say, "Reservations."
 We are explorers, and we get itchy when cooped up inside. However, we are also responsible, we listen to the experts and we do our part by staying home to protect ourselves and others around us. So goes these times we live in.
 Aristotle was right. "Man is by nature a social animal; an individual who is unsocial naturally and not accidentally is either beneath our notice or more than human. Society is something that precedes the individual. Anyone who either cannot lead the common life or is so self-sufficient as not to need to, and therefore does not partake of society, is either a beast or a god."
 Stay safe, remain healthy and continue practicing social distancing.
 Together, we will see this through.

England manager Gareth Southgate has told his team not to worry about permutations of the Nations League ahead of Sunday's decider with Croatia.
 Both sides played out a goalless draw last month in the reverse fixture behind closed doors in Rijeka, but Croatia's last-gasp win against Spain on Thursday means all three teams could still be promoted from Group 4 of League A going into the final match.
 A win for England or Croatia would guarantee promotion and a place in the finals of the new competition, while defeat or a draw could relegate both teams depending on the score.
 The Three Lions suffered a heartbreaking extra-time defeat to Croatia in the semi-finals of the World Cup and Southgate says he will not leave anything to chance at Wembley.
 "It's dead simple, really, we just go for it," he told reporters.
 "There's no point in hedging our bets that we might do this, we might do that or we need a 0-0.
 "We have a chance to get through a really strong group, so for me we just focus on going for the win."
 Southgate is pleased with the way his young side has progressed and believes the standard of the post-World Cup fixtures have aided their development.
 "We want to achieve consistent performances and continue to improve and learn as a team and these Nations League games have given us a really good test," he said.
 "It is unprecedented that you come off the back of a major tournament and have so many strong tests in such a short period.
 "It's been really good for us as a way of learning and improving with and without the ball and gaining some belief. We are pleased with progress and we want to finish well."

LaLiga president Javier Tebas has accused Paris Saint-Germain and Manchester City of "cheating" and called for the Ligue 1 giants to be banned from the Champions League.
 PSG and City both found their financial practices under the microscope earlier this month following a series of articles by Der Spiegel and MediaPart, drawing on documents purportedly obtained by whistleblowers Football Leaks that claimed each club had broken rules by attempting to circumvent UEFA's Financial Fair Play (FFP) laws.
 Premier League champions City declined to comment on the allegations, adding that "the attempt to damage the club's reputation is organised and clear".
 PSG maintained that they have "always acted in absolute compliance with the laws and regulations issued by sports institutions".
 Both clubs have not responded to a request from Omnisport for further comment with regards to the latest observations from Tebas, who dismissed their protestations and urged UEFA to take action.
 "I said two years ago that PSG and Manchester City were cheating so it wasn't a surprise to me at all," he told Goal at Soccerex in Miami.
 "It's very important that UEFA does something real about it. It's something that has unbalanced world football and the structure of the game. You have to punish those teams."
 Tebas feels a season-long ban from the Champions League for PSG would be a welcome show of strength from UEFA.
 "Forcing them to sit out a year of the Champions League would send a message that these rules must be taken seriously," he said.
 "It isn't about punishing PSG specifically, but enforcing rules we expect everyone to follow."
 City and PSG reached settlements with the UEFA Club Financial Control Body in May 2014 after they breached FFP regulations.
 Along with €60million fines and spending caps for the 2014-15 season, the clubs could only name 21 players in their Champions League squads that campaign. City had two thirds of their fine refunded in April 2017.
 One of the Der Spiegel revelations was that then-UEFA general secretary Gianni Infantino worked with the clubs to agree favourable terms.
 Infantino is now president of FIFA and has defended his conduct at the time.
 "Our goal at UEFA was always to keep the clubs with us, not to kick them out, so you negotiate and seek solutions. That was my job as general secretary," he told Swiss publication Blick.
 "The fact is, in the history of FFP, 30 violations have been detected. With all but one club there were agreements - agreements and negotiations are expressly allowed."
 Speaking two weeks ago amid Der Spiegel's series of articles, City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters he expected his club to be punished if they were found to have violated UEFA rules.
 "I trust a lot the club and I know the people [on the City board]," he said. "If there's something wrong, we'll be punished. FIFA or UEFA have to say if we were wrong. If we were wrong, we accept it."

Shaker Pines Fire Chief Charles Macsata said the decision to expand the fire station was born out of necessity and concern about safety.
 Macsata said the addition on the north of the building will be split into a training room for meetings and a gymnasium to be used solely by firefighters for exercise and training. Both will be bigger than the corresponding spaces in the existing building.
 The addition on the building’s west side will be used as a decontamination area, Steele said. Macsata said that area is being created in an attempt to reduce firefighters’ risk of cancer.
 Firefighters are at increased risk of cancer because they are exposed to cancer-causing agents released when materials burn.
 When firefighters come back from a fire, they will use water to wash the soot off their gear, Macsata said. If the carcinogens are left on the gear, the toxins can be absorbed into the skin and cause cancer down the road, he explained.
 Commission member Charles Ladd asked where the runoff from the decontamination area will go. He expressed concern about having hazardous chemicals entering the water supply and potentially affecting wetlands in the area.
 Macsata said the runoff will go into the sewer, and from there to the water treatment plant.

Meghalaya Assembly Speaker Metbah Lyngdoh on Friday wrote to Chief Minister ConradSangma, urging him to extend the lockdown period till April 30, as the number of COVID-19 cases have been rising in thecountry.
 Though no such case has been reported from the stateso far, the government should continue with the existingmeasures to tackle the crisis by end of the current month sothat Meghalaya remains free of COVID-19, he said.
 "There are increasing number of COVID-19 patients inthe country. It is worrisome. I have written to the chiefminister to consider extension of the lockdown period tillApril end," Metbah told .
 The speaker, who is also the president of the UnitedDemocratic Party, a partner of the Meghalaya DemocraticAlliance government, said big markets such as Iewduh, Jowaiand Tura should be closed for the time being.
 "Only small local markets where social distancingprotocols can be maintained may be allowed to startfunctioning after the ongoing lockdown period is over," hesaid.
 Deputy Chief Minister Prestone Tynsong hinted that thecabinet will meet early next week to decide on the matter.
 While NREGA and construction works have been allowedto resume, but no workers from outside the state will be givenpermission to enter Meghalaya.
 "All entry and exit points of the state will remainclosed during the lockdown with restrictions on inter-district movements," a government official said.
 The speaker emphasised on carrying out sanitisationexercise at the checkpoints so that vehicles ferryingessential commodities are sanitised properly.
 Lyngdoh also urged the government to strengthen thelogistics facilities for transporting agricultural produce offarmers of the state.
 He appealed to the government to monitor the prices ofessential commodities in the state

But without substantial federal funding, states’ efforts will only go so far.

The confirmation of Yemen's first coronavirus case "makes it even more imperative to stop the fighting immediately", Griffiths said in a statement.
 \- Renewed clashes' - Members of the UN Security Council on Friday welcomed the Saudi-led coalition's unilateral ceasefire, which began on Thursday, and the Yemen government's "positive response".
 They called on the Huthi rebels to make "similar commitments without delay".
 The pleas appeared to fall on deaf ears.
 Yemeni pro-government forces and Huthi rebels reported several air raids in the northern districts of Al-Jawf and Hajjah.
 The coalition raids "targeted Huthi vehicles after they rejected the ceasefire and were attempting to attack government positions", a pro-government source told AFP.
 The source also reported ongoing clashes between pro-government loyalists and the rebels in Al-Jawf and the Marib, northern regions which have seen intense fighting since the beginning of the year.
 There was no immediate comment from the coalition.
 The military alliance said its ceasefire was aimed at helping efforts to prevent a COVID-19 outbreak in Yemen.
 The move was welcomed by the United States but dismissed by the Huthi rebels, who charged that the continued coalition air strikes showed the announcement was a public relations stunt.
 "We consider the ceasefire a political and media manoeuvre," Huthi spokesman Mohamed Abdelsalam told Al Jazeera news network.
 The United Arab Emirates, a key Saudi ally, said that the battle against the coronavirus trumped all other concerns.
 "The COVID-19 crisis eclipses everything -- the international community must step up efforts & work together to protect the Yemeni people," UAE Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Anwar Gargash tweeted.
 UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres has repeatedly appealed for ceasefires in conflicts around the world to facilitate the battle against the coronavirus.
 Saudi Arabia is also scrambling to limit the spread of the disease at home. Its health ministry has reported more than 3,200 coronavirus infections and 44 deaths from the illness.

With most industries adopting work-from-home strategies and closing down their premises, the corporate catering business has taken a hit, and is seeking government support to tide over the crisis.
 “Corporate catering is a not a very high margin business. We work on some 5-6% margin and the cost is 95%. With the lockdown looking like it is going to be extended, we have to incur fixed costs like rent and electricity charges without any revenue generation,” said Narayanan Narayanan Director, Karaikudi Annalakshmi Commercial Kitchen Limited.
 The company has central kitchens in OMR Chennai and in Karaikudi , with 50% of its clients from IT companies and the remaining from other industries and a school.
 “We are also facing a chain reaction wherein our clients are not getting payments from their customers and in-turn they are not able to pay us,” Mr. Narayanan said. If the lockdown continues for an extended period of time, it will lead to unemployment and the need of the hour is protecting jobs and paying salaries, for which the government has to support the sector, he said.
 Mr. Narayanan pointed out the government has requested industries not to cut salaries, but that is not being strictly followed. And without cash-flow generation it would difficult for industries to pay salaries. He suggested that the State government could undertake to pay at least 50% of salaries of the industry for the next three months and can treat is as loan payable in the next 10 months at an appropriate interest rate. Or the government should defer the collection of rent and fixed electricity charges and loan payments without interest accumulation and direct banks to provide support for payment of salaries, Mr. Narayanan pointed out.
 K. Sridhar, Managing Director, Fusion Foods, said that things are looking uncertain with lockdown extension becoming inevitable. The company caters to industrial customers and educational institutions. He said that measures such as the government paying the Provident Fund contribution of employer and employees for establishments with up to 100 employees, where 90% of employees drawing less than ₹15,000 salary, should be extended to others as well, without restrictions.
