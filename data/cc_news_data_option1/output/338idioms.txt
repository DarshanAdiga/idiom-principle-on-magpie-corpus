So, you have finally made up your mind to do some strength training. The best way to go about it is, of course, to enrol in a gym. But if you are hard pressed for time, you can also start on your own in the relative comforts of your home. But for this, you have to first know where to start. This work out can seem intimidating for a beginner. But know that this is not as complicated as it looks. The right way to go about it is to start small. First, you must get yourself a pair of dumbbells. But if you don’t want to invest in this, you can always use any household item instead. Water bottles, books and bags of rice or wheat are good options. Of course, as will all fitness regimes, you must first consult a doctor if you have any underlying conditions. Once you have to go-ahead, you can start your strength training workout.

 The box called my name every time I passed by. I hadn't been able to look through the keepsakes Mom kept during their 56 years of marriage. It felt like I would be incredibly nosy if I opened the lid.
 I tried going through the memorabilia with Dad after we lost her, but he wouldn't have any part of it. When Dad moved into the nursing home, the box came home with me and has remained unopened since the last time Mom filed away a memory.
 Another snowstorm made me do it. I ran out of things to clean or cook, so I headed to the basement. Even though plenty of things needed to be done down there, I pulled out the box, pulled up a chair and spent the better part of an afternoon going through each item. From newspaper clippings to homemade cards from the grandkids, her love for her family was more apparent than I ever took the time to notice when she was with us.
 Mom wasn't the bubbly type. She didn't make over about much of anything and kept her feelings to herself. It was difficult to know if she was happy, sad or even angry. She kept her emotions at an even keel. She wasn't big on displaying love with hugs or kisses, but you could always count on her to be there when you needed someone, and even when you didn't think you did. There wasn't anything she owned she wouldn't give to you, except maybe for her glue gun and sewing machine.
 The box holds a timetable of her life, including her and Dad's baby books to birth announcements of all four of us kids and grandkids. Anything that was printed, and had been shared with her, about anyone she loved, she cut out and dated, with the names neatly underlined. This will be one of the things society will miss as we slowly lose the art of reading a printed newspaper, looking at printed pictures or receiving handwritten notes. Now we rely on technology to hold our memories, instead of a box.
 I never asked my parents how they met and fell in love. I learned part of their story from the many letters in the box, written by Dad to Mom, while he was in the service during World War II. He and Mom became friends while he worked in Grandpa's grocery store. When he was drafted, he left behind a good job, and apparently a good friend.
 Although I was only able to get one side of the story, through his letters, I was surprised to find out she was engaged to someone else, who had also been drafted, and she wanted Dad's opinion on whether or not she should marry the guy. She must have gotten her answer, which she probably knew all along, that Dad was as interested in her and she was in him.
 I don't know how long it took, after he returned home, before they declared their love to each other, although I have a feeling it didn't take long. As the dated letters neared his discharge, he began referring to her as \"cuddles.\"
 I'm glad I looked in the box, and even more delighted I know the beginning of their love story.

Fast forward to the 1980s and news reporting was firmly a career. Entry into the field without a college diploma was very rare. More and more, the folks who filled the media’s ranks were there to make a good living. Politics, if they ever had any, fell to career ambition. To succeed was to not make trouble, to go with the flow. In places like Washington DC and Sacramento, in order to get prime access to those in power, a journalist had to avoid not only controversy, but conviction. For some, this meant self censorship, however, for many a media member, the mores of the press were the mores of television: That is, what is good is what sells and what sells is what looks good. Dress up, show up, nod your head, get your picture, get your quote and pick up the paycheck. To have politics only gets in the way of the career so in order to succeed a reporter must either deny their politics or have none to begin with. After all, no one likes a troublemaker.

DOYLE DIETZ / CONTRIBUTING PHOTOGRAPHER Catawissa native Joe Faux checked taking a Southern gobbler off his bucket list last spring when he downed this 18-pound bird with a 10½-inch beard and 1¼-inch spurs while hunting at Fair Game Outfitters near Castalia, N.C.

Located to the west of Interstate 95, hunting the woods and fields that comprise the 5,000-plus acres of leased land at Fair Game Outfitters will remind Pennsylvania turkey hunters of home. There is one major difference, however, in that other hunters will be neither seen nor heard when working a gobbler.

Bastano un Qr code, percorsi tattili, un video con il linguaggio Lys e cortesia, che è sempre un ottimo biglietto da visita , e anche visitatori con diverse abilità come non vedenti o sordi, possono apprezzare le tante attrattive della Città dei Sassi. Ne abbiamo avuto contezza assistendo all'arrivo, presso la casagrotta del Casalnuovo, di una piccola comitiva di non vedenti, accolti da Pietro Colapietro "arcinoto artigiano della ceramica sonora" che ha recuperato e allestito con tanta pazienza e non pochi sacrifici quegli ambienti e da Luca Petruzzellis, guida turistica, tra i 'pionieri' di un turismo alternativo, se vogliamo di nicchia, che pone attenzione verso fasce di turisti che hanno particolare esigenze di mobilità. E cosi dopo il saluto di 'Benvenuti!' la dimostrazione pratica, è già all'ingresso, come la tecnologia possa far superare non poche barriere fisiche e culturali. Sul pannello della "mobilità sostenibile" e con l'ausilio di letture tattili e di un Qr code attivato con il telefonino è possibile, per quanti hanno limiti visivi ascoltare quanto c'è da visitare, raggiungendo gli ambienti espositivi che rappresentano vari momenti della casa e della vita contadina: dal focolare, alla camera da letto fino alla cantina -stalla. Ci sono i corrimano, le asperità del pavimento sono state livellate e altri accorgimenti si stanno realizzando perchè Pietro e Luca fanno di esperienza virtù…annotando gli eventuali suggerimenti dei visitatori. E' l'altra frontiera del turismo e a tutti deve essere consentito di visitare Matera, con le dovute facilitazioni di accessibilità. Luca ci parla di quanto hanno fatto a Tenerife (Spagna) dove le "barriere" sono state abolite in tutti i sensi e per tutte le fasce di visitatori. A Matera, pochi, non mancano i buoni esempi. C'è solo da rimboccarsi le maniche e intervenire laddove occorre. Se nei rioni Sassi la pavimentazione è sconnessa a causa di danneggiamenti o scarsa manutenzione o al piano ci sono barriere su scivoli, percorsi tattili, perchè occupati da fioriere o veicoli che bloccano o limitano gli accessi e allora serve darsi una mossa. Magari toccando gli indisciplinati nell'affetto più caro, il portafogli…

Seeking out a family friend at the Pennsylvania Outdoor Writers Association booth for advice, Faux got an unexpected bonus when his friend told him he had booked a hunt at Fair Game Outfitters near Castalia, North Carolina. Extending an invitation to join him on the hunt, his friend introduced him to lodge owner Greg Schrider, and the deal was done.

“Like us,” you say. “What about the media elite?” Well, if by “media elite” you are referring to Sam Donaldson, Connie Chung, and Dan Rather, then I suggest you examine what makes them elite. Are the Rathers of the media elite because they are so much smarter than the rest of us? Is it because they possess oodles of secret knowledge? No, the media elite is elite for the same reason the entertainment elite is elite or the corporate elite is elite or the sports elite is elite or the “I can drink you under the table” elite is elite: For one reason or another, they are at the top of their profession. Because they are at the top, they have a status that the rest of us do not have. For the media, entertainment, corporate and sports elite, that means they have more money. The alcoholic elite have more damaged livers.
