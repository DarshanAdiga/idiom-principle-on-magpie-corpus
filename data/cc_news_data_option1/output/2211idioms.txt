If Minneapolis is actually serious about dismantling law enforcement, though, they won't like the end result. Rather than having a professional force in place to keep the peace, residents will have to take that into their own hands. Gun sales will go through the roof, and suddenly Minneapolis will have a lot more uses of lethal force on their hands, this time by frightened citizens who know help will  _never  _be on the way. Do they really expect _better_ outcomes from that environment?

  "I don‚Äôt know, maybe more time. It‚Äôs true that Mourinho‚Äôs Chelsea were impeccable, but that first year we had an amazing squad, with Di Mar√≠a, Falcao, Van Persie, Rooney, Antonio Valencia," he said.

"Part of the discipline that existed in our schools was a spin-off from the Catholic ethos and what the religious sisters, brothers and priests embodied with respect to how they approach engaging the students academically, socially with respect to their development. In recent times, and I don't know if they go hand in hand, we are experiencing more challenges with respect to discipline and order in schools and in society," he said, adding that a study could be done to see if there is a correlation and determine whether the society has changed with respect to values or whether it has to do with the limited religious presence in our schools.

Due to COVID-19 and church limitations, a Funeral Mass and Celebration of Life for Lorraine Claire Wolowicz (nee Molitor), age 87, will be held at a later date. She passed away on May 28, 2020. She was married to her beloved husband the late Joseph J. Wolowicz for 64 years. Her life was all about family, and she was blessed with a large one; husband the late Joseph, her loving children, Frank (Nancy) Wolowicz, Pam (Bill) Geen, Larry (Cathy) Wolowicz, Jerry (Pam) Wolowicz and Ken (Gina) Wolowicz, 14 very special grandchildren; Leanna (Chris) Rocks, Vicky (Ryan) Maher, Kim, Julie (Darnell) Holloway, Joe (Jackie) Geen, Elizabeth (Joe) Arttus, Laura (Jeret) Crook, Sarah (Jordan) Hollier, Dan (Lisa) Wolowicz, David (Megan) Wolowicz, Jackie (Troy) Olver, Kendall (Reed) Kaiser, Jonathan, and Anna, 22 loving great grandchildren; Patrick, Lauren, Megan, A.J., Abby, Jasmine, D.J., Morrison, Johnnie, Leo, Norah, Caroline, Henry, Patrick, Mary Claire, Peter, Tommy, Annie, Andrew, Halley, Jasper and Theo. Nothing made Lorraine happier than spending time with her family and celebrating both life's large and small moments, and there was nothing she wouldn't do for any of them. Lorraine was born in Chicago to the late Frank and Claire Molitor (nee Detloff). She was also preceded in death by her sister and best friend Geri (Dino) Moretti and her brother Ken (Fran) Molitor. Marriage to Joseph introduced Lorraine to the Wolowicz family, who welcomed her warmly, her late father and mother in law, Joe and Florence, sister-in-law Dolores and the late (Stan) Kijek, her late brother in law Rich (Arlene) Wolowicz, and her late sister in law Lorraine (Babe) and (Skip) Broderdorf. She grew up on the northwest side of Chicago in close proximity to numerous aunts, uncles and cousins and she enjoyed a very close relationship with her cousins throughout the years. It was at the old Skil Saw facility on Elston Avenue that Lorraine met the love of her life, Joe Wolowicz. The story goes that Joe had to be given a nudge by his boss to ask the pretty young lady in the key punch department for a date. He wisely followed the boss's advice, and the rest is history.      Joe and Lorraine started dating in 1950, were married in 1951, and had three children Frank, Pam and Larry, between 1952 and 1954. They moved from Chicago to Des Plaines in 1959 where Lorraine gave birth to two more children, Jerry and Kenny. After moving to Des Plaines, the couple joined St. Stephen Parish, where Lorraine was an active member of the Women's Club, a scout leader, and an avid supporter of her children's athletic endeavors. In her later years, family remained the focal point of her life and nothing put a smile on her face like a visit or a call. She loved holding and snuggling all her grandchildren and great grandchildren. The family asks that if you choose to make a memorial contribution, please send it to Catholic Charities, 835 North Rush Street, Chicago, IL 60690.

ZEELAND -- A family in Zeeland has set up a "little free library" of books about racism and race in America as one small way to help those who want to learn more about the experience of black Americans and the history that has led up to the widespread protests after the killing of George Floyd.
   
 Cydney Sheneman started building her personal collection of books about race in America last summer after reading Austin Channing Brown's book, "I'm Still Here: Black Dignity in a World Made for Whiteness."
   
 She described the experience as "tearing off her white privilege blinders" and launched a process of re-educating herself about race. As a teacher, Sheneman said she wanted to make sure she was keyed in to the experiences of her black students.
   
 "And then I realized I had so many books that I was not going to be able to read them all at one time, and I was looking at this pile of books and I was like, well, I'd love to share," Sheneman said. "So that's how (the library) came about."
   
 She set up The Little Anti-Racism Library in front of her house across the street from Hoogland Park in Zeeland on Sunday and posted about it on her Instagram account. Since then, students, family, friends and strangers have checked out books from her library and she's even developed a hold list for the most-requested books. People have also contributed books of their own to her stock.
   
 "There are so many great black authors and people who are doing the research and who are sharing their stories and their information that I want to amplify their voices," Sheneman said. "The information's out there, and I feel like a lot of people are not sure where to start, so it was also maybe the teacher in me that I want to provide resources for people when they want to educate themselves."
   
 Sheneman encourages people to donate to the authors when they check out books from her library in order to support their work.
   
 Books about race and racism are in high demand this week, with bookstores around the country selling out of books on the topic as many Americans look for ways to educate themselves.
   
 On Thursday, Reader's World bookstore in Holland sold out of its books about racism in a single morning after someone made a pay-it-forward donation to cover the cost of the bookstore giving away one free book on the topic per customer.
   
 "Someone approached us on our Instagram wanting to make a donation for people to acquire anti-racism books for free, just to promote people educating themselves on anti-racism," said owner Lisa Hungerink. "Long story short we posted it about 5 p.m. on Wednesday and it just kind of went viral, it exploded, and the funds were gone before noon the next day."
      
 Hungerink said their suppliers, too, are out of popular titles about race such as "White Fragility" by Robin DiAngelo, "How to Be an Antiracist" by Ibram X. Kendi and "The New Jim Crow" by Michelle Alexander.
   
 "They're out of stock everywhere," Hungerink said.
   
 The bookshop is working on restocking, and Hungerink said more people have reached out wanting to pay it forward and contribute, too. She was amazed by the community response and the number of people wanting to read about race and racial injustice.
   
 "The phones were ringing off the hook with people who saw it," Hungerink said. "It gives me goosebumps that people are so motivated to educate themselves on anti-racism."
   
 Sheneman set up an Instagram account for her library where she hopes to facilitate follow-up conversations once people finish reading the books they've checked out from her library.
   
 "I've met a lot of people from our community doing this," Sheneman said. "And I also feel like this work needs to be done in community. So by a lot of people reading the same books, we can be in discussion with each other, hopefully, about what we're learning."

 Protesters close to the White House held banners and signs that read "no peace without justice," "stop racism now" and "I can't breathe" ‚Äî the last words of Floyd who died after a police officer knelt on his neck for close to nine minutes.
 Ahead of the planned demonstration, military vehicles and officers in fatigues closed off much of downtown Washington to traffic. The White House has been fortified with new fencing and extra security precautions.

According to a tweet from the capital's traffic police, there were around 6,000 protesters split between the Lincoln Memorial and in front of the White House, by midday. Officials said they expected crowds of between 100,000 to 200,000, despite soaring temperatures.


  Protesters close to the White House held banners and signs that read "no peace without justice," "stop racism now" and "I can't breathe" ‚Äî the last words of Floyd who died after a police officer knelt on his neck for close to nine minutes.


  Ahead of the planned demonstration, military vehicles and officers in fatigues closed off much of downtown Washington to traffic. The White House has been fortified with new fencing and extra security precautions.


  Hundreds of demonstrators who marched past the George Washington University Hospital chanted "Hands up, Don't shoot!" "We March for hope, not for hate," and "I can't breathe!"

Chinese short video app makers have taken their rivalry overseas, with TikTok facing stiff competition from a newcomer that has surged in popularity abroad -- by paying users to keep scrolling.


  Zynn, a product of China's number-two video app maker Kuaishou, launched in May and became the most popular free app in the US Apple App Store just a month later.


  With Zynn, Kuaishou is trying to dethrone TikTok, the app by its Beijing- based competitor Bytedance that has become a worldwide sensation.


  Zynn's interface is a near-clone of TikTok, allowing users to view a continuous feed of short videos featuring other users dancing or performing stunts to upbeat music.


  But unlike TikTok, Zynn promises more than just entertainment.


  Zynn, which is not available in China, rewards users in the US and Canada with cash when they invite friends to download the app -- up to $20 per invite, depending on how active the friend is on the app.


  Users also earn points for simply watching videos, which can then be converted into cash.


  Zynn's model is familiar to users in China, where startups have thrown millions of yuan in gifts and cash at users in order to grab a larger share of the market than competitors offering nearly identical services.


  Nasdaq-listed news aggregator Qutoutiao was among the first apps to offer users cash rewards in what it calls "loyalty programmes" that "cost- effectively acquire new users".


  "It requires people who are sensitive to small financial incentives of which there are plenty in China's vast inland rural areas," Shanghai-based mobile technology expert Matthew Brennan told AFP.


  Kuaishou is taking a gamble in exporting its model to North America, where few apps have managed to build long-term audiences by paying people to use them.


  Success will depend on whether the main attraction of the app is the money up for grabs, or whether payment is "merely a secondary 'side benefit' to using Zynn", Rui Ma, a tech advisor and host of the Tech Buzz China podcast, told AFP.


  Most online reviews of Zynn are focused on the cash reward system, with reviewers either complaining about being unable to withdraw their winnings or grateful for the amounts they've made off the app.


  \- 'Money-making app' -


  Kuaishou has chosen a "smart" time for Zynn's debut, with many young people stuck at home because of COVID-19, and with the summer holidays approaching, said Man-Chung Cheung, an analyst at Insider Intelligence.


  But in the long run, retaining users will depend on Zynn's "ability to attract top content creators, talent and brands to share videos", Cheung told AFP.


  Kuaishou will also have to contend with rising China-US tensions, which have already put rival TikTok and other Chinese tech companies under increased scrutiny from the US government.


  US officials have warned that TikTok, which has denied any ties with the Chinese government, could become another tool exploited by Chinese intelligence services.


  Zynn has sought to downplay its Chinese origins, with its website offering little information about its background and giving an address in Palo Alto, California.


  Zynn spokesman Rocky Zhang confirmed that Kuaishou is behind the upstart app.


  "Zynn is a product only for the US, and we launched Zynn for the US," he told AFP.


  Zhang said Zynn plans to continue paying users in the long term, but will shift towards rewarding "content creators" in the future, while generating revenue through advertising.


  \- Old rivals -


  A years-long rivalry between massive Chinese tech companies lies behind Kuaishou's new foray across the Pacific and into North America.


  Kuaishou is backed by Tencent, the Chinese tech giant behind payment and social media app WeChat, which has long sought to expand its share of the short-video market.


  The Chinese short-video industry is expected to generate nearly 100 billion yuan ($14 billion) in advertising revenue by 2021, according to Daxue Consulting.


  Tencent has launched a number of short-video apps of its own, but none have reached the level of popularity enjoyed by Kuaishou and TikTok's Chinese version, Douyin.


  Kuaishou in February said it had reached 300 million daily active users, just behind Douyin, which said it hit 400 million users in January.


  In May, Kuaishou sued Douyin for redirecting searches for "Kuaishou" on a third-party Chinese app store to adds for the Bytedance app, a court in Beijing said.


  When asked about the similarity between TikTok and Zynn, Zhang said the app was not "targeting any brands existing on the market".

There is a growing population waking up to the horror show that constitutes these technocratic shit bags. Pedophelia, human trafficking, torture, mass killings, purposeful toxication of our food supply, GMO's, chemtrails, war profiteering, genocide, financial enslavement, militarization of civilian police, 5G, vaccinations, mass ID programs‚Ä¶the list is unbelievable and can no longer be so easily hidden. These aren't conspiracy theories. They are easily proven facts to anyone who scratches a bit, like taking the silver sheen off a lottery ticket number. A little effort and you see that it is a losing ticket. There is a part of me that thinks they have played their hand too early for some reason. Presently, it seems as if they are going for all of the marbles. I've had some discussions with educated friends and they agree if this would have waited ten years, then we would have had no chance. All speculation. Right now many are struggling to get back into their cocoons, their safe little technological nest surrounded by TV and the internet. I hate to use the Matrix as a parallel but it is just so damn perfect. Do what we say and you can go back to sleep - see how bad we can make it. People are waking up, though, and will never go back to sleep. If enough of the masses realize that there is no going back, that this is a struggle to the death, then all bets are off. This is the technocrats greatest fear. I will say that there is something inhuman about the path we are headed down. I've gone back and forth on this for three decades - no longer‚Ä¶done enough research to trust my heart. Human psychopathy is simply not consistent enough from decade to decade - century to century - to explain the path we are traveling on.

Asked if it had boarded up any of its locations, the company declined to comment beyond its statement. No money was stolen from the damaged locations, it said.


  In New York City's Herald Square shopping mecca, almost all stores are boarded up and several shops, including Sephora, carry signs saying, "Store Closed, No Inventory, No Cash." One closed CVS Pharmacy store is only partially boarded up, leaving the other side clear.


  For businesses, the decision to board up must be made on the fly as events evolve. CVS, which has boarded up some of its nearly 10,000 locations around the country, estimated that about 400 of its stores across 25 states have "experienced varying levels of damage" in recent days.


  "Most of these stores have since reopened, but the number of store closures is fluid," said Mike DeAngelis, senior director of corporate communications at CVS. "We're continually monitoring the situation and will close stores, if needed, to ensure the safety of employees and customers."


  While some restaurants have boarded up during this time, Fresh & Co. has chosen not to, with one exception. The family-owned restaurant group, which sells healthy food and has 19 locations, all in New York, told CNN Business that it put up plywood over the windows of a single location that was vandalized last week, the CEO said.


  "We are not concerned for broken storefronts, as we are not a desirable target for looting and rioters," said George Tenedios, Fresh & Co.'s CEO and co-founder. "Our decision to not board up all our locations was due to the lack of resources, as we are still on stay-at-home orders, and the assumption that the looters and rioters are targeting larger companies, clothing, jewelry, liquor, etc."


  Tenedios also pointed out that many Fresh & Co. restaurants have no inventory as they've been closed for almost three months due to the pandemic. "We are hopeful that the riots and looting will end sooner than later, and we pray we can all safely get back to work and rebuild our business," he said.

HAMPTON, Ga. -- A.J. Allmendinger won a NASCAR oval race for the first time in his long career.
   
 Taking advantage of mistakes by the three leaders, the 38-year-old Californian cruised to victory by nearly 2 seconds over pole-sitter Noah Gragson in the Xfinity Series race at Atlanta Motor Speedway on Saturday.
   
 "Oh my god," Allmendinger said as he climbed from his No. 16 Chevrolet. "I won on an oval."
   
 Indeed, he did.
   
 Allmendinger, who first came to prominence in open-wheel racing, claimed a single victory during more than a decade in the top-level Cup series, and he had three previous Xfinity wins -- all on road courses.
   
 Now, he filled in a big hole on his resume.
   
 "All I ever wanted to do was win on an oval," said Allmendinger, who has only a part-time ride in the Xfinity Series after losing his Cup ride after the 2018 season. "I have a lot of success in so many forms of racing."
   
 Allmendinger started 30th but quickly showed the strength of his car, spending much of the day running in the top 10.
   
 Then, after the final caution of the day, the top three cars -- Chase Briscoe, Austin Cindric and Justin Allgaier -- were all caught speeding on pit road.
   
 That pushed Allmendinger into the top spot on the restart with 34 laps to go.
   
 He held on the rest of the way.
   
 Cindric had the strongest car early on, winning the first two stages. But his mistake heading into the pits knocked him back to a 16th-place finish.
   
 Allgaier savaged a sixth-place showing, while Briscoe settled for ninth.
   
 Gragson crossed the line second but picked up a $100,000 bonus from the title sponsor.
   
 He was closing the gap on Allmendinger in the closing laps, but got hoodwinked by the more experienced driver.
   
 Allmendinger gave the impression that his tires were fading, duping Gragson into making a furious run for the front.
   
 Turns out, Allmendinger's tires had more grip than he was letting on. Gragson didn't have anything left at the end.
   
 "I got beat by his experience," the 21-year-old Gragson conceded. "He had the bait waiting there. I took it, and he reeled me in."

In 1972, a Stanford University psychologist conducted a study in which young children, individually, were offered either a small but immediate reward (a marshmallow or a pretzel) or a doubled reward if they were able to wait for 15 minutes. In follow-up studies, researchers found that children who were able to postpone gratification experienced better life outcomes as measured by such things as SAT scores, academic achievement and body mass index.
 I have long maintained that well-done research in the so-called social sciences does nothing but confirm common sense, and it certainly seems commonsensical that impulsivity and difficulty delaying gratification have a negative impact on life outcomes.
 The Stanford Marshmallow Experiment, as it is known, bears significantly on child-rearing attitudes and approaches. Simply, teaching a naturally impulse- driven child to exercise restraint greatly increases the child‚Äôs chances of success.
 In previous columns I have extolled the parenting virtues of ‚ÄúVitamin N,‚Äù referring to the two-letter word that the mental health community began demonizing in the late 1960s, claiming it induced all manner of psychological problems.
 Supposedly, said vitamin was part and parcel of ‚Äúshame-based‚Äù parenting (which refers to child-rearing that activates a child‚Äôs conscience). Even today, despite common sense and a body of research akin to the Stanford study, I continue to hear of parents and preschools that adhere to a ‚Äúno no‚Äù policy.
 I have been so bold and psychologically incorrect to say that children should hear ‚Äúno‚Äù at least five times more than they hear ‚Äúyes.‚Äù
 That proportion approximates what they are going to experience post- emancipation as they learn to navigate real world contingencies. The earlier in life a person adjusts his expectations to reality, the better.
 Because children are impulsive and instant gratification oriented by nature (as opposed to those traits being the result of chemical imbalances and other pseudo-scientific fictions), learning restraint involves psychic pain, which children express in tantrums and various forms of petulance. Teaching restraint, therefore, requires that parents also be able to tolerate pain. Having raised two children and assisted in the raising of seven grands, I can attest that there are few things more painful to endure than the prolonged shrieking of a young child.
 And so, it is ironic to note that those parents who are better able to restrain the impulse to end said shrieking by giving in are more likely to raise children who can tolerate delay of gratification and achieve life success. Endowing restraint requires restraint. Teaching endurance requires endurance.
 Take it from an expert on the subject, when all is said and done, life success is not a matter of money, prestige, honors and the like. It is a matter of personal contentment, a sense of serenity that no outside influence can disturb.
 Contentment is life‚Äôs brass ring. Enabling a child to eventually, much later in life, grasp it requires daily doses of Vitamin N, the greatest and most painful of gifts.

After the state of emergency was declared in early April, NTT Data employees were asked to stay home, in principle. From June, the firm's policy is to have 50 percent of employees or more work from home and for those who do come to the office to stagger their hours.


  Yuji Nomura, 39, who is involved in the development of artificial intelligence at the company, started coming to work 30 minutes later than usual in March.


  He says the later start has "relieved stress" since he can avoid crowds on public transportation. He is thinking of working from home two or three times a week and working staggered hours in the office in the future.


  On May 14, the day when the emergency declaration was lifted for most of Japan, the Japan Business Federation, or Keidanren, called on member companies to consider introducing "various working styles" including teleworking, a four-day workweek and staggered hours to reduce the spread of COVID-19.


  Essentially, the country's largest business lobby was advising companies that had introduced such measures as emergency steps to make them permanent.


  Toshiba Corp. has begun to consider introducing a four-day workweek for office work and factories. Other major companies, such as Hitachi Ltd. and Mitsubishi Electric Corp., have said they will continue with work from home for around 50 percent of their employees for the time being.


  Tokyo-based Bellface Inc., which provides an online business conference system connecting users via smartphone or landline, has seen a rapid increase in inquiries.


  In the four and a half years since it was founded, the number of companies using the system has risen from 1,300 to over 10,000 in March and April, when a free version was launched to help companies combat the coronavirus crisis.


  While its customers are still mainly in the Tokyo metropolitan area, take-up has increased especially in areas hard-hit by the outbreak such as Hokkaido, Osaka and Hyogo prefectures.


  Business materials and business cards can be provided to customers online. The mouse's cursor can be moved by other parties during a business call, making it easy to explain the shared materials. Anyone can readily use the system since no preparation, such as sharing URLs, is required, the company said.


  "Time and place restrictions are eliminated," said a company official, calling it an "opportunity" for local companies.


  One big obstacle for introducing such remote work reforms, some say, is productivity ‚Äî which may fall when people are away from their office.


  According to a survey by the Japan Productivity Center, although more than 60 percent of people wish to continue working from home after the pandemic has eased, nearly the same percentage admit to seeing "a drop in work efficiency."


  Many voice concerns about barriers such as the sharing of data that cannot be viewed outside the workplace and problems with communication, likely forcing companies to decide whether to invest in equipment upgrades.

Amid the strife, Abe has spoken obliquely of a larger global role for Japan and building a new international order while signaling that the country will cooperate with other nations that share the ‚Äúuniversal values of freedom, democracy, basic human rights, and the rule of law.‚Äù


  While some experts have said these kinds of remarks are undoubtedly aimed at Beijing, they have also warned that they could come back to haunt Abe.


  There‚Äôs ‚Äúno doubt these comments are targeted at China,‚Äù said Yuki Tatsumi, co-director of the East Asia Program at the Stimson Center think tank in Washington. ‚ÄúBut I would say when it comes to China, I think Japan is in the middle of a ‚Äòbe careful what you wish for‚Äô moment.‚Äù


  Tatsumi said that Japan has long been frustrated with the lack of urgency in Washington toward Chinese assertiveness, and had long hoped it would come out as ‚Äúmore explicitly critical of some of China's problematic behavior.‚Äù


  ‚ÄúBut now that the Trump administration has been demonstrating in no uncertain terms its hard-line stance toward China, Japan is feeling anxious whether it can align itself with Washington all the way,‚Äù she said, adding that this dilemma was likely only to grow as the talk of "decoupling" with Chinese supply chains continues and the U.S. weighs on allies like Tokyo.
