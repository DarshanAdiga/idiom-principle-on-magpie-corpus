It looks like the Town of Clifton has a general plan.
 According to early voting results, 76 percent of Clifton's early voters approved the plan that the town devised to help guide council members as they make crucial decisions on such things as land use, transportation and economic development.
 For the past two years, council members have been working on a General Plan with town residents, said Mayor Luis Montoya. After several public meetings, the plan was adopted in April.
 The only thing left for voters to do was to ratify it Nov. 3. It was listed as Proposition 400 on the ballot.
 In addition to land use, economic development and transportation, the 112-page General Plan delves into growth areas, housing and beautification, recreation, making a healthy community, public facilities, water resources and environmental planning.
 During the process, Montoya said the town spent a lot of time analyzing what the community has and needs.
 At the end, Montoya said they came to realize that when it comes to land, they need to focus on filling in sections within the town limits since the town is “landlocked.”
 “There are very few areas where we can have expansion of any kind because it’s either owned by the state or the company (Freeport-McMoRan),” Montoya said.
 It was determined other areas were too cost prohibitive to pursue; there are no water or sewage systems, he said.
 Council members and residents also agreed the town needs to explore the possibility of creating more recreation possibilities along the San Francisco River, Montoya said.
 The general plan had been posted on the town’s website for at least six months and no one had spoken ill of it, Montoya said.

Those who supported the referendum said that a basic standard should be required since all students could benefit from sexual health information. Young children would learn social emotional skills, including how to make friends; older students would learn about navigating relationships, recognizing sexual violence and what to do if it happens and how sexually transmitted infections are spread and prevented.
 The group supporting the law, including several prominent labor unions, civil rights groups and Democratic state officials, had raised more than $1.69 million as of Tuesday.
 Opponents led a historic signature-gathering campaign in the spring, braving drive- and walk-thru signing booths to get the referendum on the ballot. They’ve argued that mandating such lessons strips power from local school boards. Some are also strongly opposed to certain sexual health education topics. Opponents, which include the state’s Republican Party and several anti-abortion organizations, had raised about $461,000 by Tuesday.

A five-day workshop to create a name  
 and two brand identities.  
   
 Our challenge was to create the name of the commercial offer, in a participative way, in one day. We gathered about ten participants around a large table, equipped with pencils and exercise books specially made by us. The methodology was intended to be simple, fun and demanding. We had one morning to collectively establish the brand platform, and the rest of the day to come up with name leads.     
 The aim was to move from an abstract idea to a concrete definition of the brand. It was also an opportunity to create a common language and unite the teams around the new project.     
 This is where collective intelligence takes on its full meaning. Around the table, all the employees of Croix-Rouge insertion took up the game. Each with their own words, images and ideas. At the end of the day, we got a list of 10 realistic names. "Vif!" got the majority of the votes.      Vif! can be translated as "lively".  
 Vif! as in "Valorisation-Insertion-Formation" (Valorization-Integration- Training).
   
 At this point, we had 4 days left to create two visual identities!

Fischbach carried 50.97% of the vote compared to Peterson’s 40.48% with 588 of 1,329 precincts reporting around 10:10 p.m. Tuesday. Results, which may not contain all results returned by mail, continued to stream in slowly Tuesday evening.
 Legal Marijuana Now candidate Slater Johnson and Grassroots-Legalize Cannabis candidate Rae Hart Anderson split the remaining 7% of the vote in the vast district that spans nearly the entire western edge of the state.
 The race was one of the most hotly contested in the nation heading into Election Day. The 7th District gave President Donald Trump the largest margin of victory over Hillary Clinton of any represented by a Democratic member of Congress. And with a GOP candidate who has better name recognition and stronger financial backing than any who've challenged Peterson in recent years, Republicans have said they're confident they can unseat Peterson.
 Peterson launched his bid for reelection and a 16th term in office with the strong backing of state and national farming groups. Fischbach, meanwhile, immediately flipped the contest to a toss-up status last year when she announced she would aim to break a nearly 30-year Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party hold on the seat.

Madrid, Nov 3 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 4th Nov, 2020 ) :Real Madrid thwarted a second half comeback from Inter Milan to win 3-2 on Tuesday and give their Champions League bid lift-off in Group B.
 Madrid's 19-year-old Brazilian Rodrygo came off the bench to score the winner at the empty Alfredo di Stefano stadium, where Inter threatened a remarkable turnaround after drawing level from two goals down.
 Lautaro Martinez and Ivan Perisic gave Inter hope of victory after Karim Benzema and Sergio Ramos had put Madrid in command, Ramos heading in a second after half an hour for his 100th Real Madrid goal.
 But Rodrygo had the last word, his cool finish in the 80th minute earning Zinedine Zidane's side their first win to leave Inter with a mountain to climb if they are to make the last 16.
 These teams were expected to fight for the top two spots in the group but both came into this game on the back of stumbling starts, Inter taking two points and Madrid just one from opening games against Borussia Moenchengladbach and Shakhtar Donetsk.
 Neither coach could afford another slip-up either after a bumpy few weeks. Antonio Conte's Inter have now won only one of their last seven games while Madrid appear to have turned a corner following consecutive losses last month.
 The lively Perisic replaced the injured Romelu Lukaku up front for Inter and Eden Hazard started for the second time this season for Madrid. The Belgian delivered only in glimpses before being taken off shortly after the hour.

The state Democratic Party was better organized this election than in 2016, and the former vice president visited Selma before the coronavirus pandemic shut down much of his campaign for months, but Biden couldn't close a gap that has taken on historical proportions in Alabama.
 U.S. SENATE
 Republicans trying to maintain control of the U.S. Senate are staking their hopes on former college football coach Tommy Tuberville defeating first-term Democratic Sen. Doug Jones, who won the seat in a special election in 2017.
 Tuberville, who has never held public office and last coached four years ago, is among the candidates who've aligned themselves mostly closely with Trump, even declaring in the primary campaign: "God sent us Donald Trump."
 Viewed as an underdog in a Republican-controlled state, Jones mocked Tuberville as "Coach Clueless" and chided him for his refusal to debate.
 Jones won the seat previously held by Trump's first attorney general, Jeff Sessions, after GOP Senate candidate Roy Moore was publicly accused of sexual misconduct involving young women decades ago. With GOP incumbents in danger elsewhere, Republicans hope Tuberville can knock off Jones.
 U.S. HOUSE
 The state will have at least two new members of Congress after voters pick winners in races for two open U.S. House seats in south Alabama.
 The Republican chairman of the Mobile County Commission, Jerry Carl, is trying to keep GOP control in the southwest Alabama seat now held by Rep. Bradley Byrne. Carl is facing Democrat James Averhart, a retired Marine who runs a nonprofit group and directs the Mobile-area office of the NAACP.
 In southeast Alabama's 2nd District, Republican Barry Moore of Enterprise and Democrat Phyllis Harvey-Hall are vying for the job of GOP Rep. Martha Roby, who didn't seek reelection. Moore is a former state representative and business owner, while Harvey-Hall is an educator from Montgomery.
 Two Republican House members are also hoping to win reelection. Rep. Mike Rogers of Saks is seeking a 10th term in east Alabama's 3rd District against Democrat Adia Winfrey, while Rep. Robert Aderholt of Haleyville is seeking a 13th term in office against Democrat Rick Neighbors in the 4th District, which includes much of north Alabama.
 Reps. Mo Brooks of Huntsville; Gary Palmer of Hoover; and Terri Sewell of Selma were unopposed in the general election.
 CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS
 Six statewide constitutional amendments are on the ballot, including one that would remove racist language from the state's 1901 constitution, which was passed to ensure white supremacy in Alabama.
 Sponsored by Rep. Merika Coleman of Birmingham, Amendment 4 would allow a recompilation of the state constitution to remove wording that prohibited mixed-race marriage and mandated racially segregated schools. While the prohibitions are no longer in effect, supporters of the amendment say they are an embarrassment and should be removed.
 Recommended changes to the constitution would be submitted to lawmakers in 2022 for approval, and voters would again be asked to approve the stripped- down document. Voters defeated similar measures twice before, most recently in 2012.
 Amendment 1 is a mostly symbolic measure pushed by Republicans that says only U.S. citizens have the right to vote, which already is the law nationally.
 Amendment 2 would allow the full Alabama Supreme Court to appoint the director of the state's court system, a task now performed solely by the chief justice, and make other changes to the judicial system. Amendment 3 would extend the amount of time that appointed district and circuit judges can serve.
 Amendments 5 and 6 would protect anyone who kills someone in self-defense in a church in Franklin and Lauderdale counties. Alabama's "stand your ground" law already applies inside churches, the attorney general's office has said, but backers support more specific provisions.
 PSC PRESIDENT
 Republican Twinkle Andress Cavanaugh is seeking reelection as president of the utility-regulating Alabama Public Service Commission against Democrat Laura Casey.
 Cavanaugh, seeking her third term, was the first woman to serve as chair of the Alabama Republican Party and has closely aligned herself with President Trump while espousing conservative orthodoxy. She says keeping power rates low helps families and business development.
 Casey contends the three-member, all-Republican PSC is more interested in protecting the state's largest electrical utility, Alabama Power Co., than consumers. She recently lost an appeal to the Alabama Supreme Court, which rejected her right to videotape a hearing held before the PSC about solar energy fees.
 STATE SCHOOL BOARD
 The ballot on Tuesday includes three contested seats on the Alabama State Board of Education.
 In the District 1 race in southwest Alabama, Republican board vice president Jackie Zeigler, a retired principal, is opposed by Democratic nominee Tom Holmes, a retired state employee who also led a disabilities advocacy program.
 Republican Stephanie Bell is touting her experience supporting educational programs, including the Alabama Reading Initiative, as she seeks an eighth term representing the 3rd District of central Alabama. She is opposed by Jarralynne Agee, provost and vice president of academic affairs at Miles College in Birmingham.
 In the 5th District, which includes much of Alabama's Black Belt region, Democrat Tonya Smith Chestnut and Republican Lesa Keith are vying for the position now held by appointee Tommie Stewart. Chestnut is a retired educator while Keith serves on the Montgomery school board and works as a real estate broker.

NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian said on Wednesday the border between her state and Victoria would come down this month.She made the much anticipated announcement as Victoria notched a fifth straight “donut day” — zero new cases or deaths from COVID-19 – and NSW recorded three new locally acquired cases, all in isolation, and six in hotel quarantine.Queensland recorded two new cases, both in hotel quarantine. Queensland opened its borders to millions of NSW residents on Tuesday morning, but the more than 5 million residents in Sydney’s 32 local government areas remain locked out, as do Victorians. Ms Palaszczuk told reporters on Wednesday she would make a decision on whether Sydney and Victorian residents can travel to Queensland for Christmas by the end of the month. “I’ve said all along we review those decisions at the end of the month, when the chief health officer will provide us her latest advice, which we will take,” Ms Palaszczuk said. “What is encouraging from Victoria is their really low case numbers … but they are coming out of lockdown, so we’ll be looking carefully at them over November. “Our number one goal is to keep Queenslanders safe.”Decisions on easing the state’s border restrictions are made based on community transmission and testing rates, and Ms Palaszczuk said she wanted to make sure Victoria continued to see “the flattening of the curve”. While many hospitality and tourism heavyweights are calling for borders to open up faster, it seems interstate travellers are taking advantage of Queensland’s mostly-opened borders.Destination Gold Coast chairman Paul Donovan said there had been an upswing in bookings since the last border decision was made, and that it was good to see customer numbers “finally increasing”.

 "We should be entitled to know who won on November 3," he said.

 "I think we're going to have a great night but it's politics and it's elections and you never know," he said.
 In an interview with "Fox and Friends," Trump dismissed reports he may declare victory prematurely. "Only when there is victory," he said. "There is no reason to play games." Biden, who is making his third bid for the presidency, began Election Day with a visit to the church where his son, Beau Biden, and first wife and daughter are buried, and to his childhood home in Scranton, Pennsylvania.

Jonathan Justin Shorley, 41, boarded the train at Dimboola, Victoria, and was arrested by police on its arrival in Adelaide on October 21. Shorley, of Horsham in regional Victoria, spent the following two weeks behind bars and pleaded guilty to failing to comply with a direction during a hearing in the Adelaide Magistrates Court on Wednesday. The court heard he had applied for essential traveller status under South Australia’s COVID directions, but he had not been approved by the time he crossed the border. At the time of Shorley’s arrival, Victorians were not allowed to enter South Australia unless they had been granted an exemption. Defence counsel Patrick Deegan said his client was currently a train driver’s assistant but is training to be a driver and the purpose of his trip was to visit the South Australian depot. “It means that he would be somewhat more employable and further his career,” he said. A letter handed to the court from Shorley’s employer, Pacific National, said he was required to travel throughout Victoria and occasionally interstate for work. Mr Deegan asked Magistrate Jayne Basheer not to record a conviction for reasons including potential impacts on his client’s future career. He said Shorley’s phone had been taken from him when he was arrested, and for a period his family was not aware of his whereabouts. Ms Basheer released Shorley without further penalty, given the time he had already served in custody, but recorded a conviction. “It’s imperative in the COVID pandemic that the community is protected, and I think to decline to record a conviction sends the wrong message,” she said.

Hong Kong, Nov 4 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 4th Nov, 2020 ) :Asian markets were mixed Wednesday as traders tracked results of the US presidential election, with an early rally pared by worries that the outcome might not be as clear-cut as hoped.
 Shares have rallied this week as traders piled bets on Joe Biden winning the White House, with opinion polls showing him with a big national lead though with slim advantages in battleground states.
 While the former vice president was still favourite, trading floors grew nervous after it appeared Donald Trump was on course to win Florida, which would be crucial to his success.
 A better-than-forecast performance by the president could mean the final outcome might not be known until later this week, while it also throws up the chances of a challenge to the result, which could spell fresh market turmoil and legal chaos.
 Investors had been increasingly betting on a Democratic sweep of Congress and the White House, which would pave the way for a massive stimulus package for the stuttering economy but early figures suggest that might not happen.
 While Tuesday is formally Election Day, in reality, Americans have been voting for weeks. The Covid-19 pandemic caused a huge expansion in mail-in and early voting, and nearly 100 million people had already cast their ballots, though many of those will not be counted until polls close.
 "Markets have taken a step back from the Democratic sweep scenario -- though are not yet giving up on it," said Axi strategist Stephen Innes.
 "Biden is still favoured to win the presidency, but we now could be heading towards a delayed confirmation of the winner of the election, which is probably the worst-case scenario for risk." Tokyo rose 1.4 percent by the break, while Seoul, Wellington, Taipei and Jakarta were all up around 0.2 percent up. Manila jumped more than one percent.
 However, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Singapore and Sydney were all in the red.

The perpetually unruffled Republican lawmaker has served in the Senate since 1985 and as the majority leader since 2007, a record tenure for the position.

Part of California's success, Weinberg says, is due to its hands-on approach in deciding which insurers may join the market. And it got involved in negotiating the price of plans, which helped keep a lid on premiums compared with other states.
