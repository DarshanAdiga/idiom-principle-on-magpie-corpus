CIMA must have known that he would need to take risks if he was to gain the advantage on the champ but the end of the match came when he missed a top rope move and Fatu countered into a pop-up Samoan drop. The champion then went to the top and delivered a devastating moonsault but was then instructed by Josef Samael on the outside to deliver one more for good measure before pinning his challenger and retaining his title.

It was the in-form Chelsea forward England who thought she had broken the deadlock on 32 minutes when Nobbs slipped her in but her powerful effort was well kept out by the feet of Ikeda who raced off her line quickly.
 It was Japan who started the second half the better as Sugita fired a powerful drive in but England was there to make the block before the ball fell to Yuka Momiki who planted her effort over the crossbar.
 However, England found herself with another good opportunity on 57 minutes when she was played in but miscontrolled the ball and Ikeda was on her toes to come out and collect the loose ball.
 On 61 minutes Arsenal's Leah Williamson was introduced alongside Duggan and Nikita Parris as England were trying to up their intensity.
 Duggan made an instant impact when she clipped a free-kick into the box for Steph Houghton to volley at goal but she fired her effort over the top when well placed to score.
 Nobbs then tried her luck from range on 75 minutes as Lucy Staniforth's free- kick found her but her effort was always rising and sailed over the crossbar from 25 yards.
 England's goal did arrive, though, with seven minutes to go as Japan lost the ball playing out from the back, before Duggan picked it up and found White who slotted into the corner of the net past the despairing dive of the keeper to seal the victory.
 England: Roebuck, Stokes, Bright, Houghton, Daly, Walsh, Nobbs, Hemp, Stanway, Kelly, England.

Ball and Enjeti are two of today’s most insightful voices—on the left and right, respectively—in American political media, and they are proudly out of step with the CNNs and _Washington Post_ s of the world. When the corporate media giants fail to inform and the corporate political parties start to shake, it requires brave truth tellers to represent the actual sentiments of the American people, and both attempt to do just that in a new book titled _The Populist’s Guide to 2020_ , available now via Strong Arm Press.
