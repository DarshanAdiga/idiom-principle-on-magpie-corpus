As such, Buddhism helps safeguard us not only from neurosis caused by our being overconcerned with losing all our lifetime hard-earned wealth, but also from committing suicide after, unfortunately, losing it along with our associated high self-esteem thereby leading to a total loss of face with zero meaning to live.

In addition, Dr. Fromm very much agrees with Zen’s emphasis that the goal of life is “to be,” viz., to be spontaneous and productive to self and others, rather than “to have,” viz., to have a livelihood devoted to the blind and relentless pursuit of insatiable wealth and materials in a “dog eat dog” world, while suffering, as a result, a host of the anguishes, including a breakdown with neurosis, which represents a common mental illness afflicting those who would think of nothing except variable ways of acquiring the never- sufficed sum of money on a 24X7x365 schedule.

In addition, based on his over five-decade long of professional practices, Dr. Fromm made a significant contribution to psychoanalysis by distinctively recommending in one of his well-read books, The Sane Society, that, after diagnosis, it would be in the best interest of the patient for a mental health care provider to prescribe her/him additional remedy directions with a view to enhancing recovery. Interestingly, his recommendation parallels the approach by the Buddha in his rendering of spiritual healing for humankind.

Luke Shaw gave a damning assessment of Manchester United as the defender admitted his side "gave up" in their "embarrassing" 6-1 defeat against Tottenham on Sunday. United suffered their heaviest defeat at Old Trafford since 2011 and Shaw had no qualms about accepting blame for the shambolic display. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's men took the lead through Bruno Fernandes' second minute penalty, but still crumbled to one of the most humiliating results in the club's history.

"In light of the hearing, the FCA will review the final declarations and decide on its next steps," the City regulator said on Friday. "These will include pressing on with the application to appeal to the Supreme Court while continuing discussions with insurers and action groups to find a solution that avoids the need for appeal and enables pay-outs on eligible claims as quickly as possible."

Let's make some wobbly assumptions and look to the future. Suppose the country survives the onslaught of lies -- or "alternative facts," as Kellyanne Conway (remember her?) used to call the stream-of-conscious gibberish Donald Trump tweets and screams at rallies -- and Joe Biden wins the election. Then we get past all of Trump's post-election chicanery or something even more serious and Biden is declared the winner.
 At the time of the election, the Trump presidency would have more than two months to go. That is plenty of time for Trump to do a huge amount of damage while still in office. He could approve any number of malicious policies and corrupt giveaways. He could pardon all of his buddies. There are wars he could start, and there is little that Biden could do about it until he is inaugurated.
 Until noon, Jan. 21, 2021, Trump remains POTUS, with enormous power to act against his political enemies or give further leeway to certain special interests -- especially his own special interest. Sometime in the afternoon on that Wednesday, new President Biden would have to undo all that outgoing President Trump has done, particularly during the transition period.
 But what about the pardons? There is not much Biden can do. You can't unpardon someone. But what about pardoning Donald Trump? Biden will have to decide whether to allow federal criminal prosecution to proceed investigating all the crimes that Trump has allegedly perpetrated while in office -- or before, when it comes to charges of obstruction, extortion and the tax problems that The New York Times has just alleged, the ones Trump says are "fake news." By now we have learned that what he calls fake news is actually true.
 "Absolutely!" you shout. But do we want to go down the road to a Banana Republic? Is the United States of America going to take that authoritarian step? We already stand accused of criminalizing politics, where independent counsels pop up like whack-a-moles and those on the periphery of any presidency get in legal trouble, even sent to jail, or are bankrupted by attorney fees. Do we want to make the spectacle of a trial and maybe conviction the price you can expect to pay for leadership?
 We need to tread that path very carefully.
 Can a president, before he leaves office, pardon himself for any crimes or future accusations of federal law violations? In the Nixon years, a Justice Department memorandum said no because of "the fundamental rule that no one may be a judge in his own case." But the Constitution contains no such limitation, except in cases of impeachment. But American tradition is that "no man is above the law." The conflict is not resolved.
 Note that the pardon or commutation power does not cover state or local violations, only "offenses against the United States." Nor does it involve civil law or, as we are reminded by The Times' reporting on his tax accounting, being audited. Donald Trump has long experience being sued and audited.
 Trump will "not go gentle into that good night." He attracts the spotlight too much. Of course, as I mentioned, he must lose the election in November, which is a dicey proposition, since Trump knows that when he leaves the White House he steps into legal jeopardy.

"Rather than agreeing to abide by the court's judgment and now pay claims, it is disgraceful that insurers continue to drag their feet and watch more and more of their own policyholders go to the wall," Sonia Campbell, the Mishcon de Reya LLP partner representing HIGA, said. "The fact they have decided to seek permission to appeal shows they are determined to drag this out to the bitter end."

Generally, instead of satisfaction, we are inclined to seek “happiness,” a misnomer in popular self-help literature, with a view to defeating our own pervasive suffering but to no avail. Semantically, we misconstrue happiness as a shallow and short-lived sensation like amusement, cheerfulness, enjoyment, fun, gaiety, glee, gratification, joyfulness, jubilation, laughters, merriment, or pleasure.

On the other hand, for the Buddha to regress to the Evil Mind, we would have to be in a vulnerable position succumbing to outer influences or powers imbued with greed, hatred, and delusion, as well as poisonous cultural dictates. These evil outer forces would then drive us into a relentless pursuit for insatiable wealth and material acquisitions in a “dog eat dog” world.
