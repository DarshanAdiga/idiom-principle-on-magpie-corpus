Avendo vissuto a Trento nel convento dei Cappuccini dal 1942 al 1946 come studente di teologia e giovane padre, è stato, come amava dire, “testimone oculare, però a distanza”, degli inizi del Movimento dei Focolari. A distanza perché in quegli anni non erano consentiti grandi contatti. Eppure testimone oculare perché vedeva come vivevano quelle straordinarie “terziarie francescane”.

"I have found, especially in small races, that many people will vote for you just because of what I like to call, past pleasantries," Mason said. "'We were in third grade together, and you let me use your black crayon and so, hey. I'm voting for you. Now, I don't know your political views, but I'm remembering what happened in the past.'"
 Questions provided range in topic, Mason said.
 "We have about 11 questions that we want to ask that deal with not just black lives matter, but deal with a plethora of questions," he said. "So, we want people to be able to watch it and then be able to say, 'ok, yeah. You let me borrow your crayon in third grade but man, you seem like you've changed over this period of time.'
 "That's what we're really trying to do is, I want people to have an educated voice when they vote."
 Fifteen candidates are running for eight positions in the community and eight have responded to be a part of the forum, Mason said.
 Mason was heartbroken by the small response from candidates, he said.
 "I say to that, your silence is an answer," he said after having mailed out letters a month and a half ago and only having eight respond of the 15 candidates.
 Candidate forums are important to share information on who the community has a chance to vote for, because most voters may not go gather data on candidates on their own, Mason said.
 "I think this knowledge is important now because what Georgetown looks like 10 years down the road is determined by right now," He said.

Biden’s announcement capped a months-long search for a Democratic partner to challenge President Donald Trump in November. Harris, who would become America’s first female and first black vice president if elected, is a “fearless fighter for the little guy, and one of the country’s finest public servants,” Biden, 77, said in revealing his running mate.
 “I’m proud now to have her as my partner in this campaign.” The decision, announced in typical 2020 style on social media, was a crucial moment for Biden as he aims to build a broad coalition of voters to oust Trump from the White House.
 Harris, who at 55 is two decades Biden’s junior, could appeal to younger voters and women, particularly those in the suburbs who have been fleeing Trump. The former California attorney general is the first person of Indian descent in the running mate role, and personifies the diversity seen as key to building enthusiasm for the Democratic ticket, particularly in a year marked by a historic reckoning on race. She is the third female vice presidential nominee for a major party, after the groundbreaking but unsuccessful runs of Democrat Geraldine Ferraro in 1984 and Republican Sarah Palin in 2008.
 Hillary Clinton was the first female presidential nominee, losing to Trump in 2016. Harris, who ran for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination against Biden, said she was “honored” to join the ticket and would “do what it takes” to help him win.
 “@JoeBiden can unify the American people because he’s spent his life fighting for us. And as president, he’ll build an America that lives up to our ideals,” she tweeted.

The army said the strikes were “retaliation” for the launching of multiple balloons from the Hamas-run enclave in recent days. Jets, attack helicopters and tanks struck a number of Hamas targets including “underground infrastructure and observation posts,” a statement said.
 Fire services in southern Israel said the balloons caused 60 fires on Tuesday alone but reported no casualties. Explosives tied to balloons and kites first emerged as a weapon in Gaza during intense protests in 2018, when the makeshift devices drifted across the border daily, causing thousands of fires in Israeli farms and communities.
 Israel has closed its Kerem Shalom goods crossing with the Gaza Strip in response to the recent balloon launches. Hamas denounced the closure as an “aggressive” move that showed Israel’s “insistence on laying siege” to Gaza, and warned it could cause further worsening of the humanitarian situation in the territory.
 As the Kerem Shalom crossing closed, the Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt opened on Tuesday for the first time since April. Traffic in both directions was to be permitted for three days, allowing Gazans to leave the enclave for the first time since the start of the pandemic.
 The Rafah crossing provides Gaza’s sole access to the outside world not controlled by Israel. The Palestinian territory has been under an Israeli blockade since 2007. Hamas and Israel have fought three wars since 2008.
 Despite a truce last year, backed by the UN, Egypt and Qatar, the two sides clash sporadically with rockets, mortar fire or incendiary balloons. Palestinian analysts say cross-border fire from Gaza is often used as a bargaining tool to secure Israel’s green light for the entry of Qatari financial aid into the territory.

Inland Revenue Member Operations Ashfaq Ahmad said establishment of a single tax authority is still part of reform agenda and authorities are engaged to evolve political consensus on the issue.
 “National tax authority is part of tax reform but it needs political consensus,” said Ahmed.
 While talking to media during his visit to Large Taxpayers Unit Karachi, he said major reforms have been initiated in the taxation system. “However, structural issues are at the backend for the time being,” he added.
 The establishment of single tax authority is part of tax reforms program funded by the World Bank. Under the program the single tax authority would be empowered to collect all taxes including sales tax on services and disburse provinces. Besides, the taxpayers must be facilitated by allowing single return for both federal and provincial taxes.
 The member said at present the tax machinery is focusing on reforms which are directly linked with revenue generation.
 Talking about withholding tax collection on motor vehicle registration / transfer, the member hoped that the issue would be resolved in a meeting of Sindh Chief Minister and Prime Minister’s Adviser on Finance and Revenue. A day earlier a meeting was held between the minister and FBR chairman but it remained inconclusive.
 The FBR last month constituted a committee to iron out differences with Sindh tax authority over revenue collection from motor vehicles in the province. The provincial motor vehicle authority collects tax as withholding agent on registration of new motor vehicles and transfer of registration. It collects withholding tax under the Income Tax Ordinance 2001.
 Sindh excise, taxation and narcotics control department discontinued the collection of withholding tax from July 1 in line with a decision of Sindh cabinet last year. The FBR said the obligation to withhold or collect taxes has no relation with Article 146 of the constitution, which could have applied if power to legislate or to administer tax law was delegated to the provinces.
 On a question on tax relief to low cost housing, the FBR official said a comprehensive package has already been announced by the government. People engaged in construction sector could benefit from the tax concessions under the relief package.
 Under the package, a fixed tax regime for builders and developers has been introduced besides one time exemption from questioning from source of investment has also been allowed under the package.

“Our priority is to get state of the art technology in the best possible indigenisation,” said Khan chairing a Progress Review meeting on PSDP Plus here in the federal capital.
 The deputy chairman said Public Private Partnership Authority (PPPA) would only consider complex proposals that required high order thinking and analysis, proposals with viability gaps, and should exclude any routine projects for which other financial mediums were available.
 While reviewing the projects presented by the Government of Punjab, DCPC directed that in addition to the infrastructure projects, Punjab should also concentrate on projects related to agriculture sector, service provisions, private cattle markets and other rich resources available to gain better economic productivity.
 According to official statement, Government of KP presented proposals for establishment of tourists’ resorts and informed that their feasibility studies are being worked upon.
 Responding to KP’s proposals, Khan said tourism was all about marketing therefore qualified international consultants needed to be hired.
 “The request for proposal must include references, relevant capabilities and track record. For seeking high quality consultants, embassies and missions should also be kept in parallel,” the DCPC said. Further, he said the federal government had given special importance to Balochistan in the PSDP projects and in the same spirit it would like to go an extra mile for the province in PSDP Plus. He also directed the PPPA to identify viable projects for Balochistan province after consultation with its government.
 Secretary Planning Mathar Niaz Rana, CEO PPP Authority Malik Ahamd, Provincial Chief Secretaries, representative from PM Office, and senior officials of the Planning Commission were also present in the meeting.

Nevertheless, we were able to achieve an operating break even in all regions. Despite travel restrictions and social distancing, our employees continued to provide customers with the best possible service and adapted flexibly to the rapidly changing market environment.

FRANKFORT, Ky. (KT) - A record number of daily cases of the coronavirus was reported on Wednesday with more than a thousand, along with the deaths of seven more Kentuckians.
 Gov. Andy Beshear had mentioned on Monday, when there were only 245 new cases, that the lower number had to be taken with a grain of salt. He noted that a technical issue with the state’s data processor caused a delay in some reporting, leading to lower numbers that would be updated later this week.
 That happened on Wednesday, as 1,163 new cases were reported, 39 of which involved children five years of age and younger. When all duplicates were removed, that brings the number of cases in Kentucky to 36,945. Despite the high number of new cases, because of the large quantity of tests performed, the state’s positivity rate actually dropped to 5.62, based on a rolling seven-day average.

The Company advises that, in light of low visibility for the coming months, current growth rates should not be extrapolated for the remainder of the year. Westwing's guidance reflects this currently high volatility in growth rates and uncertainty around economic outlook/consumer sentiment for the remainder of the year and expects 25-35% revenue growth at 3-5% Adj EBITDA margin for the full year 2020.

It has been a month since our mid-July GOP runoff for the U.S. Senate and two open congressional seats. Since then, numerous publications as well as many of you have asked me to analyze and assess the outcomes.
   
 In the Senate runoff between Tommy Tuberville and Jeff Sessions the outcome can be explained in one word, "Trump." It is that simple. Coach Tuberville read the playbook, perfectly, and stayed on script. Alabama is Trump Country. President Trump may very well replicate or exceed his 63% 2016 landslide vote in the Heart of Dixie come fall. All Coach Tuberville needs to do is keep doing the same thing. Simply say, "I'm Trump's man, and I will have his back."
   
 Tuberville's Democratic opponent, Doug Jones, has a lot of left-wing money from California that will help our Alabama TV and radio stations and hopefully, newspapers make a lot of money, but it will be for naught. It might allow Jones to get over the traditional 40% threshold for a Democrat in Alabama, but it is tough for a Democrat to win in Alabama, especially in a presidential election year.
   
 With all that money, Jones will try to tell Alabamians that he is not a liberal, yellow-dog Democrat, but he is. They will also attack Tuberville unmercifully, personally. Tuberville should not take the bait. He needs to keep his head down and defuse the assaults and march on simply saying, "I'm Trump's man." Under no circumstances should he debate. It only gives Jones credibility.
   
 All Tuberville has to say is that Jones has voted straight down the line with his liberal Democratic friends and colleagues on every major issue. He needs to emphasize that Jones joined his Democratic bedfellows Nancy Pelosi and the California Democrats in the vote to impeach Donald Trump and against Trump's conservative Supreme Court appointments. Jones and his California team will try to make the race about personalities, Jones versus Tuberville.
   
 However, at the end of the day, Tuberville really does not even have to campaign. On Nov. 3, it will be a choice between Donald Trump and Tommy Tuberville with a big "R" on top of their names or Joe Biden, Nancy Pelosi, and Doug Jones with a big "D" on top of their names. Folks, there is no doubt who will win that fight in the Heart of Dixie.
   
 In the congressional races, the story was about the Club for Growth. This is an ultra-right-wing group of rich men, who have decided they wanted to spend a lot of money in Republican primaries around the country. For some reason, Alabama's two open congressional seats in the 1st and 2nd districts attracted these Club for Growth Daddy Warbucks. They wanted to boast that they captured a seat. They bought them one in the 2nd district, but they lost in their attempt to buy the 1st district.
   
 The winner of the 1st district race, the Mobile-Baldwin seat, was won by Jerry Carl. He is a normal pro-business Republican. The right-wing Club for Growth spent over $1 million dollars trying to elect Carl's opponent, Bill Hightower. Jerry Carl must be one tough, well-thought-of Mobilian to overcome that onslaught of money.
   
 In the 2nd district the Club for Growth orchestrated the most amazing comeback upset I have ever seen. Dothan businessman Jeff Coleman spent over $2 million of his own money and raised another $2 million from Main Street conservative groups, like Chambers of Commerce and farmers' groups. This financial advantage propelled Coleman to what looked like a prohibitive lead in the first primary on March 3.
   
 It looked like a cakewalk for Coleman. His opponent was a relatively unknown former state representative named Barry Moore, who barely made it into the runoff. Undoubtedly, the Club for Growth polled the district and saw they could beat Coleman - the mainstream, pro-business Republican. They blindsided him with a million dollars of negative ads and brochures the last three weeks of the campaign.
   
 A million dollars in three weeks in the very inexpensive Montgomery-Dothan media market is insurmountable. Their ads were well designed, vicious, and yes, disingenuous and they worked. The Club for Growth bought themselves a congressional seat. However, they will get very little bang for their buck. Moore will be in Congress two years, then gone. Alabama probably is going to lose a seat to California after this year's census. In 2022, we will go from seven seats to six. This district likely is the one that will be one on the chopping block. If indeed our 2nd congressional district moves to California, maybe Doug Jones can run for it. His voting record will sell on the left coast.

Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS) data on Wednesday showed that all the key economic sectors showed downtrend in the last fiscal 2019/20.
 LSM showed a significant 16.8 percent growth in June over May due to easing lockdown related to coronavirus and base effect with manufacturing staying restricted since late March. The partial ease in lockdown from early June pushed the business ahead.
 However, LSM output decreased 7.7 percent year-on-year in June, triggered by declining industrialisation across the board.
 LSM growth target for FY20 was set at 3.1 percent. The output also moved in reverse direction of the FY2019’s target with big industry having dipped 2.3 percent as opposed to the annual target of 8.1 percent. The decline was the first contraction in a decade.
 Dismal LSM growth was collectively dragging the economic growth to lower trajectory. Growth faltered to 0.4 percent last fiscal from 3.3 percent a year ago.
 Analysts have been warning the government of de-industrialisation for two years.
 Declining LSM dragged down overall growth of the industrial sector, according to the Planning Commission.
 “The contraction may also be attributed to subdued demand owing to double digit inflation during the year and completion of first phase of CPEC which resulted in slowdown in infrastructure related investment,” the commission said the annual plan 2020/21 report. “On supply side, rupee devaluation, import duties and taxes levied in budget 2019/20 increased the cost of imported inputs especially in automobile, electronics and pharmaceutical sectors. The pandemic of COVID-19 also intensified economic miseries of the industrial sector in particular.”
 All the three data collection authorities registered decrease in production last fiscal year. Ministry of industries, measuring output trend of 36 items, recorded a 7.43 percent decline in production. Provincial bureau of statistics, counting production of 65 products, logged 1.53 percent negative growth. Oil Companies Advisory Council, logging outputs of 11 oil and petroleum products, measured fall of 1.21 percent.
 PBS data showed that sugar production fell 7.2 percent in FY2020. Steel output also showed double digit decline as construction industry couldn’t resume full-fledged operation due to unfulfilled commitments. Manufacturing of trucks, tractors, buses, cars and motorcycles declined year-over-year.
 Production of diesel fell 40 percent year-over-year in FY2020, followed by solvant naptha (30.6pc), lubricant oil (29.3pc), jet fuel oil (29pc), kerosene oil (23pc), furnace oil (23pc), and motor spirits (13pc).

INDIANAPOLIS  -- There was always going to be an Indianapolis 500 this year --with full attendance, limited attendance or, where Indianapolis Motor Speedway finally landed, with no fans at all.  
 The race is simply too important to become yet another 2020 cancellation, even if it means closing the gates for the first time in 104 years.  
 The garages open Wednesday for the "Greatest Spectacle in Racing," an event long woven into the nation's fabric as a Memorial Day weekend celebration. There have been only two pauses in race history, during World War I in 1917 and 1918, then from 1942-45 during World War II.  
 The pandemic pushed the race off its traditional date to Aug. 23, and new owner Roger Penske and the speedway staff will do their very best to honor the tradition of the treasured event.  
 Penske earlier said he would pull the plug on the race if fans could not attend, and he tried, all the way until last week, to open the gates to his new showplace. There was an 88-page plan along with confidence the Indy 500 could safely socially distance 25% attendance at the sprawling speedway with more than 250,000 seats.  
 Ultimately, the coronavirus was deemed too dangerous for Penske to expose himself, the speedway or the community that has supported the Indy 500 since 1911.  
 The race itself? It is critical to the survival of IndyCar beyond being a a source of pride for the state of Indiana.  
 "There was no way we were not going to run the race. That was never going to be an option," Penske said.  
 When he said he wouldn't hold the race without spectators, the pandemic looked different in Indiana and surrounding Marion County.  
 "The numbers started to go the wrong way," Penske said. "I think the world has changed, the state has changed, the city has changed, Marion County has changed from when I said that. Typically you make your best decision on the information you have."  
 The financial numbers have got to be horrific for Penske, who in January bought IMS from the Hulman-George family that had owned the national landmark since 1945. Penske's businesses are private companies, so whatever losses he's taken are not public. It's believed he paid about $300 million for the speedway, the IndyCar Series and the Indy 500, and he's spent another $15 million on capital improvements.  
 He's cut the purse in half for the Indy 500, a reversal from February when he pledged an additional $2 million to make a $15 million pot. Penske is undoubtedly bleeding money from the purchase, which makes him responsible for both the race and with helping IndyCar team owners survive.  
 The Indy 500 is certain to be a massive money loser for Penske, who remains pragmatic about the losses.  
 "This isn't a 2020 investment and then we are getting out. Our family can own this for the next 75 years," Penske said. "The financial impact is what it is. I've worked hard to build a company that's got a solid base and that's why we bought the track. There are always speed bumps you deal with in business and this is one that is unexpected, but all four wheels are still on the car."  
 Plans call for as normal an Indy 500 as possible. Both the national anthem and "Back Home Again in Indiana" will be live, and a flyover is in the works.  
 Penske hasn't said who will give the command to start the engines, an honor traditionallly held by either the late Tony Hulman or "the family" since 1946, the first Indy 500 held after Hulman rescued a speedway abandoned during the war.  
 Alas, there will be no pre-race balloon release, and the cannon blast inside the speedway will not go off at 6 a.m., a longtime tradition to signify race day has finally arrived. The Purdue marching band didn't make the cut as essential personnel, the infield Snake Pit is closed and Carb Day has been stripped down to just a single practice session. The parade through downtown Indianapolis has also been canceled.  
 The central Indiana television blackout has been lifted for just the third time. The blackout has always been a nudge for the community to attend the race; this year, the speedway needs fans to stay home.  
 The driver introductions will still be done for the NBC Sports broadcast and the network still plans to present a full, pre-race show. Traditional elements such of the Color Guard, including the rifle salute, playing of "Taps" and a military tribute are planned.  
 There are 33 driver confirmations so at this point no "Bump Day" dramatics are expected. There isn't cash during a pandemic for teams to field additional entries and drivers on the open market can't find the funding to buy a ride.  
 Fernando Alonso, the two-time Formula One champion w ho missed the race last year in a botched effort by McLaren, completed his deal to try again before the pandemic. Same with three-time Indy 500 winner Helio Castroneves, who has a deal with Penske, and former winner Tony Kanaan, who isn't racing full-time this year and is hopeful the Indy 500 will remain on his schedule in 2021 as he moves toward semi-retirement.  
 Had those drivers not closed deals to race this year before the pandemic, three of the biggest names in the Indy 500 could have been sidelined by funding issues. Pippa Mann couldn't secure financing and the Indy 500 won't have a female driver in the field for the first time since 1999.  
 At least there will be a race.  
 "I just can't wait to be there to see the cars get on the track, having the chance to see them coming down the straightaway at 200-plus mph, it will be a dream come true for me," said Penske. "I can't wait to see the smiles when the track opens. Well, I won't see the smiles under the masks, but I know everyone will be smiling to be here."

Bay Area residents are about to enter their sixth month of living under a pandemic-related health order of one form or another, and there are indications that some are growing weary of complying with an evolving set of restrictions.
 Locally, businesses already facing any number of challenges are reporting a small but persistent percentage of customers who actively resist wearing a face covering in situations where they are required by county health order. Their actions put business owners in the uncomfortable position of having to either convince the customer to comply or turn paying customers away.
 One business, 311 Oak Street Pub in downtown Brentwood, recently took to social media with a message for customers and potential customers stating that those who cannot or will not follow the rules will be asked to leave. Niki Venoble, manager of 311 Oak Street Pub, said that dealing with customers who refuse to wear a mask is a daily occurrence.
 “There’s a lot of people that are just over the whole situation, and they don’t want to follow the rules anymore regardless of what they are,” she said. “They’re the ones we were having a little bit more problem with. Whether we feel the same way or not, to keep this business operating, we have to follow the rules. That was where we just had to start laying down the law and it came to the point where if you don’t value this business enough to follow the rules that we have to follow, then unfortunately you have to go somewhere else right now.”
 Health officials at every level have urged the use of face coverings since the start of the pandemic. Their required use in the county didn’t start until Contra Costa Health Services (CCHS) issued Order No. HO-COVID19-22 on July 5. That order required wearing a face covering when within six feet of a person who is not a household member and when waiting in line to enter a business. It also placed the responsibility on business owners to: prohibit anyone not wearing a mask from entering the business; refuse service to anyone not wearing a face covering and attempt to remove anyone not wearing a mask from the premises.
 CCHS issued additional regulations for outdoor dining less than a week later in an appendix to the general shelter-in-place order. It required that customers wear a face covering while on the premises except while eating or drinking. That included while ordering, before the meal and drinks are served and while moving to or from the table.
 “The rules keep changing,” Venoble said. “There’s nobody there to tell us what they are. It’s our responsibility to go out and search for these rules. There’s so many places to search it’s very unclear what to follow.”
 Down the street at Brentwood Craft Beer and Cider, co-owner Joey Nardone said the majority of customers there readily comply with the rules, but there are exceptions.
 “A small percentage of people, just a few each day, will not want to approach the checkout table with a mask, will not want to come into the building to use the restroom with a mask,” he said. “They don’t want to do business with us if they have to follow any of the rules set forth by the state and the county. They simply walk away.”
 Arguing with customers is time consuming for Nardone and his staff, and he said it impacts the morale of his business’ 14 employees. But failure to enforce the health order means risking fines and a potential loss of his business license. It also presents a health risk to his employees and other customers.
 “We don’t want to argue with anybody,” Nardone said. “We’re very customer- friendly. We’re customer-service oriented. We’re here to serve people and give you what you need and want. But then when you argue with us over something we can’t control, you’re wasting everybody’s time and you’re bringing down our spirit. It’s just not good for the vibe. It’s not a good thing.”
 Around the corner at Roadees Cafe, Cherie and Chandra Mathews have had a different experience. They report having had no problems with customers attempting to skirt the rules.
 “I would say our customers are pretty good about it,” Chandra Mathews said. “If they don’t have a mask, they usually wait outside to be respectful to the other customers. Most people have masks, though. Everyone keeps their six-foot distance. I would say, overall, we haven’t had any issues.”
 With no end to the pandemic in sight, it’s likely that business owners will be dealing with this issue into the foreseeable future.
 “I wish (people) would understand that if they want us to be around when all of this is said and done, they have to follow the rules now,” Venoble said. “Or else, they’re not going to have their favorite watering hole or their new favorite lunch venue to come to. It’s a constant battle.”

Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS) data on Wednesday showed that all the key economic sectors showed downtrend in the last fiscal 2019/20.
 LSM showed a significant 16.8 percent growth in June over May due to easing lockdown related to coronavirus and base effect with manufacturing staying restricted since late March. The partial ease in lockdown from early June pushed the business ahead.
 However, LSM output decreased 7.7 percent year-on-year in June, triggered by declining industrialisation across the board.
 LSM growth target for FY20 was set at 3.1 percent. The output also moved in reverse direction of the FY2019’s target with big industry having dipped 2.3 percent as opposed to the annual target of 8.1 percent. The decline was the first contraction in a decade.
 Dismal LSM growth was collectively dragging the economic growth to lower trajectory. Growth faltered to 0.4 percent last fiscal from 3.3 percent a year ago.
 Analysts have been warning the government of de-industrialisation for two years.
 Declining LSM dragged down overall growth of the industrial sector, according to the Planning Commission.
 “The contraction may also be attributed to subdued demand owing to double digit inflation during the year and completion of first phase of CPEC which resulted in slowdown in infrastructure related investment,” the commission said the annual plan 2020/21 report. “On supply side, rupee devaluation, import duties and taxes levied in budget 2019/20 increased the cost of imported inputs especially in automobile, electronics and pharmaceutical sectors. The pandemic of COVID-19 also intensified economic miseries of the industrial sector in particular.”
 All the three data collection authorities registered decrease in production last fiscal year. Ministry of industries, measuring output trend of 36 items, recorded a 7.43 percent decline in production. Provincial bureau of statistics, counting production of 65 products, logged 1.53 percent negative growth. Oil Companies Advisory Council, logging outputs of 11 oil and petroleum products, measured fall of 1.21 percent.
 PBS data showed that sugar production fell 7.2 percent in FY2020. Steel output also showed double digit decline as construction industry couldn’t resume full-fledged operation due to unfulfilled commitments. Manufacturing of trucks, tractors, buses, cars and motorcycles declined year-over-year.
 Production of diesel fell 40 percent year-over-year in FY2020, followed by solvant naptha (30.6pc), lubricant oil (29.3pc), jet fuel oil (29pc), kerosene oil (23pc), furnace oil (23pc), and motor spirits (13pc).

Funding body cameras for the sheriff's department was considered to be a key first step toward building trust in law enforcement through transparency. It became a hot-button topic in early June in the aftermath of the Memorial Day killing of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer.
 In light of nationwide outrage, body cams are the bridge to officer accountability.
