The blood plasma, taken from patients who have recovered from the coronavirus and rich in antibodies, may provide benefits to those battling the disease. But the evidence so far has not been conclusive about whether it works, when to administer it and what dose is needed.
 In a letter describing the emergency authorization, the chief scientist for the FDA, Denise Hinton, said: “COVID-19 convalescent plasma should not be considered a new standard of care for the treatment of patients with COVID-19. Additional data will be forthcoming from other analyses and ongoing, well- controlled clinical trials in the coming months.”
 But Trump had made clear to aides that he was eager to showcase good news in the battle against the virus, and the timing allowed him to head into his convention with momentum. He and aides billed it as a “major" development and used the White House briefing room to make the announcement.
 Trump also displayed some rare discipline in the evening news conference, sticking to his talking points, deferring to the head of the FDA, Stephen Hahn, and only taking three questions from reporters.
 The White House had grown agitated with the pace of the plasma approval. The accusations of an FDA slowdown, which were presented without evidence, were just the latest assault from Trump’s team on what he refers to as the “deep state” bureaucracy. White House chief of staff Mark Meadows did not deal in specifics, but said that “we’ve looked at a number of people that are not being as diligent as they should be in terms of getting to the bottom of it.”
 “This president is about cutting red tape,” Meadows said in an interview Sunday on “This Week" on ABC. “He had to make sure that they felt the heat. If they don’t see the light, they need to feel the heat because the American people are suffering.”
 During Sunday’s 18-minute press conference, Trump said he thought there had been a “logjam” at the FDA over granting the emergency authorization. He alleged there are people at the FDA “that can see things being held up ... and that’s for political reasons.”
 Dr. Joshua Sharfstein said the statement, and Hahn’s silence while Trump said it, “was disgraceful.”
 “The FDA commissioner basically allowed the president to mischaracterize the decision and attack the integrity of FDA employees. I was horrified,” said Sharfstein, a vice dean at John Hopkins University’s school of public health who was a top FDA official during the Obama administration.
 “This is a promising therapy that has not been fully established,” he said
 The push on Sunday came a day after Trump tweeted sharp criticism on the process to treat the virus, which has killed more than 175,000 Americans and imperiled his reelection chances. The White House has sunk vast resources into an expedited process to develop a vaccine, and Trump aides have been banking on it being an “October surprise” that could help the president make up ground in the polls.
 “The deep state, or whoever, over at the FDA is making it very difficult for drug companies to get people in order to test the vaccines and therapeutics,” Trump tweeted. "Obviously, they are hoping to delay the answer until after November 3rd. Must focus on speed, and saving lives!”
 Earlier this month, Mayo Clinic researchers reported a strong hint that blood plasma from COVID-19 survivors helps other infected patients recover. But it wasn’t considered proof.
 More than 70,000 patients in the U.S. have been given convalescent plasma, a century-old approach to fend off flu and measles before vaccines. It’s a go-to tactic when new diseases come along, and history suggests it works against some, but not all, infections.

Bloomberg) -- Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko vowed new steps to crack down on opponents after more demonstrations against his 26-year rule brought tens of thousands of people in to the streets of the capital and other cities over the weekend demanding his resignation.


  Police detained two members of the opposition’s coordinating council in Minsk Monday as they sought to organize a strike at one of the country’s largest factories.


  On Sunday, more than 100,000 people gathered in and around Independence Square in Minsk, despite phalanxes of riot police and barbed-wire barricades spread across the city. Police patrols on main highways leading to Minsk slowed incoming traffic, making it harder for protesters from other parts of the country to reach the capital.


  Lukashenko was shown on state television flying into his Minsk residence in a helicopter carrying an automatic rifle and clad in a bullet-proof vest, with his 15-year-old son, similarly armed, in tow. He basked in pledges of support from riot police guarding the residence.


  The former Soviet collective farm boss is confronting the biggest challenge to his rule after claiming a landslide in the Aug. 9 election, which triggered protests and international condemnation of the vote. Opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, who fled to Lithuania after the results, has been spurring followers to take to the streets, while urging foreign powers not to intervene.


  Russia, Belarus’ closest ally, warned Western countries to stay out of the conflict after congratulating Lukashenko on his election victory. The U.S. and EU have denounced that vote. U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Stephen Biegun is in Lithuania Monday to discuss the situation. He meets Russian officials Tuesday in Moscow.


  Kremlin Concern


  The Kremlin is still concerned by signs of “external intervention in Belarus’ affairs,” spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Monday, declining to specify what countries he was referring to. He said that the Kremlin is not in contact with the opposition’s coordinating council and that to do so would amount to intervention on the part of Russia. While he conceded that opposition leaders haven’t made anti-Russian statements, he said the Kremlin remains more impressed with politicians in Belarus who support closer ties with Moscow.


  The opposition that backed Tikhanovskaya’s bid for the presidency is seeking to reassure Russia that any change of power wouldn’t necessarily push Belarus closer to the European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.


  Russia signaled on Sunday that it isn’t convinced. Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov accused Tikhanovskaya of harboring an allegedly anti-Russian political agenda, telling a forum near Moscow that he also supports a constitutional reform plan by Lukashenko as “very promising.”


  Opposition groups call that offer inadequate.


  Lukashenko’s government has sought to play up the geopolitical stakes in the conflict. Monday, the Defense Ministry said its helicopters repulsed an incursion by eight balloons carrying anti-government slogans from NATO-member Lithuania.


  Supporters of the protests there had gathered near the border and released the balloons. Lithuania, for its part, accused the Belarusian helicopters of violating its airspace, according to a statement from its Foreign Ministry.


  Strike Calls


  In Belarus, opposition leaders have called on workers across the country to go on strike to build pressure on the regime, while Lukashenko vowed to shut any factories where work stoppages took place. Two leaders of the strike movement at the Minsk Tractor Plant, known as MTZ, were detained Monday, the opposition said. The two are also members of the coordinating council that Tikhanovskaya has formed for dialog with the regime.


  Efforts to broaden the strikes appeared to be struggling under pressure from management and the security services. “It’s Brownian motion to which we are trying to bring some order,” said Siarhei Antusevich, Deputy Chairman of Belarusian Congress of Democratic Trade Unions, which is trying to organize strike committees into a single national entity.


  After an extremely brutal crackdown on protesters in the first days following the vote failed to scotch the opposition movement, Lukashenko has stuck mainly to shows of force, with riot police not confronting protesters and military drills on his western border, and public derision for his critics.


  Lukashenko “is sure that he can rewind to the beginning, let the protests blow off steam, punish some and intimidate others and return his old control over the country,” political analyst Artem Shraibman wrote on the Tut.by news website Monday. “That’s another illusion but to recognize that, Lukashenko will need new, more convincing signs that the country he’s used to no longer exists.”

--DocBreak--
Bloomberg) -- Driverless car startup Luminar Technologies Inc., backed by tech billionaire Peter Thiel, is going public via a $3.4 billion merger with blank-check company Gores Metropoulos Inc., bolstering efforts to get its laser sensors onto the production lines of global automakers.


  The deal will be paid for with $400 million in cash from the blank-check company, as well as $170 million from other investors including Thiel, a unit of Volvo Car AB and GoPro Inc. founder Nick Woodman.


  Luminar is the latest entity to merge with a special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC. The investment vehicles have gone mainstream this year, offering a faster route for startups seeking to go public without the scrutiny or risks of an initial public offering.


  Led by 25-year-old Chief Executive Officer Austin Russell, Luminar has emerged from a crowded startup field by bringing down the cost of lidar sensors, which bounce lasers off objects to guide vehicles. The cost of the sensors can run into the tens of thousands of dollars and has been a stumbling block for companies looking to compete in the self-driving car race.


  In May, Volvo said it will use Luminar’s technology to enable hands-free highway driving in cars starting in 2022.


  Russell said he chose to go public earlier than expected because, amid uncertainty caused by the coronavirus, the boom in blank-check company dealmaking offered a more secure way to access funds than an IPO.


  “By the time this is over, we will have brought in north of $500 million -- that allows us to make these kinds of strategic investments and additionally accelerate our programs and timelines and customer adoption,” Russell said by phone.


  Luminar is aiming to first sell its sensors for advanced-safety features in passenger cars and driverless trucks, rather than fully autonomous fleets of robotaxis, Russell said.


  Gores Metropoulos is backed by Alec Gores’ Los Angeles-based private equity firm Gores Group LLC and Dean Metropoulos, a veteran investor in the consumer space.


  Gores, who’s the CEO of Gores Metropoulos, said Austin developed the only lidar technology that meets the most stringent safety specifications of carmakers, and he did so from scratch. “Luminar is well-positioned to dominate the autonomous landscape,” he added.


  Luminar and its existing investors will end up keeping about 80% of the company as part of the deal, and Gores Metropoulos will own about 11%, Russell said.


  Gores Metropoulos raised $400 million, including so-called greenshoe shares, in an initial public offering in February 2019. Its shares closed Friday at $10.51, giving it a market value of $525.5 million.


  Auto tech companies have benefited from the boom in blank-check deals, as investors who might have earlier favored traditional IPOs now seek businesses with higher growth.


  In June, another company that makes sensors used in self-driving vehicles, Velodyne Lidar Inc., announced a deal to merge with blank-check company Graf Industrial Corp.


  After the deal closes, Luminar will be traded on the Nasdaq Select Market under the ticker LAZR.

A video of the incident shows Taylor following Lee in the cell block and removing the rod from his clothing, then hitting Lee in the back of the head with it, the complaint states. Lee then fell to the floor.
 As a result of the attack, the housing unit “was in an uproar,” the report states. The corrections officer on duty on that block reported that his call for a lockdown failed, and he called for a “Code Black,” for a riot or major disturbance.
 The jail unit where those inmates were housed has been on lockdown since the incident occurred, meaning that all of the inmates are confined to and locked into their cells.
 A shift commander reported that the jail was still on lockdown Sunday and was expected to remain under that status until re-evaluation on Monday.
 Deputy warden Jason Hilton said at the Lawrence County county prison board meeting last week that the fight broke out around 11:30 a.m. Aug. 17. Initially, a code yellow was called, meaning there was fighting between two inmates. The fight escalated to the code black when a third inmate joined the fray, he said.
 All four corrections officers who were on duty responded to the cell block, along with Hilton and Warden Brian Covert, said commissioner Loretta Spielvogel, who is prison board chairwoman.
 Taylor was placed in the jail’s restrictive housing unit after the incident and is to have an in-house conduct hearing this week, according to Hilton.
 Hilton said he doesn’t know how Taylor got the metal rod.

Last week, Behzadi and his wife, Mary, celebrated the opening of the restaurant with a ribbon cutting event hosted by the Marion County Chamber of Commerce and Main Street Fairmont.


  Mama Di Roma officially opened in June, and Behzadi said opening a new restaurant in the middle of a pandemic was itself a challenge.


  "It was very challenging because of the pandemic and what's going on, but we were determined to make it," he said.


  Tim Liebrecht, executive director of the Main Street Fairmont, helped welcome the restaurant to Fairmont, and said the addition of a new Italian eatery adds new variety to downtown.


  "Mama Di Roma — great food," Liebrecht said. "We appreciate you guys being part of our revitalization of downtown. Coming in in the middle of a pandemic of all things, thank you so much. We welcome you with open arms and we just congratulate you on the opening of this amazing restaurant."


  Jonathan Board, chair of the Chamber of Commerce's board of directors, presented a certificate to the owners for their persistence in opening the restaurant despite the challenges.

With one out in the eighth, George Springer lifted a fly ball to shallow left. Tatis raced after it and, with his blond dreadlocks flying behind him, leaped to make the catch. His momentum carried him several more yards. Springer couldn't believe it and reliever Craig Stammen (3-1) clapped twice for the shortstop.
 "Oh man, it's just great being able to make that play for my pitcher and the rest of the team, too," said Tatis, who grew up in "The Cradle of Shortstops," San Pedro de Macoris, Dominican Republic. "What can I say, I just saw the ball and I just went after it and my body took care of it."
 At first, Tatis didn't think he'd get to the ball. "I saw it had a little too much air, but the fact I never gave up on it and thank God for my speed and I got there," he said.
 Rookie manager Jayce Tingler was wide-ranging in his praise for the 6-foot-3 Tatis, whose father played in the major leagues for 11 seasons and raised his son in the game.
 "The ground he covered on the Springer ball, he looks like an NFL No. 1 receiver going out on a high-corner fade and just going to make that play," the manager said.
 "We've got a No. 1 NFL receiver. We've got a point guard in the NBA. We've got a world-class FIFA soccer player, maybe an anchor on a 4x4 Olympic team," Tingler continued. "We're just blessed that he was born in the Dominican and grew up playing baseball. He's a freak. The other thing, too, is how driven this guy is to not only be a great player, I think driven to be a champion, but more importantly, he wants to bring a World Series to the city of San Diego."
 Tatis led off the bottom of the inning and singled to right-center ahead of Machado's eighth homer.
 In the fifth, Tatis made a spinning stop of Jose Altuve's grounder to start an inning-ending double play.
 The Padres, who got to nemesis Zack Greinke in the fourth inning, have won seven straight, all against the two Texas teams. The Astros have lost three straight. They came in on an eight-game winning streak.
 The Padres weren't able to add on to their "Slam Diego" power display of the past week. On Saturday night, they became the first team in big league history to hit five grand slams in six games. They were also the first to hit a grand slam in four straight games, a streak started by Tatis on Monday night at Texas and continued by Machado with a walkoff grand slam Wednesday night at home against the Rangers.
 The Padres never loaded the bases Sunday.
 "We couldn't keep them in the ballpark," Astros manager Dusty Baker said. "I don't know what the number was but they outhomered us 10-2 or 9-3 and that makes it difficult when you can't keep them in the ballpark."

Speaking to the Neue Zürcher Zeitung newspaper on Monday, Narasimhan said Covid-19 is posing more problems than expected with a series of waves striking various countries.


  “The question is: When will we be so far advanced with vaccines and treatments that the world can live with the virus? We are not assuming that it will suddenly go away or that enough people will be immune,” he said.


  In April, Narasimhan appeared optimistic about the chances of anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine providing relief from the virus. But the drug, which was endorsed by US President Donald Trump, did not pass muster with the World Health Organization (WHO).


  “We are at a very early stage and it turns out that it is taking longer than we expected,” he said of finding a cure. “We hoped to be able to get more out of the existing drugs for combating Covid and also to be faster in developing a new active ingredient. Now it is clear that we need more cooperation with biotech companies.”

The incident was reported to the Prison Board at its meeting Wednesday.
 District Attorney Joshua Lamancusa, who did not attend the board meeting, said the entire incident was recorded on surveillance video.
 Taylor as a result of the reported attack is charged with aggravated assault causing serious bodily injury, aggravated assault causing bodily injury with a deadly weapon, assault by prisoner, possessing instrument of crime with intent, making repairs to an offensive weapon and recklessly endangering another person.
 He was arraigned Friday by District Judge Melissa A. Amodie, who set an additional jail bond of $25,000.
 Taylor in May was charged with aggravated burglary in Canton, Ohio, after he and two others assaulted a woman there on April 30, during a drug deal that turned violent, according to police. Taylor and the other two are facing charges in Ohio in the incident. That offense in Ohio occurred after Taylor escaped from house arrest in March in Lawrence County.
 Taylor was charged with escape by the Lawrence County sheriff’s department because he had cut off his ankle bracelet between April 8 and May 2, and fled Lawrence County while still on house arrest from previous convictions, according to a court papers.
 He had pleaded guilty to one count of recklessly endangering another person in a shooting incident outside of Taggart Stadium during a youth football game in 2018. He also pleaded guilty to simple assault in a case in which he was accused of assaulting a woman in a car. He was sentenced in December to a year in prison, plus probation, but had already served part of that time in jail before sentencing. The judge had ordered him to serve the remainder of his sentence on house arrest.
 His escape charge is still pending in the Lawrence County Court of Common Pleas.
 Lee was sentenced Aug. 6 to 8 to 16 months in the Lawrence County jail, after he pleaded guilty on a drug trafficking charge.

  # Protest erupts after Wisconsin police shoot man; gov vows action


  Associated Press


  View Comments


  _Kenosha, Wis._ – Officers deployed tear gas early Monday to disperse hundreds of people who took to the streets following a police shooting in Kenosha that also drew a harsh rebuke from the governor after a video posted on social media appeared to show officers shoot at a Black man’s back seven times as he leaned into a vehicle.


  A person was hospitalized in serious condition following a shooting by officers about 5 p.m. Sunday as officers were responding to a “domestic incident,” the Kenosha Police Department said in a news release. Police in the city, which is in the southeastern corner of Wisconsin about 40 miles south of Milwaukee and 50 miles north of Chicago, did not provide details about what led to the shooting, but said the person was transported to a hospital in Milwaukee for treatment.


  By late Sunday, multiple vehicles were set ablaze and windows were smashed along city thoroughfares as crowds faced off with law enforcement. Officers in riot gear stood in lines and SWAT vehicles remained on the streets to move people away from city buildings despite the declaration of an overnight curfew. Tear gas was used to disperse groups of people, according to reporters at the scene.


  In video posted on social media that appeared to show the shooting from across a street, three officers could be seen shouting and pointing their weapons at the man as he walked around the front of a parked SUV. As the man opened the driver’s side door and leaned inside, one officer grabbed his shirt from behind and then fired into the vehicle. Seven shots could be heard on the video, though it was unclear if more than one officer fired.


  Gov. Tony Evers on Sunday night condemned the shooting of the man, whom he identified as Jacob Blake, saying in a statement that “while we do not have all of the details yet, what we know for certain is that he is not the first Black man or person to have been shot or injured or mercilessly killed at the hands of individuals in law enforcement in our state or our country.”


  The Wisconsin Department of Justice, which is investigating the shooting, did not release any details about the officers who were involved except to say they had been placed on administrative leave.


  Following the shooting, social media posts showed neighbors gathering in the surrounding streets and shouting at police. Some could be heard chanting “no justice, no peace” while others appeared to throw objects at officers and damage police vehicles.


  Later Sunday, in a scene that mirrored the widespread protests over the police shootings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and other Black people, marchers headed to the Kenosha County Public Safety Building, which houses the police and county sheriff’s departments. Authorities mostly blocked off the building, and some officers were positioned on the roof as protesters marched beside lines of honking cars as they made their way to the building.


  Outside the station, protesters clashed with officers dressed in riot gear, including plastic face masks, who occasionally used their shields and batons to push people back.


  Meanwhile, Evers indicated that he intends to take further action over the shooting.


  “I have said all along that although we must offer our empathy, equally important is our action,” he said. “In the coming days, we will demand just that of elected officials in our state who have failed to recognize the racism in our state and our country for far too long.”

The number of Republicans speaking at the Democratic National Convention had progressives on edge.


  They shouldn’t have fretted. Even if a handful of estranged Republicans are along for the ride, the left is steadily moving the Democratic Party in its direction. Would progressives prefer winning the optics at a virtual convention, or the substance over the longer term?


  The Democratic Convention was, for the most part, bereft of policy, focusing instead on President Donald Trump’s character failings — rehearsed at length — and Joe Biden’s personal decency. Together with all of the speakers with a Republican pedigree, this reinforced Biden’s image of being more moderate than he is, which is perhaps his greatest political strength.

It quickly became obvious he was a playmaker. It was like they couldn't block him. He finished the year with eight tackles, five of them solo, three of them for a loss and had a sack and recovered two fumbles.


  This was the beginning, not the end.


  Last year, he caught Neal Brown's eye enough that he wound up starting three games, playing 500 snaps between defense and special teams.


  Rest assured, offenses started to notice him. Against TCU he had six tackles, four of them without any assistance. Against Baylor he had seven tackles and tied his record of four tackles during that same game. Against Texas Tech, he broke up two passes.


  And if you are getting the idea that he wasn't playing against the big guys, his first start was against Oklahoma and he had five tackles in that game.


  His style is all out, "I'm hitting you before you hit me." He is fearless, if not flawless (who amongst us is flawless?), fast and furious on the field.


  You may wonder why bring this up now?


  It's a good question and there's a good answer.


  We do it because he seems ready to have a big season. After Saturday's first tackling scrimmage of the year, Brown choose to single him out.


  "He had a pick to end a two-minute, end-of-game drill," Brown said. "I've been impressed with him. I think he's shown improvement."


  And that right now is what you look for — improvement.


  That means the player is working, growing, pushing and not only getting physically better but mentally better, and Loe has mental capacities to go with his football capacities, being on the Garrett Ford Academic Honor Roll and the Big 12 Commissioner's Honor Roll.


  There was more, too.


  "He definitely has talent," Brown said. "He's gotten his weight up to where it needs to be. For the last two years he's been one of our best special team players. He made plays on defense today."


  And then Brown closed with this.


  "I'm excited about him."


  You will be too.

The Mayo Clinic reported preliminary data from 35,000 coronavirus patients treated with plasma, and said there were fewer deaths among people given plasma within three days of diagnosis, and also among those given plasma containing the highest levels of virus-fighting antibodies.
 But it wasn’t a formal study. The patients were treated in different ways in hospitals around the country as part of an FDA program designed to speed access to the experimental therapy. That “expanded access” program tracks what happens to the recipients, but it cannot prove the plasma — and not other care they received — was the real reason for improvement.
 Administration officials, in a call with reporters Sunday, discussed a benefit for patients who were within three days of admission to a hospital and were not on a respirator, and were given ‘high-titer’ convalescent plasma containing higher concentrations of antibodies. They were then compared to similar patients who were given lower-titer plasma. The findings suggest deaths were 35% lower in the high-titer group.
 There’s been little data on how effective it is or whether it must be administered fairly early in an illness to make a significant difference, said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious diseases expert at Vanderbilt University.
 Aiming to ward off a possible a run on convalescent plasma after the announcement, government officials have been working to obtain plasma and to team with corporate partners and nonprofit organizations to generate interest among previously infected patients to donate.
 Hahn, who called the development “promising," said Trump did not speak to him about the timing of the announcement. He said “this has been in the works for several weeks.”
 But some health experts were skeptical. Benjamin Corb, of the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, called it “conspicuous timing.”
 “President Trump is once again putting his political goals ahead of the health and well-being of the American public," Corb said.
 Rigorous studies are under way around the country, comparing similar patients randomly assigned to get plasma or a dummy infusion in addition to regular care. But those studies have been difficult to finish as the virus waxes and wanes in different cities. Also, some patients have requested plasma rather than agreeing to a study that might give them a placebo instead.
 Former FDA commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb dismissed the suggestion of a slowdown.
 “I firmly reject the idea they would slow-walk anything or accelerate anything based on any political consideration or any consideration other than what is best for the public health and a real sense of mission to patients,” Gottlieb told CBS's “Face the Nation.”
 Trump, in news conferences, “has made all kinds of therapeutic suggestions” that have not proven to be supported by science — and are even dangerous, Schaffner said. That includes statements about the possible value of treating COVID-19 patients with ultraviolet light and disinfectant. Trump reportedly also recently became enthusiastic about oleandrin, a plant extract derived from a toxic shrub that scientists immediately warned against.
 But the president is perhaps best known for his early and ardent embrace of the malaria drugs hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine.
 Earlier this month, Hahn emphasized that routine evaluation procedures will remain in place to evaluate COVID vaccine candidates.
 “I think this administration has put more pressure on the Food and Drug Administration than I can remember” ever happening in the past, Schaffner said.
 “Everybody is just a little bit nervous,” he said.

The haunting conversation was captured on a cockpit recording device and released Aug. 17 by the National Transportation Safety Board in a 550-page report filed after the investigation of the deadly July 4, 2019 crash that claimed the lives of Cline, Delaney, Jude, 52, Painter, 52, Cline's daughter Kameron, 22, Brittney Searson, 22 and Jillian Clark, 22.


  The seven were killed around 2 miles from the island within a minute of the craft lifting off a concrete pad.


  The document does not establish an official conclusion on the cause of the crash. Investigators are still reviewing the documents and will use them to reach a final conclusion, which officials said could take months.


  But for the parents of those aboard the helicopter on July 4, 2019, the documents provide a detailed look at the final moments of their daughters' lives and raises questions about why it occurred.


  Delaney is the daughter of Paul and Paula Wykle of Beckley.


  Attorneys for the Wykle and Clark families are reviewing the report.


  “Based on what I read, mechanical issues are a concern,” Paul Sterbcow, who along with lawyer Richard Trahant represents the Clarks and Wykles, told the New Orleans Advocate. “And I can say the pilot’s comment at the end leads me to believe at least he thought they were having a problem with their tail rotor system.”


  Clark’s parents, Jeff and Eileen Clark, said Friday they were exasperated that — barring legislative reform — the Death on the High Seas Act may greatly limit damages from any litigation in the case, the New Orleans paper reported.


  The 1920 act generally prohibits survivors of people killed at sea from recovering much compensation beyond funeral costs.


  “This is such an antiquated law,” Jeff Clark said. “It’s a shame we are really having to even fight this battle."


  Delaney, 22, was a longtime friend of Cline's daughter, Kameron who grew up in Beckley and West Palm Beach, Fla., where Cline, a billionaire coal tycoon and beloved philanthropist in Raleigh County, maintained a home.


  Cline kept deep roots and strong bonds in West Virginia, where he donated to colleges, sports organizations and other causes. He was to turn 61 years old on July 5, and he had invited friends, some from the Mountain State, to celebrate on his private island.


  Kameron and Delaney along with Kameron's sorority sisters from Phi Mu were celebrating their college graduations.


  Kameron, Jillian and Brittney had graduated from Louisiana State University.


  Kameron was described as a "loyal friend, compassionate, joyful and smart." She had earned her degree in business administration and finance.


  Delaney had cheered at Park Middle School and attended Woodrow Wilson High School in Beckley. A recent graduate of West Virginia University, she had passed her nursing board examinations a day earlier to become a registered nurse.


  She had a job waiting for her at Raleigh General Hospital's emergency department. She also had a serious boyfriend, Tristan Cornett.


  The Bahamas trip was to be a "girl's" trip, Wykle family friend Tammy Cline (no relation to Chris Cline) told media, a memorable time for the young women before they started jobs and graduate school.


  On July 3, on the island, Delaney was still feeling happy about passing her board exams.


  •••


  Cline and his interior designer had arrived on the island aboard a company, float-equipped Cessna 208 on July 2 to set up for the party, documents show. The same aircraft brought Cline's son and his friends to the island on July 3 and took the designer back to Florida.


  Around 2 p.m. on July 3., Jude flew the young women and friends of Cline's sons in the accident helicopter from Palm Beach International airport in West Palm Beach to the island. Tiffany Jezek, an ER nurse and Cline's friend, was on board, along with a friend of Jezek.


  The 40-minute flight was uneventful. On the island, the party was underway.


  "The beach was set up for celebration," NTSB reported. "People were playing chess, riding Sea-Do's and playing music."


  At the party, Jezek said, she chatted with Delaney who told Jezek she had just passed her nursing boards.


  Jezek also chatted with Kameron, who seemed healthy, and with Clark, Kameron's sorority sister at LSU. Neither girl was drinking, Jezek said.


  Around 10 a.m., Delaney, whom Jezek reported was "very alert," came to tell Jezek that Clark was sick.


  Delaney, Jezek and a physician went to attend to Clark. The girl was drowsy and vomiting, and the three rolled her to her side. Those at the party told Jezek she had not taken drugs. Jezek noted that Clark did not have an "overwhelming smell of alcohol" on her.


  Shane Lerner, Clark's boyfriend, reported that Clark had called him around 10:30 p.m. She had been drinking but did not seem ill, Lerner said in the report. Her health was "phenomenal." He said that Clark, who had plans to attend medical school, had good health. She'd had only a stomach bug on the day before the trip.


  Lerner said whatever had made Clark sick on July 3 must have happened suddenly.


  While the three tended to Clark, Jezek said, Kameron became suddenly ill. She was drowsy and vomiting but did not have slurred speech and did not appear to have as severe symptoms as Clark, Jezek said.


  "At that point, Mr. Cline became concerned and wanted to get the 2 young adults to the United States for medical treatment," the documents report.


  Jezek had vomit on her clothes, so she went back to her bungalow to change. She did not make a diagnosis or know why the girls became ill, she told authorities.


  Robert Hogan, a longtime Cline employee and friend who lived near the concrete pad, said that Cline told him around 11 p.m. that the pilot, Jude, was on his way to Big Grand Cay to get the young women. Hogan said they had heartbeats but that they were groggy and unresponsive. When Cline asked Hogan about going back to the U.S. for medical care, Hogan told him it was best to err on the side of safety, he said.

A rare gem, Raji is a stunning game, lovingly hand-crafted with excellent art: towering statues lit in shafts of light, glowing illustrations on the walls, ancient wall murals and carvings, palaces lit with moody lanterns, the city in the distance, and even beautiful ornate doors with sunlight filtering through stained glasses.


  If you own a Nintendo Switch, Raji lends itself well to hand-held gameplay which has us looking forward to seeing more releases from Nodding Heads.


  For best results, however, it is recommended you play it connected to a TV. If you don’t own a Switch, Raji is slated to launch on PC too, so hopefully it will make a jump into other consoles as well.
