Under Trump, the Department of Interior has limited its NEPA reviews to one year and 150 pages, which may be long for a term paper but not for these highly technical and consequential reports. A study on drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, which Alaska natives have fought against for decades, was criticized by government scientists for omitting possible harms to polar bear habitats and indigenous communities. Trump intends to open the region for drilling anyway. A similarly hurried impact assessment has greenlighted the Pebble Mine, a project previously considered untenable due to the harm it poses to salmon spawning in Alaska’s Bristol Bay. In the Black Hills, three companies are now working with the Forest Service to review prospects for gold mining. As Claudia Nissley, a Colorado-­based corporate NEPA consultant, puts it, Trump’s executive orders “have pushed us back to the old days.”

La situazione attuale ha in pratica accelerato al massimo un processo che era già in atto e sta fornendo ai datori di lavoro, pubblici e privati, una comoda sperimentazione (per il momento a termine) di nuove modalità di organizzazione del lavoro che, in tempi normali, avrebbero avuto molta più difficoltà a concretizzarsi in così breve tempo, e interessando un’area così ampia. Di questa tendenza già si vedono i primi risultati nei dati recentemente pubblicati dal Ministero della funzione pubblica: secondo questi il numero di lavoratori pubblici che attualmente lavorano da casa vanno dalle 395 unità del Molise alle 7.800 della Sicilia, e gli stessi dati mostrano quanto invece sia praticamente inesistente il “telelavoro”.[4]

For Crying Out Loud

In the first hour of economics class, one learns that demand drives supply in a free market society. If enough people want to have breakfast in the evening, restaurants will make it available. This is universally understood to be a good thing. But supply can also drive demand. This is may not be a good thing. If you increase the number of lawyers in an area, you are likely to have more litigation, but not necessarily more justice.
   
 Supply driving demand in criminal justice creates one of those rare public policy issues where both progressives and conservative stalwarts, like the Koch Brothers Foundation, find common ground. If you do nothing but build more prisons, you are going to encourage more incarceration and longer sentences. This can move a non-violent offender in the direction of becoming a career criminal.
   
 Even Mental Health can be adversely affected by supply driving demand. Intellectual Development Disorder (IDD) in children is characterized by deficits in mental functioning such as reasoning, planning, and judgment. Dr. Ed Hammer, retired Professor of Pediatrics at Texas Tech Health Sciences Center, tells me that when additional facilities for treating IDD came on board, there was increased pressure to apply this diagnosis to children who might have otherwise avoided such a label. In some cases, the diagnosis might have sent some children down a residential treatment path that was not to their ultimate benefit, as they were channeled toward using the newly available capacity.
   
 Let's look at how supply driving demand applies to higher education. The national pool of candidates for college admission is shrinking due to historically low birthrates. If the supply of universities places significantly exceeds demand, institutions will have to relax their admission criteria to stay competitive. They will also have to remove financial barriers to attendance with everything from increased Pell grants to the more extreme "Free College for All" ideas currently filling the campaign trail.
   
 If colleges do succeed in filling seats with less qualified candidates, they will be forced to compromise their level of academic rigor to meet these students where they are. If they don't, they will have even more unacceptable non-completion and time-to-completion rates. This will affect all students at an institution, as the classroom discourse will have to be targeted for a lesser level of student preparation. It will also increase the likelihood that students will graduate with fewer marketable skills.
   
 New employers would then face an inflated number of applicants with college degrees. Those degrees would not guarantee that the graduates could do the things that employers need done. Since employers would still rather have a college grad than a high school grad, those without college degrees would now be excluded from competition from jobs for which they previously might have been considered. Lack of confidence in the skill levels of new hires on the part of employers would depress entry-level salaries. Less rigorous college degrees simply would not have the same dollar value on the market. This benefits no one except the marginal colleges that get to stay open. It is particularly disadvantageous to the high-quality student who would have willingly demonstrated excellence in a more demanding college program, if they had had the opportunity.
   
 If there were fewer institutions, each degree would be worth more and be more meaningful to potential employers. It would also reduce taxpayer expense in both the cost of providing undergraduate programs and from government-insured student loans in default.
   
 The problem with reducing the number of public colleges is Reverse NIMBY. If any state wants to build a halfway house for drug addicts, just about everybody will agree that such facilities are needed but may still say "Not In My Back Yard" (NIMBY). If any state sees the need to reduce the number of colleges and universities, citizens are likely to applaud the concept, but engage in special pleading for why the one in their backyard must be spared (Reverse NIMBY). This is only natural in light of the economic benefit a locality gets from its public institutions of higher learning.
   
 Clearly, any program of closings must be methodical and cautious, because it is always easier to close an institution than it would be to bring it back again if needs change. A great deal of attention would need to be paid to how existing facilities could be transitioned to other uses. Appropriate steps must be considered to ameliorate the economic impact on employee families. The most important state responsibility would be to provide for the technical job training needs of those young people for whom the streamlined university system might be a poor fit. They should not and cannot be abandoned.
   
 Closing any public facility, be it an outdated elementary school or a military base, is never easy, but sometimes it is necessary for the greater good. Of course, the benefit to the public of initiating discussions about consolidation would begin long before any actual list would be drawn up, since each institution would likely pay unprecedented attention to its own quality and efficiency in hope of avoiding the list.

In October, Brave spoke at Magpie Buffalo Organizing’s inaugural "No Uranium in Treaty Territory" summit, which offered a crash course on tribal sovereignty. The activists are closely tracking the various Keystone XL permits, which the Rosebud Sioux Tribe is challenging in court as a treaty vio­lation. As the threat of both uranium and gold mining looms, there’s talk of occupying land in the Black Hills, as the American Indian Movement did in 1981.

Adding a layer of oddity to the whole situation, Powertech is so far a mining company only on paper. It has never produced an ounce of ore and can only keep litigating as long as investors remain convinced that footing its bills will eventually pay off. Powertech anticipates the mine will net about $150 million, yet it says it’s already sunk $10 million into the NRC license, not including litigation or staffing costs. Its parent company, Azarga Uranium, trades as an underregulated penny stock; investment firm Haywood Securities rates its risk factor as “very high.”

I have a clear memory of a particular grocery shopping experience with my mom when I was a small child. She had taken me to City Grocery down on the Square in my hometown of Wellington, Texas. This market wasn't large by today's standards. But from the perspective of a 3-year-old, it was a mega Walmart, so I was sure to keep mom in sight.
   
 Maybe it was the cookie aisle that distracted me, I'm not sure. I soon realized, to my horror, that I was following the wrong set of heels. That lady in front of me was not my momma.
   
 I don't remember exactly how it played out. My mom must've realized I wasn't behind her anymore, and things went Code Red for maybe 30 seconds. Happily, I made it out of City Grocery with the right mom and finished growing up with the right parents. But I remember that feeling of separation very well, and the joy of discovering she had not left me to fend for myself.
   
 Now I'm past 50 and still getting mixed up in stores. I also lose my car in the lot quite often. Worse yet, life in general sometimes perplexes me. But thanks to mom, I have an ability to navigate through most situations - a gift she gave me simply by being present and making me feel loved.
   
 I know there were times when it wasn't easy. My mom worked as a teacher for more than 30 years, and she gave those kids the same love and attention she gave us. She worked all day then came home to her own messy kids and bills spread out on the kitchen table. I'm not going to lie and say she always pulled it off like June Cleaver. But my mom kept at it year after year, as she still does, with love guiding her way.
   
 She has applied that same dogged determination to love and be present in everything she does. For the past 50 years she's played either the piano or organ for Sunday services at First Baptist Church in Wellington, not to mention countless funerals and weddings. She's been the secretary of the Wellington Ritz Theatre board of directors since its inception and has left an archive of the most perfectly crafted meeting minutes you will find anywhere in the country. I've suggested she cut back a little, ease up. Quit worrying over things so much. But as my dad used to say, "Katherine ain't got no quit."
   
 And speaking of Dad, we lost him on April 22, just a few short weeks ago. In the last year of his life, his mind and body were failing him. The cowboy who once got up before dawn without an alarm increasingly had to be awakened and reminded to put on his boots. We talked about care options outside the home, but mom wasn't going to have it. She dug in and took on the dual roles of nurse and drill sergeant, handing out the pills, keeping the doctor appointments and making sure he showed up to church in starched Wranglers and pearl snap shirts that he could put on by himself. She "encouraged" him to get up out of the chair and see people, even hauling him to movies down at the Ritz. She provided him a sense of normalcy that he would not have experienced had he been moved away from the house. If I ever suggested she might need help with all this, she'd always say "maybe later."
   
 I should've known she wouldn't give in easily. That's not who she is. Some might call it stubbornness, but I call it devotion. I want to be more like her, but I don't quite measure up yet. If nothing else, I can at least shine a little light on her and all the moms like her, thanking them for never giving up on us. Even if we get befuddled in City Grocery and lose our way on the cookie aisle, there's always a mom or mother figure, like my mom, who never quits loving us and who finds us when we're lost.

Let’s capture this new sense of camaraderie, the _we’re all in it together_ mentality, to build a renewed case for more equal distribution of wealth and opportunity in UK. If we can, we will ensure that the burden of our economic recovery does not fall disproportionately on the poor (as it has done over the last decade). We know that the instincts of the traditional Tory right will see them under pressure to embark on market driven, private sector recovery, with spending restraint at its core. Austerity with knobs on. We must show, to coin Keir Starmer’s slogan, that “Another future really is possible”.

NORTHEAST KINGDOM — Local community, business and organization leaders had an opportunity to outline concerns and hear about possible federal initiatives during a virtual meeting between the Northeast Kingdom Collaborative and Congressman Peter Welch Friday morning.
 Enormity of Economic Concerns
 Northern Counties Investment Corporation (NCIC) President Jon Freeman told Welch he is very concerned about restaurants, dairy, hospitality and tourism.
 “All sectors are seeing a depletion of cash and the employers are really in a terrible condition,” reported Freeman. “We have record numbers of unemployment; as we open the economy back up, these employers are not in a good fiscal position to re-employ. We are quite challenged.”
 The federal Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) was designed for eight weeks, and Freeman said NCIC has been closed for seven weeks, “And there’s no indication of being able to go back to work soon … many of the businesses that were helped by the eight weeks are reaching the end of that period.”
 “These are hard times,” Welch said. “The scale of the problem is enormous.”
 Significant federal dollars for unemployment are flowing to Vermonters through the federal aid packages that have been approved. Welch said the help is major, but “hit or miss” in some places and he vowed to continue to bring more relief to needed sectors in the state.
 “Where we’re having some challenges is with the Paycheck Protection Program” said Welch, saying it’s not working for all businesses.
 About 10,000 businesses in Vermont have been approved for it, he said, “but a lot of businesses like restaurants in particular, where the terms of that PPP loan or grant are restricted … it’s essentially useless for the restaurant industry and the ag industry, but especially the restaurant industry.”
 Except for takeout, restaurants have been shut down during the pandemic restrictions.
 Welch said he’s worried about the restaurant industry, “We need them.”
 Testing Critical
 Welch said he is alarmed that testing standards and protocols for contact tracing and isolation have not been led by the administration.
 “We can’t have our governors competing against each other about who is going to come up with the right test,” Welch said.
 He said widespread, quick testing is critical and countries which have done so, such as South Korea, Taiwan and Germany, have demonstrated this is effective using standard procedures during an epidemic.
 Some countries, through these measures, have not had to close down their economies because they were able to contain spread of the virus, said Welch.
 Welch said he’s a co-sponsor of legislation that would require the president do it. “It’s the job of the administration to execute. That’s a critical component,” said Welch, “People have to have confidence it’s safe to go out for the economy to open back up.”
 State, Municipal, and Nonprofits Need Support
 Substantial aid for states is needed and on the agenda in DC next week, said Welch, noting that without help, a serious, negative trickle down will occur.
 Chad Whitehead, St. Johnsbury’s town manager, said a tax delinquency of 20 percent is expected and for St. Johnsbury that means about $1.25 million.
 He said the municipality is “trying to figure out how we’re going to make it through,” and will look to use some reserves.
 “I don’t think our community wants to hear about cutting essential services right now,” said Whitehead.
 “It’s a grave error for the federal government not to help out with the states and the municipalities,” said Welch. “This is a unique situation, once in 100 years. What I’ve observed in our municipalities, and especially in the Kingdom, you guys are pretty cheap. It’s not like you’re wasting money.”
 Help is also needed for education in Vermont and for non-profits.
 Northern Vermont University President Elaine Collins said, “With COVID we lost our students and we lost our capacity to house them.”
 The coronavirus crisis turned an already fragile fiscal picture into “a crisis,” said Collins.
 “There are other people in line and a lot of needs in the state, and I’m very concerned for our students and our communities,” said Collins.
 Jody Fried, executive director of Catamount Arts, also chairs the NEK Collaborative board, and told the Congressman the creative sector is “facing what I call an existential crisis right now … we have not figured out the path forward.”
 Online and streaming activities are being offered, “But there is very little opportunity for monetization and revenue … It’s really the perfect storm for the creative sector,” said Fried.
 “Especially in rural areas, the creative sector is at the heart and soul of the communities,” said Fried of the sector’s importance to economic and workforce development in the NEK.
 Welch said, “I know you’re right, and Catamount has been such a mainstay in the Kingdom.”
 NVRH, Rural Hospitals, Receive Help
 Welch said rural hospitals received significant infusions of federal help in recent days, which was critically needed.
 Northeastern Vermont Regional Hospital (NVRH) CEO Shawn Tester was on the line, and said, “We were pleasantly surprised with the second round” of federal funding.
 “I was assured it would happen, but in my line of work, I don’t believe it until I see it,” said Welch.
 Without the funds, NVRH was looking at across the board paycuts for anyone earning more than $20 an hour very soon, plus furloughs of dozens of employees, Tester said.
 A deficit is still expected, but one the hospital can handle, said Tester, thanks to the federal aid.
 NEK Broadband
 Also on the Zoom line was Evan Carlson, speaking for a new grassroots NEK Broadband nonprofit, which was approved to form in more than two dozen towns by votes on Annual Town Meeting Day.
 Carlson said a proposal to quickly improve internet access for NEK student needs during the pandemic is proposed, and would cost about $300,000.
 “Obviously when we’re talking about internet funding, that’s a drop in the bucket,” said Carlson.
 He said the proposal is for an emergency, short-term solution that can “have a huge impact for students” during the remote learning environment everyone is presently operating in.
 Carlson said, “We have to have something in place for those students.”
 Welch vowed support for community nonprofit solutions to bring high-speed internet to rural areas.
 Welch said, “We have to future-proof whatever it is we do.”
 NEK Ag and Food
 Also on the Zoom call was Jon Ramsay from the VT Food Venture Center in Hardwick, who said the organization is working with dairy farmers to assist them with available pandemic relief.
 “We’re pivoting and getting as much local food that would have gone to universities and schools to food banks around the Northeast Kingdom,” said Ramsay.
 Welch said he was interested in that due to the markets crashing with schools closed and restaurants closed, and reports of milk dumping and more, “It’s a real challenge.”
 “We know that dairy is a struggle but we want to continue to support dairy as best we can,” said Ramsay.

Today, Brave and other Lakota elders are staring down yet another encroachment on their historic lands: a 10,600-acre uranium mine proposed to be built in the Black Hills. The Dewey-Burdock mine would suck up as much as 8,500 gallons of groundwater per minute from the Inyan Kara aquifer to extract as much as 10 million pounds of ore in total. Lakota say the project violates both the 1868 U.S.-Lakota treaty and federal environmental laws by failing to take into account the sacred nature of the site. If the mine is built, they say, burial grounds would be destroyed and the region’s waters permanently tainted.

The Oglala Sioux’s drawn-out legal challenge to Dewey-Burdock is pushing regulators to acknowledge that federal laws require the tribe’s meaningful consultation in the review of all projects in the Black Hills. The tribe has appealed the NRC board’s ruling, and Parsons, the Oglala Sioux’s lawyer, suspects that if the agency finally involves tribal members in a cultural survey, it’ll find enough sacred sites and burials to make a uranium mine much less likely. “If they do the surveys and still want to mine, then at least we can fight about whether it’s a proper place,” he says. “Right now we’re fighting just to get the data.”

When white frontiersmen blazed through these lands in the 1860s, an Oglala chief named Red Cloud led a war against the United States. The ensuing 1868 Treaty of Fort Laramie created a Great Sioux Reservation that encompassed large swaths of the region, including the Black Hills, as the Lakota’s “permanent home.” Yet the deal was quickly broken. In 1874, “Indian killer” General George Armstrong Custer led an expedition that found gold in the Black Hills. Thousands of white settlers invaded the reservation in violation of the treaty, while also eyeing the hills’ timber and planning a new railroad through Lakota hunting grounds.


--DocBreak--
Brave’s grandfather said the Lakota would one day need to return to the caves in the Black Hills where they rode out the last great flood. That’s “the reason that we really try to treat it as a sacred area,” she says. “We have to go back to it when the time comes.”

The Committee for the Illinois Democracy Amendment is advocating for a constitutional change that would obligate the General Assembly to take roll call votes on bills proposing “stronger ethical standards for Illinois public officials.”
 It would also allow residents to propose related bills by submitting a petition with at least 100,000 signatures.
 The committee’s attorneys argued in a court document that social distancing and stay-at-home restrictions “forced” voters to weigh their health against their First Amendment rights.
 To successfully secure a spot on the ballot, proponents must gather 363,813 hand-written signatures — or, 8 percent of votes cast for the governor in the last election — and deliver the papers to the secretary of state’s office six months before the Nov. 3 general election. That deadline passed May 3.

Fortify was founded in 2012 when it began exploring market-based alternatives to iron-fortified flour, which is mandated by some African governments but is not widely distributed to the rural areas that make up nearly 70% of most African countries. In West Africa, Fortify determined that tomato paste, an important ingredient in most meals, would be the best food vehicle for iron fortification. Tomatoes are rich in Vitamin C, a necessary nutrient to boost iron absorption. In 2015, Fortify presented to one of the largest tomato paste producers the opportunity to positively impact the health of its consumers while building market share. Also that year, Fortify’s Founder and CEO, Nancy Martin, introduced this tomato paste concept to a team of nutrition scientists at the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). Soon afterwards, USAID sponsored a study Identifying Potential New Food Vehicles for Fortification in West Africa, published a report in 2018 that showed high levels of tomato paste consumption.

The Lakota call _Paha Sapa_ “the heart of everything that is.” Tribal origin stories say there was a Great Race between all the two-legged and four-legged creatures to determine who would eat whom. In one telling, the animals raced around the cedar-covered hills, and the magpie narrowly defeated the buffalo, establishing not only the dominance of the two-leggeds, but their responsibility to care for all living beings. Another tale says the Lakota emerged from a cave in the Black Hills following catastrophic floods. Lakota spiritual practices still center on the region.
