Both teams enter the game on two-game losing streaks after being ranked early in the season. Cedar Falls did not play last week after its game with Iowa City High was cancelled. With two games left in the regular season, Tiger running back Ryan Ostrich is just 219 yards short of 1,000 for the season. The Warriors are led by senior quarterback Henry Clymer who has passed for 618 yards and five scores and he has rushed for 161 yards. Running back Jabari Dobbs has carried the ball 98 times for 327 yards and four scores. Washington, which will switch between the spread and I-formation, has scored just six points in its last three games.

Early voting runs from Thursday until Nov. 2. You don’t need to provide a reason for voting early — any registered voter can cast their ballot early in Illinois.
 You have a few early voting options: You can cast your ballot at your local election authority or at designated early polling places, you can send your ballot through the mail or you can drop off your ballot at secured drop box locations in your area.
 Remember you can only vote once in an election. Knowingly voting more than once in Illinois is a class 3 felony.
 If you decide you’d rather vote in person after applying for a mail-in ballot, you’ll need to bring your mail-in ballot to an early voting site or your election precinct polling place and surrender it to an election judge. The election judge should then give you a standard ballot, which you can fill out to vote in person.
 State officials have an online database for all Illinois election boards, which voters can use to check their polling places. Be sure to check dates and hours to make sure the polling place is open on the day you hope to vote.

 # Good Samaritan hailed as hero for evacuating family at Perth Amboy fire scene
 Suzanne Russell
 Bridgewater Courier News
 PERTH AMBOY - A city man has been recognized for his heroic actions in alerting a Smith Street family that their building was on fire Saturday night.
 On Wednesday Isaias Rodriguez was presented with a civilian mayoral and a Perth Amboy Fire Department citation during a fire department hiring and promotion ceremony at fire headquarters on New Brunswick Avenue.
 "On Saturday he was passing by on Smith Street when he saw a building engulfed in smoke, no alarms sounding, nobody outside and he went through the smoke to the second floor to bang on the door to alert the family there was a fire in the basement well involved," Fire Chief Edward Mullen said. "He safely got everybody out."
 On Saturday night a basement fire broke out at 410 Smith St., according to a post on the Perth Amboy Fire Department's Facebook page.
 "A quick thinking Good Samaritan, Isaias Rodriguez, was passing by and saw the building engulfed in smoke, with lights on in the apartment on the second floor. Seeing that no one was outside, he banged on the first floor door to no avail," the post states.
 "He then proceeded up the stairway, through the smoke, to yell and bang on the second floor apartment door. Here he was able to alert the family that their building was on fire as smoke now began to fill the apartment. Isaias was able safely evacuate all the occupants, who were having a small gathering, through the smokey stairwell to safety," the post said.
 "A person who puts their life on the line for someone else is a hero," the post states. "With his actions, the fire department quickly arrived and extinguished the fire, knowing all occupants had been accounted for."

 # Family donates $25 million to Sarasota Memorial Cancer Institute
 Staff report
 The Brian and Sheila Jellison Family Foundation is donating $25 million to Sarasota Memorial Healthcare Foundation – the largest donation in the foundation’s history – to advance the mission of Sarasota Memorial Hospital’s Cancer Institute.
 The donation moves the hospital foundation significantly closer to its $75 million goal for the cancer institute.
 A news release noted that with the Sarasota County Public Hospital Board’s mission to transform cancer care in the community, the new cancer Institute was a perfect fit with the Jellison Family Foundation’s mission, which is focused on helping people facing the challenges of cancer, promoting financial literacy and higher education and supporting local communities of special importance to their family.
 The institute encompasses several new facilities that will give patients greater access to the latest treatments, technologies and clinical trials in their community. Patients and their families will have access to highly specialized oncology physicians, care coordinators and patient navigators to support families through every step in their cancer journey.
 In recognition of the gift, the cancer institute will now be known as the Brian D. Jellison Cancer Institute, including the eight-story oncology tower rising on the hospital’s main campus and slated to open in the fall of 2021. An outpatient radiation oncology center SMH recently opened on its University Parkway campus, and all future buildings and services that are part of the Cancer Institute, also will bear the Jellison name.
 The Jellison Family Foundation was created by Sarasota residents Brian and Sheila Jellison with their three daughters, Christie Jellison Mucha, Hilary Jellison Simonds and Michelle Jellison, in fall 2018. Brian Jellison, the former CEO and chairman of Lakewood Ranch-based Roper Technologies, died of cancer in 2018.
 “Everyone should be able to get the best cancer care without having to leave home … we feel so lucky to be able to help SMH bring that care home to Sarasota,” said Sheila Jellison, who serves as president of the family foundation, alongside her three daughters, who serve as directors.
 “We wanted to do something meaningful and impactful that really spoke to us,” said Hilary Jellison Simonds. “We know first-hand from living through our father’s treatment that dealing with cancer can be a hard, lonely road for patients and caregivers. With this gift, we want to let other families know that they are not alone.”
 Sarasota Memorial CEO David Verinder and Mason Ayres, president of Sarasota Memorial Healthcare Foundation, said the Jellison Family Foundation’s gift memorializes the most important aspect of a cancer patient’s experience – hope.
 “With this donation, they not only honor a beloved husband, father and grandfather, they also give the tremendous gift of hope and courage to people fighting cancer in our community,” Verinder said.
 “We are so grateful to the Jellison family for their vision and generosity,” said Ayres. “This transformational gift means so much to everyone who has faced cancer either personally or with a loved one.”
 The cancer institute is expanding the local team of oncology specialists, while creating a centralized place for coordinated care and ongoing support for patients and their families and caregivers, according to a news release.
 “There are so many wonderful aspects of the Cancer Institute, but one of the most important to us as a family is the hope and support it provides,” said Christie Jellison Mucha. “When someone receives a cancer diagnosis, there is a physical and emotional toll, and it can be overwhelming. Having someone to walk you through all the appointments, questions and concerns is such a gift. It gives the patient and their caregivers a chance to breathe and just focus on getting better.”
 “We really hope this gift inspires others to support the Sarasota Memorial Healthcare Foundation and the Cancer Institute to help make Sarasota an outstanding place to receive cancer care,” said Michelle Jellison.
 Sarasota oncologist Richard Brown, MD, who guided Brian Jellison’s cancer care in Sarasota and serves as medical director of the Jellison Cancer Institute, said the new name reflects Sarasota Memorial’s patient-centered approach.
 “Cancer treatment may involve chemotherapy, radiation or surgery, but cancer care is much more than that,” said Dr. Brown. “It’s the people and programs supporting and guiding patients through the significant challenges of their cancer experience. The gift from the Jellison Family Foundation will help us ensure local patients receive the compassionate, comprehensive care they deserve.”
 Brian Jellison was the Roper Technologies CEO for 17 years during a 50-year career in business., helping Roper transform its business model and increasing its market capitalization from $1.5 billion to over $30 billion. In 2018, Institutional Investor recognized him as the Best CEO in the Electrical Equipment & Multi-Industry sector and Harvard Business Review named him one of the Best Performing CEOs in the World.
 Sarasota Memorial has invested more than $250 million in the developing the cancer institute. For more information, visit smh.com.

 # Motorist dies in single-vehicle crash in Blackwood
 Jim Walsh
 Cherry Hill Courier-Post
 GLOUCESTER TWP. - A motorist died in a single-vehicle crash here Thursday, police say.
 The driver, whose name was not released, was the sole occupant of a vehicle that hit a tree off East Landing Road around 10:55 a.m., said Gloucester Township police.
 Officers said the vehicle sustained "significant front end damage" and the driver "was in and out of consciousness."
 The motorist died after being taken to an area hospital.
 An investigation into the crash closed the road in the Blackwood section for about two hours.
 The crash was the sixth fatal traffic accident in Gloucester Township this year.
 Anyone who saw the accident is asked to call Gloucester Township police at 856-228-4500 or the department's anonymous tip line at 856-842-5560.

Culpepper’s enthusiasm for the meeting had nothing to do with his love for boats, though.
 The neighbor, “Tom,” also goes by “Tom Terrific” and is, in fact, new Tampa Bay Buccaneers signal-caller and future Hall of Fame quarterback Tom Brady. Renting the former mansion owned by New York Yankees Hall of Fame shortstop Derek Jeter, Brady and his wife, Giselle, moved into the home in April.
 Instantly, Culpepper’s months of COVID-19-induced quarantine were given a massive boost of intrigue. And that Culpepper is a Bucs fan, no less, made the new arrangement that much more fun.
 “Yeah. (It’s) pretty crazy,” Culpepper said. “I mean, that's the greatest quarterback of all-time… it's nuts.”
 Truth be told, though, Culpepper intends to make a footnote of the new neighbor when it comes to his 2020.
 A rising redshirt sophomore ahead of the Nittany Lions’ season, Culpepper is hoping to break into the two-deep in the program’s always-competitive defensive tackles group. Having made the most of his time away from the Nittany Lions in March, April, May, and June, dedicating his time to working out with his brother, Syracuse quarterback Rex, the younger Culpepper appears poised to do exactly that.
 Rotating with redshirt freshman Hakeem Beamon at the Nittany Lions’ three- technique defensive tackle position behind presumed starter P.J. Mustipher in the team’s August and September practices, Culpepper said he has already seen the effort pay dividends.
 “I think I had a really productive spring as far as the weight room went. I really made a lot of gains,” Culpepper said. “I felt like come camp and when we really started to get going, it's going to show and I feel like it has already.”
 According to Mustipher, it already has.
 Building on a reputation as one of the team’s hardest workers, Culpepper has quickly put himself into a position to make an impact in his third season in the program.
 Concentrating on improving his strength and speed, plus his get-off on the ball and violent hands, Culpepper now is listed at 6-foot-4, 281 pounds.
 Needing to beat out Beamon for the opportunity to improve on his 92 total defensive reps over nine games last season, the result has been an intense competition that only figures to get more heated as the next few weeks lead into an Oct. 24 start to the Nittany Lions’ season at Indiana.
 “We all know what's at stake, so we're all putting our best effort out there. But we're all friends. We're all trying to make each other better,” Culpepper said. “So I think we all understand that and we're all just working to be the best D-line that we could possibly be.”
 Said by Penn State defensive coordinator Brent Pry to be “ready to play” this season thanks to his work ethic and physicality, the stage is set for Culpepper to make just such a move in the weeks and months to come.
 “Judge comes into work every day and he puts his head down and he just works. He's not doing anything else. He's not interested in anything else but just getting better on the football field,” Mustipher said. “Judge is continuing to progress. I'm expecting big things for him. I know he's expecting even bigger things for himself.
 “Judge has been putting his head down for these past couple years. I expect Judge to have a big year for us and we need him to inside. Judge is a workhorse.”

BRUSSELS - European Union leaders sought Thursday to end an embarrassing standoff that prevents them from imposing sanctions on senior officials in Belarus who stand accused of falsifying presidential election results and leading a crackdown on peaceful protesters.
 The roadblock borders on the absurd. All EU member countries reject the result of the Aug. 9 election that allowed Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko to extend his 26 years in office. EU members want a new election and agree that sanctions should be slapped on dozens of officials, perhaps even the leader once dubbed Europe’s last dictator.
 But Cyprus, one of the EU’s smallest member countries, is vetoing the move. It is demanding that its partners in the world’s biggest trading bloc also take action against Turkey for its energy exploration work in disputed waters off the island nation’s coast.
 After European foreign ministers failed to break the deadlock last month, the EU's foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, warned that “our credibility is at stake,” if the bloc cannot forge a common foreign policy among 27 countries.
 “It is bad that we cannot make it work,” Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said Thursday.
 “It is of major importance we agree on Belarus sanctions. There is wide- ranging agreement on that. A link between Belarus and Turkey is political only, and has no explanation when we assess the facts,” Rutte said. “What we need to achieve in the coming hours is a decoupling, while we have to recognize there are legitimate concerns about Turkey.”
 Ahead of the two-day summit, diplomats said an accommodation might be found. The leaders were holding wide-ranging talks about the EU’s troubled ties with Turkey over its drilling in the Mediterranean Sea, its roles in the conflicts in Libya and Syria, and as a source of migrants trying to reach Europe.
 Cyprus could be appeased if its partners underline their support in the final summit communique, or in a special statement from European Council President Charles Michel, who is chairing the two-day meeting. The leaders could then give a green light to sanctions against dozens of Belarus officials.
 That would allow national envoys to quickly enact the sanctions in coming days, the EU diplomats said.
 French President Emmanuel Macron was staunch in his support, saying that “solidarity is non-negotiable” when it comes to Cyprus, but also to Greece in its long-running dispute with Turkey.
 “When a European Union member state is attacked, threatened, when its territorial waters are not respected, it’s the duty of Europeans to show their solidarity,” Macron said.

“Possessor” – a horror thriller that unfolds like a slow burn across an oil field – is a more confident, beguiling and brutal picture than Cronenberg’s confident, beguiling, brutal 2012 debut, though also more of a head-scratcher (admirers of gore and aesthetically hypnotic cinema will enjoy the itch the most, even as it starts to splice your head open). In “Antiviral,” Cronenberg’s first movie, celebrity mania has become so overcharged that people are willing to have themselves injected with diseases that have afflicted those in the tabloids. In “Possessor,” things are more covert, with Cronenberg’s screenplay placing a sharper focus on character than the dystopian world-building of his last effort.

The London court heard from an array of witnesses, who pronounced on issues of huge importance and substance, such as the freedom of the press and government-sanctioned torture.
 “Julian Assange’s actions, which have been characterized as criminal, are actions that expose power to sunlight," renowned U.S. linguist and scholar Noam Chomsky said.
 Other witnesses relayed more shadowy — and sometimes comic — matters of intrigue during his time at WikiLeaks and at the Ecuadorian Embassy,
 According to one witness, Assange “binge-watched” the suicide of the former Bosnian Croat general, Slobodan Praljak, at a U.N. court three years ago.
 Defence lawyers said Assange was suffering from wide-ranging mental health issues, including suicidal tendencies, that could be exacerbated if he is placed in inhospitable prison conditions in the U.S. They said Assange’s mental health deteriorated while he took asylum inside the embassy and that he was diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder.
 His legal team argued that Assange would very likely face solitary confinement in the U.S. immediately that would put him at a heightened risk of suicide. They also said that if convicted, Assange would most likely be sent to the notorious ADX Supermax prison in Colorado, a facility labeled by a former warden as a “fate worse than death” and inhabited by the likes of Unabomber Ted Kaczynski and Mexican drug lord Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman.
 Lawyers acting on behalf of the U.S. government argued that Assange’s mental state was not as poor as described and said he wouldn’t be subject to improper conditions before or after any trial.
 Assange has attracted the support of high-profile figures, including actress Pamela Anderson and rapper M.I.A. The dissident Chinese contemporary artist Ai Weiwei also staged a silent protest outside the court.
 Daniel Ellsberg, perhaps the most famous whistleblower in living memory, argued that they had “very comparable political opinions.”
 The 89-year-old, widely credited for helping to bring about an end to the Vietnam War through his leaking of the so-called Pentagon Papers in 1971, said the American public “needed urgently to know what was being done routinely in their name, and there was no other way for them to learn it than by unauthorized disclosure.”
 There are clear echoes between Assange and Ellsberg, who leaked over 7,000 pages of classified documents to the press, including The New York Times and The Washington Post. He was subsequently put on trial on 12 charges in connection with violations of the Espionage Act, which were punishable by up to 115 years in prison. The charges were dismissed in 1973 because of government misconduct against him.
 Assange will be hoping that developments within the U.S. government over the coming weeks will lead to a similar outcome for him — before any judgment from the London court.

"We don't have much time, and we haven't had spring and the summer to develop the way that we wanted to,” said Clifford, who’s entering his second season as the starting quarterback for the Nittany Lions. “Obviously, I have trust and I've seen it on the field how hard everybody's been working away from the facility, but you know, football is a team game and you need to get everybody together and the chemistry needs to be there.
 “So, we just need to keep grinding out these details day in, day out. Everyday, we talk about that 1-0 mentality, [and] that really takes precedent right now because we only have three or four weeks until this first game. …The details are critical."
 One thing that hasn’t been impacted much by the pandemic is Clifford’s relationship with Ciarrocca. Throughout the spring, Zoom, FaceTime and other methods kept them in constant communication, and now that they’ve both been inside the Lasch Building for months, that bond has become even stronger.
 “I think we connected right from the beginning,” Clifford said. “I think that he's a very easy person to talk to, especially when you're in the football facilities. We get along really well, solely just because, I mean, we both love the game. So, it's really easy to talk to him. I think that, you know, both of us are extremely hard workers, and so the minute that we had the chance to finally get going, I think that also just helped our relationship.
 “But it keeps growing every day, on and off the field. I'm getting to know him in so many ways, and I think that he's just an outstanding coach so far. He's really changed my thought process on some things and made the game a lot easier for me. I'm excited to to put that product on the field coming up soon."

If you plan to vote by mail, you have to apply. Election authorities must receive the application for a mail-in ballot by Oct. 29.
 The Postal Service recommended that Illinois voters wanting to cast a ballot by mail submit their applications “at least 15 days before Election Day at a minimum, and preferably long before that time.”
 Election authorities will start sending mail-in ballots to approved applicants on Thursday. Once you’ve filled out the ballot, you can return it through the Postal Service or licensed couriers, or bring it to the election board that has jurisdiction over your area.
 The ballot must be received within 14 days after Election Day. They also must be postmarked by Election Day, meaning any ballot sent through the mail after Nov. 3 will not be counted.
 Before casting your ballot by mail, make sure you sign your return envelope and ballot wherever indicated.
 Election boards provide various ways for voters to track their ballot.

In a televised address marking the 60th anniversary of Cyprus’ independence, Cypriot President Nicos Anastasiades expressed Thursday his “sincere gratitude to all European Union member states for their staunch support and solidarity in light of Turkey’s provocations.”
 But Anastasiades said he wants the leaders to take “a more tangible and effective stance to bring about an end to gunboat diplomacy and for the crisis to be succeeded by dialogue or recourse to the international court on the basis of international law and the law of the sea.”
 Making the same point, Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said, “The time has come for Europe to discuss with courage and honesty what kind of relationship it truly wants to have with Turkey. One thing is certain: Turkish provocation, whether this is expressed through unilateral actions or extreme rhetoric, can no longer be tolerated.
 In Ankara, meanwhile, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan described his country’s operations in the eastern Mediterranean its most important “naval struggle of the past few centuries.”
 During a speech in parliament, Erdogan said the EU had turned into an “ineffective, horizonless and shallow” structure and become a “slave to the conceit” of Greece and Cyprus. However, he also said that Turkey is committed to resolving disputes through dialogue.
 In a draft of the final summit statement, seen by The Associated Press, the leaders say the EU “fully supports the democratic right of the Belarusian people to elect their President through new free and fair elections, without external interference.”
 They call “on the Belarusian authorities to end violence and repression, release all detainees and political prisoners, respect media freedom and civil society, and start an inclusive national dialogue.” In the document, they agree “that restrictive measures should be imposed” on Belarus officials.
 The dispute shines a spotlight on troubling old questions about the EU’s ability to act quickly and with one voice. The leaders will also discuss ties with China, but here, too, they are divided on how to approach a country that is a major trading partner yet poses serious economic and political challenges.
