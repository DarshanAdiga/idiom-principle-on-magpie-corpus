Like many Americans, the Ghanaian community in the U.S. is not exempt from the COVID-19 crisis. We feel the overwhelming stress and the risk of transferring the contagion to their loved ones, all while trying to make ends meet. The Act provides financial relief in critical areas that would strengthen public hospitals and the public health care system by assisting health care employers with developing and implementing infectious disease exposure control plans. Ghanaians are essential workers and are very active in the health care industry, especially as nurses, personal care aides, and nursing assistants. Ghanaians are included in 27.5% of all Black immigrant workers in the U.S. - more than 750,000 - who work in the healthcare sector.

Aaron’s has been gaining from improved performance in the Progressive segment, driven by strong invoice growth, efficient operating cost management and sturdy customer payment activities. Encouragingly, management envisions revenues in the Progressive segment to be $575-$585 million along with adjusted EBITDA of $100-$105 million for the third quarter. Moreover, invoice growth is likely to have risen on a sequential basis to the tune of low to mid-single digits in the third quarter.      Further, management noted in its last earnings call that the third quarter started off on a positive note on the back of solid performances across all products and categories as well as a strong customer base and a robust lease portfolio. Consequently, the company predicted third-quarter revenues of $1-$1.02 billion, with adjusted earnings of $1.4-$.15 per share. Also, comps are likely to have been positive in the to-be-reported quarter.      Additionally, the company has been making efforts to revamp the Aaron’s business segment, which is likely to have reflected in the third-quarter revenues and earnings. Its transformational initiatives, including investments in activities to improve customer experience, operating efficiencies, compliance and employee engagement, bode well. Apart from these, strength in Aaron’s e-commerce business has been aiding performance. In fact, the company expected revenues for the Aaron's Business segment of $415-$425 million, with same-store revenue growth of 4-6% and adjusted EBITDA of $43-$48 million.      Overall, management predicted third-quarter revenues of $950-$975 million and adjusted earnings of 80-90 cents per share, on its last reported quarter’s earnings call.      However, effects of uncertainties related to the COVID-19 situation will continue to partly mar results in the third quarter. Although stores have resumed operations, sluggish store traffic islikely to have acted as a headwind in the third quarter.

Meanwhile, there is still ardent opposition to Borat in the country. The Kazakhstan American Association wrote a letter addressed to Amazon executives dated October 20, requesting the "racist" sequel to be pulled from its streaming service, Prime Video.
 "Considering today's socially aware political climate, why is a racist film which openly berates, bullies and traumatizes a nation comprised of people of color an acceptable form of entertainment that meets Amazon's ethical values?" the letter states. "Why is our small nation fair game for public ridicule?"
 "In this film, a white person adorns a Kazakh persona and then culturally appropriates and belittles everything we stand for. We, Kazakhs, are a small nation, but it does not mean that we are allowed to be targets for racism," it continued.
 CBS News reached out to Amazon for further comment, but did not immediately hear back.

 Limited editions feature aluminum derived from a real wartime Supermarine Spitfire, cloth from the wings of the original Wright Flyer, and the very rare MB1, which you can only buy if you have successfully ejected from a fighter plane in a Martin Baker ejector seat. Somewhat niche as a market. But it's not all up in the air or limited edition.
