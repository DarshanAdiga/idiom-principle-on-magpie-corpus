The person could have contracted the virus after the flight and then test positive. Because it's often unclear exactly when and where transmission occurs, health officials notify the public of a potential exposure on board the flight as a precaution.
 Air Canada also said flights that result in potential exposure notifications being issued represent less than one per cent of all the flights the airline operates.

The whimsical melodies, oompah beat and references to plodding about in the snow mask a spiky undertone to the song, which Lewie would later admit was meant as a protest about war.

Mr Hinchliffe has been recalled from holidays to deal with a growing tourism crisis in the wake of border closures because of a coronavirus outbreak in NSW.Mr Hinchliffe said any Sydneysiders who were unable to make it to Queensland should immediately cancel to allow locals to snap up bargains, a comment that has rankled LNP leader Mr Crisafulli.Queensland closed its borders on Tuesday and is denying entry to anyone who has visited or resides in greater Sydney or the city’s northern beaches.The hard border closure will continue until at least January 8. “I ask those from interstate to keep the faith,” Mr Crisafulli said.“The stupidity we heard today is not reflective of what the industry is saying.“You can ask anyone in the industry; no one is telling anyone from Sydney to cancel their bookings.“That shows a guy who just doesn’t get it and if he’s not going to defend Queensland tourism, I am.”Mr Hinchliffe suggested many accommodations booked by people from greater Sydney were in destinations “now hard to find” and tour operators should be flexible with refunds when possible.“We’re expecting strong interest from interstate and Queensland holiday-makers in snapping up cancelled bookings from greater Sydney,” Mr Hinchliffe said on Tuesday.Mr Crisafulli said the Palaszczuk government needed to keep referring to that date when discussing border closures and not send mixed messages about potentially keeping the border closed beyond January 8. “I ask the state government … certainly not to tell people to cancel their holidays,” he said.“You’ve got a date that the Health Minister said they will review things; don’t send mixed messages beyond that date.“That still gives us almost all of January, all of February (for people to travel).”He said in light of no international tourism and restrictions on interstate travel, Queenslanders should consider holidaying at home or up in the north or west of the state.“My message is that if you have the capacity holiday in Queensland and that may mean staying in the city you live,” he said.Mr Hinchliffe had his holiday leave cut short on Wednesday, two days after he checked out for Christmas.A spokesman told The Courier-Mail that Mr Hinchliffe’s trip was to “host meetings with tourism industry stakeholders and Queensland Health”. Cairns Tourism Industry Association president Kevin Byrne called Mr Hinchliffe’s holiday “disrespectful” to struggling tourism operators.“For him to go on leave at this crucial time sends a dreadful message to the tourism industry,” he said.“These guys have been (to) hell and back in the past nine months. And particularly the damage that’s been caused by the on-again, off-again border closures.”

Their 'Light the North' trail - a tremendous initiative - aims to place 50 lighthouses at specific locations across the North East and Northern Isles. Designed by artists, both local and from further afield, the 2.5m tall sculptures will be a beacon of hope and positivity. Not only will the Light the North trail support vital cancer support services across the region, it also gives a platform for hugely talented artists at a time when they have faced real difficulties. We were thrilled to come on board as a sponsor and I cannot wait until the trail opens to the public in March. While it was unfortunately delayed, it will be well worth the wait.

The Planned Development requested by Triarc would cover the 26.15 acres the company wants to build on, if ultimately approved. The specialty zone allows the city to have stricter requirements than a standard apartment complex including requiring open space and amenities.
 No townhomes would be included if Triarc builds in 10 acres rather than all the land they intend to purchase, the work would all be done at once and the complex would change in design and offerings.
 “The original plan is a dual plan 200 (in Phase 1)/200. The alternative is 200 to 240 (units),” developer Joseph Bramante told council.
 Triarc has provided rent estimates at $900 to $1,200 and up for units in the planned development. It has not released what sort of units would be built if it instead proceeds with Plan B.
 The company wants to build the Creekside Apartments it envisioned with walking trails, open spaces, pools, crawfish boiling areas, a dog park, green space and more.
 “By solving El Campo’s housing need, we ensure its future remains prosperous,” Bramante said.
 The company recently conducted an interest survey drawing 755 who said they wanted to rent in the planned development. “Of those, 238 qualified,” Bramante said, adding roughly a third of those were seeking three-bedroom units.
 Council allowed multiple public speakers Monday although the agenda item before it was solely to debate and act upon P&Z’s decision.
 Speakers split for and against the units, some sending their comments in as allowed under COVID-19 restrictions. Those comments were each read by Mayor Chris Barbee.
 Former Mayor Richard Young, in a written comment, told council the city’s “number one shortfall is quality housing.” He called on council to carefully consider the project. “It’s easier to be swayed by a local few and not the needs of the entire community,” he said.

"I'm incredibly excited and humbled for the opportunity to be at a place like Auburn University," Harsin said. "I knew it would take a special opportunity to get me out of Boise and Auburn is exactly that, the chance to compete at the highest level for one of the greatest programs in college football.
 "I have a tremendous amount of respect for the coaches and players in the Southeastern Conference, but am ready to help build a foundation at Auburn where we can consistently compete for championships. I want our program to make Auburn proud both on and off the field with consistent excellence. I'm very grateful to Allen Greene and Dr. Gogue for this opportunity. Kes, our kids and I can't wait to meet the Auburn family and get to work!"
 In his debut season Harsin led his alma mater back to where it rose to national prominence. Boise State went 12-2 in 2014, winning its first outright Mountain West Championship and capping the campaign with a 38-30 victory over Arizona in the 2014 VIZIO Fiesta Bowl.
 The victory in the Fiesta Bowl was the third such win for the Broncos in the previous nine seasons. Harsin, serving as offensive coordinator in the first two Fiesta Bowl victories, has been a part of each of the school’s three appearances in the game.
 The team’s victory in the 2014 Mountain West Football Championship marked Boise State’s first outright league title since joining the conference in 2011, and the first overall since 2009. The only alumnus to lead the Broncos as head coach in the history of Boise State, Harsin has won conference championships as a student-athlete, assistant coach and head coach.
 Boise State also captured MW titles in 2017 and 2019, giving Harsin three in six seasons. In 2017, the Broncos capped the championship campaign with a 38-28 victory over Oregon in the Las Vegas Bowl. The Broncos concluded the year at 11-3 overall and ranked No. 22 in both the Associated Press and Coaches Polls.
 "We are thrilled to welcome Coach Harsin to the Auburn family. He's a proven winner whose record speaks for itself," Auburn Athletics Director Allen Green said of the hire. "Coach Harsin impressed me with his detailed plan to lead Auburn to consistently compete for championships in the Southeastern Conference. I'm grateful to Gen. Burgess, Quentin Riggins and each member of our advisory committee for their commitment to Auburn during this process. We look forward to welcoming Bryan, Kes and their children to the Plains to introduce them to the Auburn family."
 The Broncos went 12-2 in 2019, recording the team’s first perfect 8-0 conference record since joining the MW and earning the school’s fifth all-time appearance in the Las Vegas Bowl. Boise State concluded the season ranked in both the AP (No. 23) and Coaches Polls (No. 22) and were No. 19 in the final rankings of the College Football Playoff Poll, the third-straight season finishing in the top 25 of the CFP.
 In 2015, the Broncos went 9-4, climbing as high as No. 20 in both the AP and Coaches Polls. Boise State capped the 2015 campaign with a 55-7 victory over Northern Illinois in the San Diego County Credit Union Poinsettia Bowl, the fifth-largest margin of victory in the history of bowl games. In 2016, Harsin guided the Broncos to a 10-3 record and an appearance in the Motel 6 Cactus Bowl.
 In 2018, the Broncos concluded the season ranked in all three major polls - No. 23 in the AP Poll, No. 24 in the Coaches Poll and No. 25 in the CFP Rankings. The Broncos have been ranked in the top 25 in each of Harsin’s six seasons, climbing as high as No. 13 in both the AP and Coaches Polls in 2016, and No. 13 in the Coaches Poll in 2019, Boise State’s highest rankings since finishing eighth and sixth in each, respectively, in 2011.
 Boise State went 10-3 in 2018, boasting the Mountain West Offensive Player of the Year in quarterback Brett Rypien – one of 11 All-Mountain West honorees. Rypien concluded his career as the Mountain West’s all-time leader in career 300-yard passing games (21), completions (1,036) and passing yards (13,581). He also ranked second in league history in both wins by a starting quarterback (37) and career attempts (1,619), and tied for second in career touchdown passes (90).

Those who only want to do good. Sadly, such isn't the preferred. They are the Eugene Wasetso variety. They are flushed out to create room for perfect, dyed in the wool sycophants. The judgements continually flowing from the courts speak to the ethical and professional decay of two, once glorious institutions flourishing in their mandates; the Directorate of Public Prosecutions (DPP) division and the DCEC. I won't stop talking about that. They hate me for it, but I really can't be bothered. We need the DPP and the DCEC back from the policies and their deployees. We need them back serving the public according to their statutes. The rogues at the DPP and DCEC must not hold the nation at ransom. They must join politics and take their places in the party choirs where they belong. The recent judgements coming out of the courts call us, as a nation, to demand the DPP and DCEC institutions back, as a matter of urgency. The present crop of sycophants that have led to the present situation, of malicious investigations and prosecutions, must all be given offices at the department of sanitation and waste management if they can't join the party choirs. The department would be best suited for their variety.

The very people who ran for office on a tactic of accusing their opponents of wanting to “defund the police” are literally defunding the police and other essential services by forcing states and municipalities to slash their budgets to account for lost revenue.
 They know they won’t be held accountable. The blame will be placed on those who make the hard choices Senate Republicans avoided.
 And, why in the world was protecting the rights of workers to seek redress for dangerous working conditions ever a viable bargaining chip? Shouldn’t Republicans be as interested as Democrats in keeping people safe? Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s position here was unconscionable.
 Much of the rest of the deal fits the same mold — good steps, but not enough.
 The allocation of $20 billion to purchase COVID-19 vaccines and $8 billion to distribute them was a no-brainer. We’ll see if it gets the job done.
 Extending the Paycheck Protection Program was the right thing to do. We hope to see it administered better than it was earlier in the year.
 Rental assistance and nutrition assistance are included in the bill, and are much needed. People are hungry. Many may find themselves homeless when eviction moratoriums expire, and landlords can’t afford to carry the burden of non-paying tenants forever.
 The bottom line of the weakened deal is that it will buy time. It will hold off the very worst effects of COVID-19’s damage to the economy and the people who power it, but more is going to be needed, and sooner than many think.
 It’s better than nothing.

There have been at least 1,300 flights that have either landed or taken off in Canada since the start of September with potential COVID-19 exposures on board, according to information provided by the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC).
 This includes at least 200 flights during the past two weeks, including five flights from the U.K., where a new strain of the novel coronavirus is spreading rapidly.
 It’s not clear how many people may have been exposed to the virus on board these flights, and whether all of the passengers were travelling for essential reasons, but public health experts are warning that the urge to be physically close to the people we care about most this holiday season could end up causing more harm than good.

Curtis Weaver made it three-straight MW Player of the Year honors for the Broncos in 2019, following Rypien’s nod in 2018 and Leighton Vander Esch’s Defensive Player of the Year award in 2017. Weaver established the MW career sacks record (34.0) in just three seasons before declaring early for the National Football League Draft, where he extended the Broncos’ streak of consecutive years with an early entrant being selected. Boise State now has seven-consecutive such seasons, one of only nine schools in the country to boast such a distinction. The list also includes Alabama, Clemson, Florida, Florida State, LSU, Penn State, Stanford and Washington.
 Defensive end DeMarcus Lawrence (2014) started the streak, followed by running back Jay Ajayi (2015), linebacker Kamalei Correa (2016), running back Jeremy McNichols (2017), linebacker Leighton Vander Esch (2018), running back Alexander Mattison (2019) and Weaver.
 Vander Esch was a first-round selection of the Dallas Cowboys after foregoing his final season of eligibility. In his rookie season, Vander Esch was named second-team All-Pro by the Associated Press.
 The Broncos have won at least 10 games in five of Harsin’s six seasons, giving Boise State 17 since joining what is now known as the Football Bowl Subdivision in 1996. The total ranks second behind only Ohio State during that time.
 The Broncos’ six-consecutive bowl appearances under Harsin runs the school’s streak to 18, tied for the nation’s fifth-longest.
 For his efforts in 2014, Harsin was named a finalist for the Paul “Bear Bryant” National Coach of the Year Award, the Eddie Robinson National Coach of the Year Award and the Dodd Trophy, given annually by the Bobby Dodd National Coach of the Year Foundation. He was also named the nation’s top first-year head coach by the Football Writers Association of America.
 Harsin was named head coach, Dec. 11, 2013. A graduate of Capital High School in Boise, he played quarterback for the Broncos from 1995-99. Following his graduation from Boise State with a degree in business management, Harsin coached running backs and receivers at Eastern Oregon in 2000.
 The former Bronco letterwinner began his coaching career at Boise State as a graduate assistant in 2001, before taking over the tight ends as a full-time assistant coach from 2002-05. When Chris Petersen was hired as head coach in 2006, Harsin assumed the role of offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach.
 Harsin was Petersen’s offensive coordinator for five of his eight seasons as head coach (2006-10) and was named a finalist for the 2009 Broyles Award, awarded annually to the nation’s top assistant coach. Boise State went 61-5 during his tenure as offensive coordinator.
 With Harsin on staff, Boise State has won 11 conference championships.
 Following the 2010 season, Harsin went to Texas, where he served as co- offensive coordinator from 2011-12. While with the Longhorns, Harsin helped guide the ascension of an offense that ranked 88th in scoring prior to his arrival, to No. 24 nationally in 2012 (36.1).
 Harsin then earned his first head coaching opportunity at Arkansas State in 2013, which claimed a share of the Sun Belt Conference championship and a berth in the GoDaddy.com Bowl that season.
 Harsin and his wife Kes have two daughters, Devyn Lynn and Dayn Mykena, and a son, Davis.

“Cyberpunk 2077” was supposed to be the biggest game of the year. Two weeks after launch, it’s the biggest failure of the year — and perhaps, the entire generation.
 The comedy of errors that is CD Projekt Red’s once-magnum opus continued to feed on itself this past week as Sony and Microsoft began offering refunds without questions for all digital purchases, with the former even going as far to completely pull the game from the PlayStation Network Store. Microsoft, which secured the marketing rights to what should have been the surefire most successful game of the year, added a disclaimer to its store listing, warning users of potential problems with the title.
 The fun didn’t stop there. No, the snowball that is the troubles surrounding ‘Cyberpunk 2077” continued to grow throughout the week into the weekend. Reports surfaced of extremely disgruntled developers who are furious with the management team that mandated the Dec. 10 ship date, even knowing about the poor performance of the game on the base Xbox One and PlayStation 4. Management openly lied about the condition of those versions of the title as little as two weeks before launch, when CD Projekt joint-CEO Adam Kaciński told journalists on Nov. 27 that the console versions ran “surprisingly good.” Perhaps, that quote would make sense if he didn’t even think the game would boot on those consoles.
 Now Kaciński and other management team members are facing the potential of two lawsuits from investors. Lawyers in Warsaw, Poland, where CD Projekt is based, are weighing options to file a lawsuit that accuses the developer of, “misrepresentation in order to receive financial benefits.” Essentially, they maintain Kaciński and others knew how poorly the game was running on the legacy consoles and purposefully hid that information by only showing carefully curated PC footage for all promotional materials. Many media outlets have even reported any console footage or impressions were embargoed until after the release date.
 As mentioned last week, “Cyberpunk 2077” is in a near-unplayable state on the legacy consoles. It works somewhat well on the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X by pure brute force with the extra console power. While the Xbox Series X version seems to be somewhat stable, albeit still subpar compared to similar games, the PS5 version can reportedly crash at random.
 The developer acknowledged these issues within a few days of launch, releasing a statement that directed anyone who wanted to get a refund for the game to contact Sony or Microsoft, or whichever retailer they purchased it from. The message made it seem like CD Projekt Red had reached an agreement with the two console manufacturers to issue refunds. Both Sony and Microsoft are notorious for not allowing refunds, except in the most extreme of circumstances. So when many reached out to both — especially to Sony — they found their requests initially rejected. It wasn’t until several days of outrage that Sony issued a statement saying that it would issue a refund for anyone who purchased the game, and was immediately pulling it from the PSN Store. If that doesn’t seem drastic, look up a game called “Life of Black Tiger” to see just what Sony is willing to allow on its storefront.
 This backlash was felt by the development team, which held a very contentious meeting with management. Among the more fitting questions asked by the developers was how could management create a culture of crunch by forcing developers to work 60-100 hour weeks while developing a cyberpunk-based game that called out corporate corruption and power abuse. The irony was lost upon management, but not by developers. Management had been on record throughout the year saying “Cyberpunk 2077” did not have a mandated release window, and that it would release when it was ready. It was not ready Dec. 10.
 This entire mess of a situation saw the price of CD Projekt’s stock drop by 40 percent from a 52-week high earlier in the month. Investors were riding high on the anticipated success of ‘Cyberpunk 2077,” only to see the end result not live up to any expectation. Never mess with a shareholder’s money. That has prompted investors in both Poland and the United States to contemplate lawsuits, according to the “New York Times.” None have been filed yet, but it could be only a matter of time.
 For their part, developers seem to be trying to salvage “Cyberpunk 2077.” Despite yet another major bug surfacing this weekend, prompting the game to simply stop reading a save file if it gets too big, the team has already issued one major patch, and is readying another soon. The PC version isn’t without issues, but is starting to be cleaned up a bit better. It’s just a shame that developers who spent the last eight months working long hours of crunch with the expectation of a respite at the end of the year are now back to work trying to salvage a product that should not have seen the light of day until next year. They are the ones who will suffer the most, and they’re the ones who should suffer the lease — the living embodiment of the very themes that their game is trying to criticize.

The car being developed by the tech giant is internally known as the Titan and of course, it will be an electric vehicle. Plans for Apple’s own electric car have been in the pipeline since 2014. Since then however, these plans changed from EV to a focus on autonomous tech.
 Two people close to the matter confirmed however that the new car will sport some breakthrough tech including a new battery design. For now electric vehicles are powered mostly by lithium-ion batteries. However, the company is playing with the idea of lithium-iron phosphate batteries. This chemistry allows for a lower risk of overheating unlike lithium-ion which, if not designed or packaged properly run the risk of combustion.
 The other reason for the big news about their batteries is that the company is looking at a monocell design, something that crams in more individual cells into the battery packs. This also eliminates pouches and modules and this essentially means bigger batteries which in turn means longer range.

BURLINGTON JUNCTION, Mo. – Tuesday night may have been the start of a new rivalry in northwest Missouri as the West Nodaway Rockets defeated St. Joseph Christian 78-58. The Rockets avenged a 29-point loss to the Lions a season ago with a 48-points second half.
 “They beat us by 29 last year and that was a point in the season when we had to make the decision on where we go from here, and our decision was to get better from that moment,” West Nodaway coach Brandon Phipps said. “We started playing really good basketball, got better this offseason and came to a point where we beat them by 20.”
 The blowout win was a slow burn as the two teams began the game trading blows on each possession. The Lions and Rockets traded the lead four times over the first two minutes of the game while combining for 14 points.

A Boaz man is behind bars on multiple sex abuse-related charges.
 According to Marshall County Sheriff’s Office Assistant Chief Deputy Steve Guthrie, Christopher Pruitt, 30, of Boaz, was arrested on charges of sexual abuse of a child under the age of 12 and first-degree sexual abuse.
 He was booked into the Marshall County Jail under $100,000 in bonds, Guthrie said.
 “It is a case worked by our investigators after a report was made to the Department of Human Resources,” he said. “Allegations were made, the victim was interviewed at the Child Advocacy Center and based on that information, we were able to obtain a warrant for his arrest.”
 However, once the warrants were obtained, Pruitt was nowhere to be found. His information and charges were entered into a nationwide database for wanted persons.
 On Monday, a report was made to the Sheriff’s Office of an unattended death within the county, and deputies responded to take a report and the coroner was called.
 “It was discovered the person that had made the report was actually the offender [Pruitt],” Guthrie said. “Once that was made clear, a deputy went back to the residence and made the arrest.”
 Pruitt remains housed in the Marshall County Jail.
 In a separate jail-related matter, Guthrie reported a routine shakedown of the jail annex took place Tuesday morning.
 Guthrie said shakedowns are undertaken routinely to search for contraband, such as drugs or tobacco products, and weapons.
 “I’m proud to say nothing was found other than a razor or two that were broken off a razor they use to shave with,” Guthrie said. “No shanks or other weapons were found.”

Unidentified network activity on computer systems has prompted Lake Region Healthcare to begin an investigation, according to Kent Mattson, CEO. The resulting unavailability of some computer systems has caused disruption to certain operations, said Mattson. “Our patients and staff are safe, but some of our patient care and business service systems are not fully functioning,” he said. “We are utilizing downtime processes for continuity of care, while staff work around the clock with computer specialists to see what caused the disruption, confirm impact, and restore down systems.
 “We have substantial internal and external resources dedicated to restoring systems, and our investigation will be ongoing until it is resolved,” Mattson said. “We appreciate your patience and cooperation during this time. We are dedicated to serving our patients and business partners,” he said. Patients are encouraged to call their provider’s office prior to confirm scheduled appointments or with any questions or concerns, and to bring any current medications with them to their appointment.”
 According to Mattson, LRH has implemented protocols designed for times of interruptions in their computer systems so they are able to continue providing services. “Our efforts are focused on providing safe patient care while working to ensure data and information is safeguarded.
 “We will issue a public announcement when systems have been fully restored so that patients attempting to make payments or other to access other services affected by the outage will know we are back online,” Mattson said.
 Mattson said they will provide relevant updates when available, but no timeline or other details are currently available. The outage impacts Lake Region Healthcare locations in Fergus Falls, Battle Lake, Ashby and Barnesville.

As I begin my fourth winter here in western New York, I remain a novice, certainly in comparison to everyone around me. Before moving to Lockport three winters ago I lived in California for 40 years, then 20 in Bolivia. In both places winter meant temperatures that would occasionally dip into the low 40s, and not a single flake of snow falling from the sky. In South America the planet’s seasons are the opposite of here. I never got used to buying our Christmas tree in sunny and hot mid-summer. But now I have no confusion at all about what season it is.
 The first legitimate northeast winter I ever lived through was in the mid 1980s when I was a graduate student in Boston. On the day of the Super Bowl that year I drove with a friend back to the city from New Hampshire, in a freeze that never topped 0 degrees. It was on that long ride that I learned a fun fact about winter. Volkswagen bugs that have lived in snow for a long time lose their heater boxes to rust. Riding in a freezer for those two hours would have been a good deal warmer.
 That afternoon we joined my classmates in a jammed university atrium to watch the game on a giant TV screen. The San Francisco 49ers were playing at the Stanford University stadium, as close to a Super Bowl home game as you get. The mid-January crowd on TV from the west coast wore only shirt sleeves — not a coat, hat or scarf to be seen. As I sat there still trying to unthaw from the drive I heard myself yelling out loud, “Do you see that!? Don’t you people understand that for thousands of years human beings have migrated out of places like Antarctica!?”

Negotiations between Myanmar's military and the Arakan Army in the wake of the 8 November general election have created the best opportunity in two years to scale back fighting in Rakhine state. The Japan-brokered talks, which are aimed at holding supplementary elections by late January 2021 in Rakhine constituencies where the electoral commission cancelled voting on security grounds, have temporarily halted fighting, enabled tens of thousands of displaced people to return home and brought the sides back to the negotiating table. Holding elections within such a limited timeframe will be a major challenge, however, requiring political will from not only the military and Arakan Army, but also the National League for Democracy (NLD) government, which has so far been reluctant. But elections should not be seen as make or break: even if voting cannot happen in January, there is an opportunity to build on dialogue and reach a formal ceasefire in Myanmar's worst conflict in decades. To seize it, all three of the military, government and Arakan Army will need to make significant concessions.

Some locals have stated that Amazon is the only service not experiencing delays, while most other carriers are.
 “All carriers are delaying packages,” Turlock business owner Beth Mendoza said. “As a shipper I’ve had so many packages delayed and have had so many issues with customers of mine who ordered 3 to 7 day shipping and didn’t get their packages for two weeks to over a month.”
 Both the USPS and FedEx have issued public statements blaming the pandemic for the holiday delays.
 “The U.S. Postal Service, along with the entire shipping sector, continues to face air and trucking capacity challenges caused by a historic volume of mail and other goods being shipped. This challenge has been compounded by temporary employee shortages in some of our 31,000 facilities due to COVID-19 spikes,” a USPS statement reads. “The Postal Service’s 644,000 employees continue to work diligently to address issues and remain focused on delivering the Holidays and beyond for the nation. Amid the historic volume, the Postal Service continues to flex its network, including making sure the right equipment is available to sort, process and deliver a historic volume of mail and packages this holiday season.”
 Regional USPS spokesperson Meiko Patton declined to comment on how long it might take for delayed packages and mail to arrive locally, instead citing the USPS statement. All local inquiries from the Enterprise regarding the delays have been forwarded to the regional office in Sacramento.
 “Our entire team is working around the clock this week to address the historic volume. And as an organization dedicated to public service, we accept all volume presented to us which is adding to our challenges,” the statement reads.
 FedEx has also issued a statement: “The COVID-19 pandemic has created record- breaking shipment volumes. As more people shop online to avoid crowds in stores, those numbers have grown even more. This has created shipping volumes that are taxing logistics networks nationwide, which may cause delays.”

Between March 1 and Dec. 1, there were at least 2,000 flights that either arrived in or departed from Canada with cases of COVID-19 on board, according to data provided PHAC.
 The data shows a significant increase in the number of potential exposures on commercial flights during the fall.
 In March, the number of potential exposures on flights in Canada was 251. By May, when air travel slowed to a trickle, this number shrank to just 30. By October it had increased to 342.
 The number of potential exposures on board flights in Canada in November was 504, according to PHAC.

As a young Republican who doesn’t fit the Democrat’s narrative of what young people should be, it’s no wonder why the Democrats feel the need to attack young Republicans from every angle. We don’t fit their message. Without young people, the Democrats lose — plain and simple. The Democrats think they have the youth vote locked up by using bait issues like student loan forgiveness. However, the Democrats haven’t been the party of young people for a long time. A party that seeks to take more of their paychecks, that only respects their opinion when it’s politically convenient for them and agrees with them, and a party that lies to them about where the Republicans truly stand on the issues. When the Democrats see a young Republican start to make waves and speak his mind, name calling is the first place they go. Racist, mysogenist, Nazi; the list goes on. It’s no wonder people don’t know about the plethora of young Republicans out there who want to share their thoughts and opinions but are too scared due to the fear of being maimed by someone near them with a dissenting opinion.

One of the best features that comes with this phone number tracker is the ability to tag contacts and phone numbers. If there is a person on your kid’s contact list that you feel suspicious about or that you have told your child not to call or answer calls from, then you can tag that person on the mSpy website. When a call from them comes in or your child calls that number or messages them, you will receive a notification. It’s a great way to keep tabs on who your kids are conversing with and whether they are being safe and responsible with their phone.

ZEYNEP BILGINSOY (AP) — A Turkish court has convicted Can Dundar, an exiled journalist, on espionage and terror-related charges for a news report. The court in Istanbul on Wednesday found Dundar guilty of “obtaining secret documents for espionage” and “aiding a terrorist organization,” sentencing him to a total of 27 1/2 years in prison. Dundar, the former editor-in-chief of opposition newspaper Cumhuriyet, was on trial for a 2015 story accusing Turkey’s intelligence service of illegally sending weapons to Syria. Dundar left for Germany in 2016 and was being tried in absentia.

Unknown to me he took ill between Thursday and Friday night. By 4pm on Friday, I was at his gate at the plush Ministers’ quarters, to keep to the Friday appointment but his phone had been switched off, very much unlike him to give an appointment and not keep to it. I called his driver, Zidon, who politely told me oga was at a meeting and he would alert me on return to the house. You can therefore imagine my shock when I woke up to the news of his death on Saturday morning. This is the mystery of life and a poignant moment for me; a man who engaged in several activities up to the hilt was actually on the way out of the world. He had to keep his appointment with God Almighty, his creator.

But her gift to me years ago occupies a top spot on my short list of the best gift ever.

She excused my lippiness and created a one-of-kind coverlet designed just for me - and cherished more each year of her absence.
