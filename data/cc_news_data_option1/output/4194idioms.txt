Five months ago, my older brother by two years got engaged, he is twenty-four years old, so everyone in the family was overjoyed that he finally found his _bashert._ As I too had been dating, it was hoped that I would soon follow with my own engagement and make way for the sister right behind me to follow suit, as their are eight more kids in line after that. With the coronavirus, my brother's wedding was planned for two weeks after the _yomim tovim_ , a small, intimate wedding do to all the restrictions of the pandemic. I was busy with my own search for a life partner and didn't see what was happening with his wedding plans during that time because I did indeed meet a wonderful young man two months ago and we were about to announce our own engagement when my future sister-in-law decided, _erev Rosh Hashanah,_ that she wanted to break off the engagement to my brother. It came to light that there had been plenty of bickering between the parents about wedding finances and such, that when the break-up came about there was so much anger on both sides, my parents didn't even want to hear about my impending good news. So I decided to wait until Rosh Hashanah passed to tell them.

 In case traders are otherwise occupied, a team of analysts at RBC is filling in by collecting its best US small-company stock ideas as the fourth quarter gets underway. It's also timely because after the initial stages of the market's rally were dominated by larger companies, small caps have caught fire recently.
 If stocks follow their historic patterns, smaller companies could be the biggest winners as the economy gets back up to speed following the deep recession earlier this year. And RBC says these companies are on track for both long-term success and substantial gains in the short term.
 The following seven companies are all rated "outperform" by RBC's analysts, and they all have market capitalizations of $5 billion or less. They are reasonably heavily traded, as their average daily volumes top the $10 million market. The septet are all 25% away from their 12-month price targets.
 All of the stocks hail from either the tech sector, the best-performing part of the market in 2020, or from healthcare, which has received new attention as an investment theme in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.
 The stocks are ranked in increasing order of price upside implied by RBC's targets. Percentages were calculated based on Thursday's closing prices.

The stock of Reliance Industries witnessed volatile price action last week. But at a broader level, the stock has been moving in a sideways trend between ₹2,175 and ₹2,300 for over a month.
 It tests the support of ₹2,175, where the 50-day moving average lies. Hence, this level is critical — a decisive breach of this level can bring in more sellers, potentially resulting in a significant fall. The stock has formed a lower high on the daily chart, and a break of ₹2,175 will result in a lower low, adding to the bearish bias.
 Corroborating the negative view, the daily relative strength index has slipped below the midpoint level of 50 and is pointing downwards. The moving average convergence divergence indicator on the daily chart is showing a fresh down- tick. Traders can take a bearish view on the back of the above reasons.
 But since ₹2,175 is a support, initiate fresh short positions if the stock falls below it; the stop-loss can be at ₹2,275. The support below ₹2,175 can be spotted at ₹2,070. Subsequently, the psychological level of ₹2,000 is the key support.

The stock of ITC opened with a gap-up last week and rallied, but the bulls faced a roadblock at ₹175, from where the stock began to decline. Also, the 21-day moving average has been acting as a resistance for the past two weeks, and until the price remains below that level, the stock can be inclined to a downtrend.
 Though the price action for the past couple of weeks shows that the stock has been moving in a sideways trend — between ₹165 and ₹175 — the major trend remains bearish as it has been on a decline since mid-August. This means the likelihood of the price slipping below ₹165 is high.
 Supporting the negative bias, the relative strength index and the moving average convergence divergence indicators on the daily chart remain in their respective bearish territories. On the back of the above factors, traders can initiate fresh short positions on rallies with a stop-loss at ₹175.
 The stock will most likely decline to ₹157 in the near term. A breach of this level can drag it towards a support at ₹146. The resistance above ₹175 is at ₹181.

 In 2016, he attracted controversy for handing out balloons made of inflated condoms to police officers on the fifth anniversary of the 2011 uprising that toppled former President Hosni Mubarak and had been aimed at reforming the state's heavy-handed security apparatus.

Robots can flip burgers and fry sides, and Miso Robotics is selling its burger-flipping robot as the perfect fry cook for the COVID-19 era.
 Robot assistant Flippy just became commercially available for $30,000, or on a payment plan, with plans to eventually lower the price. Flippy is attached to a rail under the kitchen hood to move back and forth while manning the grill and fryer.
 "After we shared a sneak peek of the prototype in January, we've seen demand through the roof from operators, especially in light of COVID-19" Miso Robotics CEO Mike Bell said in a press release. The coronavirus pandemic has hit restaurants hard, but fast-food chains have recovered faster with the drive-thru and takeout business not relying on indoor dining, compared to fast-casual chains.
 During the pandemic, fast food employees have become essential workers, and labor issues like lack of paid sick time and low wages were thrown into the spotlight. Robots like Flippy in the kitchen could keep fast food locations competitive despite "smaller margins, less foot traffic and new health and safety concerns," Miso says.

They conquered withered vineyards and left behind burnt carcases of tanks to plant an Azerbaijani flag atop a barren hill on the edge of Nagorno-Karabakh -- overlooking nothing at all.
 Fighting erupted three weeks ago between Christian ethnic Armenians and Muslim Azerbaijan over a blood-soaked patch of mountains both call part of their ancestral lands.
 The Azerbaijani side has spent days trumpeting military successes that give the air of an army on the move.
 "If they don't leave on their own, we'll chase them out like dogs," President Ilham Aliyev said on the eve of a new ceasefire on Sunday that both sides accused the other of immediately breaking.
 On Twitter, Aliyev lists towns his forces have recaptured for the first time since a 1994 truce ended a war that killed 30,000 and left the region -- to the horror of Azerbaijanis -- in separatist hands.
 One of these towns is Jabrayil.
 Yet it is not just empty after being trapped in a no-mans land splitting Nagorno-Karabakh proper from territory under Azerbaijani control -- there is simply no trace of it left.
 The valley rolling down from the hill with the flag is covered with craggy bushes and a few low outlines of brick walls that have been blasted apart by rival forces for a generation.
 \- 'Fight to the last drop of blood' -
 Jabrayil's lone standing structure is a cliff-like monument equipped with running faucets that the Soviets erected to encourage "friendship and inter- ethnic peace".
 A machine-gun toting soldier climbed this to unfurl an Azerbaijani flag before a clutch of reporters given access to a tightly controlled press tour of recaptured lands.
 "Our enemy should know that Azerbaijani soldiers will fight to their last drop of blood to protect their motherland -- and to sacrifice their lives if required," Colonel Elshat Habilov declared before ordering the reporters back out.
 "As we liberate our occupied lands one by one, we are gaining morale, drawing ever closer to a great victory."
 That Aliyev's army wanted to showcase its hold on this uninhabited hill articulates Azerbaijan's desire to put behind it the trauma of the 1988-1994 war.
 It ended with Azerbaijan losing both Nagorno-Karabakh and surrounding areas such as Jabrayil and the nearby district of Fuzuli running along the Iranian border.
 These provide access points to the southern gates of Nagorno-Karabakh and its capital Stepanakert.
 \- Piles of bricks -
 Azerbaijan it trying to recapture the region by moving in from its southern and northern ends.
 Most of its military successes have come on the border area of the conflict zone.
 The exchanges of mortar and artillery fire on the north end around Terter are almost ceaseless and require residents to spend most of their time sheltering in basements.
 But Azerbaijani men in fatigues raised their fists in triumph and looked at ease as they smoked along the country road leading into Jabrayil.
 The tank guns and artillery pieces were still trained on the mountains but the soldiers manning them sat around campfires or idled away the time in the fields.
 Wooden sticks dotted dried fields that once held up lush grapevines behind them.
 Shoulder-high piles of bricks suggested the shape of houses that once lined the road.
 Habilov struggled to recall the last time anyone lived in these valleys or how many people had called Jabrayil their home.
 The Azerbaijani frontline is dotted with camps for families who have been forced to abandon such places.
 "We have reclaimed ruins," Habilov said as he herded reporters out before the sun set over the Caucasus mountains.
 "But we are also reclaiming our territorial integrity," he said.

The Tesla Model 3 is far and away the best-selling electric car in the country, making up nearly half of all US EV sales in 2019. That popularity has given rise to a massive market for Model 3 body kits and accessories targeted at owners looking to set their car apart from the pack.
 Now Startech, a sub-brand of famed Mercedes-Benz tuner Brabus, is getting into the Tesla-makeover game as well, announcing a whole suite of customizations for the Model 3 that give the EV a sportier look and, according to the firm, enhance its performance.
 The German firm unveiled add-ons including new wheels, faux-carbon accents, aggressive front and rear bumpers, lowering springs, and aerodynamic upgrades. It'll also reupholster your Model 3's interior and paint over any chrome pieces you deem too shiny.
 The entire package will be available starting in early 2021 through Startech's worldwide dealer network and online, a spokesperson told Business Insider. Take a closer look below.

He understood that coalitions hinged more on personality, loyalty born of friendship and mutual respect, and continuous communication, than rigid structure.

But it was in grade school where he learned to forge “coalitions” of kids to foil the bullies waiting to beat them up outside the school building. Banding together with other kids from different ethnic backgrounds illustrated the need to work together to achieve a common and greater good – i.e., not getting beat up. With that background, Jim transformed the progressive coalition in Montana into a truly impressive political force.

(WLBT) - With a little more than two weeks left until the November 3rd election, the Medgar and Myrlie Evers Institute is teaming up with national and local organizations stressing the importance of voting.Evers' daughter, Reena Evers-Everette, said it’s imperative that everyone exercise their right to vote during this election cycle.“We have to make our voices heard because our quality of life is critical,” she expressed. "The sacrifices that so many have made will be in vain if we don’t go out and vote.”Her father died fighting for everyone to have the right to vote.During an event on Saturday, standing outside the home where Evers was killed, she spoke on the importance of carrying out her dad’s legacy.“His dedication, and he knew what his mission was, which was empowering all, but empowering people, his people, especially in Mississippi,” she said.The institute educates people on combating voter suppression, knowing what’s on their ballots, and understanding their responsibility of making their vote count.The organization is partnering with March On, a national organization that travels all over the U.S. encouraging people to vote.Both organizations say voting this year is a must.“There have been some instances where people have been subjected to some voter suppression tactics and we want to make sure that people know what their rights are and how important it is for them to let their voices be heard,” said Courtney Cockrell, Evers' great-niece and legal team of March On’s Voter Protection Corps.“We’ve seen long lines across the country, we want to encourage people to stay the course," said Corrie Cockrell, Evers' great-niece and legal team of March On’s Voter Protection Corps. “Have a plan when you go to the polls.”“Education is what’s most important to let people know where to go, when they can go,” said Courtney Cockrell. "A lot of states have early voting so letting people know what that process looks like and how that differentiates from absentee voting. Just the whole education piece to me is a major combat to any voter suppression efforts.”Copyright 2020 WLBT. All rights reserved.

Their youngest son, Kieran, had asked Jim and Arlene if they had any special plans for their anniversary, which was on August 29. Arlene replied they would go somewhere to have a hot dog as they do every year on their anniversary. No big steak dinners. No night out dancing. Just hot dogs. She couldn't remember how long they had this tradition but “forever” seemed like a good fit. It was a day for Jim and Arlene to reflect back to their very humble beginnings. They never forgot where they came from and their anniversary was a great day to celebrate their journey together – with hot dogs. Five years ago Kieran and his wife Sherri decided they would follow suit and now they celebrate Jim and Arlene's journey together every August 29 – with hot dogs.

BANGKOK (AP) — Pro-democracy activists in Thailand launched their fifth straight day of protests on Sunday, scheduling demonstrations not just in the capital but also at several other locations around the country.
 The demonstrators received a new warning from police that they are violating the law. On Saturday, however, few people were arrested as peaceful rallies were held at several points around Bangkok, the capital, with several thousand people taking part.
 The protest movement — which is calling for the prime minister's resignation, a more democratic constitution and a reformed monarchy — began in March at universities around the country. After a lull due to the coronavirus crisis, it was revived in late July, building up strength, particularly in Bangkok.
 On Sunday, rallies were called in at least a dozen provinces, including Chiang Mai, a popular tourist destination in northern Thailand.
 The authorities in Bangkok tried in vain to keep people from gathering by selectively shutting down stations on Bangkok’s elevated and underground mass transit lines. On Saturday, after protest organizers urged followers to meet at the city’s Skytrain stations, they ordered all stations to be closed, to little avail.
 The current cycle of confrontations began before dawn Thursday, when police broke up an overnight rally outside Government House, which hosts the offices of Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha. It led Prayuth to declare a state of emergency, banning gatherings of more than five people and allowing the government extra powers to keep the peace.

Catholic High couldn’t overcome a sluggish start in Friday’s District 7-2A showdown with Ascension Episcopal.
 The visiting Blue Gators (2-0, 1-0) scored on their first three possessions to take a 21-0 lead and then held off the Panthers in the second half to claim a 28-14 win. It marks Catholic High’s first district loss in four years.
 “Tip of the hat to Matt Desormeaux,” CHS head coach Scott Wattigny said of the AES coach. “They did a great job.
 “You saw them jump out to a 21-0 lead, and then secure a 28-7 halftime score. Credit to those guys. They fought their tails off and deserved to win.”
 AES quarterback Ethan Simon darted 48 yards around the right end on the first place from scrimmage to set up a TD pass to Austin Mills.
 After CHS made one first down, its offense bogged down and the Blue Gators blocked the ensuing punt to set up another Simon TD pass to 6-foot-5 receiver Jude Ardoin.
 Following a three-and-out by the Panthers, AES running back Cole Edmond sprinted 58 yards to make it 21-0 with 3:54 remaining in the first quarter.
 “For whatever reason, those big early plays stunned us on defense,” Wattigny said. “I don’t know if we came out flat. We went a quick 3-and-out a few times in the first half, especially early in the first quarter, and we were trying to limit the opportunities for their quarterback.”
 In the third quarter, the Panthers (1-2, 1-1) were stopped twice on fourth down near the AES goal-line.
 “It was a tale of two halves,” Wattigny said. “I thought we had them on the ropes in the second half. We were in the red zone multiple times.
 “We have to finish. That was the same situation with De La Salle. We’re not like sharks right now. We’re not smelling blood in the water in the red zone.”
 After he was limited to 42 yards rushing in the first half, CHS quarterback KK Reno finished with 152 yards on 30 attempts with a touchdown.
 “In the first half, we weren’t identifying their defense the way we should have,” Wattigny said. “We weren’t seeing what they were presenting. Once we did, we had tons of success. But it doesn’t matter how many yards you get if you can’t score.
 “We have to finish blocks. We have to have a will to get in there into the end zone. We made some silly mistakes. Twice, we didn’t punch it in where we could have made it a 28-21 game. That was a complete momentum swing.”
 Marco Austin, Trace Williams and Willie Regard combined for 137 yards rushing and Layne Lipari scored a touchdown in the second half.
 “Conditioning wise, I thought we were in great position,” Wattigny said. “They were starting to wear down.
 “I thought our big bodies and offensive scheme were doing what we need to do, but it doesn’t matter how long you have the ball and how many yards you have if you don’t score any points.”
 Wattigny wasn’t pleased with the Panthers’ extracurricular activity. CHS was penalized multiple times for personal fouls, including a fourth-quarter incident where a punch was thrown after the whistle.
 “I’m utterly disappointed in what I saw tonight as a very poor reflection of me,” he said. “I saw a lot of unnecessary personal fouls. Those are actions I’m not proud of. Those actions aren’t a reflection of our school and the team and what we stand for.
 “I’m disappointed in myself more than anything. I just got done saying that to our guys. This isn’t anybody else’s fault. This is my fault. We’re going to get it corrected. I’m not going to watch what I watched tonight. I’m not talking about the loss. I’m talking about our actions with the penalties.”

Twitter has had a busy week -- perhaps even busier than when a colossal hack took over the site this past summer.
 On Wednesday, the New York Post, owned by Fox News mogul Rupert Murdoch's News Corp, published a dubious report purporting to show evidence that Hunter Biden, the son of Democratic presidential hopeful Joe Biden, was in cahoots with a Ukrainian official. You can read a digestible timeline of the erratic series of events spelled out in the article here. (The FBI is now investigating whether the emails were part of a foreign intelligence operation.)
 Though the story was riddled with holes, Republicans swiftly latched onto it as affirmation of conspiracy theories they've long pedaled involving the Biden family and Ukraine. The publication also faced criticism from some who feared the story was designed to spread disinformation ahead of the 2020 presidential election.
 As users began to share the story on Twitter, the company responded by banning the URL from being tweeted, therefore limiting how many people could read it, without offering an explanation as to why. The company locked the Trump campaign's official Twitter account, @TeamTrump, after it referred to the NY Post story. White House spokesperson Kayleigh McEnany's account was also suspended.

 He awoke to a thump and splashing and pressed on her stomach because he was worried she'd swallowed water. He then determined she was breathing, dressed her and put her to bed before her mother returned, he claimed.
 After Steele's claim police found Jo'nyri's "severe bodily injuries" were not consistent with a fall and had resulted from abuse.
 She had likely been punched or kicked in the stomach so hard it ruptured her liver and spleen.

Abedi's first was on May 18 - ahead of a Take That concert.
 He arrived at 6.18pm and left at 6.39pm.
 At 6.35pm, the inquiry was told Abedi was standing looking at box office queues in the City Room. He remained there for more than a minute, CCTV showed, then walked back to the tram stop.
 He 'observed people queuing to get into the Arena', the inquiry was told, but is not thought to have taken photographs.
 On May 21, 2017, the day before the attack, Abedi arrived at the Victoria tram stop at 6.53pm and made a 'direct journey' to the City Room.
 He was shown sitting on a wall there for six minutes, on a phone as people walked past.
 He then walked up stairs to the mezzanine area of the City Room, before walking back down and out of the area, only to return five minutes later and walk straight across the City Room before leaving the complex.

Being in quarantine while pregnant was scary because I kept hearing how I may be at higher risk for getting COVID-19. After reading many articles and talking to other pregnant women, there was no conclusive evidence. So, I was left to assess my own risk.  I also felt an immense responsibility to not only protect myself, but the life growing inside me. I spent the first half of quarantine living in a nightmare, too worried about contracting the virus, whether it was from going to doctor's appointments or checking the mail. Being pregnant and seeing all these social media posts of people starting their "better self" journeys made me want to overload my days with endless tasks. I kept trying to compete with strangers because I felt inadequate with how I handled things. Especially because I was pregnant, it felt that I was using my pregnancy as a crutch if I wanted to take it easy one day.

 Investment professionals have been arguing for years that General Motors, now aiming to produce 22 new electrified vehicles by 2023, is horribly undervalued. But the play there is perhaps to buy GM stock with the hope that the company decides to spin off its electric business, something Wall Street has agitated for but that GM's management has been avoiding.

Shortly before the clock struck 9 pm on Saturday, restaurant shutters in Paris came down and people dashed home to beat a strict new curfew to battle the coronavirus outbreak.
 Police patrolled streets which would ordinarily be bustling with party-goers to enforce the new anti-mingling measure as the country notched up a record of more than 32,000 positive Covid-19 tests in 24 hours, with 1,868 people in intensive care.
 Densely-populated Paris has been an infection hotspot, with bars already shuttered since October 6 although restaurants and other establishments that serve food were allowed to stay open.
 Alcohol sales are prohibited from 10 pm and face masks are compulsory in public both indoors and outside.
 But there has been concern over people, especially youngsters, flouting face coverings and social distancing rules to gather in groups on restaurant terraces and in other public places.
 This prompted the government to announce a 9 pm to 6 am curfew for Paris and a dozen other French cities -- some 20 million inhabitants in all -- and impose a limit of six on home gatherings blamed for a large proportion of new infections.
 The curfew will remain in place for at least four weeks.
 At 10 pm on Saturday, the streets of the City of Light were eerily empty apart from a few stragglers risking a 135-euro ($158) fine unless they can provide a certificate to show they have good reason to be out and about.
 "I'm coming back from the hospital Curie where my daughter is being operated on. They gave me this proof," one man tells a group of police officers, presenting a piece of paper.
 "That's fine, good evening sir," one replied as he handed back the document.
 \- 'There is no-one left' -
 Food delivery employees zigzagged the streets on bikes or scooters, bringing meals to now home-bound diners in a city where it is common to sit down to a meal after 9 pm.
 A handful of municipal buses circulated without impediment down unusually car- free lanes, though mostly empty themselves. Metros and trains also continue operating to ferry people who have no choice but to break the curfew, whether for work or medical reasons.
 Paris has not known a curfew since 1961, which was limited at the time to Muslims amid unrest over the Algerian war of independence from France.
 Before that, a curfew was in place in the capital during the Nazi occupation of France in World War II.
 On Saturday, a total of 1,350 police and gendarmes were deployed in Paris and its suburbs to ensure compliance with the latest restrictions -- the strictest since a two-month lockdown ended in May.
 "It is telling. It is 9 pm and there is no-one left," police commissioner Patrick Caron said as the curfew took effect.
 "It is no longer time for education (about the measures) but for sanction," he added. Fines can increase to 3,750 euros or prison time for multiple infractions.
 But for the first night at least, members of Caron's police team in the Latin Quarter -- a favourite with students and tourists -- were left twiddling their thumbs and musing among themselves about the strange times we are living in.
 Curfews are also in place in the cities of Lille, Lyon, Toulouse, Montpellier, Saint-Etienne, Aix-Marseille, Rouen and Grenoble.
 Health ministry figures on Saturday showed a record coronavirus-positive rate of 13.1 percent of people tested -- up from nine percent 10 days ago and 3.4 percent last month.
 \- In it together -
 More than 1,200 people have been admitted to intensive care in a week. France now has 5,800 intensive care beds available.
 At the height of the epidemic, the country dealt with some 7,000 intensive care patients at once, more than the beds available before the outbreak hit.
 In total, 10,399 people are now in hospital for coronavirus in France -- an increase of 378 from Friday to Saturday alone.
 Ninety people died in these 24 hours, bringing the total to 33,392.
 "I remain confident in the sense of responsibility of the immense majority of my fellow citizens," Prime Minister Jean Castex said of the curfew on Saturday.
 "Everyone must understand that we can make it through this only with the daily effort of each one of us, in our professional and personal lives," he said.
