Since his 2016 campaign, Trump has repeatedly promised to unveil a new healthcare plan but never followed through. Late last month, he signed a toothless executive order proclaiming the government would protect people with preexisting conditions.
 The upswing in support for the Affordable Care Act is just the latest twist in the political history of President Obama’s chief legislative accomplishment. It has been buffeted by legal challenges, reaching the Supreme Court twice before, and undermined by Trump administration policies. But its core features — the preexisting conditions coverage, a national marketplace for individuals to buy insurance, premium subsidies for the needy, expanded Medicaid in most states — remain in place.
 “Everyone knows we can’t forfeit billions of dollars of our GDP to a right- wing flight of fancy,” said Sam Petsonk, a Democrat running for attorney general in West Virginia, where at least 160,000 people would lose their health insurance if Obamacare were repealed.
 The GOP incumbent in that race, Patrick Morrisey, is a leader of the effort by conservative states to repeal the law, giving the Democrat a rich target. Democrats running for attorney general in other conservative states are also running on saving Obamacare, a once-unthinkable move.

POTTSVILLE — Some County residents who have yet to receive their mail-in ballots are worried.


  Steve Barrows, Schuylkill Haven, said he and three other members of his household all submitted applications for mail-in ballots in May and had been approved. However, all four received the same email Saturday saying their applications had been declined due to “duplicate applications.”


  “We hadn’t made a second application,” Barrows said. “It was entirely out of the blue.”


  Barrows said he had checked his ballot status online before receiving that message, and it said his ballot had been mailed. As of Wednesday, Barrows had not yet received his ballot.


  Schuylkill County Election Bureau Director Albert L. Gricoski said Wednesday the bureau is still processing mail-in ballot applications, filling envelopes and sending out ballots.


  “We just started mailing them out last week,” Gricoski said. “We understand the concern, but it’s a process.”


  As of Wednesday, Gricoski estimated between 17,000 to 18,000 mail-in ballots have been requested in Schuylkill County, and around 10,000 have been sent out so far.


  Connor Matz, technology coordinator for the Election Bureau, said there have been many duplicate applications, mostly from people who had requested to receive a mail-in ballot when they voted by mail in the primary election.


  “They may have sent in a paper application after the primary election and also an online application,” Matz said. “If their account is linked to their email, they would have gotten a message saying their application was denied, but the first one will still be processed.”


  As long as the first application was approved, Gricoski said they will receive their ballot.


  Cheryl Humes, Tamaqua, said she applied for a mail-in ballot in August, but when she checked her status online it said, “We are unable to match your information with our records.” Humes reapplied but received the same message and was unable to get in contact with the Elections Bureau.


  Humes, who will be working as a poll observer on election day, said her main question is what should people do if they are approved for a mail-in ballot but do not receive one in time.


  “If I don’t get my mail-in ballot, the most important thing is to be able to vote,” Humes said. “I’ll go to my precinct and vote. Poll observing is secondary.”


  Gricoski said if someone does not receive a mail-in ballot on time, they do have the option to vote in person. They will fill out a provisional ballot, which will be matched up with their application information before being counted, Gricoski said.


  Cody Barry, Pine Grove, said he had checked the status of his mail-in ballot online, but the website said it could not find his records. Barry said he spoke with someone at the Election Bureau who told him his name was in the system, but his request was still being processed.


  “It’s 20 days, 14 business days from the election and no ballot,” Barry said. “That’s concerning.”


  Barry said he has taken off work on Election Day in case he needs to go vote in person.


  According to Gricoski, the bureau has been receiving new applications every day, and it takes time to double check each person’s information and voter registration status, so applications may not be fully processed yet. The deadline to apply for a mail-in ballot is Oct. 27.


  Gricoski advised people to check their status online and be patient, as the bureau has been receiving an influx of calls and visits to their office.


  Voters may hand in their mail-in ballots to the office or bring them to fill out in person. However, because of the increased traffic to the Election Bureau office, Gricoski said the best method of returning the ballot would be by mail.


  Humes said she does not have any suspicion of voter fraud or doubt in the Election Bureau. She just thinks the bureau should inform voters of what is happening.


  “I’m sure they’re overwhelmed,” Humes said. “They need to keep anxiety levels down, because people are concerned about the integrity of the ballots.”

Used to staying behind the scenes, executives at the biotech firm are now calling on Switzerland and other governments to tackle the problems in the antibiotics market before it’s too late.


  ## Risky research


  As a family-owned private company, Debiopharm is in an enviable position compared to many biotechs in the antibiotics business. Not only does it have the finances, but it also has the independence from shareholders.


  “We can take risks that others can’t,” said Mauvernay, who joined in 2001 the company founded by his father.


  Last year US-based Achaogen was one of at least two antibiotics start-ups that filed for bankruptcy. Despite developing an antibiotic that could treat complicated urinary tract infections, Achaogen couldn’t make enough profit to stay afloat.


  By 2050, some 10 million people worldwide could die each year if new antibiotics don’t come on the market, according to the World Health Organization. Experts warn that the Covid-19 pandemic is only making the situation worse due to longer hospital stays that increase the risk of secondary bacterial infections.

HARRISBURG — After Pennsylvania lawmakers failed for months to fix a troubled rent relief program, Gov. Tom Wolf intervened Tuesday, giving landlords flexibility to collect outstanding balances in the hope that more would agree to participate.


  As a result of the change, landlords will no longer be required to forgive rent that is owed if they collect the state relief money. Landlords can receive a monthly maximum of $750 per tenant, but previously were forced to forgive any rent due in excess of that amount.


  Landlords who take part in the program will now be able to enter into payment plans with tenants for the remaining balance owed.


  In many parts of the state, $750 is significantly less than the average monthly rent, and the forgiveness requirement was a driving factor in many landlords choosing not to participate. Without their landlords on board, renters cannot take advantage of the relief.


  “These are positive steps, but we still need a larger solution,” Wolf said in a news release. “I continue to urge the legislature to fix the program’s other flaws so more struggling families have a place to live.”


  The shortcomings of the $150 million rent relief program, funded with federal CARES Act dollars, have been clear since it launched in early July. But the Republican-controlled legislature has so far not acted on addressing them, despite urging from the governor, the agency overseeing the program and advocates for both landlords and tenants.


  Wolf’s changes do not increase the amount of money landlords can receive, which would require the legislature to amend the state law that created the program.


  In many cases, property management companies have already been working out payment plans with tenants who have fallen behind, said Leah Sailhamer, vice president of government affairs at the Pennsylvania Apartment Association.


  “Allowing us to participate in the program and still work out our plans definitely makes the program more attractive,” she said, adding that, ultimately, the group still wants to see a legislative fix to the program.


  The program has also been hampered by a lengthy application process that requires tenants to submit extensive paperwork to prove they are eligible. By the end of September, only $9.6 million of the $150 million available had been paid out, raising concerns that the program could end with money left over despite the urgent need.


  Thousands of families across the state are at risk of losing their homes amidst the economic crisis caused by the coronavirus pandemic. A federal order protects some tenants from eviction until the end of the year, but advocates warn of a surge in evictions come January.


  “This change potentially sets up tenants with significant debt that they will be unable to pay,” said Phyllis Chamberlain, executive director of the Housing Alliance of Pennsylvania, an advocacy group. “For many, it will only temporarily delay an eviction filing.”


  Lawmakers are weighing a proposal to streamline the application process and make the program more appealing to landlords. The legislation would replace the $750 cap with a more flexible standard that varies from region to region, reduce the amount of paperwork applicants must submit and eliminate a requirement that tenants must already be at least a month behind on rent to apply.


  But a crucial House vote on the bill was delayed earlier this month after a Republican lawmaker announced he had tested positive for the coronavirus and the voting session was abruptly cancelled.


  Rep. Sue Helm (R., Dauphin), the bill’s sponsor, said she hoped for a vote on Monday. The state Senate would still need to pass the legislation before the changes could go into effect.


  Even if that happens, the changes would not have long to take effect. The current deadline for accepting applications, which Wolf extended by executive order last week, is Nov. 4.


  Lawmakers could extend that deadline further, but not by much: under state law, all of Pennsylvania’s CARES funding must be spent by the end of November.

Political advertising often traffics in borderline truths, gross exaggerations and statements taken out of context. But slate mailers may be the worst of the breed. Candidates and ballot measure committees pay for endorsements on slate mailers from wholesome-sounding groups like the “Coalition for Senior Citizen Security” or “Millennials for Effective Government.” The groups are, by and large, fake. The mailers are paid campaign advertisements with little connection to reality.
 And it’s all perfectly legal — as long as each mailer discloses who produced the ad and which candidates or campaigns paid for the endorsement. Slate mailer organizations are also required to file campaign finance statements with the state that detail who bought what endorsement on each mailer.
 But just because slate mailers are legal doesn’t make them good for an informed citizenry. Sure, many voters see through the sham. Still, campaigns shell out thousands and thousands of dollars each election season hoping to sway at least some people with these misleading mailers.
 Assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez (D-San Diego) tweeted this week that she plans to introduce a bill next year to require more disclosure on slate mailers, including who is paying for the endorsements and how many members belong to the groups behind the mailers. In political campaigns, more disclosure and more transparency are always better for voters.

Growers in Monterey County are scrambling to respond after Canadian food safety officials placed restrictions on the import of romaine lettuce from the Salinas Valley due to past E. coli outbreaks.


  In an unprecedented move that shocked local growers and U.S. government officials, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency declared new trade standards for romaine and mixed salads containing romaine beginning on Oct. 7 through the end of the year.


  Romaine lettuce is banned from entering Canada if it came from the counties of Monterey, Santa Cruz, San Benito and Santa Clara, unless the romaine shipments from these areas are specifically tested for E. coli by a certified laboratory. Growers say this would be costly and impractical given current testing capacity.


  “We are trying to get to the bottom of this decision to put up additional restrictions right at the height of the season,” says Norm Groot, executive director of the Monterey County Farm Bureau. “It caught us all by surprise. The restrictions are not justified by science and don’t take into account the steps we have taken to further prevent any contamination.”


  Groot says that he and other industry representatives have been in touch with federal officials from the Department of Agriculture, the Food and Drug Administration and the Office of the United States Trade Representative.


  “[The federal representatives] are negotiating with Canada,” Groot says. “They sent a proposal and we’re waiting for a response.”


  U.S. Rep Jimmy Panetta, D-Carmel Valley, released a statement right after the Canadian announcement, calling it an “unwelcome surprise” that is not based on sound science.


  “As the representative of the ‘Salad Bowl of the World,’ I will continue to do everything I can to fight these harmful requirements and ensure that safe Salinas Valley romaine has fair access to the Canadian market,” he said.


  It is too early to quantify impacts but they will be substantial, according to Groot. “We can look from a historical perspective and Canada is one of our most important trading partners,” he says.


  The annual crop report for Monterey County shows that local growers sold more produce by volume to Canada than any other country over the past two years. At 110 million pounds, lettuce, which includes romaine and other varietals, was the top agricultural export in 2019. In dollar terms, romaine was near the top among all crops, bringing in $695 million in revenue.


  The Canadians said that the decision was prompted by investigations that tied a series of outbreaks to the Salinas Valley.


  “From 2016 to 2019, romaine lettuce from California was linked to outbreaks of E. coli illnesses in the USA and Canada,” the Canadian Food Inspection Agency said in a statement. “To mitigate risk in the event of another outbreak this fall, the CFIA is implementing these temporary import measures aimed at preventing contaminated food from entering the marketplace.”


  The most recent outbreak took place last fall and was traced to packaged salads shipped throughout the U.S. and Canada. Dozens of people were hospitalized, leading the USDA to put out a food safety advisory.

There are some position groups on every college football team that enter seasons with mystery. If there was ever one that didn’t in Happy Valley, it’s the 2020 offensive line.


  Everything seems pretty simple, after all. The Nittany Lions return five players with extensive experience as starters. One is a center. Two are guards. The two others are tackles. It’s a veritable blueprint, signed and delivered to new offensive line coach Phil Trautwein, on how to proceed.


  Turns out, one of the offense’s most intriguing decisions heading into the season opener at Indiana on Oct. 24 will be made on the offensive line. It’s a choice between staying the course or preparing for the future.


  On his weekly radio show last week, head coach James Franklin said Will Fries, a senior who has started 24 career games and seemed a lock to open the season as the starting right tackle, has been splitting his time between tackle and guard during camp.


  “Part of that,” Franklin said, “is we think (guard) may be Will’s future at the next level.”


  There’s another really big part of it, though: 6-foot-5, 335-pound freshman Caedan Wallace.


  A former four-star recruit who played in four games as a true freshman last season, Wallace drew rave reviews from coaches last season and it seems at least possible he could upset the offensive line’s expected formation.


  In Trautwein’s first season since replacing Matt Limegrover as position coach, the Nittany Lions have a chance to become bigger and more athletic through experimentation.


  Senior Michal Menet is safe as the starter at center, for sure. But moving Fries to right guard could give the Nittany Lions a bigger option than the 285-pound expected starter, Mike Miranda. CJ Thorpe, a 322-pound junior, would then compete for the left guard spot with Miranda, while Penn State goes with two underclassmen at the tackle spots, Wallace and impressive sophomore Rasheed Walker.


  It’s up in the air at this point whether a move will be made, but for all the talk about experience and the comfort that brings up front, Wallace is proof Penn State’s strength along the offensive line isn’t necessarily the fact that so many guys have so much experience.


  “(It) is the amount of depth we have,” Menet said. “Whether there are moving parts or not, we have plenty of guys who can step up and play the role. There’s not going to be a drop-off. That’s one of our strongest points this year.”

Small police departments across the country find themselves tasked with handling emergency situations from civil unrest to hostage situations, often beyond their manpower and resources.


  Response from outside agencies can take hours when minutes matter.


  Bridging the gap and putting boots on the streets quickly will be the goal of the Carbon County Emergency Response Task Force.


  The formation of the task force, announced this week by Carbon District Attorney Michael S. Greek and Sheriff Anthony C. Harvilla, will bring together sheriff’s deputies and local law enforcement as a team with specialized training and equipment.


  Greek saw the need for such a task force as an assistant district attorney and appreciates the collaboration with the county’s sheriff department, which has the manpower, talent and training beyond a county security force, he said.


  In addition, the sheriff’s office will partner with local law enforcement in the task force and together seek training and equipment to respond to higher- risk incidents throughout the county, Greek said.


  Manpower, training and equipment are the key components in addressing large- scale issues and the task force will be able to answer this call, Harvilla said.


  Alternative funding sources will be sought to cover training and equipment for the task force, which will need commitments from local communities and their police departments, he said


  The task force is in its early stages, Harvilla said, and will take time to come together. Training, however, is already planned for personnel in his department and a local agency as early as next month, he said.


  Those officers will then in turn train other task force members, providing the groundwork for one of two response units, Harvilla said.


  One unit will be able to provide crowd control for incidents involving large disturbances or civil unrest, while another, smaller unit will move in on specialized responses where a Specialized Emergency Response Team may be needed, he said.


  This smaller task force unit won’t handle the entire response, but do what is needed to prepare while a SERT unit is being deployed, Harvilla said. They may hold a perimeter, deal with emergency management and make sure that other units can go straight into the incident, he said.


  Harvilla envisions all of his deputies being involved in training for the crowd-control type situations, where a group of officers interested and willing to serve will be recruited for the smaller, specialized group, he said.


  Funding will be an issue moving forward, but they’re hoping that local municipalities will be willing to commit one of their officers to serve on the task force, Harvilla said. Meetings will be held with communities throughout the county to secure their support, he said.


  These communities must be willing to have one of their officers respond to incidents in other communities, but will be reassured to know there will be officers to respond when an incident hits their community as well, he said.


  Plus, agencies that provide funding for training and equipment for these types of units look favorably upon multiple communities working together and serving larger areas, Harvilla said.


  The task force will also provide for responses that a small department just can’t provide on their own, Greek said. The task force will also help in situations being seen more frequently in the area, such as individuals barricaded in a home or high-risk search warrants, the district attorney said.


  “The objective is to provide the County of Carbon and all local communities with a professional team of personnel trained to handle unique policing incidents requiring additional and specialized manpower,” Greek said.


  Harvilla added that he is glad to partner with other agencies to expand their capabilities and increase efforts to ensure residents’ safety.

I can only speculate, but I suspect it’s probably one or the other (or a combination of two) reasons. First, I suspect that the number of scientists and doctors who are antivaccine enough to be willing to sign their names to such a document is so small that it would not be very impressive or convincing. Second, many antivaccine doctors are into “autism biomed” quackery and grift. It’s possible that they are reluctant to “go public” and draw the attention of the FDA or state medical boards to their activities. These reasons could be wrong, but they are all I could come up with.

Love is in the air for deer and that's bad news for motorists who travel the roads of Southeastern Massachusetts.


  From now until early December is deer rutting season, a time of the year where deer mate and motorists are likely to see them moving around on the highways and byways of Bristol County.


  "Historically, this is the time of year when we see the increase in deer strikes," said Acushnet Police Chief Christopher Richmond.


  "They're everywhere. 'Tis the season," said Swansea Police Chief George Arruda, adding he has seen as many as a half dozen on the property behind the police station on G.A.R. Highway.


  "Where there is one, there's always another one," said Detective Kyle Costa, the spokesman for the Dartmouth Police Department. "They're more active during matting season so be cognizant of that also."


  Since Jan. 1 of this year, there have been about 16 deer strikes in Acushnet and another 8 to 10 calls in which deer were found along the sides of road and the assumption is that a vehicle hit the deer and left, according to Richmond,


  During the same time period, there have been 14 deer strikes in Swansea, Chief Arruda said.


  AAA Northeast of Massachusetts released an advisory Tuesday, urging motorists that this is the time of year when deer strikes are most likely to happen and that last year Bristol County had the most deer crashes of any county in Massachusetts.


  In 2019, there were 1,557 deer strikes in Massachusetts, an average of one every two hours, according to AAA. Bristol County had 268 strikes for the period of October through December, and 533 for the entire year.


  Drivers should be especially careful after dark, AAA says. From October to December of last year, 81 percent of the deer crashes in Bristol County occurred when it was dark. Crashes were most common from 5 to 7 p.m., during evening rush hour and when darkness had just set in.


  "Drivers should always be on the lookout for hazards on the road, but the danger of deer is particularly acute in the fall," said Diana Gugliotta, AAA Northeast Senior Manager of Public Affairs. "Deer present dangers to themselves, vehicles and vehicle occupants, so it behooves everybody to be prepared."


  Police say deer crashes, especially when high speeds are involved on highways, are dangerous to motorists and their passengers. Serious damage results when a vehicle traveling upwards to 70 to 80 mph strikes a 150-pound deer, they said. Often motorists swerve their vehicles to avoid hitting a deer and hit a pole or another vehicle.


  Police said their own cruisers also have been heavily damaged and sometimes totaled after striking a deer.


  Bristol County saw several high-profile and heart-breaking crashes in October and November of last year involving deer.


  • A 16-year-old Taunton boy was killed when he was ejected from the rear hatchback door of his mother's compact mini-van when she swerved to avoid hitting a deer. She lost control of the vehicle and it rolled over in November on Route 24 in Taunton.


  • Five Dartmouth students and a school bus driver were injured in October of last year when a deer crashed into the front of the school bus on Chase Road. The crash began when a car first struck a deer and the animal was then thrown through the windshield of the school bus.


  The bus driver suffered injuries to his hand when the deer landed in his lap. The driver was commended for putting his own injuries aside and getting the 34 students safely off the bus.


  • A good Samaritan was struck and killed by a vehicle in November of last year when he assisted a disabled motorist whose car struck a deer on Interstate 495 in Raynham.


  Not only are these accidents potentially life-threatening and damaging to vehicles, they are also expensive to repair, according to local auto body shops.


  Wayne Pereira, manager of Fall River Auto Body, said the extent of the damage is often determined by how fast the vehicle was going, the size of the deer and whether the deer was hit "full-on" with the front of the vehicle.


  He said he has seen deer strikes at daylight and late at night. "They're running out space to be," he said of the deer.


  Lech's Garage and Auto Body in New Bedford has seen "quite a few" vehicles damaged in deer strikes even though it is early in the season, said Christine Lech, the owner. The damage is usually to the front and the front corner of the vehicle, but sometimes it is confined to the side of the vehicle because the deer ran into the car.


  "It can add up to quite a few thousand dollars in some cases," she said.


  "People say that it (deer) came out of nowhere. They didn't even see it," she said. "A lot of time they didn't have any time to react."


  But deer aren't the only wildlife drivers need to be aware of. Wild turkeys are another.


  Lech said they repaired a vehicle in May or June that was damaged when it hit a turkey on Interstate 195 in the Mattapoisett area, while traveling to New Jersey.


  "The turkey went through the windshield on the passenger side. The windshield was shattered," she said.

If you're struggling to make ends meet during the pandemic, debt consolidation could lower your monthly payments. And these days, mortgage rates are extremely low, so doing a cash-out refinance may be more affordable. Also, a lot of homes have risen in value lately due to the state of the housing market, so you may find it easier to squeeze equity out of your property right now. Finally, a home equity loan doesn't hinge on you having good credit, so even if your score needs work, it's still an option.

The Kansas Board of Regents has appointed Wichita State University's provost Richard Muma to serve as interim president of the university following former president Jay Golden's sudden resignation two weeks ago.


   


  "Dr. Muma possesses a wealth of experience and a deep knowledge of Wichita State," Regents chair Bill Feuerborn said in a release. "His leadership as acting president on two separate occasions has been invaluable to the university. The Regents are grateful he is willing to continue to serve as interim president."


   


  Before becoming WSU's provost in 2018, Muma served as the university's senior associate vice president for academic affairs and strategic enrollment management, as well as a professor and chair in the Departments of Public Health Sciences and Physician Assistant.


   


  Muma replaces Golden, who resigned suddenly in late September without explanation. Golden had come under fire over the summer after following student demands that he cancel a virtual speech from Ivanka Trump. Although calls mounted on the Regents to fire Golden for cancelling the speech, the Regents met in executive session but took no action on Golden's employment in the summer.


   


  Golden, who had served as president for less than a year, will continue to receive at least $225,000 for consulting services through June 2021, the Wichita Eagle reported.

“I guess, as Frank Sinatra would say, I did it my way,” James said earlier in these playoffs.


  That’s not up for debate.


  He’s got four titles. He’s a four-time NBA Finals MVP, the second to win that many. He’s done it all with the NBA’s biggest target on his back, with every action and every word scrutinized and often criticized.


  James has become the epitome of the independent superstar athlete, something many try to be but few even have a chance of pulling off. He does whatever he wants, whenever he wants, however he wants and makes it work. Bill Russell will forever have more rings and Michael Jordan will forever be the choice of many as the NBA’s greatest player. And that’s OK with James, who has forged his own path.


  “The game of basketball will pass me by,” James said as the title loomed. “There will be a new group of young kids and vets and rookies throughout the course of this game. So, I can’t worry about that as far as on the floor. How I move, how I walk, what I preach, what I talk about, how I inspire the next generation is what matters to me the most.”


  He’s never forgotten that he was once a broke kid from Akron, Ohio. If he’s not a billionaire yet, he’s trending that way. He’s on a Wheaties box now, saying its unveiling last week was “one of the best moments of my life.” He founded a school and stays involved with matters there. He’s actively trying to get more people, particularly Black people, to vote than ever before.


  Oh, if that wasn’t enough, he delivered a championship to a Lakers franchise that went 10 years without one and did so in a year when they needed it most, letting them cry tears of joy after all the tears of anguish that followed the death of Kobe Bryant in a helicopter crash on January 26.


  “I think it’s remarkable what LeBron is still doing at his age,” Denver coach Michael Malone said of James. “The minutes he’s playing, how effective he is on both ends of the floor, and the impact he has on both ends of the floor, his will to win is just incredible.”


  The 35-year-old James finished this postseason with 580 points; no one at his age had ever done that. He had 184 assists; no one at his age had ever done that. If he’s slowing down, he’s not showing it; he had 32 points in his first playoff game 14 years ago, he exceeded that six times in this postseason run.


  “He’s shown why he is the player that he is, why he’s had the career and the legacy that he’s continually building,” Miami’s Jimmy Butler said.


  James is 4,148 points behind Kareem Abdul-Jabbar for the regular-season scoring lead, meaning he’ll have to play at least two more full seasons to reach that mark. Sunday was his 260th career playoff appearance, passing Derek Fisher for the all-time record. He was All-NBA for the 16th time this season, a record. He started his 16th consecutive All-Star Game this season, yet another record. More fans picked him as MVP this season than Giannis Antetokounmpo, who won the award.


  There’s nothing left to prove on the basketball court.


  Then again, there’s been nothing left to prove for a while now.


  “I think the story will be told how it’s supposed to be told and be written how it’s supposed to be written,” James said. “But I don’t live my life thinking about legacy. What I do off the floor is what means more to me than what I do on the floor.”


  What he’s done, on and off the floor, is how legends are defined.


  “I just think it is a true testament to his greatness to be able to sustain this type of success year in, year out,” Miami coach Erik Spoelstra said. “Different uniforms. New players and new teams going after him. It’s a real testament to that commitment. He’s seen everything. At this point in his career, it’s just about winning.”


  Others have won more. But nobody in the NBA has won the way James has.


  His way.

It’s been five years since Northeast Ohio saxophonist Chris Coles first publicly workshopped what would become his multi-movement suite, “Nine Live Project,” in front of an audience at the Bop Stop. The piece originated as a tone poem, in which Coles put himself in the shoes of a churchgoer who witnessed the 2015 shooting that claimed the lives of nine Black members of the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, S.C.


  In 2017, Coles was awarded a Knight Arts Challenge grant for “Nine Lives Project” and received $45,000 to start conversations on racial inequality and immerse the audience in the story behind the original work. He raised another $40,000 to turn the poem into a 40-minute performance piece.


  Coles spoke with WKSU’s Amanda Rabinowitz in 2019 about the origins of the project, which was intended to heighten awareness of ongoing racial injustice in America after the Charleston shooting.


  More than a year later, Coles and a team of musicians and artists have completed the project and recorded its four movements. Coles said the work has taken on a new meaning in light of the racial unrest and increased support for the Black Lives Matter movement in 2020. Now, he said, his work celebrates the achievements and greatness of Black Americans, rather than solely mourning the nine Black lives lost.

One small-town Florida seller told me, speaking of his regular clientele, that because of government’s “taking away of our rights with coronavirus, _people are pissed_. I think right now is time for lawyers, not bullets, whereas I think most people are thinking it’s time for bullets.”
 Some gun sellers had hopes that the layered crises of 2020 would blow over, as has happened during tumultuous times in the past, but pessimism was palpable in most of my conversations.
 Eight months since it began, the surge in gun sales has cooled somewhat, but the pending election still looms large. In September, background checks dropped back below 3 million but not by much. And in the long term, the new gun owners of 2020 may or may not transform gun culture.
 The National Rifle Assn. claims that even if the buyers didn’t start this way, they’ll be converts to 2nd Amendment politics, but the sellers’ perception that a good many of the 2020 buyers are reluctant gun owners may well be more accurate — they are liberals whose politics aren’t going to fundamentally change. Nor are they likely to turn into enthusiasts for whom guns are everyday life.

Recruiting pollworkers is more than a numbers game. Ohio law requires that members of a single party make up no more than half the workers at each precinct. So, for example, Democratic Cuyahoga County is shopping for 1,000 more Republicans and Independents, while small Republican counties like Monroe need a couple dozen Democrats and Independents.


  Then, for every function at every precinct, people of differing parties are paired, from curbside voting to delivering precinct results at the end of the day.


  All of which LeeAnn Slicker found reassuring after she signed up for the first time to be a pollworker in Stark County. Slicker works full time and the two youngest of her five children are still living at home, so she hasn’t had the time nor, until recently, a special inclination to be active politically. But she says this election is different.


  “It’s a scary time for all of us," Slicker said. "I have three older daughters and two younger children that I’m concerned about, where things are heading for them. And I feel like I have to do something, some little bit to help out.”


  With more than 8 million Ohioans registered to vote and as much as half expected to wait for Election Day to cast their ballots, Ohio’s still looking for a little bit more of that help.

Alabama coach Nick Saban and athletic director Greg Byrne have tested positive for COVID-19, three days before the second-ranked Crimson Tide is set to face No. 3 Georgia in a clash of Southeastern Conference and national powers.


  Both said their tests Wednesday morning came back positive, but Saban said he didn't have any symptoms by late afternoon.


  “I immediately left work and isolated at home,” Saban said.


  The second-ranked Crimson Tide is set to face No. 3 Georgia on Saturday, and may be without their iconic 68-year-old coach who remained scheduled to talk with the media Wednesday evening.


  Saban said he informed the team via a Zoom session at 2 p.m. Wednesday and that offensive coordinator Steve Sarkisian will oversee game preparations while he works from home.


  Sarkisian is a former head coach at Washington and USC. Saban has led Alabama to five national titles since taking over the program in 2007, and also won one at LSU.


  It was another body blow for the SEC, which had postponed two games this week already: No. 10 Florida against defending national champion LSU and Missouri- Vanderbilt.


  Alabama's head trainer Jeff Allen and medical director Jimmy Robinson said in a joint statement that Saban and Byrne were the only initial positive tests.


  “All individuals who are considered high risk contacts have been notified and will follow quarantine guidelines,” the statement said. "We will follow the SEC’s Return to Activity and Medical Guidance Task Force Protocol for testing asymptomatic positives.”


  Byrne said he would “remain at home and follow all guidelines.”


  "We’ve been diligent about mask wearing and social distancing from the start and want to continue to encourage you all to take the necessary precautions to help stop the spread of this virus for yourself and those around you,” the 48-year-old AD said.

As Kansas school districts finish up the first quarters of the school year, officials need to start thinking about operations beyond the short term, education commissioner Randy Watson told the Kansas State Board of Education on Wednesday morning.


   


  And as districts struggle to balance the needs of parents, who might rely on schools for child care, and the needs of teachers, who want to feel safe in their work environments, Watson said there is no reason those should be competing interests.


   


  Watson gave the board an update on how Kansas schools have been working to meet the needs of their communities over the past two months. Echoing remarks he had previously made to other education groups, Watson said district officials have been conditioned to focus on their schools' immediate needs, and current teaching environments are sustainable for the entire school year.


   


  He said that virtually none of the state's school districts have followed the Kansas State Department of Education's gating criteria -- which sets benchmarks for when to move between in-person, hybrid and remote learning environments -- to the letter. That is alright, Watson said, because the department's gating criteria document was only meant to be guidance, with specific details left to local districts.


   


  However, problems are arising when districts continually adjust their gating criteria and operations over short periods of time, and Watson said local school officials are pressured to react to immediate changes in their communities' COVID-19 situations.


   


  "That thinking, I think, has hampered our long-term look at this for the rest of the school year," he said. "I've been encouraging school districts to look at this over the long term, because we need to take care of several what look to be competing needs. And they're not."


   


  He said that way of thinking isn't necessarily anyone's fault, but school success will require a shift in thinking.


   


  Historically, teachers have viewed schools primarily as being education delivery systems, he said. In contrast, parents have come to also know schools as places where their children could receive care and supervision while they are at work.


   


  "(Parents) look at it as both, and when that gets disrupted for a long time, the tension starts to happen when parents say, 'I can't do this, and my kids aren't learning as well.' The teachers are saying, 'I can't do this, and kids aren't learning as well.' "


   


  Schools should look for ways to open for in-person learning, but they have to think carefully about how to do that, Watson said, and that process may be easier and quicker for some districts compared to others. Smaller districts may be better able to spread students out in classrooms, but they are also hampered by smaller pools of staff and resources.


   


  Key to any reopening plans, though, is keeping students socially distanced, cohorting and requiring masks in schools, Watson said, as well as making intentional, more permanent operational changes.


   


  "What's happening, in many districts, is that they're just getting whiplashed," he said. "They're in constant turmoil, and you see this playing out. In board meeting to board meeting, decision to decision, lawsuit being filed to lawsuit -- when you're in that constant cycle, it makes long-term planning hard."


   


  In making any long-term planning, Watson suggested schools take a break from constant changes in learning environments and bring teachers, parents and other communities together to talk about each group's interests, which don't necessarily have to compete.


   


  Board members noted that they have seen a lot of tension and division in their communities over decisions about school learning environments. District 1 board member Janet Waugh, of Kansas City, Kan., said schools can only do so much to protect their students when their communities aren't taking basic COVID-19 precautions.


   


  "The schools are doing it right," she said. "I really have nothing but the greatest praise for our schools, but some of our communities, quite frankly, are not doing it right."


   


  District 7 board member Ben Jones, of Sterling, said schools have had to deal with increasingly hostile communities, no matter what direction they take on reopening schools or keeping them closed.


   


  "Even though the community means well and the parents mean well, it's not coming across as, 'Well, we still love you.' It's come across as, 'How dare you?' " he said. "I've dealt with it from both sides. I've had parents who think the virus is a figment of the imagination, that this virus doesn't exist or that it's made up, but I've dealt with parents that go, 'How dare you make my kid go to school?' "


   


  The board instructed Watson to investigate ways the state department could lighten local school officials' workloads, possibly by loosening district report requirements or waiving or changing the 1,116-hour minimum on yearly instruction time.


   


  The board also met, via Zoom, with Kansas' regional teachers of the year, including Tabatha Rosproy, who was both the Kansas and National Teacher of the Year recipient this year. The teachers shared updates on what they have seen in their schools as teachers and families adapt to the pandemic.


   


  Amy Hillman, a regional teacher of the year from Olathe USD 233, borrowed an analogy from one of her students. This year has been like a rose, she said -- riddled with thorny challenges but also buds of hope and opportunity.


   


  "There's always hope," she said. "There's hope in the darkest moments. There's hope in the most divisive moments. There's even hope in the most quiet of moments."


   


  The teachers said that some of the biggest challenges they have seen are coping with sudden changes between learning formats, the added workloads of teaching remote and in-person classes, and mental health.


   


  Although she is on sabbatical this year as she tours the country speaking on education issues, Rosproy said, adjusting to teaching for other educators has been like fitting a tent back into its bag.


   


  "You try punching it and rolling it, but it won't go in like it was supposed to," she said. "That's what we're facing with education right now. We're trying to make remote learning and hybrid learning too much like it was in the classroom."


   


  The teachers said that instead of looking to poorly imitate the in-classroom learning experience, schools should look to established institutions like virtual schools that have been doing remote, online learning since before the pandemic.


   


  "It's going to look different when we're two-dimensional on these computers," Hillman said. "But the fact is, man, our teachers are doing it. They're bringing their best selves, and we have to believe that."


   


  The Kansas Teacher of the Year team challenged the board to act on three initiatives they had identified as keys for supporting teachers:


   


  • Back up equity initiatives. The pandemic has only magnified existing inequalities in Kansas schools, and those extend beyond lack of internet and technology access, Rosproy said.


   


  • Value educators and school staff as much as frontline pandemic workers. Rosproy said teachers need to have spaces they feel safe to work in, and frequent COVID-19 testing in schools would help toward that goal.


   


  • Boost funding for mental health counseling and services for students and staff. Schools will likely have to deal with the mental and emotional traumas of COVID-19 even after the pandemic is over, Rosproy said.

“President Trump is absolutely right: mass voting by mail is a recipe for chaos, confusion and disenfranchisement,” McDonald said in an email to Reuters. “In a free, fair election, President Trump wins hands down.”


  McDonald said allegations that Trump might not accept the election results were Democratic “conspiracy theories.”


  Biden and his running mate, U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris, have repeatedly urged people to vote early. During their recent debates with Trump and Vice President Mike Pence, respectively, both steered clear of talking about Trump’s unfounded claims of a rigged election.


  “Vote, vote, vote!,” Biden told Americans during his Sept. 29 debate with Trump, when the moderator asked the candidates to reassure Americans about the integrity of the election. “If we get the votes, it’s going to be all over. He’s going to go. He can’t stay in power.”

“We’ve had a history of players coming back injured from national team scenarios, but what they do with the data is with the national team.”


  Kim Little may be available for Sunday but the others won’t be quite ready until after the international break and Montemurro wants to get to the bottom of why the injuries are happening so frequently.


  He went on to say: “Is it load management? Possibly. Is it the accumulation of games? Possibly. Is it the long pause of games and now, suddenly, there are lots of games and there is the stress of real-game situations as opposed to training at home alone? Possibly”.


  “We’re trying to work out where and how and why this has happened. We need to be better at understanding all of this. There is no finger pointing here, this is about us coming together as a group, as a wider Arsenal, and also how we work with individuals on a specific basis and looking at how we can get better results.


  “We need to look at it and be better because it’s an area where we are a little bit concerned.”


  “That is despite a lot of extra precautions taken this season by the club, off the back of such a long break without football, too.


  “There’s been more in terms of the screening and nutrition and the understanding of where they’re at. We’ve done a lot in terms of the mental health and the psychology areas those two areas are non-negotiables for us.


  “I do have a feeling that professional athletes being out of the game for six months, in terms of the impact, in terms of the moment, the decision making, the different scenarios in terms of football pressure and football environments as opposed to isolated training, has taken its toll.


  “One of the things we’ve tried to do from day one was to simulate and integrate real football situations as much as we could. A football moment is different to replicating it in training and replicating it on your own at home.


  “The turns are different, the ball travels differently, the grass is different, the pressure is different, so we’d just try to replicate that as much as we can, but I think the long period out doing those football actions I think has taken its toll.”


  Arsenal expect to have a full and available squad for the Manchester United game after the International break.

A rescue plan for South Africa's flag carrier has yet to get off the ground since the government has not provided promised funding, with the upcoming budget looming as a crucial test for its future.


  State-owned South African Airways (SAA) had limped along for a decade thanks to regular government bailouts but last December Pretoria decided to let it sink into adminstration in the hopes of a profound restructuring to stanch the flow of red ink and wipe away debts.


  Administrators axed most domestic and some international routes in February to save cash -- even before coronavirus grounded airlines globally -- as they drafted a massive restructuring plan to create a leaner, competitive airline.


  Creditors in July gave the green light even though they will be paid only 7.5 cents for each rand they are owed.


  The plan would see the airline shrink dramatically, emerging with a fleet of just six aircraft out of the 44 it had last year. Only a fifth of the almost 5,000 employees would remain.


  The aim is then to grow it back to 26 planes by the end of 2021 and re-hire 1,000 furloughed staff.


  The plan requires five billion rand ($302 million) to kick-start and another 5.3 billion rand over three years, which the government has pledged to finance, as well as bringing in a well-heeled strategic partner.


  \- Creditors 'restless' -


  But the money has yet to materialise.


  Finance Minister Tito Mboweni is expected to announce details of the funding when he presents his medium-term budget at the end of October.


  Analysts warn that failure to move ahead quickly could sink the restructuring plan.


  Market researcher Peter Attard Montalto, of South African firm Intellidex, said creditors are growing "restless" and risked voting for liquidation at their next meeting with administrators, a date for which is not yet set.


  "They are increasingly assuming they will never get any money," he said.


  While the administrators believe the restructuring plan is still viable -- if the money comes soon -- they have also evoked more severe solutions.


  \- Winding down? -


  "The plan is looking good in terms of what we needed to set up to orchestrate it," the administrators' spokeswoman Louise Brugman told AFP. "Now we need the money."


  Administrators have suggested winding down the airline as an alternative -- stripping the company to the bare bones but keeping its licenses, allowing the airline to fly again if the opportunity arises.


  That would still require an injection of more than four billion rand.


  The government has resisted this option as well as the airline's complete liquidation.


  The Department of Public Enterprises did not reply to AFP's request for comment, but its director general Kgathatso Tlhakudi told local television network Newzroom Afrika on Monday that three possible strategic partners for SAA had been shortlisted.


  "Provisionally there are... three strong entities," including two international ones, he said.


  It is not clear if these include Ethiopian Airlines.


  Africa's largest carrier has offered to help SAA start afresh by providing planes, technical services and management assistance, but said it will not take a stake, and thus will not help finance its rescue.


  \- Doubts airline will succeed -


  Analysts also question whether the overhaul -- if it goes through -- will be enough to save the carrier, particularly considering the impact of coronavirus on global air travel.


  "The plan is too much of a status quo," Montalto said.


  "It is not really targeted to plug a gap in the market. I think it will require another bailout in two or three years' time," he predicted.


  Aviation expert Linden Birns worries about the impact of creditors having been burned by the restructuring.


  "A lot of those are companies that would have traditionally done business with the airline," he noted. "Now they will think twice before granting generous credit terms or discounts."


  That will make it difficult for the new SAA to succeed.


  Birns said it is becoming increasingly hard to even justify SAA's existence.


  "They seem to be quite dogmatic about rescuing the airline... I can only guess there are political imperatives at play," he said, deploring the job losses.

Facebook shut down the page of a fringe New Zealand political party on Thursday, days before a general election, for sharing what the company called misinformation about the novel coronavirus pandemic.


  The newly formed Advance NZ Party's page was taken off because of “repeated violations” of Facebook's policy on misinformation about the virus that could lead to imminent physical harm, Facebook said in a statement.


  “We have clear policies against this type of content and will enforce on these policies regardless of anyone’s political position or party affiliation,” it said.


  Advance NZ said Facebook's action was “election interference”.


  This is a cynical example of election interference by an American-owned social media outlet that has no business performing any such operation in our sovereign nation,” party co-leader Billy Te Kahika said in a statement.


  The party has stirred controversy with an anti-vaccination stance and has also called for an end to coronavirus lockdowns. It has said the case fatality rate of the virus is “not unlike that of seasonal influenza”.


  Advance NZ is seen getting about 1% of the vote, according to the latest opinion poll, which would mean it will have no impact on the election outcome.


  Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, who also leads the and Labour Party, is seeking a second term in the October 17 polls on the back of her success in eliminating the coronavirus in the country of 5 million with lockdowns and social distancing.


  On Tuesday, Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters ridiculed a question from another coronavirus sceptic at an election campaign event.


  Peters, the leader of the New Zealand First party, was answering questions when an unidentified man asked “where is your evidence that there is a virus that causes this disease?”


  “Here's someone who gets up and says 'the Earth is flat',” Peters responded. “Sorry sunshine, wrong place.”


  Peters was a kingmaker in the previous election, siding with Ardern to form a coalition government.

Now, with Biden leading preference polls nationally and in crucial battleground states in his own bid for the White House, activists on the left are poised, if he’s elected, to be more aggressive from the start in pressing their agenda. They talk of a strategy that combines insider politicking with outside agitation — the sort of demonstrations by fast food workers, Walmart employees and Los Angeles port truck drivers that brought pressure to bear on the Obama-Biden administration by its second term.
 Within a Biden administration’s first 100 days, Geevarghese said, there would need to be a “mass mobilization” of progressives: “There is not going to be a honeymoon period.”
 His words reflect the impatience of the political left, which for months has stifled its demands of the Biden campaign to make common cause with it in defeating President Trump. Its favored candidate, independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, himself _endorsed Biden_ months ago, and members of the Sanders bloc have _collaborated with Biden’s campaign_ in “unity task forces.” But they say they’re not letting him off the hook past the election.
 “Bernie has been very clear that after the election ... we’re going to hold Biden’s feet to the fire on his progressive commitments that he has made,” said Faiz Shakir, a senior advisor to Sanders. For example, he said, Biden “has made some pretty solid commitments” on climate policy, including to invest in clean energy and green public housing.

  In the book, Cruz discusses the need to reelect Donald J. Trump to protect our Christian heritage, the Catholic Church, and put the brakes on the forcing of a Catholic nun group to pay for forced illegal abortions!


  For anyone interested in the subject, I would suggest getting the book ”One Vote Away” by Cruz.

More than $2 million out of $50 million to be awarded to support Pennsylvania fire, rescue and EMS companies will be coming to Schuylkill County, a “blessing” in light of reduced fundraising during the COVID-19 pandemic.


  Gov. Tom Wolf announced the Office of the State Fire Commissioner will be awarding grant money to offset expenses emergency personnel incurred due to the pandemic.


  In Schuylkill County, 89 volunteer fire companies and 11 EMS units will receive $2,182,183 through the CARES Act.


  Frank Zangari Jr., Girardville fire chief and president of the Schuylkill County Fire Chiefs Association, called the money a tremendous asset to first responders across the state and, in particular, Schuylkill County.


  “Fundraising was almost impossible with the COVID-19 restrictions,” he said “That took away from our volunteer fire companies.”


  Zangari said every organization that applied was awarded grant money that can be used to maintain vehicles or do things like purchase tires, something they may not have been able to do.


  “This takes away a risk factor since companies can use this money to operate their equipment more safely and effectively,” Zangari said.


  “This is truly a blessing for Schuylkill County,” he added.


  Receiving the highest grant amounts were McAdoo Fire Company, $48,342; Minersville Fire Rescue, $36,705; Hegins Valley Fire and Rescue, $35,199 and Shenandoah Community Ambulance Association, $33,428.


  Other grants awarded were between $5,000 and $26,000.


  Wolf said the money is well deserved since fire, rescue and EMS personnel are often on the front lines of the COVID-19 pandemic.


  “All these professionals, some working as volunteers, give selflessly to support neighbors and communities,” the governor said in a news release. “These CARES Act grants can assist in supporting them and their ongoing efforts to keep their neighbors and communities protected and safe.”


  The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act was passed by Congress with overwhelming bipartisan support and signed into law by President Donald Trump on March 27.


  The more than $2 trillion economic relief package was designed to provide fast and direct economic assistance for American workers, families and small businesses and to preserve jobs for industries throughout the United States.


  Bruce Trego, state fire commissioner, echoed the words of Wolf.


  “Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, our office has remained open to provide the necessary resources that our fire service and EMS personnel need to fulfill a critical public safety role throughout the commonwealth,” he said. “Departments have been exceptionally patient during this process, as our office has worked through changing federal guidance dictating how these dollars can be spent.”


  Of the $50 million set aside for the new program, $44 million will be made available to fire and rescue companies and the remaining $6 million will go to EMS companies.


  The money can only be used for operation and equipment expenses that can include utilities, insurance, apparatus repairs and fuel, lost revenue due to pandemic restrictions and expenses for cleaning, sanitizing and disinfecting equipment and property or other expenses incurred to prevent the spread of communicable diseases.


  Program funds must be used for eligible expenses initiated on or after March 6 and completed on or before Dec. 30 to be considered as eligible.


  Grant recipients should expect to receive further communication from OSFC in the coming weeks, the commissioner said.

“He’s at a new school. He has a new teacher, new everything,” Garett said. “I was a little hesitant at first, but everyone is separated and they have to wear masks, so I was okay with that.”
 Meanwhile, at C.G. Bethel High School in North Miami Beach, 10th-grader Promise Saillant was full of concern and disbelief after his first day back.
 “Some kids didn’t wear their masks properly,” he said. “I don’t understand if there’s still a virus out there why they’re putting us back in school.”
 From safety concerns to logistical issues, many would describe the transition back to classrooms as anything but smooth.
 School officials claimed that safeguards against the spread of COVID-19 would include socially distanced classrooms, frequent cleaning of facilities and wearing masks on campus. However, schools experienced varying degrees of success making sure these measures were enforced, which left some feeling safe and others full of anxiety.
 Indeed, there have been multiple reports of unequal enforcement across the district, and according to the M-DCPS’ COVID-19 dashboard at least eight students and one teacher have already tested positive for the coronavirus.
 These instances seem to be isolated, and those in contact with the infected students have been instructed to quarantine.
 Tenth-grader Saillant complained that the collaborative environment he’s used to in the classroom is gone because of social distancing. Most of his work is still being done online, and he’s compromising his safety to be in a classroom for “no reason,” he said.
 “I prefer online school more than physical,” Saillant added, “because we still have to be on a computer for eight hours when we were already doing that at home.”
 At Richmond Heights Middle School instructors must teach online and in-person classes simultaneously, according to 12-year-old student Kai Jones.
 He told his mother, Randa Porter, that his teachers’ attention is split, and they often forget about students who are attending remotely.
 “There just aren’t enough teachers,” Porter said. “You have one teacher trying to concentrate and do multiple things, back and forth. I don't think it’s doable at all.”
 Despite the issues at other institutions, students at Monsignor Edward Pace High School in Miami Gardens have “adjusted beautifully,” to the schoolhouse model, according to principal Ana Garcia.
 In addition to a mask mandate and social distancing, the staff conducts daily wellness surveys and temperature checks. Many students at the school, including 18-year-old senior Gabriela Padilla, also described the transition as an easy one. She said she felt very safe on campus.
 Students at North Miami Senior High gave mixed reviews to the return. The effects of the pandemic could be felt throughout the school halls. Senior Abigail Gelin said the first week wasn't bad, but the new dynamic will take some getting used to.
 “Staff were present in every hallway and consistently ordering us to stay distant,” she said. “We also have to social distance at lunch, which is probably the hardest since there usually isn’t so much space in the lunch line.”
 But, overall, she said she felt comfortable on campus. Her only complaint was that one of her teachers took off their mask during class, and had the students sit further away.
 “They couldn't handle teaching all day with a mask on,” said Gelin.
 Another student, sophomore Jonathan Nazien, had a very different experience. He said that now school is easier and less stressful. He feels protected by his teachers and administration.
 “Hand sanitizer is provided everywhere you go,” he said. “I see janitors cleaning, new janitors’ faces around the school, and everything is wiped and mopped down around the clock.”
 Payton Wilson, who’s also a sophomore, said his first day back at school was great.
 “It [was] harder to focus online,” he said, “because the teachers couldn’t tell if we were listening or paying attention.”

"This year you’re going to have to be really competitive early on if you’re coming to the race looking for a podium or high GC result. There’s the Tourmalet on stage six and already a couple of hilltop finishes before that. It is a hard edition and clearly one of the big challenges we are going to face is the weather with the race being all in the North of Spain at this time of year, particularly some of the stages up in Asturias and the stage up to l’Angliru.


  "In general, we will be looking to maximise the opportunities with the potential we’ve got in our team line-up. We’ve got some young blood in the team with Scotson and Stannard who will hopefully be the future of our team, and so it will be good to help them get through their first ever Grand Tour."


  Chaves finished third in the Vuelta a España back in 2016 but has struggled to match that level in recent times. A virus hit him hard in 2018 and, although he has shown flashes of his old self, he has yet to mount a GC bid of his own over three weeks in the last few years. He came through the Tour de France a few weeks ago, however, and is still relatively fresh.


  The 30-year-old Colombian finished 23rd in Paris and tried to make it into several breaks. He also offered support to Adam Yates as the British rider fought for a top-ten and the Colombian is relishing the chance to have more space in the Vuelta.


  "This year, because of the timing of the race and the circumstances, like everyone, I feel a bit weird, but I feel like I am arriving in good condition especially after the Tour and World Championships," Chaves said.

These and other forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future results and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in forward- looking statements, including, as a result of factors, risks and uncertainties over which we have no control. The inclusion of such statements should not be regarded as a representation that any plans, estimates or expectations will be achieved. You should not place undue reliance on such statements. Important factors, risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from such plans, estimates or expectations include, but are not limited to, the following: (i) the effect of any announcement or event relating to the pendency of the merger, including the potential impact on Tiffany's business relationships, operating results, and business generally; (ii) risks relating to the merger and litigation relating to the merger as previously disclosed in Tiffany's SEC filings; (iii) the amount and timing of the costs, fees, expenses and other charges related to the merger, including in the event of any unexpected delays and in light of the pending merger- related litigation; (iv) any adverse effects on Tiffany by other general industry, economic, business and/or competitive factors; (v) the COVID-19 pandemic, including the duration and scope thereof, the availability of a vaccine or cure that mitigates the effect of the virus, the potential for additional waves of outbreaks and changes in financial, business, travel and tourism, consumer discretionary spending and other general consumer behaviors, political, public health and other conditions, circumstances, requirements and practices resulting therefrom; (vi) protest activity in the U.S.; and (vii) such other factors as are set forth in Tiffany's periodic public filings with the SEC, including but not limited to those described under the headings "Risk Factors" and "Forward Looking Statements" in its most recently filed Form 8-K dated September 28, 2020, its Form 10-Q for the quarter ended July 31, 2020, its Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020, the definitive proxy statement on Schedule 14A, filed with the SEC on January 6, 2020, and in its other filings made with the SEC from time to time, which are available via the SEC's website at www.sec.gov. Consequences of material differences in results as compared with those anticipated in the forward-looking statements could include, among other things, business disruption, operational problems, financial loss, legal liability to third parties and similar risks, any of which could have a material adverse effect on Tiffany's financial condition, results of operations, credit rating, liquidity or stock price. In addition, there can be no assurance that the merger will be completed, or if it is completed, that it will close in the timeframe previously anticipated, or that the expected benefits of the merger will be realized. Because Tiffany does not know when, or if, the merger will be completed, Tiffany has not included certain costs related to the closing of the merger, such as advisor fees, litigation-related expenses, and expenses related to the acceleration of equity pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, in its financial forecasts for the remainder of the fiscal year ending January 31, 2021 or any future period. These expenses are expected to be significant, although the vast majority of these costs will only be incurred if and when the merger is ultimately completed.
