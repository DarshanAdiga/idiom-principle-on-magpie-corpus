Lee Wallace marked his 350th career appearance with the opening goal
 It might have taken Rangers 19 minutes to open the scoring, Kenny Miller playing in Wallace who put his shot through Jamie Sneddon's legs, but the home team's dominance was obvious long before then.
 At times, it was akin to a training session instead of a cup tie. The forwards-versus-defence vibe carried on for the vast part of the day. When McKay drove at the Cowdenbeath defence, who conveniently backed off him, and slammed home Rangers' second, the game was done.
 There was respite for Cowdenbeath but, though beautiful, it was all too brief. Brett's free-kick was perfectly executed, up and over the wall and into the net via the underside of Wes Foderingham's crossbar.
 At 2-1, the game was, in theory, alive but the reality was Rangers had extra gears and they did not take long in finding them. Miller had a shot hoofed off the line at the beginning of the second half, then Waghorn had an effort tipped away by Sneddon.
 Rangers had upped the pace and the goals soon came. A nice flick from Gedion Zelalem, some good strength from Waghorn and weak defending from Cowdenbeath saw the striker thump home the third three minutes into the new half.

But Grimsby - playing in the play-offs for a fourth consecutive year - struck a late third through Nathan Arnold.
 Paul Hurst's side, who lost to Bristol Rovers on penalties in last year's final, had seen Arnold's long-range strike tipped onto the post shortly before taking the lead at Wembley.
 Bogle then glanced in Jon Nolan's free-kick via Rovers' Darren Carter's back to open the scoring, before volleying in from six yards on the rebound to double Grimsby's lead just one minute later.
 Forest Green introduced substitute Parkin at half-time and the 34-year-old former Preston striker's presence changed the game.
 Parkin could only hit the side netting from Forest Green's best chance, inside the six-yard box, before Marsh-Brown's sweet, dipping strike gave them hope.
 But Forest Green, who had finished nine points above Grimsby in the league table, could not find an equaliser despite a spirited fightback.
 Rovers, who sacked manager Ady Pennock one week before the start of their semi-final against Dover to "boost their chances in the play-offs", had set a fifth-tier record of nine consecutive wins to start the season, before being beaten to the league title by Cheltenham Town.
 Having finished in their highest-ever league position in second, they were led at Wembley by caretaker boss Scott Bartlett, while next season's manager, Mark Cooper, offered guidance from the dugout.
 But the Nailsworth club - who had hoped to make their home town the smallest settlement to ever host a Football League club - saw their promotion hopes dashed in the play-offs for the second year running.
 Arnold, who had a low shot saved with 15 minutes to play, completed the win in stoppage time, tucking in on the rebound to end Forest Green's hopes of a late twist.
 The promoted Mariners return to Wembley on 22 May for the FA Trophy final against FC Halifax.
