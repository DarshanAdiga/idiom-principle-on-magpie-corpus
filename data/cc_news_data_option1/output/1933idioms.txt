Sports fans around the world have teams they follow, but they also bet on teams they have no allegiance to as a form of entertainment.


  That ranges from single bets, to accumulators and from final game results, to the number of corners or fouls committed.


  This is especially the case with young men in their twenties who will often put small bets on games as part of the sports package.


  Two teams in a league you may never have heard of will be playing, but you will get so into the game once you place a bet, because it’s in your nature to want to win.


  People take pride in their betting accomplishments and will do their research in order to see how they should place a bet, including a team’s recent form in the last ten games for example.

They had to be realistic about the hegemonic strength of Spanish neoliberalism and the gap between what was being said in the streets and squares about the struggles of everyday life and what was making it into the mainstream media. Much has been made of the indignados’ exploration of digital democracy (they have used such platforms as Reddit to discuss policy proposals, and the online forum Plaza Podemos to vote on them), but Iglesias makes it clear that he believes TV remains ‘the great medium of our time’, the primary place for challenging establishment narratives and language. ‘When our adversaries use terms like la casta, revolving door, the “Berlusconisation” of politics, eviction, precarity,’ he writes, ‘they’re acknowledging the displacement of the fight onto a terrain that favours us.’

Winning on enemy terrain also meant breaking what Errejón, now Podemos’s political secretary, has called the left’s ‘leadership taboo’, the idea prevalent among the indignados that ‘a charismatic leader is incompatible with real democracy.’ Errejón ran last year’s European election campaign and – to the discontent of some – put a photo of Iglesias’s face on the ballot, reasoning that in those early months his regular appearances on political talkshows to put the case against austerity had made Podemos and ‘Pablo’ indistinguishable. In an election with so many undecided voters, it might make the difference.

Often, it takes a national crisis to expose the systemic flaws of society's most trusted systems. We have seen the nation's food supply chain collapse as a result of this pandemic, but it has really exposed more about the American psychology about agriculture and what eat or, more, want to eat.
 Americans suffer from the most costly and greatest occurrence of the major leading causes of death than any other nation on the planet. We have high incidence of cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, obesity and these are all caused from a diet of affluence, or what is called the Western diet by T Colin Campbell, PhD, and Thomas M. Campbell II, M.D, authors of The China Study. Over decades of research and study of nutrition by these two scientists with rats and now human subjects, in conjunction with other physicians, they have found that the typical Western diet of animal protein, dairy products and sugar consumption has led to the failing health of Americans.
 Let's look at dairy products to start. Milk was frankly never meant for human consumption. The milk produced by the human mother contains approximately 5-6% protein, exactly the right amount for the new infant. This mother's milk contains the exact amount of macronutrients and has a 35% fat content, much higher that what is recommended once the infant reaches three years of age. This fat content is important because the infant is growing at enormous rates. Once weaned, children should not consume cow's milk. Why? Because cow's milk contains a cancer-causing protein called Casein, and it represents about 87% of the content of cow's milk.
 Consider cell replication. It is great to have healthy growth for our youth, but do we want healthy cell replication growth? Not really. Drinking cow's milk introduces this very protein into our bodies, and Campbell's decades worth research on rats indicated a direct correlation of introducing the Casein protein and cancer development.
 What about meat products? According to Dr. Caldwell B. Esselstyn Jr., M.D., the leading cause of heart disease in consuming animal protein. He says, "You graduate from high school in this country, you get a diploma and you also get the foundation for coronary heart disease," all based on the Western diet consumed by Americans.
 We like to blame this condition on genetics, but frankly, Esselstyn has improved and reversed heart disease by simply putting patients on a whole food plant based diet. Even those patients with multiple surgeries, stents and deemed the end of the line patients, with strict dietary changes, their coronary heart disease was reversed.
 So what does this say about how our government communicates to the public about what our dietary requirements should be? Not much. Even our medical community does not get much more than 25% nutritional education throughout their entire physician training. And, big corporations stack governmental boards with so called scientists designed to influence standards about what gets sold to the American public, thereby influencing farmers about what they should produce, or more likely what will be paid for.
 So large cereal companies advocate for higher sugar standards to the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) which is part of the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences and is responsible for reviewing and updating recommended consumption of individual nutrients. The American Dairy Association, one of the most influential lobbying organizations in government makes sure that school kids are assured of getting two containers of cow's milk daily. And if it looks like milk consumption is waning, they conduct expansive ad campaigns like "Got milk?"
 The Live Stock Association, also one of the most powerful lobby groups, makes sure the supply chains are full through its corporate farms (whether that be beef, pork, lamb, chicken or any other animal protein source) and if that is threatened, the president of the United States opens up that food chain by executive order. This agricultural structure and the substance of it is literally killing Americans through the manifestation of disease incidence.
 It is time to rethink our entire food system. We need small farms that feed PEOPLE, a more whole food plant based diet, better knowledge of what animal based protein and dairy is doing to the human body and better environment practices if we are going to succeed. This is something we will be forced to examine after this pandemic is over.

Major IT outsourcing contracts, which include software maintenance, cloud computing and analytics, are worth several hundreds of millions of dollars and typically stretch over many years.


  As well as some discounts and payment deferrals of typically between one to four months, the tech companies are in some cases offering to buy up computer data centers from their clients and the existing systems and hardware that are being replaced or upgraded at banks, the executives said.


  Accenture said it was working with banking clients to address the implications of the crisis but did not comment on pricing talks. Cognizant and Infosys also declined to comment on its talks with clients, while Tata Consultancy did not respond to a request for comment.


  JPMorgan, Bank of America and Citigroup declined to comment on their discussions with vendors.


  The negotiations are ongoing and no agreements have been struck yet as many leading banks have delayed finalizing their tech budgets due to the uncertainty caused by the coronavirus crisis, according to the sources.


  WIDER INDUSTRY TREND


  The proposals reflect a wider trend, about half a dozen of tech industry insiders told Reuters, with discounts of varying size and investment commitments featuring in many discussions between vendors and their financial industry customers.


  Research and advisory firm Gartner estimates the banking and financial services industry's spending globally on IT and information security will fall 5.6per cent in 2020 to US$502 billion.


  India's IT outsourcing sector, which includes the likes of Tata Consultancy and Infosys, is likely to be particularly hard hit. It has grown into a nearly US$200 billion a year industry over the past two decades, offering technology services to corporate heavyweights across the world.


  Developing and maintaining the plumbing of the world's financial services industry accounts for 40per cent of its revenues, with Wall Street banks among its biggest customers.


  The top 10 U.S. banks collectively spend roughly US$70 billion on technology annually, according to public statements and executives.


  Cognizant, IBM, and Infosys have all withdrawn their 2020 forecasts in recent weeks, citing concerns about pricing and budget cuts at their major clients. Accenture cut its full-year guidance in March, while Wipro withdrew its revenue forecast for the current quarter.


  "We've seen some delays in ... discretionary spending and select requests for furloughs, rate concessions and extended payment terms from our clients," Cognizant CEO Brian Humphries said in an earnings call this month.


  IBM and Wipro declined to comment on any pricing talks with clients. But IBM said its broad client base provided a measure of stability in terms of recurring revenues and profit in "these challenging times".


  SWEETNESS HAS LIMITS


  Banks are not, however, slashing tech spending as heavily as sectors such as travel, hospitality and retail. Many are also investing in technology that helps staff work from home.


  For instance, Standard Chartered, which typically spends about US$1 billion a year on technology, is preparing cuts in many areas, but also plans to invest in remote working tech, and wants to dedicate some of the money saved on travel to that, group chief information officer Michael Gorriz told Reuters.


  "What has happened with COVID-19 is that these plans have been rapidly accelerated," he said.


  For technology companies looking to keep customers on-side and weather the storm, there are limits, though.


  While vendors have little choice but to offer discounts to remain competitive, they are unlikely to go as far as to accept losses, said Ray Wang, founder of Silicon Valley technology research and advisory firm Constellation Research.


  "The discounting for client business will intensify as the number of contracts drop overall in the market," said Wang, but he added: "I don't think they will hurt their own margins for growth right now. Profitability is very important."

L’intervento è stato certificato in applicazione ai contenuti della circolare del Ministero della Salute 0005443 del 22 febbraio scorso. Sono stati impiegati disinfettanti classificati come PMC a base di complesso di Pentapotassio Bis (perossiddomonosolfato) bis (solfato), ipoclorito di sodio, perossido di idrogeno.   Le operazioni di sanificazione, che andranno ripetute con cadenza periodica, vanno ad aggiungersi ai metodi igienico-sanitari standard eseguiti da sempre in tutti i comparti aziendali. Mentre fin dai primi giorni della diffusione della pandemia i protocolli standard sono stati adeguati alle nuove norme di sicurezza, con l’utilizzo di guanti, mascherine, tute, stivali ecc. – sostengono i titolari – sia nell’interesse del consumatore finale sia nell’interesse degli operatori, i quali vengono sottoposti quotidianamente a preventiva misurazione della temperatura corporea.   «Tutte queste operazioni costituiscono un impegno di risorse – ha spiegato Luca Simula, amministratore unico – ma rappresentano un investimento utile e necessario che avvantaggerà un più rapido ritorno alla normalità. A ricompensarci per ora, e non poco, è la maggiore tranquillità e la gratitudine espressa da tutto il nostro personale. Vogliamo che questo messaggio possa essere recepito da altre aziende ma anche dai cittadini, nell’auspicio che la battaglia contro il coronavirus si vinca soprattutto tramite la creazione di un circuito virtuoso in grado di “contaminare” in modo sano il senso di responsabilità individuale e collettivo. E questo per arrivare al più presto verso un’isola covid-free appetibile per i viaggiatori e magari, progettare da subito l’allungamento della stagione turistica».

“We’ve done more modelling than I’ve ever wanted to in relation to the eleven home games we are scheduled for this year,” he told SportsNet.
 “Will it be four or six, or could we extend the schedule so it is all eleven and go into say October, November or even December?
 “But if the season starts in closed stadiums, which is a high probability, then we would only play games over there (in England), it wouldn’t make sense to play them over here. We’re still planning on eleven home games, but whether they happen or not is highly speculative.
 “I hate to say it with our fans listening. But if you were looking simply at the facts today, it’s going to be tough, we will follow the guidelines of the governments both sides of the water, but logistically, it’s very tough.
 “Where we are, given the guidelines given in each country and the department of health services, the allowance to return to training under strict rules and procedures, what has always been contemplated is to start with closed stadium games. That’s to get the game back up, in front of our fans, to provide Sky Sports with content they desperately need.”

With the photographs not capturing everything that Grimm put into her painting, she took some artistic liberties to pull off the water’s ripples and the duck’s reflection.
 “In my reference pieces, I didn’t really like the reflection so I had to make some of those of things up on edge,” she said.
 Although gifted in multiple painting styles, Grimm said she chose to paint the duck using the acrylic technique.
 “Acrylic paintings blend a lot nicer. They dry fast so you have to be really careful about what you paint on. Once it’s dry, you can’t get anything off easily,” she said.
 Having worked on the painting for a few hours per day between her studies, Grimm said she finished her painting in about one month.
 “I really like painting. It’s very peaceful. I just sit in our little studio by myself and listen to music while I paint,” she said.
 It will be a while before Grimm gets to enjoy seeing her original painting that netted her the top prize. Grimm said her painting will go tour along with the other duck stamp paintings that placed until possibly next May.
 The work will also be featured on the 2020-21 Junior Duck Stamp, which raises funds to educate and engage young people in wildlife and wetlands conservation and outdoor recreation, according to a news release from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Serive.

Dogru revealed: “It is possible Caglar can go to play for Barcelona this summer.


  “Barca already wanted to sign him when he played for Altinordu.


  “We negotiated with them and they presented a project, but we thought that he should go to a team where he would be a permanent starter for him to develop properly. For this reason, we decided to accept the Freiburg proposal.


  “I think only Liverpool have the power to sign Caglar in the Premier League because of his economic conditions, but we must not forget French teams. PSG could be a surprise.”

Alibaba, Xiaomi and Meituan - the only companies with dual-class or equivalent structures in Hong Kong - are typically among the top five stocks traded there by value each month.


  Adding the three companies could drive passive fund flows of US$3.7 billion into their shares, Morgan Stanley's analysts said in a note before the announcement. The tech trio are also eligible to join the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index.


  Alibaba has a voting structure different from the other two. A small group of current and former senior managers can nominate a majority of its board. But it is likewise treated as a dual-class shares firm by the Hang Seng Indexes Company.


  It is also the only one of the three with another listing elsewhere, in New York.


  Other companies with dual-class shares, such as U.S.-listed internet company Baidu and online commerce firm JD.Com are planning secondary listings in Hong Kong, Reuters reported this year.


  The Hang Seng is tracked by US$20 billion of exchange-listed products globally and $8 billion of local retirement plans, the index provider said in a consultation paper in January.

  He was rumoured to be taking part in a TOWIE reunion special alongside former rival Mark Wright and ex Amy Childs.


  But the coronavirus pandemic has resulted in a delay for the celebrations and left the reunion up in the air.


  An insider told OK! Magazine: "It's a real blow for the producers, they thought they would make TV gold with the old cast reuniting but they just can't make it work.


  "Of course they understand the severity of coronavirus and don't want to put anybody at risk so have decided it's best to call it off for now.


  "That's not to say that it won't happen in the future, but for the time being they've decided it's best to put it on hold.
