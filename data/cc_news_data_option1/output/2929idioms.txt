Age does not always equal success, and no one knows that more than Ben Richlin, who at age 14 runs his own balloon art business.
   
 Richlin is preparing to start his ninth-grade year at Holicong Middle School but he has a bit more on his plate than his fellow classmates. His business, Ben's Balloon Animals, is keeping him busy.
   
 For the entire month of July, Richlin has completed two to three balloon installations nearly every day around the county.
   
 "I thought it could turn into something like this, but it blew up way faster than I ever thought," said Richlin, who lives in Buckingham.
   
 Richlin's mother taught him how to make balloon creations, and while still in elementary school he launched the business.
   
 "When my mom was in college she dated a lawyer who was also a clown. I can barely say that with a straight face," said Richlin in between laughs. "From him, she learned the basics, and later in life, she taught me what she knew."
   
 At 12 years old, Richlin was looking for a way to make money but could not find a business that would hire him at his age. He added that his mom only did balloon twisting as a hobby, but he wanted to take the activity to the next level.
   
 "My mom proposed to me what we at the time called a 'birthday party' business. She taught me what she knew about balloon twisting and I learned a lot faster than I thought I would," said Richlin.
   
 From there he found a balloon twisting job on Facebook in 2018. Since, then Richlin's business rapidly expanded due to word of mouth and social media. Currently, Ben's Balloon Animals' Facebook group has over 700 members.
   
 Next, Richlin began to work large community events including the Doylestown Art Festival and tree lighting. Shortly after, people began to recognize him when he would go out.
   
 "A lot of time I will just be at Starbucks or somewhere and a little kid will start hugging me and scream about balloons. It's fantastic," said Richlin.
   
 Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, Richlin solely did in-person balloon twisting at birthday parties and festivals. However, when these events came to a halt Richlin was forced to adapt his business model.
   
 Now Richlin completes large scale balloon installations. The balloon creations are made prior to the installation and then placed in the ground with a stake on the customer's lawn.
   
 These installations range from balloon flower bouquets to life-size comic book characters. Recently Richlin created an 8-foot Wolverine balloon decoration for a recipient's birthday present. This creation is one of Richlin's favorites to date.
   
 "It was definitely the biggest and most intricate thing I have ever made. Some of the huge creations that I do are very detailed oriented. The Wolverine was a real creative challenge," he said.
   
 Richlin said that many of his larger installations can take several hours to create. The installations are used for a large range of events including graduations, baby showers, bridal showers and birthdays.
   
 "I am really proud of him. I love how much he is learning on the business side of things. Watching him grow as a young business person makes me smile a lot," said Richlin's mother, Mindy Berger.
   
 Richlin plans to continue balloon twisting but his long term career goals may not be with Ben's Balloon Animals.
   
 "I absolutely love balloon twisting and I plan to do it for the rest of my life but not for my sole career. Right now I want to be an ophthalmologist," said Richlin.
   
 However, after being in the business for two years Richlin still feels the best part is seeing his customer's reactions. Richlin described one of the best moments of his career was after he made an installation of the character Poppy from the movie "Trolls."
   
 "I saw this little girl running up to it with a huge smile and start hugging it. There is no better feeling than knowing something you created is bringing joy to someone," said Richlin.
