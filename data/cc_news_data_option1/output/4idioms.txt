In the meantime, the crypto industry has taken issue with the Swiss financial regulator FINMA, for insisting that Virtual Asset Service Providers (exchanges, banks and the like) have to pass on client detail for every crypto trade they make on behalf of clients. In the traditional finance sector, exceptions are made for very low transactions. Crypto players are developing a means to comply with FINMA’s tough Know-Your-Customer anti-money laundering requirements whilst retaining privacy for their clients. Watch this space.

Ed Sheeran’s popularity has multiplied since the start of the decade. At 2.4 billion streams on Spotify, “Shape of You” is Spotify’s most listened-to song, and it spent 12 weeks at the number 1 spot on Billboard’s Top 100 list. Ed Sheeran has had a crazy decade: he’s set the record for highest grossing tour with $775.6 million, broke Spotify’s record of first-day album streams with "Divide" (2016) and had two music videos — “Shape of You” and “Thinking Out Loud” — in the 10 most-played music videos of the decade. He’s won four Grammys, and he had a notable 2013 Grammys performance. As listeners, let’s just say we’re glad he started thinking out loud.

Amid all this, at a personal level the start of a New Year and another decade is a moment for many people to take stock of their lives and consider whether changes are needed. What about New Year resolutions like losing weight, giving up smoking, joining a gym and taking up yoga, reading more books or simply flossing your teeth daily? For what it’s worth, a Google search will provide the largely useless information that, statistically, more and more people are sticking to their resolutions – as if they would ever admit otherwise!

Ms Barron, who runs the Junction Gastro Bar and Guesthouse in Limerick Junction, along with her partner MJ Buckley, was hopeful her daughter would be “the first of many, please god”.
 “She is 6lbs 3oz and she’s very long. I don't know where she’s getting that it out of, I’m only 5ft 3” myself. (MJ’s) nearly 6ft so she might get it from his side of the family; we’ll give him the credit for that”, she laughed.
 Now that Ive seen her, I don’t know what to call her. She’ll come into herself in the next couple of days and I’ll choose (a name) then.
 Overwhelmed in the joy of it all, she added: “She’s amazing. She’s flat out here she’s oblivious to what is going on around her. It’s great, it’s a nice feeling.”
 “I’m feeling great, absolutely on cloud nine, but it’s still very surreal at the minute, it has to sink in yet.”

Dozens of yellow flags belonging to Iran-backed Shiite militias fluttered atop the reception area and were plastered along the embassy's concrete wall along with anti-U.S. graffiti. American Apache helicopters flew overhead and dropped flares over the area in what the U.S. military called a "show of force."

Bradham hasn't had a great season. Earlier in the year, he missed some time with a high ankle sprain and maybe it took him some time to recover. But recently he's played much better. Probably not enough to warrant exercising his option after the season, but he's been pretty good recently.

What amounts to illiberal and joyless intolerance, sometimes characterised as political correctness, has grown ineluctably in recent years. It seems to me that far too much importance is being given to the views of minorities who are determined to be outraged at the drop of a hat about matters which to most fair-minded people are trivial at best. The new expression ‘woke’, which is loosely defined as being committed to social and political justice - not least being alert to injustice such as racism - is surely an admirable aspiration. But trouble arises when those concerned all too often become intolerant in their beliefs and refuse to accept that alternative views exist, let alone that they should be respected. But there has already been a backlash of ordinary people – sometimes referred to as the silent majority – who resent being harangued by self-styled and self-righteous fanatics.

Adele has won 15 out of her 18 Grammy nominations, and in 2012, she won six Grammys in one night, becoming the youngest person to do so. Her album, “21,” was the best selling album in 2011 and 2012, and another of her albums, “25,” was the best selling album in 2015. Whitman students sang her songs in Whitman Idol in 2012 and 2016 and at the Talent Show in 2012 and 2013.
