McManaman Admits Liverpool Title Win 'Tinged With Disappointment'

In 1977 the world was a much smaller place than it is now.
 So, when a local council committee came up with the idea of running a special dolphin show in a community swimming pool, a lot of people were very excited.
 The animals were to be shipped from Scarborough - where they were being used as part of a regular attraction - all the way to Horwich, a small town in the north of the borough of Bolton.
 Everything was planned out. The water in the pool at Horwich Baths would be emptied and replaced with salt water and the facility would be closed to swimmers for three weeks while the show took place.
 These days there would probably be a lot more questions asked about the welfare of the poor dolphins, who had already been ripped from their natural habitat to perform as a children's attraction and were now being dragged more than 120 miles to a small-landlocked town in South Lancashire.

Since the unlocked Samsung Galaxy Note 10+ is typically available at a whopping $1,099.99 and up, this newest price cut doesn't exactly make the Snapdragon 855-powered handset a bargain, but it certainly makes it more appealing than its little brother.
    The aforementioned $250 discount is good for both an entry-level 256GB storage variant and a digital hoarder-friendly 512 gig configuration normally fetching $1,200, mind you, although it's also worth highlighting that the latter model is exclusively available in an Aura Black hue on Amazon, while the former can be had in a trio of paint jobs including Aura White, Aura Silver, and Aura Black.
    Before deciding which of the two you should go for, keep in mind that, unlike the "regular-sized" Note 10, the jumbo-sized Note 10+ comes with a microSD card slot for easy memory expansion. And speaking of memory, you may want to note (no pun intended) that the 256 and 512GB storage versions share a hefty 12GB RAM count as well.
    The rest of the outstanding specifications include a beautiful Dynamic AMOLED display with a centered hole punch, a large 4,300mAh battery with blazing fast 45W charging support, and a quadruple rear-facing camera setup consisting of a 12MP primary shooter, a 12MP telephoto lens, a 16MP ultra-wide-angle sensor, and a 3D depth camera that's frankly largely useless.
   
 Meanwhile, the 256GB Galaxy Note 10 is technically still available at its list price on Amazon, but for a no doubt limited time, you can get the extremely well-reviewed Galaxy Watch Active 2 included at no extra charge. That's actually also a pretty good deal, especially if you were planning to buy a decent Android and iOS-compatible smartwatch anyway.
