Trump more recently has created a rift with South Korea over sharing the cost of hosting the approximately 28,000 troops based there. Last year, the administration stunned Seoul by demanding a five-fold increase in South Korea's share of the cost, to $5 billion, and the two sides remain at loggerheads.

 Thank you for your support, and getting me on the ballot.
 As a candidate backed by the Maynard Progressive Coalition, I plan to focus on what Maynard residents are concerned for in town.
 I won't be in an office, I'll be here. Drinking the same town water, walking on the same inadequate sidewalks. Suffering all consequences right along next to you.
 This is my home. This is where I keep my family. Having lived here for the past 15 years, I remember the foibles and follies of years past. I know so many of you, from even a decade ago hanging out between Moreys and the PC.
 As a Maynard lifer, hoping to own a home someday, with a 4-year-old going into our public schools, you can be sure that I want the best for the future, as my own child is at stake. His health and safety rest on the shoulders of decision makers in this town, and I will take every concern seriously, and act for the people, young and old, poor, impoverished, homeless, I hear you all.
 And I care very much about the future of a town, but I want to focus on residents' needs, and not the revenue the residents bring into the town.
 Vote Alice for Board of Selectmen. I will work and care for this town, but most importantly you. Thank you Maynard residents.

An Orange SA West African subsidiary is issuing debt on the regional market for the first time to take advantage of higher demand for digital services amid the coronavirus pandemic. The outbreak of Covid-19 and subsequent lockdowns has made a plan by Dakar-based Sonatel’s to raise $171 million particularly timely, Chief Executive Officer Sekou Drame said in an interview. The bond sale is the largest in the history of the regional bourse, Bourse Regionale des Valeurs Mobilieres SA, or BRVM. Orange owns 42% of Sonatel, the largest security on the BRVM, with a market value of 1.28 trillion CFA. The carrier operates in Senegal, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Mali and Sierra Leone, while a sister company Orange Ivory Coast covers three other countries in the sub-region. Paris-based Orange is considering acquisitions in Nigeria and South Africa and an expansion into Ethiopia to grow further in Africa in the wake of the pandemic, Chief Executive Officer Stephane Richard told French newspaper Les Echos in an interview published Monday. The company will now use the proceeds of the debt sale to expand its 4G and 4G+ networks and develop its energy, banking and Orange Money businesses. “This is where we see our future growth,” Drame said. Orange’s Ivory Coast unit is launching Orange Bank later this year and the group plans to extend the banking operations to Sonatel countries, such as Senegal and Mali.

Both types of systems will require outdoor air as well as recirculated room air at the VRF or chilled water system's FCUs. This outdoor air can be provided by a number of sources. For FCU applications, the preferred ventilation method is a dedicated outdoor air system (DOAS) with an energy recovery heat exchanger to reclaim the building's exhaust air energy. FCUs should be engineered to remain on during occupancy and not cycle off when the thermostat's set point is satisfied. The cycling on and off of FCU supply air, for most applications, e.g., classrooms, is not allowed by state code, and the technician setting up the control sequence of operation should be trained to recognize this often overlooked requirement.

SMCC is riding a 17-game losing streak, having last won its season-opener in 2018. The Bears play in the South Division of the mighty Mississippi Association of Community Colleges.
 EHS head coach Ed Rigby noted the unusual nature of the signing taking place in front of just a handful of people due to the COVID-10 pandemic.
 “This is not a normal signing,” Rigby said. “Usually everybody is in school. This is a great opportunity for Dontrell. It’s an opportunity to do something a very small percentage get to do in high school and that’s play college football. That league will create opportunities for you. It’s an opportunity out of this world. You play football, which you love, and you’re great at it. It says something about your heart and spirit. Pick your friends wisely once you get there.”
 SMCC is touted as the top-ranked community college education-wise in Mississippi. Henry plans to earn an associate’s degree in either Diesel Mechanics or Welding.
 Henry was also recruited by a school out of California, among others, but said he really just wanted to play football somewhere.
 “It’s my favorite sport,” Henry said. “I like contact.”
 He’ll get little debate from some of Eufaula’s past opponents as he racked up 73 tackles and nine sacks in 11 games (he missed one due to injury).
 Henry had four sacks against Park Crossing along with five disruptions. Against Carver’s highly touted offensive tackle James Robinson who committed to Tennessee, Henry had a big night, beating Robinson on the game’s first play en route to a sack as well as beating the future Volunteer often. Henry enters SMCC at 6-foot, 3-inches and about 203 pounds.
 “Speed kills,” Henry said. “I’m going to go for 245 pounds.”
 Henry is the son of Natasha Farmer and Antonio Henry. He has a younger brother, Tre’mon Henry, and a sister, Chantal Farmer.
 “Dontrell is a rush end,” Rigby said. “That league he’ll be in is chocked full of people that have played in the SEC in the NFL. “

 This has been a tough year for all of us. But, despite the challenges, I see reason for hope. In Police Chief [Michael] Noble's letter on the killing of George Floyd, he wrote the department's culture is \"constantly trying to improve and always asking the question: What can we do better for our community?.\" This forward-looking message is one that should be adopted by all of us.
 So what can we do better?
 Our downtown is the heart of Maynard. It's why so many wonderful people have chosen to stay or move here, and it needs to be protected. In the short term, that means doing what we can to help vulnerable businesses survive through this pandemic. I applaud the recent efforts by town staff to allow for expanded outdoor restaurant and retail space. In the long term, it means supporting street beautification, encouraging regional events, and promoting ourselves through tools such as Discover Maynard.
 Maynard also needs to clearly communicate capital planning to its residents. The newly formed Capital Planning Committee is assembling a five-year capital plan. The Select Board needs to be actively involved in supporting or reworking this plan as it evolves. Given the need for water infrastructure, education, a senior center, and a new fire station, that won't be an easy process. But the board would do a disservice to our residents if they skipped that conversation and tried to advance these important projects piecemeal.
 I also believe educating myself is an important part of my public service philosophy. To that end I've been to every Select Board meeting since announcing my campaign in January. I've met with members or been to meetings of the Finance, School, Economic Development, and Master Planning committees as well as the Planning Board, Cultural Council, and the Friends of Maynard Seniors. Reflecting on these meetings, I'm struck by the large group of passionate, dedicated people working to support our town staff who are working to make Maynard a better place to live. If you're able and not already involved with a town body, I encourage you to serve.
 The uncertainty before us will require leaders who are willing to work with others, understand the challenges ahead, and be flexible when the situation changes. I'm ready to dedicate myself to serving you, and I would be honored to have your vote on June 23.

Many investors are wondering if now is a good time to sell stocks. The coronavirus-driven declines in the market are still fresh in our minds. The market is now in the third month of an uptrend, and the major indexes have recovered most of their losses.
   
 Strength in the equity markets stands in stark contrast to gloomy economic reports and news headlines. Investors who have held on to their stocks through the crisis are wondering whether the markets have gotten ahead of themselves.
   
 During recoveries, stocks lead
   
 At times, it can feel like stocks are disconnected from what's happening in the economy. Stocks have continued to go up over the past two months despite increasing unemployment, deteriorating economic fundamentals and the continuing spread of the coronavirus. It's tempting to dismiss what's happening in the market as "a bubble" or "manipulation."
   
 The truth is more complex.
   
 Although the economy did contract because of the pandemic, economists have not officially declared a recession yet. This makes it even harder to understand why the market is recovering so strongly. As the economy shifts gears from recession to expansion, stocks often lead the way.
   
 Economic data takes time to collect. Many measures of the economy won't show improvement until well after a recovery begins. Investors who wait for the headlines to improve usually find themselves missing out on much of the recovery in the markets. During times like these, wise investors think about the future, not the recent past.
   
 Why cashing out doesn't work
   
 History has shown that investors who stay the course do better than those who try to time the markets. This has been proved during previous bear markets and confirmed through academic research.
   
 Investors who stay the course tend to continue saving, contributing to their retirement accounts and reinvesting dividends and interest in their portfolios.
   
 Being a successful investor requires three things: buying low, selling high and collecting dividends along the way. Investors who hang tough have the advantage of accumulating additional shares at better prices. Those who cash out and sit on the sidelines miss the opportunity to buy at lower prices. They also miss out on dividends they could have earned.
   
 Stick with your plan
   
 It is absolutely OK to keep money you need to spend in the near future in cash. Your emergency fund should be in cash.
   
 Market corrections can happen without warning. The amount of cash you have on hand should be driven by your financial plan and spending needs, not by what you think the market will do in the short term.
   
 Remember, market timing does not work - financial planning does. Make a plan, stick to your plan, and invest for the long run.

It was on this day, two years back that England showed the world, their transformation into a complete ODI outfit.
 Against a strong Australian line up at Trent Bridge, the English not only managed to create the record of highest ODI total -- 481 -- but they also handed the opposition their biggest ever defeat, by 242 runs.
 It all started with a 159-run partnership between Jason Roy (82) and Jonny Bairstow (139). They gave their team a perfect platform to reach a big total. And then came Alex Hales, who just blew apart the opposition with his whirlwind 147 from 92 balls.
 His innings included 16 fours and five sixes. Skipper Eoin Morgan did what he does best -- coming in the middle order and taking the attack to the bowlers from the word go. He also smashed a quickfire 67 from 30 balls.
 A massive 21 sixes were hit in the innings along with 41 fours. For Australia, Ashton Agar was the most economical bowler, who gave away 70 runs in his quota of 10 overs, while the most expensive turned out to be Andrew Tye, who leaked runs and returned with figures of 0/100.
 Come the second innings, the fate of the match was already decided. A mere formality of Australian batting was to be completed. The English showed their dominance in the bowling department too and curtailed the runs right from the very start.
 The result of this was that only one Aussie batsman went past the fifty-run mark -- Travis Head. Adil Rashid and Moeen Ali emerged the bowling stars and picked up seven wickets between them.
 The Aussies were dismissed for 239.
