We're proud that our minimum wage is more than what most others offer even after their temporary increases in recent months, and we hope they will do the right thing for the long term and bring their minimum pay closer to ours."

Despite small but significant victories like these, the road ahead of us will be tough. For too long, we have been standing at a precipice, a place that Baldwin described as the center of a dreadful storm. And if we don’t do all in our power to change course, it will only get worse. It will be as the prophecy foretold in the black spiritual that Baldwin quotes at the end of _The Fire Next Time_ — that on the final judgment day, “God gave Noah the rainbow sign, No more water, the fire next time!” But if we do not falter in our duty, wrote Baldwin, “we may be able, handful that we are, to end the racial nightmare, and achieve our country, and change the history of the world.”

Around 60 players and coaching staff attended the event on Zoom after the club was closed because of lockdown during the coronavirus pandemic.
 After inspiring talks by club chair Peter Land, women’s section representative Tracey Williams, mini and junior section Keith Burke, club captain Marcus Nel, it was Director of Rugby Sam Waterman who presented the first award of the evening for Club Member of the Year.
 Both Waterman and Williams were nominated alongside Chris Young, Mark Walker and Kay Kaschek.
 And the winner of the award was Young, who Waterman called the “one person who stands out and stands out for me in many ways on and off the pitch. He’s the bloke I love to call a mate.”
 Up next was The Clive Sibley Award, which recognises unsung heroes at the club.
 In the nominated category were Chris Heath, Olly Ridge, Keith Bisedee and Duncan Kingscott, and it was Kingscottt who picked up the accolades.
 Up next was The Ann Whatley Trophy presented by Marcus Nel, which is an award is aimed at the under-18s, who are a big part of the club and uphold the values of the game through their loyalty on and off the field.
 In a tight race between all three nominees, Bryony Shepherd, Edward Land and Tom Burge, it was Burge who came on top.
 Williams presented the Peter Spencer Award which – like the trophy named after Whatley is another memorial award – focuses on someone who has given the club loyal service on the pitch or off it.
 Again, there were three nominations John Bamsey, Ann Davies and Young and it was Young who won the award.
 Up next was an award chosen by the players in the form of the Players’ Supporter of the Year.
 Nel said there was “more to it than what goes on the pitch” before revealing William Sugg was the winner.
 The last award of the evening was the Chairs Award and what was probably one of the most emotional awards of the night.
 The Club’s Chair may choose a member of the club who in their opinion stood out and was presented by Weston chairman Land, who said: “We are a club of tradition and I have felt as though I have been challenging that tradition throughout.
 “There was just something particular about this moment where one person – without wishing to decry three other heroes who were saving a man’s life – just stood out.”
 Those men in question were Tom Grice and Liv James along with Mike Young, Jamie Whiting and Mel James, who all picked up The Royal Humane Society Resuscitation Certificate for their contribution on that day in January.
 But it was James who picked the Chairs Award as the night ended, leaving the club in a good place ahead of next season.
 In another awards celebration held a week earlier Alex Howman picked up the Players’ Player and first XV Player of the season honours.
 Ben Tothill picked up the Young Player of the Season, while Young secured the United Players’ Player of the season and would go on to make it three triumphs for the week and Aaron Soloman who picked up the United XV Player of the Year.
 In the Athletic section the Player of the Season went to Lucas Williamson, followed by Nick Hawken winning the Players’ Player of the Season.

By 1992, the band had gained a loyal following, as part of the local bar and fraternity house scene, and began booking shows outside of their comfort zone, first playing a gig at 23 East Cabaret in Ardmore, PA, then at two venerable New York City nightclubs, the Wetlands Preserve and CBGB. “One of the reasons I didn’t tour with them when they were coming up,” says Reynolds, “is that once they started being established, they toured all year long and really dogged the road.” The band played hundreds of shows per year—in 1992, some 166 alone—and it was difficult for Reynolds to perform his own music (with his trio TR3) outside of an arrangement like that. (Plus, he had toured in the late ’70s in cover bands, too, and felt like he’d already experience the road.) DMB would end up making their way up and down the Eastern seaboard, having been welcomed with open arms into the budding jam band scene, which at that time, included bands such as Blues Traveler, the Spin Doctors, The Samples, Phish, Big Head Todd & The Monsters and Widespread Panic. That same year, Blues Traveler concocted a traveling carnival of a rock festival to showcase their and their friends’ music, the aforementioned H.O.R.D.E. festival. In ’93, DMB jumped on the lineup for a pair of home-state dates, rising to the level of headliner the following year, when the band arrived at SPAC for the first time. Later that year, they self-released their independent debut, _Remember Two Things_ , which consisted mostly of live cuts and one-off studio session pieces, featuring Reynolds on four out of the 10 tracks (it’s since gone platinum). Unlike their 25-plus song sets that they played at SPAC in 2019, DMB was allotted time for just nine songs at their SPAC debut, ending their set with “Typical Situation,” which would later appear on their major label debut, Under the Table and Dreaming, recorded just south of Saratoga at Bearsville Studios near Woodstock. Released on September 27, 1994, it was almost an immediate commercial hit, peaking at No.11 on the _Billboard_ 200 and vaulting the band into superstardom (it would eventually go six times multiplatinum). Reynolds appeared on every track, doubling Matthews’ guitar parts. The resultant album is nothing short of a glorious wall of sound.

Nothing sinks a movie like predictability. But in these uncertain times, the finely-tuned comedy of "The High Note" proves a welcome retreat. Most of what works is due to a top-notch cast exuding charm, good looks and just enough musical ability to strike a delightful chord. It's pitch-perfect, light- hearted entertainment for COVID-weary eyes - and ears.
 The scene is the glitzy world of L.A.'s recording industry. Cue a ton of establishing shots of the iconic cylindrical Capitol Records building. Inside, we find Maggie (Dakota Johnson), the put-upon personal assistant to Grace Davis, the demanding diva played by Tracee Ellis Ross ("Black-ish"). You'd be correct in thinking it's a redo of "The Devil Wears Prada," except "The High Note" is not as mean-spirited, but it does share the killer wardrobe.
 Want news like this sent straight to your inbox? Head over to PatriotLedger.com to sign up for alerts and make sure you never miss a thing. You pick the news you want, we deliver.
 The daughter of a disc jockey, Maggie loves Aretha Franklin and Sam Cooke and is a walking encyclopedia of music history. She wants to be a producer but is stuck picking up dry-cleaning, booking private jets and stirring green smoothies. All this while Grace's record company and manager (a snarling and scowling Ice Cube - is there any other?) conspire to put the aging star out to pasture with a Las Vegas residency. Except, Grace isn't going anywhere until she fulfills her desire to cut a new album - her first in a decade.
 Kelvin Harrison Jr. ("Waves," "Luce") is Maggie's first musical discovery. They meet cute at a grocery store. Soon, she's producing his debut album - on the sly from Grace, of course. As expected, Maggie runs herself ragged. Her two worlds eventually collide into a quagmire. You know how it goes. Egos are bruised and fallout is inevitable. It's the same old song. But, Johnson as the rising star and Ross doing her own singing as the superstar (think: a lighter version of her legendary mother, Diana Ross) are an inspired pairing. Their likability goes a long way in sustaining the predictable story.
 Nisha Ganatra (the underrated "Late Night") directs with a sure hand from a script by Flora Greeson that weaves the conflicts of both women together into a whole lot of self-empowerment. Greeson's script also calls out the music industry over its long-standing practices of ageism and sexism, which is something to sing about. Plus, there's some romance, some fun songs, a few laughs and a big 'ol twist that isn't as surprising as the filmmakers might think. But whatever - all the parts blend into harmony thanks to Johnson's immense every-woman appeal and Ellis Ross's knack at being a diva with a heart of gold.
 An amusing lineup of supporting players provides enough laughs to keep the movie bopping along. Zoe Chao is Maggie's BFF, the always reliable Bill Pullman is her doting dad, June Diane Raphael ("Long Shot") is Grace's loony house manager, and British comic Eddie Izzard makes a brief cameo.
 The film was originally scheduled to open in theaters two weeks ago, but will instead open Friday as a video on demand for a $20 rental fee. Sounds steep, but it's worth it once you consider what you'd pay for tickets and popcorn in a theater. It's like getting it for a song.

But it’s certainly going to be an uphill battle for Caffè Lena. “The whole music industry is a network that requires every piece of it to be up and running,” Craig says. “We’re bringing in national tours, and that means that people have to be able to tour to all parts of the country, that there has to be a critical mass of venues to play at and that those venues need to be able to deliver paychecks that sustain that artist and their whole team. And so, if venues like a 500-seater are operating at 50 percent capacity, that’s still 250 tickets. If a 110-seat venue is operating at 50 percent capacity, that’s 55 tickets, and you are very limited in who you can bring in.” Craig’s goal is to continue building out the venue’s online presence, so that once life returns to normal-ish, Caffè Lena will have a double dose of potential new members, sponsors or donors—the ones sitting inside the venue and the ones tuning in at home. It’s certainly not a perfect situation, but it’s a big reason why the venue has been the longest continuously operating folk music venue in the country. Sixty years in, and Caffè Lena’s still raging against the machine, showing the world that it's never been more essential than it is right now.

WASHINGTON (AP) - A day after threatening states that he would dispatch the military to quell protests, President Donald Trump appeared to be privately backing off his threat to deploy troops, with White House officials saying this week’s response to demonstrations across the country indicated that local governments should be able to restore order themselves.The shift came as protests in Washington and other cities over police brutality against minorities proceeded Tuesday with relative calm, a striking contrast to the harsh crackdowns outside the White House on Monday night. The president wanted to make the aggressive action in the nation's capital an example for the rest of the country, a senior White House official said Tuesday.The Defense Department has drafted contingency plans for how to deploy active-duty military if needed. Pentagon documents reviewed by The Associated Press showed plans for soldiers from an Army division to protect the White House and other federal buildings if the security situation in the nation's capital were to deteriorate and the National Guard could not secure the facilities.But interest in exerting that extraordinary federal authority appeared to be waning in the White House. Though the crackdown on the Washington demonstrations was praised by some Trump supporters Tuesday, a handful of Republicans expressed concern that law enforcement officers risked violating the protesters' First Amendment rights. The defense secretary also distanced himself from Trump's decision to walk across Lafayette Park for a photo opportunity at a church after the demonstrators had been cleared.Pentagon Chief Mark Esper, who walked with Trump to St. John's Church on Monday evening, insisted he did not know the president's destination."I didn't know where I was going," Esper told NBC News. He said he had expected to view damage to a bathroom facility that had been vandalized in Lafayette Park, across from the White House, and talk with National Guard troops positioned there.The protests have sprung up across the country following the death of George Floyd, a black man who died after a white Minneapolis police officer pinned him down and pressed Floyd's neck with his knee. Violent demonstrations have raged in scores of American cities, marking a level of unrest unseen for decades.The situation in Washington escalated Monday, becoming a potent symbol of Trump's policing tactics and a physical manifestation of the rhetorical culture war he has stoked since before he was elected. Nearly 30 minutes before a 7 p.m. curfew in Washington, U.S. Park Police repelled protesters with what they said were smoke canisters and pepper balls."D.C. had no problems last night. Many arrests. Great job done by all. Overwhelming force. Domination," Trump tweeted Tuesday, after a night in which heavily armed military forces and federal officers swarmed the city. Trump added, "(thank you President Trump!)."The clampdown on the protesters followed a weekend of demonstrations outside the White House. Trump had been furious about images juxtaposing fires set in the park outside the executive mansion with a darkened White House in the background, according to current and former campaign and administration officials. He was also angry about the news coverage revealing he had been rushed to the White House bunker during Friday's protests.He moved to respond aggressively Monday. In an evening address in the Rose Garden, he called on governors to ramp up the National Guard presence in their states to tamp down the protests. If they didn't abide by those orders, Trump said, he would dispatch the military to their states — a step rarely taken in modern American history.The federal government has provided all affected states with a list of National Guard resources available to them, the White House official said. The official added that Trump's message to governors was that if they don't use all the tools in their arsenal, they shouldn't expect a sympathetic response to any request for federal dollars to help with cleanup and recovery down.On Monday, 715 soldiers from the 82nd Airborne Division arrived in the capital area in case the situation in Washington escalated. They are now stationed at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland and Fort Belvoir in Virginia. Two more 82nd Airborne battalions, totaling 1,300 soldiers, are on standby at Fort Bragg in North Carolina, according to the documents obtained by the AP. The plan is named Operation Themis.The soldiers on standby in the Washington area are armed and have riot gear and bayonets. After the AP first reported the issuing of bayonets Tuesday, orders came down that soldiers would not need the knife-like weapons that can be affixed to rifles, according to two soldiers from the 82nd who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear they would be punished for commenting publicly. The idea that bayonets could be used in confronting civilians provoked an outcry on social media and among some members of Congress.Already administration officials were privately acknowledging that the Monday's events didn't serve the administration well. Some Republican lawmakers, who are typically in lockstep with the president or at least refrain from publicly criticizing him, said he had gone too far in appearing to use force to clear the way for his visit to the church."There is no right to riot, no right to destroy others' property, and no right to throw rocks at police," said Nebraska Republican Sen. Ben Sasse. "But there is a fundamental — a constitutional — right to protest, and I'm against clearing out a peaceful protest for a photo op that treats the Word of God as a political prop."Former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, said of Trump posing for photos holding up a Bible, "I just wish he opened it once in a while."Trump's Cabinet also played a role in what appeared to be an orchestrated event.It was Attorney General William Barr who gave the order for law enforcement to clear out the protest before Trump's walk to the church and ahead of Washington's 7 p.m. curfew. A person familiar with the matter said the decision was made earlier Monday, but had not been executed by the time Barr arrived in Lafayette Park to survey the scene Monday evening.

Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Senior defense officials told reporters Milley was also not aware that the Park Police and law enforcement had made a decision to clear the square or that Trump intended to visit the church. They had been in Washington to coordinate with federal law enforcement officials but were diverted to the White House to brief Trump on military preparations, the officials said.The White House, Defense, campaign officials and others with knowledge of Monday's events all insisted on anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.___Lemire reported from New York and LaPorta reported from Delray Beach, Florida.

Two months before DMB arrived for that gig in ’96, the band had released its second studio album, Crash, which went on to become their best-selling of all time, eventually cresting at No.2 on the Billboard charts; spawning a string of hits, including “So Much to Say” and “Crash Into Me,” to name a few; and going seven times multiplatinum. Most of what happened that night was a blur—the single-song encore was a fiery cover of Bob Dylan’s “All Along the Watchtower,” maybe an unknowing tip of the cap to the famed troubadour who’d famously played a pair of shows across town at Caffè Lena in the early ’60s—but above all, I remember feeling a great weight lifted off of my shoulders. I may have read from the holy scriptures at age 13—and that, indeed, was a special occasion—but this…this was a religious experience.

On the same day that DMB canceled their entire 2020 summer tour, including their July 10-11 run at SPAC, they also announced that they’d be honoring tickets bought for the shows on the same dates next year. So even if we can’t see or hear DMB in the flesh this year, let me suggest ordering a bottle or two—maybe a case!—of Dreaming Tree from one of the five wine stores in Saratoga that carries it, dusting off that DMB concert T-shirt, cranking up whatever you use to listen to DMB these days to 11 and closing your eyes. You might just find yourself in Seat 23, Section 11, Row LL at SPAC. And it might just be the greatest night of your life.

WEYMOUTH - Construction of a new $33 million Tufts Library has resumed, and the grand opening for the facility should occur in September.
 Mayor Robert Hedlund said construction has returned to "full speed" since it halted in late March under a statewide emergency order prohibiting work on "non-essential" projects because of the coronavirus pandemic.
 "We are back on a full-time line schedule that allows us to say that September is when it should be completed," he said.
 The two-story building was scheduled to be finished by CTA Construction in early June.
 Work at the site began to slow down after the Massachusetts Building Trade Council requested its members to stop working at various job sites around New England to avoid contracting the coronavirus.
 The work stoppage was compounded under an emergency order by Gov. Charlie Baker on March 23 which deemed the library construction was not an essential project.
 A recent easing of the emergency order by Baker has allowed work at the site to resume.
 Hedlund said the construction delay has resulted in some cost overruns which are "up in the air.
 "A delay like that would cost some additional costs," he said. "But we don't believe at this point that the town would bear those costs. It's not the town that caused the delay."
 Hedlund said his administration is starting discussions with CTA Construction about the additional expenses incurred by the delay.
 "I don't believe the cost overruns are too bad," he said. "I don't have any (cost overrun) numbers yet, because discussions have not taken place yet."
 Construction of the new library had been underway since May 2019, a month after the 53-year-old former Tufts was demolished.
 Town council approved a $33 million bond for financing the construction of a 50,000 square-foot facility at Hedlund's request in October 2017.
 The overall expense was reduced by a $12.1 million grant secured from the Massachusetts Board of Library Commissioners from State Sen. Patrick O'Connor, R-Weymouth, and State Rep. James Murphy, D-Weymouth.
 Town officials broke ground in March 2019, and Tappe Architects of Boston completed the building design.
 The new library will have a large lobby with a cafe for patrons to read a newspaper or periodical.
 Tappe Architects' design has a digital media lab with updated computed software, five community meeting rooms to accommodate small or large gatherings, an adult reading area, a large children's section, and a place designated for teen activities.
 There also will be a large outdoor amphitheater for hosting movie nights or small theater group performances.
 Patrons will enjoy a spacious view of Weston Park, which underwent a $1.5 million renovation in 2018-2019.
 These features are just some of the reasons why the library staff expects there will be an increase in the number of people applying for a library card and using the facility.
 The staff urges would-be patrons to immediately apply for a library card online to avoid waiting in long lines when Tufts opens in September.
 Residents can get a temporary pass or e-card online through the Old Library Network website at OCLN.org.

As coronavirus restrictions ease and Americans try to get back on their feet, hurricane season and the associated flooding could knock them flat again. One way to protect homeowners from compounding risks in the future is to make sure they see the full picture before they sign on the dotted line. "If you have to pay tens of thousands every year to live in a home, that signals to you that it's truly risky to live in this house,” Siders said, referring to the government’s practice of heavily subsidizing homes in flood zones. “When we subsidize it, we hide that, and so people don't necessarily know how at risk they are."

“As a journalist and producer I am always on a different shoot in a different location each week. Once the restrictions eased, my first stop was the ocean. I love to paddle board and kayak, so last weekend was the first time I ventured out again for some adventure and fresh air since March. The water was crystal clear on the Palm and very quiet as there were no big boats around. It was a well-needed outing for my mind body and soul. Just to feel a little normality again and be active can really help us all feel more positive about the future.

Beatty came under fire for comments he made in February during an equity training program designed to allow participants to better understand concepts of white privilege and implicit bias—among the elements seen as fueling systematic racism in the school system. During the session, Beatty said formerly enslaved people may have been less well off after their emancipation without having their needs provided by the former slave owners. In the weeks that followed, the Equity Committee and MSAAC formally requested that Beatty be removed from his leadership positions because of the remark.
