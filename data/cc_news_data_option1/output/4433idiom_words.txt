With Rajasthan Royals coming off two successive wins, they will indeed take the field as favourites and will be raring to register another emphatic triumph.

Notably, Kolkata registered a 37-run triumph when these two sides locked horns earlier in the season, and it will be interesting to see who comes on top this time around.
