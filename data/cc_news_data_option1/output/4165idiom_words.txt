Brazil had the better of the early stages and went agonisingly close to taking the lead early on when Giuliano’s free-kick was put into the box and Alex Teixeira was inches away from connecting with a header. Giuliano prompted A Seleção once again, playing the ball to Paulo Henrique on the left who crossed for Alan Kardec, but his volley was wide.

Abeiku Quansah had a goalbound shot saved four minutes after the break, but it was a routine stop for Rafael as Brazil did most of the pressing. Alex Teixeira should have done better but headed wide from Diogo’s centre and Alan Kardec had a golden opportunity but headed straight at Daniel Agyei from Souza’s cross.

Lim noted the government's stance that the CMIO system was necessary to ensure minority rights are safeguarded, but she said the concept of minority rights is in itself "problematic", and it would be better to talk about "citizenship rights."

Over the past 10 years, Faishal said, the proportion of Singapore's citizens is made up of 76 per cent Chinese ethnicity, 15 per cent Malay, 7.5 per cent Indian, and "others" at 1.5 per cent, according to the CMIO classification system.

In his own speech, two days after Lim's, 2nd Minister for Foreign Affairs and Education Maliki Osman said that "genuine differences and contexts" across races exist, but they need to be recognised and accommodated to allow a positive sense of racial identity to develop.

As the midway point to the second half approached, Ghana had more possession, but still, Brazil looked the more dangerous. Rafael Toloi slipped a perfectly- weighted pass for Alan Kardec to latch on to, but he fired wildly into the side netting. The No9 was guilty of missing yet another chance seconds later when he planted a free header from Douglas Costa’s cross over the crossbar.

Ghana, who boasted the tournament’s most prolific strikeforce in Dominic Adiyiah and Ransford Osei failed to muster a single shot on goal in a stop- start opening 45 minutes, punctuated by no fewer than 17 free-kicks, yet this was not the bruising encounter those statistics may suggest.

Douglas stung the hands of the goalkeeper with a shot from distance, but the major talking point of the first half came in the 37th minute when David Addo was given a straight red card for a foul on Alex Teixeira after the latter was breaking quickly on the counter-attack. While the Belgian believed Addo to be the last man, the Africans protested that both Jonathan Mensah and David Addy had tracked back to cover.
