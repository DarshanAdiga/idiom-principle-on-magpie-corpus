LUFKIN, Texas (KTRE) - In Angelina County there has been an increase in COVID-19 cases, and officials do expect to see a continued rise with schools going back to in-person learning and the approaching holidays.Angelina County Judge Don Lymbery said he is in close contact with the city and medical professionals. As of yesterday, the county was at a 6-percent COVID-19 hospital capacity rate. The number to avoid is 15 percent for seven consecutive days."If this was to happen, immediately it’s going to affect restaurants, it’s going to affect all businesses and everything, and those that are at 75-percent occupancy right now would be sent back to 50 percent,' Lymbery said.In drastic situations, Lymbery said some cases businesses could completely shut down based on where they infections are coming from. A few weeks ago, Lymbery gave the green light for bars to reopen.“Of course I got fussed at a little bit about opening the bars back up but you know, they’re a business,” he said. “They need to be able to operate, they need to be able to feed their families, and get back to some sense of normalcy.”Lymbery is also in contact with both hospitals in the county, and they’ve recently been able to send back some help the state provided.“I talk to both Woodland Heights and CHI often enough if there’s a need. They’ve all got Personal Protective Equipment and the manning is okay,” Lymbery said. “Matter of fact, we just released a lot of the state’s emergency nurses that have been sent in, in case we had a huge influx of infection here.”Lymbery says with the announcement of a COVID-19 vaccine, hopefully not too far in the future, that it will be given to emergency workers.“I know that once the vaccine is released I know that all of the first responders are going to be the first ones because they’re on the frontlines,” Lymbery said. “They’re going to be the ones that are exposed the most.”He reminds people to continue wearing masks and staying vigilant going into the holidays.Copyright 2020 KTRE.

"articleBody": "Bitcoin miners in China suffer a hike in electricity following the government's clampdown. Houbi sees massive BTC outflowas its users grow concerned. Roughly 74% of miners express dissatisfaction as they hope to move to a more friendly environment. It appears that the Chinese government is now taking steps to clamp down on cryptocurrency miners as it creates its digital currency backed by the yuan. Miners say that the high cost of electricity used for their activities might force them to seek alternatives. China goes after Bitcoin Miners The digital yuan creation has been in the pipeline as far back as 2014 and has since been set to launch this year. Meanwhile, China has continued to tighten its grip on cryptocurrency trading. These efforts by the Chinese government and the freezing of Bitcoin miners' bank cards can be tied to the government weeding as much competition as possible against the arrival of its fiat-backed digital currency. A famous Chinese cryptocurrency journalist, Colin Wu, has reported that 74% of miners surveyed attested to the drastic impact of the hike in electricity tariffs. Some other miners said they had shut down their mining operations for a month as they couldn't continue. As the Chinese government is cracking down on the exchange of crypto and legal currency, Chinese miners are facing a major problem in paying electricity bills. 74% of the miners surveyed told Wu that the payment of electricity bills has been greatly affected. pic.twitter.com/Sqi8DkP5zb

It didn’t happen that way. The creation of new countries and adjustments to international borders have slowed to a trickle over the last 25 years, and national independence movements have been somewhat sidelined as a major factor in international conflict. There are a number of reasons for this age of stasis, but one big one is that a series of cease-fires, compromises, and diplomatic fudges made in the ’90s froze many territorial conflicts in place. A number of those frozen but unresolved conflicts are now thawing.

It helps that TFC is known for looking after its staff and players. While all clubs look to do what they can to ensure their players can focus on their game rather than off-field issues, Toronto often goes the extra mile.
 With players coming from all corners of the globe, that can involve everything from finding a place to live to getting a Canadian driving licence.
 The club raised that bar during the pandemic, helping fly in relatives to help take care of families while players were away. Meals were delivered. Pets were looked after.
 "I don't know every club and how every club operates. But over the years I've really seen this club just take care of people," said Vanney, a father of four. "To understand people, understand the needs of people, be there to help solve problems for families and players so that they can focus on the task at hand and their jobs. And really go above and beyond to take care of the people that are involved in the club.
 "Understanding if the people side is taken care of, then that gives the player side of it a chance to be at its best."
 Vanney, who likes to be involved with his players, says that also makes his job "so much easier."
 After a tempestuous lead-up to the 2019 campaign with Sebastian Giovinco, Victor Vazquez, Gregory van der Wiel and GM Tim Bezbatchenko all leaving the club, Toronto seemed headed towards calmer waters in 2020.
 New deals for captain Michel Bradley, goalkeeper Quentin Westberg and key defender Chris Mavinga augured well. As did the signing of Argentine designated player Pablo Piatti.
 News in January that Bradley needed ankle surgery to repair an injury sustained in the MLS Cup final in Seattle was a bump in the road, magnified when star striker Jozy Altidore questioned the club's handling of the injury. Piatti's debut was also delayed by injury.
 After extending its pre-season stay in California for the Feb. 29 season opener in San Jose — a 2-2 draw — Toronto downed visiting New York City FC 1-0 on March 7. The team and the world then went into pandemic lockdown and Vanney's club did not play again until July 13 at the MLS is Back Tournament in Florida.
 After exiting in the round of 16 in a 3-1 loss to NYCFC on July 26, Toronto faced another wait. The club did not see action again Aug. 18, when it began a six-game all-Canadian portion of the schedule.
 Toronto played the final 12 games of the regular-season south of the border, with Pratt & Whitney Stadium at Rentschler Field in East Hartford serving as its home away from home.
 TFC will host its playoff games there, starting Nov. 24 against one of the play-in game winners.

Ethiopia was until last year governed by a four-party coalition, a TPLF- designed marriage of convenience that allowed each ethno-regional bloc a degree of autonomy and a share of the national cake. But the coalition began coming apart in recent years, and a popular backlash finally dislodged the TPLF establishment and, in turn, opened the door to Abiy. Keen on redistributing power and moving the country away from ethnic federalism, Abiy replaced the coalition with a single, nationally oriented “Prosperity Party.” The TPLF, concerned its relative influence would decline, fought the move, failed, and then opted out, leaving the powerful minority outside the national government for the first time in a generation.

San Diego Padres right-hander Mike Clevinger will undergo Tommy John surgery on Tuesday and the team expects him to miss the 2021 season.
 While making the announcement, the Padres said they signed Clevinger to a two- year contract through the 2022 season.
 According to MLB Network, Clevinger signed a two-year, $11.5 million deal with incentives that could push the total to $12 million. He will receive a $3 million signing bonus, $2 million salary in 2021 and $6.5 million in 2022.
 Clevinger was diagnosed with a right posterior elbow impingement on Sept. 23 after his final regular-season start against the Los Angeles Dodgers. He was removed from his lone postseason appearance, also against the Dodgers, in the second inning after feeling more pain in the elbow.
 This will mark the second time Clevinger has undergone Tommy John surgery. He missed most of the 2012 and 2013 seasons after undergoing the procedure while he was a minor leaguer in the Los Angeles Angels' farm system.
 Clevinger, 29, went 2-1 with a 2.84 ERA in four regular-season starts for the Padres after being acquired from the Cleveland Indians in a nine-player deal on Aug. 31. Overall, Clevinger went 3-2 with a 3.02 ERA in eight starts in 2020.
 Clevinger fell out of favor with the Indians after an incident in which he and fellow pitcher Zach Plesac violated COVID-19 protocols on Aug. 8 during a road trip in Chicago. Plesac was sent back to Cleveland the following day but Clevinger initially remained silent before the club learned he also was involved on Aug. 10.
 Clevinger was sharply criticized by teammates during a clubhouse meeting and the Indians placed him on the restricted list and subsequently demoted him to the team's alternate site.
 He returned to the major league team on Aug. 26 and was dealt to the Padres five days later in a deal that netted Cleveland six players, including outfielder Josh Naylor, catcher Austin Hedges and right-hander Cal Quantrill.
 Clevinger is 44-23 with a 3.19 ERA in 105 appearances (92 starts) with the Indians (2016-20) and Padres.

Tesla Inc., Elon Musk’s 17-year-old upstart carmaker, took a giant step toward blue-chip respectability Monday, getting named to one of the world’s most famous stock indexes in an action that will greatly broaden its investor base.
 The announcement that Tesla will enter the Standard & Poor’s 500 index Dec. 21 follows months of speculation, and one temporary setback, after the stock failed to make the cut during the index’s quarterly rebalancing in early September. The anticipation has helped drive a nearly fivefold rally in the stock this year to almost $390 billion, making the electric vehicle pioneer the biggest company ever to be added to the gauge. It will also be one of the index’s most influential constituents with a weighting that falls around those of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., Johnson & Johnson and Procter & Gamble Co.
 It’s so big that S&P Dow Jones Indices said it is seeking feedback from the investment community to determine if Tesla should be added all at once or in two separate pieces. The company that Tesla is to replace in the index will be named later, the index provider said.
 Tesla shares rose as much as 15% to $467.50 in extended New York trading on the news.

“We didn’t even get to go to the Big Ten Tournament. The day that we were flying out to the Big Ten Tournament we didn’t even practice because we found out right before that they canceled it, and then the NCAA Tournament got canceled. For the guys that are returning, we truly feel like we missed something that we could have done last season,” Wiggins said. “So we’re coming back with a hunger in us. We have this fire in us that we want to get back in that same position that we were in last year when our season ended.”
 While Wiggins and Morsell are among the returning Terps, last year’s leading scorers, Anthony Cowan Jr. and Jalen “Stix” Smith, are not. The attrition has caused Maryland to fall from Big Ten champs a year ago to a team that is picked to finish in the middle of the pack, at best, in the league this year.
 But that isn’t shaking the Terps’ confidence. Instead, they’re embracing the underdog role and ready to prove any doubters wrong.
 “We returned like six of our top eight guys from last year, and we all came back hungry and eager to get back to the top of the pedestal,” Morsell said. “And we’re kind of embracing this underdog mentality. We know what we’re capable of. Everybody else might not know what we’re capable of, but we just focus on getting better every single day and just completing that business that we didn’t get to finish last year.”
 Wiggins and Morsell are Maryland’s two top returning scorers and will need to take the next step in their respective games to help the Terps exceed expectations this season.
 With an offseason unlike any other because of the ongoing pandemic, Maryland’s new top dogs had to find ways to make the necessary improvements to their games while staying in shape despite not having full access to the athletic facilities in College Park.
 But that’s what leaders do — find a way to make the team and themselves better regardless of the circumstances. And that’s precisely what Wiggins and Morsell have done.
 “We had to find ways,” Wiggins said. “We play at the Division I level for a reason and it’s because we love this game and we want to do it at the highest level. So we found ways. There were times when a couple of us would get together and just run 1 or 2 miles around campus, just to make sure we’re in shape physically. We lifted weights in our apartment or just with the tools that we had. We just had to find ways to make sure that we’re physically ready to go. We didn’t have access to any gym at one point so we had to find outside courts and play 5-on-5, play 3-on-3. You know, a full court type of deal so we can still get our reps in and stay in shape.”
 Expectations are high for Wiggins entering his third collegiate season. He has many of the measurables and the skill set pro scouts look for in a wing. After averaging 10.4 points per game last season, Wiggins will be looked to as Maryland’s primary scorer this year and can play himself into the NBA with a solid season — only adding to his motivation.
 As this year’s senior leader, Morsell would undoubtedly like to end his Maryland career on a high note.
 He acknowledged that he feels for those who aren’t returning like Cowan and Smith because they don’t get to try to strive for the postseason goals Maryland and the rest of college basketball were robbed of last season.
 But Morsell isn’t as concerned about what those in the past might have missed. He’s more focused on the unfinished business that lies ahead for him and his current squad.
 “As you know, last year the season ended unexpectedly and we didn’t get to finish it the way we wanted to,” Morsell said. “I know guys like Anthony didn’t go out the way he really wanted to end his Maryland career. I know Jalen’s gone and he didn’t get to finish how he wanted to finish.
 “But nah, I’m not doing anything for “Stix.” He’s about to be pretty well-off in life. This is unfinished business more so for me, my teammates, my coaches, and the program. But I do want to shout out to “Stix” though. That’s my man.”
 Maryland’s returning players are eager to get back to action and pick up where they left off. They’ll be joined by a group of newcomers that includes two freshmen guards and two transfer forwards.
 Mixing the hungry returning Terps with a crop of newcomers that will be motivated to make a name for themselves in College Park, is a recipe for success in the eyes of Wiggins.
 “The new guys have come in with the mentality to work and to push and to help make sure we’re the best team possible,” Wiggins said. “So I think everybody is just ready to go. We’re going to go out there and prove ourselves and play with a chip on our shoulder. And we have the group to do it.”

SHERIDAN — Abortion reporting in Wyoming is a morass of conflicting numbers, which may or may not provide the entire picture of what is happening in the state.
 But one thing is for sure, according to Crystal Merriam, advancement director for Legacy Pregnancy Center. These numbers — whatever they are — are important.
 “We serve people considering abortion as an option as well as people exploring adoption and parenting,” Merriam said. “Right now, we’re not sure if we’re reaching everyone who might need us. Are we serving all the people who are thinking about abortion or who might need post-abortion services? We don’t know how much of our potential demographic we’re actually serving. So that’s why the numbers matter to us, and they would be great to know.”
 But what exactly are the numbers? Well, that’s a little harder to decipher.
 Technically, Wyoming has required doctors to report abortions since 1977. House Bill 103 set forth the standard reporting form each doctor had to fill out, but there was no enforcement mechanism to make sure they followed through. This meant abortion providers often just avoided reporting to the state altogether.
 “I do not report to the state because it is none of their business,” Jackson Hole’s Dr. Brent Blue of the Emerg-A-Care abortion clinic told Rewire News Group in 2018. Blue is one of two doctors in the state who perform abortions.
 Historically, Wyoming has shared what abortion data it has collected with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The last CDC Abortion Surveillance Report in 2016 reported less than 20 abortions in the state, which may be indicative of the lack of cooperation from providers like Blue and Dr. Giovannina Anthony, also of Jackson.
 Reporting by the Guttmacher Institute — a pro-choice research organization, which spent its first four decades as a branch of Planned Parenthood — varies from CDC reports. The Institute collects its data by performing regular national censuses of all organizations known for, or suspected of, providing abortion services. Blue and Anthony told Rewire News Group that while they don’t report to the state, they do report to Guttmacher.
 Thus, the most recent data from Guttmacher— from 2017— may provide a clearer picture. The institute reported 140 abortions performed in the state in 2017 – drastically more than the 20 reported by the CDC a year earlier.
 “Since 1977— since I was 5 years old— there’s been a law on the books requiring abortion providers in the state to report, but it has been largely ignored, and we know this,” Mike Leman, legislative liaison for the diocese of Cheyenne, told legislators during a digital Labor Committee meeting Nov. 5. “The Guttmacher Institute’s reports suggest that there have been many more happening for the last four or five decades than the state was made aware of.”
 This discrepancy in data is why the Wyoming Legislature sought to sure up abortion reporting with the revision of House Bill 103 in 2019. The bill allows the Board of Medicine to sanction doctors who don’t tell the state they performed an abortion.
 Providers are now required to submit an induced termination of pregnancy — or ITOP— report within 20 days of an abortion procedure. The report includes information about the patient’s age, race, county of residence and previous pregnancies, including past abortions, miscarriages, births and children living or dead. It also requires details of the termination, including the type of procedure used, complications and gestational age of the fetus—including fetal weight and length.
 In addition to the physician requirements, the new legislation requires the Wyoming Department of Health’s Vital Statistics Service to submit an annual report on abortions to the public. When the changes to House Bill 103 were approved, legislators expressed hope the first report would provide clarity on just how many abortions occur in the state.
 “We passed this piece of legislation in 2019 because we were not getting the data from providers as far as how many abortions were actually taking place in the state,” said. Rep. Scott Clem, R-Gillette, who sponsored the revisions of House Bill 103. “We had independent institutions like the Guttmacher Institute that were reporting significant amounts of abortions within the state, whereas… we had testimony from our state health officer that we have had less than five abortions in the last five years... So we knew something was off. The idea here is that, to ensure that we have good policy, we need to have good data.”
 But even after the release of the first WDH report — featuring data collected during the final six months of 2019 — the numbers are as confusing as ever, legislators said during their digital meeting. If anything, the waters have been muddied a bit more.
 The 2019 report said 31 medication abortion procedures were performed in the state during the last six months of 2019. These included 26 procedures on Wyoming residents and 5 procedures on out-of-state residents. Eighteen of the abortions were performed after six weeks of gestation or less, while the other 13 were performed between the seventh and tenth weeks of gestation. There were no surgical abortions performed.
 Guy Beaudoin, deputy state registrar who prepared the report, said he was confident in the accuracy of the report prepared by the state.
 “I can only comment on the data that we get, but I guess… the confidence level is that previously we weren’t receiving reports like we are today so I’m confident that the providers understand the requirements that have been put into law, and I’m confident they’re following it because we (they) are getting those reports to us,” Beaudoin said.
 Others at the meeting — including Rep. Sue Wilson, R-Cheyenne — were concerned the report may not be providing the full picture.
 “The last (Guttmacher) data was like 150 or something,” Wilson told Beaudoin. “With this only being medication ones, it looks to me almost like any surgical ones are no longer being reported at all. I guess I don’t have quite your level of confidence. That doesn’t make sense to me. But I guess you only know what you’ve got.”
 During public comment at the committee meeting, those in attendance emphasized the state had a long way to go when it came to accurately representing abortions.
 “This report to my way of thinking… is unsatisfactory on many levels,” said Marti Halverson, former state representative and current president of Right to Life of Wyoming. “This report raises more questions than it answers. It frankly…seems cursory and minimal. Our members wonder why more comprehensive data is not available… We hope that future reports will look much different and be more comprehensive.”
 Evanston pastor Jonathan Lange responded to the data, as well.
 “At the most basic level, the Guttmacher report indicates that the implementation of Wyoming’s abortion reporting statute is only documenting half of the abortions that the nation’s leading abortion research organization is documenting,” Lange said. “In six months, 31 abortion reporting forms were received. The Guttmacher data would lead us to expect 55 to 70 of those forms in that same time period… I would encourage the committee to seek satisfactory answers to these questions.”
 Although most at the virtual meeting agreed the state’s reporting needed improvement, it wasn’t immediately clear just what changes needed to be made. Committee members agreed to review both the reporting form and the current legislation to determine what changes, if any, need to be made going forward.
 Merriam said she was hopeful the state could start collecting accurate, relevant data as soon as possible.
 “If every state did it and did it well, I definitely believe we would have a more accurate picture,” Merriam said. “But right now, the picture is less than clear.”

REDDING, Calif. (AP) — A man wanted for his role in an alleged $35 million Ponzi scheme was arrested Monday after evading FBI agents by swimming into California’s largest reservoir using an underwater “sea scooter,” federal prosecutors said. Matthew Piercey spent nearly 30 minutes in frigid Lake Shasta using the Yamaha 350Li submersible device before he eventually resurfaced and was handcuffed, the Sacramento Bee reported. It wasn't immediately known if the 44-year-old has an attorney. When agents went to arrest Piercey, he hopped in a pickup and led them on a chase that ended at the shoreline of the lake north of Redding. “Then, Piercey abandoned his truck near the edge of Lake Shasta, pulled something out of it, and swam into Lake Shasta,” federal prosecutors wrote in court documents calling Piercey a flight risk. “Piercey spent some time out of sight underwater where law enforcement could only see bubbles.\" Agents later learned Piercey had a sea scooter, a motorized device that pull users underwater at speeds of about 4 miles per hour (6.4 kilometers per hour), the newspaper said. Last week, a grand jury indicted Piercey and his business partner, Kenneth Winton, 67, of Oroville, the Bee reported. Piercey is accused of bilking investors into giving $35 million to his companies, Family Wealth Legacy and Zolla, promising guaranteed returns using an “Upvesting Fund” that allegedly was an algorithmic trading fund with a history of success, prosecutors said. Piercey allegedly admitted privately to an associate that there was no Upvesting Fund, prosecutors said. Piercey originally recruited Winton as an investor, but Winton eventually took on management responsibilities at Zolla. They used some investor money for various business and personal expenses,...

The Trump administration is expected to cut the number of U.S. troops in Afghanistan almost in half to 2,500 by Jan. 15, U.S. officials said Monday. The order would stop short of outgoing President Donald Trump's goal to have all troops withdrawn by the end of the year, which had faced opposition from military and diplomatic advisers.
 The Pentagon also expects to cut the number of troops in Iraq to 2,500, a reduction of more than 500. The decisions come as no surprise, following Trump's shakeup of the Pentagon leadership last week in which he installed loyalists who share his frustration with the continued troop presence in the war zones. The cuts give Trump an accomplishment in his final weeks in office even as he refuses to concede his election loss to Democrat Joe Biden.
 The officials said military leaders were told over the weekend about the planned withdrawals and an executive order is in the works but has not yet been delivered to commanders. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. There are between 4,500-5,000 troops in Afghanistan now, and more than 3,000 in Iraq.

 Quite a lot, actually.
 The Cowboys moved closer to the top of the race in the NFC East while firmly landing in last place in the division and moving one step closer to a Top 3 pick in the 2021 NFL Draft.
 The Philadelphia Eagles (3-5-1) remain in first place in the NFC East but their loss to the New York Giants (3-7) on Sunday brought everyone closer to the top. Washington and the Cowboys trail at 2-7.
 Washington is ahead of the Cowboys because of the head-to-head victory. And for those hoping for a premium draft pick, the Cowboys now have the third- worst record in the NFL behind the New York Jets (0-9) and Jacksonville Jaguars (1-9).

The listing venue was a victory for Nasdaq Inc. over the New York Stock Exchange. Airbnb’s listing is expected to be the biggest on Nasdaq since Facebook Inc.’s 2012 IPO.
 Airbnb is set to join food delivery company DoorDash Inc., which filed Friday to go public, in a finale to what is already a record year for IPOs. Driven mostly by the proliferation of special purpose acquisition companies and to a lesser extent by software companies, an all-time record of more than $141 billion has been raised on U.S. exchanges in 2020, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
 Along with Airbnb and DoorDash, online discount retailer Wish Inc. and installment loans provider Affirm Inc. are expected to complete IPOs by the end of the year, people familiar with their plans have said.
 After its business was throttled by the pandemic in March, Airbnb began seeing signs of recovery in June, with bookings down only 30% for the month compared with 2019, people familiar with the matter have said. That compared with a 70% decline in May from a year earlier.

Bell County, which had 217,149 registered voters this election, reported a voter turnout of nearly 59 percent. Dutton said that figure is in line with past voter turnout statistics in Bell County.
 “That is pretty typical for a presidential election in Bell County,” he said. “We usually run between 50 and 60 percent and this year stayed true.”
 Dutton also highlighted how a majority of Bell County voters cast their ballots during Texas’ early voting period, which ran from Oct. 13 to Oct. 30.
 “We had a total ballots cast of 128,035, and of those (ballots) early voting accounted for 92,142,” he said. “I think the extra week that the governor gave really helped get folks out and vote early.”
 Just 23,330 votes came on Election Day.
 “We’re certifying the results are accurate,” Dutton said. “We have checked with our tapes from our early voting and Election Day machines against the reports that we got from our election reporting software … and everything has matched up.”
 Dutton stressed how Bell County’s ballot-casting machines are highly secure after Schumann posed a question regarding the voting software’s security.
 “We use ES&S election system services and everything we use is secure,” he said. “If someone was to try and hack it, they’d have to actually get physical access to our machines. Anything that calculates results is very tied down and very secure.”
 Dutton added how Bell County’s poll books, which merely reflect voter information, also have incredibly limited access.
 “The poll books don’t really have internet access. They just have network access through our Virtual Private Network,” he said. “(But) the only thing exchanged is voter data. It lets you know that ‘person A’ checked in at this site on this date and time. There are no results that get passed back and forth between that software.”

"I think one of her great strengths is she's a very focused athlete on what she wants to accomplish," said tennis broadcaster Robert Bettauer, a former national team coach. "So she doesn't get distracted too much and probably just didn't feel a need to get overly involved. In today's world on social media, I think that's pretty smart."
 Mike Naraine, an assistant professor with Brock University's department of sport management, said Andreescu appears to have struck a comfortable balance as she focuses on her on-court activities.
 "She's very professional and she's very by the book," Naraine said. "That's something that we don't necessarily see with younger athletes, 20-year-old athletes, in this day and age."
 Bruneau said Andreescu is training in Monte Carlo and will spend a few weeks in Dubai next month before going to Australia.
 "The positive thing is that she is obviously extremely motivated," he told The Canadian Press from Montreal. "She's always motivated so it's not a change. But when you're forced (off the court) and that's your life, you want that back badly."
 Andreescu started last year ranked No. 152 in the world before closing the season at No. 5 despite missing most of the spring with a shoulder injury. She won titles at Indian Wells and Toronto before making history at the Grand Slam in New York.
 "She had an almost four-month break between Miami (in March) and then playing Rogers Cup and the U.S. Open and she won both of them," said Bettauer, the CEO of the Pacific Institute for Sport Excellence. "Certainly one thing that Bianca will have in her back pocket is the experience of having had an extended break before and being able to come back and find her competitive confidence pretty quickly."
 Bruneau is planning to replicate match-like settings for the seventh-ranked Andreescu before the Australian swing.
 "There's another side of her strong mind that is very obvious in a year like this year," he said. "How she puts her head down, goes to work, and just prepares. Even if she has some tough news here and there, she's pretty impressive."
 If a tennis player were ever going to take a year-long break from the sport, this was probably the season to do it. Many top players remained off court or had part-time schedules due to the pandemic.
 Bruneau said he's feeling "very positive" about Andreescu's return.
 "We're going to make sure everything is in place," he said. "Hopefully it's going to be a nice story."

National security as related to the flag, state sovereignty and territorial integrity has a theological sanctity accorded to it in India and both the political leadership and an earnest citizenry swear by their commitment to this sacred calling. However, the sustained policy attention and material support to this domain is inversely proportional to the sanctity index.In the run-up to the HT Leadership Summit this year, premised on the apt theme of defining a new era, the realm of national security merits attention. An objective assessment of the challenges to India's national security in the current period would point to the inclusive nature of the concept of national security and how this has affected both the state and the citizen - from China to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).While the military stand-off with China across the Line of Actual Control (LAC) is more complex and strategic in terms of its subtext, the pandemic and the fact that India has lost about 130,000 citizens to this virus is indicative of how rapidly security challenges can evolve in the 21st Century and the need to prepare for them in an affordable and effective manner. The contours of the "new era", where India will have to prepare for its national security road map, is defined by an assertive China, an ambivalent United States (US) and the pandemic with its attendant consequences and constraints.The fact that Galwan happened and India lost soldiers along the LAC evokes a sense of deja vu -- Delhi was caught unawares and the adversary had surprised India again. Objectively assessed, this points to organisational inadequacy in the overall defence management of the nation as evidenced from 1962 onwards and one reiterates a plea made in the past - that India must rigorously review past lapses and apply the necessary policy corrections.The most defining feature of the new era for the Indian security planner is the grim reality that the national prosperity index has shrunk, due to the pandemic (it is estimated that GDP may drop by almost 10%), and hence the outlay for the defence sector for 2021-22 will be accordingly depressed. This tightening of the fiscal belt due to Covid-19 will be over and above the steady reduction in the capital component of the defence budget that has taken a beating progressively in real terms over the last decade and more. The adverse impact of this on the military inventory and the modernisation programmes has been significant.Within the prevailing fiscal constraints and given that the top political leadership of the country will remain invested in the domestic electoral cycle, the three big issues that warrant unwavering institutional focus to effectively navigate the new era are higher defence management organisational review and redress; improvement in material and human resource capabilities of the armed forces; and astute technology investment.Disaggregated, this translates into recognising lapses noted in detail in the Kargil review and asking those difficult questions as to why Galwan happened. Can the onus be placed on only security forces or should it go further up the pecking order all the way to the highest political level?Currently, India is in the midst of a major organisational transmutation with the appointment of a chief of defence staff (CDS) and certain macro policies are being unveiled to enhance jointness and an integrated management of single service assets. It is too early to arrive at any definitive conclusion about outcomes but to note that it does not appear all that smooth - which is to be expected.The most critical area is the nurturing of human resources and a recent proposal relates to reducing the pension outlay for military personnel by pruning the existing model and linking this to length of tenure to ostensibly reduce the pension bill. Alas, this initiative could have very serious long-term implications for the morale and motivation of the Indian fauj - its most cherished USP. If the young Indian soldier scaled the Himalayan peaks against all odds in the Kargil War and asserted 'yeh dil mange more' (give me more of this!), due credit must be given to the service conditions of the Indian soldiers by which they have been empathetically nurtured.Regrettably in recent decades, there has been a progressive lowering of the profile of the armed forces in the institutional framework of India and a number of policy measures to improve the welfare of the government employee have been denied to the soldier. These relate to pay, pensions and medical benefits and the double whammy for the Indian military is that not only the civilian counterpart but the police and paramilitary have moved up the ladder. India's ability to effectively deal with the many challenges to national security in the new era will be predicated, metaphorically on the quality of the gun and the man behind the gun. Both are in distress and it would be imprudent for the policymaker to ignore this reality.Technology has always been at the heart of enhancing and refining capability and a holistic techno- strategic review specific to India's national security needs the highest priority. China's footprint in various hi-tech sectors such as 5G and AI is illustrative. Given the Covid-19 triggered resource constraints, India needs to innovatively harness its talent, both within the country and in the diaspora to create a road map for appropriate niche technology induction.The new era will emerge with many challenges and opportunities that will impact national security in a continuous manner. An informed and nimble higher defence institutional grid that will focus on man, material and technology in a more creative manner is imperative.(C Uday Bhaskar is the director of Society for Policy Studies.

Gov. Phil Murphy could not have been more clear about a New Jersey sport community that’s under official scrutiny in battling the spread of COVID-19.
 “I want to state very specifically: Hockey is in our crosshairs," Murphy said Monday at his press briefing. "I’m not sure why, but we are hearing more than anecdotally a lot of non-compliance, including by parents.
 "I want anyone who is playing hockey or mom and dad that has kids playing hockey ... I have nothing against hockey but watch yourselves. We have that high on the list right now. And unless we see better compliance and lower levels of infection, we will take action.”
 That declaration comes a week after Murphy announced that interstate indoor youth sports had been banned to combat the spread of the virus.
 However couched Murphy’s sentiment was with good intentions, his language has irked both youth and high school ice hockey coaches. Murphy wasn’t specific about the type of non-compliance purported to be happening, but he did say that much of the non-cooperation the state’s contact tracers have faced of late was in the hockey community.
 “Now we are seeing a failure to cooperate in more than 60% of cases - again, this is anecdotal - but a lot of that is with hockey,” Murphy said Monday. “And we’re sick and tired of hearing this, folks. We reserve the right to take more drastic action, and if we don’t get better cooperation and better compliance, we will."
 Tom Bunting, head coach of Gloucester Catholic and the director of hockey operations at Hollydell Ice Arena, said there were some initial outbreaks among club hockey stemming from interstate travel for tournaments. Rinks had just opened back up to try and recoup some of money lost during the initial shutdown.
 “I was bothered by the way he laid it out," Bunting said. "I don’t think that’s exactly how it’s going down. You don’t have a bunch of people in hockey that think this is just (B.S.) and running around doing what they want.
 “I don’t think there’s a ton of people not wearing masks and hanging out on top of each other and not observing the rules. I just think that it’s a tournament-driven business. Spring hockey is big business for ranks and there are a lot of tournament rinks that make their money in April, May, June, July.”
 The interstate travel ban for indoor youth sports could help curtail the rising positive numbers but the governor’s language, according to Bunting, paints a negative picture that isn’t borne out by the facts.
 And that could affect a rink business that, even in normal years, could barely be making ends meet.
 “There’s a lot of people, myself included, that make their living doing this. Health is more important than money but these guys are just trying to stay open. They’re close every year to being in the red. If something goes wrong they’re going to lose money.
 “If we get shut down again in New Jersey ... people pay tuition to play and if we shut down tomorrow, we’re going to be refunding people. That will bankrupt a lot of rinks. And I’m not suggesting you put that over everyone’s health but I think there can be a good balance. This industry has a low success rate as it is. Now you’re putting people in the corner."
 Ken Lilien, head coach of the Verona-Glen Ridge hockey team and director of the Montclair-based Jersey Wolves Hockey Club, sees the restrictions and tries to adhere to them as best he can for the 130-plus families involved in his club.
 He’s had conversations with all players, specifically the older ones in the 16U and 18U club teams, about responsibility away from the rink and has backed that up with his own actions, opting out of his usual rotation of three adult leagues.
 Lilien’s club has a policy that if a player tests positive, the entire team is shut down for two weeks and if a player’s parent tests positive, that player is removed for two weeks.
 For all the precautions and measures taken, Lilien doesn’t want to be looped in with other winter sports.
 “We want to not get grouped in with basketball and wrestling because I believe [hockey is] safer than those activities,” Lilien said. “I don’t think it’s dangerous more than everything else but there’s a risk with these activities. There’s also a risk in not having our children have some socialization and some competition in youth sports that helps them grow.”
 Murphy discussed noncompliance of both players and parents. Under Monday’s updated rules on indoor gatherings, parents would be excluded from watching their kids play. The new rule limits attendance to 10 people beyond those essential to a game or practice, such as players, coaches and officials.
 “I do think that we have to look at this in a certain way," Lilien said. "Part of the problem is that, yes, not everyone is adhering to guidelines and that the guidelines are painful, especially for parents. Watching your son or daughter play sports is one of the great joys in life. But we have to be strict with the guidelines.”

In 1994, in a bid to quell ethnic conflict, the TPLF-led Ethiopian government instituted a new constitution that created nine ethnic-based federal states with a high degree of self-determination. While relatively effective at tamping down the violence for a time, the federal structure also had the effect of deepening and formalizing ethnic divisions. As Ethiopian political scientist Yohannes Gedamu told me last year, “It led to the growth of so many nationalist movements. Every political and economic grievance is voiced by ethnic parties or movements.” As in Yugoslavia before the 1990s, federalism put ethnic conflict on ice rather than eliminating it.

Sudan has dispatched troops to the region and, for now, has closed its border with Tigray — the landlocked region’s only outlet. Egypt has for years been at loggerheads with Ethiopia over use of Nile River waters and the building of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam; Cairo could exploit current circumstances to sow further divisions and improve its hand at the negotiating table. Somalia’s fragile government has long been underwritten by Ethiopian security, and a diversion of Ethiopian resources and attention could leave behind a dangerous security vacuum in a still highly vulnerable state. Finally, the United Arab Emirates has interests in both Ethiopia and Eritrea, and enjoys good relations with Abiy and Isaias — as well as Egypt and Sudan’s military brass. Abu Dhabi could conceivably be part of a solution, but it should take care to prioritize the interests of the two countries — not just their leaders — and to coordinate diplomatic efforts with the African Union (AU) and the wider international community.

President Donald Trump is expected to cut a significant number of U.S. troops in Afghanistan and a smaller number in Iraq by the final days of his presidency, U.S. officials said Monday. The plan would run counter to military commanders' advice over the past year, while still falling short of Trump's much-touted goal to end America's long wars.
 The decision comes just days after Trump installed a new slate of loyalists in top Pentagon positions who share his frustration with the continued troop presence in the war zones. But the expected plans would leave 2,500 troops in both Iraq and Afghanistan, meaning that President-elect Joe Biden would be the fourth president to grapple with the still-smouldering conflicts launched in the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.
 U.S. officials said military leaders were told over the weekend about the planned withdrawals and that an executive order is in the works but has not yet been delivered to commanders. Officials cautioned that there could always be changes, and Trump is known to make snap decisions based on media reports and online chatter. Officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.
 There are 4,500 to 5,000 troops in Afghanistan and more than 3,000 in Iraq.
 As news broke about the plan, Republican leaders on Capitol Hill issued stark warnings about making any hasty exit from Afghanistan that could jeopardize the peace process and undermine counterterrorism efforts.
 Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the Trump administration has made tremendous headway against terrorist threats, but warned against a potentially “humiliating” pullout from Afghanistan that he said would be worse than President Barack Obama’s 2011 withdrawal from Iraq and reminiscent of the U.S. departure from Saigon in 1975.
 Rep. Michael McCaul, Republican leader on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said of the plans for Afghanistan, "We need to ensure a residual force is maintained for the foreseeable future to protect U.S. national and homeland security interests and to help secure peace for Afghanistan.”
 Under the planned order, the troop cuts would be completed just five days before Biden takes office on Jan. 20. Military commanders have expressed less concern about the reduction in Iraq, where the Iraqi forces are better able to maintain their nation's security.
 Trump's new Pentagon chief, Christopher Miller, hinted at the troop withdrawals over the weekend in a carefully worded message to the force.
 "We remain committed to finishing the war that al-Qaida brought to our shores in 2001,” he said, and warned that “we must avoid our past strategic error of failing to see the fight through to the finish.”
 But Miller also made it clear that “all wars must end.”
 “This fight has been long, our sacrifices have been enormous. and many are weary of war — I’m one of them,” he said. ”Ending wars requires compromise and partnership. We met the challenge; we gave it our all. Now, it’s time to come home.”
 The accelerated withdrawal, however, goes against the longstanding advice of Trump’s military leadership, including Marine Gen. Frank McKenzie, top U.S. commander for the Middle East. But officials suggested that commanders will be able to live with the partial pullout, which allows them to keep counterterrorism troops in Afghanistan and gives them time to remove critical equipment fro the country.

 # South Carolina fires coach ahead of Mizzou game
 By Pete Iacobelli
 Associated Press
 COLUMBIA, S.C. – South Carolina fired football coach Will Muschamp on Sunday, the second time he's been let go from a Southeastern Conference program in midseason.
 The school said in a release that Muschamp has been "relieved" of his duties with the football program prior to the Gamecocks’ game against Missouri this Saturday. Athletic director Ray Tanner said first-year offensive coordinator Mike Bobo, a former head coach at Colorado State, will take over as interim coach.
 The 49-year-old Muschamp had four years remaining on his contract. His buyout from the school is $13.2 million.
 The Gamecocks are 2-5 and lost their third straight game, 59-42, at Ole Miss on Saturday night. It was a particularly glaring defensive effort for Muschamp, a national championship defensive coordinator at LSU in 2003, to watch his team give up 1,779 yards and 159 points in those three defeats.
 "It's concerning," Muschamp said after the Rebels amassed 708 yards of offense. "There is no doubt about that."
 Tanner said he did a thorough assessment of the football program and decided it was time for a change.
 "I appreciate all that Will Muschamp has done for our program and wish him and his family the best moving forward," Tanner said in a statement. "I believe our program will be well served by Coach Bobo as the interim head coach as we search for a new leader for Gamecock Football."
 Muschamp was head coach at Florida from 2011-14 and was fired in November of his final season after an overtime loss to South Carolina.
 Muschamp's stays with the Gators and Gamecocks were eerily similar. He led Florida to a BCS bowl and an 11-2 mark his second year there before going 10-13 before his dismissal there.
 At South Carolina, Muschamp became the first coach to reach bowl games in his first three seasons and went 9-4 in his second season. But the Gamecocks fell to 7-6, 4-8 and 2-5 since. He was 17-22 against Southeastern Conference competition at South Carolina.
 Things have gotten particularly bad the past two years. South Carolina pulled off a stunning 20-17 overtime victory at then-third-ranked Georgia in 2019. But the team has lost 11 of its 14 games since.
 Tanner and school president Robert Caslen met with the football players and staff to tell them of the change.
 Caslen called Muschamp a "true professional" who helped players succeed in the classroom and in the community. "However, I believe it is time to move in a different direction," he said.
 Caslen said the search for a new coach would start immediately and that Tanner, who had come under fire by some South Carolina supporters as the football team struggled, would be the one to find Muschamp's replacement.
 Bobo was let go at Colorado State after five seasons in 2019. Muschamp brought him in to spark up an offense that was near the bottom of the SEC.
 Now, Bobo will have to help the Gamecocks regroup with three games remaining in their all-SEC schedule.
 South Carolina has two home games upcoming against Missouri on Saturday and No. 13 Georgia on Nov. 28. The regular-season concludes Dec. 5 at Kentucky.

Bad news for anyone still trying to buy an Xbox Series X: Demand for the console is expected to outstrip the supplies until spring 2021.
 Xbox’s chief financial officer Tim Stuart made the forecast during an investor’s event last week. “I think we'll continue to see supply shortages as we head into the post-holiday quarter, so Microsoft's (financial) Q3, calendar Q1,” he said.
 According to Stuart, the supplies will only begin meeting the demand by the second quarter, which starts in April. “We'll have supply cranking over the next, what, four, five, six months. And that's when I expect to see really that demand profile start to be met,” he added. (A transcript of his remarks can be found at Seeking Alpha.)
 Currently, both the Xbox Series X and Series S are out of stock at all the major retailers. To buy them immediately, you’ll have to go to eBay, where third-party merchants are hawking the hardware for at least twice the normal pricing. Otherwise, you’ll have to wait for retailers to receive more stock. Both Best Buy and Walmart plan on selling some Xbox Series X units, in addition to the PlayStation 5, during their Black Friday sales events.
 During the investor’s event, Stuart also addressed Microsoft’s recent acquisition of Bethesda, and how the developer's games won't be made exclusive to the Xbox.
 “What we'll do in the long run is, we don't have intentions of just pulling all of Bethesda content out of Sony or Nintendo or otherwise,” he said. “But what we want is we want that content, in the long run, to be either first, or better, or best, or pick your differentiated experience, on our platforms. We will want Bethesda content to show up the best as on our platforms.”
 He went on to add Microsoft’s overarching goal is to use Bethesda's games to drive more users to Xbox Game Pass, the company’s Netflix-like service for gaming, which starts at $9.99. “If you think about something like Game Pass, if it shows up best in Game Pass, that's what we want to see, and we want to drive our Game Pass subscriber base through that Bethesda pipeline,” he added.

D&AD's most significant work lies in its support of students and graduates, and those new to the creative industries, which it champions through its excellent New Blood and Shift schemes. Its awards - the entry fees of which are of course crucial to its survival - often seem to sit apart from this side of its work, being expensive to enter and with the winning work, when displayed only in print form, hard to access. This new digital version bridges that gap, bringing all this incredible work directly into the hands of those across the industry, and across the world, to inspire and delight.

Another significant difference compared to other narco-submarines is that this seized vessel is fully submersible, at least for short periods of time. Virtually all narco submarines interdicted at sea have been more correctly termed low-profile vessels (LPVs). Also known as semi-submersibles, these are craft designed to run exceptionally low in the water to avoid detection. But they cannot fully submerge. This submarine's cylindrical hull, sealed roof hatch and hydroplanes all point to some degree of submerged running.
