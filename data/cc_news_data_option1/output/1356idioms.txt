In a last-minute press conference with the coronavirus task force on Sunday evening, President Trump tried to offer a message of hope.
 "We're starting to see light at the end of the tunnel," Trump said. "And hopefully, in the not-too-distant future, we'll be very proud of the job we all did. We can never be happy when so many people are dying, but we're going to be very proud of the job we did to keep the death down to an absolute minimum — the least it could have happened with this terrible, terrible virus."
 Dr. Anthony Fauci, a top immunologist and member of the task force, acknowledged the administration's messaging may seem contradictory — to both warn Americans about the grim week ahead while also offering optimism — but said it isn't.
 "If we start seeing now a flattening or stabilization of cases, what you're hearing about potential light at the end of the tunnel doesn't take away from the fact that tomorrow or the next day is going to look really bad," Fauci explained. "So we've got to make sure we realize we're always talking about a two-and-a-half-week lag."

Amy came to the emergency department with two seemingly unrelated complaints.
   
 She had had abdominal pain for three days, but hadn't experienced any nausea or vomiting and was eating and drinking normally. She also didn't have diarrhea but felt constipated and said it was painful when she did have a bowel movement.
   
 Her other complaint was that she passed out the night before she came to the emergency department, when she got up to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night.
   
 The thud from when she hit the floor awoke her husband, who immediately got out of bed to check on her. Fortunately, she fell onto the carpet and didn't strike the furniture in her room. Her husband helped her to the bathroom and then she went back to bed.
   
 She got up the next morning and didn't remember what had happened until her husband asked her about it.
   
 After grabbing a cup of coffee and a breakfast sandwich, she got into her car and started driving to work. The seat belt across her lower abdomen made her uncomfortable, and she considered not wearing it. Worried that something was wrong, she drove to the emergency department.
   
 As she was checking in, the triage nurse asked her about the possibility of being pregnant. She chuckled and said that there was no way because she was taking birth control pills and had had trouble conceiving naturally when she and her husband had tried to have children. The nurse put in an IV and drew blood. She then sent Amy to the bathroom to get a urine sample.
   
 Amy looked good when I went into her room, but her abdomen was very tender when I pushed on it. She was most tender in the right lower quadrant, which raised my suspicions that she might have appendicitis. But because a female's ovaries are in the pelvis in close proximity to the appendix, I also considered that her pain could be caused by a problem with her ovary.
   
 I ordered bloodwork, a CT scan of her abdomen and pelvis, and pain medications.
   
 About 10 minutes later, Amy's nurse told me that Amy was pregnant. I was surprised because she was on birth control pills, but they are not guaranteed to prevent pregnancy.
   
 I updated Amy and told her we were changing our plan to do an ultrasound of her pelvis rather than the CT scan we had initially discussed. She was shocked and began texting her husband to tell him what was going on.
   
 My concern at this point was that Amy had an ectopic pregnancy, which could explain her abdominal pain and passing out. An ectopic pregnancy is a pregnancy that is in the wrong place in the woman's body. Normally, a fertilized egg implants in the uterus, where it ultimately develops and grows into a baby. If the fertilized egg implants somewhere else, it is called an ectopic pregnancy.
   
 A pregnancy in the wrong location, such as on the ovary or within the fallopian tube, can cause pain and internal bleeding. This bleeding can be very dangerous and can cause the mother's death if not recognized and quickly treated.
   
 Amy had an ultrasound done, and the radiologist called to let me know that it showed an ectopic pregnancy near Amy's left ovary and there was a moderate amount of internal bleeding. The internal bleeding caused Amy's pelvic pain, and she had enough blood inside her abdomen to cause her hemoglobin level to have dropped when we checked her blood.
   
 My thought was that Amy passed out because the internal bleeding had caused a drop in her blood pressure.
   
 I went over the results with Amy and her husband, who had arrived. He reminded her that she had undergone a surgery on her left ovary when she was younger for a large ovarian cyst, which she had forgotten about. Scar tissue from that surgery had likely increased her risk for having the ectopic pregnancy. She went to the operating room within an hour.
   
 I am glad that Amy came in when she did and that we were able to get to the bottom of her pain and that she got her ectopic pregnancy taken care of quickly before she became more ill. She did very well through surgery and was able to go home the next day with only minimal pain from the surgery itself.

Holy Hogwarts, look at this entire dang Harry Potter-themed RPG built inside Minecraft. This mod has been in the works for a while, building on a huge Hogwarts Minecraft build from several years back. What I enjoy most is how reminiscent it is of the (not great, as I remember) Harry Potter games of the earliest aughts. The entire modded adventure is now available to play alone or with pals.
 Modding team The Floo Network say that the Witchcraft And Wizardry adventure map has you playing as an average Hogwarts student. It's a sort of Harry Potter mashup without any specific year in the series that it's meant to take place. "For example the Weasley twins are both at Hogwarts and run a shop in Diagon Alley," say their FAQs.
 The map supports up to four players in multiplayer, which is rad, but Floo Network say they aren't planning to host a server. You'll also need to be playing on the Java edition of Minecraft, not the newfangled Windows 10 version. Specifically, the mod is compatible with version 1.13.2 of the game.
 The launch trailer above is a merciless nostalgia tour that I feel entirely compromised by. Look at those brick blocks fold away to reveal Diagon Alley. Spot the brooms class complete with 2000s-era flying through hoops minigame. There's an angry little mandrake that you've got to wear earmuffs around.
 There are puzzles. There's a minimap. There are quest markers. Yes, I know many games have these things, but seeing them all dressed up as Harry Potter inside of Minecraft is like a miniature train--better by virtue of its unexpected form. Normal quest markers are boring. Harry Potter quest markers inside a Minecraft mod are magical.
 You can find the Witchcraft And Wizardry mod over on Planet Minecraft.

While the plight of fishermen and farmers has occupied the attention of the government, albeit after a delay, there is no word on migrant workers from West Bengal, Jharkhand, Assam and Odisha, who also ventured into the sea in significant numbers with local fishermen.
 Migrant workers have become a common sight in Kanniyakumari fishing. “It is difficult to get people for cooking, loading fish and other jobs during fishing voyages. These workers from north India come in handy. The salary they get is more compared to other menial jobs. I pay them at least ₹500 a day even if there is no catch. If we get more fish, we pay them more,” says W. Xavier, who operates a boat from Colachel.
 Xavier and his crew, with three youths from Kolkata, got stuck at sea but escaped although their boat got damaged. “After reaching the shore, the youths immediately returned to Kolkata. They told me that three of their friends, who went in another boat from Vizhinjam (in Kerala), had drowned,” he says.
 A. Nobin says that five of the eight persons, who drowned in the boat of his acquaintance in Colachel, were migrant workers. Gathering authentic information about them is difficult since they keep to themselves.
 S. Mukesh, from a village near Raipur in Jharkhand, who goes on fishing boats from Thengapattanam, says he and his friends are safe, but does not know about others.
 Migrant workers live on the boat itself even when it is docked, which makes it difficult to track them. A majority of them have returned home after the cyclone, some people say.
 Mr. Xavier points out that it will be difficult to trace missing migrant workers, unless they have friends on the shore. “They would have left their identity cards and cell phones on the boats. If the boats have drowned or drifted away along with the crew, how do we know their details?” Mr. Xavier asks.

By this stage in our international quarantine odyssey--which is what? week three? week seven? episode 27 of _The Twilight Zone_?--I'm willing to bet that it's not the home cooking that is sending you around the bend. It's _cleaning the dishes_. In my house, especially on weekends, cooking comes in surge tides as I cater to two toddlers, two teenagers, and two adults for three meals a day, plus snacks. Each wave of eating generates a concomitant wave of scrubbing and scraping all the pots and pans and plates and knives.
 On some days, I spend 12 hours in the kitchen, mostly at the sink.
 It is during days like these that the phrase "one-pot meal" shimmers like a magic incantation. I have found myself dreaming of cooking a single dish that can feed everyone in the house several times over--without my counter looking like a scene from _Grey Gardens_. So it's fortuitous that last week I found myself on the phone with Kevin Mitchell, a South Carolina chef, food scholar, and instructor at the Culinary Institute of Charleston.

 LONDON, April 6 (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson was in hospital undergoing tests on Monday after suffering persistent coronavirus symptoms for more than 10 days, but the government said he was in good spirits and still in charge.
 Johnson, 55, who tested positive for the virus on March 26, was taken to St Thomas' Hospital in central London on Sunday night for "routine tests" with what his Downing Street office described as mild and then persistent symptoms.
 His spokesman urged caution about media reports that Johnson was receiving oxygen treatment but refused to answer directly whether he had pneumonia. Johnson, the government said, was still in charge.
 "On the advice of my doctor, I went into hospital for some routine tests as I’m still experiencing coronavirus symptoms," Johnson said on Twitter.
 "I’m in good spirits and keeping in touch with my team, as we work together to fight this virus and keep everyone safe."
 Johnson, who had been self-isolating in Downing Street, spent a comfortable night in the hospital and remained there under observation, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said.
 There was, however, little detail.
 It was not immediately clear how an ill prime minister could lead the government's response to the outbreak from a hospital. Some medics told Reuters it was unclear what was meant by precautionary tests for COVID-19 complications.
 Doctors said a person of Johnson's age with COVID-19 symptoms after 10 days was likely to be assessed for their oxygen levels, lung, liver and kidney functions, and undergo an electrocardiogram heart check.
 Asked at a news conference whether Johnson had, or was at risk of catching, pneumonia, England's Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty said he would not discuss an individual patient.
 But he added that a "clear majority" of people who go to hospital with the coronavirus end up in a general, rather than intensive care, bed.
 PLAN B?
 Britain has no formal succession plan should the prime minister become incapacitated, though Raab, 46, chaired the government's emergency COVID-19 meeting on Monday.
 Asked at the news conference whether he had been in touch with Johnson on Monday by either text or by telephone, Raab said he had last spoken to the prime minister on Saturday.
 The government said Raab would continue to chair the daily meeting while Johnson was in hospital but some in the Conservative Party called for him to formally step in for the prime minister until he was better.
 "There are already problems which the prime minister’s illness will intensify," said Paul Goodman, editor of the ConservativeHome website.
 Raab, asked by a reporter if he was ready to take charge if needed, said he was not going to get into hypotheticals.
 U.S. President Donald Trump said Johnson was a "strong man" and that all Americans were praying for him.
 The pound fell against the dollar on news of his admission to hospital. It then rose when Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick said on Monday morning he expected Johnson to be back at Downing Street shortly and was trading at $1.23.
 "PRECAUTIONARY TESTS"
 On March 27, Johnson became the first leader of a major power to announce that he had tested positive for COVID-19.
 "Clearly the prime minister is finding it difficult to shake this thing off," said Jonathan Ball, Professor of Molecular Virology at Nottingham University.
 Medics said patients with COVID-19 can deteriorate after about 10 days, with some developing pneumonia. National Health Service guidelines advise those who are self-isolating not go to hospital unless they develop new symptoms or become sufficiently unwell.
 Johnson, who is not a smoker, said recently that he wanted to lose weight. He plays tennis and while mayor of London used to cycle around the capital.
 The face of the 2016 Brexit campaign, he won a resounding election victory in December before leading the United Kingdom out of the European Union on Jan. 31.
 But he has faced criticism for initially approving a much more modest response to the new coronavirus outbreak than other European leaders, saying on March 3 that he had been shaking hands with coronavirus patients.
 He changed tack when scientific projections showed a quarter of a million people could die in the United Kingdom. On Monday, health officials said Britain's death toll stood at 5,373.
 Johnson effectively shuttered the world's fifth-largest economy, advising people to stay at home and the elderly or infirm to isolate themselves for weeks.
 The virus, though, had already penetrated the British government.
 Johnson and his health minister tested positive last month and medical adviser Whitty also self-isolated. Johnson's pregnant 32-year-old fiancée, Carrie Symonds, also had symptoms but said on Saturday she was feeling better.

To reduce the number of people fishing at any given time and mitigate crowds during the COVID-19 public health crisis, DEM has implemented a system that staggers the days when licensed anglers can fish. Those with last names beginning with A through M can only fish on even numbered calendar days, and those with last names beginning with N through Z can only fish on odd numbered calendar days. DEM will also impose parking restrictions during the first two weekends of the fishing season and has removed porta-johns from fishing sites as a public health measure. DEM environmental police officers and DEM staff will be present at fishing locations to assist licensed anglers, answer questions, and monitor fishing spots for compliance, and the Department may adjust the fishing season if necessary.
 During the COVID-19 public health emergency, fishing should be enjoyed as a solitary experience, with just the members of your immediate household, and not as a group activity. Anglers must follow social distancing practices and maintain a distance of at least six feet from others and in groupings of no more than five persons. If you arrive at a favorite fishing spot and find that crowds are forming or the parking lot is full, please leave and choose a different location or return at another time or day. DEM will keep updating information to guide people and will post this information at www.dem.ri.gov/fishing. And, since State Parks are temporarily closed due to COVID-19, ponds in the major parks - such as Olney Pond in Lincoln Woods, Peck Pond in Pulaski Park, and Meshanticut Park Pond in Cranston - will not be opened until later this season.
 “While it may seem strange to some that DEM is allowing fishing during a time of crisis, we feel we can offer this opportunity to enjoy a traditional pastime while meeting health guidance,” said Director Janet Coit. “DEM staff will be out monitoring the next few days and weeks, and we will coordinate closely with the Rhode Island Department of Health experts to make adjustments as needed to maintain a safe atmosphere.”
 DEM’s Division of Fish and Wildlife is only stocking trout in larger waterbodies and locations that allow anglers to adhere to social distancing rules. This year, approximately 54,000 rainbow, brook, golden and brown trout are being stocked. Smaller waterbodies, including children-only fishing ponds, are not being stocked. Restocking will occur, but stocking locations will not be announced in advance to minimize crowds. For the safety of Fish and Wildlife staff, people should not approach staff while they are stocking fish. Visit DEM’s website for an up-to-date list of trout stocking locations. These locations may change, and do not include ponds in certain state parks and in children-only fishing ponds as they tend to be areas that attract crowds. For a list of non-stocked ponds, visit DEM’s website.
 This year, the Golden Trout promotion will be extended. Anglers will have until September 1st to send in their photos to qualify for a golden trout pin. The list of ponds is posted at fishing locations, www.dem.ri.gov, and www.facebook.com/RhodeIslandDEM.
 A 2020 fishing license is required for anglers 15 years of age and older. A Trout Conservation Stamp is also required of anyone wishing to keep or possess a trout or to fish in a catch-and-release or "fly-fishing only" area. Trout Stamps are not required for persons possessing trout taken from a lake or pond that shares a border with Rhode Island, such as Beach Pond or Wallum Lake. Fishing licenses can only be purchased online at www.dem.ri.gov/huntfish.
 License fees are $18 for Rhode Island residents and current members of the Armed Forces, $33 for a combination hunting and fishing license, $35 for non- residents, and $16 for a tourist three-consecutive-day license. Licenses are free for anglers over 65 (Trout Stamp not required) – as well as for those with a 100-percent disability. It is important to note that during the current stay at home order, out-of-state anglers should fish in their local state and are not allowed to drive into RI to fish for the time being.
 The daily creel and possession limit for trout is five from April 6, 2020, through November 30, 2020, and two from December 1, 2020, through February 28, 2021. The use of external felt-soled or any natural or synthetic porous material capable of absorbing water in any freshwaters in Rhode Island is strictly prohibited. This includes any waters shared with adjacent states in which Rhode Island fishing regulations apply. For more information on preventing the spread of aquatic invasive species, which can be transported in felt soles or other porous materials, click here. Prohibited is the transport of any plant or plant part into or out of any Rhode Island waterbody on boats, vessels or other water conveyances, vehicles, trailers, fishing supplies, or any other equipment, with the exception of authorized research activities, species identification and other management activities.
 Anglers must follow these guidelines during the COVID-19 public health crisis as follows:
 Do not visit lakes, ponds or other fishing areas if you feel ill or are exhibiting symptoms of illness.
 Plan a trip to a nearby fishing area for a short, local visit since restroom facilities are not available.
 Maintain a minimum distance of 6 feet between persons.
 Do not gather in groups of more than 5 people.

NEW YORK -- Americans braced for what the nation's top doctor warned Sunday would be "the hardest and saddest week" of their lives while Britain assumed the unwelcome mantle of deadliest coronavirus hot spot in Europe after a record 24-hour jump in deaths that surpassed even hard-hit Italy's.
   
 Britain's own prime minister, Boris Johnson, was hospitalized, 10 days after testing positive for COVID-19 in what his office described as a "precautionary step."
   
 Amid the dire news, there were also glimmers of hope some hard-hit areas -- the number of people dying appeared to be slowing in New York City, Spain and Italy. The news was cautiously welcomed by leaders, who also noted that any gains could easily be reversed if people did not continue to adhere to strict lockdowns.
   
 U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams offered a stark warning about the expected wave of virus deaths.
   
 "This is going to be our Pearl Harbor moment, our 9/11 moment,'' he told "Fox News Sunday."
   
 But President Donald Trump later suggested the hard weeks ahead could foretell the turning of a corner. "We're starting to see light at the end of the tunnel," Trump said at an evening White House briefing.
   
 In New York City, the U.S. epicenter of the pandemic, daily deaths dropped slightly, along with intensive care admissions and the number of patients who needed breathing tubes inserted, but New York state Gov. Andrew Cuomo warned it was "too early to tell" the significance of those numbers.
   
 Italy and Spain also got some encouraging news. Italy registered its lowest day-to-day increase in deaths in more than two weeks -- 525, said Angelo Borrelli, the head of the national Civil Protection agency. The pace of infection also seemed to be slowing.
   
 Even so, Borrelli warned, "This good news shouldn't make us drop our guard."
   
 Confirmed infections fell in Spain, too, and new deaths declined for the third straight day, dropping to 674 -- the first time daily deaths have fallen below 800 in the past week.
   
 The outlook, however, was bleak in Britain, which reported more than 600 deaths Sunday, surpassing Italy's increase. Italy still has, by far, the world's highest coronavirus death toll -- almost 16,000.
   
 In a rare televised address, Queen Elizabeth II appealed to Britons to rise the occasion, while acknowledging enormous disruptions, grief and financial difficulties.
   
 "I hope in the years to come, everyone will be able to take pride in how they responded to this challenge," she said. "And those who come after us will say that the Britons of this generation were as strong as any."
   
 Johnson, meanwhile, has been hospitalized, though his office said it was not an emergency and that the 55-year-old Conservative will undergo tests.
   
 There are concerns that Johnson's government did not take the virus seriously enough at first and that spring weather will tempt Britons and others to break social distancing rules.
   
 Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the U.K. might even ban outdoor exercise if people still ''flout the rules.''
   
 "The vast majority of people are following the public health advice, which is absolutely critical, and staying at home," Hancock told Sky TV. "But there are a small minority of people who are still not doing that -- it's quite unbelievable, frankly, to see that."
   
 As the numbers of infections rose, Saffron Cordery, the deputy head of Britain's National Health Service Providers, said the agency needed to focus on quickly increasing ventilator capacity and getting more protective equipment for health care workers.
   
 Italians have not been immune to lure of the good weather, either. Top Italian officials took to national television after photos were published showing huge crowds out shopping.
   
 Health Minister Roberto Speranza told RAI state television that all the sacrifices Italians have made since the nationwide lockdown began risked being reversed.
   
 Restrictions on movement vary from country to country, state to state, locality to locality. Swedes have been advised to practice social distancing, but schools, bars and restaurants remain open. In Germany and Britain, residents can get outdoors to exercise and walk their dogs, while in Serbia and South Africa, dog walking is not allowed.
   
 The ACLU filed its first lawsuit over coronavirus restrictions, arguing in part that Puerto Rico's curfew leaves people fearing arrest if they help elderly relatives by letting police determine who belongs in a family. A coastal community's mayor in Georgia fears the governor's mandate to open beaches will bring crowds to the small island with older residents and no medical facility.
   
 At the Vatican, Pope Francis blessed palms for Palm Sunday in a near-empty St. Peter's Basilica. At a New Orleans church, Rev. Emmanuel Mulenga blessed palm fronds and put them on a back table so people could get them while also observing social distancing.
   
 Worldwide, more than 1.2 million people have been confirmed infected and nearly 70,000 have died, according to Johns Hopkins University. The true numbers are certainly much higher, due to limited testing, different ways nations count the dead and deliberate under-reporting by some governments.
   
 The vast majority of infected people recover from the virus, which is spread by microscopic droplets from coughs or sneezes. For most people, the virus causes mild to moderate symptoms such as fever and cough. But for some, especially older adults and the infirm, it can cause pneumonia and lead to death.
   
 The rapid spread of the virus in the United States has prompted a chaotic scramble for medical equipment and protective gear.
   
 An Associated Press review of purchasing contracts showed that federal agencies largely waited until mid-March -- more than two months after the first warnings of a potential pandemic -- to begin placing bulk orders of N95 respirator masks, mechanical ventilators and other equipment needed by front- line health care workers.
   
 By that time, hospitals in several states were treating thousands of infected patients without adequate equipment and pleading for shipments from the national stockpile. Now that stockpile is nearly drained just as the numbers of patients requiring critical care is surging.
   
 When asked about the issue, Trump said federal officials and the military had worked "a miracle."
   
 Rebekah Gee, who heads the Louisiana State University's health care services division, warned that the private and public sector have been competing with each other, leading to price increases.
   
 Gee said one of her colleagues went on eBay to buy gowns, while equipment her department ordered from China got stalled for weeks in Hong Kong.
   
 "Our whole country is at war with this virus," said Gee, who once ran the state's Department of Health. "This needs a coordinated approach, and right now that's not happening."
   
 Louisiana and the New Orleans area have been hard hit by the virus, and Gov. John Bel Edwards has repeatedly warned of looming equipment shortages.
   
 Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said he hoped the pace of new infections would plateau soon, but that the virus is unlikely to be eradicated this year.
   
 Speaking on CBS's "Face the Nation," Fauci said the prospect of a resurgence is why the U.S. is working so hard to develop a vaccine and conducting clinical trials on treatments.
   
 Scientists are still learning about the virus that was first detected in late December in Wuhan, China. In what is believed to be the first known infection in an animal in the U.S., officials said Sunday that a tiger at the Bronx Zoo had tested positive.

That's the thing — the premise _itself_ doesn't even hold up. There's a lot of empty speak about "reclaiming the space" and whatnot, but at the end of the day the murder house is…still a murder house. I full-on felt like I was taking crazy pills when the third episode ended without the design team doing _a single thing_ inside the interior of the house. They just jazzed up the side yard, added a gorgeous gazebo, and threw in a swing set. The inside, where all the _murders_ happened? Exactly the same! _What was accomplished here_? Imagine if an exorcist told someone possessed by an unholy spirit to put on a prettier pair of shoes and then _dipped_.

When searching for a song, Spotify displays the most popular ones directly while you type, which allows you to immediately tap it to start playing it. Unfortunately, YouTube Music requires an extra step, as you first need to tap on the suggestion to bring up the search results and then select what you want to listen to. It might seem like I'm exaggerating, but after using Spotify for such a long time, this extra step is annoying if you spontaneously want to listen to a song.

 Amy came to the emergency department with two seemingly unrelated complaints.
 She had had abdominal pain for three days, but hadn't experienced any nausea or vomiting and was eating and drinking normally. She also didn't have diarrhea but felt constipated and said it was painful when she did have a bowel movement.
 Her other complaint was that she passed out the night before she came to the emergency department, when she got up to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night.
 The thud from when she hit the floor awoke her husband, who immediately got out of bed to check on her. Fortunately, she fell onto the carpet and didn't strike the furniture in her room. Her husband helped her to the bathroom and then she went back to bed.
 She got up the next morning and didn't remember what had happened until her husband asked her about it.
 After grabbing a cup of coffee and a breakfast sandwich, she got into her car and started driving to work. The seat belt across her lower abdomen made her uncomfortable, and she considered not wearing it. Worried that something was wrong, she drove to the emergency department.
 As she was checking in, the triage nurse asked her about the possibility of being pregnant. She chuckled and said that there was no way because she was taking birth control pills and had had trouble conceiving naturally when she and her husband had tried to have children. The nurse put in an IV and drew blood. She then sent Amy to the bathroom to get a urine sample.
 Amy looked good when I went into her room, but her abdomen was very tender when I pushed on it. She was most tender in the right lower quadrant, which raised my suspicions that she might have appendicitis. But because a female's ovaries are in the pelvis in close proximity to the appendix, I also considered that her pain could be caused by a problem with her ovary.
 I ordered bloodwork, a CT scan of her abdomen and pelvis, and pain medications.
 About 10 minutes later, Amy's nurse told me that Amy was pregnant. I was surprised because she was on birth control pills, but they are not guaranteed to prevent pregnancy.
 I updated Amy and told her we were changing our plan to do an ultrasound of her pelvis rather than the CT scan we had initially discussed. She was shocked and began texting her husband to tell him what was going on.
 My concern at this point was that Amy had an ectopic pregnancy, which could explain her abdominal pain and passing out. An ectopic pregnancy is a pregnancy that is in the wrong place in the woman's body. Normally, a fertilized egg implants in the uterus, where it ultimately develops and grows into a baby. If the fertilized egg implants somewhere else, it is called an ectopic pregnancy.
 A pregnancy in the wrong location, such as on the ovary or within the fallopian tube, can cause pain and internal bleeding. This bleeding can be very dangerous and can cause the mother's death if not recognized and quickly treated.
 Amy had an ultrasound done, and the radiologist called to let me know that it showed an ectopic pregnancy near Amy's left ovary and there was a moderate amount of internal bleeding. The internal bleeding caused Amy's pelvic pain, and she had enough blood inside her abdomen to cause her hemoglobin level to have dropped when we checked her blood.
 My thought was that Amy passed out because the internal bleeding had caused a drop in her blood pressure.
 I went over the results with Amy and her husband, who had arrived. He reminded her that she had undergone a surgery on her left ovary when she was younger for a large ovarian cyst, which she had forgotten about. Scar tissue from that surgery had likely increased her risk for having the ectopic pregnancy. She went to the operating room within an hour.
 I am glad that Amy came in when she did and that we were able to get to the bottom of her pain and that she got her ectopic pregnancy taken care of quickly before she became more ill. She did very well through surgery and was able to go home the next day with only minimal pain from the surgery itself.

As we've talked about before, the Pharma business tends to be seasonal since the out of pocket for consumers is greatest in the first quarter prior to having met their deductibles. And at that point, you see the pharmaceutical manufacturers in our payment solution standing in and providing that assistance, that co-pay assistance if you will. So, as I mentioned, the cash balance in February is $61 million, tends to be a seasonal peak. Last year it was seasonal peak in March.

As opposed to Jen, Judy tries to maintain a positive temperament, which Cardellini plays brilliantly, but some of her best scenes in the first season are when the pain of having had five miscarriages catch up with Judy and punch her right in the gut. The actress also makes you empathize with a woman who committed a hit-and-run, then tries to befriend the victim’s bereft spouse to cope with her guilt, which is a haywire act. Although the second season and thus Cardellini’s work are still unseen, she could capitalize on a rather wide-open field, since last year’s nominees Julia Louis-Dreyfus (“Veep”), Natasha Lyonne (“Russian Doll”) and reigning champ Phoebe Waller-Bridge (“Fleabag”) are not in the running this time around. And since Cardellini is a past Emmy nominee for “Mad Men” in Best Drama Guest Actress (2013), Emmy voters are already familiar with her.

North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper and health researchers laid groundwork on Monday to convince the public that social distancing orders could be needed beyond April to preserve hospital beds, dull COVID-19's spread and save lives. Cooper's current statewide stay-at-home order, which also prevents gatherings of more than 10 people, took effect a week ago and continues until April 29. A ban on dine-in service at restaurants and bars began March 17 and now continues until April 24. Cooper already has closed public schools through May 15. As elsewhere in the country, North Carolina's restrictions have contributed to a historic spike in unemployment benefit claims. Cooper's state Department of Health and Human Services gave the virtual stage to a team of epidemiologists and other health policy experts. They produced a report on whether the state's hospitals will have enough bed capacity to treat an expected surge of patients with the new coronavirus. The report, based on three independent research models, calculated chances that acute-bed capacity would be insufficient to handle the expected increase. If North Carolina maintains social distancing policies similar in effectiveness to those today, the chance is about 25% through June 1. If all social distancing policies are lifted after April, the chance grows to 50%, with rising bed demand taking shape by late May. Increasing the number of beds decrease the percentages only slightly, the report said. Maintaining social distancing policies “will likely allow our health care system to be able to manage the disease as it spreads throughout the state,” Mark Holmes, director of the Cecil G. Sheps Center for Health Services Research at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, told reporters in a conference call. “Relaxing all social distancing policies on April 29...

Welcome to the day the music died. Or, well, not entirely. Rocksmith still has plans for "weekly online content," but Ubisoft San Francisco have wrapped up their planned DLCs for the guitar tutorial game as of the newly-released Opeth Song Pack. The team is moving on to a new--as yet unannounced--project. More music? We shall see.
 Rocksmith still touts itself as "the fastest way to learn guitar," like the Duolingo of headbangin' and shredding. My only point of reference is a beat-up Guitar Hero set which I suppose is the kiddie pool version of guitar games, whereas in Rocksmith you plug in your actual six (or four) string. I never properly learned to play the guitar and I've not tried Rocksmith, so that's science by my book.
 Rocksmith has certainly had its fair share of content additions. "After 383 weeks of DLC releases, this pack brings us to a total of 1570 songs in the Rocksmith library, spanning over 7 decades (or 3 centuries, in the case of Bachsmith) and covering a multitude of genres for guitar and bass," they say. Yes, it really does have that many DLCs. Sounds like this band has been on the road long enough. Give those rockers a rest.
 "We still have weekly online content planned for Rocksmith fans. The Rocksmith Dev Stream will continue (in a new format), along with some more surprises," Ubisoft say.
 In the meantime, Ubisoft San Fran is playing a new tune. "We've been hard at work on a new project," they say, though no additional details are forthcoming. Presumably we'll hear more about that in some other format once Rocksmith's gotten to kick its feet up properly.
 You can get the rest of Ubisoft's own words on the matter in their announcement.

_From the Department of Environmental Management:_
 PROVIDENCE – The Department of Environmental Management (DEM) announces that certain Rhode Island lakes, ponds, rivers and streams that allow anglers to adhere to social distancing rules are now open to fish for trout. While freshwater fishing is open year-round for other species, trout were stocked by DEM earlier this year in preparing for a special trout season that opens traditionally on the second Saturday in April. DEM today adopted an emergency regulation opening the freshwater fishing season early this year with new measures in order to eliminate the large crowds that often accompany the traditional Opening Day of trout fishing season in April.
 “Everything about our normal routines has been upended by COVID-19, and we are asking people to take special care to respect a new system this year so that all anglers may safely fish for trout,” said DEM Director Janet Coit. “The reason we are opening early on a Monday and imposing a system designed to reduce fishing activity by half is so that we can open at all. In light of the risks and restrictions associated with the coronavirus, we had to design a new approach to trout fishing this spring. We hope that people will appreciate the opportunity to fish during a difficult time and allow us to keep trout season going by respecting the rules.”

One of those groups, Ashuelot Concerts, run by a husband-and-wife duo, has started live-streaming classical music performances and lectures from their home studio at 8 p.m. on Wednesdays and Saturdays. The broadcasts are found at http://ashuelotconcerts.org and on the organization’s YouTube channel. It’s been a change for the group, whose mission is all about live music, but they’re adapting, pianist Nicholas Burns, artistic and executive director, said last week.
 “So far we’ve had a very positive response,” he said.
 More than 100 people have tuned in to the live stream so far, and what he and his wife, violinist Louisa Stonehill, are now trying to work out is how they connect with that audience, and connect audience members to one another, he said. Those relationships are the whole point of a live performance, helping musicians improve their craft, he said.
 “We know the audience is there, but we can’t see their reactions or hear them breathe, and that undoubtedly affects how we play,” he said.
 When performing on-stage, Burns and Stonehill, education and artistic director, often go by the Steinberg Duo.
 Before the COVID-19 pandemic hit, Ashuelot Concerts relied heavily on live events for fundraising. With the in-person donation box office closed, the organization is relying on online donations, which it hopes will be sustainable, Burns said.
 In addition, the organization has an education component; it had played to 3,000 children at 14 schools in the Monadnock Region this school year.
 Burns said they’ve been in touch with music teachers to say they’re able to help and have received a list of requests to produce videos to enable some remote musical discussion and learning.
 “Now that we’ve gotten the technology sorted out, we can get to it,” he said.
 At MoCo Arts in Keene, the April vacation camp has been canceled, and the spring performance schedule is in jeopardy, Executive Director Reagan Messer said last week. Classes are continuing online, but that’s a challenge especially for the dance and theater programs where in-person learning is the best way, he said.
 “The arts are handed down from person to person, from generation to generation, and there is no better way do that than in the studio,” he said.
 When Gov. Chris Sununu originally ordered schools closed for three weeks, MoCo’s teaching staff worked together to produce 70 videos a week to send out to their students, Messer said. The videos were designed to keep students engaged, and the teachers adjusted their lessons so children could do them at home, he said. For example, a ballet class focused on exercises using the barre, while a theater class encouraged students to practice their lines and know their songs, he said.
 Sununu’s school closure order has since been extended to May 4. The order also requested people stay at home and required non-essential businesses to close through May 4.
 Messer said to adapt to that reality, MoCo will begin live-streaming classes today.
 “While it won’t be face to face, the teachers will be able to see their students, and the students will be able to see their teachers and each other,” he said.
 As for MoCo’s spring performances, Messer said they’ve been suspended, but not canceled yet. The nine performances have been moved to May and June, and MoCo staff have established the latest possible date classes need to be back in the studio to make them happen, he said.
 Right now MoCo is financially sound, but for how long will depend on whether the state’s stay-at-home order is extended to the end of June or beyond, he said. If that happens, the organization would be looking at losing revenue from canceled productions and potentially from summer programs, he said.
 Many area artists have begun quarantine projects, some of which will involve community participation, with people working separately and then bringing their creations together, Gelter said.

ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) — New Mexico’s finances have been hit by a double-whammy with the pandemic and an oil-price crash, but one of the state's most influential lawmakers said Monday that decisions made during the last legislative session to build up reserves will help cushion that blow — at least for now. In a message to fellow lawmakers, Sen. John Arthur Smith warned that a special legislative session and tough choices still lie ahead. “These are strange days, to say the least,” wrote Smith, chairman of the Legislative Finance Committee. “Within the time period the governor had to act on bills, the state’s fiscal outlook changed entirely.” Many of the state's new spending priorities and the upcoming challenges were outlined in a post-session review made public by the finance committee Monday. Legislative analysts reported that the state now faces “considerable uncertainty” in light of depressed oil prices that threaten to halt production growth or result in production declines. They say that would have severe implications for state general funds for the current fiscal year and possibly beyond. “Given the potential for oil prices to remain low and the U.S. economy to sink into recession in the coming quarters, even the recurring budget of $7.6 billion set for Fiscal Year 2021 may prove to be unsustainable,” they wrote. It’s still unclear how soon lawmakers could be called upon to revise the budget. In response to an order from the state Supreme Court, legislative leaders have been discussing how lawmakers could convene and vote through remote electronic means. A response is due to the court Wednesday. Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham on March 11 signed the budget for the next fiscal year while vetoing $150 million in infrastructure spending....

With only five episodes left in _How to Get Away with Murder _Season 6, you may be asking yourself whether the show is renewed for Season 7. Sadly, we won't be getting another year of Annalise Keating (Viola Davis) and her murder club's exploits since Season 6 will officially be the final season of the show.
 ABC announced in July of 2019 that _How to Get Away with Murder_ 's sixth season would be its last, giving the show ample time to wrap up all the show's loose ends. For some characters, that means a gruesome death, while for others it might mean a new chance at life with way less murder and mayhem.

Community-based disaster preparedness is of utmost importance along with government machinery to protect the lives of fisherfolk, deliberations at a workshop on ‘Ockhi – what next’ here on Saturday stressed.
 Organised by the National Fishworkers’ Forum (NFF) and the Kerala Swathantra Matsya Thozhilali Federation, the seminar was attended by experts from various institutions.
 K.G. Thara, who was earlier with the Disaster Management Authority; Muraleedharan on the National Institute of Oceanography, Sheela Nair of the National Centre for Earth Science Studies; Leela Edwin of the Central Institute of Fisheries technology; S. Jasmine of the Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute; Pramod of the Department of Aquatic Biology and Fisheries of the University of Kerala; J. Devika of the Centre for Development Studies; S.M. Rafi of the Kerala University of Fisheries and Ocean Studies; and K.V. Thomas were the participants.
 The speakers stressed the need to ensure that various agencies involved in disaster preparedness worked in close coordination to protect the lives of fishermen in case of a similar disaster in the future.
 ##
 Inclusion in disaster list
 There was a need to ensure that cyclone fury was included on the Union government’s list of disasters, especially as the State would continue to experience the effect of climate change, they said. The need to include cyclone in disaster management places of the State and of districts was also highlighted.
 Detailed plans should be drawn up about how many people were at risk, and how they could be rescued. Evacuation routes should be mapped and made familiar to the community.
 The speakers reiterated the need for communication systems to alert fishermen well in time to any possible disasters, and how to get out of its way in case they were already at sea.
 Adherence to standards for boat construction, need for more marine ambulances, training for boat crew, and ensuring lifesaving equipment on board were the other suggestions. They called for a token system to keep track of boats.
 There was a call to fix accountability for lapses and take steps against those found guilty in case disaster warning and management systems failed. The meet was inaugurated by Ockhi survivor Clement Banjilas.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, people have been avoiding any place where groups gather, ranging from restaurants to churches to gyms and fitness studios. Most businesses, including The Core Connection, have temporarily closed.
 These precautions are necessary, but unfortunate, as exercise can strengthen a person's immune system. It also reduces stress, which is important during these stress-inducing times.
 Strengthen your immune system
 While not much is known yet about fighting COVID-19, we do know that exercise has been helpful during previous flu epidemics.
 A study performed on 24,656 Chinese adults who died during the 1998 Hong Kong flu outbreak showed that mild to moderate exercise reduced the risk of dying. Other studies performed on mice demonstrated that regular exercise two to three months before an infection reduced the severity of the illness.
 While it's not clear why or how exercise increases your immunity to certain illnesses, there are several theories. According to Medlineplus, physical activity may help flush bacteria out of the lungs and airways, reducing the probability that you will catch a cold or flu, including COVID-19.
 In addition, exercise changes antibodies and white blood cells, which are the cells in the immune system that fight disease. When you exercise, these antibodies and white blood cells circulate in your body more rapidly, so they can potentially detect and fight illnesses earlier than they might have if you didn't exercise.
 In addition, our body temperature rises during exercise and stays elevated briefly afterward, which may prevent bacteria from growing and help the body fight infection.
 And, finally, exercise slows down the release of stress hormones, which also may protect you against illness. Stress weakens our immune systems and exercise reduces stress.
 "Stress hormones, which can suppress immune cell function, and proinflammatory cytokines, indicative of intense metabolic activity, do not reach high levels during short duration, moderate exercise bouts," according to the Journal of Sport and Health Science. "Over time, these transient, exercise-induced increases in selective lymphocyte subsets enhance immunosurveillance and lower inflammation, and may be of particular clinical value for obese and diseased individuals."
 Try this at home
 Being stuck at home is not an excuse for avoiding exercise.
 While your gym may be closed, many gyms are offering online classes, including The Core Connection. You can visit our website (thecoreconnection.com) to sign up or check out our YouTube channel for free recorded workouts.
 You can also develop your own workout, based on the equipment you have available and your individual needs and ability. During a previous column, we suggested a number of exercises that can be performed with little or no equipment and that certainly comes in handy in times like these.
 Push-ups, burpees, squats, lunges, jumping jacks, planks and many other exercises can be performed without equipment. Walking, for example, is one of the best exercises available and accessible to everyone and that comes with getting out in nature and breathing fresh air for extra added benefits. Consider varying your movement and your mileage to keep things engaging.
 Even though many retailers are closed, you can purchase yoga blocks, resistance bands, foam rollers and other equipment online. And there is always the option to incorporate items from home like canned goods and laundry detergent and using them in exercises such as lunges, bicep curls, dead lifts and rows.
 Be sure to warm up at the beginning or your workout and stretch at the end of your workout. In between, try to exercise every muscle group and keep up a pace that continues to challenge you.
 After the pandemic
 If you were working out before the COVID-19 pandemic, working out at home will make it easier for you to resume your exercise routine once the "shelter at home" period ends.
 If you haven't been working out, starting now will give you something positive to do while you're stuck at home. Hopefully, you'll continue working out when fitness centers reopen.
 This is a good time to develop good habits that you can continue even after the pandemic ends. After all, most people have more time on their hands than they had before COVID-19. In addition to continuing to exercise, hopefully you'll continue to follow the best hygiene practices that you established during the pandemic.
 Wash your hands often and be sure to wipe down the equipment you're using both before and after you work out. Doing so will help you and others stay health, which is important even when there's no coronavirus to worry about.
 One benefit of the Covid-19 pandemic is that it has made us all more aware of infection. Washing your hands thoroughly and regularly, and cleaning equipment can help you avoid illness at any time of year.

Longer term, Cleveland-Cliffs is positioned well to participate in the recovery. Short term, I'm not sure whether the negative impact from virus containment measures has been fully priced in the market. I must admit that I find it hard to believe that the bear market, which was caused by what could easily be the biggest recession of this century, ended in just a month. While the unprecedented measures announced by governments and central banks all over the world could help the markets, we haven't yet seen the full data on the true economic impact of the current healthcare crisis. Thus, while I'm inclined to participate in the upside momentum above $4.00 if such momentum presents itself, I'm not looking for sitting through thick and thin with a speculative position since I expect another leg down in the markets which will likely impact most stocks.

What the format will be, when play might realistically resume and whether the NHL might require games at neutral sites — how's North Dakota sound? — is anyone's guess.
 “Those are all fair questions but not ones that we have to resolve right away,” NHL Deputy Commissioner Bill Daly told The Associated Press by email, likening the situation for the league to “a multifaceted puzzle.”
 Over the weekend, the governors of New York and Florida both tamped down President Donald Trump's hope of sports resuming in August. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said: "I would love to see sports back to help with cabin fever. … But this is not about hopes and dreams and aspirations and what you would like to see."
 The NHL, which postponed play March 12, has several times pushed back its self-quarantine guideline — it's now April 15 — before players can even think about reporting to team facilities. The date is expected to be extended again.
 Wherever and whenever the Stanley Cup is awarded, one thing will still hold true as far as Pittsburgh general manager Jim Rutherford is concerned.
 "Whoever wins it, it is going to feel the same whenever they win it, on whatever day they win it, as it would winning it normally in the middle of June," Rutherford said.
 The latest the Cup has ever been awarded is June 24, in 1995 and 2013, with both instances following lockout-shortened seasons. The pandemic, however, has no timetable.
 That leads to questions over whether the NHL will have time to squeeze in any of the remaining 189 regular-season games to determine seedings, or skip directly to the playoffs based on the current standings, be it by based on total points or points percentages.

Queen: History will remember your actions in virus crisis
   
 (AP) -- In a rare address to the nation, Queen Elizabeth II plans to exhort Britons to rise to the challenge of the coronavirus pandemic, drawing on wisdom from her decades as Britain's head of state to urge discipline and resolve in a time of crisis.
   
 The 93-year-old monarch is expected to acknowledge the suffering that many families have experienced because of the COVID-19 crisis, which has infected more than 42,000 people in the U.K. and killed at least 4,313 of them. She will seek to lift spirits and offer hope to the country in its hour of need.
   
 "I am speaking to you at what I know is an increasingly challenging time,'' she said, according to excerpts released ahead of remarks that were being broadcast Sunday night. "A time of disruption in the life of our country; a disruption that has brought grief to some, financial difficulties to many and enormous changes to the daily lives of us all."
   
 The queen gives yearly Christmas messages but has given an address like this on only three previous occasions. She delivered speeches after the Queen Mother's death in 2002, before the funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales in 1997, and at the time of the first Gulf War in 1991.
   
 The queen will laud Britain's beloved National Health Service and others in essential services, together with around 750,000 people who volunteered to help the vulnerable.
   
 "I hope in the years to come everyone will be able to take pride in how they responded to this challenge," she said. "Those who come after us will say that the Britons of this generation were as strong as any.''
   
 "That the attributes of self-discipline, of quiet, good-humored resolve, and of fellow feeling still characterize this country," she said, according to excerpts.
   
 The crisis has hit close to home for the queen. Her son and the heir to the throne, 71-year-old Prince Charles, had a mild case of the disease. She herself left London, the epicenter of Britain's outbreak, and took up residence at her home in Windsor with her husband, the Duke of Edinburgh.
   
 Both the monarch and her 98-year-old husband are among those over 70 whom the British government have advised to stay home for 12 weeks.
   
 The address was recorded in the White Drawing Room at Windsor Castle. The location was chosen specifically because it allowed enough space between the monarch and the camera person, who wore personal protective equipment.
   
 Leadership expert James O'Rourke from the University of Notre Dame said that the monarch's remarks couldn't have come a moment too soon. With Prime Minister Boris Johnson ill with the virus himself, the queen offers a message of continuity to a country in lockdown.
   
 "Britons have not faced such grim circumstances since the darkest days of World War II, with the Blitz and the mass evacuation at Dunkirk in 1940," he said. "Now, more than ever, the people of the U.K. must have someone to reply upon, someone whose word they can trust."

WASHINGTON (AP) — For years, personal trainer Amanda Tikalsky didn’t have to worry much about her job. The U.S. economy’s record-breaking 11-year expansion offered security to service workers like her. Then came the coronavirus, which closed the Milwaukee athletic club where she worked for 15 years. She scrambled to organize online exercise sessions to keep money coming in. About 25% of her clients made the jump with her. \"It’s an adjustment for everybody,’’ she said. “We are used to being face to face.\" But even when the virus threat is gone, Tikalsky predicts that many customers will continue to exercise from home. The shutdown is also likely to change her own shopping habits. She has a new appreciation for the ease of buying groceries online. The pandemic is almost sure to leave a mark on the way people work, shop and socialize, perhaps permanently shifting the way many service industries operate. Consumers will think harder about the health implications of squeezing into crowded restaurants and movie theaters. More businesses will accept the effectiveness of employees who work from home, and the move to online shopping will accelerate. “We’ve never had a crisis where we couldn’t socially gather with people,” said John Gordon, founder of Pacific Management Consulting Group in San Diego, which advises restaurants. Until March, service workers — from dishwashers to real estate agents — had been enjoying a record winning streak in the job market. U.S. service jobs had risen for a decade. The sector appeared almost immune to blips in the economy. Not even low-wage competition overseas or automation seemed to threaten service jobs that require direct contact with customers. Then the virus arrived. It upended the service economy, which accounts...
