But something shook loose at the end of May, as the mayor and governor delivered promising news of the city’s success, for the time being, in bringing the spread of the virus under control, and despair over the news of the death of George Floyd at the hands of the Minneapolis Police Department reanimated long-standing frustrations with the NYPD. Summer arrived in the nick of time as protests ignited in upper and lower Manhattan, Queens, and the South Bronx, in every corner of Brooklyn, and even on Staten Island’s South Shore. Cable news and politicians have fixated on the looting and rioting, but lost in the fray, in this city at least, is the fact that after two months of action in the streets, COVID-19 numbers remain steady. Protesters are wearing masks. The movement didn’t just challenge us to close the gap between the country America is and the country it promised to be. It showed us how it’s possible, if we’re careful, to make it through this crisis together.

Making responsible seafood purchases can play a role in ensuring a healthy supply of seafood for generations down the road.
 In addition to including seafood, getting adequate vitamin C is also key. Vitamin C is needed for promoting a healthy immune system. It also aids in iron absorption and acts in the body like an antioxidant, helping us feel our best.
 Oranges are typically the first fruit that comes to mind regarding vitamin C. But, thankfully, many fruits and vegetables offer vitamin C. The recommended daily value is 65 to 90 mg per day. But, unless indicated by your doctor, most people don’t need to count it; including vegetables and fruits at each meal typically helps reach this goal.
 A few summer favorites that offer this nutrient include pineapple, kiwis, bell peppers, broccoli and strawberries.
 Consider combining your seafood choices with fruits and vegetables – and maybe even doing so by the water, for a combination of some Vitamin Sea and vitamin C. Grilled shrimp and pineapple salsa, tuna steaks with grilled veggies and fish tacos are all great summery options.

 # A picturesque paradise: The Eaves Old River & Swamp
 Joe Williamson
 Local historian
 The Eaves Old River is nestled in the beautiful and picturesque Sabine River swamp in Beauregard Parish. The swamp is home to a menagerie of animals, from wild hogs, snakes of every variety, squirrel, deer, panthers, bobcats, ducks, beaver, and otter along with an occasional sighting of black bears and alligators.
 Interestingly, it’s more of a lake than a river. Eaves Old River is similar to Cane River in Natchitoches - in the sense that Cane River was formed from an old Red River tributary. It too, is classified as a lake since it lacks an inlet and an outlet. These river-lakes usually form when silt and sediment from the main river blocks a tributary and essentially dams it up on two ends, leaving a lake.
 The Eaves Old River was formed centuries ago from a tributary of the Sabine River. It’s not the only one in this area though – there is also Horseshoe Lake, Moon Lake, Ryan Lake, Sand Lake and Palmer Lake (also referred to as Rhino River) - these are also old tributaries of the Sabine River.
 The area around Eaves Old River and the Sabine River was home to native Atakapa Indians that inhabited the area centuries ago. One can still spot remnants of arrowhead chips and other items from this lost ancient civilization.
 It was said that during the 1880’s and into the early 1900’s, the swamp was full of tall cane growing everywhere. The cows, no doubt, were described as fat as butterballs. The cattle were owned early pioneers, W. L. Y. “Bud” Eaves and his wife Elizabeth Nichols.
 Dating back to the early 1840’s, pioneer families have enjoyed the lazy old river and the natural beauty of the swampland. It was through these woods during the late 19th century that children would run to catch up with the steamboats that traversed the Sabine. Pearl Eaves and her brother Britt remembered running as fast as they could to the riverbank, once they heard the steam whistle echoing through the woods. She recalled bringing the riverboat captains armfuls of pine knots to fuel their steam engines - in return, they would give the local children sticks of candy or fruit.
 Britt Eaves remembered being a young boy at the turn of the 20th century and playing in the swamp near a little body of water known as the Button-Willow Pond, just adjacent to the Eaves Old River. One summer day he discovered baby alligators and decided to take two of them home, placing one under each arm. In the blink of an eye, the mother-gator came into sight and began to charge the little boy. He dropped the baby alligators and ran as fast as he could, never to make such a mistake again.
 Campsites have dotted the banks of the Eaves Old River for over a century. Everyone from Big Jimmy Eaves, Huey P. and Judy Parker Eaves, Norris and Jackie Eaves Williamson, Edwin and Dovie Nichols and John Allen and Wanda Franks Eaves all owned camps in the swamp at one point or another. Most of the land is still owned by the original families in the area.
 The oldest camp was built by Norris Williamson in 1962. Because of the lack of electricity deep in the thickets, Norris used a single gasoline chainsaw to build his camp. Despite the numerous floods over the last fifty years, the camp still stands today along with several others.
 Huey and Judy Eaves’ camp met its demise when a massive tree split it in half and tore through the middle of the house. It was torn down and the remnants buried. Today, there is nothing left of Huey or Big Jimmy’s old campsites.
 Britt Eaves would hitch up his horses to an old buckboard, load up the family and make their way through the woody hammock toward the edge of the river. The day was usually filled with perch-jerking, swimming, and picking sweet swamp berries – often, there were old timey fish-fry’s along the bluffs of the river and picnics. Before the sun began to sink, everyone would load back up in the old farm wagon and head slowly towards home.
 Many folks have enjoyed fishing along the old river over the years. Large alligator gar is plentiful in these muddy waters. The old folks talked about gar the size of automobiles and gigantic snapping turtles lurking about. It was said that one day Bryan Eaves was fishing in a boat on the river when he accidentally fell overboard and sank straight to the bottom. The river bottom is covered with thick silt and mud that can be dangerous. Bryan’s rubber boots became stuck as he violently tried to thrash himself free. He finally gulped just enough air into his lungs to pull his legs and boots up from the riverbed and pop-up to the surface.
 The swamp is also home to a few old haints and ghosts, long forgotten by time. The sound of a cavalry of soldiers trampling loudly over a wooden bridge can be heard in the twilight hours of the pitch-black swamp. Another instance was reported by a couple who claimed they heard someone scream out, “Help Me!” They rode all around the Eaves Old River looking for whomever might need assistance - as you might guess, they found no one in the area. Rusty Williamson recalled that one cold night he was out in the swamp coon hunting. He and a cousin walked to the edge of the tall Sabine River Bluff where they had a birds-eye view of Snaggy Bend sandbar. There on the bar they witnessed an enormous bonfire with a number of people around it. The two cousins commented to each other about how good the fire must feel, being it was such a cold night. The next morning, they rode down toward Jordan’s Branch bluff (pronounced “Jerdan’s Branch”) and found themselves at Snaggy Bend along the Sabine River. They observed no burned wood, no embers, and no footprints on the clean white river sand. There was no explanation for what had unfolded that cold dark night, deep in the Sabine swamp.
 There was nothing more interesting than going out to check trotlines at midnight while camping along the Eaves Old River. It was pitch-dark as the fishing boat would drift along under the low-hanging cypress branches, with its wiry Spanish moss hanging down thick, almost resembling scenes from that old picture Hush Hush Sweet Charlotte.
 There is a particular feeling that one gets when going deep into this old swamp. The smell is a mixture of ancient trees, vegetation, and dampness. Prior to Hurricane Rita in September 2005, there were hundreds of massive ancient trees covering the swamp like a shady canopy. Many of the trees were casualties of the relentless storm that battered it for hours. Despite hurricanes and storms through the years, the swamp still looks like a page from a calendar. Not much has changed there and most likely the swamp still looks much as it did hundreds or perhaps thousands of years ago when the Atakapa called it home.

A maintenance worker at a New Zealand hotel where returning travelers are isolated has tested positive for the coronavirus, the second instance of community transmission in the country since last week. But health authorities say the man’s close contacts have so far tested negative, giving them hope the outbreak might be contained. Meanwhile, a cluster of virus cases discovered last week in Auckland that sent the nation’s largest city into a two-week lockdown has grown to 69 after authorities reported 13 new cases Tuesday. New Zealand now has 90 active cases, including returning travelers who are in quarantine. Before last week, it had gone 102 days without any community transmission.

Intriguing though this is, we believe that a comparison with gold would be more fitting. Their similar potential as inflation hedges makes them a more natural pairing and one that the industry should monitor closely - especially when we begin to experience the long-term effects of quantitative easing on reeling economies around the globe. For anyone who doubts bitcoin's hedge potential, this week provided yet another wake-up call. Nasdaq-listed business analytics firm MicroStrategy confirmed that it has bought $250million of the cryptoasset, citing its "superiority [to cash] for those seeking a long-term store of value". In previous newsletters I've emphasised that institutional investment is essential for a future bitcoin bull run, and so this is certainly a promising development. As bitcoin's steady push higher continues, it is worth bearing in mind that a high bitcoin price can sometimes create a psychological barrier for the retail investor. Just like investors can get fractional shares, cryptoasset investors can hold fractions of bitcoins (Satoshis). Yet the fact remains that many retail investors will want whole bitcoins and the price of attaining them is moving further out of reach. It's a psychological peculiarity, but a reality nonetheless - and a future barrier to further widespread retail investment. Such a barrier highlights the importance of institutional investment. Ethereum fees hit an all-time high, but a fall could be on the horizon Ethereum fees hit an all-time high of $6.87million on Wednesday. This milestone is to be expected, as Ethereum continues to be the go to platform for Dapps. As we take steps towards Eth 2.0, it is likely that those all time high fees will drop. The Proof of Stake mechanism means that users of the platform won't have to compete with each other to complete transactions. We've also been impressed with the excellent documentation from the Ethereum team on how to stake. It is wonderfully coherent and widely accessible, which should be useful for future investors looking to receive staking rewards. Meanwhile, Ethereum Classic continues to operate in ETH's shadow having lost so much of its momentum in the fork. It is no surprise to see commentators calling for ETC to follow suit and switch to Proof of Stake sooner rather than later.",

To my eyes, the benefits in smoothness from having Adaptive Mode on are worth the little-perceivable impact of not having the display set to its maximum resolution. 120Hz is one of those things which, once you've lived with it, you won't really want to give up. The main downside is usually the impact on battery life, though there Samsung says its rate switching should offset that at least in part. In fact, it can even ramp down to as little as 10Hz if circumstances allow it.

First off, the Note 20 Ultra is capable of some fantastic shots. By default it captures 12-megapixel images, using pixel binning to combine data from clusters of pixels; you can manually switch into full resolution, 108-megapixel mode if you prefer. Colors are accurate, if a little saturated in HDR mode, there's great dynamic range, and the f/1.8 lens is capable of some pleasingly dreamy background blurring even without resorting to the Portrait mode. You can see with an icon in the upper right corner what the scene analysis has decided the subject is, and sometimes the phone will recommend a shooting mode or settings tweak, like switching to 2x zoom and moving back.

 Roosevelt — the first and only high school built exclusively for African- American students in Gary — has sat empty of students since February 2019's polar vortex wreaked havoc on the building's heating system, comprised of a series of difficult-to-access pipes original to the 90-plus-year-old structure.

In the essay “Trying to Like O’Neill,” Bentley uses his experience of directing a production in Zurich of “The Iceman Cometh” to see if he could at last embrace what critics as great as Stark Young and George Jean Nathan admired in O’Neill’s work. He didn’t quite succeed, though he gained a more acute awareness of the playwright’s strengths and weaknesses. In later years, he questioned some of his more polemical positions, but his fearlessness in bucking trends seems especially valiant in these days when social media has the critical world too often marching in lockstep.
 Criticism was never Bentley’s sole focus, and he came to feel that his reception as a playwright was hindered by his reputation as a critic even though he had long stopped wearing that hat. He insisted on being identified as a dramatist, and in the early 1990s when I was guest-editing a special issue of Yale’s Theater magazine, he stipulated that he would only consent to an interview with me if our conversation would focus on his plays.
 I regret passing up that opportunity, if only for the chance to have better understood why a writer utterly opposed to facile binaries was convinced that his critical and creative sides had to be kept apart. Bentley’s rich variety of theatrical interests is what made him invaluable. He may not have become a dramatist of significant stature, but his critical writing was immeasurably enriched by his work as a teacher, translator, author, director and playwright.
 His unparalleled career as a critic is a reminder that popularity is not the same thing as influence. He wasn’t an entertainer, one of the ingredients he thought went into being a good reviewer, but the lucidity of his writing gives pleasure all the same. His reviews at the New Republic didn’t have the power to make or break a show but they widened and elevated sensibility.

That may lead to an adjustment for how Congress or OMB ask agencies to plan for IT. In the end, the goal is to drive toward the same goal of modern technology and how Congress can enable that more quickly.”

The Mosier Creek Fire is fully lined and “isn’t going anywhere,” Oregon Department of Forestry representatives reported during the agencies first virtual community fire meeting of the 2020 fire season Saturday evening.   “We’ve had a very favorable outcome,” said Scott Stutzman, leader of the Oregon Fire Marshal’s blue team. Eight task forces, with 142 firefighters and support staff from throughout Oregon were deployed on the fire, in support of the Mosier Fire Department and Mid-Columbia Fire and Rescue. Oregon Department of Forestry, U.S. Forest Service and Columbia Gorge National Scenic Area crews were also working the fire, which was at 974 acres Saturday evening.   The fire is all trailed, and worked for the first 100 feet in. An airplane with a thermal camera is mapping the fire daily, and a detection camera has been set up with a full view of the fire area.   “We’ll be running a full day shift and a full night shift for some time. We still have plenty of good air support.”   “This fire is pretty much out,” said Mid-Columbia Fire and Rescue Chief Bob Palmer.   Palmer said the department was working another fire out at Interstate 84, also near Mosier, when there was a report of a fire on Carolle road, Palmer said. “About 15 minutes later, saw a large column of smoke coming up and we knew this was a more serious event than we though initially.”   “There were certainly some structures threatened, I was in contact with the sheriff, who was already involved, and was already setting up evacuations.”   “Things were becoming very serious,” he said.   Work began to set up a unified command, and preparation made to declare a conflagration with the state. “Everyone is working very hard to keep this fire within a specific perimitar, it could have had a lot more impact than it is,” Palmer said “Mother nature is a very formidable opponent and doesn’t give up easily. We have been able to keep the impact low.   “I am very appreciative of the citizens up there, who were very helpful in evacuating. There was not a lot of panic, they knew what they had to do. I commend everbody for their vigilance.”   “This fire is pretty much out, it’s still being attended to and there are still areas of concern, but its under control, Palmer said. “But the wildfire season is not over yet.”
 Nadine McCrindle of the American red cross said additional families arrived in search of shelter on Saturday, and just over 30 individuals are in shelter at the Shilo Inn in The Dalles. “We have established team of case workers, to help those who have lost their homes,” she said, adding that you don’t have to stay at the shelter to receive help.   McCrindle said donations of physical things are just too risky due to the Covid pandemic, and financial donations are better, and will be used to help provide food, shelter and relief supplies. “Our help is available to all, we don’t ask for paperwork or documentation,” she emphasized. The local Red Cross team in The Dalles can be reached at 503 318 6506.
 Mosier Fire Department chief Mark Renault said he was thankful for all the support his department received in fighting the fire. “With everyones support, with all the volunteers, we had about 80 firefighters on the line overnight (Wednesday) until we had state resources on the line. He encouraged residents in the district to contact the department regarding ways to reduce fire risk to their homes, including creating a 30-foot perimeter around the home and keeping accessory structures away from the home.   Scott Hege, a Wasco County comissioner, said the county was very appreciative of the local, state and federal response. “I live on top of Seven Mile Hill, and had a great seat to watch this fire. This was the first time I’ve gotten an evacuation notice,” he said. “If we choose to live out in rural areas, we need to take wildfire danger seriously and make sure we are prepared,” he added. Hege noted that a number of structures were lost, including two homes, and noted that the county had designed its planning requirements to assist homeowners in rebuilding. “We will help from a planning standpoint as much as possible.” He said those planning to rebuild should talk to county planners now about what they can and cannot do in terms of rebuilding.   ..Do as much as you can beforehand to make your property defensable. Its certainly possible.   Mariana Ruzz-Temple of the Oregon State Fire Marshal office said, “fires can be devastating in this area, we are feeling good about this fire, we feel good about the fire behavior and the number of firefighters we have working the fire.” He added that area residents will probably see firefighters in the area through August. “We all need to remain vigilant, human-caused fires are up 10 percent this year.”   Bill Hund, ODF afency rep   Joe Hessel one of two incident commanders with Oregon Department of Forestry,said he was one of two incident commanders on this incident, working with Scott Magers. “We are working together in unified command, with two teams joined together. Its a very successful model, and we are seeing the effects of that,” he said. “Our mission is simple and clean, to protect and minimize damage to resources, and damage to structures, infrastructure and other facilities.”   Hessel added the department was also working to needed protections regarding the pandemic. “Our firefighters are working in a very traditional manner on the fire, but camp life and support is focused on best practices in regards to Covid, he said. “We have a Covid module, specifically assigned to deal with Covid mitigation and exposure, and it’s helping us be successful on the firefighter front,” he said.

As I predicted in our not-quite-a-hands-on, the difference in performance between the Note 20 Ultra and devices using the regular Snapdragon 865 is... pretty subtle. In fact, unless you're sifting through benchmark test results, you'd be unlikely to spot the difference in day-to-day use. That's mostly because the "standard" 865 was already more than fast enough for most people. What the Note 20 Ultra _really_ offers here is a little more performance headroom to grow into as Android and apps and machine learning models get more complex.
 Speaking of, Samsung's high-powered hardware keeps all of the company's add-on software (and there is plenty of it here) from bogging down the standard Android 10 experience. The company's approach to software hasn't changed since we reviewed the Galaxy S20 Ultra, but in case you haven't tried a Samsung phone in a while, the OneUI interface has gotten steadily better and cleaner over time. But that's not to say all of Samsung's custom software additions work the way they should.
 The default Samsung keyboard sometimes failed to load when I tapped on a text field, which made sending emails and messages difficult.

 The coronavirus pandemic forced Democrats to turn their plans for a four-day party in Milwaukee into a two-hour-a-night event made for TV that's being broadcast this week from studios across the country.
 The night started slowly, highlighting individual Americans across the country hurt by the pandemic and Trump's politics and policies. It included interludes designed to highlight the character of the party's choice to take on Trump, former Vice President Joe Biden \-- such as a short panel discussion led by Biden on racial justice and a video of his relationships with Amtrak workers.

El Tribunal Supremo de Puerto Rico anunció que la Reválida General de Derecho se ofrecerá en un solo día, el 17 de septiembre, mientras que la Reválida Notarial se ofrecerá el 18 de septiembre, ante la emergencia por el Covid-19.
 La Junta Examinadora de Aspirantes al Ejercicio de la Abogacía y Notaría administrará ambas reválidas en varias instalaciones del Distrito de Convenciones.
 La Reválida General se acortará a un día y constará de 92 preguntas de selección múltiple administradas durante la mañana y cuatro preguntas tipo ensayo en la tarde, cubriendo las 13 materias previamente informadas por la Junta Examinadora. La Reválida Notarial se administrará durante la mañana del día siguiente.
 Para aquellos aspirantes que no puedan o no deseen tomar el examen de septiembre, el Tribunal Supremo determinó mediante una resolución que podrán solicitar admisión para practicar la abogacía de forma supervisada y temporal, hasta que la Junta Examinadora ofrezca el próximo examen.
 Los aspirantes que decidan posponer la toma del examen deberan informarlo en o antes del lunes, 24 de agosto a traves del correo electronico junta.examinadora@ramajudicial.pr y podran solicitar que los derechos de admision pagados para esta revalida se adjudiquen para el proximo examen.
 Entre las medidas y protocolos que se adoptaron en consulta con varios epidemiólogos para una administración segura de los exámenes se encuentra la entrada de los aspirantes al lugar donde se administrará la reválida por grupos y en horarios escalonados y la toma de su temperatura corporal. La información sobre el salón específico asignado, la hora de entrada y comienzo del examen será remitida oportunamente por correo electrónico a cada aspirante.
 Tan pronto ingrese a las instalaciones del lugar del examen, el aspirante se dirigirá directamente y sin dilación al salón designado y se ubicará en la mesa identificada con su número de asiento. Cada aspirante estará ubicado solo en una mesa, separado por una distancia de 6 pies o más de las personas a su alrededor. Todos los espacios estarán marcados para asegurar el distanciamiento físico.
 Habrá estaciones con desinfectante de manos disponibles en puntos estratégicos dentro de las sedes del examen y se exhortará a los aspirantes a lavarse las manos con agua y jabón frecuentemente y a utilizar desinfectante de manos entre estos lavados. Como medida adicional, se ofrecerá almuerzo en el lugar del examen para evitar la entrada y salida de personas.
 Todo aspirante que decida tomar las reválidas en septiembre deberá llevar mascarilla tipo quirúrgica —sin válvulas— la cual usará el día del examen en todo momento sobre la nariz y la boca. Aquellos aspirantes que interesen llevar además un protector de cara (face shield), podrán hacerlo.
 Si algún aspirante viajara a Puerto Rico para tomar el examen, deberá presentar evidencia de que lleva en esta jurisdicción 14 días o más anteriores a la fecha de las reválidas. En su defecto, el aspirante deberá presentar copia de resultado negativo a una prueba para detectar Covid-19 administrada posterior a haber viajado a Puerto Rico.
 El Supremo indicó que le corresponderá a todo aspirante familiarizarse con las guías de los Centros para el Control y la Prevención de Enfermedades (CDC, en inglés) sobre las mejores prácticas para protegerse a sí mismos y a otros del Covid-19. Igualmente tiene la responsabilidad de evitar cualquier evento que aumente su posibilidad de contagio y a estar muy atentos a la presencia de síntomas relacionados al Covid-19.
 Además, deberá completar y firmar un formulario donde lo certifica y remitirlo al personal de la Rama Judicial el día del examen. El mismo está disponible en el portal de la Rama Judicial.
 En cuanto al personal de la Rama Judicial, se le tomará la temperatura a todo el que labore en la administración de las reválidas. Asimismo, utilizarán mascarilla en todo momento. El personal que trabajará directamente con los aspirantes y con el manejo de los materiales de las reválidas utilizará ademas protector de cara (face shield). Igualmente, se aumentarán las medidas de limpieza y desinfección del área de examen y las áreas de uso público.

Curbside dining has been a lifeline for bars and restaurants that lost revenue and furloughed employees during the spring shutdown. Restaurants uptown already equipped with alfresco seating — like Harlem Tavern, on Frederick Douglass Boulevard, or Lido, the Italian restaurant up the block — hit the ground running. Beloved soul-food spots like Sylvia’s and Melba’s are having to learn to adapt. It hasn’t all gone smoothly. Scores of bars have had their liquor licenses suspended for a battery of colorful violations, from infractions as light as neglecting to sell sandwiches to patrons ordering drinks to more flagrant offenses. One particularly juicy dispatch accused the Fordham-area bar Tequila Sunrise of hosting a crowd of 150 revelers smoking hookah and playing music outside after hours on a weeknight.

So, yes, the Note 20 Ultra will probably peek conspicuously out of your pocket. Samsung made up for this by giving the Ultra one of the nicest screens I've _ever_ seen on a smartphone. This HDR10+ certified display produces deep blacks and vivid colors right out of the box, but persnickety types can dive into the settings and tune the screen's color temperature just the way they like it. Most people won't need to bother, though -- there's a decent chance this will be the nicest screen in your home. It certainly is in mine.
 You can also dial this display up to a maximum resolution of 3088x1440, but there's still plenty of detail to be found when left running at the default 2316x1080. I'm all for choice, but you'll probably want to leave the phone at the default resolution since it can ramp its refresh rate up to 120Hz when needed. Emphasis on "when needed." Rather than keep it cranked all the time and risk burning through the battery, the Note 20 Ultra uses a new display backplane that can dynamically change the refresh rate depending on what you're doing. If you're playing a supported game or swiping through your recent apps? Expect the full, buttery smooth 120Hz experience. If you're reading, though, or reviewing individual photos, the refresh rate can dip as low as 10Hz, which Samsung claims can lead to significant power savings. In other words, this screen is as clever as it is pretty.

 Therefore, the practice will likely continue unless prosecutors suddenly find their backbones and put some officials in jail for misappropriation of public funds.

Cameron Brady visited Ole Miss in the spring before COVID-19 shut recruiting -- and everything else -- down.
 He committed to UCF a few months later. Now, he’s flipped to the Ole Miss Rebels.
 The Knights did a fantastic job in the early-going, but offensive coordinator Jeff Lebby, safeties coach and Texas native Blake Gideon and wide receivers coach Derrick Nix all did an even better job, continuing to recruit Brady and eventually flip him to Ole Miss. The Lamar, Texas, native flew under the radar as a junior but was beginning to gain a ton of traction on the recruiting trail this spring, adding notable offers from Arkansas, Houston, Kansas, North Texas and UTSA.
 All staffs are more than capable of recognizing and bringing in talent. Kendal Briles at Arkansas knows offense and can certainly sift through receiver boards to find play makers. Dana Holgorsen at Houston has been doing it for years as well. Les Miles and company in Lawrence, and Seth Littrell airs it out in Denton.
 So if they think Brady is up to snuff, then Lane Kiffin is on to something. The Texan has family In Greenville, Miss., and proximity certainly played a factor when comparing playing in Oxford, Miss., versus Orlando, Fla.

The volunteers record every tent and lean-to they see as well as every car, van or RV they deem to be occupied. They do not attempt to determine the number of people sharing those dwellings. That’s USC’s job.
 The USC data team conducts a survey of about 4,000 homeless people across the county to learn the demographics of homelessness and to estimate how many people, on average, live in each type of dwelling. This year, for example, the survey found that 1.484 people, on average, occupied tents, 1.702 were in RV/campers and so on.
 Because those numbers are based on a sample — even though an unusually large one — they are subject to statistical error, a fact that LAHSA has never acknowledged in its annual presentations, which report an exact number of how many people were “counted.”
 Behind the scenes, USC’s Data Core, which won the homeless contract in 2017, has worked diligently to refine and improve an endeavor that, by its nature, cannot achieve perfect accuracy. USC’s statisticians have tracked down errors and tweaked their methodology without paying a lot of attention to how the changes might be perceived.

 While officers found that none of the bars exceeded capacity requirements, many of those inside were not wearing masks or face coverings as required by state emergency guidelines, Tuscaloosa police said.
   
 In all, officers issued 12 citations for mask violations and four people were arrested on seven charges.
   
 No ages or names were released, but one man was charged with obstruction of justice as officers attempted to issue a mask citation.
   
 Two other suspects who refused to sign citations were arrested for mask violation - one of whom also was charged with disorderly conduct and resisting arrest - and a young woman was charged with obstruction of justice and public intoxication after she became involved in one of the arrests, police said.
   
 Tuscaloosa police spokeswoman Stephanie Taylor said officers will continue to patrol the Strip and downtown bar areas to enforce the mask regulations for as long as they are in effect.
   
 While the City Council approved its own mask requirements on June 30, it was superseded two weeks later by a statewide mask order that is now set to expire Aug. 31.
   
 The outcry led some business owners to publicly defend their establishments against the growing waves of criticism.
   
 "It is not my responsibility to police people 50 yards from the entrance to my front door on city property," said Jeff Sirkin, owner of Gallettes, a popular hangout for the college-aged crowd, in a Facebook post. "Logistically it is impossible for me enforce you wearing a mask down the street while you wait to come inside. …
   
 "Our industry is not the fall guy for any of this. 25,000-30,000 students showed up this weekend. Did you expect them to sit at home and read? We are doing all we can."
   
 The mayor said Monday that his frustration this weekend stemmed from the acts of a few posing a threat to the sacrifices of many who are working to stem and slow the coronavirus spread.
   
 Recent data shows that COVID-19 related deaths at DCH Health System hospitals and new cases of infection are both on a downward trend, something that can continue with adequate social distancing and precautionary measures, he said.
   
 "It's our citizens' responsibility to do everything possible - wear a mask, social distance - and that will help all of us get through," Maddox said. "We will never enforce our way to solving this. Never."
   
 And with few to no violations being found inside establishments, further discussions are planned with bar and restaurant business owners in areas near downtown Tuscaloosa and The Strip to find ways to help ensure compliance with social distancing regulations outside these venues.
   
 Despite what may be some initial resistance, based on opinions like Sirkin's, one possible idea Maddox mentioned is having business owners help monitor the sidewalks and public rights-of-way outside their establishments because, the mayor said, they may have greater influence on their patrons than a cop.
   
 "I am so uneasy about all of this, about putting our law enforcement officers in these confrontational situations," Maddox said. "We need voluntary compliance as much as possible.
   
 "We are trying to save lives (and) we are trying to save this economy."

6% of children are not expected to return to school this September due to concerns surrounding coronavirus which, if applied to the wider population equates to approximately 540,000 children. Health concerns over coronavirus made up the primary reasons for non-attendance. The most common reason given was the risk of a healthy child contracting coronavirus and becoming ill, with the second-most common reason being the risk of a household member catching coronavirus from the child. As mentioned previously, mental health challenges that have emerged or grown during the pandemic, such as anxiety, were also cited as a reason for not returning to school, equating to a third of these cases.

Think of the WH-XB900N as the similar but cheaper alternative to the WH-1000XM3 (which is now slightly outdated as the WH-1000XM4s have arrived). That means you'll get a similar experience for less money, but that demands some sacrifices. The WH-XB900N, which we gave a score of 83, have a similar design to their higher-end counterparts and are just as comfortable to wear for hours on end. Sound quality is great, but since this is part of Sony's Extra Bass line, you'll notice the bass-heavy tuning immediately. That's not a bad thing if you prefer your music to have that extra _umph_ at all times, but if you're looking for a more balanced sound overall, you'll find it in the higher-end models.
 Active noise-cancellation is also solid on the WH-XB900N, but it's not quite as powerful as on the higher-end headphones. That's mostly due to the lack of QN1 chip in the WH-XB900N, but you'll still be able to block out most noise around you when you're in a coffee shop or on a plane.
 The WH-XB900N also have touch controls, a "quick-attention mode" that lowers the volume when you need to speak and they are compatible with both Amazon's Alexa and the Google Assistant. We also appreciate that the WH-XB900N have up to 30 hours of battery life, although make sure you charge them up before a long trip as they take a full seven hours to charge completely.
 All of those things make the WH-XB900N a great pair of wireless ANC headphones that won't break the bank -- especially today at this $148 sale price. If you're not willing to compromise on sound or ANC quality, and like the extra features that come with high-end headphones, Sony's new WH-1000XM4, the new versions of the WH-1000XM3, are officially available today for $350.

Wheat seed sales volumes were 56.5 percent higher than prior year on the back of improved irrigation capacity which benefited from rising water levels and better electricity supply. In addition, the government’s commitment to reduce imports by supporting local production of the crop contributed to the positive sales performance, the company said.
