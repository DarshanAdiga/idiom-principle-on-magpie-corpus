CHAUMONT, N.Y. (WWNY) - Villagers don’t want Chaumont to dissolve into the town of Lyme. Tuesday night’s election results surprised people on both sides of the issue.A sign has been outside Martin Jones' Chaumont home since October. It urged people to vote against dissolving the village.Now that Election Day is over and the results are in, Jones updated the sign.“It says, ‘Yay, we won,’” he said.As of Wednesday morning, the vote is 136 to 119 against the dissolution plan.Jones says he’s surprised that many people voted in favor of Chaumont dissolving into the town of Lyme, but he can relax knowing it’s not happening.“It’s like taking a weight off yourself,” he said.Village Mayor Valerie Rust says she’s surprised by the results too, just not for the same reason.“I was surprised that it was turned down,” she said.Rust says one draw of dissolution would have been avoiding possible tax increases on village residents. But, now that Chaumont will remain a village, Jones says if taxes have to go up, that’s okay with him.“If the village needed more taxes to do their job, yeah, I’m willing to pay it, you bet,” he said.While Rust says taxes on village residents could go up, the village board is working to make sure it’s a minimal increase.“We’re going to continue working hard to try and make the village efficient without over-burdening the taxpayer,” she said.Rust says her job and two board trustee spots will open up next election and at this point she’s not planning to run for reelection.“We have been on it for a long time, many years. It’s time for new blood, new people to come in and take that place,” she said.Rust says even though the dissolution plan didn’t go through, she hopes the board can use parts of it to save the village money.Copyright 2020 WWNY.

Nevertheless, the myth still persists that the city's payroll is bloated with unnecessary patronage jobs and that we could save millions of dollars by terminating these people once and for all. Nothing could be further from the truth. City Hall is a bare bones operation.

Firefighters don't spend their shifts sleeping on cots and merely scrubbing engines and trucks. They're battling fires, pulling people from the Susquehanna River, inspecting gas leaks and supporting paramedics on many of their medical emergency runs. DPW workers brave the heat, the cold, and the coronavirus to pick-up yard waste, recycling and garbage. Make no mistake, if we cut jobs, we will have to cut services.

In the course of the current audit, all of the airport's service facilities relevant to passengers were closely examined. Particular attention was paid to the new services that have been added in recent years, such as the new lounges in Terminal 1, the redesigned arrivals area in Terminal 2, the security checkpoint in Terminal 2 that has been upgraded with innovative technology, the user-friendly online booking platform for parking customers, and Munich Airport's new website, which was launched in 2017.      The confirmation of the 5-Star status was also influenced by the extensive measures implemented at Munich Airport to protect against Corona infection in compliance with hygiene and cleaning regulations. For Edward Plaisted, CEO of Skytrax, Munich Airport has set new standards in the European airport landscape with the renewed confirmation of its seal of approval: "Munich Airport has not rested on its awards, but with many attractive innovations has ensured that passengers have an even more pleasant stay at Munich Airport. It is easy to see at this airport that the cooperation between all the partners on campus works perfectly well."      "This is a great and motivating signal in a difficult time," said Jost Lammers, CEO of Munich Airport. ”I consider it particularly remarkable that we were able to maintain our high standards despite the many restrictions imposed by the pandemic. The fact that we will remain a 5-star airport in the future strengthens our resolve to overcome the current crisis together as an airport community. Certainly there will be a time after the pandemic crisis and I am confident that our hub will then be able to build on the successes of previous years."      Of the seven international airports that have been awarded the 5-Star Airport seal of approval, Munich is still the only European airport and, together with Doha, Hong Kong, Seoul, Shanghai, Singapore and Tokyo Haneda, Munich Airport ranks in the world's top group of airports.

Being an educated young man, Shafi was always dissatisfied with the age-old way of farming and dismayed at the declining harvest of rice crop in his area. He could not continue cultivating such low-yielding crop with outdated methods in his six kanals of land. So he went and bought high-density m-9 roots apple variety from Shimla and set about grooming his orchard. It was a time when he was alone in this attempt and all the people were skeptical and did not approve of his idea. Despite the odds, Shafi went to work and within two years, since 2018, he proved himself right, surprising everyone with a bumper produce of high-quality gala apples that sold like hot cakes at high rates round the year.
