“Been Around the World,” the opulent 1997 Puff Daddy track featuring Mase and the Notorious B.I.G. that opens the documentary, perfectly captures the cultural glamour the Bulls had attained by the late ’90s. A montage of Jordan’s 63-point playoff game against the 1985-86 Boston Celtics is perfectly synchronized to the booming percussion and braggadocious rapping of LL Cool J’s “I’m Bad” — marvel at how Jordan eyes the opening tipoff as LL’s voice builds in pitch and intensity.
 “I was blown away,” LL Cool J said of the sync in an interview. “I’m not just saying that because it’s my song, either — I just thought it worked.”
 Rudy Chung, the music supervisor of the series, said the filmmakers considered incorporating contemporary music, “But I think we pretty quickly realized that the best thing was to tell the story with songs from the era.”
