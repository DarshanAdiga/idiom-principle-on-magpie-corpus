Bartenders have relished the "phenomenal" feeling of pouring a beer into a glass pint and diners have embraced a glimmer of normality as NSW restaurants and bars reopened after an easing of COVID-19 restrictions.
 The state's restaurants, cafes, pubs and clubs are now able to have up to 10 patrons if they maintain social distancing after the NSW government wound back several restrictions from Friday.
 Premier Gladys Berejiklian has warned COVID-19 case numbers will inevitably rise as rules are eased, but punters on Friday seemed comfortable returning to their favourite bars and eateries.
 In Sydney's inner west, Shannah Baichoo was among the first to return to popular Summer Hill bar The Rio, resuming what was once a regular Friday night ritual with her husband.
 "It's like a signifier of life becoming normal again. It feels amazing," Ms Baichoo told AAP.
 Nearby, Lisa Polsek said visiting the bar offered a bit of normality but "baby steps" were important.
 "The worst thing would be is if we all have to go back again," she said.
 For The Rio's operational manager Fabrizio Culici, pouring his first beer into a glass pint felt "phenomenal" after weeks of take-aways and deliveries.
 "The sense of relief is just fantastic," Mr Culici said.
 "We just hope ... that this is certainly not going to be a short-lived thing and we go back to deliveries, because it's going to be very hard to survive if that happens."
 A couple of doors down at The Temperance Society, co-owner Alex Fensham shared similar concerns about having to wind back again.
 He welcomed having people back at the bar but said they were "pretty nervous" about opening trade for just 10.
 "It took an enormous shift and it actually cost us a lot of money to shift at short notice from being a bar to a take-away," Mr Fensham told AAP.
 "We're all feeling pretty happy to have people in here now, but whether it actually works out financially, I don't know yet. It's worth a shot."
 Under eased restrictions, outdoor gatherings of up to 10 people are now permitted and up to five people, including children, can visit another NSW household.
 Religious gatherings and places of worship can welcome up to 10 people, and 10 guests are also allowed at weddings, 20 at indoor funerals and 30 at outdoor funerals from Friday.
 Outdoor equipment including gyms and playgrounds can now be used with caution, with people encouraged to wipe down the equipment, while outdoor pools are open with restrictions.

Looming in the background is an economy decimated by the pandemic. Nearly 3 million laid-off U.S. workers applied for unemployment benefits last week, raising the total seeking aid in the past two months to about 36 million. Although some states have begun to let selected businesses reopen, workers are still reporting difficulty getting unemployment benefits. Freelance, gig and self-employed workers are struggling.
 Even the auto sector won't see a full return to normal yet, and if people don't start buying vehicles again, workers could be sent home. Yet automakers say there's enough pent-up demand, especially for pickup trucks, to get factories humming again.
 That could help states slow the drain on their unemployment benefit funds. In Michigan, where over one-third of the labor force sought benefits, the fund fell from $4.6 billion before the pandemic to $4.1 billion on April 30, said Jeff Donofrio, director of the state Department of Labor and Economic Opportunity. Some returning auto employees could work part-time and get still some unemployment benefits, but federal programs could cover part of their payments, he said.
 At Ford, where about 47,000 U.S. factory workers will return by next week, there's optimism that consumer demand will accompany them. Chief Operating Officer Jim Farley said the company has seen sales start to recover.
 Ford is predicting stronger sales in the future in Europe, China and the U.S. based on data collected from new models equipped with internet modems that show the number of times an engine is turned on and off. The company found a correlation between the number of trips people take and auto sales, with trips increasing as restrictions eased.
 "We started to see in early April a change where people started to take more trips," Farley said Thursday. "The (sales) decline stopped and our retail sales improved a lot."
 Auto sales in China, where the virus peaked before the U.S., could be a harbinger of things to come. China sales fell just 2.6% in April from a year earlier, compared with a 48% free-fall in March. Production at many plants is nearly back to normal after being shut down in January and February. Volkswagen, Honda, Mercedes and Ford reported no virus cases among employees since reopening. Fiat Chrysler had two, but said the workers never entered factories.
 Things are worse in Europe, where sales plummeted 55% in March and some factories are running at only 40% of capacity. The pandemic has affected over 1.1 million European auto industry workers, almost half the sector's manufacturing jobs. Most are getting paid through government support. A survey of auto parts suppliers shows that a third of executives believe it will take at least two years for the industry to recover.
 U.S. sales fell 46% in April compared with a year ago, but analysts are forecasting a smaller decline of 30% in May. Sales have been juiced by incentives, with offers of 0% financing for seven years.

HORRY COUNTY, S.C. (WMBF) – During the coronavirus pandemic, the S.C. National Guard was on a mission to make sure students were being fed, while also putting a smile on their faces by giving out books.U.S. Army Warrant Officer James Hughes with the 117th Engineer Brigade said they came to Horry County about three weeks ago where they took over to help Horry County Schools distribute meals to students.They would pick up food from school cafeterias in the morning and would establish pick-up sites for parents and children to pick-up meals.During the operations, the guardsmen found out that the libraries have programs where they recycle books in order to make room for new ones. So instead of throwing out the books, they decided to hand those books out to children who come by and get meals.“What we decided is to actually hand out the books to the children that come by and get a meal. So some of the books are part of their summer reading program that they were unable to distribute because of COVID-19 and then some of the books are older books that they were going to discard anyway,” Hughes said.He added that most of the time, the kids are more excited to see the books than the meals.Hughes said it’s missions like these are the reason he joined the National Guard.“It’s really rewarding to all of us. Morale is very high, we’re really excited every morning, everybody’s smiling, anxious to get to work every day to see some of the same kids, but this is why you join the National Guard,” Hughes said.

Australians will get to sit in pubs, cafes and restaurants for the first time in weeks, but authorities warn unwashed hands and crowding could bring it all to a halt.
 COVID-19 cases at two McDonald's restaurants and a shopping centre in Melbourne, and a Queensland nursing home, show the virus is far from defeated, despite there only being 50 Australians battling it in hospital.
 Prime Minister Scott Morrison says the health and economic supports are in place to start easing restrictions.
 "Now the task is to really build that confidence and to get that momentum going as we move to the next challenge, which is to reset the Australian economy for growth and to support Australians and their livelihoods well into the future."
 Fewer than 700 Australians still have the virus out of 7019 cases, with the number of new cases hovering at 20 a day.
 Chief medical officer Brendan Murphy says while there is a low level of the virus in the community, Australians still needed to be careful with their health and hygiene.
 States and territories have begun the first stage of a three-stage process to lift restrictions on outdoor and indoor gatherings and business operations.
 Mr Morrison acknowledged some businesses would not be profitable having only 10 customers at a time.
 "I want to commend them for that brave step that they're taking this weekend. Good on you for reopening."
 National leaders are also talking up the prospect of domestic tourism restarting, as part of the next phase of waking up the economy.
 The Australian Airports Association and Airlines for Australia & New Zealand convened a meeting of stakeholders this week to map out the industry's recovery.
 "As these restrictions are eased in line with the government's three-step framework, the safe resumption of domestic travel is a goal shared by all in the travel and tourism sectors," the AAA's acting chief Simon Bourke said.
 Many parents will be preparing this weekend for their children to return to classrooms.
 Hospitals have also been given the green light for elective surgery, which will be brought back on stream over three stages according to varying state and territory timetables.
 Mental health has not been ignored, with a $48.1 million response plan set to roll out in coming months, including research and support services.

Pickup trucks are giving automakers the most hope, said Jeff Schuster, senior vice president at LMC Automotive, a consulting firm. From January through April, total auto sales were down 21%, but pickups were only off 4%, he said.
 Yet Schuster says automakers could be a little too optimistic. "Those consumers who are still unemployed are not likely to be making auto purchases," he said.
 Some U.S. automakers, like General Motors, are restarting slowly, only bringing back workers on one shift in factories, some of which ran around the clock before the pandemic. Others, like Subaru in Indiana, have a full complement of employees.
 Although companies are taking precautions, one big virus outbreak at an auto plant could send the industry back into hibernation. And the industry could face parts supply interruptions from Mexico, where the government wants to reopen factories despite rising virus cases.
 Automakers in the U.S. are requiring employees to fill out questionnaires daily to see if they have symptoms, taking temperatures with no-touch thermometers before workers enter buildings, and requiring gloves, masks and face shields. They've also tried to keep at least six feet between workers, staggered time between shifts so workers don't interact, and put up plexiglas barriers when possible.
 All the steps were tested on U.S. workers who volunteered to make protective gear and breathing machines while they were laid off. Automakers say they know of no virus cases among workers in the effort.
 But Phil Cuthbertson a worker at GM's transmission plant in Toledo, Ohio, who will return Monday, said he has mixed feelings.
 "I just don't want the whole thing to be pushed on us to go back if it's not safe," he said.
 Cindy Estrada, United Auto Workers vice president for Fiat Chrysler, said she's been impressed by the companies' safety commitment. But she's sure some workers, especially in the hard-hit Detroit area, will be fearful because family members or co-workers have had COVID-19. At least 25 UAW members employed by Detroit automakers have died from the virus, although no one is sure if they caught it at a factory.
 The union will be watching in case workers get infected, though there's no magic number for when it will try to close a factory, Estrada said.
 "If something looks like it's becoming a hot spot, then we need to act quickly and make adjustments," she said. "No one wants to see that happen."

Dr. Daniel Lewis, chief medical officer for Greeneville Community Hospital, practicing physician and COVID-19 survivor, believes that a vaccine against the virus will be developed … but probably it will take some time.
 In a Greeneville Sun interview this week with the local physician, who practices family medicine and sports medicine with Ballad Health Medical Associates, Lewis commented on several matters that are now part of an international conversation about COVID-19.
 Asked if a COVID-19 vaccine might prove as elusive as a vaccine against HIV has been (no such vaccine yet exists after decades of effort) Lewis expressed tempered optimism.
 “There are different types of viruses in regards to genetic material. Coronavirus is an RNA virus, and we have successfully developed these (vaccines) in the past, and they are generally safer and more efficacious,” he said. “While HIV also is an RNA virus, the body’s response to this infection is totally different than most infections, hence a lack of immune response for HIV vaccine attempts.”
 For coronaviruses, though, a “vehicle for carrying coronaviruses” already exists, he said. “I think these efforts will be successful, but will probably require several months to a year to develop and fully test.”
 Asked about the current pace of “reopening” businesses and economic activity in light of the likelihood of COVID-19 lingering for weeks or months longer, he replied, “I understand the importance of reopening local businesses, and I think that it is appropriate. I feel like the proper steps and timing are being recommended for restaurants, etc. I do think that wearing a mask is appropriate … wearing a mask and proper hand hygiene are the best steps we can take to prevent the spread of COVID.”
 He added, “It is thought that, if 80 percent of the population would wear a cloth mask, which is thought to be 60 percent effective, we can reduce the transmission of COVID to less than one case of spread per infected person, and the virus will burn out. When I’ve been out, however, typically less than half of the people I see are wearing a mask.”
 Lewis suspects a “new normal” that includes masks, distancing and hygienic practices is going to endure for a good while, “at least until we have a widely available vaccine.”
 Even after that, he hopes to see practices such as pre-disinfection of shopping carts and regular hand-washing to continue, as these can help deter other diseases such as colds and flu along with COVID-19.
 It even is possible that masks could become prevalent in a lasting way, as they have in China due to other diseases.
 “I do think we will continue with some modifications of our routine activities or quite a while, if not permanently,” he said.
 Does he consider himself now immune from COVID-19?
 “I have had an antibody test that shows I have antibodies against coronavirus; I don’t have specifics about the validity of the test, as it was a trial I participated in, and there is some concern about cross-reactivity with antibodies against the more common coronaviruses (four of which are known to cause URI and colds),” he said. “The other coronaviruses present at least a transient degree of immunity. Most of the reported cases of ‘re-infection’ seem to be secondary to sampling error or inexact testing.”
 He continued: “My belief is I have some degree of immunity, which I hope is permanent, and I do believe we can and will develop a ‘herd immunity’ over time. However, given its ‘newness,’ this will take months to develop, and the exact costs in terms of death, etc., are unknown.”
 Lewis is limiting his work hours and spending time building up muscle he lost during his hospitalization. He estimated that his strength level diminished upwards of 30 percent.
 He sees the experience of dealing with the pandemic as probably being good, in some ways, for local and regional health care systems.
 Ballad Health’s response to the coronavirus situation has been “robust and stronger” than might have been the case with “two competing health care systems in the region as we previously had.”
 Rebounding for Ballad, though, will have some challenges, he said. “I do think that Ballad, like many other health care systems, will face some short-term challenges, given the expense and loss in revenue that comes with limiting surgery, etc.” but ultimately “we will come through this situation stronger and more capable.”

The idea is to use the considerable influence of board members, and a quickly designed website, to raise money for front-line care givers.
 Although a variety of recipients could qualify for the funds, Bergstresser said the group is targeting Boston EMS, the city's ambulance service, and Boston Medical Center, a safety-net hospital that serves the city's poor.
 Norman Stein, the chief development officer at BMC, said the funds are arriving just in time and are likely to be used for a variety of items that don't normally pop up on the hospital's budget.
 For instance, the hospital is housing nearly 140 staffers at a nearby Hampton Inn so they can be sure they won't infect family members with the novel coronavirus. The staffers run the professional gamut, from doctors and nurses to maintenance workers, dietitians and medical technicians. And they have been staying at the inn anywhere from two to 50 nights.
 "At the end of the day you really want to go home. But should you go home?" Stein asked. "If staffers decide they'd rather not, they can stay at the hotel."
 Another unexpected expense has been food and financial support for some of the 750 staffers, many of them low-wage earners, who were furloughed as the hospital stopped providing elective surgeries and other non-emergency procedures while gearing up for the rush of COVID-19 patients.

 If you haven't heard or read by now, the news for the Redwood Valley High School Class of 2020 seems to get better every day. (Please don't let my dripping sarcasm stain your shirt.)
 First they found out in March they would be spending much of their final days as seniors at home doing their classes from a distance. Then the governor announced the remainder of the school year would be done via distance learning.
 While some held out hope that schools would be allowed to host events like prom, they, too, ultimately were cancelled. That left a lot of young ladies holding dresses they had bought with nowhere to wear them. (By the way, if you would like to show off your prom dress, you can send a photo of you in it, and I will share it with the rest of the world.)
 While all of this was happening, a group of RVHS seniors had been meeting with school leadership to talk about the most important milestone of the year - graduation. Although not preferable, a plan was put in place that would allow the class to gather together one last time at Inglis Field for a ceremony.
 While grandmas and grandpas, as well as aunts, uncles and family friends, would not be able to witness the moment they walked across the stage, at least a few immediate loved ones would be able to be there to watch them celebrate in their red caps and gowns.
 Another and final shoe fell for the senior class when the Minnesota Department of Education offered its guidance on graduation ceremonies. In essence, the state education leaders told school districts that ceremonies of any type were not going to happen regardless if they were held indoors or outdoors or if the proper six-foot berth was being observed.
 So, when graduation day arrives at the end of this month, the Redwood Valley Class of 2020 will be seated inside of vehicles in the Redwood Valley school parking lot with proper distance between vehicles. (I am wondering if convertibles will be acceptable that day.)
 As the dad of a senior, I have heard a lot of the frustration from people as they talk about what this class has missed. Of course, my Amos has no interest in it at all. In fact, if he got his diploma in the mail he would be fine with that.
 I am more than a little sad in a selfish way as it relates to this year's seniors, because I am also missing out on enjoying the final events of their time in high school. I missed out on face- to-face interviews with several potential Student Rotarians, and won't get to attend their final band and choir concerts.
 I think the fact that I have to go through the rest of this school year knowing I have already heard those last performances hurts the most.
 I will miss talking with those who would have made it to the state speech tournament. There are so many great students in this class that I have gotten to know well.
 I have been there to witness all of it. I was there the day they started Kindergarten and the day they had their debut music performance.
 I witnessed their fourth-grade graduation and saw them as fifth graders when they played together in the PAC as a band for the first time.
 I watched them as they made their way to high school and saw them grow, mature and become young men and women.
 This is a great group of people, and I am confident they are going to do great things.
 The Class of 2020 will forever be known throughout history as the class who graduated during the COVID-19 pandemic. While I know that is the reality, I do not think it is a fair assessment of them.
 What I do believe about this senior class is it is the right group of students to face it. I can say without doubt that what this class has encountered in their final days at Redwood Valley will make them stronger.
 In the future, they will be a class that sees huge successes simply because they have learned how to overcome daunting obstacles. These will be the types of people we will want working for us in the future, because they will be problem solvers.
 The rest of us need to just get out of their way.
 My wish would be that every one of these students would come back to their hometown to work and raise their families, because they will be significant influences in whatever places they call home.
 A time will come in the future when we all look back on the Class of 2020 and see them for who they really are - the group that changed the world because they would not let a little thing like a pandemic change them.
