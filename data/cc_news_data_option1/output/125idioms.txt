There is no one right way to go about digital transformation. Each company is unique in terms of its size and culture, and how much experience it has with digital technologies. Companies that are particularly innovative tend to have appointed a chief digital officer, set up digital labs or incubators for startups, or actively go out and scout for technologies to drive digital transformation. Others stick to a zero-defect mentality.

Why Jan. 1? Again, why not? But, I’ll add, it’s true for Jan. 12, too, and Feb. 18, March 3 and so on. It’s any and every day; set intentions to be better.
 Concerned that you’re setting yourself up for failure? Rubbish. Recall Samuel Beckett’s words, “Ever tried. Ever failed. No matter. Try again. Fail again. Fail better.”
 George Clooney is credited with saying, “The only failure is to not try.” I like these failure-friendly phrases. If I resolve to exercise five days a week on average in 2020 but actually fall short of that, I probably would be better off than if I hadn’t made the resolution.
 Let’s say I keep it up for four weeks and then get a rotten head cold, my mother moves in, the dog dies and I fall off the wagon. I’d be derailed for a bit, sad as anything, and stressed out. I’d likely forget my ambitious, healthy resolution while I recalibrated, but then – there’s another day. Another opportunity to refresh and re-set my intention, my resolution.
 Maybe the problem with New Year’s resolutions is the word “year.” Maybe we should think in terms of new day resolutions, or, in some cases, new hour resolutions. Certain times of the day are harder for me to be the best version of myself than other times. Thus, periodically, when I have the presence of mind, I set an intention to be patient and flexible, or something else beneficial, during those tougher hours. Even if I lose my cool and “fail” at patience and flexibility with all the resulting stress and frustration therewith, the attempt to be better is worthwhile.
 Some people choose to be better, some don’t. One thing is certain, no one chooses for us. The absence of conscientious effort will leave us in different places.
 Personally, my awareness of where I’d be without mindful effort to work towards being the better versions of myself physically, intellectually and emotionally is enough to keep me working hard most of the time. I fully know the temptation of unlimited TV and Oreos. My intention and resolution today and each day moving forward is to keep moving forward. I’m eager to continually carve a life of dynamic engagement with interesting people making our world better.
 Whatever your goals are, and they’re very likely similar to years past, keep chomping away at them. Keep up the effort. There is no finish line. If you fail, fail better. Get up, keep going. It’s a new hour. See you out there.

PEORIA -- After the drenching rain, ice and snow will add more weather fun to the area as 2020's first big weather pattern will sock the area for another 24 hours.
 Heavy rain fell on central Illinois on Friday night, and it was expected to continue through mid-morning Saturday when the rain would switch over to ice. By Saturday night, that could switch over to snow.
 Expected are between two to three inches of snow for Peoria and up to a quarter inch of ice. But according to Ben Deubelbeiss, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service, it is still up in the air, so to speak, where the heaviest precipitation will fall.
 "One county over, west or east is going to make all the difference with this system," he said. "The state of the science is that we can pin things down to a county or two, having a high degree of accuracy. But within those counties, on the sub-county level, your accuracy is going to diminish."
 The area still remains under both a flood warning and a winter weather advisory through noon Saturday. That's when the flood watch drops off. The winter weather advisory continues through midnight Sunday.
 But while the extent of the storm isn't known, locals aren't taking chances. Peoria County has closed the State Street bridge in between Illinois Route 6 and East Carlar Court as that is a common place for flooding whenever there is heavy rain. The bridge will remain closed until the Peoria County Highway Department deems the area is safe from flooding conditions.
 The Illinois River could crest late next week, with the river stage approaching the moderate flooding level.
 Sie Maroon, the city's snow-fighting guru within the public works department, said crews are ready to hit the streets at 7 a.m. and will be on 12-hour shifts.
 "The ice is the element that causes a lot of issues," he said. And of course, there's the rain and the snow, too.
 "We'll have to adapt as there are so many variables. It's going to go from rain to ice to snow," Maroon said.
 The one hope is that temperatures continue to stay relatively warm, heating up the pavement and helping to melt the ice and the snow upon contact.
 The ice could also affect power lines and tree limbs. Maroon said a truck is loaded up with barricades just in case a road needs to be blocked off.
 Deubelbeiss gets the frustration. He knows all weather is loca,l and people want to know how it will affect them. But that's the challenge.
 "We know that a portion is going to six plus inches of snow. We know there is a corridor of freezing range. The challenge is to pinpoint where it is going to happen."

The risk of exposure to modern day slavery can have ominous consequences, aside from it being an atrocious crime against humanity that needs extinguishing. For businesses who are unprotected, infiltration could have repercussions such as reputational damage, loss of major clients, reduction in company value and at the worst, legal action. This makes developing a robust anti-slavery strategy an essential business priority. The sensible foundation to begin understanding the risks of slavery within any waste management organisation or even individual facility is to undertake a gap analysis to pinpoint areas of weakness that need immediate redress. It’s recommended to work with a partner with practical, organised crime prevention expertise who will leave no stone unturned, such as the experts at Slave-Free Alliance. This ensures the exercised is optimised and tailored to the intricacies of the particular organisation, which allows for the production of enhanced recommendations bespoke to an individual company rather than a generic checklist which may still leave exposed weaknesses.

 TRUMP’S STUNT
 Trump’s shameless attempt to get re-elected by ordering a drone strike in Iraq is already destabilizing the whole world. And I wouldn’t put it past Trump if he hopes that Americans actually do get killed because he thinks that will help him in his re-election bid. That is what kind of disgusting person Trump is. There’s no logical reason for him to order this joke strike. Obviously, he knew there was going to inflame tensions and that’s what he hopes because he knows he needs something monumental to get himself re-elected and he’s hoping this will do it. I only hope the American public can see through this ploy and recognized Trump for what he is, an absolutely despicable human being.
 TIME FOR PUNISHMENT
 It’s about time we struck back at the people who are killing Americans. When they kill Americans all we ever do is say if you do that again we’ll punish you. We never punish them. This time Trump punished them. A bully will never stop bullying unless he is punished. Good work, Mr. Trump. Don’t let them people push us around and get away with it.

Everyone on board died. They were students, newlyweds, doctors and parents. The youngest was a 1-year-old girl, Kurdia Molani, who was flying back home with her parents to the Toronto suburb of Ajax.
 By late Thursday, Western leaders said that Iran had most likely shot down the jetliner with a surface-to-air missile — probably by accident. The loss of so many lives transformed the U.S.-Iran confrontation, which had seemed to conclude with limited bloodshed.
 Instead, what had begun with a drone attack on Gen. Qassem Soleimani’s motorcade at the Baghdad airport had suddenly rippled outward until dozens of Iranian-Canadians, dozens of Iranian students studying in Canada, were dead.
 “The community is overwhelmed with mourning and sadness,” said Payman Parseyan, a prominent Iranian-Canadian in western Canada, counting through the names of the friends he had lost. There was Pedram Mousavi and his wife, Mojgan Daneshmand, both of them engineering professors, and their two daughters, Daria and Dorina Mousavi. There was Dr. Shekoufeh Choupannejad, an obstetrician-gynecologist, and her two daughters, Saba and Sara Saadat. It seemed impossible.
 Trump is deeply unpopular in Canada, and some here blamed him for creating the standoff that appeared to have led to the disaster.
 “A president, bruised by impeachment, orders a dramatic assassination, and five days later a plane lands in Toronto, with 138 empty seats, taxiing up to a terminal filled with sobbing loved ones,” Maclean’s magazine columnist Scott Gilmore wrote of the connecting flight that arrived in Canada almost empty.
 But Parseyan wasn’t so sure.
 “It takes two to tango,” he said. “It’s not hard to see the downing as a result of the escalation between the two countries. However, Iran is responsible for its own military defense equipment. While it has the right to defend itself, as it should to protect its own people, it should also have the responsibility with that right to make sure their defensive systems aren’t targeting civilian aircraft.”
 Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who has at times had a rocky relationship with Trump, was careful not to say the U.S. strike had lead to what happened in Tehran.
 “I think it is too soon to be drawing conclusions or assigning blame or responsibility in whatever proportions,” he told reporters. On Friday, he met privately with families of some of the victims.
 Even some who regularly criticize Trump said the White House couldn’t be held responsible.
 “Trump’s assassination of Soleimani may have been foolish and adventurist but I can’t see how he can be blamed in any way for the shooting down of the airline,” said Nelson Wiseman, a political science professor at the University of Toronto. “This sad incident speaks to the incompetence of and lack of discipline in the Iranian army.”
 Ukraine was also mourning: It lost two passengers and a crew of nine in the crash. For days, airline workers, relatives of victims and ordinary people have been bringing flowers to a makeshift memorial for the crew — nine framed portraits surrounded by candles — in the Kyiv airport.
 Vladyslav Perez, who was friends with a flight attendant killed in the crash, Ihor Matkov, said Matkov loved working in the air and was deeply proud of his job.
 “It’s unfair that such an amazing person passed so early in life,” he said. “I’m in shock that Iran hasn’t closed its airspace.”
 Many in Canada simply struggled to make sense of the disaster.
 “If something like this happened as an accident, it’s much easier to take in than when you hear that maybe it got shot,” said Nina Saeidpour, a Calgary real estate agent whose friend Kasra Saati was among the victims. “We’re just trying to figure out what happened.”

TORONTO • The worst had passed, it seemed, and the United States and Iran no longer appeared poised at the edge of war.
 “All is well!” President Donald Trump tweeted Tuesday night, days after a U.S. drone strike killed Iran’s most powerful general, and Iran, after a barrage of missiles, had signaled it was stepping back from further escalation.
 But 27 seconds before Trump’s tweet, commercial flight trackers had lost contact with a Ukrainian International Airlines jet that had just taken off from Tehran’s main airport. On board were 176 people, including 138 passengers on their way to Canada, at least 57 Canadian citizens and 11 Ukrainians. The plane, which never made a mayday call, slammed moments later into the ground.

To truly appreciate the grit and do-what-ever-it-takes determination Jack Knust brought to Grain Valley soccer, consider what he did one night on the football field.
 Knust was lining up a 32-yard field goal attempt during Grain Valley's Class 4 District 7 championship game against Harrisonville when a bad snap forced Gavin Oyler, his holder, to scramble and throw the ball. Riley Brown snagged Oyler's pass in the end zone as the first half ended, providing critical points in the Eagles' 32-21 victory.
 That probably wouldn't have happened if Knust hadn't leveled a Harrisonville lineman with a punishing block.
 "You could hear the pop," Grain Valley football coach David Allie said. "He popped the kid and allowed our holder to get the ball, scramble and throw a touchdown. He was a big part of that victory."
 From the time he was a freshman, when Grain Valley last went to the Class 3 state soccer final four, to his senior season, when the Eagles came achingly close to going again, Knust has been a big part of the Eagles' success. It's also the reason why he's The Examiner's 2019 Boys Soccer Player of the Year.
 Knust, a midfielder, finished the season with a team-leading 30 goals, just one shy of the school record, and 11 assists. That's a lot of goals for a midfielder and a big jump from the 14 he scored as a junior.
 "I didn't have any expectations at the beginning of the year for myself," Knust said. "I just knew that the team was going to be really good and I was going to do everything I could to make it happen."
 That attitude didn't surprise Grain Valley coach Ty Nichol, who knew Knust was special from the time he was a freshman. But even he didn't expect Knust to put that many balls in the net. An attacking midfielder like Knust usually is the guy setting up the forwards with assists. Nichol saw a bigger role for Knust, and he wanted Knust to know it was OK to score.
 "It took a lot of convincing him to be selfish," Nichol said. "You can take a player on on the dribble, beat him and go score yourself. It just took a lot of constant convincing of him that it's OK to take over games sometimes. There are times to be unselfish and there are times to be the player you can be and go score."
 Knust took that advice to heart as Grain Valley rolled through its 15-5-3 season. He also took it upon himself to be a leader on the Eagles' relatively young squad, and Nichol said he amply filled that role in his soft-spoken way.
 "He's not a real loud personality; he's a workhorse who's just a good person on and off the field," Nichol said. "The kids and players, they watch him and they follow him. If he does the right thing, they're more likely to do the right thing. If he puts in the extra effort in practice, they're going to put in the extra effort. That told the story of our team this year."
 That story included two penalty kicks in a 2-1 victory over Kansas City East in the Class 3 District 14 final. A 1-0 win on a frigid night in Belton set up a home match against Platte County in the state quarterfinals.
 Grain Valley lost that match 1-0 in overtime. Knust, who barely missed on a header in the first half, saw his final year end one win from a final four and one goal from a school record.
 "Especially right after the goal, just seeing it go in and thinking this is my last game and that it was over ... it kind of crushed me," Knust said. "I really felt like we were going to the final four. I was really confident in the team."
 While soccer has been a big part of Knust's life since preschool, football is something new. He played some when he was younger, but he never thought about playing in high school until Eagles quarterback Cole Keller and a couple of coaches broached the idea.
 "I thought it was a good opportunity because my dad and my uncles all played high school and even college football," Knust said. "I was like, why not?"
 Allie liked the idea because he knew he'd have a sure leg in Knust. He proved the coach right by making five of seven field goal attempts and converting 33 of 38 extra points. His longest field goal was a 42-yarder, and his two fourth-quarter kicks were the only points in a 6-3 win over Grandview in the Eagles' second game of the season.
 "He was a great kicker, but he was also a great kid," Allie said. "He does a great job in the classroom; he's yes sir, no sir, a great worker. The dual- sport, same-season athlete has to spend that extra time and he would do that."
 Nichol said that made it easier for him to share his star player.
 "It's tricky, but he never missed practice for us, even on Fridays when he had games he would still come to our practice first and then go to the game," Nichol said. "We let him leave one game early because there was a football game. (The score) at halftime wasn't very close so we let him jet and he made it to the football game just in time."
 But it's soccer that's in Knust's future, and right now he's considering offers from Truman State and Rockhurst University. Wherever he winds up, Nichol is certain Knust will work hard and find success.
 The hardest part for Nichol will be replacing him.
 "We've got good players obviously that will be hanging around with us next year," Nichol said. "But you don't replace a player like that overnight, that's for sure."

Consumers believe retailers have a responsibility to address social issues through their business practices, for example, through alternative, greener delivery options to same-day delivery, such as buy online pick up in-store (BOPIS). An increasing number of consumers also expect retailers to take an active role in waste reduction and offer recycling services. Retailers are hearing the call for more accountability and at the same time are facing increased competition to achieve faster fulfillment to customers. More companies are adopting a direct-to-consumer business model. Accordingly, these trends are putting pressure on businesses to adopt new strategies for their global supply chain.

Perhaps surprisingly, British nationals have recently become the most common nationality of UK slavery victims. This means additional diligence is required when training staff to spot the signs; for migrant workers, one of the typical signs is someone acting as an unofficial interpreter on their behalf, which wouldn’t be the case for a British victim. Upskilling staff to spot universal red flags is essential; some of the indicators are employees who are chaperoned to and from work, who don’t appear to be able to make deviations from this arrangement; physical signs such as malnourishment, injuries, bruising and medical conditions going untreated; psychological signs such as paranoia, fear, agitation, confusion or being extremely withdrawn. These clues all strongly point towards the possibility of enslavement. Modern slavery is a hidden crime, therefore it can be shocking to discover its scale within UK businesses, and there’s a lot that people don’t know, but it’s not something organisations can afford to turn a blind eye to. For those with little time and resource, it’s recommended that at the very least that facilities should look to provide awareness literature placed in visible locations throughout hight footfall employee touchpoints, in various languages for the best possible employee exposure. This should be accompanied with a confidential whistleblowing hotline which gives staff a safe, anonymous way to escalate any concerns. Gaining knowledge and awareness of the signs are some of the best preparatory skills on the slavery prevention journey.

Walmart shoppers love this handy little vacuum because of its reasonable price and programmable capabilities. In reviews, they praise how effective it is at picking up everything from candies to flour to large amounts of animal fur. Reviewers also note that because this model doesn't include boundary sensing technology, it can get stuck in tight places, but you can easily block off small areas before running the device.

Twitter’s street boxing analysts noted that the woman in black didn’t have her footing right nor did she keep her hands up properly as Green Tanktop did. But to be fair, the woman in black stood back up, a little wobbly no doubt, but still ready to get it on.

He said the Police Department is working with downtown and Fourth Avenue bars and restaurants to improve their security plans and to reinforce the importance of following the laws when it comes to serving alcohol. He said most businesses are cooperating with police in these efforts, but there are some establishments showing “poor management.”
 Police said establishments that continue to violate the state’s liquor laws could be subject to fines and to revocations of their liquor licenses and even consequences under the city’s red-tag ordinance, which cites establishments for “loud and unruly” disturbances such as drinking in public, serving alcohol to minors and fighting. The red-tag ordinance states businesses found responsible for an “unruly gathering” can be fined $500 for the first offense and $1,500 for the third and subsequent violations.

Kevin and Melinda Mays – the parents of former Georgia offensive lineman Cade Mays – are suing the University of Georgia after Kevin Mays’ right pinkie was severed by a folding chair during a recruiting visit on Dec. 15, 2017, according to a lawsuit filed by the Mays’.
 Former offensive line coach Sam Pittman then picked up the severed pinkie off the floor and placed it on ice, according to the lawsuit. Mays was transported to Piedmont Hospital in Athens in the moments following for treatment, where he was diagnosed with partial amputation.
 According to the lawsuit, Kevin Mays’ right hand experienced swelling, tenderness and decreased mobility. He is seeking damages for pain and suffering as well as a loss of labor.

 BESSEMER ACADEMY 41, RCA GIRLS 39
 The Lady Warriors led for much of the game before Bessemer Academy tied the game in the third quarter. From there, the game remained neck-and-neck before Bessemer Academy did just enough to come away with the two-point win Friday.
 “The thing I tell (my players) is, it’s not bad or good,” RCA girls coach William Knight said. “It’s one of those things you have to look at from both sides of the spectrum. … I tell them to let it sting for a little bit, and that’s OK, but come tomorrow, it’s a brand new day. I always tell them, we can either win, or we can learn, and (Friday) was an opportunity to learn.”

In 1999, when the nascent Hummer brand was beginning, GM originally planned on using the name for a GMC product before spinning it out into its own brand completely. That brand lived on until 2010 when it was shuttered with Pontiac and Saturn, post bankruptcy, where it stayed dormant until now.

Vermonters exposed to toxic chemicals by polluters may develop debilitating or deadly diseases that do not become symptomatic until long after exposure. It is critical to detect any disease that does develop as early as possible.
 This is done through medical monitoring, which includes screening and ongoing observation to detect the symptoms early of diseases linked to exposure to a toxic substance. It ensures that those harmed are referred for medical care at the earliest possible time, when effective treatment can improve outcomes.
 Last year, for the second time in two consecutive bienniums, the legislature passed a bill that would require companies that have wrongly exposed Vermonters to disease-causing toxic chemicals to pay for medical monitoring.
