To all intents and purposes, the opposition leader wants talks that will eventually see him command some key place on the governaning table. He has been playing hardball. He refused an invitation to become Leader of Opposition – an office that Mnangagwa mulled creating for Chamisa after the elections in 2018. He has spurned Polad. Yet, it is clear that the more he plays hardball, greater are his chances of not getting anything at all. Look at recent headlines in the national Press. They are telling us that Chamisa is warming up to Mbeki dialogue; etc, indicating that Chamisa identifies the last chance saloon that the Meki talks are.

Man Utd's 'rhythm' pleases Sir Alex Ferguson
 They dominated possession, looked solid at the back and always seemed to have an extra gear going forward.
 However, United had to overcome an early setback when sustained when he got his studs caught in the turf.
 Antonio Valencia was brought on in his place, with Nani pushed up front alongside Wayne Rooney, and Villa had no answer to the pace, movement and skill of the new-look front three.
 So it was no surprise when Jones put the visitors in front.
 Playing in midfield, the versatile 19-year-old timed his run into the box to perfection to confidently stroke home Nani's nicely-flighted cross.
 ## Did you know?
 The attendance of 40,053 was the highest at Villa Park this season
 The chances kept coming with Given making a good save from Nani's header and Valencia's 35-yard shot sailing just over as United tried to turn the screw.
 The game's injury jinx struck again when Given was taken off with a hamstring injury as the problems piled up for the shot-shy Villans.
 After being booed off at half-time, the hosts were brighter in the second half and Emile Heskey should have done better when he headed over the bar from three yards out after Richard Dunne had steered the ball towards goal from a corner.
 It was a poor finish, symptomatic of the problems faced by the Midlanders since the goals have dried up in recent weeks.
 Alex McLeish left winger Charles N'Zogbia out of his starting line-up because of a breach of club discipline, but the home side could have done with the sort of spark their £9.5m summer signing can provide.
 There was plenty of industry from Barry Bannan, Marc Albrighton and Jenas, but very little in the way of flair.

 The men were not badly hurt, and the suspect is being sought.
 Commissioner Shea promised detectives would find the pugilistic pipe pounder.
 “I want to reiterate what I’ve said many times before: an attack on any member of the New York City Police Department is an attack on society, and must be denounced by all New Yorkers,” Shea said. “Respect is a two-way street.

Tuesday's rare confluence of announcements puts awards season into hyper speed. The Academy Awards moved up several weeks to Feb. 9 this year, squeezing the pre-Oscars calendar. The British Academy Film Awards also unveiled their nominations Tuesday, with “Joker” leading all films with 11 nods and an all-white acting field that immediately sparked criticism.
 Oscar prognosticators pay particular attention to the Producers Guild, which selects 10 movies for the year. Aside from the above five films, the producers also nominated “Joker,” “Marriage Story,” “Knives Out,” “Little Women” and “Ford v Ferrari" for its annual top prize, the Darryl F. Zanuck Award.
 Producers Guild Awards, now in its 31st year, have a history of forecasting the Academy Awards. In 21 out of the last 30 years, the PGA winner has corresponded with the Academy Awards best picture winner, including the last two years: “Green Book” in 2019, “The Shape of Water” in 2018.
 Notably missing out Tuesday were “The Farewell,” “Bombshell” and “The Two Popes.” There chances for a best-picture nomination aren't necessarily over, but seldom does more than one film overlooked by the Producers Guild make it into the Oscar field.
 The Directors Guild is also a prominent Oscars predictor. Since 1948, only seven times has the DGA winner not gone on to take the directing Academy Award. Last year, Alfonso Cuaron won at the DGA Awards before winning the Oscar, too.
 In its 71-year history, the Directors Guild has only nominated eight women for best director. The last was Greta Gerwig in 2018 for “Lady Bird,” but she didn't make the cut this year for “Little Women.”
 While female filmmakers had a historic year at the box office in 2019, they have been largely on the outside this awards season. The Globes didn't nominate a woman for best director, or select a female-directed movie for its 10 best picture nominees.

It was only four months ago that a gray fox made a bee line toward Norman Kenney outside his home in Maine. The 88-year old stomped it to death.
 Then, early Friday evening, just home from the store, Kenney closed his garage door. He heard a mew sound, and thought it was his cat. "Come on April, let's go," he said he called out.
 But the animal was another fox, and it charged at him, biting his face and hands, knocked him to the driveway and sent his glasses tumbling.
 So what is it about Kenney that fills the common fox with frothy rage?
 "I wish I knew," he told The Washington Post by phone on Tuesday, shortly before officials said the fox in last week's attack tested positive for rabies.
 In this attack, the fox gave more fight than the other, he said. The former fire chief, a stout 200 pounds, wrestled the animal for at least 12 minutes, he said. Kenney had a folding cane, but it collapsed with each blow, eroding into a clunky weapon that only agitated the fox, which he estimated was about 30 pounds.
 Kenney gave up the cane and grabbed the fox by his throat. His hands wandered for the shape of his windpipe and bared down. The fox struggled, and under Kenney's thrashed hands, he felt pulsating blood under the coat.
 "I knew I wasn't squeezing hard enough," Kenney said.
 Both the fox and Kenney were struggling to breathe. A neighbor, out for a jog, came upon the scene, Kenney said, and he advised the teenager to put his foot on the animal's neck - similar to what Kenney himself did in his first attack.
 He handed the teen his cellphone, dripping with blood that obscured the keypad, Kenney said, but the neighbor managed to call the police. Kenney was being loaded onto the ambulance when three shots from a police .22-caliber rifle rang out, he said. The fox was dead.
 Kenney, who retired form Bath Fire Department as chief, joked about the role reversal, he said. "I told the boys, 'I've ridden in the back of ambulances before, but this was the first time as a patient.' "
 Kenney received treatment and antibiotics for potential exposure to rabies, he said. His most serious injury was to a thumb, Kenney said, with the fox's tooth ripping at his left eye lid, barely missing his eyeball. That one has cataracts anyway, he said.
 Bath Deputy Police Chief Andrew Booth said Tuesday the animal tested positive for the rabies virus. He also presumed rabies in the September attack on Kenney, though that animal wasn't tested, Booth said.
 Rabies, a virus transmitted from rabid animals such as bats, raccoons and foxes, can be deadly if left untreated, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warns. Symptoms - like delirium and the fear of water - may take weeks or months to appear.
 Human rabies cases are rare, with 1 to 3 confirmed annually, the CDC said.
 Sagadahoc County saw an uptick in confirmed rabies last year, with 21 confirmed animal exposures - more than a fifth of all cases statewide, according to Maine public health data.
 Gray and red foxes accounted for eight cases alone in Bath, which has more than 8,000 residents.
 That has led to a rash of attacks and worries about rabies exposure, which prompted a city information session last month, said Lindsey Goudreau, a spokeswoman for Bath. State health officials advised residents about best practices and what to do in case of exposure.
 "This problem is out of our league as a city," she said, though she said police officers have responsive in responding to attacks and animals suspected to carry rabies.
 In West Bath, a fox attacked two men and ran off with a shoe, the Portland Press Herald reported.
 Officials acknowledged it was strange for a resident to be attacked by foxes in separate incidents.
 Kenney believes there is a fox den near his home, which is surrounded by gardens and sheds were foxes hide and search for squirrels, trash and compost heaps.
 The fox that attacked him in September, yipping at his pant legs, may have been a pup. "I said, 'I'm sorry Mr. Fox, it's either you or me,' " he recalled.
 Kenney has a new wooden cane fashioned from a tree, he said, that was favored by his father many years ago. It'll bring more "firepower" to any future fox fight, he said.
 He will get a follow-up rabies shot on Friday and another next week, Kenney said, but he does not know if anything more can be done about potential exposure.
 The concerns linger only for a moment. He had errands to run Tuesday morning.
 "I got my big cane with me," he said.

If you’re looking for avenues for success for LSU, take a look back at Clemson’s game against Ohio State in the semifinals.
 Ohio State punched Clemson in the mouth early, and Clemson didn’t know how to respond for the majority of two quarters. It had been months since a team actually took it to Clemson. Ohio State used tempo and some phenomenal catches on the outside to build a 16-0 lead. It could have been worse, though. Ohio State had to settle for two field goals. After key drops in the red zone, a targeting call, a roughing the punter and a controversial “incomplete” pass that all went against Ohio State, Clemson escaped with a 29-23 semifinal win.
 In many ways Ohio State looked like the better team that made more mistakes. Don’t expect Burrow and this offense to offer any handouts this weekend. If Clemson takes one on the chin early and waits until late into the second quarter to respond, LSU will have built an insurmountable lead.
 Can Clemson’s defense do what no other team has this season? Can Venables dial up the game plan of his life to stop one of the greatest offenses we’ve ever seen in college football?
 The finish line is near, and so is perfection for LSU.

 It’s hard to ignore his contribution to Algeria’s Africa Cup of Nations success, at the detriment of Mane’s Senegal, and the silverware he picked up with Manchester City last season.
 Nonetheless, it’s fantastic that Mane is now the face of African football!
