This is not a classic whistleblowing situation, wherein the confidentiality of the leaker should ideally remain sacrosanct in light of an important, socially-beneficial disclosure. This is the opposite: a leak seemingly manufactured with the intent of creating a media firestorm around a figure the FBI had already investigated, to no effect. The FBI's key "confidential" source was already naming himself in a major global newspaper as he openly pushed Russia conspiracy theories.

All of this — White House discussions, the taping of Flynn, Flynn-Russia conversations — were highly classified. They were never supposed to go public. If no one commits a felony by leaking them, this whole situation likely disappears. It is hard to believe anyone in Trump's White House, or even in the last days of Obama's presidency, would try to prosecute Flynn for a "Logan Act" violation of a possibly unconstitutional law he probably didn't even violate, and that hasn't been successfully prosecuted in its over two centuries of existence.

Whether and to what degree the Cambridge Four's individual acts were formally coordinated can likely only be proven by testimony under oath and reviewing phone records, emails, and documents — things government officials seem to have blocked the Cambridge Four and Halper's FBI handler, Steve Somma, from for four years. Yet it would seem odd if four interconnected individuals linked to a town thousands of miles from Moscow or DC, randomly took acts that fit together so perfectly to take down Flynn.

She had been asked if Vice President Biden raised the Logan Act in their Oval Office discussion of Flynn on January 5, 2017, seven days before the felony leak on Flynn's alleged "Logan Act" violation was published. Flynn's appeals hearing is on Tuesday, and Vice President Biden and President Trump are on the ballot in less than 90 days. These issues should be beyond politics.

This week's artifact brings to mind the halcyon days from the summers of our youth. To a child -- and let's face it, many adults as well -- a dish or cone of cold, creamy, delicious ice cream can seem like a special treat on a broiling hot day, and unless you are going to the nearest chain ice cream shop, you are going to need something similar to our artifact to get it out of the carton.
   
 Our records don't record the age of our artifact, but this style was patented in 1876 and was manufactured until the 1940s. Unfortunately, we also don't know who donated it, but the general consensus is it was associated with one of the local ice cream parlors.
   
 It seems like almost every village, town and city has someplace that sold ice cream, and failing that, there was always the homemade version. Believe it or not, an ice cream-like food was invented in China some 2,200 years ago. A mixture of milk and rice was packed with snow and mixed well, although it is unclear how it tasted. At first, sticks or paddles were used to serve ice cream, but they were messy at best. It wasn't until 1897, when a gentleman by the name of Alfred L. Cralle invented the lever-action dipper. The idea was the person dispensing the ice cream would get a scoop full, then press the lever on the scoop. A little arm then would sweep around the inside of the bell, freeing the product from the scoop.
   
 From there, a plethora of designs, some practical and some not, hit the market. There were specialized shapes (think squares, hearts, etc), spring- loaded half-moons, paddles, and even a short-lived electric dipper from the 1920s that was intended to heat up, allowing the product to melt just enough to get it out of the dipper. Unfortunately, it tended to shock the operator while shorting out or simply overheat and then short itself out, thus rendering it useless. Many of these designs are still with us today, and can be found in just about every kitchen.
   
 Our artifact is known as a "key dipper," with the key on the back being used to turn the arms inside the bell, which would release the ice cream inside.
   
 In the late 1800s, ice-cream became popular with the masses, and ice cream parlors began to appear. Des Moines County certainly had its share of places to choose from over the years.
   
 Our artifact is not on display at this time. However, you never know. It may make an appearance at some point in the future.

Superintendent Misty Wharton wrote in a letter that the school district will offer professional development to their staff and schedule one-on-one virtual training sessions for parents and students, will have a rigorous curriculum for Pre-K-12 students, check in daily with students, and reinstate the standard grading system.
 “This summer, I have been working with the county commissioners to increase access and funding for all of our students to access reliable internet,” Wharton wrote. “We have developed a plan to provide internet up Blaine, out Hwy 22 and Little Nestucca River Road.”
 The school district is also working on a scholarship program to bring internet to students’ homes. They will also be providing a laptop, Chromebook or tablet to every student who needs one.
 Tillamook School District made the announcement Thursday, Aug. 6, to start the school year by utilizing the comprehensive distance learning model for trimester one. In a letter to families, Superintendent Curt Shelley said the comprehensive distance learning would be very different from the virtual program the district implemented in the spring.
 Students will receive grades at the conclusion of each trimester, they will be required to check in with teachers on a daily basis for social-emotional check ins and academic support, CANVAS will be used, and Acellus will be utilized as the online curriculum for students grades K-12. Training will be offered for families for the use of both CANVAS and Acellus. Staff will be reporting to buildings daily. Devices can be checked out for all students in need in grades PreK-12.
 “We know that, even with these adjustments, it will not be in same as having students in our seats in our schools,” Shelley wrote in the letter. “For now, we must err on the side of caution to protect our kids and our staff.”
 Shelley said the school district hopes to re-evaluate the situation in late November and plan for in-person education. Decisions will be made based on Oregon Department of Education and other state level guidance, as well as the most current COVID-19 data for Tillamook County.

The supposedly "confidential" source Halper seemingly made a public, last- ditch attempt to try and legitimize allegations of a Russian conspiracy at Cambridge through a December 16 _Financial Times_ newspaper article. Halper claimed he and Dearlove quit the seminar that hosted Flynn due to "unacceptable Russian influence." Halper's partner Andrew initially called Halper's assertions "absurd." Another professor added that "Cambridge is a wonderful place for conspiracy theories, but the idea there is a Machiavellian plot here is ridiculous...it's real Reds under the Bed stuff — the whole thing is ludicrous."

"The pressure is really what makes you work. The fear and the embarrassment," said Povitsky. "By the time you're taping it, it is what it is. In terms of going out there and having certain material not land, that doesn't really scare me. I think what scares me is feeling unprepared. Jokes don't work, that's par for the course. You have to be prepared that not everything you say will be funny or you'll get your heart broken too many times. When jokes bomb, that separates someone who is new from someone who is a pro. A pro can handle things not going well and keep going. That was definitely a skill that I learned early on."
