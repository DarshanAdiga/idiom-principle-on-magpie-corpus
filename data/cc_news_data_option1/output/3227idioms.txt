BEDMINSTER, N.J. (AP) — Seeking to amplify his law-and-order message, President Donald Trump on Friday told hundreds of New York Police Department officers that “no one will be safe in Biden’s America” if the former Democratic vice president defeats him in November .“This guy has been taking your dignity away and your respect,”” Trump said of former Vice President Joe Biden. “And I’m telling you on Nov. 3 you’re going to be getting it back.”Trump spoke to members of the City of New York Police Benevolent Association, the union representing some 24,000 rank-and-file officers as he steps up his attacks on Biden and his running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris. The president’s campaign is looking to raise doubts about the Biden-Harris ticket’s ability to keep the peace in the nation’s biggest metropolises. Trump was formally endorsed by the union during the event at his New Jersey golf course.Trump is ripping a page out of Richard Nixon’s law-and-order campaign playbook from 1968 — when American streets were rife with racial protests and Nixon campaigned vowing to crack down and restore order in an appeal tailored to white voters.At a moment when the nation has been jarred by sometimes violent protests over police brutality, Trump has repeatedly blamed big city mayors in Democratic-strongholds - including New York, Portland, Seattle, Chicago - for undermining police officers.“In New York, you have New York’s finest, but they’ve totally taken away their incentive,” Trump said earlier this week. “They’ve taken away their lives, in a sense, because they don’t allow them to do their job.””In recent weeks, Trump has repeatedly and falsely asserted that Biden supports defunding the police. His campaign has aired advertising in battleground states showing a woman calling police for help as an intruder breaks into her home and getting a voice recording informing her that, because the police have been defunded, no one is available to take her call.Trump has also tweeted warnings to “Suburban Housewives” that Biden will shatter their communities by requiring communities to build lower income housing as part of new development. Trump recently revoked an Obama-era housing regulation designed to eliminate racial disparities in the suburbs.The president, in his speech, also took sharp aim at Harris, a former California attorney general, as being hostile to police, and suggested that she and Biden were at the center of “a left wing war on cops”“Probably she’s a step worse, Kamala,” Trump said.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.

He was excited to record the bird, the 393rd species he has spotted in Maine, edging closer to a life goal of spotting at least 400 species of birds in Maine. He said there are no signs the bird is poised to leave anytime soon. He said sometimes rare bird sightings are "one-day wonders" and a lot tend to stick around for two or three days, taking a break to rest and eat then continuing their journey. He said the grebe may stick around all summer, but hopefully will depart before snow and ice come.

MANSFIELD - Last September an explosion and fire at Canaan Fuels, a gas station and auto repair shop, claimed the life of long-time mechanic Ron Stanovitch of Mansfield. This month, Canaan Fuels reopened an all-new station as well as shop named for Stanovitch.
 The fire at Canaan Fuels at Route 106 and Pratt Street started with an explosion at 12:34 on Sept. 25, 2019, that sent a huge plume of smoke and flame into the sky and triggered evacuation of the Mansfield Public Library near by.
 Station employees shut down the pumps and left the building, but then went back inside when they realized Stanovitch was still inside and in trouble. The men got the Stanovitch out of the building. A fire extinguisher was used on him to douse the flames.
 "They all rushed to him to save his life," said Sammy Kanan, who co-owns Canaan Fuels with his brother Mike.
 Stanovitch was taken by Medflight to Massachusetts General Hospital with life- threatening burns. He died of his injuries on Nov. 5 at the age of 64.
 "He was a great great guy," Sammy Kanan said at a reopening event for the new station on Aug. 13. "He worked for us for many many years and he's the reason we are here today."
 He thanked the Mansfield Fire Department and other departments who responded the day of the fire and the Mansfield community for its support.
 "I want to thank the first responders who came on the that horrible day in September.. .it could have been much worse," state Rep. Jay Barrows, R-Mansfield, said.
 "I could never have asked for better community that the Mansfield community," Sammy Kanan said.
 He said the company received numerous calls, texts, and emails with people offering help. Within six days of the fire, $40,000 had been raised for Stanovitch and his family.
 Sammy Kanan said the company decided it would definitely rebuild just a few days after the fire.
 "You can rebuild a building but you can never bring back a life," he said.
 The new repair shop will be named Ronald's Service Center, Sammy Kanan said.
 "It's the least we can do for him," he said.
 Stanovitch's wife Deborah, son Ron Jr. and family and friends were on hand for the announcement.
 "What a wonderful tribute this is to him," state Rep. Elizabeth Poirier, R-N Attleboro said.
 "We're very happy to be back in business," Sammy Kanan said. "This has been a tough road. We're fighters and we're not going to give up easy."
 "When you feel that you are at your lowest, and Mike and Sam I know you have been there, you have felt that, but you look to people around you," said state Sen. Paul Feeney, D-Foxborough. "You look to your community and there is no better example than this community of Mansfield. Every single time a tragedy has stricken this community… folks come together.
 "We want to say thank you for continuing to invest in our community of Mansfield, for continuing to believe in the spirit of this town, for continuing to serve this community."
 "I want to thank you guys for not packing in up and going home," Barrows said.
 The new Canaan Fuels is 700 square feet larger than the previous station, Sammy Kanan said. It also has added a snack shop and has one more gas pump for a total of three.
 "The new place is beautiful," Select Board member Neil Rhein said.
 Canaan Fuels has six locations. Mike Kanan manages the Mansfield station, which the company purchased in 2009. The station dates back many years in town and was previously called Hugo's in the 1950s and 1960s, Barrow said.

Ecuador amplía estado de excepción por pandemia, que deja cerca de 100.000 casosQuito, 15 Ago 2020 (AFP) - Ecuador, que bordea los 100.000 casos de coronavirus, extendió hasta el próximo 13 de septiembre el estado de excepción que rige desde marzo, anunció este viernes el presidente Lenín Moreno."He dispuesto a través de Decreto Ejecutivo, la renovación por 30 días más del Estado de Excepción en todo el territorio nacional para evitar la propagación del COVID-19", escribió Moreno en su cuenta de Twitter.Ecuador, con unos 17,5 millones de habitantes, reporta 99.409 casos de coronavirus, incluidos 6.030 muertos. Las autoridades estiman que hay otros 3.550 fallecidos probables por la covid-19.Quito, donde habitan unos 2,8 millones de personas, es la ciudad más afectada con 17.992 infectados. Le sigue Guayaquil, que entre marzo y abril vivió lo peor de la pandemia al ser uno de los primeros focos de la enfermedad en Latinoamérica con muertos en casas y calles.El puerto de Guayaquil, donde viven unos 2,7 millones de habitantes, registra 12.393 infectados.El nuevo coronavirus se ha cobrado la vida de más de 755.000 personas en todo el planeta y más de 21 millones se han contagiado, según el último balance de la AFP basado en fuentes oficiales.Tras detectarse el primer caso de la covid-19 en Ecuador, el 29 de febrero, el mandatario ordenó el estado de excepción por 60 días el 16 de marzo y luego lo renovó por otros 30, como le permite la Constitución.El estado de excepción permite al Ejecutivo mantener medidas de restricción, incluidos el toque de queda, la movilización de las Fuerzas Armadas y la suspensión de derechos como la libertad de reunión ante la pandemia.El gobierno ha flexibilizado desde mayo las medidas de confinamiento, reabriendo sus fronteras aéreas y permitiendo que se reanuden actividades recreativas como la visita a playas y reservas naturales, así como el aumento del trabajo presencial.También impuso un sistema de semáforo, con tres niveles, para medir el grado de riesgo por la pandemia. Al menos una decena de los 221 cantones del país tienen activada la alerta roja, de máximo riesgo, lo que implica un toque de queda de ocho horas diarias y mayores restricciones de movilidad.El Comité de Operaciones de Emergencia (COE) nacional impuso restricciones adicionales para 18 de las 24 provincias, entre ellas la prohibición de reuniones sociales y de la venta de licor entre viernes y domingo.El organismo también recomendó al presidente extender el estado de excepción por considerar que "la suspensión y limitación de los derechos a la libertad de tránsito, así como a la libertad de reunión y asociación, por medio del aislamiento y distanciamiento social, aún son medidas necesarias para mitigar la propagación del COVID-19", según consta en su informe del martes.pld/gfe
