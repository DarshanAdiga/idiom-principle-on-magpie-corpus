Orson Welles was a hotshot widely known for his work in radio, which ultimately led to a film deal despite his lack of experience. Welles was given a job as director, despite the fact that he had no idea what directors actually do behind the scenes. Welles stated that his first couple of weeks on set he frequently re-adjusted and moved lighting thinking that was his part to play in the process. The crew let him go on doing that for a while, but eventually, someone told him and Welles sheepishly apologized to everyone involved.

Orson Welles was well-aware of William Randolph Hearst's efforts behind the scenes to stop _Citizen Kane_ , but that didn't prevent him from a gesture of goodwill when the two men happened to be in the same elevator. Welles, knowing that Hearst was a friend of his father, decided to extend an invitation for him to see _Citizen Kane_ on opening night. Welles later said that Hearst remained silent the rest of the ride, choosing not to respond to the invitation. Welles, taking the hint, decided to take a jab at Hearst before departing and said Charles Foster Kane (the character alleged to be based on Hearst) would've accepted the invitation.

“Once you taste success, you want more of it,” Hare said. “The guys last year did a good job showing what success feels like and this group has done a good job to be in position to have more of it.
 “Getting rings is fun. That’s probably one of the most fun you can have.”
 Mesquite’s trip to the finals was one met with little adversity. The Wildcats only loss this season came in a high-scoring affair to current 5A top seed Sunrise Mountain in Week 2. Mesquite entered the playoffs as the third-ranked team after Washington was forced to cancel its play-in game against the Wildcats, dropping them down from their previous ranking as No. 1.
 The drop in ranking resulted in Mesquite having arguably the toughest draw in the quarterfinals, as it matched up with perennial 3A power Northwest Christian, who was moved up to 4A this season. Mesquite prevailed in a game that was closer than the scoreboard showed and moved on to face American Leadership Academy — Queen Creek — last year’s 3A champion — in the semifinals.
 The Wildcats’ matchup with the Patriots came down to a potential game-tying field goal that ended up missing the uprights, securing Mesquite’s spot in the finals.
 “I don’t think I was ever nervous,” Hare said of the field goal attempt by ALA. “I was more focused on getting my plays set for overtime. I just wanted to make sure we were ready for anything.”
 Anywhere, any place at any time is a motto Hare lives by when it comes to coaching. He and his team refused to harp on the fact they dropped two spots in the rankings after not playing a game. At the end of the day, it made no difference.
 Hare is confident in his players, and for good reason. Along with Thompson, junior athlete Andrew Morris is one of the top playmakers in the state on both sides of the ball. Lavontae Trotter and Riales Hopper provide speed at wideout along with senior Eric Lira, who transferred from Central High School before the season after the Phoenix Union High School District initially shut down fall sports.

Disney Investor Day is off and running, but some fans are confused about the newly-announced Star service. The new initiative will introduce a lot more of the company's library for International markets. Things like the larger FOX catalog, ESPN content, and more mature movies will be included in the service. However, a lot of fans missed that memo and are thinking these changes are coming to the United States version of Disney+. It is not, so you don't have to worry about underaged audiences stumbling into _Alien_ or something like that. Still, it could pose a bit of confusion before the company puts out a statement clarifying how this whole rollout works. The conversations about "mature" content have raged since the launch of Disney+ and don't seem to be subsiding any time soon.

While William Randolph Hearst or any cronies associated with him weren't successful in keeping _Citizen Kane_ from the public, he was able to effectively squash how many saw it initially. Smithsonian notes that Hearst's continuous attempts in the press to label Orson Welles as a communist prevented many major theater chains from showing the movie, which in turn led to it losing money at the box office. Welles' career afterward was believed to suffer as a result, even if the legacy of the movie ended up legendary in the long run.

So this is going to take some of the load off from that substation and that substation pretty much serves the city of Arab. This will give us an opportunity to open the door for bigger businesses and bigger industries,” said White.The new substation is expected to be online November 2021.Copyright 2020 WAFF.

With every game, nothing is perfect. So let's nitpick. Free throws were a problem for the Black Bears, who made just 6 of 12 from the line. Maine's free throw percentage has steadily improved over the last four seasons, from 66 percent in 2016-17 to 76 percent last season, so let's call Thursday's struggles just one of those things. In a closer game, and there will be plenty of those, 50 percent at the line could be the difference between a win and a loss. There's no doubt Vachon stressed that to her team after the game.

The feud of Orson Welles and Herman Mankiewicz is one of the major stories behind the scenes of _Citizen Kane._ While the truth of who deserved credit isn't quite as cut and dry as _Mank_ characterized it, the feud is though, and Welles did try to remove Mankiewicz's credit from the film. Fortunately for Mankiewicz, RKO pictures required that his name is in the credits (via ScreenRant). Apparently, this was in the deal before the two ever had a falling out, so Welles might've known this prior to his attempt.

On February 26, 2012, Trayvon Martin was assassinated. I use the word _assassinated_ because his murder was absolutely political--especially for Black America. Like Trayvon, I was 17 years old at the time. Up until that point, I believed in a post-racial America. I had come of age without the influence of social media and lived in a predominantly Black and Brown community where everyone was on similar socioeconomic footing, which insulated me from structural injustices. I was so insulated that even after Trayvon's death, I believed vehemently that _justice_ would be served. Summer 2013 would be the moment I knew this country wasn't capable of justice--and that a radical shift was needed.
 That summer, after more than a year of advocacy, the non-acquittal came in. I felt so debilitated by the crushing weight of disappointment and betrayal (something I would unfortunately become familiar with). I was a first-year student in college being told that the world was my oyster, but that didn't ring true for my community. It was bigger than Trayvon at that point. His death had pulled back my blinders and allowed me to see the widespread racial _and_ economic inequities of this country. Suddenly, I was seeing the community I grew up in differently from the multiracial utopia I remembered from childhood. Suddenly, I was realizing that the diversity I loved was a product of segregation and that my college peers had far different experiences than I did. I had to come to terms with the fact that although Trayvon's death was a "wake-up call" for me, there were so many other victims of vigilante, police, and/or white supremacist violence. It left me feeling extremely helpless--and played.

Further detractions from cultural reality can be seen in Selena's on-screen musical performances. Selena's most iconic performance was in 1995 when she performed a disco medley at the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo in the Astrodome, filmed just one month before her death. Her flawless vocals, purple bell-bottom jumpsuit, and command of the stage were all there. But it was also a performance layered with her earliest references--Donna Summer, Gloria Gaynor, and Black disco groups--who would go on to shape her unique vocal style.
 Citing Michael and Janet Jackson, Mariah Carey, Jody Watley, and Whitney Houston as her primary influences, Selena found Black music aspirational, a standard to live up to and an origin to credit. Selena's life cannot be portrayed without Blackness--it is embodied within the contexts of her margins. In the 1997 film, Jennifer Lopez, who plays Selena, wears a bustier for the first time while singing "Carcacha," one of Selena's first cumbia hits, at a carnival somewhere in Texas. In reality, Selena's bustier debut happened during an outdoor concert in Houston while covering Janet Jackson's "When I Think of You," one of her favorite songs. She would go on to borrow heavily (and consistently cite) Janet Jackson's _Rhythm Nation_ looks for her black belts, hats, tights, and boots costumes on and off the stage. Even though early performances of Michael Jackson's "Billie Jean" and Jody Watley's "I'm Looking for a New Love" got chilly receptions from crowds, Selena insisted on connecting the cultures, and eventually pulled off performing "What Have You Done for Me Lately," Ralph Tresvant's "Sensitivity," and even Black Box's house classic "Everybody Everybody" to receptive crowds.

JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (WJXT) - Authorities are investigating after a Florida mother says she was brutally attacked in her own home while her 6-year-old son slept in another room.Lashelle Jacobs says she was left with bruises on her face and chopped off hair after an attack last Thursday in her Jacksonville, Florida, home.“I have a concussion, and one of my eardrums is ruptured. Then, as you can see, there’s just bruises all over my face. The inside of my mouth is bruised, and the back of my head, it’s so damaged right now that it’s squishy to feel,” she said.Jacobs says she was asleep in bed with her 6-year-old son when she heard someone banging on her door around 11 p.m.“As soon as I opened my door, I guess she grabbed it and stood in front of my door. She’s like, ‘They’re following me. They’re following me.’ And I was like, ‘Who’s following you?’ Then, when I went to go look… that’s when she attacked me, and I fell to the ground,” she said.Jacobs says she blacked out as a woman and man she’d never seen before continuously beat her.“Then, when I woke back up, I remember them holding my hair, saying if I moved or screamed, they were going to stab me and continue to cut my hair,” she said.Finally, Jacobs managed to crawl up the stairs, get her phone and call 911. Despite the incident scarring her for life, she’s just glad her son never woke up during the attack.“He doesn’t know. My mom told him that I’m in quarantine right now, so that’s why I can’t see him. I don’t want him to see me like this at all,” she said.The Jacksonville Sheriff’s Office is investigating the attack. Jacobs’ family is offering a $5,000 reward for information that can lead to arrest of the suspects.Copyright 2020 WJXT via CNN Newsource. All rights reserved.

In the '90s, Houston, a frequent tour stop for Selena, was a thriving transnational epicenter of Black and Latinx music, home to the "chopped and screwed" DJ technique; Sugar Hill Recording Studios; the cumbia, conjunto, Tejano, and bandas musical genres of La Onda Grupera; and the R&B group who would soon give us Destiny's Child and later, Beyonce. In the moss-bricked apartment complexes, trailer parks, and young pine starter homes all along Texas's east coast, Black and Latinx cultures are next-door neighbors with porous borders, inextricable in their relation. It's the Texas I know, Selena's Texas, and one that continues to go unseen.
 Blackness and cultural specificity is often erased under the guise of Latinx representation, a demand for inclusivity that, in an effort to appeal to the mainstream, flattens potentially complex characters and their contexts into mere identities, surfaces to project empathy onto. Selena's love of Black disco, pop, and R&B was formative, but in the television version of her life, it is only ever depicted as a fixation on "English music" and a desire to "cross over," a metaphor for the striving immigrant ready to assimilate--the American Dream. Selena's Black influences are never used as opportunities to engage the deeper, more complex topic of why Mexican-American children of immigrants might more readily identify with Black culture than Mexican culture, and how it might speak to their social, political, and geographic displacement and alienation. The topic is only half-explored in the film when Selena's father Abraham lectures her about how, "We gotta be more Mexican than the Mexicans and more American than the Americans, both at the same time," and in the series, when Selena is categorized as "world music" and styled in an ethnic collage for her first major-label album cover. But she never gets to ask any real questions; Selena is only ever depicted as a bicultural wunderkind who laughs off not knowing Spanish in public, rather than a child navigating a complicated identity while having to feign a Mexican one.

After seven long years of anticipation, Cyberpunk 2077 is finally out, and so far we’ve had the opportunity to benchmark it on PC and play it on Stadia . Our impressions of the game’s performance have been generally positive so far, but these aren’t the only platforms the game is on. The game’s PS4 and Xbox One versions are also out today, but aside from two short gameplay videos , developer CD Projekt Red hadn’t given press any access to the game on console. Now that the game’s…

Un importante número de trabajadores del régimen laboral privado a nivel nacional recibirá - o ya recibió en las últimas horas - la gratificación de Navidad, que es equivalente a una remuneración completa (sin descuentos) y cuyo plazo máximo de pago es el martes 15 de diciembre. De acuerdo con la Ley N° 27735, este beneficio se entrega dos veces al año, en los meses de julio (Fiestas Patrias) y diciembre (Navidad), y los empleadores están obligados a realizar dicho abono porque así lo establece el marco legal vigente. Tienen derecho a recibir la gratificación los trabajadores de la actividad privada que tengan un contrato a tiempo indefinido, a plazo fijo o a tiempo parcial. Es requisito que el trabajador haya laborado durante un semestre completo - es decir, de julio a diciembre - para que se haga acreedor a una gratificación equivalente a un sueldo extra. En caso no sea así, recibirá un monto proporcional a la cantidad de meses trabajados. Cabe indicar que, junto con la gratificación, los trabajadores del sector privado también recibirán este mes una bonificación extraordinaria del 9% por los aportes a EsSalud (Seguro Social) que las empresas realizan de forma mensual (los trabajadores afiliados a una EPS recibirán el 6,75% del monto de la gratificación). No, a los practicantes no se les paga gratificación; no obstante, quienes se encuentren trabajando en esa condición tienen derecho a recibir una subvención adicional por cada seis meses de labores en la empresa. En este caso, se tomará en cuenta los meses y días trabajados, sin considerar el período de la suspensión perfecta de labores, que no se computa para realizar el cálculo de la gratificación. Esto quiere decir que el trabajador que fue cesado temporalmente de sus labores puede recibir el beneficio de forma proporcional al tiempo que laboró en el último semestre. Hasta el martes 15 de diciembre de 2020, aunque algunas empresas suelen pagar este beneficio en los días previos a la fecha límite.

Not everyone has greeted the thesis with open arms. The effect of introduced plants on native biodiversity has been one of the most contentious issues in ecology, compared to gun control, abortion, and other “hot-button issues in contemporary American culture” by Peter Del Tredici, senior research scientist at Harvard’s Arnold Arboretum. “Over the past few decades,” 19 leading ecologists, including Del Tredici, wrote in a 2011 commentary in the journal _Nature_ , “‘non-native’ species have been vilified for driving beloved ‘native’ species to extinction and generally polluting ‘natural’ environments… ‘Nativeness’ is not a sign of evolutionary fitness or of a species having positive effects.”

"I didn't wake up this morning and [decide]," Luck said during his retirement press conference last year. "A week and a half to two weeks. It's been a little bit fast and furious and the lack of progress on my ankle. I'm in pain. I'm still in pain. I've been in this cycle. It's been four years of this injury-pain cycle. For me to move forward in my life the way I want to, it didn't involve football." Luck went on to say a series of injuries over the last few years played a role in his decision.
 "This has been my personal journey in football," he added. "Everybody's journey is different. Over the past week, I was thinking, 'Am I going to have a bunch of resentment toward the game or spite coming into this building?' And I don't. All I feel is love for this game and love for my teammates. I know my journey has had some ups and downs and it has taken a toll over the last four years and the mental and emotional toll that that takes as well. I didn't imagine retiring until two weeks ago." Luck was drafted by the Colts No. 1 overall in 2012. He was named to the Pro Bowl four times, was named Comeback Player of the Year in 2018 and led the NFL in passing touchdowns in 2014, the same year led the Colts to the AFC Championship game.

Everyone else lines up behind them.

Nonetheless, Trump has labeled this case “the big one” and filed a motion yesterday to intervene. In plain English, that means he wants to join Texas as a party in the case because he has a stake in its outcome. Other politicians are clamoring to get on board. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, eager to show his boundless loyalty to the man he has called “utterly amoral,” a “serial philanderer,” a “narcissist at a level I don’t think this country’s ever seen,” and a “pathological liar,” has offered to argue the case in the Supreme Court.

Austin would make history as the first Black person to lead the Pentagon if confirmed by the Senate. Austin is a retired Army general and is the former commander of the US Central Command. He has worked closely with Biden in the past. While Biden was vice president, Austin served as the vice chief of staff of the Army and commanding general of US forces in Iraq, and later the commander of CENTCOM. Biden and Austin had discussions on a range of issues, including those in the Middle East and Central and South Asia. Austin would need a congressional waiver to be confirmed for the civilian post because federal law requires seven years of retirement from active duty before taking on the role. Austin retired from active-duty service only four years ago.

Marsh played his last Test in January 2019 against India but Langer said you “never discriminate against age” and the left-hander could be in the mix with David Warner ruled out and Will Pucovski under a concussion cloud. Langer’s comments throw a whole new dimension on the selection conundrum facing the Aussies with Victorian opener Marcus Harris considered the next in line. Harris, who made 239 for the Vics in a record-breaking 286 run stand with Pucovski against South Australia in October, played the last of his nine Tests in the Ashes last year. Marsh, who is with the Melbourne Renegades preapring for their first BBL game on Saturday, also made 485 runs in six Shield innings as captain of WA.That included three hundreds and Langer’s support could put him in line to add to his 38 Tests when Australia take on India in Adelaide next week.“You never discriminate against age. He’s doing everything possible,” Langer told 7NEWS on Friday.“His numbers in Sheffield Shield cricket - not only this year but the back end of last year - were absolutely elite.“There’s no more popular player in the Australian cricket team than Shaun, maybe his brother (Mitch) actually.“It’s an incredible family, the Marsh family, they’re much loved within the team.” Usman Khawaja is another name in the mix but on Thursday he said he was only focused on preparing for the Stars of the Big Bash season with the Sydney Thunder. “I’m just here focusing on Thunder stuff, that’s the honest truth. I’m practising with the guys every day, getting ready for that first T20 game. That’s really how far I look. I don’t look beyond that,” he said on Thursday.“Ben Cutting is a new recruit and he asked me the schedule for the next two weeks and I can’t even tell him. I like to keep my feet on the ground, not look too far head and focus on what’s in front of me right now.“I can’t focus on what I don’t have. With all my experience in cricket and life, you control what you can control.”Neither Marsh or Khawaja, who, like Harris, played his last Test during the Ashes last year, haven’t been picked for Friday’s Pink-ball tour game against the Indians. But Langer, who puts a premium on early runs, said Marsh was “doing everything right”.“You can imagine I’m very passionate about getting the opening partnership right,” the coach said.“I know how important it is to a successful team.“We’ll be working through that and hopefully get the pieces of the jigsaw puzzle right for the first Test match and beyond next week.”

The debut season of TNT's _Snowpiercer_ concluded with a number of compelling cliffhangers, leaving audiences to wonder what we could expect from the upcoming Season Two, with showrunner Graeme Manson recently hinting that we could expect to see an exciting family reunion. Potentially complicating matters is the fact that the second season saw the arrival of Sean Bean's villainous character, which hinted at the entire dystopic world being upended in the new season. The new season of _Snowpiercer_ is set to debut on TNT on Monday, January 25, 2021, bringing with it a number of exciting reveals.
 "It doesn't seem like it's going to be an easy ride for Melanie (Jennifer Connelly) with her daughter (Rowan Blanchard) where she 'steps into a hug,'" Manson confirmed with _TVLine_. "For one, we're still unclear as to the charisma and the capacity of Wilford (Bean). We have our ideas about him through Melanie and through his myth, but what kind of life has Alexandra been living over there [on Big Alice]? What she believes about her mother, I think, is one of the biggest questions to kick off the top of the season."
 This is only the latest tease Manson offered about Bean's character, having previously used choice words to set the stage for the nefarious figure.
 "I can just say that Sean Bean's Wilford is dastardly and fun and very well- dressed," Manson shared with _Entertainment Weekly_. "The thing that we don't know at the beginning of the season is what Wilford has done to [Alexandra's] mind."
 He added, "How has Wilford turned her against Melanie?"
 One of the series' stars, Sheila Vand, confirmed that Season Two will surely be a wild ride.
 "What I can say is that there's another society of people operating a lot differently than the train from Season One," Vand shared with ComicBook.com. "And what I think I can say is that it gets a lot weirder, that the people on the other train have not necessarily had the resources that we've had to survive, and so what they've gone through is a lot bleaker and it's led to some creepier and stranger things. And I'm into that because I like when the show leans more into the genre side of things. I think people can expect to see a bit more of that, a bit more of the sci-fi element of things, in Season Two."
