Owning a home is a huge undertaking, but a potentially rewarding one. When you buy a place of your own, you get to build equity in an asset that can increase in value over time. You also gain the stability of not having a landlord who can opt to not renew your lease. And, you can call the shots. Want to adopt a dog? That's your choice. Want to knock down a wall? Go for it (with caution, of course).

THE conversations on board of a courtesy bus after a night at the pub are normally private. Until now.
 A new series called _Courtesy Bus_ had its pilot episode filmed on the Northern Rivers.
 Director Brett Stephens, from Six Sixty Productions ( _Deadlock_ , _Get Grubby TV_ ), said the project is a comedy written as a 30-minute, six-part series.
 “Where possible, we’ve used mostly local cast and crew, trying to build a great show,” he said.
 “It’s a comedy with heart.
 “My wife and I had the idea about seven years ago, sitting at a leagues club and the courtesy bus announcement came on.
 “I approached Many Nolan and wanted her to play the lead, she was very interested and we ended up co-writing the pilot.”
 Mr Stephens also enlisted the help of local actors such as Nell Schofield ( _Puberty Blues_ ) and Tony Barry ( _Australia_ , _Good Bye Pork Pie_ ).
 “We invited an indigenous comedian Andy Saunders who just won _The Block_ with his wife, Mandy invited him to get on board and he was great,” he said.
 “One of the best moves we made was to use Chris Watson, the actual manager at the Bangalow Bowlo, to play the manager of the bowlo, so everyone at the bowlo have been absolutely wonderful.”
 The pilot will be done in about a month, the director said.
 “Half the cast will be regular characters, and the other half will be different people paying themselves and telling their stories,” he explained.
 “We are seeking people to be on it.
 “We just had Benny (Ben Reed, lead guitar) from Byron Bay band Skeggs, and he was a natural, he was great,” he said.
 “We also had a local couple from Byron, they have a great story and I knew them personally, Sarah and Jason, she is a performer and he is a builder, and they did a great job.
 “Greg “Nashy’ Nash, a well-known Bangalow character, came down and told a great story too.”
 Mr Stephens hoped once the pilot is complete, a media company will be interested in supporting it.
 “We hope broadcasters and streamers get interested once they see the pilot, and I'm sure they’ll come on board once they see the story, the cast, they will get on board the _Courtesy Bus_.’

 —
 Manitoba
 Government officials say they've been assembling the necessary people and equipment to set up a large-scale "super site" to deliver the vaccine as soon as it is available.
 Premier Brian Pallister says the province has also purchased the necessary supplies to administer two doses of the vaccine to every person in the province.
 The first freezer able to store the Pfizer vaccine at low temperatures has been delivered and installed, with another four on the way.
 As the vaccine supply from the federal government expands over the coming months, the province says it will become more widely available in a larger number of sites, similar to a conventional vaccination campaign, such as the annual flu shot.
 \--
 Saskatchewan
 Premier Scott Moe says Saskatchewan is ready to receive doses of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine, with the province set to reveal its distribution plan later today.
 Moe says the province has an ultra-low-temperature freezer required to store the product.
 Moe originally intended to outline the province's vaccine delivery plan yesterday, but a power outage at the legislature in Regina delayed that by a day.
 Vaccinations will happen in a staggered approach, with the plan being to inoculate health-care workers and vulnerable residents, such as seniors living in long-term care homes.

 Alberta
 Premier Jason Kenney says Alberta expects to start getting COVID-19 vaccines in the first week of January.
 High-risk patients and health workers will get them first.
 Kenney says his government has struck an interdepartmental team to roll out the vaccines from 30 different locations in the province.
 Dr. Deena Hinshaw, Alberta's chief medical officer of health, has said the province is expected to receive 680,000 doses of COVID-19 vaccine early in the new year, a figure not yet confirmed by the federal government.

 Nunavut
 Nunavut's chief public health officer says the territory will look to get the Moderna vaccine once it's available in Canada.
 Dr. Michael Patterson, says Moderna's vaccine is preferred because Pfizer's requires cold storage and shipping would be too difficult in Nunavut.
 Patterson says Iqaluit is the only community where it would be possible to store the Pfizer vaccine.
 Patterson says the territory's focus for vaccine rollout will be higher risk groups, such as elders. He says the rollout depends on how many doses Nunavut gets, which is still unknown.
 Lorne Kusugak, Nunavut's health minister, says he's been lobbying the federal government to make Nunavut a high priority to receive COVID-19 vaccines.
 __
 Yukon
 Premier Sandy Silver says he is meeting with the Prime Minister and his fellow premiers later this week to discuss plans for vaccine rollout.
 He says the goal will be to provide vaccines to elderly people and health-care providers.
 Silver says rural and remote communities should also get priority status in northern regions, a fact he says he's emphasized with federal authorities.
 The premier says he has joined the other provincial and territorial leaders in pushing for a national strategy to distribute the vaccine.
 Silver says the Pfizer vaccine could cause logistical problems for remote communities because of its cold-storage requirements, but those issues may not apply to other vaccines under development.

More than 50,000 ratings/petty officers serving on board Indian flag ships will benefit from the revised wage agreement signed on Monday.
 The National Maritime Board (India) wage agreement signed by the National Union of Seafarers of India (NUSI) covers seafarers working on harbour tugs for the first time, a NUSI statement said.
 The new wage pact, valid till December 31, 2023, will merge some of the allowances to reduce malpractices and simplify the tracking of actual entitlements for the seafarers.
 The new wage pact grants a 40% increase in wages for foreign-going ratings and 30% increase in wages for foreign-going petty officers; more than 20% increase in wages for home trade ratings and petty officers; and more than 10% and 7% increase in basic wages of offshore ratings and petty officers, respectively.
 Seafarers working exclusively on harboru tugs will get a 10% increase in overall salary from January 1, 2021 till December 31, 2022. They will get a further cumulative increase of 5% for the period of January 1, 2023 till December 31 , 2023.
 Apart from salaries, the death compensation amounts and the amount for death and disability compensation for seafarers on ships carrying radio-active material has also been increased significantly. The latest agreement also favours terms of re-employment, skill enhancement, reducing discrimination, increasing mental health awareness and creating robust grievance procedures for mariners, the statement added.

“You work with these trees all year and it all comes down to those four weeks of the year to make your money,” said Gavin Kross of Daniels’ Christmas Trees in Harding. “You don’t even factor your time and equipment into it or it would really be an eye opener.”
 Kross has 13 acres of Christmas trees that he runs as a “pick-your-own” operation. Customers choose their tree and Kross cuts it down and takes it to their vehicle.
 He said the second weekend following Thanksgiving is the busiest for sales, and despite the hectic pace it’s an enjoyable time of year.
 “For a lot of people, coming to get their tree at the farm is a chance to re- unite with old friends and spend some time together as a family,” Kross said. “I like it and it is a busy time, but the season goes by very quickly.”
 Roba said he doesn’t view the concentrated sales season as a financial risk because it remains fairly consistent each year. If you sell 1,000 trees one season, he said, you can expect to sell the same amount the following year because people want Christmas trees.
 Still, Roba said competition from artificial trees is shrinking the market for real trees by a small percentage, but the pandemic could change that this year.
 “Because of the outdoor appeal offered by farms, you might hang on to that 2-3% that would’ve switched to an artificial tree this year,” Roba said.
 On the supply side of things, consistency is replaced by cyclical trends when it comes to Christmas tree production. When the stock of trees decreases and prices rise, farmers plant more until the market becomes flooded and growers cut back until the next cycle of demand outpacing supply.
 According to Siegel, successful growers stagger their plantings so the trees don’t reach market size all at once. Five years ago, however, a large farm in North Carolina had 300,000 trees ready at the same time, and when those trees were cut and hit the market it created a glut, he said.
 “That has leveled off now and today there’s a demand again,” Siegel said. “We started getting lots of calls from customers and wholesalers looking for trees for resale on their lots.”
 This year, according to Roba, there’s a shortage of Christmas trees on the market and that could drive up prices for consumers. Businesses that buy from wholesale operations to stock their lots have had trouble finding trees at a reasonable price, he said. As a result, the resale businesses may be forced to pass on the increased costs to customers. According to the National Christmas Tree Association, the average cost for a live tree last year was $78.
 “You can’t take a loss intentionally. I check out prices all the time from resale lots and the big box stores, and I’ve definitely seen an uptick in prices over the last two years,” Roba said. “That could be a factor this year, but if the weather is good on the busy sales days, particularly weekends, people will find a way to come out and get their tree.”

The findings are in line with the efficacy level that AstraZeneca announced last month, which also showed 90% efficacy in a subset of volunteers who, it turns out, mistakenly got a lower first dose of vaccine. The data came from trials conducted outside the US, and AstraZeneca has yet to seek an EUA from the FDA.

Dal punto di vista economico, il costo dei tamponi è a carico interamente delle società che non hanno sinora ricevuto nessun contributo e la Divisione neanche lo ipotizza; parliamo di un costo che si aggira nella nostra città tra i 35/40 euro a tampone, che moltiplicato per il numero di persone e per il numero di partite da giocare raggiunge una cifra davvero impossibile da affrontare se sommato a tutte gli altri costi ordinari previsti per la stagione.

 Most importantly, the vast majority of the fighting (and the casualties) are now being born by the Afghan National Security Forces. As a result, we now have fewer than 10,000 coalition troops in country, a 95% drop from peak, most of whom were withdrawn under the Obama Administration. Coalition casualties are few and far between, and the Afghan government controls all the major population centers. Above all, a peace process--after many starts and stops --is taking hold, with the government and the Taliban sitting together and ironing out a process to move forward.
 But much is going wrong. The Taliban hold sway in many rural districts; they mount frequent attacks both in the countryside and occasionally in the major urban centers; Al Qaeda still has an operational presence and mounts occasional attacks and the influence of the Islamic State is rising; the Taliban still works with Pakistani intelligence services and moves across porous borders; and the production of narcotics continues apace, providing the Taliban with funds through taxation of opium crops. The confidence of the population has been shaken by the recent U.S. troop withdrawal announcement by the outgoing Trump administration, cutting the remaining 5,000 US troops by 50% to only 2,500. The European allies will probably match this reduction. This withdrawal, obviously not reflecting "conditions" in the country and done on a political timetable by Trump, is a mistake.
 I believe we can still succeed in Afghanistan. We no longer need 150,000 troops in country, but it will require some additional thought and effort if we want to end this long, painful and fraught mission. Doing so should be a part of the Biden national security team mission from day one.
