Abrams hasn't officially confirmed that he wants Reeves to return as Constantine, but resurrecting a live-action character with the original actor on board would certainly fit in with DC and Warner Bros.' current strategy. The studios appear to be building an interconnected multiverse housing all of their movie and TV properties, with Michael Keaton's Batman among the most notable characters tipped for a comeback.

PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. (WPBF/Hearst/CNN) - Police said a shooting that left three people dead, including a teenage girl, started with a court dispute over a dog.It’s not clear yet if the suspect took his own life or was killed by police gunfire.“If you heard this call come over the radio, it would make the hair on your neck stand up -- a little girl calls in saying ‘there’s someone shooting in our house, I think my parents are dead, I think my family is dead,’” St. Lucie County Sheriff Ken Mascera said.Port St. Lucie Police say the suspect and the victims were neighbors who were having a dispute about a dog that was deemed dangerous in court earlier Monday.“They all came home from court, and then the suspect armed himself and went to the victim’s house,” Mascera said.Port St. Lucie Police said when they responded to the scene around noon, they found an adult man dead and a 13-year-old girl critically injured. She died at the hospital.“The officers and deputies encountered the suspect who was inside the victim’s residence. They exchanged gunfire with the suspect. One of our officers was injured,” Assistant Chief Richard Del Toro sad.The officer who was shot is expected to be OK.The suspect then retreated inside the victim’s house, leading to a two-hour standoff. Police said at least two others were able to escape the house but were taken to the hospital.When SWAT arrived, they entered the home and found the suspect dead. It’s unclear how the suspect died.“It’s just shocking and it’s just tragic,” Del Toro said. “It’s not characteristic for this neighborhood or the city but we are going to do everything we can to find out all the reasons why.”A neighbor who said he heard gunshots thought they were fireworks because he never expected something like this to happen in their neighborhood.“Nothing like this has ever happened in the last 20 years. It’s a great neighborhood. Something as crazy as this happening over somebody getting emotional over a dog is unheard of,” Charles D’Agata said.Copyright 2020 WPBF, Hearst via CNN.

Arsenal are in talks over making Dani Ceballos' loan switch from Real Madrid permanent.


  The 23-year-old Spain midfielder had his season interrupted by a hamstring injury but has now started seven of the previous eight Premier League games and is thriving under Mikel Arteta.


  The Gunners are back in action against third-placed Leicester City on Tuesday, where building on their 2-0 weekend triumph at Wolves is vital in terms of maintaining their slim hopes of Champions League qualification.


  A strong finish could also make Emirates Stadium a more attractive long-term home for Ceballos.


  "Yeah, we are talking to [Real Madrid]," Arteta said.


  "Obviously we don't own the player, it is not in our hands. We need to have a communication and see what we can do."


  Ceballos' last-gasp winner against Sheffield United set up an FA Cup semi- final showdown with holders Manchester City and Arteta is impressed by the player's enthusiasm as much as his quality.


  "I'm really happy with him the way he is evolving. And, as well, I love how much he likes to play football, the passion that he puts in every training session and in every game," he added.


  "You have to see his celebrations. Whether he's on the pitch or on the bench, the way he celebrates the goals. He puts his life into it.


  "I'm really happy with him. I think he is evolving the right way and becoming a really important player for us."


  Such satisfaction applies across the board for Arteta, with Arsenal stringing together three consecutive Premier League victories since returning from lockdown with damaging losses at City and Brighton and Hove Albion.


  "I think the players are trying their maximum, the effort they put into every press, every duel. It's tough," he said.


  "Even at Brighton, where I was a little bit more critical, I never criticised the effort or the determination that they put in on the pitch; just some focus on the way that we competed in certain moments in the game to give chances to the opponent.


  "I am delighted with how the team is acting, how active they are, how alive they are, how hungry they are to compete and put everything into the game."


  Matteo Guendouzi remains an exception in this regard, however.


  The midfielder has not featured since the 2-1 loss to Brighton, with Arteta calling for Guendouzi and similarly jettisoned playmaker Mesut Ozil to be "100 per cent committed to our culture".


  Asked whether the situation with the 21-year-old Guendouzi should have changed since he issued the ultimatum, Arteta replied: "I don't know. The reality is that is hasn’t so we are still where we are."

Ronald "Butch" N. Hillesheim 78 of Nashua, Iowa died Friday, July 3, 2020 at Mayo Clinic Hospital - St. Mary's Campus in Rochester. A Mass of Christian Burial was held Wednesday, July 8, at Immaculate Conception Catholic Church in Charles City with Rev. Gary Mayer celebrating the Mass. Interment will follow at St. Michael's Cemetery in Nashua Ronald "Butch" Nicholas Hillesheim was born June 23, 1942, to Nicholas and Veronica (Marz) Hillesheim in Sleepy Eye, where he was the second oldest of five children. He grew up on a farm near Sleepy Eye and helped his parents with a variety of chores. Butch attended Sleepy Eye St. Mary's Catholic School and was a member of its Class of 1960. After graduation, he enlisted in the U.S. Air Force and worked as a mechanic. He was stationed at Hahn Air Force Base in Germany where he met and married Anna Drosse where their first daughter Patty was born. When Butch was honorably discharged, the family moved to his hometown, where he worked at a local coop and helped on the farm. Four more children - Sandy, Sonya, Terry and Becky - were added to the family, they later divorced. They remember their father as a hard worker and a jack-of-all-trades. Butch took a job with Moorman's Feed and he was transferred to Goldfield, then back to Sleepy Eye and then finally to the company's Plainfield plant and the family settled in Nashua. He married Nancy Betsinger on March 26, 1987, and his family grew to include Nancy's daughters - Chris, Shawna, Melanie and Janel. In 1988, he took a job as an electrician for Demro Electric in Nashua, where he worked until he retired in 2004. But Butch wasn't the retiring guy, so he worked at the coop, helped area farmers and delivered Zip's Trucking wreckers all over the country. Butch and Nancy loved to take weekend trips, and they always found time to be incredibly supportive of their 19 grandchildren and 14 great-grandchildren. Butch was the kind of guy whose dictionary didn't contain the word stranger. He could talk to just about anyone about anything. He also enjoyed gardening, his Oliver tractors and golfing, both the game on the course and socializing in the clubhouse. He believed in serving his community and his church. He was a member of St. Michael's Church in Nashua and served as finance chairman of the Parish Council and was a director of the St. Michael's Cemetery Board. He volunteered for 41 years at the St. Michael's Food Stand at the Big Four Fair and was known for the "Butch's Special." Butch served on the Nashua Town and Country Club Board of Directors, and he was a member of the Knights of Columbus and the Ralph W. Nicholson VFW Post 6792 in Nashua. Butch was a member of the Nashua Fire Department for more than a decade. He spent his life working hard and making friends, and he will be greatly missed by his wife, his children, his grandchildren, his great- grandchildren and the many friends he made in a life well lived.Butch is survived by his wife Nancy Hillesheim of Nashua, Iowa; one son, Terry (Shawna) Hillesheim of Nashua, Iowa; four daughters, Patty (Todd) Burkle of Monona, Iowa, Sandy (Bill) Harrington of Nashua, Iowa, Sonya (Dale) Matthews of Waverly, Iowa, Becky (Brad) Babcock of New Hampton, Iowa; four step-daughters, Chris (Scott) Siemons of Nashua, Iowa, Shawna (Terry) Hillesheim of Nashua, Iowa, Melanie (Kevin) Clipperton of Greene, Iowa, Janel (Jason) Wedeking of Parkersburg, Iowa; 19 grandchildren; 14 great-grandchildren; two sisters, Sharon Malecha of Lonsdale, MN, Sue (Tom) Schewe of Sleepy Eye, MN; one brother, Gary (Rosie) Hillesheim of Sleepy Eye; many nieces and nephews. He was preceded in death by his parents; one brother, Dean Hillesheim; great- nephew Caleb Fisher; brother-in-law Lester Malecha.

  Some of the protesters locked themselves into a barn to take photographs and raise awareness about conditions on the farm.


  The protest got the attention of the Alberta government, which overhauled the province's trespassing laws last November. The changes increased the maximum fine to up to $200,000 and possible jail time from $2,000 for a first offence.


  Animal rights groups have called the legislation the "Ag Gag Law" and have said it could affect those who are trying to expose wrongdoing or poor conditions on farms.

Similarly, "Sold" is more effective here.

Rey Rivera and his wife Allison originally moved to Baltimore so that Rey could accept a job writing newsletters at Rey's longtime friend Porter Stansberry's financial publishing company. The Netflix episode explains that Stansberry had wanted Rey to come join the company for a while, so when Rey's filmmaking dreams stalled, he decided to oblige his friend for a year or two and relocate for the role. Stansberry & Associates Investment Research, which is now just known as Stansberry Research, provides financial research and investment advice to its paid subscribers. At the time of Rivera's death, he was no longer writing newsletters but instead producing videos for Stansberry. The last call Rivera received before his disappearance was tracked to the switchboard of Stansberry & Associates, though who it was from remains a mystery.  
 In 2002, before Rivera joined the company, Stansberry & Associates came under fire for selling fraudulent advice to investors, and was sued by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Stansberry was found guilty of security fraud in 2007 and fined $1.5 million.
 The Netflix documentary claims that Porter Stansberry refused to speak to or cooperate with investigators or media following Rey Rivera's disappearance and death, and gag ordered his company's employees from doing so as well. On July 3, a spokesperson for the company disputed claims made in the Netflix episode, denying that Stansberry's employees had ever been barred from speaking about Rivera's case. "There was no gag order or direction given to employees to not speak to the press, law enforcement or any other party," a spokesperson for Stansberry Research told the Baltimore Sun last week.

The move by the publisher came after a New York appeals judge, ruling last week in response to a court action brought by the Trump family, decided it could proceed in releasing the book, “Too Much and Never Enough: How My Family Created the World’s Most Dangerous Man.”
 For the past few weeks, the Trumps, led by the president’s younger brother, Robert S. Trump, have been trying to stop publication of the book, which Simon & Schuster has said will detail the family’s “dark history” in an effort to explain how Donald Trump “became the man who now threatens the world’s health, economic security and social fabric.”
 Charles J. Harder, a lawyer for Robert Trump, did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment.
 Last week, a judge in Dutchess County, New York, temporarily halted the release, even though the book has already been printed — and is a prepublication bestseller on Amazon. The next day the appeals court judge decided that Simon & Schuster could go ahead with publication but did not address the question of whether Mary Trump had violated a confidentiality agreement with her family, as Robert Trump has alleged.
 That agreement was put in place nearly 20 years ago, when Mary Trump settled a lawsuit with her family concerning the contested will of the president’s father, Fred Trump Sr. But in an affidavit filed in New York last week, Mary Trump claimed she had consented to the secrecy pact — and signed away her interests in several family properties — without knowing that Donald Trump and his siblings had lied to her about how much they were worth.
 “Because the settlement agreement was based on and induced by fraud,” Mary Trump’s lawyer, Theodore J. Boutrous Jr., wrote in a court filing, “it cannot be enforced — and cannot bar publication of Ms. Trump’s book.”
 In his court papers, Boutrous claimed that the Trump family “significantly and deliberately undervalued” the appraisals of the properties, causing Mary Trump and her brother to agree to a buyout in which they were cheated out of millions of dollars.
 Under the agreement, she and Fred Trump III signed away their interests in several family real estate holdings, including the ground leases for the Beach Haven and Shore Haven apartments considered two of the “crown jewels” of Fred Trump Sr.’s empire.
 Boutrous has also claimed that it was preposterous that the Trump’s family’s secrecy agreement could be construed as a “sweeping, lifetime gag order” that could stop Mary Trump from writing about her family now. The president, as Boutrous pointed out, has given interviews about his sister, Maryanne Trump Barry, and his older brother, Fred Trump Jr. Dozens of books, Boutrous noted, have been written about the Trumps, including nearly 20 that the president wrote himself.
 In its statement announcing the sped-up publication schedule, Simon & Schuster offered a few new hints about the contents of the book, describing it as “an authoritative portrait of Donald J. Trump and the toxic family that made him.”
 According to the statement, Mary Trump, who is 55 and a clinical psychologist, explains how Donald Trump “acquired twisted behaviors,” including a penchant for seeing human beings in “monetary terms” and a habit of punishing qualities like “empathy, kindness and expertise.” In the book, the statement says, Mary Trump describes how her uncle “dismissed and derided” his own father as he succumbed to Alzheimer's disease and practiced “cheating as a way of life.”

Not only was Alma and Reynolds' meet cute partially improvised, but so was another one of the couple's defining moments in the film. One of the best shots in "Phantom Thread" takes place at the end of a New Year's Eve party as the two characters dance alone in a deserted concert hall. A spotlight beams down on Reynolds and Alma as they embrace, their love isolating them from the chaotic aftermath of the party that surrounds them. The crew revealed that shot was done on the fly after all the extras and the majority of the crew had left the set for the day. Anderson came up with the idea after seeing the abandoned set and wanting his characters to share a romantic moment in the now-quietness of the busy scenery. The director rounded up the crew that remained and got the shot in 30 minutes.

Cincinnati's Model Group has already invested $3.2 million into Ft. Wayne's historic business district, known as The Landing. Since the pandemic, businesses in that area along West Columbia Street have been struggling. Recently, the Allen County-Fort-Wayne Development trust acquired the properties on that street and will work to create a mixed-use site that will hopefully keep locals in business.


  "We have been looking for additional development opportunities in Fort Wayne," says Jason Chamlee, vice president of mixed-use development for Model Group, "and are excited to build off of the success of The Landing and continue the momentum and revitalization that is occurring downtown."
