Julián Castro is out of the race for president, but that effort left him well-positioned for future runs, including the one for the second spot on a national ticket later this year. If that doesn’t work out, there’s a fresh round of statewide races — from governor on down — on the ballot two years from now.


  Castro attacked his image as a soft-serve campaigner during the presidential race, poking fellow Texan Beto O’Rourke on immigration policy and 77-year-old former Vice President Joe Biden on his memory. Castro said later that it was not a shot at Biden’s age, though some Democratic debate viewers saw it that way.


  He never made much of a dent in the polls and never found traction in the financial primaries, where candidates go to find the financial patrons needed to compete in a modern presidential race. He started the contest, in practical terms, as the other Texan, behind the better-known former congressman from El Paso.


  O’Rourke has a particularly ardent fan base, built during his 2018 run for U.S. Senate against Republican Ted Cruz. His favorable showing in that campaign got national attention and is one of the main reasons that some Democrats from outside Texas believe the state might be in play this year.


  It fed some early excitement in O’Rourke’s presidential race, but his ardent fan base was louder than it was big in a presidential primary race with no Cruz to run against. President Donald Trump will have that role for the Democratic nominee in the general election, but in the crowded Democratic primary, O’Rourke didn’t stand out as an obvious alternative. The money wasn’t there, and neither was the support.


  That’s also true of Castro, except that he did more to change the conversation in the primary. He put down a marker on the very structure of the Democratic race and whether states like Iowa and New Hampshire represent the party and the country. Castro ended with much better odds of getting on the national ticket once Democrats choose a presidential nominee.


  O’Rourke did better as a presidential candidate if fundraising and most polls are your yardsticks, but Castro came out way ahead of his fellow Texan in the race for veep. O’Rourke fell from the heights while Castro climbed, comparatively speaking, from obscurity.


  Now, less than a week after he left the race, Castro endorsed U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, sparking new conversations about his vice presidential prospects. If that doesn’t work out, he hasn’t punched any other leading candidate hard enough to keep himself out of consideration if she’s not the nominee. He barely laid a finger on anyone but Biden, the only remaining candidate who might nurse a grudge, and the “memory” moment doesn’t appear to have left lasting injury.


  Castro’s from a big state. He’s Hispanic, potentially appealing to a large Democratic faction (though he didn’t catch on with those voters in polls on the way to the primaries). He would be a stark contrast to Vice President Mike Pence, assuming Pence stays on the ticket for Trump’s second run. And as he showed in the Democratic debates, he’s not afraid to go after a competitor.


  The odds are still long. Castro never constructed the kind of support that would turn a contender’s head. His fundraising was meager. San Antonio, where he was mayor, is one of the 10 largest cities in the country, but he is untested on statewide ballots here or anywhere else. And there are lots of other people who might be politically attractive to a nominee shopping for a veep.


  Make it a maybe.


  Don’t forget about what’s happening at home, though. The 2018 results turned heads in both political parties in Texas. Republicans still won the statewide races, but they won closer races than anyone has seen in years. And with the notable exception of O’Rourke, who became a political celebrity with heavy news coverage of the Senate race and with the $80 million he was able to raise for it, the Republicans did poorly against largely unknown Democratic challengers.


  It’s fair to say some of the Republican incumbents in those contests also remain largely unknown, but the party splits overall were tight. Democrats outdid their recent history in down-ballot races, winning two seats in Congress and a dozen in the Texas House away from Republicans.


  Should 2020, whoever wins here, continue that trend, Republicans will enter 2022 bolstering their defenses. Democrats will be putting their challenges together, looking for candidates with some experience and with — they hope — big names. O’Rourke might make that list. Castro, unless that national ticket beckons, could easily be there to meet him.

Manchester City midfielder Fernandinho has confirmed he is close to extending his contract at the club amid fears he could depart at the end of the season.


  The Brazilian has been one of City 's most important players since joining from Shakhtar Donetsk in 2013 and has gone from strength to strength under the guidance of Pep Guardiola .


  Fernandinho, 34, has spent the majority of the season playing as a central defender due to the long-term absence of Aymeric Laporte and was at his brilliant best during the 3-1 win against Manchester United in the Carabao Cup.


  Teammate Riyad Mahrez sparked fear that his teammate could follow David Silva out the exit door after claiming Fernandinho wouldn't be extending his stay.


  Nevertheless, after the win against United, Fernandinho claimed a new deal is in the pipeline due to an extension clause.


  "When I renewed at the end of 2018, we put a clause that if I reached certain goals, my contract would be renewed automatically," he told ESPN Brazil .


  "Conversations have already started, we talked about it last month.


  "I am close to reaching those goals and renewing the contract, but we can only confirm it after signing.


  "The club have already shown interest in me staying, I have also shown [my interest] in staying."

With a couple fortunate bounces here or there or a bit better effort and execution at times, the St. John’s Christian boys basketball team could have a record that really sparkles heading into the second half of the season.
 Still, the mark is solid as region play heats up. The Cavaliers improved to 7-4 overall after coasting past the Lowcountry Wildcats, 83-57, on Jan. 4.
 “We could be undefeated,” SJCA coach Drew Crowell said. “Sometimes we don’t put it all together for four quarters. We’ll play pretty good for one half or a quarter or four guys play great and the fifth one doesn’t engage. If you look back, there is some would’ve could’ve should’ve. We’ve got games where you look back and think what if we had played harder.”
 The Cavaliers have lost three games to Palmetto Scholars – two by single digits – and another one, 68-65, in overtime at Faith Christian.
 The start probably wasn’t helped by the fact football season ran into championship week and most of the depth being provided this season is from a group coming up from junior varsity.
 The Cavaliers opened up 1-2 before winning six of their next eight games and have their sights set on a spot near the top of the region standings with defending state champion Clarendon Hall.
 Juniors Nai’Ryan Bookert and Corey Moraux pace the Cavaliers in scoring. Bookert averages a team-high 19.7 points and Moraux adds 11.1 points a contest. Senior Evan Mizzell and junior Josh Legnard are on the cusp of double figures at 9.8 and 8.3 points.
 “Bookert has been unstoppable,” Crowell said. “Everything is funneled through him. This year, more than ever, I’ve seen him where he’s like I’m taking over the game. He’s got a couple dunks and he can score at every level.”
 On the other end, he’s guarded the “quickest kid on the court or a guy that has him by 100 pounds.”
 Moraux is keeping a steady hand on the ball from the point guard spot and Mizzell gives the Cavaliers a consistent shooter from beyond the arc.
 More consistent contributors to the scoreboard are senior Fletcher Law (7.1 ppg), sophomore Bryce Taylor (5.1 ppg), sophomore Matt Glover (4.2 ppg) and senior Rochard Tingue (4 ppg).
 Crowell called Law the heart and soul of the team for his work on defense against all comers and said Tingue is “my hustle guy.”
 “He’ll put his body out there and take a charge,” Crowell said. “He’ll do whatever it takes to make something happen.”
 January games include Clarendon Hall (home, Jan. 10), Jefferson Davis (at, Jan. 14), Andrew Jackson (home, Jan. 17), Dorchester Academy (away, Jan. 21), Holly Hill (away, Jan. 24) and Patrick Henry (away, Jan. 31).
 The Cavs play six games in Febuary before the playoffs open Feb. 21.
 Crowell believes the Cavaliers are postseason material, especially when they’re all locked in.
 “We’re at our best when we’re all engaged, when we’re all there and we’ve put all of our personal goals aside,” Crowell said. “You want your team to cheer for their teammates when they score. You want the team goal to be the most important.”

Ultimately, Maraniss writes, Lombardi decided to turn down Air Force to become an assistant coach with the NFL’s New York Giants.

TOPEKA -- As the Rev. Sarah Oglesby-Dunegan watched chaos unfold in the Senate chamber, where she brought proceedings to a halt in May by singing in the balcony and refusing to leave, she was thinking about the people who don't have health insurance and need it desperately.


  Oglesby-Dunegan, pastor at Unitarian Universalist Fellowship of Topeka, led eight other people in the brazen attempt to force a vote on Medicaid expansion on the final day of the legislative session.


  "I was thinking about the members of my congregation and the people I've met around the state who struggle every day to make ends meet, who work low-wage jobs and can't pay for health insurance, and how wrong that is," Oglesby- Dunegan said.


  The rise of civil disobedience at the Statehouse over the past 18 months, fueled by the Poor People's Campaign and supporters of Medicaid expansion, exposed a complex landscape where rules diverge from one floor to the next and sanctions are inconsistently applied by law enforcement. Republican leaders in the Legislature, the Democratic governor's administration and Capitol Police remain entangled in negotiations with the American Civil Liberties Union of Kansas over how to proceed.


  The protest in the Senate balcony revealed a widening fissure among stakeholders involved with safety and decorum in the Statehouse. The ACLU had filed a lawsuit weeks earlier after three Kansas State University students were detained by Capitol Police Officer Scott Whitsell and ordered to stay away from the Statehouse for a year. The ban was rescinded a day later.


  The students, joined by Oglesby-Dunegan and Leavenworth County resident Thea Perry, had lowered massive banners declaring Republican leaders of the House and Senate had "blood on their hands" for not expanding access to Medicaid health insurance to 130,000 low-income Kansas adults and children.


  The House passed a Medicaid expansion bill, but Republican leaders on the Senate side refused to allow a vote on the legislation, even though a majority of senators would have voted in favor of the bill.


  Oglesby-Dunegan said the impasse called for "extraordinary actions."


  "It's extraordinary for somebody to interrupt the Senate," she said, "and I certainly would never do that if I didn't feel like every level of the process was both nontransparent and non-accountable. We have leadership pulling tricks that prevent legislation from moving forward that clearly should move forward."


  When Oglesby-Dunegan refused to leave the balcony during the end-of-session demonstration, Capitol Police -- a wing of the Kansas Highway Patrol -- declined to force the issue. Whitsell later testified about the new approach. Police, who don't have the authority to arrest someone who hasn't committed a crime, no longer were willing to enforce administrative rules.


  For 20 minutes, Oglesby-Dunegan and her cohorts continued to sing and chant while lawmakers and the security team led by Tom Day, director of Legislative Administrative Services, struggled to find a resolution. The physically imposing Day hovered over the pastor while Senate President Susan Wagle's staff ordered the removal of media under the threat of losing floor passes to the Senate chambers.


  Police eventually forced the demonstrators to leave with the threat of arrest. Oglesby-Dunegan said she was issued a citation, although the district attorney hasn't filed charges.


  It isn't clear what will happen the next time a flagrant rule-breaker defies orders.


  "For us to proceed next session," said House Speaker Ron Ryckman, R-Olathe, "we need to have assurance that the highway patrol will not be told to stand down based on politics."


  Ryckman and Wagle, R-Wichita, expressed concerns with the ACLU lawsuit during a meeting in December of the Legislative Coordinating Council, the entity responsible for drafting administrative rules for the third, fourth and fifth floors of the Statehouse. The LCC includes the majority and minority leaders of both chambers, as well as the House speaker and Senate president.


  The rules set by the LCC were in conflict with a policy rolled out in October by Gov. Laura Kelly's administration, which has domain over the first and second floors. The new policy for the lower levels no longer restricts the use of signs or requires a legislator to sponsor an activity.


  Republican leaders prefer to retain their administrative rule banning anyone from carrying a sign into the Statehouse.


  "I think signs can be very dangerous," Wagle said. "They can be thrown. They can be on poles. They can hurt people. A rod on a sign can be very heavy, and it can be used as a weapon. We've never had signs in the Capitol in the past, and I don't believe we should have signs now simply because there are issues that we debate that people feel very strongly about, and there are people who want to oppress free speech, and there are people who when they get angry they lose their temper and they can hurt someone."


  Oglesby-Dunegan said it was "ridiculous" to suggest a sign is a security threat in a building where the concealed carrying of firearms is allowed.


  Settlement talks in the lawsuit revolve around an agreement proposed by the ACLU to allow small handheld signs, a compromise on the need to find a legislative sponsor for a demonstration, and a formal written policy by police for banning people from the Statehouse.


  "Some reaction obviously is appropriate if there's a disruption of session," said Lauren Bonds, legal director for ACLU of Kansas. "We're not saying that it's not appropriate for highway patrol or security or Tom Day to intervene."


  Bonds said it appears that Day and his staff have the authority to physically remove someone who violates rules.


  Oglesby-Dunegan said the possibility of ongoing protests would be determined by whether lawmakers move forward with a Medicaid expansion plan, as they have promised to do.


  She said she has "other interesting things" she could be doing, such as writing sermons.


  "I would much prefer to be the kind of citizen who writes a letter to the editor occasionally, shows up to watch what's happening, meets with my legislator, writes letters to them, has a more normal citizen advocacy relationship with government," Oglesby-Dunegan said.

Gov. Laura Kelly recommended Monday the state government pay off nearly $500 million in debt owed the Kansas Public Employees Retirement System and refinance the pension system's unfunded long-term liability to free up state tax dollars for other purposes.
 The Democratic governor said she would urge House and Senate members convening next week in Topeka to consider a package that included the debt and refinancing pieces.
 The GOP-led Legislature adopted a 20-year payment plan for debt repayment and had expressed limited support for reamortizing long-term pension liabilities.
 Kelly said in a statement the 2020 Legislature ought to promptly resolve a $477 million obligation to KPERS that under current law wouldn't be eradicated for two decades. Making a bulk payment to KPERS would save the state treasury about $200 million in interest payments.
 "We must act decisively to meaningfully reduce state debt, rebuild the state savings account and protect Kansas' ability to pay its bills in the long term," she said.
 Kelly said steps reducing the state's short-term annual payment to KPERS would be "sound, fiscally prudent tool often used in other states."      "I've always said that no political party holds the monopoly on good ideas," Kelly said. "Key elements of my plan were initially offered by Republican leaders in the past, and after reviewing carefully, I concluded that their idea merits consideration."
 If the refinancing proposal were enacted, the governor said, all retiree benefits would be safe despite extension of the time necessary to allocate sufficient money to cover liabilities far into the future.
 It would free up a projected $220 million in each of the next 15 years for appropriation to other areas of state government. However, the maneuver would cost the state billions of dollars to meet the unfunded liability in KPERS over a 25-year period rather than the current estimate of 15 years.
 "It costs $4.4 billion more for those 10 extra years," said Alan Conroy, executive director of KPERS.
 He said Kelly's proposal on refinancing wouldn't apply to the judges, police and fire or the local government sectors of KPERS.

You cannot be prepared for a goldilocks scenario all the time; anything can happen from anywhere. As investors, we need to focus on fundamentally strong companies which can weather any sort of macro issues that can crop up from anywhere, says Pramod Gubbi, Founder, Marcellus Investment Managers. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW. US-Iran tensions have thrown things a little up in the air very early in the year. What are you making of these developments?It is hard to predict these things. We are not geopolitical experts, but as investors, we need to construct scenarios and figure out how it affects our portfolios and our investment decisions. The clear ramifications if the tension escalates is clearly going to be through the oil price route, and through that to the fiscal deficit and inflation front where we already have issues. The macro bit is clearly negative. If this thing escalates, it will also create some sort of risk aversion in the markets and that means global capital flows into India will also be affected. So in more ways than one, it is a clear negative on the macro front. But as investors, we look at our portfolios, our companies and consider whether these changes affect the fundamentals of our companies. It is a timely reminder for us to focus on companies which are fundamentally strong and which have pricing power, even if oil is an input or a input commodity in those companies. If you have a competitive position strong enough to pass on prices down to consumers, you are relatively less hit. I am not saying you are totally immune but that again is a timely reminder for all of us to focus on strong companies with good competitive advantages, strong balance sheet which can weather through the storms because these are pretty much given these days in terms of stock markets. You cannot be prepared for a goldilocks scenario all the time; anything can happen from anywhere. As investors, we need to focus on fundamentally strong companies which can weather any sort of macro issues that can crop up from anywhere. I guess the litmus test is very soon. Later this week, Infy will be reporting its numbers though TCS has been delayed. Let us talk about automobiles. Would you say that the volume decay has now been arrested and can we finally see some green shoots? Or is this quarter going to be pretty stark too?The monthly data has been volatile and I do not think we can conclude one way or the other based on a few data points. We will need to see a sustained improvement in those numbers which we have not to be honest. I do not think we can call the bottom very early. It is difficult to pinpoint these bottoms in any case. I would rather take a longer term view. At some stage, over the next quarter or two you will see the bottom and some sort of recovery. If you have an horizon of three years or longer, you should start looking at autos. It is impossible to time it perfectly, but to the extent that valuations are reasonably below intrinsic values, you can look at building positions there. Whether this is the quarter where it turns around or not, is not going to make much of a difference in a longer term view. When it comes to capital goods, would you say that the commentary on order booking would continue to be bleak? Even after the tax cuts, we have not really seen any major infrastructure activity. If anything, everything is at a standstill.Absolutely. I think it is too early. We barely had a quarter. Even for companies which plan to capitalise on these tax cuts and start some capex activities, it will take time to go back to the drawing board and see how they can revisit in terms of new investment activities. I would reckon it is too early to look forward to in this quarter’s earnings commentary to see any sort of pick up in investment activity. We have already heard from some of the management teams that we have met over the last few quarters that there is absolutely no signs of pick up in capex activity, but having said that, I think at some stage there are well-run companies which are already looking at increasing their reinvestment plans. Clearly, the government has given a gift in the form of those excess cash flows which are retained with them and which they can choose to deploy. Some of these companies and sectors which have secular growth are clearly looking to deploy them. Whether it will be this quarter or next is anybody’s guess. But at some stage. you will see a pickup in investments. How are you looking at some of the non-banking lenders as well as the marquee private sector banks in light of the bad loan growth that we have seen?You will see a massive consolidation in lending in general. Going forward, we have already seen that the NBFC sector as a whole is shrinking but there are guys like Bajaj Finance who are growing at 35%, which is a massive consolidation or increase in market share and that I reckon is going to stay. The whole market will consolidate into a few hands which have had demonstrable track record in terms of growing the loan books with very reasonable NPAs, a very strong asset quality. The wholesale market will continue to provide capital to these guys and capital is an input for lenders. They will continue to use that position to consolidate. The same thing with the banking industry as well. Deposits have historically resided with the public sector banks but we are gradually seeing private sector banks eat into the market share of public sector banks on the deposit side as well. This will only strengthen their ability to take market share on the asset side though a handful of private sector banks and handful of NBFCs. If you pick the right one irrespective of the macro, irrespective of whether credit growth picks up in the system, these companies can continue to demonstrate loan growth simply by taking market share from those which are left behind. What about consumers? Do you think the persistent volume worries and the dip that one has seen coming in on the back of the sector being the biggest outperformer in the last 10 years could continue to play a spoilsport? Could we see any strategic move here and there with some of the rural-focussed companies managing to beat the storm?Generally, the country as a whole is seeing a slowdown I do not think even the stronger franchises within consumer will escape that. They will also see some sort of a slowdown in terms of volume growth. But having said that, one needs to watch out for deterioration in the competitive position or some of the better run franchises still growing faster than the rest of the industry. I guess at some stage, the mean reversion should happen if there is a pickup in the investment cycle. That will result in job creation, income generation and increase disposable incomes. That will ultimately benefit the consumer companies. So consumption growth will pick up eventually. You need to ensure that you are positioned in the best franchises which are continuing to grow faster than the industry despite the slowdown. As the recovery happens, these ones will be the first and the fastest to recover. What about defensives by way of earnings in terms of IT and pharma?Given where the currency is headed, IT and pharma clearly come up on most people’s radars. If the geopolitical situation escalates, you can see 75 on the rupee fairly quickly and you do need some exposure on IT and pharma if you are capitalising on the rupee depreciation. But would that be a near term trade, a knee-jerk reaction because of the geopolitical tensions? the knee jerk reaction that you are seeing in the dollar rupee parity?Given the state of our exports franchise and the exports competitiveness, the rupee depreciation is a given. The geopolitical crisis could just be a catalyst which accelerates that depreciation now. The markets are forward looking anyways and even before the earnings start to reflect the weaker rupee, you will see the stock prices reacting much faster than that. Any expectations from the Budget?We have had a reasonable set of announcements since August-September from this government towards improving the taxation infrastructure in the country. You should expect some more refinements on the direct tax front particularly in the personal tax front which should be a positive booster for the economy. Other than that I think the bigger thing to watch out for will be the fiscal deficit given that on the revenues front, the slowdown in the economy is clearly not helping the taxation but at the same time there is a need to simulate the economy through further expenditure on the behalf of the government. How does the government balance the twin requirements is what the Budget is all about. Anyway this year, it will be that much more important. The market will be a bit forgiving if you see a little bit of a slip up on the fiscal deficit as far as the revenue collection and the expenses numbers are credible. The market will be watching out for that.

The other big issue was how Apple would help law enforcement.

She insists that to access any user data that is not uploaded to iCloud, Apple would have to build a special software. While she insists Apple is working with law enforcement to support them as best it can, she did clarify that building such software wasn’t something that Apple intended to do. “Building back doors into encryption is not the way we are going to solve those issues,” she said.

NEW DELHI - Commercial airlines on Wednesday rerouted flights crossing the Middle East to avoid possible danger amid escalating tensions between the United States and Iran.
 The flight restrictions reflected fears that the conflict between the longtime foes could ratchet up following Iranian ballistic missile strikes Tuesday on two Iraqi bases that house U.S. troops. Those strikes were retaliation for the U.S. killing of Iranian Revolutionary Guard Gen. Qassem Soleimani in a drone strike near Baghdad last week.
 Australian carrier Qantas said it was altering its London to Perth, Australia, routes to avoid Iran and Iraq airspace until further notice. The longer route meant that Qantas would have to carry fewer passengers and more fuel to remain in the air for an extra 40 to 50 minutes.
 Malaysia Airlines said that “due to recent events,” its planes would avoid Iranian airspace.
 Singapore Airlines also said that its flights to Europe would be re-routed to avoid Iran.
 The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration said it was barring American pilots and carriers from flying in areas of Iraqi, Iranian and some Persian Gulf airspace. The agency warned of the “potential for miscalculation or mis- identification" for civilian aircraft amid heightened tensions between the U.S. and Iran.
 Such restrictions are often precautionary in nature to prevent civilian aircraft from being confused for ones engaged in armed conflict. The FAA said the restrictions were being issued due to “heightened military activities and increased political tensions in the Middle East, which present an inadvertent risk to U.S. civil aviation operations.”
 Following the FAA, India's Directorate General of Civil Aviation advised Indian commercial carriers to avoid Iranian, Iraqi and Persian Gulf airspace.
 The Russian aviation agency, Rosaviatsia, also issued an official recommendation for all Russian airlines to avoid flying over Iran, Iraq, the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman "due to existing risks for the safety of international civil flights."
 German airline Lufthansa said it had cancelled its flight from Frankfurt to Tehran on Wednesday in light of the current situation.
 At least two Kazakh airlines — Air Astana and SCAT — were considering rerouting or cancelling their flights over Iran following the crash of a Ukrainian plane that killed 176 people.
 The plane had taken off from Imam Khomeini International Airport in the Iranian capital when a fire struck one of its engines, said Qassem Biniaz, a spokesman for Iran's Road and Transportation Ministry.
 Kazakhstan’s officials said that Air Astana, the country’s flagship carrier, “is currently holding a meeting on whether to reroute or ban” flights. SCAT, one of the largest airlines in Kazakhstan, told Russia's Interfax news agency that they were also considering rerouting flights.
 United Arab Emirates-owned budget airline flydubai said it had cancelled a scheduled flight Wednesday from Dubai to Baghdad, but was continuing flights to Basra and Najaf.

Safe Place for Pets enjoys relationships with many caring veterinarian partners who donate and discount their services. Through these partnerships, each pet receives a thorough examination and clean bill of health before being adopted into a new home. Diabetes, thyroid and other health issues are addressed at this time.


  “Pets come to us needing significant oral care. Our vet partners give us deep discounts for the extractions that ease a pet’s pain and improve their health and happiness in the long run. But the thing Safe Place does that I find most meaningful is that we have a longer runway for the adoption process we call the pre-adopt stage,” Spencer said.


  The pre-adopt stage is when the organization spends time with the prospective adopter in their home to ensure if the cat or dog is entering into a safe environment. During this time the adopter and pet can live together for a week or month to ensure a suitable living arrangement. Otherwise, the pet is returned to Safe Place for Pets.


  “Bottom line, when we give someone who is at the end of their life our word that we are going to take great care of their pet and find it a wonderful loving home, we aim to do exactly that,” Spencer said.

The facility is a godsend for patients and families who find it difficult to cope with what will happen to a beloved pet once they’re unable to care for them. Oftentimes family members are unable to take on the care of the pet because of possible hardships and because of the animal mourning the loss of their owner and home.


  Such a situation can be painfully overwhelming for everyone involved and this is where Safe Place for Pets makes a difference, said Board Member Karen Spencer.


  “Because Safe Place exists for this purpose, we are able to go the extra mile to see that a good match is made between a prospective adopter and pet,” Spencer said.


  According to Spencer, a hospice nurse founded Safe Place 23 years ago after encountering a distressed patient who feared her pet would be euthanized following her death. Sympathetic of the patient’s concern, the nurse reached out to the community and found many citizens interested in finding a home for the creature. Safe Place for Pets was born.


  Despite its reputation, Safe Place often is regarded as Colorado Springs’ best-kept secret.


  “As we have seen so often, this is a real concern for many people and families who want peace of mind that a pet will be cared for and loved as they had been all their lives,” Spencer said.


  Spencer, who has two adopted cats herself, learned about Safe Place for Pets through an online announcement inviting community members to serve as fosters. The company’s mission inspired Spencer to volunteer in April 2019. She soon joined the board of directors.


  “There has never been any shortage of meaningful encounters with people who are surrendering a pet, those looking to adopt and the army of volunteers who give so much time to help families going through a tough time and ensure the pets are as well cared for as if they were their own,” Spencer said.


  Because of its mission, Safe Place for Pets is limited to assisting the pets of terminally ill individuals, Spencer said. “We have fewer animals in our care than most of the other wonderful shelters in Colorado Springs and across the state. We are able to devote more time to the people and animals and therefore provide a higher level of personal care,” Spencer said.

Dopo due anni di duro lavoro la riserva naturale del Monte Peglia, in Umbria, ha ottenuto nel 2018 il titolo Mab Unesco (acronimo di Man and the biosphere), il riconoscimento internazionale per la biodiversità. Un risultato brillante frutto dell'impegno e della tenacia di un comitato di cittadini, che hanno lavorato partendo dal basso e senza fondi o appoggi politici, per conseguire il prestigioso attestato. Questo è il video di presentazione della riserva, trasmesso alla riunione delle Riserve mondiali che si è tenuta a Roma il 18 dicembre 2019. "È un sogno diventato realtà - dice Francesco Paola, avvocato e presidente della Riserva Monte Peglia - il nostro non è un movimento politico ma culturale, inclusivo e aperto a tuti, volto alla diffusione di modelli sostenibili. La nostra Riserva è una intelligenza collettiva che vuole diventare globale".

So is Padukone's act an inflection point of sorts? Will it encourage other Bollywood A-listers to "stand up - and stand in" as a newspaper described her campus visit? The students' protest in India against Mr Modi's government is remarkable because it is has been led by civil society and not political parties. "In a sense, Padukone had captured the spirit of the moment. This is the politics of solidarity beyond ideology. So her presence in JNU was important," sociologist Shiv Visvanathan told me.
 Other are not so sure. In a sharply polarised country - pitting those who endorse Mr Modi's muscular Hindu nationalist politics against those who believe in a secular India - people who dismiss what they describe as "troublesome left-wing students" are not likely to be swayed by Padukone's visit.
 "I am also not sure that people who have criticised her will stop watching her films. Our public culture is not one of consistent ideological positions. It is far more ad hoc. We are capable of holding deeply contradictory opinions. We mostly live in a threshold society rather than one which has clear distinctions between good and bad, left and right. People, for example, support both a strong state and an open economy," Sanjay Srivastava, a professor and sociologist, currently at the Institute of Economic Growth, told me.
 To be sure, Padukone is not the only Bollywood heavyweight who has spoken out against Mr Modi's politics. A number of young female actors and well-known directors have attended protests against a controversial new citizenship law and the JNU campus attack. Anurag Kashyap, one of India's best-known directors, told a network last night that Mr Modi's government had "divided the country into two kinds of people - the anti-nationals and the patriots".
 Before meeting the students at JNU, Padukone told a news network that she was "pained" by what was going on.
 "It pains me because I hope this doesn't become the new normal. It's scary, and sad. This is not what our country's foundation was," she said. It is easy to be cynical about the politics of celebrities, but Padukone's remarks sounded like genuine anguish. "I think this is a very significant moment. She knows the consequences of speaking out, yet she has risked a lot of things by standing up," says film critic Shubhra Gupta. "Who knows what it will lead to? Will more stars speak out now?"
 Time will tell.

I was sitting around a table at a neighborhood party, enjoying the conversation with some friends before Christmas. The room was loud - the adults were speaking with raised voices, sometimes having to yell across the table at one another - because the nearby rooms were filled with the boisterous chaos that comes with a house full of kids.      But I took notice. Not because of the volume level. But because no one seemed to mind.      The kids, representing a wide range of ages, played video games in one room, while the adults talked in another room, and when things got too rambunctious, a parent stepped in to referee or supervise. But the adult conversation continued largely uninterrupted, as if the boisterous gang of children didn't exist in the next room.      At one point, when my 4-year-old daughter and 8-year-old son were wrestling a human-sized stuffed toy and my youngest ended in up in tears, I apologized for our kids' chaos as my husband stepped away from the adult table to separate our children.      I apologized again, before I realized something refreshing: No one was fazed by our chaos. Everyone at the small gathering had children of their own.      It was a refreshing reminder that every family comes with their own kind of craziness. It was a relief to be in an environment where we could be ourselves, and our kids could be themselves, too.      There is an old saying that children should be seen and not heard. It would be nice if every child were obedient and quiet and did as they were told - but I'm betting that even in my grandparents' day, that even though that was the expectation, there was still some chaos. It's par for the course, part of the territory. We can expect children to be appropriately behaved for a certain amount of time in certain situations - say, in church, at a funeral or at a nice restaurant.      Being the mom of three kids can be exhausting, trying to juggle a full-time job, the kids' busy extracurricular schedules and housework, I'm personally over the idea of trying to keep my children "perfect" all the time.      When my older kids were preschoolers, I'd dress them only in smocked and appliqued boutique clothing. My oldest daughter wouldn't leave the house without a bow in her hair. We expected the kids to behave perfectly, all the time, the second they stepped out our door. But more often than not, we ended out more stressed because one kid ended up with Kool-Aid spilled down their white smocked dress or another kid got gum stuck in their hair or because one of our kids whined at a restaurant and we were worried we'd disturb the other patrons (when, in fact, no one else noticed.)      Eventually, my kids grew out of the smocked-and-appliqued phase. My youngest daughter refuses to wear hair bows at all. And while my younger self would have balked at the idea of buying a printed T-shirt for my little one, my youngest daughter refuses to wear anything "fancy." She rocks her favorite glitter-embossed unicorn T-shirt and leggings happily.      As I've gotten older, I guess I've learned to care less, not about my kids, but about what other people think.      Trying to make children be "perfect" all the time causes too much mental strife and too many gray hairs to be worth it. And staying inside the house for 18 years isn't an option. I hope that other people understand. We try our best. But nobody is perfect.      And while we teach children to behave, we shouldn't ask them to conform to a robotic ideal that's abnormal for who they really are. Sometimes it's refreshing to just be real. And sometimes, that means a little chaos.   Lydia Seabol Avant writes The Mom Stop for The Tuscaloosa News in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. Reach her at lydia.seabolavant@tuscaloosanews.com.

In the lead-up to Canada legalizing same-sex marriage in July 2005, those on the far right of the religious spectrum chanted repeatedly that it was the end of society as we had known it, effectively letting us know that hell awaited.   Conversely, I looked at it as a good thing, that society was finally accepting that not everyone was hooked up the same and was finally prepared to make allowances for it.   And now, nearly 15 years later, with the sky not having fallen on us or the earth opening up to swallow us, it would seem that everything has nicely fallen into place.   But, I have to acknowledge, there are still many pockets of resistance, within this country and without.   At the Anglican Church of Canada's general synod in Vancouver in July, a resolution to change the definition of marriage by deleting the words "the union of man and woman" failed because of a lack of support from among the bishops.   And last week the United Methodist Church, the second-largest Protestant denomination in the United States, announced a plan that would formally split the church, citing "fundamental differences" over same-sex marriage.   And there still are many countries in which just being a homosexual is against the law, where a great risk is taken just in taking a step out of the closet.   I actually hold some hope for the Anglicans, who comprise the third-largest religious denomination in Canada, as it was only the bishops who voted against the resolution.   The laity voted 80.9 per cent in favour, easily passing the required two- thirds threshold, and the clergy cleared it easily too, voting 73.2 percent in favour.   But among the bishops, only 62.2 per cent voted yes. Two bishops abstained, 14 voted against, and 23 voted in favour.   The news stories didn't mention anything about the age of those voting but I imagine most of the bishops would be among the most elderly.   Time, I believe, considering the bishops were so close to the required 66 per cent will take care of this problem within a very few years.   And I have no doubt this could be the case eventually in the U.S.   As a story in the New York Times about the split pointed out, although 53 per cent of church leaders are in favour of continuing the ban on same-sex marriage, a Pew Research Center study from 2014 found that of a plurality of American Methodists who consider themselves conservative, six in 10 believed that homosexuality should be accepted and nearly half favoured same-sex marriage.   The plan to split would sunder a denomination with 13 million members globally -- roughly half of them in the United States -- and create at least one new "traditionalist Methodist" denomination that would continue to ban same-sex marriage as well as the ordination of gay and lesbian clergy.   The story indicated it is likely that the majority of the denomination's churches in the United States would remain in the existing United Methodist Church, which would become a more liberal-leaning institution as conservative congregations worldwide depart.   I take heart that all this will mean change for the better, especially after reading what former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, a Baptist, said in an interview webcast on the Huffington Post back in 2015.   "Former President Jimmy Carter -- nicknamed in Baptist circles the world's most famous Sunday school teacher -- said that he 'thinks Jesus would approve of same-sex marriage,'" Bob Allen of Baptist News Global wrote in picking up the interview.   "I believe Jesus would approve gay marriage, but that's just my own personal belief," the 39th president of the United States said. "I think Jesus would encourage any kind of love affair if it was honest and sincere and was not damaging to anyone else, and I don't see that gay marriages damage anyone else."   Carter, who on Sundays at the time taught Sunday school at Maranatha Baptist Church in Plains, Ga., said he didn't "have any verse in scripture" to back up his opinion, but as a born-again Christian he had no problem with gay marriage.   "I think everybody should have a right to get married, regardless of their sex," Carter said. "The only thing I would draw a line on, I wouldn't be in favor of the government being able to force a local church congregation to perform gay marriages if they didn't want to. But those two partners should be able to go to a local courthouse or to a different church and get married."   He is a man after my own heart.   I have never been able to understand how some people are unable to understand that being gay is not a choice, it is built-in from birth. If there is a choice, I would say to the religious, it was their God's choice.   I am just glad I saw the light early.   There was a time that I objected to benefits proposed for gays living together, believing it could be abused by any two people of the same sex sharing an abode.   But in a column in The Sault Star in1994 I said I was doing a 180-degree turn, now agreeing that this was the thing to do.   I even said in the column that I would not have any objection to same-sex couples being allowed to marry, which did put me a little ahead of the times.   It has been a long haul but I think there is hope that over time more and more countries, as the more tolerant and acceptable thinking of the young replaces the implacability of the old, will accept that those in the homosexual community have the same right to marry as those in the heterosexual community do.

Reasonable people will debate the likeliest ramifications of President Trump’s decision to order the killing of Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, the Revolutionary Guards Corps commander whose power in Iran was second only to that of the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei — and whose power in Lebanon, Syria and Iraq was arguably second to none.


  What shouldn’t be in doubt is the justice.


  By far the best account of Suleimani’s life was written by Dexter Filkins for The New Yorker in 2013. It’s worth reprising some of the details.


  In 1998, Suleimani assumed command of the Quds Force — the Guards’ extraterritorial terrorist wing — whose prior exploits included a role in the bombing of a Jewish community center in Buenos Aires that killed 85 people.


  In 2003, Filkins wrote, “Americans received intelligence that Al Qaeda fighters in Iran,” operating with Tehran’s protection and consent, “were preparing an attack on Western targets in Saudi Arabia.” Despite U.S. warnings to Iran, terrorists “bombed three residential compounds in Riyadh, killing 35 people, including 9 Americans.”


  In 2004, Suleimani “began flooding Iraq with lethal roadside bombs” known as explosively formed projectiles, which, according to retired Gen. Stanley McChrystal, “killed hundreds of Americans.”


  In 2005, the former Lebanese prime minister, Rafik Hariri, and 21 others were killed in a massive car bombing in Beirut, carried out by Hezbollah. “There were Iranians on the phones directing the attack,” one former C.I.A. official told Filkins. “If indeed Iran was involved, Suleimani was undoubtedly at the center of this.”


  In 2006, Hezbollah operatives abducted and killed Israeli soldiers in an operation that, according to Filkins, was “carried out with Suleimani’s help.” It sparked a monthlong war in which thousands of people were killed.


  There’s a great deal more of this. And that was just the preamble to his central role in rescuing Syria’s Bashar al-Assad and sustaining Yemen’s Houthi militia in power, goals pursued through policies of unrestricted brutality. As an agent of international mayhem, Suleimani’s peers were Osama bin Laden and Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. To think of him as a worthy adversary — an Iranian Erwin Rommel — is wrong. He was an evil man who died as he had killed so many others.


  The proximate reason for Suleimani’s killing, according to a Defense Department statement, is that he “was actively developing plans to attack American diplomats and service members in Iraq and throughout the region.” If so — and it hardly stretches credulity that he was — the strike was an act of pre-emption. No U.S. president, of any party, should ever convey to an enemy the impression it can plot attacks against Americans with impunity. To do otherwise is to invite worse.


  Trump’s problem is that, until Thursday, that’s what he had done. For almost a year, an escalating series of Iranian attacks on U.S. and allied assets were met by a conspicuous failure to respond militarily. Trump also kept signaling his desire to withdraw U.S. forces from the region.


  The result was to embolden the Iranians to hit harder. Instead of a calibrated cycle of escalation matched to a tacit sense of limits, the Iranians reached until they overreached. On Wednesday, Khamenei taunted Trump with the message that “there is no damn thing you can do.” The supreme leader is now a publicly humiliated man. That is enormously satisfying — and immensely dangerous. Rashness often springs from wounded pride.


  One possible outcome is that a spooked Iranian leadership, already reeling from devastating sanctions and mass demonstrations, will prefer to tread lightly, at least for the time being. “Suleimani’s death could bring a sense of realism to the Islamic Republic’s thinking,” says the Iranian-American journalist Masih Alinejad. For 40 years, the regime has succeeded abroad because it’s been willing to play dirty games against generally feckless opponents. It may now take its time to reassess that view.


  The alternative? Iran could mount a global campaign of terrorist strikes, deploying foreign proxies like Hezbollah for political deniability. It could try to take hostages at the American Embassy in Baghdad, much as it did at the embassy in Tehran in 1979. It could use its influence in Iraq to demand the expulsion of U.S. troops — “accomplishing in the wake of his death what Suleimani long tried to accomplish in life,” as Mark Dubowitz of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies observes. And it could accelerate its nuclear program, forcing Trump into a major military confrontation he has been eager to avoid, especially in an election year.


  The next days will be decisive. The best course for the United States is to spell out clearly to Iran what the paths of escalation — and de-escalation — hold. On the de-escalatory side, a return to the status quo ante and a willingness to explore negotiations over the full range of Iran’s malign activities, including its regional aggression and expanding nuclear program, in exchange for the easing of oil and other economic sanctions. On the escalatory side, a policy of deliberately disproportionate retaliation to any Iranian aggression, no matter whether it’s carried out by Iran or its proxies, and no matter whether it aims at us or our allies.


  The clearer we are in limning the courses of hope and fear, the likelier we are to achieve a stable balance between them.

Franchise systems are picky. But JDog Junk Removal & Hauling might be the most selective of all. The Berwyn, Pa.-based company sells units exclusively to military veterans and their families -- no exceptions -- and hires as many veterans as possible to clean out, transport and repurpose customers' junk. It's great marketing. When a JDog crew shows up to do a job in camouflage trucks and trailers and military-style uniforms, it's hard not to take notice.
 "When these guys walk into the consumer's home, people instantly respond and say, 'Thank you for your service,'" says Army veteran Jerry Flanagan, who began franchising the brand in 2013 and now has 21 units operating in seven states. "It makes marketing much easier because we are able to show how we are different. We're able to penetrate new markets quickly. People really want to get behind veteran-owned and -operated businesses."
 When he launched his business in 2011 in a Philadelphia suburb, he didn't plan to employ a post-military work force, though he did hire as many veterans as he could. What he found was that employees with a military background often had better leadership skills and were more likely to follow his systems than other staffers. They showed up on time, caused few problems and took pride in their work.
 "I'm not really looking for entrepreneurs to be my franchisees," Flanagan says. "I'm looking for guys who can follow orders and can look at my playbook and follow it effectively."
 While JDog's vets-only policy is unique, Flanagan is not alone in realizing that veterans have skills that make them great franchisees. In fact, over the past decade, franchise systems have made aggressive efforts to recruit military veterans, offering discounts, incentives and even free equipment to get them through the door.
 But it has taken time for franchise brands to fully realize the potential of the veteran community. In 1991, at the end of the first Gulf War, Don Dwyer, founder of the Dwyer Group of franchises that include Mr. Rooter and Glass Doctor, started a program called VetFran, which was a loose affiliation of franchise brands that recruited vets to help them transition to civilian life.
 Over the next decade and a half, the program had periods of high and low activity, but in 2007, as increasing numbers of those who'd served in Iraq and Afghanistan began transitioning out of the military, member brands ramped things up. VetFran became a program of the International Franchise Association designed to educate vets about franchising and connect them with companies offering incentives.
 In 2011 VetFran launched Hiring Our Heroes, a program aimed at bringing 80,000 veterans into the franchise industry; as of 2014, it had brought 203,890 former service members into the fold, including 5,608 franchisees. Today VetFran comprises nearly 700 franchise brands.
 "In February I visited with Budget Blinds, which waives their $75,000 franchise fee for veterans," notes George Eldridge, program manager of VetFran, who left active duty in 2012. "They were so impressed by the vets they'd worked with that they wanted more. That was nice to hear. Here's a company making decisions not on what vets have done in the past, but what they can do now. No vet wants a handout. All the franchise brands I talk to say the same thing: They wouldn't be doing their vet programs if there was no return on investment."
 Former Navy SEAL Monty Heath is executive director of VetToCEO, a Marietta, Ga.-based nonprofit that offers free online programs for veterans exploring entrepreneurship. He believes franchising is perfectly suited to the mentality of many veterans.
 "These guys learn leadership and perseverance in the service. They are hard- working and mission-focused, and they complete the task in front of them no matter what," Heath explains. "Guys and gals in the military are very much used to giving orders and executing. That's how franchising is. They're given a playbook and they figure out how to execute it. The military mind is set up to be in that environment. That's what a veteran provides vs. someone who has to start from scratch learning how to run a business."
 Mosquito Joe, a franchise system based in Hampton Roads, Va., home to several large military installations, is investing heavily in veterans; some 15 to 20 percent of its franchisees are former service members. While the company offers a $2,500 discount on its franchise fee to veterans, COO Brian Garrison, who left the military in 2012, believes vets are attracted to the brand's culture. Many members of Mosquito Joe's corporate team also served in the military.
 "We feel vets bring the right set of experiences and work ethic to our business," Garrison says. "Veterans coming through the pipeline look at the other vets in our system, and it resonates with them. Our team has close to 100 years of franchise support experience. We can look veterans in the eye and say, 'We understand that you don't have any experience in the private sector. But we can be a backstop for you as you make the transition.'"
 Indeed, Mosquito Joe's culture resonated with Dennis Corrigan from the start. He grew up in a military family and spent the first 24 years of his adult life as a U.S. naval aviator. After retirement from the cockpit, he spent the next 17 years on the fringes of the Navy designing training materials for pilots and air crews. When he decided to go into business for himself, he signed on with Mosquito Joe and launched his unit in Virginia Beach, Va. "I found that because of their focus on the military and because we have the same values, it made it much nicer to interact with them," he says. "I was able to build relationships with corporate almost immediately based on our common work ethic."
 Corrigan is paying his success forward by primarily hiring veterans and firemen on his crews, which control mosquitoes in homeowners' backyards and in outdoor areas before events. "I have found that folks from the military have a different commitment to the job," he says. "They understand a lot about customer service, although they may not know they're doing it. They are really good at completing a job to the best of their ability and on time."
 Jan-Pro, the 10,000-unit commercial cleaning franchise, and its recently launched residential cleaning brand Maid Right, have sought to employ former service members since 2000, when the company launched its VetConnection Program. The Alpharetta, Ga.-based company offers a 10 percent franchise-fee reduction for vets. Because of its master franchisee model, the company aims to find individuals who have experience managing large groups of people.
 Scott Thompson, vice president of franchise development for Jan-Pro and Maid Right, looks to match the right veteran with the right opportunity. "I probably wouldn't give an infantryman who never managed a larger unit a master franchisee license, and I probably wouldn't give a major who worked hard to learn leadership skills a small package," he explains. "We try to align our opportunity to a veteran's goals, skill set and capital."
 Thompson adds that many service veterans have the advantage of a military pension, which gives them a level of security that other prospective franchisees may lack. "That pension gives them flexibility," he says. "They have some income already as they're ramping up their business. In some cases, what they make from their franchise is just gravy. They can take the time to build their business up correctly."
 Eric Freeman, who served in the Gulf War and now works as a Dallas policeman, started his Maid Right franchise last May. By August, he'd exceeded his personal goals by signing up more than 60 clients in his first six months. "The military made me goal-oriented and driven," he says. "I grew up in a military family and learned discipline. I won't sit around and wait for someone to do something for me."
 Workout Anytime, an Alpharetta-based fitness franchise, reduces its $30,000 franchise fee by a third for vets. Co-founder and president John Quattrocchi says the past few years remind him of when he returned home from Vietnam after serving four years in the Air Force.
 "It seems like an awful lot of people are coming home from Iraq and Afghanistan and are looking for work, and we have a great need for people with the tools they've learned to help us expand," he says. "When I came home in the '60s we faced the same thing. I was able to get a job in a steel mill after college, but a lot of friends who served in Southeast Asia couldn't find a job. I certainly have a soft spot for veterans. We should give back to anyone who serves their country."

The Green New Deal offers a way forward and away from the Jobs vs. Environment paradigm that powerful corporations have bombarded us with for decades, and that serves their bottom line by dividing groups who should be allies. Aside from the Green New Deal, our building trades unions need other labor, community and progressive allies to fight the spread of non-union construction, especially in large commercial buildings. But to HAVE allies, we need to BE allies with these groups. An alliance with Big Oil is exactly the wrong way to go, and it will greatly hinder the alliances we need to make.

SHAHEDSHAHR, Iran - Dozens of Canadians were among the 176 people killed in a plane crash just minutes after taking off from the Iranian capital's main airport, Ukraine's minister of foreign affairs said.
 Vadym Prystaiko said 63 Canadians, 82 Iranians and 11 Ukrainians were on board— the Ukrainian nationals included two passengers and the nine crew. There were also 10 Swedish, four Afghan, three German and three British nationals.
 The crash, which killed everyone on board, happened Wednesday morning hours after Iran launched a ballistic missile attack on two Iraqi bases housing U.S. soldiers, but both Ukrainian and Iranian officials say they suspected a mechanical issue brought down the Boeing 737-800 aircraft.
 Global Affairs Canada did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
 Airline officials said most of the passengers were en route to the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, transiting through there to other destinations.
 Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy extended his condolences to the families of the victims. His office said he had cut his visit to Oman short and was returning to Kyiv because of the crash.
 "Our task is to establish the cause of the crash of the Boeing and provide all necessary help to the families of the victims," said parliament speaker, Dmytro Razumkov, in a Facebook statement.
 Ukraine International Airlines said it had indefinitely suspended flights to Tehran after the crash.
 "It was one of the best planes we had, with an amazing, reliable crew," Yevhen Dykhne, president of the Ukraine International Airlines, said at a briefing following the crash.
 Zelenskiy, the Ukrainian president, ordered a sweeping inspection of all civil airplanes in the country, "no matter the conclusions about the crash in Iran."
 The plane had been delayed from taking off from Imam Khomeini International Airport by almost an hour. It took off to the west, but never made it above 2,400 metres in the air, data from the flight-tracking website FlightRadar24 indicates.
 It remains unclear what happened. Qassem Biniaz, a spokesman for Iran's Road and Transportation Ministry, said it appeared a fire struck one of its engines. The pilot of the aircraft then lost control of the plane, sending it crashing into the ground, Biniaz said, according to the state-run IRNA news agency.
 Hassan Razaeifar, the head of air crash investigation committee, said it appeared the pilot couldn't communicate with air-traffic controllers in Tehran in the last moments of the flight. He did not elaborate.
 Ukrainian authorities have offered to help with the investigation of the plane crash.
 "We're preparing a group of specialists in order to help with the search operation and the investigation of the cause of the crash," Honcharuk said.
 The plane, fully loaded with fuel for its 2,300-kilometre flight, slammed into farmland near the town of Shahedshahr on the outskirts of Tehran. Videos taken immediately after the crash show blazes lighting up the darkened fields before dawn.

Twenty years after his sale to the Yankees, and five years following his retirement, Ruth spent a week in Colorado Springs in July 1940. He stayed at The Broadmoor with his wife, Claire, and put on a hitting exhibition in town. He also toured the area, visiting such places as Bear Creek Canyon, High Drive, Garden of the Gods and Seven Falls. He spent time with kids at the Myron Stratton Home and played a round of golf at The Broadmoor.


  The Babe also put on a hitting exhibition in Pueblo at Runyon Field during his time here.


  Thirteen years earlier, in 1927, following his record-setting 60-homer season, the Babe and Yankees teammate Lou Gehrig went on a three-week postseason exhibition tour that included a stop in Denver. Ruth’s team was called the “Bustin’ Babes,” while Gehrig’s team was known as the “Larrupin’ Lous.” The Babe hit a home run off Gehrig in the game played in Denver.


   _Some other things to consider:_


  • Don Larsen, the only man to ever pitch a perfect game in postseason history, died on Jan. 1 at the age of 90. Larsen pitched his gem for the Yankees on Oct. 8, 1956, against the Brooklyn Dodgers in Game 5 of the World Series. I had the honor of interviewing Larsen in the early 1990s when I caught up with him at an old-timer’s game in Anaheim. He and I talked about his perfect game, but in later years he was less interested in sharing his memories about that game and more inclined to talk about getting sober and forgiving himself. He said the only thing that matters in one’s life is progress and becoming a better human being.


  • When was the last time a Lewis-Palmer boys’ basketball team was not in the top 10 of the CHSAA RPI standings? Never. The RPI standings have been in effect since the 2016-17 season and the Rangers have always been in the top 10. The Rangers lost in the Class 4A state finals that season. They also lost in the finals in 2017-18. Lewis-Palmer won the state title last year by going 28-0. This year’s team is 5-2 and was 15th in the RPI standings as of Jan. 4.


  • I always enjoy watching the Rose Bowl and love it when Chris Fowler calls the game on ESPN. Fowler, in case you are not aware, is a 1980 Palmer High School graduate, He has worked for ESPN in various capacities since 1986. He is also a graduate of the University of Colorado.

Ayoub worked for the Independent for 21 years before retiring in 2015. He also taught journalism and ethics at Grand Island Senior High School. He currently teaches for Doane University at its Grand Island campus at College Park.
 “Confluence” is not Ayoub’s first book; he has written several fiction novels that were serialized in the Independent.
 Ayoub said he was approached by Frank Parch, former World-Herald editorial board editor, who works with the Carmen and John Gottschalk Foundation, which is a charitable foundation founded in 2006, to write a book about Gottschalk.
 “We met in Grand Island and he told me what they wanted to do,” Ayoub said. “I knew who John Gottschalk was. I heard him out and I was interested, but I wasn’t sure that I could pull it off — writing a biography.”
 After consulting with friends about the proposition, he met with both Gottschalk and Parch about the project.
 “It was important to me that he (Gottschalk) was on board and an active participant,” Ayoub said. “He is a very humble guy, but he is a great storyteller. That was huge for me, so we started in May (2016).”
 The book was published late last year and Ayoub is publicizing it. He will host a book signing from 2 to 4 p.m. Sunday, Jan. 26, at the Grand Island Public Library. At 3 p.m., he will talk about how he came to write the book, along with a question-and-answer session with the audience.
 The book is published by Teewinot Publishing c/o Concierge Publishing Service out of Omaha.
 During the last three and a half years, Ayoub did his research. He learned about Gottschalk’s life in Nebraska journalism — from his small-town beginnings in Rushville to being publisher of the state’s biggest newspaper. Gottschalk’s family owned the weekly paper in Rushville.
 The Grand Island Independent was purchased by the Omaha World-Herald in 2008. The World-Herald was purchased by BH Media, which is a Berkshire Hathaway Company based in Omaha, in 2011.
 “He (Gottschalk) grew up in a newspaper family and his first job was at the end of a broom sweeping up the press room,” Ayoub said.
 From that background, Ayoub said Gottschalk learned all parts of how a newspaper operates. After attending college at the University of Nebraska in Lincoln, Gottschalk entered the family business and eventually became the owner and publisher of the Sidney newspaper in his 20s. He worked at the Sidney newspaper for 10 years before joining the World-Herald, where he worked his way up to become the paper’s publisher 14 years later.
 “He has a tremendous mind for journalism and business,” Ayoub said. “One of the things I learned in writing this book was that he sees the big picture and the details.”
 He said Gottschalk not only understood the fine details of running a newspaper but also had a handle on the bigger picture of what a newspaper represented to the people of the community it serves.

“I can walk out of this locker room tonight, lose by 10 and be pretty happy about that,” Hartz said. “When we force teams the way we want to play, like we did in the second half, there isn’t a team in Class 4A we can’t take the floor against and be in the game in the fourth quarter. We got the shots, we just didn’t make them, and I’ll take that over turnovers late in the game.”


  Trae Swartz, the 4A scoring leader, was largely a nonfactor in the game with just 11 points, 14 below his season average. In his place, however, were several players who stepped up with strong all-around games. Kie Glosser scored 14 points to lead the Bulldogs in scoring as eight different players scored.


  That is more the balance Hartz wants for his team, despite Swartz’s early- season dominance.


  “Trae can score 32 points in a game, but more importantly, he’s a team player. He could score two points, but he just wants to win,” Hartz said. “He was kicking the ball outside tonight to Kie, and Kie hit threes.


  “We’ve been preaching since Christmas to have that third or fourth scoring option,” he said. “Teams will have to guard us then.”


  Ankeny’s guard tandem of Jaxon Smith and Braxton Bayless was a bit too much to overcome. Smith scored a game-high 20 points and Bayless added 18, but Smith managed just four points in the second half as Ottumwa asserted itself with strong defense.


  The Hawks (7-1), who received votes in 4A in the Associated Press poll, jumped out to a 20-8 lead on the strength of wide-open shooters hitting from the outside, as well as a dribble-drive that was quick enough to the basket to avoid charges.

Institutional dynamics are also a factor. Japanese judges and prosecutors are cut from the same cloth, specialized categories of elite bureaucrat who pass the same exam as lawyers but follow a separate path. Despite constitutional separation of powers, the judiciary and the Justice Ministry (which is run by prosecutors) exchange personnel: At any given time more than 100 judges are on secondment to the executive branch as temporary prosecutors, and at least one bureau at the Justice Ministry is usually headed by a judge.


  Meanwhile, Japanese judges are subject to frequent transfers and annual personnel reviews by judicial administrators (judges themselves), the results of which can affect the timing of their next pay raise and whether their next post will be a good one or not. Not annoying judicial administrators is a factor in a successful judicial career, and judicial administrators have an institutional interest in maintaining good relationships with the Justice Ministry, which, among other things, reportedly represents the judiciary's interests in the Cabinet.


  Unsurprisingly, by all accounts judges who end up being posted to criminal courts are usually pro-prosecutor. While Japan's 99.9 percent conviction rate can be attributed in part to de facto plea bargains — just as in countries like the United States — the prospects for those asserting their innocence are almost as dismal. In Japan, conviction rates for those defendants are still more than 97 percent, compared to the United States, where the rate for acquittal at trial is over 15 percent.


  Not only that, but in the unlikely event a defendant is acquitted, prosecutors can appeal and expect to win. That's right, not even being found not guilty by a trial court is enough to establish a "reasonable doubt." You may even be kept in detention while the mistake is remedied by a higher court.


  In some high courts the rate of acquittals being overturned by a conviction is said to be close to 100 percent. Acquittals on appeal are a rarity but prosecutorial appeals mean that any acquittal can take a lifetime to be confirmed. Nursery school teacher Etsuko Yamada was arrested in 1974 for the murder of two children under her care. It took 21 years for her acquittal to become final. In 2014, banker Takashi Hatta, slightly famous for being the first person in history to be acquitted in a tax prosecution case, launched a civil damage suit against the prosecutors for filing an abusive appeal. Needless to say, he lost.

To that end, the Dodgers can’t be alone in their zeal for Mookie Betts. That’s why we can’t discount the possibility that signing Nelson gives Friedman some leeway in his chats with Bloom. Does having Nelson allow Friedman to trade one of his other starting pitchers to Boston? Is David Price the left-handed starter the Dodgers were targeting to replace Hill and Ryu all along? Depending on how available Betts still is, I believe these are the more interesting questions today.

“The old manager had canceled most of the accounts previously established by Tony, the owner,” explained Julian, the new headman of all things wine. A certain lack of adherence to expected norms eventually lead to deficit spending. “A lot of money was going to waste,” Julian said. “Tony wanted to get back on track with the original thought process. The old manager was a good sommelier, but was pushing on some ideas that were a little too big for the space we have.”


  So there is was. A general divergence in methodologies between owner and manager eroded the books until something had to change. This is real world stuff — the type of things that often occur behind the scenes and unbeknownst to patrons. And then one day, your favorite establishment is gone.


  Thankfully, the Secret Wine Bar merely blipped, but didn’t disappear. But what now is the outlook going forward?


  “The original idea is still going to be the same,” beamed Julian. “We do plan on changing the menu a bit. We just recently added some new arrivals. But we’ll be bring back most of the original accounts, and training more heavily on cocktails — focusing mainly on absinthe, Tony’s favorite drink.” We never say no to absinthe, but we’re here for the wine.


  Julian’s vino recommendation? “My favorite is this Les Abeilles Cote de Rhone.” For approximately $7, this French GSM proves a fantastic deal. Also of note is the Embruix de Vall-Llach of the Priorate region — simply outstanding and an excellent example of what Priorate can produce.

LAKE CHARLES, La. (KPLC) - A cold start to our Wednesday morning as temperatures have dropped into the lower and upper 30′s across the area. Patches of frost are possible for the areas to the north as they have seen cooler temperatures as well as have been the coolest for the longest period of time. However, the good news is that as we head into the afternoon sunshine will be abundant and will provide for a gorgeous afternoon. First thing is first, if you are heading out this morning make sure to grab a coat as it will be very chilly, but warmer temperatures are to come for the afternoon. You can begin to shed the coat as we head into the later morning hours and into the lunch time hours as temperatures warm up to near 60. Highs today will top out in the middle 60′s with easterly winds around 5-15 mph slowly switching towards the southeast as we head into the overnight hours. If you have the chance definitely go out and enjoy the nice weather, because gloomy weather is around the corner as rain and thunderstorms are in the forecast for the end of the work week. As we go into tonight we cam expect temperatures to gradually drop, but we will be around 15-20 degrees warmer this evening as winds stay up overnight and moisture begins to return. Lows will bottom out in the lower to middle 50′s which is around ten degrees above average for this time of year. Jacket needed early, but sunshine makes for a nice afternoonAs we move into Thursday cloud cover will begin to increase as well as the chance of some showers as we head into the later afternoon hours, mainly after lunch time. Highs will also be getting warmer as we see highs topping off in the lower 70′s thanks to moisture increasing as we see stronger southerly flow. You’ll want to grab the rain jacket and umbrella as you head out for work or school as those rain chances gradually increase throughout the day, the good news being that the day won’t be as complete washout as rain totals look to be fairly light, as the heavier rain doesn’t move in until later Friday and into Saturday. As we go into Thursday evening off and on showers will persist across Southwest Louisiana with a rumble of thunder not out of the question. Lows will continue to be warm as we only drop into the lower 60′s by the time we reach Friday morning. Shower chances increase as a warm front lifts through the region for Thursday Friday we will continue to see warm temperatures, which on average will be around ten degrees above average as we see upper 70′s for highs, but the bigger story will be the rain and thunderstorms that we could see as an approaching cold front begins to make its way through the area. The heavier and more widespread looks to hold off until the afternoon and evening hours according to the latest model guidance and we will have to continue to watch this as we get closer in time. Moving into Friday evening and the overnight hours into Saturday, the threat of severe weather still remains and all modes of severe weather, from damaging winds, spin-up tornadoes and heavy rain. This is still several days out and the exact timing is still uncertain, but the first alert storm team will continue to track the system and have all the latest information and provide the details as we get closer. Severe weather threat still remains for Friday night into SaturdayStorms and heavy rain continue into Saturday morning some could be strong, so definitely stay tuned to the KPLC weather app for the latest updates and live look at radar as get closer as well as the latest updates we provide. The one positive being that as we head into the later afternoon and evening hours of Saturday we will see clearing and even some sunshine. The drier weather stay for Sunday, before rain chances once again increase into next week. Some models are hinting at a significant cool down after next weeks front, so as we get closer in time we will get a better handle on just how cold we could get. As for now stay tuned as we move into the late stages of this week and we get a better handle on the potential for severe weather.Meteorologist Jacob DurhamCopyright 2020 KPLC. All rights reserved.

Gov. Laura Kelly recommended Monday the state government pay off nearly $500 million in debt owed the Kansas Public Employees Retirement System and refinance the pension system's unfunded long-term liability to free up state tax dollars for other purposes.


  The Democratic governor said she would urge House and Senate members convening next week in Topeka to consider a package that included the debt and refinancing pieces.


  The GOP-led Legislature adopted a 20-year payment plan for debt repayment and had expressed limited support for reamortizing long-term pension liabilities.


  Kelly said in a statement the 2020 Legislature ought to promptly resolve a $477 million obligation to KPERS that under current law wouldn't be eradicated for two decades. Making a bulk payment to KPERS would save the state treasury about $200 million in interest payments.


  "We must act decisively to meaningfully reduce state debt, rebuild the state savings account and protect Kansas' ability to pay its bills in the long term," she said.


  Kelly said steps reducing the state's short-term annual payment to KPERS would be "sound, fiscally prudent tool often used in other states."      "I've always said that no political party holds the monopoly on good ideas," Kelly said. "Key elements of my plan were initially offered by Republican leaders in the past, and after reviewing carefully, I concluded that their idea merits consideration."


  If the refinancing proposal were enacted, the governor said, all retiree benefits would be safe despite extension of the time necessary to allocate sufficient money to cover liabilities far into the future.


  It would free up a projected $220 million in each of the next 15 years for appropriation to other areas of state government. However, the maneuver would cost the state billions of dollars to meet the unfunded liability in KPERS over a 25-year period rather than the current estimate of 15 years.


  "It costs $4.4 billion more for those 10 extra years," said Alan Conroy, executive director of KPERS.


  He said Kelly's proposal on refinancing wouldn't apply to the judges, police and fire or the local government sectors of KPERS.

KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) — An Afghan military helicopter crashed on Wednesday in the country's western Farah province, killing the two pilots on board, a defense ministry official said. The Mi-35 chopper crashed around 11 a.m. in the district of Pur Chaman, said Rohullah Ahmadzai, the ministry's spokesman. The helicopter was en route from the provincial capital, the city of Farah, to the district headquarters when it went down, he said, adding that a technical problem cause the crash. An investigation was underway. In November, two U.S. service members were killed when their helicopter crashed in eastern Logar province. The U.S. military at the time said preliminary reports did not indicate it was caused by enemy fire, though the Taliban claimed to have shot down the helicopter — a claim the U.S military dismissed as false. The month before, at least seven Afghan army personnel and crew died when their helicopter crashed in northern Balkh province. The cause of the crash at the time was said to be a technical problem. The Taliban now control or hold sway over practically half of Afghanistan but continue to stage near- daily attacks targeting Afghan and U.S. forces, as well as government officials — even as they hold peace talks with a U.S. envoy tasked with negotiating an end to what has become America's longest war. Scores of Afghan civilians are also killed in the crossfire or by roadside bombs planted by militants.

When most people think of the Adirondack Bank Center, they think of the Utica Comets.


   


  While the American Hockey League team is the headlining act, the arena is anything but empty when they're not in town. Most days, the first skaters hit the ice at 6:30 a.m. and a steady stream of teams use the facility until it closes at 11 p.m., said Ray Meyers, Adirondack Bank Center assistant general manager.


   


  The arena is shared by the Comets, two Utica College ice hockey teams, a National Collegiate Development Conference team and 13 youth hockey teams, as well as the Utica City FC soccer team. It's a lot of activity to be contained within a single facility and Meyers said scheduling is a big challenge.


   


  The Adirondack Bank Center has about 470 total employees, counting part-time and restaurant staff. There are only 15 maintenance staff employees, however, and ensuring proper staffing and time off between shifts can be tough, Meyers said.


   


  "A lot of what we do is a team effort; there's not one particular individual job," Meyers said. "It's a collaborative effort to get it done."


   


  The responsibilities for maintenance staff are varied and around the clock. Any given day, they're responsible for 11 ice cuts during hours of operation.


   


  Donald Bienkowski, the maintenance manager and an employee at the center for 19 years, watches the Comets practice while alongside the ice cutting machine he drives. He said he measures the thickness of the ice every Monday and weighs factors that can affect ice quality, including outside air temperature.


   


  While he hasn't cut ice during a Comets game this season, Bienkowski said he works during the day shift, when there's a team on the ice almost all the time.


   


  "You see a lot of hockey, that's for sure," Bienkowski said.


   


  Despite the demands of the job, Bienkowski said there are good workers at the Adirondack Bank Center and the work is fun.


   


  "It's exciting to work here," he said. "The people are great."


   


  The entire maintenance staff faces their biggest challenge when changing the arena surface from ice to something else, such as the turf field for Utica City FC. It's an all-night process, Bienkowski said.


   


  For soccer games, the ice needs to be covered by the turf and a lower tier of seating is pushed back to make a field-level beer garden. All of the glass is removed and some of the boards, to allow for recessed goals and team-specific advertising sponsors.


   


  Meyers said the changeover occurs at night, with maintenance employees working until 7 a.m., then returning by 4 p.m. the next day to do it again.


   


  The addition of the Adirondack Bank Center's new neighbor, the Nexus Center, won't alleviate the late-night changeovers between soccer and hockey, Meyers said. The 170,000-square-foot proposed facility will change some of the dynamics of use at the Aud, though.


   


  The Nexus Center, which may receive up to $22 million in state funds, is expected to have three sheets of ice. Meyers said the center's location along the Thruway will help draw tournaments.


   


  "Facilities like this exist in Marlborough, Massachusetts, Lake Placid, Buffalo, Philadelphia," said Lindsay Mogle, vice president of communications for the Utica Comets. "So if you look at those on a map, we're the central hub to all of that."


   


  With more ice availability once the Nexus Center is built, youth hockey is likely to grow, Meyers said. There currently are youth locker rooms and other amenities in the Adirondack Bank Center, but only one place to play.


   


  Youth hockey won't be the only beneficiary of the Nexus Center, however. If the Comets are displaced due to a concert or other event, as happened once with a police funeral, they have to find another place to practice, Meyers said.


   


  "Now they'll be able to practice on a different sheet of ice right here and won't have to travel to New Hartford or Whitesboro to get ice," he said.


   


  One current tenant of the Adirondack Bank Center, the Utica College women's ice hockey team, is still waiting to see the full impact of the Nexus Center. Coach Dave Clausen said it's unknown how scheduling will unfold with the new center, but everyone will benefit from the additional ice slots.


   


  "An expansion of facilities is going to be exciting," Clausen said.


   


  The additional ice will benefit those using the facility, but it will also impact existing maintenance employees.


   


  "It is going to be a lot more demand on our staff, having to maintain three more sheets of ice on top of the one we're doing now," Meyers said. "So our drivers will basically be going from one rink to another rink to the next rink all day long."


   


  The proposed Nexus Center follows the revitalization of the Adirondack Bank Center, which was expanded, renovated and rebranded in 2017. The facility received a 26,000-square-foot expansion, including a new entrance, executive suites and a new women's bathroom as part of a state-funded $10.55 million project.


   


  The Utica Memorial Auditorium was built by the City of Utica in 1959 on land donated by the state. The cable-supported roof structure was the first of its kind and the building provided inspiration for Madison Square Garden, the home of the New York Knicks and New York Rangers.

The Panthers scored eight of the game’s first 11 points and held leads of 12-6 and 21-13 before the Eagles closed the half with a 24-14 surge to build their two-point edge at intermission.


  Bridgewater converted 54.7 percent (29 of 53) of its shots from the field.


  Eighteen of those 29 field goals were produced by an assist, while half of Ferrum’s 32 field goals were created by an assist.


  Ferrum won the rebounding battle, 43-31, and the Panthers held edges in second-chance points (21-10), points in the paint (46-30) and bench points (37-24) at game’s end.


  The Eagles committed 14 turnovers as opposed to nine for the Panthers, but the Eagles were able to score 15 points off Ferrum miscues, while the Panthers netted 12 points off Bridgewater errors.


  Davriom Grier led Bridgewater with 25 points and Bowser came of the bench to net 22.


  Also, Chandler Murray finished with 18 points, seven rebounds and eight assists, Monte Simpkins tallied 11 and Liam Caswell scored 10.


  Plair tallied 12 points on a 6 of 8 shooting display and he pulled down a game-best nine rebounds.


  Also scoring for the Panthers were Brandon Reeves with eight points, Kajuan Madden-McAfee with seven, Nick Helton with five, Kalip Jones with three and Jamal Scott with two.

The company says the LiquorBot code was expanded with a module that attempted to mine the Monero (XMR) cryptocurrency on infected devices.


  The module, in itself, is quite useless, seeing that the entire botnet is predicated on infected routers, above anything else.


  SOHO (Small Office Home Office) routers are cheap devices that lack the CPU and hardware capabilities to adequately mine cryptocurrency -- which is a very resource-heavy operation.


  In the past, other IoT botnets have also wasted their time attempting to mine cryptocurrency on SOHO routers, with little success, and with all dropping any attempts within weeks, primarily due to the low yield the hacked devices were turning in.


  The first IoT botnet to experiment with the feature was a Mirai-based botnet operated out of China, back in March 2017. The botnet experiment with a Bitcoin-mining module for a week, before dropping the module altogether.


  The second was an IoT malware strain named Linux.MulDrop.14, detected by Dr.Web in June 2017. This botnet targeted Raspberry Pi devices, where it also attempted to mine Bitcoin. While Raspberry Pi devices have access to more hardware resources than your casual SOHO router, this botnet didn't break the bank either, stopping its experiments after a few weeks.


  The discovery of these two botnets in 2017 encouraged researchers to look into the possibility of IoT botnets of being used as cryptocurrency mining farms. At the time, Errata Security estimated that if a Mirai botnet of 2.5 million bots mined cryptocurrency it would earn only a meager $0.25 per day, effectively dispelling the notion that IoT botnets could ever be used for cryptocurrency mining.


  Apparently, the LiquorBot author didn't get the notice.

Arsenal reported being keen on signing Adrien Rabiot but Everton determined to land the midfielder.


  Adrien Rabiot is, without doubt, a very talented individual and English Premier League clubs are lining up to entice him away from Juventus claims Corriere dello Sport. per Sports Witness.


  The indication is that Everton is the front runners for the signature of the 24-year-old who is struggling for game time in Turin.


  Apparently, the reports in Italy state that both Tottenham and Arsenal have taken concrete steps to sign Rabiot but it is Everton that is the most eager.


  The Toffees are said to be ready to offer a £5 Million loan fee, cover his salary with an option to make the loan a permanent transfer in the summer.


  If that is accurate then you have to think that both Arsenal and Tottenham would be tempted to offer the same sort of deal.


  One massive obstacle that all three teams have, however, is that they will be unlikely to offer him Champions League football next season. It is not out of the question but the signs are that none of them will qualify for next seasons elite European competition.


  It would take a huge leap of faith from Rabiot to sign for a club, any club, that cannot offer a guarantee of European football next season but Juve basically can.


  There is serious midfield competition at the Italian champions but the Frenchman may feel he has more chance of playing in the Champions League fighting for a first-team spot with the old lady rather than signing for a club that can offer only aspiration.


  But if he is tempted to sign for a Premier League club you have to hope that Arsenal does not sit idly by and allow Everton or Tottenham a free run at him.

“He was always thinking 10 to 15 years down the road,” Ayoub said. “He had a really unique quality of leadership. He was a great leader and it was one of the things that drew me to his story — he not only knew the details, but he had the vision.”
 Ayoub said the Gottschalk story is a Nebraska story of how someone can rise from small-town origins to become a state leader and a voice for Nebraska.
 He said Gottschalk’s values came from the hard work, loyalty and honesty he gathered from living and growing up in Nebraska’s Sandhills country.
 And, Ayoub said, Gottschalk’s legacy goes beyond just being publisher of the state’s biggest newspaper. He said Gottschalk was “really big on duty.” Along with his newspaper responsibilities, he served as national president of the Boy Scouts of America during a turbulent time for the organization, along with other national organizations.
 He said under Gottschalk’s reign at the World-Herald, the paper reached a zenith in Sunday circulation with more than 300,000 subscribers. The World- Herald was the nation’s 52nd largest daily newspaper at the time.

The sky is an endless unfading blue as I write this, just a wisp or two of clouds to remind me that nothing is perfect.
 This moment is close enough, however.
 Folk/Christian artist Carrie Newcomer is telling me softly through my computer’s speakers that there is a meeting of the minds and a place at the table for me to sit, and I take her word for the truth of that. All my favorite things surround me and every so often a pup pops his nose into the office just to check me out.
 As I said, all of it is darn near as good as it can be.
 By the time you read this, it could all be different. But it helps for us to remember the beautiful doesn’t actually go away. It is merely hidden for a little while.
 Perhaps I should say it would be good if we remembered that, which we rarely seem to do. More typically, those old clouds roll in and we’re certain that doom awaits us.
 Quick, think back. When was the very first time you heard people talking about the end being near? When did someone first tell you the signs were all there for either the end of the world or the end of the United States?
 How long have those dang communists been working on that list of 10 things they are doing to take over America? I know that old canard has been hanging around for at least 50 years. When I first saw it, the list was attributed to Lenin. Now it’s George Soros or someone who was close to former President Barack Obama.
 We don’t have to worry about commies. Our government has enough difficulty getting anything done as it is and I’m convinced communism is the least efficient form of government.
 Rumors of the imminent imposition of Sharia Law are beginning to get a little long in the tooth, too.
 If you listen to such nonsense you might think that, say, Nacogdoches has fallen sway to Islamic control, with a madras being established on the town square. That’s not true, just an illustration of some of the more nonsensical rumors of our demise you might hear.
 (I will no doubt get a letter from the Nacogdoches Chamber of Commerce about this tall tale, which, in about two weeks, will be believed by someone out there.)
 Even with zero proof, some people believe anything — just as long as it is the worst possible outcome imaginable. They forget the sun was just shining bright as could be. Making up disasters is more fun for some than believing the boring truth, though.
 Mind you, I have a great dislike for any nation going out and wantonly killing Americans, especially if those people are killed just because they were born here.
 But I don’t feel much better about the United States killing people from other nations, especially when the evidence — and strategic reasoning — for doing so is weak. It always seems to be weak.
 The sun may not be in the Seventh House or Jupiter aligned with Mars, but I’m pretty sure Ol’ Sol is still shining down upon us, no matter what fearmongers say. That’s the lesson we should not forget.

  The airline had also undergone scheduled maintenance just two days before the crash on Wednesday, which killed 167 passengers and nine crew.


  Most of the passengers were making connecting flights via Kiev's Boryspil airport, the main hub of UIA. There were citizens of Iran, Canada, Germany, the UK, Sweden and Afghanistan among the victims.


  UIA's 737-800, which belongs to the troubled family of Boeing's single-aisle, medium-haul jets, was less than four years old, according to Flightradar. Nevertheless, it was extensively used by the airline, completing up to four flights a day.


  Founded in 1992 as the country's flag carrier, UIA connects Ukraine with 38 countries in Europe, Asia, Africa and the Americas. Although the airline describes itself as a _" low-fare network carrier,"_ it hadn't lost single plane in accidents or incidents in recent decades.

TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- A stampede erupted on Tuesday at a funeral procession for a top Iranian general killed in a U.S. airstrike last week, killing 32 people and injuring 190 others, Iran's state television reported.   According to the report, the stampede took place in Kerman, the hometown of Revolutionary Guard Gen. Qassem Soleimani, as the procession got underway. There was no information as to what had set it off. Initial videos posted online showed people lying lifeless on a road and others shouting and trying to help them. His funeral was later delayed but no new timing was given.   Iranian state TV gave the casualty toll in its online report, citing Pirhossein Koulivand, the head of Iran's emergency medical services.   "Unfortunately as a result of the stampede, some of our compatriots have been injured and some have been killed during the funeral processions," he earlier said. In delaying Soleimani's burial, authorities cited concerns about the massive crowd that had gathered, the semi-official ISNA news agency said.   A procession in Tehran on Monday drew over 1 million people in the Iranian capital, crowding both main thoroughfares and side streets in Tehran.   Soleimani's death has sparked calls across Iran for revenge against America for a slaying that's drastically raised tensions across the Middle East. The U.S. government warned ships of an unspecified threat from Iran across all the Mideast's waterways, crucial routes for global energy supplies. Meanwhile, the U.S. Air Force launched a drill with 52 fighter jets in Utah, just days after President Donald Trump threatened to hit 52 sites in Iran.   Early Tuesday, the leader of Iran's Revolutionary Guard threatened to "set ablaze" places supported by the United States over the killing of a top Iranian general in a U.S. airstrike last week, sparking cries from the crowd of supporters of "Death to Israel!" Hossein Salami made the pledge before a crowd of thousands gathered in a central square in Kerman before a casket carrying Soleimani's remains.   The outpouring of grief was an unprecedented honor for a man viewed by Iranians as a national hero for his work leading the Guard's expeditionary Quds Force. The U.S. blames him for the killing of American troops in Iraq and accused him of plotting new attacks just before his death Friday in a drone strike near Baghdad's airport. Soleimani also led forces in Syria backing President Bashar Assad in a long war, and he also served as the point man for Iranian proxies in countries like Iraq, Lebanon and Yemen.   His slaying already has pushed Tehran to abandon the remaining limits of its 2015 nuclear deal with world powers as his successor and others vow to take revenge. In Baghdad, the parliament has called for the expulsion of all American troops from Iraqi soil, something analysts fear could allow Islamic State militants to mount a comeback.   Speaking in Kerman, Salami praised Soleimani's exploits, describing him as essential to backing Palestinian groups, Yemen's Houthi rebels and Shiite militias in Iraq and Syria. As a martyr, Soleimani represented an even greater threat to Iran's enemies, Salami said.   "We will take revenge. We will set ablaze where they like," Salami said, drawing the cries of "Death to Israel!"   Israel is a longtime regional foe of Iran.   According to a report on Tuesday by the semi-official Tasnim news agency, Iran has worked up 13 sets of plans for revenge for Soleimani's killing. The report quoted Ali Shamkhani, the secretary of Iran's Supreme National Security Council, as saying that even the weakest among them would be a "historic nightmare" for the U.S. He declined to give any details,   "If the U.S. troops do not leave our region voluntarily and upright, we will do something to carry their bodies horizontally out," Shamkhani said.   The U.S. Maritime Administration warned Tuesday ships across the Mideast, citing the rising threats after the U.S. killed Soleimani. "The Iranian response to this action, if any, is unknown, but there remains the possibility of Iranian action against U.S. maritime interests in the region," it said.   Oil tankers were targeted in mine attacks last year the U.S. blamed on Iran. Tehran denied being responsible though it did seize oil tankers around the crucial Strait of Hormuz, the narrow mouth of the Persian Gulf through which 20% of the world's crude oil travels.   The U.S. Navy's Bahrain-based 5th Fleet said it would work with shippers in the region to minimize any possible threat.   The 5th Fleet "has and will continue to provide advice to merchant shipping as appropriate regarding recommended security precautions in light of the heightened tensions and threats in the region," 5th Fleet spokesman Cmdr. Joshua Frey told The Associated Press.   Meanwhile, Iranian Gen. Alireza Tabgsiri, the chief of the Guard's navy, issued his own warning.   "Our message to the enemies is to leave the region," Tabgsiri said, according to ISNA. The Guard routinely has tense encounters with the U.S. Navy in the Persian Gulf.   Iran's parliament, meanwhile, has passed an urgent bill declaring the U.S. military's command at the Pentagon and those acting on its behalf in Soleimani's killing as "terrorists," subject to Iranian sanctions. The measure appears to be an attempt to mirror a decision by Trump in April to declare the Revolutionary Guard a "terrorist organization."   The U.S. Defense Department used the Guard's designation as a terror organization in the U.S. to support the strike that killed Soleimani. The decision by Iran's parliament, done by a special procedure to speed the bill to law, comes as officials across the country threaten to retaliate for Soleimani's killing.   The vote also saw lawmakers approve funding for the Quds Force with an additional 200 million euros, or about $224 million.   Also Tuesday, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said the U.S. had declined to issue him a visa to travel to New York for upcoming meetings at the United Nations. The U.S. as the host of the U.N. headquarters is supposed to allow foreign officials to attend such meetings.   "This is because they fear someone will go there and tell the truth to the American people," Zarif said. "But they are mistaken. The world is not limited to New York. You can speak with American people from Tehran too and we will do that."   The U.S. State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.   Solemani will ultimately be laid to rest between the graves of Enayatollah Talebizadeh and Mohammad Hossein Yousef Elahi, two former Guard comrades. The two died in Operation Dawn 8 in Iran's 1980s war with Iraq in which Soleimani also took part, a 1986 amphibious assault that cut Iraq off from the Persian Gulf and led to the end of the bloody war that killed 1 million people.   ___   Gambrell reported from Dubai, United Arab Emirates.

Scott made the comments in an interview with The Canadian Press as an independent expert panel is set to release a comprehensive report this month detailing the changes that are need to bring the Broadcast Act and Telecommunications Act into the new century.
 Until about a year ago, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his then-minister of heritage were dismissing the notion of taxing international streaming companies.
 But during the fall election campaign, Trudeau was joined by all the major opposition leaders in agreeing that international tech giants need to contribute to Canada's economy.
 "Companies who are extracting a profit, they are participating in the Canadian market and deriving revenues, should be contributing," Scott said while being interviewed in his CRTC office in Gatineau, Que.
 "That includes Netflix and all of the others in that situation," he said.
 "The manner that they contribute is what's at issue."
 Companies such as Bell Media and other so-called traditional broadcasters are required to pay into the Canadian Media Fund to help finance production of Canadian content.
 Netflix has argued it should not have to pay into such a fund because it can't draw on it. Instead, it has committed — without being required to do so under current regulations — to spending on the production of movies and other content in Canada.
 The U.S.-based company has pledged to spend at least half a billion dollars over five years to fund original Canadian productions.
 As a result, Netflix is "probably the single largest contributor to the (Canadian) production sector today," said Scott.
 "They are filling up production facilities across the country," he said. "So is Amazon, so is Disney."
 European countries have enacted legislation to force streaming services to pay for original domestic content. In France, Netflix pays a set tax on its revenue from French subscriptions.
 In the case of YouTube, which provides content produced by its users, a tax is applied to its ad revenue.

Phil is doing the right thing. Nothing wrong with coal exports from Oakland. Millions of tons move through the ports of Richmond, Stockton, and let's not forget Long Beach. All export the same source of coal. So why not Oakland? It will not harm the residents and it will create some local jobs. Phil's facility will be the state of the art. Cleaner than all the others. This coal will move for years to Asia and why be so naive to give it to other ports. Even Vancouver, Canada will take this coal, and that's not environmentally smart as much longer rail haul. Why don't the powers to be study the facts instead of just thinking about keeping their political seat?

Both the phones pack sizeable 4,500mAh batteries and support 25W fast charging - there's no wireless charging though. The Galaxy S10 Lite is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 processor and the Galaxy Note 10 Lite has Samsung's S-Pen. Samsung is also touting cameras, especially on the Galaxy S10 Lite that comes with something called 'super steady OIS' for seemingly more stabilized videos.
