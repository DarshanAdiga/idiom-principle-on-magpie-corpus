Many women are willing to go under the knife to get bigger breasts. But, there are risks associated with breast implant surgery which includes breast implant rupture, visible lumps or rippling in the breasts, complications arising due to anaesthesia, infections, haematoma and haemorrhage, medical complications such as thyroid problems or fibromyalgia. This seems quite risky, right? So, why not go the natural way to increase your breast size by eating foods high in oestrogen?Foods like sesame seeds, flax seeds, soya beans etc., are rich in phytoestrogen (plant-based oestrogen), which will help stimulate your oestrogen level to the maximum thus helping in breast growth. A regular consumption of these healthy oestrogen foods will give you good results in no time. The other good thing about these oestrogen foods is the vitamins they contain. These powerful vitamins not only help with breast development but improve your breast health too.How Does Oestrogen Help Breast Growth? nbsp;Eating oestrogen rich foods is the best way to increase your breast size. Oestrogen is the female hormone which is responsible for making your body curvy and your breasts look bigger. During puberty, the hormone oestrogen is needed in greater amounts to transform the body of a girl into a woman. This hormone triggers your menstrual cycle which makes your body curvier and increases your breast growth.From the age of 12 to 16, a womans body has a high amount of oestrogen and this is the time when the body undergoes various changes. However, when puberty stops, the levels of oestrogen in the body is reduced leaving your breasts to remain in the same size throughout your life.So, in order to make your breasts look bigger even after puberty you just have to eat oestrogen rich foods. Soy milk is an excellent source of isoflavones that imitate the female hormone oestrogen which increases the growth of breast tissue. Soy milk is made from soybeans which can also be consumed for increasing breast growth. In addition, the intake of soy products is associated with reduced breast cancer risk, according to a study 1. Drink a glass of soy milk every morning and add soybeans in your salads or boil them and have them in the morning. Traditionally, herbalists have used fennel seeds to improve the health of the breast in lactating mothers. The seeds of the fennel plant are rich in phytoestrogens which are important for breast augmentation. Fennel seeds are also known to contain natural plant hormones, flavonoids and different aromatic molecules like estragole, anethole and fenshon which help in developing breast tissues and increase milk secretion 2. Milk and other dairy products contain similar reproductive hormones as found in our body. For instance, cow milk is known to contain all the hormones like oestrogen, prolactin and progesterone which are important for milk production. As milk contains oestrogen, it can also help in the growth of breasts. Boil a glass of milk and drink it in the morning and at night. Everyone knows that beetroots are rich in iron, but apart from that both beetroots and beet greens have a good amount of oestrogen and contain boron, which helps in the synthesis of oestrogen in the body. This supplements your body with oestrogen, thus promoting breast growth naturally. Carrots are known for their beta-carotene content, antioxidant, and other vital minerals and vitamins. The orange- coloured vegetable is another way to help increase your breast growth naturally because it contains oestrogen precursors. Carrots also contain unique indigestible fibres that help in removing excess oestrogen from the body as high oestrogen levels could lead to swelling and tenderness in the breast, fibrocystic lumps in the breasts 3. Nuts with high oestrogen or phytoestrogen content include pistachios, walnuts, cashews, peanuts and pecans. Pistachios are ranked on top of the phytoestrogen content list. Almonds, cashews and walnuts are also a very good source of phytoestrogens that will give you the extra dose of oestrogen in the body 4, 5. Papaya is another fruit rich in oestrogen. In fact, drinking papaya juice with milk is considered a good natural remedy to increase your breast size naturally. However, ensure that you dont drink it in excess as it may cause diarrhoea. Pregnant women shouldnt consider drinking this concoction as well. If you are lactose intolerant, consume slices of papaya after a meal. Fenugreek seeds are another food that is rich in phytoestrogen which promotes better mammary gland growth. We have always thought that these seeds are only good for weight loss and enhance hair growth. The phytoestrogens and diosgenin present in fenugreek seeds encourage prolactin hormone which is associated with breast growth 6. You can either have one tsp fenugreek seeds daily or apply herbal fenugreek oil on your breasts and massage it. Seeds with high oestrogen content include flaxseeds, sesame seeds, sunflower seeds, and pumpkin seeds. All of these are considered good for the growth and development of the breasts. Flaxseeds are a natural breast enhancement food which increases breast tissue growth and make them look larger. Sesame, pumpkin, and sunflower seeds also have the potential to boost oestrogen levels in the body, thus promoting the growth of breasts. Eating seafood like prawns, oysters, and shellfish can induce growth of breasts. Do you know how? These seafood contain good amounts of manganese that triggers sex hormones in the body and as a result the breast size increases. Include these foods in your daily diet and see the results for yourself! Fruits like bananas, cherries, pomegranates, apples, watermelon etc., can help increase breast size naturally. Because it helps boost the production of oestrogen in the body and lowers the amount of testosterone to give you firm and fuller looking breasts. Also, these fruits contain plenty of vitamins and minerals which will further improve the health of your breast. Olive oil is rich in antioxidants like vitamin E that helps in protecting the body from free radical damage. Massaging olive oil on the breast keeps the skin of your breasts moisturised and firm that helps with the overall appearance of your bust. Choose a high-quality olive oil and apply a few drops on the breast and massage it with your hands in circular motion. Alfalfa sprouts are also known for increasing breast size due to the presence of a phytoestrogen compound called isoflavone which stimulates the growth of breasts and breast milk. In addition, alfalfa sprouts are prized for their vitamins and minerals used for treating kidney, bladder and prostate conditions. You can eat alfalfa sprouts by adding them in your salads or your sandwiches. Pueraria mirifica is one of the most effective herbs used for breast enlargement 7. This herb has the highest concentration of phytoestrogen than any other herb. Thats the reason pueraria mirifica herb is considered one of the potential herbs to stimulate breast growth. However, there are side effects associated with the herb like nausea, headache, dizziness, etc. Red clover is a blooming plant used as an alternative medicine for coughs, disorders of the lymphatic system and some cancers. It contains nutrients like calcium, niacin, phosphorous, thiamine, magnesium, potassium and vitamin C. Red clover also helps in breast enlargement due to the phytoestrogen it has. Some phytoestrogens in red clover have genistein that binds to estradiol receptors which are responsible for breast growth. The plant extract is used in many ways ranging from using it for breast massaging to having it as a capsule and tea. Many herbalists recommend wild yam for breast growth because it contains diosgenin, a phytoestrogen that helps in enlarging your breasts. In a study conducted, 24 healthy post-menopausal women were given 390 g of yam for 30 days. The result of the study was an increase in serum concentration of estrone (26%), sex hormone binding globulin (9.5 %), and an increase in estradiol (27 %) 8. The dong quai root is mainly used as a medication for women for their menstrual and menopausal health. It makes your breasts bigger due to the presence of a chemical called isoflavone which is broken down by the body into oestrogen, which is the main hormone responsible for breast growth. In addition, the root soothes your breast tissues as well.So, in case, you are looking for methods to increase your breast size naturally, consuming these foods can help.

Their ranch home is modern on the outside, but filled with antiques from family, friends and things they have picked up over the years.
 “I love the old things and try to imagine the stories these little things may have been part of,” Michelini said.
 One of the things that resonates with them about antiques is the modern applications. Bahr and Michelini were both raised to take care of what they had. Repurposing items and repairing belongings falls in line with being environmentally conscious. The quality of most antiques seems to surpass that of newer items made to be less expensive and have a faster production rate. The antique business is green.
 One additional benefit of being in the business is, they can select items to enjoy for a time and then send them on for someone else to love. They also have an eye for items that suit their clients personal styles. One woman came in and looked at an item for months, they knew it was perfect for her. She now has a unique headboard that is the centerpiece of the room and a great conversation piece.
 Go visit Wagon Wheel Antiques and see what treasures you can uncover. The store is open seven days a week from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Saturday and 1 p.m. to 5 p.m. Sunday. It is easily accessible at 7150 S. Highway 31 E., Murchison. Visit its website at www.wagonwheelantiquemall.com or call at 903-469-4321.

If that's the case, a lot of teams will become negative - if they fall even slightly behind in a match, they'll go straight for the draw. The results ratio is already pretty low, that will worsen and people's interest in Tests will dip. They want results. In a five-day match, even if there's rain in the middle, there's still enough time to try and force a result, Misbah was quoted as saying on ESPNcricinfo website.

In Europe, we face a “no-deal” Brexit. Germany’s SPD has named new party leaders who have pledged to seek a better deal with Chancellor Merkel for their constituency, thus putting its governing coalition with Merkel’s majority CDU/CSU at risk and raising the prospect there could be snap elections in the early part of 2020 if no governing coalition is maintained. (The rightmost AfD party has also elected a more radically right leadership.) And in France, strikes continue over Emmanuel Macron’s plans to reform generous government pension plans.
 Our concerns about the rollover of dollar, euro, and pound denominated debt China owes American, European, and British banks continues, although USD/CNY rates have improved.
 The yield curve inversions and rates narrowing that have troubled us for some time have receded somewhat since the Fed’s rate cut and spreads have improved but not yet sufficient.
 We continue to have overall concerns about US demographics, particularly the aging of the US population, an increase in the average age of marriage and family formation, student debt levels, and retirements from skilled trades that are not being filled by new entrants to those professions.
 We’re also wary of the simple length of the recovery. While recoveries don’t die of “old age”, there is still a business cycle that merits respect.
 All things considered, we are still at a “green light” outlook, but dependent on future data. The slowing US economy we identified back in our August jobs report continues, but we reiterate our sense that a recession (i.e., two consecutive quarters of negative growth) is unlikely through at least September, 2020. The closest possible start of a recession we foresee is 2020 Q3, but, again, that will depend on data. A “black swan” would obviously alter that view.
 The 2019 Q2 GDP originally printed at 2.1%, revised, the lower end of our predicted 1.9% to 2.4%. But, as we expected, that number printed lower on its final revision on September 26th, at the 2.0 percent we had predicted in our July jobs report. The 2019 Q3 GDP estimate printed at 2.1%, slightly exceeding our upper end of our range estimate of 1.5% to 2.0% and 50 bps above the consensus 1.6% estimate. Geopolitical and domestic political concerns continue to be troubling and we expect the GDP number to be volatile as circumstances change.

“Police face every day what we fear,” said DeKalb County Commission President Ricky Harcrow during a Thursday ceremony in honor of National Law Enforcement Appreciation Day.
 “I borrow this phrase from somebody else, but I think it is as true today as it ever was,” Harcrow said. “Law enforcement officers of every rank and file have chosen a profession that puts their lives on the line every day for our communities. They have answered a call for public service that is demanding and, oftentimes, very much unappreciated. From local and state to federal, their duties command dedication. They work long hours away from their families, and rarely do they know what they will face when they go to work. They do what they can, where they are, with what they have. And I want to acknowledge that today. I want to tell you gentlemen how much we appreciate you and offer our thanks for the service that you render.”
 He noted that particularly in smaller towns, “law enforcement is often the only paid emergency resource in a community. They often work in coordination with local, state and federal organizations to make communities safer. Now we have an opportunity to offer them appreciation. I want to thank the law enforcement team across our county and recognize each of them as a dedicated public servant.”

ATLANTA (AP) — Georgia lawmakers may remember the 2020 session as the year the good times ended. The state has seen nine years of strong revenue growth coming out of the great recession, with tax receipts climbing an average of nearly 6% each year. That has allowed lawmakers to cut taxes, increase teacher pay and education funding, and sock away more than $3 billion into the state's savings account. But tax receipts were down $33.6 million through November compared to the same five months of the 2019 budget year. That might not sound catastrophic for a government that is supposed to spend $53 billion this year once federal aid is factored in. But this year's budget projected that state revenue would increase by $800 million to $27.5 billion. The shortfall led Gov. Brian Kemp to order mid-year budget cuts of 4% for some agencies, and order them to prepare another 2% in cuts for the 2021 budget beginning July 1. “People who haven't been around a budget-cutting session are going to be in for a real surprise,\" said House Speaker David Ralston, a Blue Ridge Republican. Worse, with elections looming in November for all 236 seats in the General Assembly, lawmakers may not be able to honor some expensive promises as they convene Monday. “It's an issue that's going to consume the entire session,\" said House Minority Leader Bob Trammell, a Luthersville Democrat. First up is a proposal for a second cut in Georgia's top income tax rate. A cut from 6% to 5.75% began in 2019, and another cut to 5.5% was foreseen for this year. Then there's the teacher pay raise. The Republican Kemp muscled through a $3,000 pay raise for teachers last year, and promises another $2,000. Kemp says he won't seek money now to partly expand Medicaid health insurance coverage and subsidize some...

Ordnance Factory Board OFB is planning to introduce smart bombs and would soon roll out a Futuristic Infantry Combat Vehicle made for the Indian Army, a top official said here on Saturday. The first-ever conference of employees of 41 ordnance factories in the country is being held at the National Academy for Defence Production at Ambajhari near here. Director General Ordnance Factories and Chairman Ordnance Factories Board Hari Mohan told reporters that the conference would focus on themes important for the transformation of ordnance factories into modern and business-oriented organisations. Ordnance factories were also planning to manufacture smart bombs or guided artillery ammunition rounds of 81mm, 51mm, 120mm and 130mm caliber, he informed. A Futuristic Infantry Combat Vehicle for the Indian Army was also in the works, he added. OFB started manufacturing Armoured Personal Carriers for the army from 1983-84. But now the OFB has developed its own Futuristic Infantry Combat FIC Vehicle for the army, he said. It is almost 85 percent ready. In coming months the FIC will be fully ready and exhibited in the next Defence exhibition, Mohan added..

ATK are set to lock horns with Kerala Blasters in what should be an electric Hero Indian Super League ISL clash at the Vivekananda Yuba Bharati Krirangan here on Sunday. ATK, two-time champions, and Kerala Blasters, two-time runners-up, have some history between them in the ISL. On both occasions that ATK won the title, it was the side from Kochi that they vanquished in the final.However, Kerala are unbeaten in the last five matches against ATK and the home team will want to turn the tables this time, especially given that Kerala defeated them 2-1 in the reverse fixture in Kochi in the opening game of the season. In the opening game, they didnt know anything about us and we didnt know anything about them. This game I know exactly where their weaknesses are and how are they scoring. I have a good game plan. I have never lost against ATK. So, I hope to get another win, said Kerala Blasters coach Eelco Schattorie.ATK have been in brilliant form this season, with the in-form duo of Roy Krishna and David Williams powering their attack that has scored 21 goals in 11 matches -- second only to FC Goa. Krishna and Williams alone have contributed 13 goals.However, Williams participation in this game is doubtful, after he picked up an injury. We dont know whether Williams will play. We will decide before the match. But my idea of football is not dependent on individuals, said ATK coach Antonio Habas.Habas received telling contributions from their Indian players, with Pronay Halder and Michael Soosairaj scoring in their win over Mumbai City FC in the last match. The likes of Prabir Das and Sumit Rathi have also impressed. I understand perfectly the Indian players. We have good Indian players. For us it is easy. Pritam Kotal, Arindam Bhattacharya, Prabir are all good players. Sumit is a top player too. He has good ideas and is a good defender. Give him a couple of years more, he could be in the national team, said Habas.It is no surprise that they sit third on the table with 21 points and will go level with FC Goa at the top with a win. Kerala Blasters also have an in-form strike partnership in Raphael Messi Bouli and Bartholomew Ogbeche which has contributed 11 goals so far. But their defence has been plagued by injuries and inconsistencies that has seen them pick just two wins in 11 matches.The second of those wins came in the last match, a resounding 5-1 win in which both Messi and Ogbeche found the net. We are the only team with seven foreigners and out of them, six have been injured at some point in time. We have struggled with our defence. In the midfield also we have had to make constant changes. I have not been able to field the same XI in two successive games, said Schattorie.Now placed eighth on the table, they badly need a win to take them within 2 points of fourth-placed Mumbai City. Kerala will hope to repeat their feat from last season and boost their top-four hopes while ATK will look to continue their impressive form while exacting a measure of revenge.

The Madisonville Town Council took the next step toward relocation of all town offices to a building at 209 La. 22 when it authorized the expenditure of funds for the purchase of the building.
 The authorization came at the Jan. 8 council meeting.
 The partnership that owns the building offered it to the town last year for $650,000, which is $200,000 less than its appraised value. In November, the council authorized Mayor Jean Pelloat to explore the possibility of purchasing the building at the asking price.
 Based on a feasibility study byarchitect Alan Antoine, Pelloat decided that the building met the town’s needs and asked the council to authorize the expenditure.
 The building contains 6,545 square feet of air-conditioned office space, which is enough to house all town offices, including the police department.
 The site also includes a 1,716-square-foot covered porch, a 1,874-square-foot open deck and 21 off-street parking spots.
 Antoine estimates that renovations to the building will cost approximately $800,000 and take 14 months to complete. The renovation plan includes reconfiguration of the building’s office space, a 90-person council chamber, a center for smaller community meetings, and open space for public functions.
 When renovations are complete, town offices will relocate from the existing building at 403 St. Francis Street, which need repairs and is subject to flooding from the Tchefuncte River that flows in front of the property. The new building is raised above the ground and is two blocks west of the river, which significantly reduces the possibility of flooding and the cost of flood insurance.
 What will happen to the St. Francis Street site is up in the air. Possibilities include using the building as a community events center, or tearing it down and replacing it with an open-air performance stage flanked by a pair of open pavilions.
 In other action, the council authorized expenditure of $60,000 to purchase two lots adjacent to the town maintenance barn on Johnson Street. The purchase provides land for the future expansion of the town’s maintenance facilities.

A _Parasite_ remake has to bear in mind that Bong's film is a constantly shifting object with deep lurches between drama and comedy, often within the same scene. Go too far in one direction and you lose the vibe entirely. Other American directors may be too inclined to underline either the serious or comic elements. Fincher has always found a way to nestle them inside each other, making him perhaps the only person who could really do Bong's vision justice.

All India Football Federations AIFF developmental side Indian Arrows will host Tiddim Road Athletic Union TRAU FC at the Tilak Maidan in Goa on Sunday, January 12. The Arrows, after six games, find themselves rooted to the bottom of the I-League standings. However, the young Arrows have shown signs of incredible resilience, giving every team in the tournament a run for their money until the final whistle.Despite falling short against Mohun Bagan in their previous game, Shanmugam Venkatesh, head coach, Indian Arrows reflected on the positives. Mohun Bagan had a difficult time against us and it was not an easy outing at all. Our boys fought neck-to-neck until the final whistle and the experience will surely bear fruits for us in the upcoming matches, Venkatesh said in a statement.TRAU, in their last match, found the taste of victory and facing them now would be really challenging. They are improving constantly and we have to be at the top of our game to get some points, he added. TRAU, on the other hand, lifted themselves off the foot of the I-League standings following their historic and so far, maiden victory over cross-city rivals Neroca.Another stat to be taken into account is that the Tiddim Road outfit have been unbeaten for three games now, with their last defeat dating back to almost a month ago, when they lost to Kolkata giants Quess East Bengal on December 14 last year. Speaking ahead of the match, Dimitris Dimitriou, head coach, TRAU FC said, My boys all are pumped up and it was a great win for us against Neroca. Now we have to start fresh and from scratch. We are looking forward to the game against Indian Arrows match and like any other fixture, this one is very important to us.Buoyed by their recent form, and under new leadership at the helm, TRAU can move two places up to seventh in the standings, if they can come away with three points but against coach Venkateshs young Arrows, it will always be a hard-fought affair.

 Trump doubles down on threat to Iran cultural sites
 US President Donald Trump doubled down Sunday on a threat to attack Iranian cultural sites despite accusations that any such strike would amount to a war crime. After his top diplomat, Mike Pompeo, had insisted that any military action would conform to international law, Trump said he would regard cultural sites as fair game if Iran resorted to deadly force against US targets.

Bond says.
 She didn’t win. Bond pulled nearly 6% of the vote, ranking third out of four candidates. Victory instead went to now-U.S. Rep. Jared Golden, a Democrat who unseated the Republican incumbent in a second round of counting when no candidate initially received a majority. But ranked choice voting also led to Golden’s win in a largely rural district, allowing Golden to rack up enough second-choice votes to push him over the top, winning with 50.6% of the vote, even though incumbent Bruce Poliquin led in the first round of counting.
 Bond is running in 2020 in an effort to unseat longtime Republican U.S. Sen. Susan Collins. And she’ll do it knowing that she won’t be a “spoiler” to the Democratic candidate, but a sound choice for independent voters who are typically forced to compromise their values to vote for one of two major parties.

Let’s be very honest about this. We don’t like the fact that she was with Victor simply because she was already married to his other son once – and then again. She and Nick had a longtime relationship, and that’s a big problem for us. You don’t move on from your husband to his father when he’s already a married man and call it a day. It’s gross, and it’s beyond incestuous, and it’s not a thing we like to see and hear and be around in any capacity. She’s got some issues in her life that allow her to move through the long list of men in this family with ease.

This ratio is continuing to fall to the downside, and while this is quite a speculative trading indicator to use, the current bearish move would certainly strengthen our bearish thesis on the NZD/CAD pair going forward.
 In summary, owing to a possibly optimistic bond market with respect to short- term interest rates (for the NZD/CAD pair, specifically), combined with short favorable moves in the commodity space, and the fact that the NZD has probably over-shot to the upside (in light of the fact that the pair can be subject to active FX intervention from the RBNZ in such times...), we should continue to view the prospect of further NZD/CAD weakness as probable.
 This outlook we also take at a time shortly after the pair has met with resistance, as previously predicted, at the midpoint of its apparently prevailing medium-term trading range.

RUTLAND, Vt. (AP) — A Vermont city plans to expand and adapt a program that sought to address the opioid crisis and other social problems. In 2012, Rutland created Project Vision, which brought together churches, police, social workers, substance abuse experts, businesses and others to fight the drug problem as well as rising crime. The project organizers are now planning to update their objectives and goals, including expanding from a focus on the Northwest neighborhood, hardest hit by the opioid epidemic, to the whole city, the Rutland Herald reports. Project Vision founder Joe Kraus said he thinks the key to maintaining the project is to take an honest look at what has been accomplished and what remains to be done. “I underline the word ‘honest’ because while we have a lot of successes, there are areas where we have not been successful and we need to be honest about that so we can deal with our challenges and rise to the occasion,” Kraus said. Kraus said that he was “amazed” that after seven years, the organization's monthly meetings still fill a room. Project Vision is part of the series of efforts that has includes police actions, drug treatment programs, social services, businesses and — perhaps most of all — community determination to help and restore a sense of hope to a city that was ravaged by the opioid epidemic sweeping America. In the middle years of the last decade Rutland drew national attention for its heroin problem. The group is planning to survey everyone on the organization's email list looking for strengths and weaknesses. The ideas generated by those survey results will be discussed at the organization's meetings in the coming months. “The success of this turns completely on all of us,\" Kraus said. “Don’t look to somebody...

Union Petroleum and Natural Gas Minister Dharmendra Pradhan on Saturday said there is no need to panic about oil prices owing to present tensions between Iran and the US. The government has taken a position to wait and watch and there is no need to panic, he said on the sidelines of a CII event here. There are tensions in the Persian Gulf due to geo- political reasons, the Union minister said. There is no dearth of crude oil in the global market. Yes, there has been some spike in oil prices, but for the last two days it is subdued, Pradhan said. Crude oil prices rose to a three-month high of almost USD 72 a barrel soon after Iranian air strikes at US-Iraqi military bases, but cooled off amid speculation that Tehran is opting for limited retaliation over the killing of its top general. Iranian strikes followed the killing of General Qassem Soleimani last week on US President Donald Trumps orders. Tensions between the two nations have flared since the US reimposed sanctions on Iran last year over its nuclear programme. India is heavily dependent on imports to meet its oil needs and any spike in prices of crude oil in the international market has a direct bearing on its economy. Not just imports but even domestic crude oil is priced according to global benchmarks..
