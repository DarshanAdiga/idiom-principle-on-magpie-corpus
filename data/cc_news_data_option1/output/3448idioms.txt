But sometimes it’s just one of those days. As you push on the pedals, something isn’t quite right. Is that disc rotor rubbing? Are your gears jumping? As your team car pulls alongside you, the problem is described with great technical detail, usually along the lines of “my gears are f*cked”.

During Edmunds testing, an X4 xDrive 28i came to a stop from 60 mph in 122 feet, an average performance among similarly sized luxury crossovers.
 ## Driving
 Both of the X4's engines are absolutely first-rate. The "base" turbo four- cylinder packs a real wallop when you put your foot in it, pressing you back in your seat and making a mockery of its claimed 240-hp output. The xDrive35i, meanwhile, is quick enough to keep up with a number of high-performance sport sedans. Shifts come quickly yet smoothly from the sharp transmission, making the otherwise welcome shift paddles seem superfluous in most scenarios. In short, there aren't any weaknesses in the X4's powertrain portfolio.

Milwaukee needed five games to dispatch Orlando in a series that ended Saturday; the Heat swept Indiana in the first round. Miami has had a week off to get ready, part of that time including the stoppage of the playoffs — which started when the Bucks wouldn’t take the floor on Wednesday in protest of the shooting of Jacob Blake, a Black man, by police in Kenosha, Wisconsin.

Annoyingly, the mechanics had cut right through each of them, rendering them useless. I’d have happily taken that bag of tubs and had the punctured inner tubes repaired. It would have been around a grand’s worth of lovely Vittoria tubulars for about £200 (a repair from Brown’s costs £14). As both a user of tubular tyres and a lover of a bargain, I was properly livid.

Should you encounter any problems, Parcours doesn't really go wildly above and beyond when it comes to warranty and crash replacement, but it's all fair and square. The Strade wheelset comes with the standard-fare full two-year manufacturer's warranty should anything be faulty, and in the event of a crash, it offers a 'substantial discount' on any replacement rims, and wholesale pricing for replacement parts.

The wheels arrived with rim tape provided and a freehub spacer for 8, 9 or 10-speed cassettes. They weighed in at 1,520g for the pair, so not the lightest set of wheels on the market around this depth, but certainly not heavy either. Parcours promises smooth running in all weathers from the machined alloy hubs with EZO cartridge bearings and a Centerlock disc fitment, and, as with pretty much all road disc brake wheelsets nowadays, they're fitted for 12mm thru-axles out of the box (adapter kits are available for other axle standards).

If you're looking for X4 alternatives, there aren't many that fall into the same category. You've got to try the 2016 BMW X3, of course, but it's a traditional crossover with a different look altogether. The sleek 2016 Porsche Macan is a tough match-up with its superior power and handling, but it might be hard to find one you want in the X4's price range. As for the 2016 Land Rover Range Rover Evoque, it certainly has head-turning looks, but its mandatory turbo four-cylinder engine is rather unappetizing, and its handling is no great shakes, either.

Both devices come with metal chassis that can fold into a tablet like device if you so choose. Also, the 14" model has an optional model with leather on the display lid. With WiFi6, an all-day battery, and topping out at 4.4 pounds, either device should be perfectly capable for on the go productivity and some light gaming depending on what you play. The only downside is that the I/O is limited to Thunderbolt, so one will need a dongle or dock to have USB devices.

Parcours tested the Strade in the wind tunnel against its existing 56mm deep Passista Disc wheelset, using a set of Fulcrum Racing 5 wheels as a baseline, and found the Strade outperformed the Passista across the board: tested at a speed of 40km/h, the Strade made a 58-second saving against the baseline with 28mm tubeless tyres, compared to a 37-second saving for the Passista. The Strade even outperformed the Passista with 25mm tyres by a couple of seconds, and analysis of the handling performance showed the Strade's front wheel had a 15% reduction in sideforce impact compared to the Passista.

At the end of the day, then, the 2016 BMW X4 has more going for it than the skeptics might think. It's easy to fixate on the similar X3's superior versatility, but if you look at what else is out there, you'll see that the Edmunds "B" rated X4 could actually make sense for the right shopper.

Sharpton called Boseman an important pillar that humanized several Black historical trailblazers in his roles — including color-line breaking baseball star Jackie Robinson, legendary singer James Brown and the first African American U.S. Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall. Boseman’s family said he endured “countless surgeries and chemotherapy” while portraying King T’Challa of Wakanda in the Oscar-nominated “Black Panther,” a film that proved a person of color could lead in a successful superhero film.
 “For him to pass at this time when we are disproportionately affected by COVID and have all of these attacks by law enforcement, and him being the symbol bringing us to Wakanda, it’s just a blow,” Sharpton said. “To hear that our superhero who projected a positive light was now gone, it was a gut blow.”
 Boseman was elevated to a stage that many Black actors don’t get the chance to occupy, said Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James. And his ability to be “transcendent” on that stage brought a comic book character to life for many in the Black community.
 “Even though we knew that it was like a fictional story, it actually felt real. It actually felt like we finally had our Black superhero and nobody could touch us. So to lose that, it’s sad in our community,” James said, lamenting on the loss of “the Black Panther and the Black Mamba in the same year.”
 In January, Bryant died in a helicopter crash involving eight others including his 13-year-old daughter, Gianna. Lewis died in July after being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer last year.
 Other notable deaths this year include actress Naya Rivera, civil rights leader C.T. Vivian, music executive Andre Harrell and Hall of Fame Georgetown basketball coach John Thompson, who was the first Black coach to lead a team to an NCAA championship and prioritized academics to his athletes.
 “The year 2020 has been up and down for everybody,” Milwaukee Bucks player Giannis Antetokounmpo said, adding that Boseman left “so much behind.”
 “It’s a lot to unpack,” said Oklahoma City Thunder guard Chris Paul. “Chadwick was a special guy. I think everyone took it hard, especially the Black community. That was one of our black superheroes. I think ‘Black Panther’ was something so powerful, for myself along with my kids to see a superhero that looks like them and the way that he played it with such class and elegance. That was tough.”
