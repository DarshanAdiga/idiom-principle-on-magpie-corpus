The empathy and compassion shown to them sets the standards for how they will treat each other and how committed they will be to carrying the organization’s plan.”          Daniels, an international business and research consultant, said workers need to show their employers understanding in these situations, as they are also going through the pandemic.           “Employees must remember managers need empathy and compassion, too,” Daniels said on the website. “Leaders also work long hours and are concerned about their health and well-being, so it’s important for everyone to remember it’s a two-way street.”                  *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

Guarnieri welcomed the move, saying the lab had shared its findings with Norwegian authorities. "The Norwegian app is deeply intrusive and put people's privacy at risk.

"There are better options available that balance the need to trace the spread of the disease with privacy... This episode should act as a warning to all governments rushing ahead with apps that are invasive and designed in a way that puts human rights at risk. Privacy doesn't need to be a casualty in the rollout of these apps."

Racism is at the root of the migration policies through which the EU systematically avoids sea rescue off the north African coast, leaving countless people to drown and die at sea, or to be sent back to civil war, arbitrary detention and torture.
 Carola Rackete, the former captain of the Sea Watch 3 rescue ship, addressed similar words to those who believe that state racism is someone else's problem, adding her voice to the thousands that have gathered up in these days of social rebellion in support of the Black Lives Matter movement.
 Just as systematic racism is entrenched in the US police and prison system, we argue that Europe is no different when it comes to the racism and violence of border security against black lives of refugees and migrants trying to escape the hell of Libya among other places.
 The central Mediterranean is one of the deadliest routes undertaken by asylum seekers attempting their way to Europe. In 2019, about fifteen thousand people reached Europe, while more than seven hundred lost their lives at sea. Just days ago, the news arrived that a boat carrying 22 people was found shipwrecked just off the Tunisian coast, with all its passengers currently missing, most likely drowned.
 These numbers are low if compared to the 120.000 who landed in Italy alone in 2017. Such a considerable downturn is the outcome of an international strategy implemented by EU governments, with Italy at the forefront, aimed to bolster the bastions of the European fortress on the Mediterranean. By progressively withdrawing both governmental and non-governmental rescue assets at sea, border control is being outsourced to the so-called Libyan Coast Guard – _de facto_ militias involved in the Libyan civil war – by providing them with equipment, as well as with technical and political support.

The inter-Korean liaison office that Pyongyang blew up on Tuesday was opened in September 2018 as part of an agreement the North's leader Kim Jong Un and the South's President Moon Jae-in signed at their first summit five months earlier.          The office occupied a four-storey building in an industrial zone in the North's city of Kaesong, where companies from South Korea employed Northerners, paying Pyongyang for their labour.           It was the first permanent physical communication centre for the two sides, with personnel from North and South staying at the compound to enable face-to-face contact at any time.          Southern officials occupied the second floor, with Northern representatives on the top level and meeting rooms inbetween.           Around 20 officials from each side were based there, headed by a vice minister-level appointee.          When it opened, a rapid diplomatic rapprochement was in full swing on and around the peninsula, with Kim and Moon about to hold their third summit in the wake of Kim's historic meeting with US President Donald Trump in Singapore.          At the time Seoul's unification ministry said it would become a "round-the-clock consultation and communication channel" for advancing inter-Korean relations, improving ties between the US and the North, and easing military tensions.          The office was open five days a week, with officials on standby for weekends.          But inter-Korean ties entered a deep freeze following the collapse of the Hanoi summit between Kim and Trump, and operations at the office were suspended in January because of the coronavirus pandemic.          Kaesong, site of the liaison office, was initially part of the South after Moscow and Washington divided Korea between them in the closing days of World War II, but found itself in the North after the 1950-53 Korean War, which ended in an armistice rather than a peace treaty.          The joint industrial zone was set up in 2004, under the presidency of the liberal Roh Moo-hyun in the South.          But president Park Geun-hye shuttered it in 2016 in response to the North's nuclear and missile tests, saying profits generated from it were linked to Pyongyang's weapons development.                   *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

SPOKANE — Matt Shea is giving up his seat in the Washington House of Representatives, but he hasn’t given up his dream of creating a 51st state out of the eastern half of the state.          Shea spoke Saturday at a rally in Coeur d’Alene, Idaho, that featured many prominent figures in the far-right “patriot” movement.          The Spokesman-Review reports that Shea vowed to continue pushing for the creation of a 51st state called Liberty, separate from liberal Seattle and the rest of western Washington.          Shea says he wants to put on the issue on the ballot for this November in every county in eastern Washington.                  *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

Mihai Eminescu has "unveiled" the soul in its purest forms, said on Monday the president of the Romanian Academy, Ioan-Aurel Pop, who urged that at least today, on the 131st anniversary of the poet's death, we do not criticize him.          "In adolescence, we learned that on January 15 and June 15, we are entitled to think of Eminescu as our homeland. I never asked why, because it was in the nature of things. My Latin teacher would have said est modus in rebus, I mean it is in the order of things to be like that. Much later, I noticed that, for some, it was not exactly right to be so, and today I am terrified that, writing with love about the author of 'Poor Dionis', I can be accused of being offensive or downright derogatory. Now, when I see that Harriet Beecher Stowe with her 'Uncle Tom''s Hut' is forbidden, that Margaret Mitchell, after whom the famous film 'Gone with the Wind' was made, is put in the corner or that the explorer Christopher Columbus - the unknowing discoverer America - is suppressed the second time, 'in effigy', by tearing down his statue, I am no longer surprised by anything," Pop declared for AGERPRES.                  *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

Ironically, Kenyans continue to be arrested and placed under a 14-day mandatory quarantine for breaching the coronavirus regulations. Initially, those arrested were asked to foot the bill for their own quarantine. But on 6 May, having noticed people had grown averse of voluntary tests, the government stepped in and said it would cover the isolation expenses. Even so, those in isolation centres complain of mistreatment, negligence, lack of medical care and sanitary facilities.                  *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

The Rotary Club of Baytown’s $5,000 donation to the Houston Methodist Infectious Diseases Research Fund became a $10,000 contribution after being matched by a group of philanthropic leaders.
 The Rotary Club’s donation was matched by a Challenge Fund created by Ann and John Bookout, Diane and David Modesett and the Jerold B. Katz Foundation.
 The Infectious Diseases Research Fund is managed by the Houston Methodist Academic Institute, home to world-class researchers and scientists involved in more than 800 active clinical trials.
 Members of the Infectious Diseases group are working around the clock on promising treatments and therapies to fight COVID-19. In March, the work of the group played a key role in helping Houston Methodist become the first hospital in the country to use an advanced FDA-approved protocol to transfuse donated plasma from a recovered COVID-19 patient to a critically ill patient.
