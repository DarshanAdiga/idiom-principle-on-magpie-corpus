In a nutshell, therefore, the Indian Navy has an aspiration for five SSBNs, six SSNs and 18 SSKs to meet its emerging security challenges in the strategic, operational and tactical domains. Submarines are expensive to build and require very specialised skills and a sustained building programme with committed funding support to retain those skills. This has not been forthcoming and needs to be addressed at the earliest in the interest of our national security and foreign policy objectives.

 Sheridan was given a five-match touchline ban following the incident and was sacked earlier this month after a 4-0 loss to Cambridge United - the club's ninth successive League Two defeat.
 The former Chesterfield, Plymouth and Newport manager, who took over as Latics manager 10 days after leaving Meadow Lane, was dismissed by referee Eddie Ilderton following his outburst during the Wycombe game on 10 December.
 In the referee's report, Ilderton said Sheridan repeatedly swore at fourth official Matthew Donohue and also threatened to "knock him out".
 Hardy added: "Comments of the type made by Mr Sheridan were utterly appalling and wholly unacceptable, completely undermining the community spirit and focus we are striving to develop here.
 "It was our decision to terminate the contract based on what I read in the referee's report regarding the incident.
 "In light of the recent disclosure of the referee's report, I thought it appropriate to communicate the exact reasons behind the course of action we took."
 Kevin Nolan was appointed as Notts County's new manager on 12 January, the same day Sheridan took charge at Oldham.

What particularly struck me about Chuck's piece is that it is in direct disagreement with the general notion that high unemployment is on the wane and that it is nothing to be concerned about at this point in time. This article should give us all pause as we assess the markets' environment. Consequently, I bring it to your attention today.
 Tradeweb released some interesting data last week. Europe's pool of negative- yielding government bonds declined in December to its smallest size since May. Eurozone government bonds indicated that the negative yielding sovereign debt fell to 4.14 trillion euros in December. This is about 52% of the total eight trillion-euro sovereign debt market. The latest figures are down from 57% in November.
 In September, the negative-yielding government bonds surged to the highest level ever, at 5.63 trillion euros, or about 70% of all sovereign debt in Europe, which were in the red. As for the global pool of negative-yielding bonds, it peaked at around $17 trillion last year and has been estimated by Tradeweb to be around $12 trillion today.
 The cause for all of the never before seen in human history negative yields, are the major central banks of the world. They have printed "Pixie Dust" money from nothing but computerized air and then bought debt with it so that the governments that they represent can borrow at nothing, or less than nothing, and so that their taxpayers do not have to pay for their budgets or social programs. It is a great trick, bordering on magic, when an administration no longer has to pay anything to run the government.
 "Disbelief in magic can force a poor soul into believing in government and business."
 \- Tom Robbins
 One focus then in 2020 is going to be on the central banks. Will the European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan, the People's Bank of China, and then the Fed, continue to ramp up their balance sheets and buy more sovereign and corporate debt? The unfolding answer will determine bond yields, and the equity market's performance, more than any other single factor, in my opinion.

The Fighting Saints used a fast break 10 minutes to outscore the home team 4-0, then cruised to a 8-2 victory in USHL action.
 The visitors wasted little time to flex their muscle as they took advantage of an early power play.
 Riese Gaber popped the net a minute into the man advantage, then Dylan Jackson registered another power play tally seven minutes later for a 3-0 lead.
 Reggie Millette sandwiched an even strength goal between the two Black Hawks penalty kills.
 Dubuque came into the game ranked second in the USHL in power play goals.
 To add insult to injury the Saints were awarded a penalty shot late in the first, which Jackson turned into a point, and the Black Hawks were in a deep 4-0 hole.
 “We weren’t ready to go, that’s all there is to it,” said Black Hawks coach P.K. O’Handley. “Our special teams were horrific and we lost this game in every which way you can. We did a lot of bad things and we had a bone headed play to give up the fifth goal, it just was horrific. We need to let this soak in a bit and then just turn the page and move on.”
 Nothing worked well for the Hawks throughout the opening frame, as they failed to convert on a two-on-one break, where the shot sailed high and wide of the net with 1:20 remaining.
 The time between the periods proved helpful to the Hawks as they came out in the second frame with a little more fire.
 Ryder Rolston began the short rally grabbing the puck from Joey Cassetti from a faceoff, and quickly slammed it home knocking the goose egg off the scoreboard.
 Ten minutes later, Ryan Drkulec found the back of the net cutting the deficit to 4-2.
 “I felt 100 percent that we got the momentum, when we got the first goal back,” said Rolston, who will be going to Notre Dame. “I think everybody thought we had momentum on our side and we picked up another one to cut it to 4-2. Unfortunately we gave up that late fifth goal and that just changed everything.” It was Ralston’s 13th goal of the season, and he leads the Black Hawks in that category.
 With a little momentum riding the Waterloo bench, Matthew Kopperud was successful on a three-on-two break for the Saints, scoring with 28 seconds left to take away the Hawks edge.

 The Missouri General Assembly meets for more than four months each year and consistently has little to show for its efforts.
 Given that limitation, a list of do's and don'ts for 2020 makes sense as legislators convene next week.
 Start with the don'ts. There is no reason for legislators to try to undo what 62 percent of the voters approved in 2018 with the Clean Missouri initiative. That effort cuts down on such things as lobbyist gifts to legislators, but what really upset Republican leaders in Jefferson City is the attempt to get a handle on gerrymandering legislative districts. That is the chief means by which the party in power in Jefferson City tries to stay in power.
 Republican leaders have made it clear that stopping Clean Missouri is among their top priorities. But the voters have spoken, and the plan they adopted should go forward.
 If they set that aside, legislators would have more time to:
 • Find funding and a solid plan to process the 7,000 untested rape kits across the state. These are from victims who have come forward, and they are being denied justice. This is inexcusable.
 • Get to the bottom of why thousands of children have been dropped from Medicaid rolls, when other states have not seen similar declines. The fact that no one in power in Jefferson City wants to talk about it doesn't mean it's not important.
 • Reverse a bad law from several years ago that undercuts cities' abilities to enforce their own traffic laws. There is in effect no sanction for those who just don't pay a ticket and don't show in court to contest it. Let cities do their jobs.
 • Put an end to the so-called \"gray machine\" gambling devices that have cropped up at convenience stores and elsewhere across the state. There are an estimated 14,000 of them, and the Missouri Gaming Commission has determined that they are illegal. They are unregulated and untaxed, meaning less for schools and other services that legal gambling in Missouri supports. This may take more courage than legislators can muster, since the company behind these machines is politically connected.
 • Go slowly and carefully on allowing sports betting.
 • Pay the state's bills. Missouri is millions of dollars in arrears on its obligations to pay counties for inmates held on state charges - $3.5 million to Jackson County alone.
 Finally, there are the larger issues that evade significant action year after year.
 The sharp rise in gun violence in Missouri is the direct result of policies enacted by this legislative body. At the very least, if the state won't act, it can let cities take the steps they deem necessary to protect the lives of their citizens.
 The state's roads and bridges are significantly underfunded, the effects are evident, and it's holding Missouri back. Education and workforce development - a critical need in the state - go hand in hand, but the state lacks an overall vision and has been content to muddle along in a time when that's just not good enough. Gov. Mike Parson has said these are his highest priorities; the Legislature hasn't been listening.

A Cabinet secretary in the administration of Gov. Laura Kelly convened an unadvertised auction in a state senator's office Thursday to sell the second- biggest typical deer antler rack in recorded Kansas history that was at the center of a celebrated ownership feud because the buck was shot by a poacher in Osage County.
 Possession of the 14-point rack inspired an emotional legal and political dispute between landowner Tim Nedeau, who claimed rights to the trophy illegally shot in 2011, and Kansas Department of Wildlife, Parks and Tourism officials who contended Nedeau shouldn't receive the ill-gotten mount worth thousands of dollars. Even after conviction of poacher David Kent, of Topeka, and changes to state law giving landowners first-refusal rights to game from illegal hunting, the rack remained in the agency's hands.
 The monster's head will soon be on the move.
 Brad Loveless, secretary of the Department of Wildlife, Parks and Tourism, said in an interview he took the initiative to resolve the conflict by convening the meeting and conducting the accompanying auction in the office of Senate Minority Leader Anthony Hensley. The Democratic senator said he was surprised by the deal-closing auction because he thought the gathering was about negotiating a settlement.
 Loveless said invited bidders were Nedeau and a representative of Bass Pro Shops, which made an opening offer of $10,000. Nedeau responded with a bid of $10,001. That back-and-forth cycle repeated itself until Nedeau prevailed at $16,001.
 "We didn't advertise it. We didn't go through that process," said Loveless, who solicited involvement from Bass Pro Shops. "By no means were we trying to shut anyone out. We wanted to give him (Nedeau) a chance at this."
 The Cabinet secretary said proceeds from the sale would be deposited in the Operation Game Thief account, which provides rewards to people providing information to authorities leading to conviction of poachers. The secretary said consideration was given to burning the antlers, but the decision was made to generate needed funding for the anti-poaching program.
 The method of sale went against the grain because Kansas government agencies frequently dispose of surplus equipment and materials through the Manhattan- based Purplewave online auction house. The state sells everything from used prison denim jackets to snowplow trucks on a website open to the public for around-the-clock bidding.
 Nedeau, who previously won an $8,000 court judgment from the poacher, said he didn't want to discuss the transaction until he was in possession of the antlers.
 "No comment," he said.
 Rep. Ken Corbet, a Shawnee County Republican who advocated at the Statehouse on behalf of Nedeau's claim he should be given the deer's head, said he attended the meeting along with Hensley and state Rep. Brenda Dietrich, R-Topeka. All three serve constituents involved in the case.
 Corbet said the decision by the Department of Wildlife, Parks and Tourism to conduct a closed auction with participation of Bass Pro Shops meant the hunting, camping and fishing supply retailer based in Springfield, Mo., would set the minimum price Nedeau would pay to acquire the trophy. Decor of the company's stores includes taxidermy mounts native to the local area.
 "This was no more than Wildlife and Parks being a bully, thumbing its nose at the Legislature and landowners," said Corbet, who owns Ravenwood Lodge, a hunting and shooting facility outside Topeka. "I thought it would be a resolution where they just give him the antlers."
 Hensley said he had been told the meeting in his Capitol office would be to discuss a resolution, but he wasn't warned about the auction. Hensley said the Cabinet secretary used a cellphone to bring the Bass Pro Shop representative into the conversation.
 "I had no idea that this is what was going to happen," the Topeka Democratic senator said. "I had no idea they were going to have an auction. I think it was really mishandled."
 Kent told state wildlife officials he was driving to get firewood on Nov. 11, 2011, when he saw the buck near the intersection of 133rd Street and Wanamaker Road, a rural area south of Topeka. He fired two shots from a 9mm Glock. The animal went down 50 yards from his vehicle. Kent ran to the buck, decapitated it with a knife, wrapped the head in a blanket and drove off.
 In 2012, state wildlife department officers seized the antlers at the Kansas Expocentre in Topeka, where Kent entered them in the Mossy Oak Buck Classic. Nedeau sought a salvage tag for the buck since it died on his property in Osage County. In 2013, Nedeau appealed to Gov. Sam Brownback to release the antlers to him.
 The Legislature passed a bill in 2014 granting landowners first chance to claim animal parts if game was taken illegally on their land, but the measure signed by Brownback wasn't retroactive. The Department of Wildlife, Parks and Tourism subsequently balked at giving the antlers to Nedeau after determining the land where the buck died was owned by Nedeau's mother.

Nuclear-powered attack submarines (SSN), armed with conventional cruise missiles, are very versatile and extremely effective platforms which should be integral to a blue-water navy. Their speed, stealth and endurance greatly enhances a navy’s offensive options and they can operate either independently or as part of a naval task force. Armed with lethal land-attack cruise missiles, besides the traditional torpedoes, they are the ideal platforms to shape the battlespace at an operational level of conflict and also influence the outcome on land with their ability to strike targets on land from stand- off ranges at sea. India presently has one SSN, which is an Akula-2 class submarine on lease from Russia for 10 years since 2012. Media reports indicate that the lease of another Akula-2 class SSN is being negotiated as a replacement.

Chairman of the Joint Chiefs General Mark Milley publicly addressed the issue of potential retaliation from Iran Friday. When asked whether there is now a risk to U.S. safety in the region, Milley bluntly said, “Damn right there is risk.”
 Officials from the National Security Council, State Department, Pentagon and intelligence agencies echoed that concern during classified briefings Friday, making it clear that it is not a question of if Iran will respond, but when, where and how, a source with knowledge of what was discussed told CNN.
 National security officials were blunt as they described a range of retaliatory possibilities inside the U.S. and abroad. The goal, one administration official familiar with the briefing said, was to make sure lawmakers were “cleared-eyed” about the possibilities for Iranian retaliation and that nothing was sugar coated.
 ## Deadly fires threaten Australia’s way of life
 Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison may have thought a visit to a fire- ravaged town would help boost his image after a series of stumbles in handling the country’s bushfire crisis.
 That plan backfired Thursday in Cobargo, in the state of New South Wales, where residents made no bones about their anger.
 “You won’t be getting any votes down here, buddy. You’re an idiot. Who votes Liberal round here? Nobody. No Liberal votes. You’re out son. You are out,” one man said, referring to Morrison’s conservative party, according to footage from CNN affiliate Nine News. “Go on, piss off!”
 Another woman called the Australian leader a “d---head,” while yet another said she would only shake his hand if he agreed to give more money to the country’s volunteer firefighters. The embarrassed Prime Minister could do nothing but get back in his car and drive away.
 Deadly blazes have torn through huge swaths of Australia’s east and south for months now, in the most brutal fire season seen there in years. Across the country, 23 people have been killed and about 23,000 square miles of bushland — around the same size as Croatia — have burned out.
 The devastation and persistent clouds of toxic smoke hanging over major towns and cities are begging the question, can Australia’s way of life go on?
  _—From wire reports_
 The environmental situation won’t change quickly, but in the dog-eat-dog world of Australian politics, the country’s leadership is something that could change overnight. Climate and energy policies can make or break a leader.
 Morrison could be in trouble over the fire crisis. He was forced to return from a family holiday when the Australian media questioned why he was vacationing in Hawaii as so much of the country burned. He took weeks to declare a state of emergency, releasing a highly controversial religious discrimination bill at a news conference instead, while journalists fired tough questions at him over a lack of funding for volunteer firefighters.
 Morrison — once a climate change skeptic who literally sang praises to a lump of coal in the Australian parliament — should be worried about what people think of him in towns like Cobargo. The constituency has swung between the Liberal party and its center-left Labor rival several times since the 1940s and is one of Australia’s most reliable bellwether seats.
 Most Australians want tougher action on climate change, according to the Australian Institute’s Climate of the Nation survey. Some 81% of Australians are concerned that global warming will result in more droughts and flooding, while 64% think Australia should have a national target for net zero emissions by 2050.

Table Rock Dam occasionally frustrates some anglers on Taneycomo Lake by releasing millions of gallons of ice-cold lake water. This controlled deluge floods through Taneycomo, bouncing docks and covering up islands of rocks and small trees.
 Many find the current is difficult to fish when the big waters are released and avoid it. Professional guides on this unique stretch - noted as one of the world's most prolific trout lakes - take out clients in all conditions.
 Duane Doty, owner of Ozark Trout Runners, is one of Taneycomo's fishing gurus and a top guide. He lives and breathes fishing on his favorite lake and serves returning clients annually. His reputation is well earned. He once competed in Taneycomo trout tournaments until his competition decided that him entering these contests was unfair - he is just that good!
 I joined Doty on a cold, mercifully windless morning when Table Rock Dam was releasing water from four chutes, causing high-water conditions on Taneycomo. Three generators were running at 9,653-cubic feet per second (CFS) from five floodgates dumping another 5,100 CFS for a total of 14,753 CFS - or in terms most of us will understand, a lot of water filled Taneycomo's banks.
 We had hopes of catching a big brown trout. Doty handed me a spinning rig with a unique looking plastic jerk bait to resemble shad. I took a long look at the lure that was crafted and painted by Doty.
 "I used to fish productive lures that were expensive here," Doty said. "Losing two or three might cost a hundred-dollar bill. So I started painting my own lures in rainbow trout, sculpin minnow or shad colors. To date I have made about 1,500 lures, and they are productive here. I tie a lot of feathered jigs too. But today I want you to try this long, white jerk bait."
 The beautiful lure Doty had created was topped with several coats of paint. I was warned that brown trout might not be all we catch; walleye from the bottom of Table Rock Lake were possible. I never turn down walleye fillets.
 "The Missouri Department of Conservation doesn't stock walleye in Lake Taneycomo," Doty explained. "Walleye and other warm water species come through the floodgates of Table Rock Dam. Bigger fish may not survive, but many pan- sized walleyes will. The bite can be exciting after floodgates have been opened and shad are pouring through. A few walleyes hang up by the gate and provide a good bite. We've had a lot of floodgate activity this year and are seeing quite a few walleye as a result."
 My first three casts were practice runs developing my lure jerking action to match Doty's. The fourth cast produced a strike and a pleasant surprise when the first walleye was netted. The slender fish fought well and measured long enough to enter our livewell.
 Minutes later Doty set the hook on a bigger walleye that made several hard runs before being netted. His "eye" was about 3 ½ pounds with sharp teeth and a lot of fight left while flopping in the net.
 "This is what we're after," Doty said. "Keep the lure as close to the bank as possible and be ready for a strike on the pause. They hit hard and sometimes may hook themselves."
 Sadly, my next jolt was a quick hit and miss when a good-sized walleye bit and released my stick bait - I'm not sure how. Those trebles were razor sharp and I almost hooked my finger on them several times while clearing tangled line or hooks that occasionally connect while the lure is in flight, ruining the shad imitation's action.
 "Before the lure hits water, reel a couple of times to take out slack," Doty suggested. "That will help you keep the trebles straight and they won't tangle as often."
 I tried his reeling method and it worked. We caught a couple more walleye before the bite stopped. A sudden golden flash signaled a big brown trout attacking my lure. I set the hook and held on a couple of good runs before the trout somehow threw the lure and its sharp trebles.
 "One of the biggest browns I personally caught here was a 17 and three-quarter pounder, on a jig while browns were busting shad." Doty said. "I decided to start targeting bigger fish and now catch and release between 150 to 200 trophy fish over 20 inches per year."
 We changed tactics and started drifting weighted scuds off the bottom while slipping sideways in the current. Scuds or freshwater shrimp are transparent and take on color from food they eat. For example, scuds feeding on dark olive plant matter will take on a dark olive hue, while those eating tan items will develop a tan hue. Scud flies often range in size from just over half an inch down to about one-16th of an inch. Several smaller rainbow trout hit and were caught and released using the bouncing scud method.
 "January and February are exciting times to fish Taneycomo," Doty said. "We have a lot of threadfin shad die off and filter through the turbines of Table Rock Dam. During this period, fish white lures and you might catch big trout, walleye or even bass. The crowds are less then and on occasion you might have the entire lake to yourself. I may only have a couple guide trips a month and have a lot of time to go out and fish on my own. I am on the water every chance I get and constantly learn something new about catching Taneycomo fish."
 The trip finally ended and the next night walleye fillets with brown rice graced our dinner table. Fresh walleye cooked shortly after being taken from cold water is as good as it gets. Wish I had more!
 January and February are excellent times to fish on Taneycomo with Doty. You can contact him on Facebook at Ozark Trout Runners, or call 417-294-8672.

Vance McShane, a Freeport graduate, helped Saint Xavier University make it to the NAIA football playoffs this season.
 They made it to the quarterfinals, before losing to the Morningside College Mustangs, 51-0. Morningside went on to win the national championship for the second straight year.
 In an opening round 25-20 win over Northwestern College, McShane had 98 rushing yards on 24 carries and seven catches for 38 yards. He shined even more against the defending national champions. McShane had 72 rushing yards on six carries, caught four passes for 26 yards and had three kickoff returns for 63 yards.
 "Losing in the second round was a little disappointing," McShane said. "Our goal as a team was to win the national championship. My personal goal was to be an NAIA All-American.
 "Speed is my main concern. It always is for a skill player. My main goal for next year is to get faster, and I also want to work more at slot receiver so I can get more deep passes thrown to me in 2020."
 McShane, a sophomore, was a second team all-conference selection in the Mid- States Football Association. He was a second team selection as a freshman as well. In league play, McShane carried the ball 65 times for 290 yards. He caught 10 passes for 60 yards. He had five rushing touchdowns and one receiving touchdown. He also had seven kickoff returns for 149 yards to finish with a total of 499 all-purpose yards in MSFA-Midwest play.
 McShane helped Saint Xavier post a 9-3 mark overall. They were 6-0 in the MSFA-Midwest.
 "I hope the coaches in the league that voted for me saw a running back that runs with purpose," the former Pretzel star said.

The electricity was as good as it gets last Sunday at Arrowhead Stadium. The Chiefs finished off a 12-4 regular season, winning the AFC West for the fourth straight year.
 The Chiefs have not been very lucky in key situations for the last 50 years, but last Sunday that luck changed. Head coach Andy Reid and every Chiefs fan needs to sing hail to the Dolphins for beating New England to give Kansas City the No. 2 seed and a first-round playoff bye. The team has not gotten key breaks for way too many years.
 They now have an opportunity to make a positive run in the playoffs. This year's Chiefs are better than the Chiefs team that played in the AFC Championship game against the Patriots last year.
 First of all, the defense is head and shoulders better than the 2018 version. Defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo has done a slow but steady job in making the defense a force to be reckoned with.
 The improvement at the safety position has been key. Tyrann Mathieu has proven to be a great leader who plays with an aggressive mindset. The knee injury to the rookie safety Juan Thornhill came at a bad time, but Chiefs fans should not hang their heads. Safety Armani Watts can play.
 The defensive line has gotten better every game. Chris Jones is dominating. Frank Clark has come alive at the last half of the season and is playing with Pro Bowl capability. Rookie Khalen Saunders has been much better than advertised. Nose guard Derrick Nnadi should have been selected to the Pro Bowl.
 Brett Veach did a great job of picking up defensive end Demone Harris and defensive tackle Mike Pennel. They have provided quality depth. The addition of soon-to-be Hall of Famer Terrell Suggs can only help provide more pressure down the stretch. The man can still rush the passer.
 The linebackers were the weakest group last year and they have improved since the 2018 season. It seems Spagnuolo has sold the linebackers on each individual strength, and he will see that each will use those strengths when the need arises. Reggie Ragland did not have a good 2018 season but is playing a positive role for this year's defensive squad.
 The special teams have really come along since the debacle in Tennessee. Mecole Hardman has been a difference maker on returns and has been a big play receiver. Harrison Butker has been a true stallion in 2019. He will have to respond in the playoffs if the Chiefs want to move on to the Super Bowl. Dustin Colquitt has always remained consistent. That is big. A solid punter is a best friend for defenses. Field position is huge in the playoffs.
 The offense is still one of the top three in the National Football League. When Damien Williams is healthy, you have a guy in the backfield who has the speed to break a game open at any time.
 The Chiefs have the best receiving crew and the fastest as a group in the NFL. Tyreek Hill is a difference maker. Sammy Watkins may be the best No. 3 receiver in the league. Travis Kelce is a Hall of Famer getting ready to happen. Demarcus Robinson is the No. 4 receiver and that means he is the best No. 4 in the league. If Byron Pringle had the chance, he would be consistent because he is a great runner after the catch. Mecole Hardman is a touchdown waiting to happen on every catch. The receiver corps is simply loaded.
 The offensive line, when everyone is healthy, is as good as any in football. This group has played a lot of snaps together and they really have Andy Reid's offensive scheme down. In the last six weeks they have cut down the number of penalties they were picking up during the stretch when the team lost four out of five games.
 Of course, the biggest asset of this team is obviously still a quarterback who can lead a team to the promised land. However, this team is not all about Patrick Mahomes. Mahomes has been just average in the six-game winning streak, but he has been taking what the defenses are giving him and is relying on his teammates to make plays.
 Football is a team game, and everyone has to do their part in order to be a champion. Hopefully the Kansas City Chiefs can match a talented team with a little luck and finally return to the Super Bowl. The opportunity is definitely close, so Chiefs fans cross those fingers and believe this may be the year.

On Friday, Trump justified Soleimani's killing by saying the Iranian was "plotting imminent and sinister attacks on American diplomats and military personnel, but we caught him in the act and terminated him."

Also note the orientation of the plugs. While holding them both facing you, the sideways “neutral” blades are reversed on the left and right side of the picture. That is, the male plug has its neutral blade on the left, while the female plug has its neutral blade on the right. That’s because they’re designed to be rotated 90 degrees to mate when making a connection, in which case the neutral, hot, and ground blades will match up. This single idea is what gets lots of RVers in trouble when putting a new plug on an extension cord.

The body of Gen. Qassem Soleimani, who was killed in a U.S. drone strike, arrived Sunday in Iran to throngs of mourners, as President Donald Trump threatened to bomb 52 sites in the Islamic Republic if Tehran retaliates by attacking Americans
 Soleimani’s death Friday in Iraq further heightens tensions between Tehran and Washington after months of trading attacks and threats that put the wider Middle East on edge. The conflict is rooted in Trump pulling out of Iran’s nuclear deal with world powers, an accord likely to further unravel as Tehran is expected to announce as early as Sunday it will break another set of limits.
 Iran has promised “harsh revenge.” Already, a series of rockets launched in Baghdad late Saturday fell inside or near the Green Zone, which houses government offices and foreign embassies, including the U.S. Embassy.
 Trump wrote on Twitter afterward that the U.S. had already “targeted 52 Iranian sites (representing the 52 American hostages taken by Iran many years ago), some at a very high level & important to Iran & the Iranian culture.”

India is a nuclear weapons power with ‘No First Use’ as the cornerstone of its nuclear doctrine. Hence, a credible deterrence and invulnerable second-strike capability is essential, for both of which a submarine is the most effective platform as it provides stealth, surprise and concealment. Presently, India has one nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarine (SSBN) INS Arihant, which was built indigenously and completed her first deterrent patrol successfully in November 2018. India thus became only the sixth nation, after the Big Five (US, UK, Russia, France and China), with this capability. However, for deterrence and second strike to be credible, the continuous presence of a SSBN at sea is essential, for which a force level of 4-5 SSBNs is required. It is believed that India is in the process of building this capability.

Louis F Schauer of Riverside died on December 20. Lou was a most generous man, not only with his means but with his time. Lou was a gregarious man with a fine sense of how to tell a story; he had a ready smile and a quick wit. Lou was born in Chicago on December 4, 1928 to Mary Vittich Schauer and Frank William Schauer. Lou grew up in Chicago attending public schools and later graduated from Northwestern University in 1949 and Harvard Law School in 1952. Upon graduation from Law School, he served as an officer in the U.S. Air Force. Upon discharge in 1955, Lou joined the Chicago law firm of Lord, Bissell & Brook, becoming a partner in 1963. He remained with the firm until his retirement in 1992. Lou's life took a sharp upturn when he met a young lady, Nancy Wilson, who became his wife. Lou suffered the sadness of having both Nancy and their son, Christopher, predecease him. Lou's older sister, Lorraine, also predeceased him earlier this year. His life was filled with many interests. As a lawyer, Lou responded to a concern in the American business community in the 1970s that an increase in shareholder litigation against directors of large corporations had highlighted the risks individuals assumed in serving on boards of directors. . Lou chaired committees of the American Bar Association, working with a handful of other lawyers, corporate officers and insurance professionals to develop forms for insurance for directors and officers that were then sold to the largest corporations; now this insurance product is sold to organizations of every size. As a partner at Lord, Bissell, Lou developed this practice, founding a department concentrating on issues of liabilities of corporate directors and officers. Lou's legal interests took him into other arenas. Lou served as Village Attorney for Western Springs and later as President of the Board of Trustees of the Village. Lou also served as Chairman of the Western Suburban Mass Transit District. Lou's concern for our world led him to devote substantial energy to the Brookfield Zoo and the Chicago Zoological Society. Lou was a long-time member of the CZS Board of Trustees, served as Secretary of the Board for many years and played a key role in CZS's collaboration with the Australian Government in conserving 850,000 acres of wildlife habitat. He became a Life Trustee in 2005.      Nancy's and Lou's artistic interests led them to the Theater of Western Springs beginning in 1957. Lou served as Business Manager for several years and later as Treasurer. He was on the Theater's first Board of Trustees and also served later terms. He continued to serve on committees of the Theater until his death. During his 62 years of devotion to the Theater, he was cast in 16 plays. Lou also was on the Board of the Chicago Opera Theater. Lou is survived by relatives and friends, the good he did for many, and the memories of those who were fortunate to know him. Info at www.moravecek.com or 708-447-2261.

While some streamers aren’t OK with reuploaders, many turn a blind eye to the practice because, as Asmongold points out, they benefit from it. Twitch is an enormous platform in its own right, but YouTube still dwarfs it with a user base of nearly two billion people. Reuploaders, meanwhile, are doing a form of labour. They’re watching streams that sometimes last 10+ hours, chopping them up into digestible chunks, editing clips together, and figuring out how to package them. That takes substantial time and effort, and it serves an audience of people who might not have time to follow these streamers otherwise. Should they be making money off this while existing in what’s basically a grey area on YouTube’s endless digital frontier, wrangling content that other people worked hard to make? That’s an incredibly thorny question. But the fact is, many people are.

Non si capisce l’originalita dell’approccio di Ricolfi se non si conosce da quale storia intellettuale proviene. L’autore lo confessa nelle prime pagine de “La societa signorile di massa”: il suo maestro era lo storico del pensiero economico Claudio Napoleoni, marxista atipico noto per la sua incessante riflessione sul concetto di valore. Proprio da Napoleoni Ricolfi eredita il concetto di “consumo signorile”, inteso come prelievo da parte di una classe improduttiva del surplus prodotto dalla classe lavoratrice. Se la distinzione tra lavoro produttivo e lavoro improduttivo era servita ai marxisti (ancora fino agli anni 1960 e 1970 in Baran, Sweezy, O’Connor o ancora Mattick) per denunciare gli squilibri distributivi di cui beneficiavano la classe borghese e le burocrazie statali, Claudio Napoleoni aveva avuto l’intuizione che l’Italia fosse afflitta in modo particolarmente acuto dal morbo del lavoro improduttivo e propugnava percio una lotta alle rendite. Mezzo secolo piu tardi, Ricolfi ha provato a tirare le somme. Non stupisce che questa denuncia implicitamente marxista della “sfera della circolazione” sia diventata del tutto illeggibile per la sinistra contemporanea, che in questa sfera si e trasferita integralmente. I frutti del lavoro le arrivano come la luce di una stella lontanissima.

 The advice is to remain calm and not shout, and to not respond to unwanted behaviour.

 The rewards chart was for encouraging good behaviour and promised things like a movie night with popcorn, hot chocolate with marshmallows, permission to stay up longer or play games.

It hurts to be called names, and to feel like you don't measure up to a certain standard.. the list goes on and on."

“Listen, if you’re scared, everything becomes more exaggerated. So I’m going to tell you my story. (Mari) might say I’m lying, but this is what happened to me personally.”
 The plot involves tears, recriminations, and a shark sighting.
 “I like to be able to see what’s about to happen to me. So we went paddle boarding next to the house. That was all fine. It was beautiful. It was a beautiful day. I saw starfish.

You’re going to have to tell mom how I died in the Turks and Caicos.”
