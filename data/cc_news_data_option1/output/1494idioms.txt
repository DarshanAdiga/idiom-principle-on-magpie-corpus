Cricket Ireland has said that their limited-overs fixtures against New Zealand and Pakistan at home are at high risk of being postponed in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic that continues to spread all over the world. Earlier, the three-match ODI series and subsequent four Twenty20Is between Ireland and Bangladesh were postponed due to COVID-19, thus pushing the Irish season back to the end of May. However, Warren Deutrom, the Chief Executive of Cricket Ireland, now hinted that the upcoming series against New Zealand and Pakistan in June-July are likely to get postponed if the government s restrictions be in place. “We’re all going to have to take a pragmatic approach - we just don’t know what’s going to happen even if sport does get back up and running in June. With regards to international cricket, we remain in a wait-and-see holding pattern. Clearly, there is a high risk that our men’s home series against New Zealand and Pakistan - scheduled for June and July respectively - may be postponed if Government restrictions remain in place, the Cricket Ireland quoted Deutrom as saying. Deutrom also admitted that there would be a lot of challenges in front of Cricket Ireland for completing the scheduled bilateral home series. Of course, some of the challenges we face in trying to bring some degree of certainty are no different to any other sport with international opposition – for example, attaining visas for visiting teams and their support staff may not be possible as the Department of Foreign Affairs and the UK Foreign Office are currently not processing visa applications. In addition, each country will take the advice of their home government, so teams may not even be in a position to travel to Europe. More specific to our situation, both New Zealand and Pakistan are visiting multiple countries on their tours, so that adds an extra layer of complexit, Deutrom added. The Cricket Ireland Chief Executive also informed that the senior women s cricket team s tour to Thailand has already been postponed,while they are in constant in touch with the International Cricket Council (ICC) in relation to the 50-over World Cup qualifiers slated to take place in July. “For our senior women’s team, we have already had to postpone a tour to Thailand, and we are maintaining contact with ICC in relation to the 50-over World Cup Qualifier scheduled for July. We should know more shortly – and, of course, if the tournament somehow did proceed then we would have to look at warm-up or preparation matches. Where, when, against whom – these are still great unknowns for us, he added. Ireland are scheduled to play three ODIs and as many T20Is against New Zealand from June 19 while the Irish side are set to take on Pakistan in the two-match T20I series in July.

The Bihar School Examination Board (BSEB) is likely to announce matriculation results in the first or second week of May. BSEB chairman Anand Kishor, said, "The board will announce the matric results soon after the lockdown is over. We may require three-four days to wind up the evaluation process, as almost 75% work is done." "If the lockdown is not extended further, the board may declare results by May 10 or so," added Kishor.Earlier, the board had planned to declare matriculation result on March 30 but could not meet the target due to coronavirus outbreak.Fate of the students hanged in a balance after the state board suspended evaluation of the answer-sheets third time on Wednesday and extended the status quo till May 3. "Marks feeding on software was done parallel with copy checking before announcement of nationwide lockdown," said an official.However, the BSEB chairman refrained from stipulating any final date for results, stating that the board would notify once evaluation work was complete and physical verification of toppers' copies and their interviews through video call by experts were accomplished.The BSEB examination controller on Wednesday issued a letter to all district education officers for suspension of the evaluation process with effect from April 15 till May 3 to ensure rigorous adherence to the lockdown regime.More than 20,000 teachers were deployed for assessment of matriculation answer-sheets across 100 evaluation centres in the state.The examination and result process suffered this year in comparison of last year as lakhs of contractual teachers went on indefinite strike boycotting invigilation and evaluation duty. Coronavirus triggered lockdown is yet another challenge before the board to complete evaluation work.More than 15 lakh students appeared in matriculation exam held across 1368 exam centres, which was conducted from February 17 to February 24. Last year, matric results were declared on April 6 with overall pass percentage 80.73%.BSEB declared result of intermediate examination on March 24.

Goldman Sachs has downgraded its stance on the Indian market to 'marketweight' from 'overweight' citing "delayed recovery and extended valuations." Asia's economic growth this year will grind to a halt for the first time in 60 years, as the coronavirus crisis takes an "unprecedented" toll on the region's service sector and major export destinations, the International Monetary Fund said. The Centre, on Thursday, allowed health and motor third party policyholders to defer their renewal, if it falls between March 25 and May 3-- the lockdown period. Meanwhile, Rahul Gandhi said on Thursday that the nation- wide lockdown is only a "pause button" against the coronavirus pandemic and the government must aggressively test people to contain the disease. Here are the top events of the day that made the headlines.

BEIJING (AP) — Global stocks were mixed Thursday after unexpectedly weak U.S. retail and other data added to gloom about the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.Frankfurt and Shanghai gained while Tokyo and Hong Kong declined. London was little-changed.The future for Wall Street's S&amp;P 500 index edged up a day after the benchmark fell 2.2% on news U.S. retail sales and factory output plunged in March. The retail figures hit especially hard because consumer spending is two-thirds of the U.S. economy.The announcements shook investors who economists have warned are too optimistic about a quick rebound from what is shaping up to be the deepest global slump since the Great Depression of the 1930s."Boy, were U.S. data a rude awakening," said Riki Ogawa of Mizuho Bank in a report.Any notion of a "V-shaped recovery" once anti-virus controls are lifted "is now being questioned more seriously," Ogawa said.In early trading, London's FTSE 100 gained 1 point to 5,598.74 and Frankfurt's DAX rose 1.3% to 10,410.75. The CAC 40 in Paris added 1.1% to 4,402.91.On Wall Street, the future for the S&amp;P 500 index the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.4%.On Wednesday, the Dow fell 1.9% and the Nasdaq lost 1.4%.In Asia, Tokyo's Nikkei 225 fell 1.3% to 19,290.20 and the Hang Seng in Hong Kong lost 0.6% to 24,006.45. Sydney's S&amp;P-ASX 200 lost 1.3% to 5,397.60.The Shanghai Composite Index gained 0.3% to 2,819.94. Seoul's Kospi ended unchanged at 1,857.07 after swinging between gains and losses.India's Sensex gained 1.1% to 30,716.93. New Zealand's main index added 0.6% while Singapore gained and Thailand and Jakarta retreated.The U.S. retail sales decline exceeded the previous record decline of 3.9% during the Great Recession in November 2008. Auto sales dropped 25.6%, while clothing store sales plunged 50.5%. Restaurants and bars reported a nearly 27% fall in revenue.Spending may be falling at an even faster pace than retail figures suggest. Those data don't include spending on services such as hotel stays, airline tickets or movie theaters, industries that have been largely shut down by anti-virus controls.Also Wednesday, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York said its gauge for manufacturing in New York state fell by its biggest monthly margin in April. The index is at its lowest level on record.Traders say stocks will be volatile until investors can see more clearly when countries might be able to stop the outbreak.Energy stocks took the sharpest losses after oil prices touched another 18-year low.Global oil demand will fall this year by a record amount, the International Energy Agency said Wednesday. Benchmark U.S. crude gained 39 cents to $20.26 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. On Wednesday, the contract touched its lowest price since 2002 before recovering to $19.87. Brent crude, used to price international oils, advanced 58 cents to $28.28 per barrel in London. It fell $1.91, or 6.5%, the previous session to $27.69.Investors are focusing on how and when authorities may begin to ease business shutdowns and limits on people's movements. President Donald Trump has been discussing how to roll back federal social distancing recommendations. U.S. governors are collaborating on plans to reopen their economies in what is likely to be a gradual process to prevent the coronavirus from rebounding.China has reopened factories, shops and other businesses after declaring victory over the outbreak, but forecasters say it will take months for industries to return to normal output, while exporters will face depressed global demand.With millions of job losses worldwide, "the more lasting damage to confidence and labor market shocks is also being under-estimated, and these may not recover in tandem with the pandemic," said Mizuho's Ogawa.The dollar advanced to 107.72 Japanese yen from Wednesday’s 107.43 yen. The euro fell to $1.0889 from $1.0911.Copyright 2020 Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Murray Boulevard, which is also immediately across from the West Ashley High School. The complex will have 340 units and span of 14 acres, and city officials say this will make it one of the largest in West Ashley. DHEC is taking public comments through Tuesday as they review the wetlands permitting for the project. Click here to submit your comments or concerns. The city says although there are still a couple more votes to make before the complete approval of the project, no further comment will be taken for the city because all meetings are now done through the Zoom platform.After approval from DHEC, city officials say the owners of the property will work their way through technical reviews, including transportation and storm water concerns. But the city says no more board hearings are necessary with this project, and, for the most part, the project is nearly approved.The next time city council sees the project will be at a Technical Review Committee meeting, which they expect will be in a few weeks.The public is welcome to view the virtual TRC meetings, but no public comment will be taken.

NEW ORLEANS, La. (WVUE) - Local food banks are seeking donations as the Coronavirus outbreak has led to a surge in demand for basic necessities. Jay Vise with Second Harvest says over the last few weeks he’s seen the overall need for food as well as the need for volunteers increase dramatically. He says the food bank needs volunteers, food and cash donations as their kitchens are now working around the clock. “We’re having to buy more food than we ever have in our 40 year history. We’re trying to buy hundreds of thousands of pounds of food because so much of our usual supply chains that we get donations from, our retail partners, that’s dried up,” says Vise. “We added another shift, so we’ll be able to churn out more than 10,000 meals a day with volunteers and the help of the National Guard.”If you would like to help, visit NoHunger.org. If you are in need of food, Second Harvest Food Bank will have a distribution center open Thursday. Those in need can visit the parking lot near the old Zephyr Field in Metairie from 1 p.m. until 3 p.m. where volunteers will load your vehicle for you. Pick up will be available on Mondays and Thursdays. Copyright 2020 WVUE. All rights reserved.
