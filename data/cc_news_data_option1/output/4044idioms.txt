Qaw'mane Wilson was arrested just before Christmas of 2013 in connection with his mother's death. And soon, he was denied a bond because of the heinous nature of his crimes and his actions afterward. Therefore, he was held behind bars until his case went to court more than five years later, in early 2019. During his trial, the prosecutors painted the picture of how Qaw'mane was so eager for fame and fortune that he didn't even mourn his mother before he started spending her money. They also pinpointed his YouTube videos where he could be seen "giving back" to his fans and community, along with showcasing his pumped-up ride and expensive wardrobe.

BRUSSELS (AP) — The European Union finally sees progress in trade talks with the United Kingdom, but insists a momentary change in mood between the oft-bickering sides is no guarantee that an agreement will be delivered on time, officials said Thursday. Both sides are negotiating against the clock to get a basic trade deal delivered by the end of the month so that it can be approved by legislators in time to meet an end-of-year deadline with a transition period in the wake of Britain's departure from the bloc. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants a deal already by the time the EU leaders hold a summit next Thursday while the bloc's nations feel there is time until early November. “I would say that the mood appears to have changed,\" Irish Prime Minister Micheal Martin said when he hosted European Council President Charles Michel. “But the mood is one thing. It does need substance to follow the mood,\" he added, urging the negotiators meeting in London this week to speed up progress. Michel acknowledged time was running out on a potential agreement that could save hundreds of thousands of jobs on both sides of the English Channel. “The coming days are crucial. This is the moment of truth,\" Michel said. In diplomatic delegations in Brussels where member states eagerly follow the talks EU negotiator Michel Barnier has with his counterpart David Frost, there is the same sense of change in the air. But they also acknowledged that on the three main sticking points — a deal that UK companies won't seek to undercut their EU counterparts with low-standard products and excessive state aid, rights of EU fisherman to British waters and the governance overseeing the agreement — the sides have barely moved. “We need significant steps to be made by our British...

ATLANTA -- With the start of early voting less than a week away and a software update being installed to address a glitch in Georgia's voting machines, a federal judge was still considering a request by voting integrity activists to sideline the new touchscreen voting machines in favor of hand-marked paper ballots for the November general election.
   
 U.S. District Judge Amy Totenberg is presiding over a long-running lawsuit challenging the election system the state bought last year from Dominion Voting Systems for more than $100 million. The activists argue the system places an unconstitutional burden on the right to vote because voters cannot be confident their votes are accurately counted. A bug in the touchscreen machines and a hasty software update underscore that the machines aren't ready for use, they say.
   
 State officials have countered that Georgia has made significant improvements in recent years to update and secure election infrastructure. They have urged Totenberg not to order any changes so close to the election, saying they would be extremely costly and difficult to implement in time. The new problem was identified through testing meant to catch such issues and was quickly addressed, they say.
   
 The three-week in-person early voting period is set to begin Monday, and Election Day is less than four weeks away.
   
 Totenberg said she had been ready to issue a ruling on Sept. 28 until the activists raised new concerns about the voting machines in a Friday night court filing three days earlier.
   
 During preelection testing, county election officials discovered a problem with the display for a high-profile, 21-candidate U.S. Senate race. Under certain circumstances, not all of the candidates' names fit on a single screen.
   
 Lawyers for the state told the judge during an emergency teleconference Sept. 28 that it was a "very minor issue" that could be addressed with a software change.
   
 Lawyers for the activists raised concerns about the severity of the problem and the security of a last-minute fix.
   
 Dominion submitted the fix to a third-party laboratory, Pro V&V;, for evaluation. A report from Pro V&V; says the problem is not found in the new version of the software and the change was minor.
   
 The election integrity activists submitted declarations from two computer science experts who reviewed the Pro V&V; report. They said the evaluation was insufficient to verify the cause of the problem and the effectiveness of the solution.
   
 The experts also said the report indicates multiple changes to the source code, meaning there's a greater likelihood of unintended side effects and opening the door for hackers.
   
 The safeguards and testing outlined by the state to mitigate those risks are inadequate, the experts said.
   
 The process of updating the software requires completely replacing the core of the Dominion software on every voting machine, one of the experts, University of Michigan computer science professor J. Alex Halderman, testified last week according to a transcript of the closed-door hearing unsealed Monday.
   
 "(T)his is not a typical procedure to be going through," he said. "In an emergency, perhaps you would need to. But even then, it would be an extremely risky thing to be doing both from a correctness standpoint and from a security standpoint."
   
 Totenberg had asked the state to provide her with the Pro V&V; report and any documents about the change submitted to the U.S. Election Assistance Commission, which sets voluntary guidelines for election management and certification.
   
 The EAC was reviewing the request from Dominion after receiving it Tuesday, according to Ben Hovland, commission chairman. Dominion had previously submitted the change to a lab certified by the commission, which should help expedite the review, he said.
   
 But the update was distributed to county election officials last week with instructions to install it on their machines.
   
 Kevin Skoglund, another of the activists' experts, told the judge the EAC certification of a voting system would be voided if the change was made without the commission's prior written approval.
   
 Georgia law says the voting voting machines "shall be certified by the United States Election Assistance Commission prior to purchase, lease, or acquisition."
   
 The update was certified by the secretary of state after "thorough testing and validation" by Dominion, Pro V&V; and the secretary of state's office, Deputy Secretary of State Jordan Fuchs said.
   
 "Georgia law was expressly written to not require continued EAC certification for updates, but to only require it for the initial purchase of the system," she said.
   
 Marilyn Marks, executive director for the Coalition for Good Governance, a plaintiff in the suit, rejected that.
   
 "This is like saying that school buses need good tires when purchased but the tires can be replaced with bald tires as soon as they leave the factory," she said.

With a victory against the New York Yankees on Thursday night, the Tampa Bay Rays will advance to their first American League Championship Series since 2008 -- or, the same year they reached the World Series. Before the Rays can concern themselves with securing the second pennant in franchise history, they'll have to notch another win against the Yankees. If the Rays are to punch their ticket on Thursday, they'll do so behind a most unexpected starter: Ryan Thompson, a 28-year-old rookie right-hander, is expected to get the nod as an opener.
 Thompson's name is unlikely to register with many outside of the Tampa Bay region, and for good reason. This is his second season with the Rays organization, having joined the club through the Rule 5 draft's less- publicized minor-league phase in the winter of 2018. Thompson, who was recovering from Tommy John surgery at the time, was the 18th pick in the Triple-A section, and one of four Tampa Bay selections overall. He spent last season primarily in Double-A, where he was nearly three years older than his average competition.
 The Rays liked what they saw from Thompson, and he made their Opening Day roster this summer. In 25 appearances (one open) he posted a 4.44 ERA and a 2.88 strikeout-to-walk ratio. Those marks aren't impressive, but Thompson is more interesting than they suggest. To wit, let's highlight three things to know about him and what the Yankees can expect Thursday night.
 ## 1\. Thompson has an extreme release point
 Tampa Bay has collected pitchers with oddball approach angles, either horizontally or vertically, over the last several years. In that regard, Thompson is a fit. He's a true sidearmer who releases the ball close to his beltline. If that didn't create enough havoc for right-handed batters, he also stands on the extreme third-base side of the rubber.

After three years on the shelf, this mild-mannered comedy emerges with not nearly enough reason to get anyone back into a theater. Oakes Fegley plays Peter, a 12-year-old facing the stress of starting middle school at the same time that his mother (Uma Thurman) brings Peter’s widowed grandfather Ed (Robert DeNiro) to moves in and take over what had been Peter’s bedroom. What ensues is an escalating battle of slapstick pranks between Peter and Ed, in a story that’s ultimately rather sweet about how much time family members waste on minor squabbles that divide them rather than on the things that connect them. There’s just not nearly enough actual entertainment value, aside from a not to _Godfather Part II_ , in the silly stuff on the way to that moral; the brief asides involving Ed’s friendship with fellow seniors played by Christopher Walken and Cheech Marin suggests a story that would have been a lot more fun. It’s a harmless enough diversion, assuming you’re okay spending your family-friendly comedies counting how many times DeNiro’s character ends up either flat on his ass or exposing himself to his son-in-law. _Available Oct. 9 in theaters._ (PG)

Human rights organisation Walk Free has been collating data on the various forms of enslavement around the globe, including an estimated 500,000 unpaid domestic servants in Lebanon and barely paid migrant labour in the food industry – including in Australia – since 2013.At garment- manufacturing sweat shops in Bangladesh, orders were cancelled or discounts were demanded as the health crisis took hold, and it was the impoverished workers who suffered “rather than the multinationals sitting comfortably in offices around Australia”, Walk Free co-founder Grace Forrest said. “The COVID-19 situation has almost doubled the situation of exploitation and violence, and we see migrant workers have been even further pushed into the shadows,” Ms Forrest told NCA NewsWire. The group’s latest report Stacked Odds shows the pandemic has caused many more vulnerable females to become subjugated.Many girls who were pulled out of school due to coronavirus have been forced into marriage, with their desperate parents believing it will give them some financial security.Refugees have long been particularly vulnerable to the practice, which Ms Forrest witnessed herself at a camp at the Syrian border in 2016.“What I came across there … was mothers who felt the only option was to marry their daughters off to keep them safe within the camp,” she said.“It was either your child is vulnerable every day to sexual exploitation and rape in the camp or you marry her off and then she just has one predator rather than multiple.“These mothers absolutely understood that these were horrifying options … they were looking at the least worst one.” Almost 70 per cent of the world’s countries – 136 out of almost 200 nations – still fail to legislate against forced and child marriage, which is “not good enough”, Ms Forrest says.“This is about blowing the lid off the fact that slavery is not a problem of the past – it exists today,” she said.“The clothes that we buy in Australia, even in embassies in Canberra we’ve had instances of slavery.“It’s here on our shores, it’s here in our supply chain.“We need to vote for leaders who are going to prioritise this issue. “We need to tell leaders we care about it, and equally, we need to vote with our dollars and tell businesses we care about this because nothing is more scary to a boardroom than a bottom line and a mass consumer movement to say ‘we will not accept exploitation’.“It’s about keeping the pressure up.” Ms Forrest will present the report to the UN Security Council on Friday.

Now we want to bring in ABC's Alex for Shea who is following the vice president on the trail today Allen's good morning how is the campaign reacting. To this change by the commission but also the president's decision to opt out of his virtual. Diane good morning CU is shortly after that Fox Business interview where the president said he didn't think. That debate virtual debate was going to be worth his time for the campaign released a statement I wanna read a portion of it to you. President trump won the first debate despite a terrible and buys moderator Chris Wallace and everybody knows it that statement goes on this day. That the presidential debate commission to now rushed to Joseph Biden's distance to buy unilaterally canceling an in person debate is pathetic. Minutes says that the president trump president trump we'll have tested and multiple negative tests prior to the debate so there is no need for this unilateral declaration. Looked as Mary Alice pointed out earlier in the show. The debate is a week from today the president still has co bid so there is no guarantee that he will have tested negative. Multiple times before that debate but they are clearly coming out hard. And died and and and kind of putting down this this virtual debate. And Alex is the president does opt out in this debate doesn't happen that could make last night's vice presidential debate. Even more important what are worse some of the positive standout moments you've got for pens and Harris last night. I think the vice president I mean he's certain his campaign certainly feels that they made their marks whatever comes to. The Supreme Court justice nominee Amy coney Barrett. I think for a couple of shares how when it comes to with the administration's response to corona virus I think in the thought that she was very strong on that and also some of the racial reckoning that we're seeing across the country whenever it comes to. The police involved killings of George Floyd and Rihanna Taylor she had some critical moments there. But it look I mean if it is that going to move the needle here. It's time will tell but not quite sure I think you know a lot of the reflections from last night's debate on what the candidates actually didn't say. And added I'm not know there were quite a few questions that made just some more obviously than others. Either any big weak spots you think were highlighted last night that might require some damage control going forward. But what's interesting is it that Tom is so listener to come here is a question about pat. Packing the courts didn't come from Susan Page it came from vice president paints and so mean that kind of signifies that this is something that's. The vice president it's something that the trump campaign has had his head is as pinpointed. As a pressure point for this biting campaign to answer and then certainly she prohibited from that question. And at the end of her response the vice president said let the record show the ship and answered. And maybe it's something that's president trouble question Joseph Biden at at the next debate I would expect that to kind of continue and then before the vice president is actually do. Pretty interesting that he was asked about. If Roe vs. Wade was overturned. How he would or would you be in favor of certain state abortion laws and is home seeded Indiana. And this is something that the vice president is record on is it's pretty well documented but instead of taking eight victory lap. Keep committed. And so mean that some these kind of speaks to the strums campaign Tom warning two quart woman voters suburban women voters in knowing. That that's something that they need to kind of sure of going into the last the last few weeks of this election right now experts say keep it an interesting thanks.

PM Pashinyan - If we take into account the information starting from early this morning, we can say that the tactical maneuvers of the commanders of Karabakh has been a success. They made some tactical moves in the south, gave a corridor and caught an entire Azerbaijani corps into a trap. Literally just at this moment that corps is receiving crushing blows. And I think this will be the key point in the entire operation. According to the information I have, at the moment the real basis for the victory of Karabakh's army is being set.

The syringes were a clear danger to public health, but that was just part of the mess, with the city clearing about 34 tons of debris, Wessing said.
 “It’s something we had never seen before,’’ he said.
 With such large encampments, Raine said, there are likely hundreds of homeless still living in the streets.
 “I have to step back and focus on the ones I have right now,’’ who appreciate the assistance and are working hard to improve, Raine said. “COVID was a curse and a blessing. But for COVID, this would not have happened.’’
 He said Mesa noticed the need for an emergency housing program through its highly successful Community Court program.
 That program arranges for defendants to receive help from social service providers as an alternative to jail for repeated minor infractions that typically stem from homelessness.
 These petty crimes included trespassing, urinating in public and shoplifting. The program was recently revived under new City Magistrate John Tatz, using a digital platform, with defendants making court appearances from the hotel.
 Before Off the Streets, homeless people were graduating from the program after receiving counseling and treatment, but some of them still were homeless because no affordable housing was available.
 But the reality is that Mesa never would have had enough money to finance the Off-the-Streets program without the federal aid, Raine said.
 Authorities consider the homeless a potential hotspot for COVID-19 and believe that getting them a roof over their heads will reduce virus spread through better sanitation and social distancing.
 “Our goal is to create a permanent path to health and housing,’’ Lewis said. “It helps our enforcement of urban camping. We have to offer a bed’’ as an alternative to arrest.
 The homeless can stay in the hotel for a maximum eight weeks before they are assigned to the East Valley Men’s Shelter or some other facility for three to six months. The next step would be vouchers for Section 8 subsidized housing until they can support themselves without the subsidizes, Lewis said.
 While most Mesa city council members seemed happy with the program, the issue again demonstrated the political divide between members.
 Downtown Councilwoman Jen Duff said she supported a homeless campus while northeast Mesa council member Dave Luna supported continuing the present program.
 But southeast Mesa council member Kevin Thompson opposed taking on homelessness alone without a regional commitment from other cities.
 “The homeless rates are growing and they are expected to grow more,’’ Duff said, adding that it is not possible for someone making the minimum wage to afford renting an apartment and that more affordable housing is needed.
 “Many of our homeless are employed. They just can’t make ends meet,’’ she said.
 But Thompson said, “I don’t want Mesa to be the next Los Angeles or Portland. You can only be so compassionate to the homeless. At some point, it becomes unsustainable to our city budget.’’
 City Manager Chris Brady said he opposes buying a hotel, citing the maintenance and operation costs. Brady and Lewis said they are happy with the motel rental agreement.
 Mayor John Giles said he wants to see a stronger focus on education and workforce development.
 “It seems to me we should have zero tolerance for urban camping. We have a bed for you, but we also have rules,’’ Giles said.

Donald Lee Hatcher A shining, vibrant example of the Greatest Generation and a Marine veteran of WWll, Donald Lee Hatcher died suddenly "still standing" at the age of 98 on Sunday, October 4, 2020. Don is survived by his loving wife of 74 years, Mary Louise Hatcher, his children Paula (Bill) Cordes, Jan Hatcher, Steve (Kiki) Hatcher. He was preceded in death by cherished son, Bruce (Kip) Hatcher. He also leaves his beloved grandchildren Ryan Keiser, Steve Wolterman, Jess Jackson, Katy Cordes Byrne, William Cordes, Andrew Hatcher, Jaimie Steinher, Sarah Hatcher, Sam Steinher, Nathan Hatcher and 12 beautiful great grandchildren. Born Dec. 2, 1921, Don was only 3 years old when his father died leaving behind Don, his younger sister and widowed mother. He became a self-made man who navigated life with skills and values he adopted while honing a work ethic during childhood. He earned the best paper route and worked countless jobs to aid his mother and sister and pay for the college degree OSU awarded him shortly after he enlisted in the United States Marine Corps during his senior year. Don earned the rank of Captain after following the first offensive on Iwo Jima and serving on Guam. Following the war, a friend fixed Don up on a blind date with a sorority sister, Mary Louise Nagle, who was forever after the love of his life. They married 3 months later, raised 4 children, and celebrated 74 years of married life. Don grew a successful business and formed his own company, Hatcher Store Design, in 1969. He retained customers throughout the years, designing his last major pharmacy while in his late 80s. Don and Mary shared a love of golf and bridge and decades of enjoyment at Coldstream Country Club and during their annual trips to HIlton Head and Vero Beach. Don took pride in his 4 hole-in-ones, the last one occurring in his 70s. Don loved God, his family, his country, Mary's wonderful cooking, fishing, books, weekend trips to visit relatives, popcorn, and teaching his children 'killer' games of ping pong, pool, shuffle board, and gin rummy. He was a faithful servant and member of Anderson Hills United Methodist Church where he attended Bible study and worked as a member of the men's ARM; he also was an usher and greeter, toiled in the soil of the church garden, and in retirement, volunteered weekly to pick up any trash on the church grounds. Don was staunchly himself with ready advice, an incredible work ethic he passed on, a positive outlook, and a fierce independence that remained until his last moment on earth. A memorial service is planned for a later date.

In a brief hearing Tuesday, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Janet Baer urged both sides to work together on a new plan — even as the investigation of Gauri’s alleged wrongdoing continues.
 “Unfortunately, this case started out with principals that clearly don’t trust each other,” Baer said. The judge set a status hearing for Oct. 21.
 Gauri’s attorney on the bankruptcy case, Scott Clar, declined to comment Thursday.
 Gauri and Black Dog have been under fire since they were each named in federal search warrants and subpoenas filed in September 2019 in a sweeping political corruption investigation of former state Sen. Martin Sandoval and a number of suburban mayors and industry heavyweights, including Illinois' so-called Asphalt King, Michael Vondra.
 Gauri, 40, has not been criminally charged. Another lawyer representing him as the government conducts that probe, Daniel Collins, could not immediately be reached for comment.
 Last year, the Tribune reported on Gauri’s rise in the city’s business scene, from the hundreds of thousands of dollars in campaign cash he’s showered on local politicians to the relationships he’s forged with several key players in the sprawling federal investigation.
 Another controversy ignited earlier this year when a Florida fuel distributor that lost a bid for a $43 million contract to provide diesel to the city of Chicago filed an official protest alleging the process was skewed to take care of Gauri, who had the backing of an influential Chicago alderman. The protest was eventually denied.
 But it’s Black Dog’s filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in October 2019 that could pose the most legal jeopardy for Gauri.

WHEN Kevin Cullinane is asked how many children he and his wife Mairead have, his reply is that they’ve had three. It isn’t an easy question to answer but he feels he would be disloyal to his daughter Julia to respond otherwise. “Depending on the circumstances, I may expand on that,” he says. “But I’ll always acknowledge we had three children.”
 Julia, Kevin and Mairead’s second child, was born in Cork University Maternity Hospital (CUMH) in May 2015. On the third day of her short life, she was airlifted to London’s Great Ormond Street Hospital. She had been diagnosed with a very rare genetic disorder, alveolar capillary dysplasia, which caused a misalignment of capillaries in her lungs.
 A consultant told Kevin and Mairead that Julia was the sickest baby in CUMH.
 Her parents left Cork with an overnight bag, expecting to be away for three days. Instead, they were in London for three weeks.
 It was in London where their son James got to meet his baby sister for the first time when his grandmother and aunt brought him from Cobh, and it was in London where Kevin and Mairead had to make the heartbreaking decision to turn off Julia’s life support system when she was just over three weeks old.
 Throughout this devastating time, Kevin says they always felt that Julia was a patient of CUMH, thanks to the tremendous support they received from the staff there.
 “While we got world-class care in Great Ormond Street, when it came to the palliative care in Julia’s final days, the one thing we missed was the warmth of our own kith and kin around us. Staff who could relate to us as Corkonians and Irish people,” he says. “I don’t mean that in any disparaging way, but I suppose there’s a comfort you get from being among your own people, whether that’s your family, your friends, and also staff who have been with you through this whole journey of pregnancy.”
 This care continued when they returned home. CUMH staff attended Julia’s funeral mass at St Coleman’s Cathedral in Cobh. “It was another hugely appreciated gesture of the care we received from the phenomenal team there,” says Kevin.
 NEVER FORGOTTEN
 The couple soon learned about CUMH’s annual service of remembrance for those who have experienced pregnancy or infant loss.
 They didn’t know what to expect when they went to the non-denominational service in October 2015, but he says that they got solace in the fact that there weren’t alone. “We went there as newly bereaved parents and have been going back each year and getting something different each year. As somebody said to me as we were dealing with our own grief, ‘grief isn’t something you get over, it’s something you go through’ and I think that’s so true. It changes, you learn to cope with it differently.”
 His one piece of advice for other parents trying to cope with loss is to find somebody that you can just talk to about how you’re feeling. “Obviously you’ll talk to your spouse or your partner, but grief is different for everyone.
 “Opportunities to share that grief communally, like the CUMH service, are to me important because at least you appreciate you’re not alone.”
 Family members and siblings are also welcome at the service, and Kevin says that “you might assume someone elderly is remembering a grandchild, but I’ve discovered people there remembering their own babies from many, many years ago when it wasn’t socially acceptable to remember the loss that you might have suffered in pregnancy.
 “For some people, a lot of that grief has been bottled up for years, it’s an opportunity for them to join with everyone else there to remember their baby’s life.”
 HIDDEN PAIN
 Even now, pregnancy loss and different types of perinatal deaths don’t always get a huge amount of discussion, says Dr Keelin O’Donoghue, consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist at CUMH. She and her team within the Pregnancy Loss Research Group are leading investigators in the area of pregnancy loss and perinatal death, which refers to the number of stillbirths and deaths in the first week of life. “We think it’s important to demonstrate that we care, that it matters and we don’t forget.”
 Dr O’Donoghue says it is part of the national standards for bereavement care following pregnancy loss or perinatal deaths that hospitals should have an annual service of remembrance and all parents, no matter what type of pregnancy loss they had, should be welcome to attend.
 “Pregnancy loss – from miscarriage to stillbirth to neonatal deaths, even termination of pregnancy due to foetal anomaly – is a very common complication of pregnancy but it’s not naturally part of the story. It doesn’t get talked about in antenatal classes, Public awareness is still really limited, we see that in a lot in our research. There are a lot of misperceptions about how common types of pregnancy loss are, what the risk factors are or the fact that it can happen in an otherwise normal pregnancy out of the blue.”
 She says there are around 350 perinatal deaths a year in Ireland. “Nobody counts the second-trimester miscarriages or the miscarriages. There are thousands, they are quite forgotten statistics.
 “There’s still a lot of silence and stigma associated with pregnancy loss and that means people are unprepared and that means it’s very shocking when it happens. It’s really important for us not only to look after people at that time but to continue to acknowledge and to look after people – the service is just one way that we do that.”
 ONLINE SERVICE
 This year, the service will be virtual because of the pandemic but Dr O’Donoghue says that it will still include some recognisable components, including prayers and candles, for those people who attend regularly. “We asked people to email us the name of their baby and a short message. The members of our pathology department wrote the messages that we hung on the tree during the filming of the service.”
 The service will be broadcast on Thursday, October 15, World Pregnancy and Infant Loss Remembrance Day – and Dr O’Donoghue says that they will encourage people to light a candle at home, to take a picture of it and put it up on social media in remembrance. “That’s something that people might take to or might not, everybody remembers in different ways.”
 For Kevin Cullinane, who is head of communications at Cork Airport, and his family, it’s really important that Julia’s memory is kept alive and that both her siblings grow up knowing they had a sister.

The unusual element to Ferguson’s approach was we were fishing Ned rigs — small, nondescript soft plastics on mushroom-shaped jig heads — instead of tubes or curly tails that most use. We were using jigs from Ferguson’s company (Provider Tackle) that he started 15 years ago when he was dissatisfied with what he found on the market.
 We did more of the same — drifted and dragged Ned Rigs on braided line and a fluorocarbon leader — for most of the morning and caught mostly smallmouths, though we did hit a pod of largemouths on one stretch with lots of weeds around it.
 We caught about a dozen and a half bass, mostly keepers, but no giants. It was slow compared to what many have come to expect on Lake St. Clair in recent years. And that’s partially because of COVID; with the Canadian border closed, everyone is fishing the American side, which is well less than half the lake. And fishing pressure has skyrocketed with so many folks home from work.
 “We used to have a lot of 50- to 80- fish days out here,” Ferguson said. “It doesn’t happen as often as it used to, but you’ve just got that many more people putting pressure on the fish. It’s still one of the best fisheries in the world, but in the early ‘90s, when the smallmouth population boomed and it wasn’t as well known, you could go out there and catch endless bass.
 “Now, the lake’s got a lot of pressure on a lot of areas where guys might have been heading to Canada. Now it’s harder to get away from the boat traffic.”
 Around noon, the wind settled enough that Ferguson thought we ought to poke our nose out into the lake. We fished for about an hour — me with a spinnerbait, Ferguson with a chatterbait — around weed beds in five to seven feet of water. We each caught one nice (three-pound-plus) smallmouth.
 Between the weather and the border issue, we didn’t get a really good view of what’s going on at Lake St. Clair. This summer, for instance, it took 86 pounds (for four days) Bassmaster tournament. But that’s only part of the story; when the tournament cut the field to 10 anglers for the last day, there were six guys with 60 pounds or better — a four-pound or better average —who did not make the cut.
 That doesn’t happen anywhere.
 Ferguson’s been busy this summer, but he has some openings in late fall – he leaves Michigan around Thanksgiving and guides in Florida in the winter – if you’re interested. You can reach him at 586-531-2821.

An Ark Valley Chisholm Trail Division III title is likely on the line Friday night when McPherson and Buhler renew their rivalry.
   
 Buhler has won three straight games after dropping their season opener at Goddard. All three Buhler wins have come against league opponents.
   
 "One of our goals every year is to win league," Buhler head coach Steve Warner said. "We're playing a good team, and a well-coached team. We'll have to be ready to go."
   
 McPherson, 2-0 in league, began the year 4-0 before last week's 41-35 loss to De Soto. The Bullpups hadn't been tested in their four wins, and head coach Jace Pavlovich believes his team will gain more from their loss than their four wins.
   
 "That game was one of the better experiences playing football in the regular season that we've had," Pavlovich said. "It really didn't even matter if we won or lost because we just wanted to play a good opponent. It was great to get that experience, and it will help Friday against Buhler."
   
 Both coaches believe Friday's game will be won in the trenches.
   
 "Their offensive line is very good, maybe the best we've seen this year," Warner said. "They're scoring a lot of points, and their defense is very solid and physical - it's the same kind of McPherson team that we've seen the last couple of years."
   
 The Crusaders have been running the ball extremely well behind their offensive line and running back Sam Elliott. In last week's 41-21 win against Augusta, Elliott rushed for 366 yards.
   
 "It starts with the offensive and defensive lines," Pavlovich said. "We'll need to be able to control the line of scrimmage on both sides of the ball. This is true in every game, but especially true against Buhler."
   
 Both sides agree that their players get a little extra juiced for a rivalry game like this.
   
 "This is a rivalry that's healthy for both sides," Pavlovich said. "We wake up in the morning in the summer ready to beat Buhler, and I know they do the same. People say there's hatred, but it's mutual respect for each other."
   
 Currently, McPherson has a three-game winning streak against Buhler. The last time the Crusaders beat the Bullpups was the 2016 season opener.
   
 "It doesn't matter how many times you've won or lost this game, every year the record resets to 0-0," Pavlovich said. "We're just excited to have the opportunity to play."
   
 Friday's game was originally scheduled to be played in Buhler. However, Buhler is not allowing spectators for athletic events at the moment, so both sides agreed to move the game to McPherson to allow limited spectators.
   
 "Both sides talked about it and we agreed it was very important to allow parents tow watch the game," Warner said. "It would be a shame to have to watch the game on stream, especially one of this caliber."

 The criminal complaint identified the six as Adam Fox, Ty Garbin, Kaleb Franks, Daniel Harris, Brandon Caserta, all of Michigan, and Barry Croft of Delaware.
 Fox said he needed 200 men to storm the Capitol building in Lansing and take hostages, including the governor, according to the FBI.
 He said he wanted to try Whitmer for “treason” and would execute the plan before the Nov. 3 election, the government said.
 Later, however, the group shifted to targeting the governor’s vacation home, the FBI said.

DETROIT (AP) — Six men plotted to try to kidnap Michigan Democratic Gov.

She has uncontrolled power right now. All good things must come to an end.”Authorities scheduled a Thursday afternoon news conference to talk about the case. The government used informants and undercover agents to thwart the alleged plot.The criminal complaint said the plan involved Whitmer and her second home in northern Michigan.Whitmer has been praised but also deeply criticized for the state’s response to the coronavirus.

ATLANTA -- Georgia lawmakers are looking at ways to boost the number of people who earn high-school and college degrees amid a changing labor market that is tending toward more automated technical jobs.
   
 More than 1 million Georgians could become "unemployable" in the coming years due to a shift toward technology-driven jobs that people with lower levels of education cannot fill, according to Stephen Pruitt, president of the nonprofit Southern Regional Education Board.
   
 Without access to adult education, those less-educated Georgians could be left in the lurch by 2030, particularly as the COVID-19 pandemic has sped up automated and online-focused jobs, Pruitt told a Georgia Senate study committee Thursday.
   
 "The reality is we're going to have plenty of jobs," Pruitt said. "The question is whether we're going to have people to take those jobs."
   
 The Senate Educating Adult Students Study Committee met for the first and perhaps only time Thursday to look at programs aimed at expanding the educational experience and skills of adult Georgians to match them with more stable, higher paying jobs.
   
 The committee is tasked with drafting a report by December that may recommend changes to state education policies to better support adults in need of more learning and work-oriented credentials.
   
 Georgia already leans on its technical college system to educate and train thousands of adults in job skills and push them toward opportunities for college education, said the system's assistant commissioner for adult education, Cayanna Good.
   
 Last year, more than 32,000 adults took classes through the technical college system and earned more 6,000 high-school equivalency certificates, plus nearly 700 skills-based credentials, Good said.
   
 But Good said she also sees the writing on the wall for many low-skill, menial jobs that could fall by the wayside in the rise of automation.
   
 "Every single day I worry about my cashiers," Good said. "Those jobs are going to be automated. They're all going away."
   
 Some companies and programs are looking to fill the gap. The international thrift-store chain Goodwill has run free adult education schools in several states since 2010 and is now on the cusp of piloting two new schools in Macon and Savannah.
   
 On top of helping adult students complete courses they're missing to attain degrees, the schools run by Goodwill also aim to give people exiting prison a chance to increase their ability to be hired and maintain steady employment.
   
 "We're asking other employers to give them a chance so they can change their lives," said Al Stewart, business development director for Goodwill in Middle Georgia.
   
 Sen. Lester Jackson, D-Savannah, suggested the Senate committee may need to meet more than once before December to delve deeper into whether course credits for technical college classes and other programs like Goodwill's actually teach the skills needed to secure better employment.
   
 "Clearly, we need to serve a lot more Georgians than we're serving now," Jackson said.

MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) — Gov. Phil Scott allowed a bill passed by the Legislature overseeing the use of force by police to become law without his signature. The new law, most of which takes effect July 1, outlines when Vermont police can use force and deadly force, and it bans certain restraints, such as neck holds. The law also outlines the procedures that will be used to implement the new policies. In a message to the Legislature delivered Wednesday evening, the Republican governor said he shared the goals of the bill of strengthening the state’s use-of-force policies to protect citizens and law enforcement alike. \"I believe, by and large, our law enforcement officers and leaders are committed to the reform work necessary to achieve racial equity and helping to develop policies and training that ensure equal treatment, protection, and safety for all,\" Scott said in his letter to the secretary of the Senate, the body where the legislation originated. But he said that “2020 has reminded us that systemic racism is deeply rooted in our nation's institutions.” Meanwhile, the Vermont chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union said the new law “gives Vermont the best statewide police use of force standard in the nation and is a critical step towards reimagining the role of police in our communities.” Vermont ACLU Executive Director James Lyall said that people of color and those with mental health conditions are disproportionately affected by policing. \"Our continuing work to root out systemic racism in all its forms is far from over, but the enactment of (the new law) is an important step to making Vermont a place that is more just and equitable for everyone who calls this state home,” he said.

Donald Lee Hatcher      A shining, vibrant example of the Greatest Generation and a Marine veteran of WWll, Donald Lee Hatcher died suddenly "still standing" at the age of 98 on Sunday, October 4, 2020. Don is survived by his loving wife of 74 years, Mary Louise Hatcher, his children Paula (Bill) Cordes, Jan Hatcher, Steve (Kiki) Hatcher. He was preceded in death by cherished son, Bruce (Kip) Hatcher. He also leaves his beloved grandchildren Ryan Keiser, Steve Wolterman, Jess Jackson, Katy Cordes Byrne, William Cordes, Andrew Hatcher, Jaimie Steinher, Sarah Hatcher, Sam Steinher, Nathan Hatcher and 12 beautiful great grandchildren.      Born Dec. 2, 1921, Don was only 3 years old when his father died leaving behind Don, his younger sister and widowed mother. He became a self-made man who navigated life with skills and values he adopted while honing a work ethic during childhood. He earned the best paper route and worked countless jobs to aid his mother and sister and pay for the college degree OSU awarded him shortly after he enlisted in the United States Marine Corps during his senior year. Don earned the rank of Captain after following the first offensive on Iwo Jima and serving on Guam.      Following the war, a friend fixed Don up on a blind date with a sorority sister, Mary Louise Nagle, who was forever after the love of his life. They married 3 months later, raised 4 children, and celebrated 74 years of married life. Don grew a successful business and formed his own company, Hatcher Store Design, in 1969. He retained customers throughout the years, designing his last major pharmacy while in his late 80s.      Don and Mary shared a love of golf and bridge and decades of enjoyment at Coldstream Country Club and during their annual trips to HIlton Head and Vero Beach. Don took pride in his 4 hole-in-ones, the last one occurring in his 70s.      Don loved God, his family, his country, Mary's wonderful cooking, fishing, books, weekend trips to visit relatives, popcorn, and teaching his children 'killer' games of ping pong, pool, shuffle board, and gin rummy. He was a faithful servant and member of Anderson Hills United Methodist Church where he attended Bible study and worked as a member of the men's ARM; he also was an usher and greeter, toiled in the soil of the church garden, and in retirement, volunteered weekly to pick up any trash on the church grounds. Don was staunchly himself with ready advice, an incredible work ethic he passed on, a positive outlook, and a fierce independence that remained until his last moment on earth.      A memorial service is planned for a later date.

“He’s just a tank,” Balducci said, “I think he’s going to be unstoppable.”
 While Lucas is arguably the biggest threat on the defense, Balducci sees the entirety of the front seven and the pass rush being a huge key for success this season.
 “Being able to move together and understanding where we go,” Balducci said, “I think it’s going to be really great to see what this pass rush can do.”
 The Firebirds racked up a total of 29 sacks to go along with 93 tackles for a loss in 2019. Even after losing top defenders like Jaxon Richards and Christian Bower, it’s clear there has been no confidence lost in the defense.
 “We got playmakers all over the field,” Balducci said, “I’m looking at how well we can play together as a team.”
 Due to the delay, Chaparral is currently scheduled to play its first game against No. 5 Hamilton. The Firebirds dropped last season's matchup against the Huskies 44-21.Williams was one of the top performers in last season's matchup, after racking up 61 total yards and two scores on the ground. The Firebird defense was manhandled by the Hamilton run game to the tune of 285 rushing yards and four touchdowns. Chaparral will likely have its hands full again this season should the two teams meet.
 Above all else, the Firebirds are happy that they are able to play football at all this season given the impact regarding COVID-19 and its effects on the program. Even though it’s not a normal 10-game regular season schedule, it’s obvious that coach Barnes and his team are thankful to take the field at all this year.
 “Not knowing if we were going to have a season was really scary,” Williams said, “the point when we stepped onto the field and got back to the feeling of us being a team again was phenomenal.”
 While the season looks different, the expectation remains the same. After their 14 days in isolation, Chaparral will be tested immediately by some of the best the state of Arizona has to offer. The Firebirds still appear unfazed, and with one of the best offensive units in Arizona and a talented young defensive core, it’s clear that their no. 9 ranking was well deserved.
 “We obviously think we’re better than ninth,” Williams said, “we definitely got to show a lot of people what we’re made of.”

DETROIT (AP) — Six men were charged with plotting to kidnap Michigan Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer at her vacation home in reaction to what they viewed as her “uncontrolled power,” according to a criminal complaint unsealed Thursday in federal court.The men plotted for months, consulting and training with militia members, and undertaking rehearsals in August and September, according to the complaint. Four of the six men planned to meet Wednesday to “make a payment on explosives and exchange tactical gear,” the FBI said in the court filing. The FBI quoted one of the accused as saying Whitmer “has no checks and balances at all. She has uncontrolled power right now. All good things must come to an end.”The government used informants and undercover agents to thwart the alleged plot. The six men were arrested Wednesday night and each faces up to life in prison. U.S. attorney Andrew Birge called them “violent extremists.”“All of us in Michigan can disagree about politics, but those disagreements should never, ever amount to violence. Violence has been prevented today,” Detroit U.S. Attorney Matthew Schneider told reporters.The criminal complaint said the plan involved Whitmer and her second home in northern Michigan.Whitmer has been praised but also deeply criticized for the state’s response to the coronavirus. She put major restrictions on personal movement throughout the state and on the economy, although many of those limits have been lifted. The criminal complaint did not mention those orders. Through electronic communications, two of the alleged conspirators “agreed to unite others in their cause and take violent action against multiple state governments that they believe are violating the U.S. Constitution,” the FBI said.The criminal complaint identified the six as Adam Fox, Ty Garbin, Kaleb Franks, Daniel Harris, Brandon Caserta, all of Michigan, and Barry Croft of Delaware.Fox said he needed 200 men to storm the Capitol building in Lansing and take hostages, including the governor, according to the FBI.He said he wanted to try Whitmer for “treason” and would execute the plan before the Nov. 3 election, the government said.Later, however, the group shifted to targeting the governor’s vacation home, the FBI said.The government said the scheme appeared to have roots in a June gathering in Dublin, Ohio, attended by more than a dozen people from several states, including Croft and Fox.“The group talked about creating a society that followed the U.S. Bill of Rights and where they could be self-sufficient,” the FBI affidavit said. “They discussed different ways of achieving this goal from peaceful endeavors to violent actions. ...

“There were 39 bikes who made the qualified ladder with 30 of them kicking in an extra $325 to the GDB/KPM Sunday Side Pot. The total money in the side pot was $9750. Add that to the $4K NHDRO purse, and that made for $13,750 up for grabs for your $500 entry fee. That’s a pretty darn good amount of money to be racing for in 4.60. That is the largest purse I can recall in the class ever, in any sanction, since the inception of the class. So that right there is pretty badass. Granted it is also the largest entry fee ever, but still, there is something to be said for a $13,750 purse.”

We put a ring on it 💍👨🏽‍🤝‍👨🏻😍(it doesn’t fit, but I measured my own finger badly with a tape measure….not to be advised) 😂 I’m not sure I actually asked the question because I was basically crying so much. I didn’t have a plan B so I’m glad he said yes. The smiles on our faces say it all, AND Nik is speechless as he says he’s still processing (the first time ever I’m one step ahead of this guy😳). This moment is especially special because it seems so surreal. Growing up both Nik and I didn’t think we’d ever be able to legally and publicly celebrate our commitment❤️. We need to keep fighting for all those living in places where this isn’t possible or where there is hostility. Love wins ❤️ Clandestine design team: @r.beni.r and @veilaanne 😚 #ilovethisguy #hesaidyes💍

And to complicate matters even more, Gilmore got face to face with quarterback Patrick Mahomes on the field after their Week 4 matchup.

 "I have enrolled at college - since going through everything I went through it kind of gave me a new outlook on life.
 "It has been a rough ride especially with it constantly being on the news and social media - it is all I ever see, hear or read so I'm constantly reminded by what I've been through but I'm pretty positive in myself with the help of Sally, my counsellor.
