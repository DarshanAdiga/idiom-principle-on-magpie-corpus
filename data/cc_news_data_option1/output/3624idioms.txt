Bhubaneswar (Odisha) [India], September 11 (ANI): Ahead of the seventh edition of the Indian Super League (ISL), Odisha FC have signed Australian defender Jacob Tratt on a one-year deal on Friday.   The 26-year-old can play both at centre-back and right-back positions. After his youth career at Sydney FC, he has been consistently playing in the Australian A-League and has represented Sydney FC, Sydney United, Wellington Phoenix, Sutherland Sharks and Perth Glory.   "I am excited and grateful for this opportunity at Odisha FC. I am looking forward to work with coach Stuart Baxter in contributing to the success of the club in the upcoming season ahead," Tratt said in a statement.  
 Welcoming the defender to OFC, head coach Stuart Baxter said, "We are pleased to secure Jacob's signature. He is a physically strong player with good functional technique who can develop further. His attributes shall add to our defensive line and bolster our squad depth."   The seventh edition of the ISL will be staged completely in Goa due to the coronavirus pandemic. The season will start from November and it will be played behind closed doors at three venues - Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, Fatorda; GMC Athletic Stadium, Bambolim; and Tilak Maidan Stadium, Vasco.   Odisha FC will be playing all the home games of this season's ISL at the GMC Athletic Stadium in Bambolim, Goa. (ANI)

Some things weren’t meant to last forever, and one of those things is the bathroom facility at the Rice County Fairgrounds.


  “That’s the one thing people complain about the most,” John Dvorak, manager of the Rice County Fairgrounds, said of the bathroom facility. “When they come to the fair, they want to have a good experience, and one way to do that is to have more comfortable bathrooms.”


  Apart from being unpleasant, the outdated bathrooms are not handicap accessible and therefore miss the mark of Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requirements. During the coronavirus pandemic, the facilities also lack a proper setup for social distancing and fail to meet hygiene standards.


  The Rice County Commissioners also saw the need for new restrooms on the fairgrounds and approved an advertisement for bids during its Aug. 25 meeting. Parks and Facilities Director Matt Veridick made the request to the Rice County Board of Commissioners.


  Funding from the Coronavirus Relief, Aid and Economic Security (CARES) Act will be used for the project, which Dvorak expects to cost upward of $250,000. The bidding period began Sept. 1 and ends Sept. 22, giving contractors three weeks to compose their bids. Construction will begin soon after selection of the contractor, and the substantial completion date is Dec. 1.


  Although traces of asbestos found in the facility delayed the demolition, Dvorak said the bathrooms are ready to be torn down Monday.


  While he isn’t sure of the exact year the restrooms were built, Dvorak knows the initial structure functioned as a men’s restroom only. The women’s portion of the facility was added later.


  The current restroom has six stalls on either side, and the new restrooms will have the same footprint with six women’s stalls, three men’s toilets and three urinals. Both sides will contain three sinks and handicap stalls. Unlike the old restroom, the new building will have a unisex bathroom with a shower on the west end.


  To meet COVID-19 requirements, the modern bathrooms will have an entrance on one side of the building and an exit on the opposite end to prevent interactions. Automatic faucets and paper towel dispensers will reduce the number of surfaces users need to touch.


  Depending on the bids, Dvorak said the bathroom may include hand dryers instead of paper towels.


  The Rice County Fair is usually the only occasion when the bathrooms are open, said Dvorak, but he hopes the new restrooms draw more activities to the fairgrounds.While it was once an embarrassment to open up the bathrooms for functions, he said the new facility will be more inviting.


  “It’s been a long time coming, and I’m just grateful the county administrator and commissioners saw the need that it was time to replace it, and we’re able to use some of the funding coming from the CARES Act,” Dvorak said. “It can only help improve the fairgrounds.”

Our story – Working his way through college, our father started in the theater business in 1969 as an usher. He worked his way through the ranks to theater manager. He married our mom and together they began to build their business. They became partners in a small single screen theater in 1975. They slowly became experts in small town theaters, thriving with the mottos “small towns deserve state of the art theaters” and “our customers are our business”. They later had the good fortune of acquiring two more small town theaters and then in 1982 they ventured out “on their own” gaining full ownership of one of the three theaters. More years of hard work and determination brought about expansion. In 1997, they had a vision to bring a state of the art, family friendly theater to the small community of Paso Robles. With determination, creativity and heart, they opened the Park Cinemas with the movie Titanic. This was quite apropos, as this was, for them, a titanic risk.

The paper, which appears in the August 2020 issue of the journal published by Boston University Medical Center, was written by a group of male vascular surgeons who surveilled the social media accounts of young female vascular surgeons. Their "findings"? They labeled women--who did not give their permission to be studied--as unprofessional if they had posted photos of themselves in bikinis or in "provocative" Halloween costumes. "It went beyond appearance and even deemed doctors who advocated for gun control and for LGBTQ rights as unprofessional," Yasmin adds. "Really, it was their own particular definition of what was considered 'unprofessional,' and somehow it got published."
 Reaction to the study has been nothing short of viral. Women doctors around the world shared photos of themselves in swimsuits using the hashtag #MedBikini, in open revolt of the journal's sexist and restrictive view on what it means to be professional. One doctor who posted a #MedBikini photo is New York City-based dermatologist Dr. Dendy Engelman, who says she experienced sexism beginning in her residency when she was told she was "too pretty" to be a doctor by a senior physician. "I was pulled aside and told that my outfits were too provocative and was instructed to wear scrubs when everyone else got to wear normal clothes," Engelman says. She was also told to cut her hair short in order to "look the part."
 She has heard similar stories from friends in the field. "A colleague of mine who worked at a prestigious NYC hospital was told to wipe off her lipstick before making rounds with her team," Engelman says. "Another was reprimanded for showing too much skin in her headshot when only her forearms were exposed."

Colonists during the Revolutionary War often switched their allegiance, declaring themselves Patriots or Loyalists, depending on personal circumstances or which army controlled their town at the time, according to historian Donald F. Johnson in his forthcoming book, "Occupied America."
 National identity was still in flux after the war. It was often unclear who was actually a citizen. Sailors, in particular, were frequently challenged on their status because many looked and sounded indistinguishable from the British when at sea or in foreign ports, wrote Nathan Perl-Rosenthal in his 2015 book, "Citizen Sailors."
 One of the sailors I researched for my book, James L. Cathcart, regularly changed national allegiances to improve his fortunes. By my count, he switched identities or allegiances eight times by the time he turned 29, in 1796.
 Born in Ireland, Cathcart fought for both sides in the American Revolution. Then when captured by Algerian corsairs in 1785, he spent a decade in captivity wavering between calling himself British or American, depending upon which offered the best hope of ransom. During captivity in Algiers he was also made a senior bureaucrat, advising and representing the interests of the ruler of 18th-century Algiers.

For the past three decades, the famous movie characters known simply as “Bill and Ted” have endeared audiences with original and even newer fans of their sci-fi comedies. When a sequel was greenlit only two years after Stephen Herek’s  _Bill & Ted’s Excellent Adventure_ (1989), the follow-up could have very easily gone the way of most sequels to popular goofy comedies—that is, not good and incredibly unfunny. But instead of being redundant or lazy, Pete Hewitt’s  _Bill & Ted’s Bogus Journey_ (1991) went the opposite direction. Now, nearly 30 years later and a decade in the making, a third installment is upon us in the form of Dean Parisot’s  _Bill & Ted Face the Music_.

The Le Sueur-Henderson Giants girls tennis team keeps rolling, as it picked up two more home meet wins to remain undefeated on the season. The Tri-City United girls team has had a different story to their season thus far, but the team continues to improve.


  In a matchup between the two squads Sept. 10, Le Sueur-Henderson won 6-1, with the Titans only match win coming at No. 3 doubles. It was a good night for tennis, with temperatures in the mid-60s and little wind, and many of the Giants players hit the courts running.


  At No. 1, 2 and 3 singles respectively, Greta Nesbit, Chloe Brandt and Morgan Jones each won in straight sets, giving up a total of four games between the three matches. Nesbit won 6-0, 6-0 over Josie Plut, of TCU; Brandt won 6-1, 6-2 over Titan Monserrat Ruiz; and Jones defeated TCU’s Morgan Mueller 6-0, 6-1.


  “Greta, Chloe and Morgan all rolled through their singles matches,” Seaver said. “Controlled their shot choices, hitting with depth and placement.”


  Nesbit and Jones are both undefeated on the year. Nesbit, a senior, reached state as an individual last year. Jones, a junior, is palying her first full year in a singles spot. She was happy with her match against TCU.


  “I hit the corners well,” said Jones, noting it’s something she’s been working on with coach Seaver.


  She said it feels “really good” to be undefeated as an individual so far in the season, and regarding the team’s undefeated status, she said, “We’ve all been working hard, trying to do our best. I think we can go pretty far, if we have a postseason.” (There is still no determination as to whether Minnesota high school girls tennis section and state playoffs will take place in 2020.)


  At No. 4 singles, TCU’s Sami Tiede pushed Makenna Reinhardt hard in two sets, but the Giants senior came out on top with a 7-6, 6-4 win.


  “Sami was very competitive at No. 4 singles,” Titans coach Phil Murry said. “Pushing her to a tiebreaker in the first set.”


  A couple of the doubles matches were also closely contested. At No. 1 doubles, Anna Pavlo and Mia Schwarz, of LS-H, were able to withstand the challenge of Gabby Prochaska and Rachel Rynda, winning 7-5, 6-2.


  “No. 1 doubles started tentative but worked on better shot placement and net movement,” Seaver said of the LS-H duo. “Keeping the ball away from the net person.”


  For the Giants No. 2 doubles team of Darbi Dunning and Halle Bemmels, it was somewhat smoother sailing with a 6-3, 6-0 victory over TCU’s Emma Traenor and MacKenzie Holmbo.


  “No. 2 doubles took advantage of the other teams errors and played strong at the net,” Seaver said.


  The No. 3 doubles match between LS-H’s Bella Holloway and Ella Nesbit and TCU’s Allie Schley and Savannah Squires was the only three-set match on the day, with the Titans duo coming out on top 6-3, 4-6, 6-3.


  “I was really pleased with No. 3 doubles,” TCU’s Murry said. “Allie and Savannah really seamed to be in sync today. I thought they played very well together.”

I hate most of Donald Trump’s rhetoric about immigration and immigrants, but wouldn’t it be wild if it turned out to be more offensive to rich white liberals than to the actual targets of his diatribes?


  Meanwhile, the racists who tell me — usually in ALL CAPS — that importing brown people is suicidal and that’s why we must support Trump would, to borrow a phrase from that great Cuban American, Ricky Ricardo, “have some ’splaining to do.”


  And so would the progressive activists and politicians who think they can summarize the views and attitudes of a huge, and hugely diverse, group of human beings.


  Again, I wish Trump wouldn’t use racist rhetoric about immigration. But if Hispanics voted for him in large numbers despite that rhetoric and despite his immigration policies (or even because of them), it would deal a mortal wound to the claim that wanting to enforce immigration laws or making our immigration system slightly more restrictive is racist.


  Lastly, Hispanics themselves would benefit in the long run simply by virtue of the fact that both parties would now compete for their votes.


  I understand this is a hard argument to make with Trump in office for a lot of reasons, and I personally wish we were talking about a different Republican presidential candidate. And it’s not going to happen this time, anyway. But Trump’s relative success with Hispanics suggests it could happen someday, particularly with a Hispanic GOP nominee. And that’s something to hope for.

       China's top anti-corruption body, the CPC Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI), has sent an on-site supervision team to the Shenzhen Stock Exchange to safeguard registration-based reforms at the tech-heavy start-up ChiNext board, the CCDI said on Friday.      CCDI's on-site teams attach great importance to any potential corruption risks related to the reforms being carried out at the ChiNext board and will especially look for discrepancies that may impede the pace of reform, and incidents that may trigger systemic risks and insider trading conspired by officials in charge of listing and market players.      The CCDI said it had held one-on-one talks with over 20 officials and staff members from the Shenzhen Stock Exchange management, the ChiNext Board Listing Committee and the review center. These departments are in charge of offering and listing review under the registration-based IPO system, which plays a critical role in controlling the access to the capital market.      The CCDI said it had created a clean document for each of the 49 committee members of the listing committee and 98 officials and staff at the review center.      Analysts said that the anti-corruption watchdog's move could be linked with the recent market plunges and anomalies currently seen in the ChiNext board, with some experts pointing out that the root cause of the chaos could be insider trading, a criminal activity.      ChiNext board has plunged by more than 7 percent this week as of press time on Friday and many of the individual shares have seen much wider fluctuations due to the board's wider daily trading cap of 20 percent.      The trading of so-called junk shares is seen as the reason behind the market's plunge and some experts are saying this could be a plot by certain major players in the ChiNext board, and they might have tuned the timing of the boom and bust story to coincide with the rollout of the ChiNext reforms.      Junk shares are shares at ChiNext board that had been dumped by investors during the past year but in recent months saw their prices soar by multiple times led by bigger investors in the market, with at least 50 junk shares' prices doubling in value after the ChiNext reform. But those shares began to fall recently.      Dong Dengxin, director of the Finance and Securities Institute at the Wuhan University of Science and Technology, said there is certainly overspeculation in the market and the possibility of stock price manipulation cannot be ruled out.      Lü Pingbo, an influential stock market Weibo blogger in China, noted that overspeculation has a tendency to spread across the board and that the trading volume of the ChiNext board has exceeded that of the Shanghai Stock Exchange on Wednesday and the situation could be "out of control" for the ChiNext board.      "While the regulators can tolerate speculation or even overspeculation, they must crack down on stock price manipulation and insider trading to protect investors' interests," Dong told the Global Times on Friday.      Dong said the essence of the reform is in its inclusiveness and tolerance of tech start-ups to fail, while it is also expected to lead to tightened regulation and enhanced crackdown on criminal activity.

"Given the sudden ubiquity of the face mask in 2020, across the entire globe and in an increasing number of social contexts, it is impossible to avoid the conclusion that this is precisely the sort of development Junger had in mind. Our readiness to obscure the face reflects the dehumanising tendencies that, for Junger, underlie the modern period. It represents another stage in the degradation of the individual that became explicit in the First World War. Whether as a scrap of material on the battlefield or a cog in the machine of the wartime economy, the modern age has a habit of reducing the human being to a functional object. Everything "non-essential" - everything, that is, that makes us human - is blithely discarded."

OSWEGO — Seven of Oswego County’s nine villages will hold elections Sept. 15 originally scheduled for March but postponed due to COVID-19.


  All villages but Pulaski and Sandy Creek will be holding Sept. 15 elections. Those two villages will be holding theirs on Nov. 3 along with the presidential election. They are the only two village elections monitored by the county Board of Elections because their election schedule is in sync with the BOE’s November election schedule, according to county Democratic Election Commissioner Laura Brazak.


  The villages of Lacona and Phoenix may join those ranks depending on the outcome of Proposition Number 1 on their Sept. 15 ballots asking voters whether their villages shall change the village election to the November general election cycle.


  No other villages are putting any propositions before their voters.


  In alphabetical order, here’s the lowdown on the seven voting villages:


  The village of Central Square will be voting on two open trustee seats. Only one candidate is on the ballot. Incumbent Millard Murphy is running for another two-year term. The other available seat may be filled by a write-in candidate. The village office polling site at 3125 East Ave. (Route 49) will be open from noon until 9 p.m. Face masks are required.


  In the village of Cleveland, elections will be held for two available trustee positions and for the office of mayor. Incumbent Robin Wilson will be running for one of the trustee seats. Eric Cartier is running for the other. Both seats are for two-year terms. In the mayor’s race, incumbent Laureen Tackman is running for another two-year term. No other candidates are on the ballot.


  The village of Hannibal will be voting for two available trustee seats. The two men running for them are both incumbents, Gordon Kellogg and Terry Wilbur. The term of office is two years. Voting will take place at the Municipal Building, 824 Cayuga St., between noon and 9 p.m.


  The village of Lacona will be voting for one available trustee seat. Incumbent Lyndon Glazier is the only candidate on the ballot for the four-year term position.


  The village of Mexico, in all likelihood, will be re-electing two incumbents to the two available trustee seats on the ballot. James Hotchkiss and Susan Linerode, both incumbents, are the only two candidates running. They will be re-elected to two-year terms barring any write-in surprise.


  The village of Parish did not return numerous calls and emails and, therefore, did not provide any information on their elections.


  And lastly, the village of Phoenix will be electing two trustees to serve two-year terms. Incumbent David Pendergast is running for one available seat. There is no other candidate on the ballot, leaving the possibility the other trustee position may be won by a write-in candidate. Voting will take place at the Enterprise Fire Co. #1, 457 Main St., Phoenix, at the rear entrance. Polls will be open from noon until 9 p.m.


  None of the county’s 22 towns are holding Sept. 15 elections. They will vote on Nov. 3.

Detener el dolor. Michael Sánchez Díaz sacó su DNI este año. Febrero del 2020 pintaba bien, cuando gestionaba el regreso a sus clases de Periodismo en la UPC. Ello, sumado a las lecciones de inglés y a las de actuación para teatro y televisión que llevaba de forma paralela, lo mantenían tan ocupado como entusiasmado. Pero llegó el 6 de marzo y las noticias dieron cuenta del registro de la primera persona contagiada con COVID-19 en el país. Y también el 16 de marzo y la decisión del Gobierno de ordenar a casi 33 millones de peruanos no salir de sus casas hasta nuevo aviso. Tras un primer impacto racional, emocional y natural, el joven de trato amable y pensamiento maduro continuó con su vida. Ya tenía experiencia con la educación superior virtual, así que aquel no fue un cambio drástico. La desgracia, sin embargo, llegaría los primeros días de junio, cuando su padre se contagió con el nuevo coronavirus al verse obligado a salir a trabajar como conductor de un bus del Corredor Azul. Don Isaac Sánchez Urrutia murió el 4 de ese mes. Lo más triste es que no partió solo. Varios familiares se fueron con él. Detener el dolor. Ese es el motivo de Michael para enrolarse como uno de los 6 mil voluntarios a los ensayos clínicos de la candidata a vacuna del laboratorio chino Sinopharm, la cual pretende prevenir el COVID-19. La primera que ha llegado a ser probada en el Perú. “La partida de mis seres queridos es lo que me mueve a contribuir con la sociedad. De esta manera puedo ayudar a que se encuentre lo más rápido posible una cura y que menos vidas sigan desapareciendo. Que menos gente siga sufriendo”, le cuenta él a Somos desde su casa en San Juan de Lurigancho. Michael forma parte del primer grupo de voluntarios que serán vacunados como parte de la fase 3 de un proyecto de investigación en el que trabajan juntos Sinopharm, la Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia (UPCH) y la Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos (UNMSM). La primera entidad, de hecho, inició esta semana el proceso de inoculación de las 3 mil personas que tendrán que monitorear por un año, luego de que estas reciban las dos dosis respectivas (San Marcos se encargará de las otras 3 mil en cuanto se encuentre lista). Cabe mencionar que, superadas las fases 1 y 2, en las que se aplica la candidata a vacuna en pequeños grupos de personas, se continúa con una tercera etapa en la que esta se prueba en 10 mil personas a más. ¿La razón? Medir a gran escala los posibles efectos secundarios de la vacuna (seguridad) y probar que esta puede prevenir el contagio del nuevo coronavirus (eficacia). “Me he estado informando sobre los efectos colaterales y no tengo miedo. Creo que quienes están a cargo son científicos que saben lo que hacen. Mi madre sí tuvo temor de que participara, pero la convencí. Es lo que me toca hacer. Aunque suene trillado, es mi grano de arena. Ojalá más jóvenes de mi edad se animen pues entiendo que otros laboratorios extranjeros también harán ensayos aquí. Se va a necesitar miles de personas más”, cuenta Michael. Efectivamente, otras compañías comenzarán ensayos clínicos en peruanos durante las próximas semanas. Entre ellas AstraZeneca, que investiga en conjunto con la Universidad de Oxford; y la farmacéutica estadounidense Johnson and Johnson, a través de su filial Janssen. Hay que mencionar que la vacuna de Sinopharm ha demostrado hasta el momento generar leves efectos secundarios en quienes pusieron el hombro para las respectivas fases 1 y 2. Fatiga, fiebre ligera y dolores de cabeza o en el lugar donde se aplicó la inyección son algunos de ellos. Perseverar ante la adversidad. El 30 de agosto, Luz Sánchez Domínguez (25) se levantó temprano. Se alistó y a las 10 a.m. estuvo frente a su computadora. Se había informado de que las inscripciones para ser voluntaria en la web www.vacunacovid.pe se abrirían a las 11, pero pensó que podía tener suerte si intentaba con antelación. Así que se pasó una hora entera ‘refrescando’ la página para ser una de las primeras en anotarse. Funcionó. Así como también el haber estado atenta desde marzo a las noticias relacionadas con las vacunas que le pondrían alto a la pandemia. “Siempre tuve la idea de participar en algún ensayo. Apenas supe que necesitaban gente, se lo dije a mi familia y esta me apoyó totalmente. De hecho, mi papá también quiso ofrecerse, pero no se pudo inscribir porque, como sabemos, las 3 mil personas que se requerían inicialmente se consiguieron en 10 minutos”, narra la comunicadora, hoy sin empleo y a cargo de las compras y salidas del hogar. Ella vive en San Miguel junto a su papá hipertenso y su madre y hermana. En cuanto sea citada, Luz pasará en la sede de la UPCH unos exámenes médicos que la habilitarán finalmente para ser parte del estudio. Lo mismo sucederá con todos los voluntarios preseleccionados. Ella deberá declarar y demostrar que no ha estado enferma de COVID-19 (a menos que no lo haya sabido en una eventual condición de asintomática; en ese caso, sí se le tomará en cuenta porque también se estudiará la pérdida de la inmunidad en el tiempo de estos casos). Asimismo, que no padece alguna enfermedad que no esté controlada y, que al ser mujer, no esté embarazada. Por su parte, ella se comprometerá a recibir dos dosis de la vacuna de Sinopharm y también a que su estado de salud sea monitoreado a diario por un año, ya sea a través de una aplicación o vía telefónica. Igualmente, firmará un consentimiento informado que detalla los beneficios y las potenciales reacciones adversas del procedimiento. La dinámica del ensayo clínico ha sido así explicada por Germán Málaga, coordinador del Centro de Estudios Clínicos de la UPCH. Perseverar ante la adversidad. “Seguiré hasta el final en lo que pueda ayudar”. Vocación de servicio. “Creo que todos tenemos una responsabilidad. Soy odontólogo y administrador y para desempeñar cualquiera de esos dos oficios postulé a las convocatorias del Ministerio de Salud en marzo. No me llamaron, pero no claudiqué en mi afán de hacer algo por el resto y aquí estoy, ya registrado para recibir la posible vacuna que ayude a parar todo esto”. Quien habla es Alexander Rivera (50), asmático, soltero, vecino de Bellavista. Un señor cortés, empático y comprometido que no deja de compartir información relevante sobre el COVID-19 en su muro de Facebook, en los chats de WhastApp con sus colegas y amigos. Se necesitarán seis meses desde el inicio de estos ensayos para saber si se se puede producir la vacuna de forma masiva. Rivera es optimista respecto a todo. Por eso alienta a sus amigos a poner de su parte cuidándose, a dar la mano en lo que puedan. Vocación de servicio. “Cuántos doctores o policías se han sacrificado. No puede ser en vano... Siempre he creído que hay que hacer algo de manera individual o colectiva. La clave está en que cada uno encuentre qué o cómo”. //

Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi (R) meets with Indian External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar on the sidelines of a meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization Council of Foreign Ministers in Moscow, Russia, on Sept. 10, 2020. (Photo: Xinhua)
       China's State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi met Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar in Moscow Thursday evening, and they reached a five-point consensus. This is generally believed to provide an important opportunity for China and India to ease the border situation. The two foreign ministers passed on their goodwill to each other, expressed common understanding that the current border tensions are not in line with the two countries' interests, and expressed their wish to maintain peace and tranquility at the border. This helps cool down the two countries' public opinion.      The consensus again mentioned the two troops should disengage as soon as possible, maintain a necessary distance, and speed up the completion of new measures to build mutual trust. Whether in terms of crisis management or maintaining long-term stability at the border area, the consensus has hit the key points.      But how should the consensus be implemented? Chinese and Indian leaders met many times and reached consensus after the Doklam standoff, but then border conflicts happened again. In June, the deadly clash happened, and Indian troops fired threatening shots at the Chinese army on Monday. The border situation has repeatedly eroded people's confidence in the implementation of the agreement.      The fundamental problem between China and India is the lack of basic mutual trust. The border issue has been fully activated, forming the two societies' confrontation of wills. Both believe they have the advantage, and China's advantage is based on strength. The gap between China and India in national strength is much wider than in 1962. India's sense of superiority comes from its geopolitical mobilization capabilities. The US, Japan and Australia are trying to win over India. New Delhi believes Beijing is afraid of this since China is being strategically blocked by the US. India believes China will yield at the border.      China takes a defensive position, but India is trying to connect the China- India border conflicts with Indo-Pacific geopolitics, which is a gamble.      China and India have both developed over the years. Although India's GDP is only one-fifth of China's, it also has the ability to strengthen infrastructure in border areas. The two countries' strengths extend to the border, and the opportunities for frictions have increased sharply. The previous control mechanism, without the reinforcement of political mutual trust, has been riddled.      On the other hand, China and India do not want to start a new war. The two militaries have engaged in scuffles many times, which have led to casualties. Indian troops have fired warning shots, but there has been no serious military conflict between the two sides. This has only happened at China-India border areas, which is enough to show the two countries do not want a war.      But the repeated conflicts and confrontations also show that restoring peace at the border is no longer easy. The problem lies with India.      There are different forces in India, and the Indian government has less control over border policies than China. Nationalist sentiment through India's election mechanism has a strong influence on the Indian government.      India's national strength has indeed increased, but its gap with China has widened. However, Indian society does not believe so. Indian nationalist forces always have been conceited, such as "it is not 1962 anymore," or India can come back with a vengeance on China once another war breaks out at the border. They have seriously overestimated their strength and support from the US, Japan and Australia. Some even imagine that a new China-India border war will be a joint war between the US, Japan, Australia, India and China.      India's public opinion mechanism has led to frequent exchanges between the Indian military and media. The country's public opinion war against China is active. The Indian military needs to release such information as "preemptive strike" and "seize the commanding heights" to please the public. This has boosted Indian troops' aggressiveness.      Facts show that it is difficult for China to keep India rational on important issues through persuasion and talks. Our effective use of strength is indispensable. We must increase the cost of risky gambles of India on the border issue. While making diplomatic efforts, we need to be prepared to completely defeat India's illusions through military actions when those efforts fail.      To maintain territorial integrity and long-term tranquility of our southwest border, no price is too high. This is not a slogan, but should be our true will. Chinese people love peace, but we will also fight when we have to. This is not just a facade to the outside world, but who we are.

With political tensions on the rise in advance of November’s election, local partisans are reporting a concerning increase in theft and vandalism of yard signs.


  The development is concerning both Rice County Republicans Chair Kathy Dodds and Rice County DFL Chair Shawn Groth. While they might disagree on many things, the two local party leaders used much the same language in condemning the thefts.


  “It’s not a way to conduct business or conduct an election,” Groth said. “People have a right to have their lawn signs up, and we all should respect that right.”


  Dodds said that throughout the county, the Rice County Republicans and Trump Victory Campaign have had to replace numerous signs after theft or vandalism. Even her own neighbor had to have her signs replaced after they were stolen about a month ago, she said.


  “It’s a form of shutting down free speech and competition,” Dodds said. “It is criminal to do, and costly for us the people who buy the signs and put up the signs.”


  At this point, Groth said that he hasn’t heard local reports of stolen or vandalized Biden campaign signs. However, unlike Republicans, who have had Trump signs up for months, the county DFL just received the signs last Friday.


  In years past, Groth said that he’s had signs stolen from his yard. Though they haven’t been stolen or vandalized yet, Groth said that the signs have already elicited negative comments from people walking by.


  “It’s always on the back of my mind (that they could be stolen),” he said. “I’m sure we’ll hear about Biden signs being taken or vandalized.”


  Minnesota hasn’t voted for a Republican for president since 1972, the longest streak of any state in the nation. However, polls indicate that Trump is within striking distance of Democratic nominee Joe Biden in Minnesota, thanks mainly to strong support in greater Minnesota. In recent days, that’s led both the Republican and Democratic campaigns to double down their focus on Minnesota as a true “swing state. With Republican enthusiasm for President Trump at high levels, Trump flags, signs and banners dot the county, particularly in rural areas.


  In liberal-leaning Northfield, the look is a bit different. With Democrats enjoying strong support there, signs for Biden and other local candidates like Rep. Angie Craig and State Rep. Todd Lippert are much more common.


  Both parties' signs can be vulnerable to theft or vandalism. Faribault Police Capt. Neal Pederson said that his department has been receiving reports of local yard sign thefts. In some cases, the department has worked with homeowners to stop the thefts, such as by installing security cameras. In one case, Pederson said that the department caught a couple of juveniles stealing signs. However, he said that the police often follow the lead of homeowners interested in a more lenient approach, particularly when juveniles may be involved.


  Phil Brooks, a local supporter of President Trump, said that he’s had two large Trump signs stolen from his fence. His neighbor’s even larger pro-Trump display, which also includes signs for other Republican candidates, has been subject to vandalism.


  Still, Brooks and his neighbor have kept the pro-Trump signage in their yard. While he said that’s netted him some verbal abuse, Brooks said that many others stop by to honk their horns, take pictures and express their strong support for the president and Republicans.


  John Culhane, another local Trump supporter, said that he’d put up signs for prior Republican candidates like John McCain and Mitt Romney without issue. However, he had three Trump signs stolen from his yard in 2016 and another this year.


  Culhane said he isn’t the only local Trump supporter to lose his signs. However, he said that he has hesitated to report the issue to police because he suspects many of the culprits are likely juveniles, and doesn’t want them to get in too much trouble.


  “If you’ve got a kid who’s in seventh grade, and is (stealing the sign) because somebody told him that Trump is a racist, he doesn’t need to get in trouble,” Culhane said. “The police have enough things to worry about without worrying about my yard sign.”

 At about 10 p.m. last Dec. 13, in the area of Worcester Street and Wheeler Road in Grafton, Etre observed a car driving at a high speed down a steep hill. The car struck a patch of black ice, spun off the road, and jumped over an embankment into the Quinsigamond River.
 A teenage boy escaped, but a teenage girl was trapped inside the sinking car.
 Etre entered the water and, using a wrench from his car, broke the passenger window to free the victim and guide her through freezing water to the shore.
 Police, fire and EMS personnel responded and found the car fully submerged and empty. Both teenagers were taken to UMass Memorial Hospital in Worcester without serious injury.
 "Putting his own life at risk, Chris Etre personified the selfless courage we remember Madeline 'Amy' Sweeney for," Gov. Charlie Baker said in a statement. "In the face of life-threatening danger, he acted quickly and decisively to bring a stranger to safety and is an inspirational example of her (Sweeney's) legacy. "
 Sweeney was in the first of two aircraft hijacked by terrorists and flown into the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center in New York City. Before the plane hit the North Tower, Sweeney contacted the airline's ground services crew to convey critical information about the hijackers and their actions on the plane.
 The award was created for Sweeney's heroism and the 2,977 victims of the terror attacks.
 "Nineteen years ago, Amy Sweeney's extraordinary bravery saved countless lives," Lt. Gov. Karyn Polito said. "Heroes like Chris Etre remind us each and every day of the incredible sacrifice that Amy and so many others made on Sept. 11, 2001."
 Etre was nominated for the award by state Sen. Michael Moore, D-Millbury; state Rep. David Muradian, R-Grafton; and Grafton Police Chief Normand A. Crepeau Jr.
 Etre was selected by a selection committee that is chaired by Polito.
 "Chris Etre's quick action to save a young teenager from certain death in icy waters was exactly the kind of heroic and selfless act that the Madeline Amy Sweeney Award for Civilian Bravery aims to honor," Moore said. "Chris deserves to be honored for his bravery in a situation which certainly placed him in imminent danger and could have resulted in the loss of a young life."
 A week after the accident, Etre told reporters: "Honestly, I would like to think that someone would do the same if it were one of my own three children in that car. Grateful for the outcome as they now have their whole lives ahead of them. I hope this will inspire them as well as whoever followed the story to do the right thing and help someone in need or danger."
 In January, Etre was honored by Grafton officials.

"There are certain young people that game that we can't actively recruit because of their age," Duncan said. "But if we can build that interest in them when they are young, when it comes time for them to make decisions about what they want to do with their future, we hope that their experience interacting with the esports team will plant a seed that, hey, maybe I can be a soldier."
 Esports team members stream practically around the clock on Twitch -- in some cases a single shift is 9 a.m. to 10 p.m.
 "All we are doing is pulling the curtain away and showing you who we are as people," Sgt. 1st Class Christopher Jones, general manager of the Army esports team, told Business Insider Weekly. "Now we are actually telling you, hey, we're just like you. We understand one another. We're both gamers. We both live in this ecosystem that is gaming and esports, so why not have that conversation?"
 The esports program started in 2018 after the Army missed its recruiting goal for the first time in 13 years. It became clear that old ways of recruiting -- at college career fairs and by making cold calls to landlines -- were no longer working.

The Premier League said Friday it would defer holding test events to bring fans back into stadiums because the UK government's cap of 1,000 supporters was too limiting.


  The English top-flight was forced to finish last season behind closed doors when it resumed after the coronavirus lockdown.


  The 2020/21 campaign kicks off on Saturday, with stadiums around England remaining empty due to the continued threat of the pandemic as infection numbers show an alarming spike.


  Prime Minister Boris Johnson said this week that pilot events for sport in September would be restricted to 1,000 fans, with strict conditions in place.


  He also said plans for spectators to attend sporting events in England from October were to be reviewed.


  But the Premier League said a limit of 1,000 fans would not allow it to properly test and evaluate safety measures and matches would be loss-making.


  "Premier League clubs will defer holding test events until a sufficient number of fans are allowed back to enable thorough trials to take place," it said in a statement.


  It gave a stark warning of the financial damage to the game as a result of empty stadiums.


  "For each month of the season without fans, more than £100 million ($128 million) is lost to football across the leagues, with consequent damage to the local and national economy," it said.


  "It also harms the employment prospects of more than 100,000 people whose jobs depend on matchday activities."


  The Premier League said clubs could offer larger-scale trials to prove it was possible to produce safe environments.


  "As the government begins its review of the 1 October date for the return of spectators to sport, the Premier League asks that the high safety standards which can be achieved by our clubs are fully taken into account before any decision is taken and that sport is not left behind other industries," it said.

August 26 was Women's Equality Day, and with it we commemorated our right to march to the polls in November, confident in our place there, no questions asked.
 If only that confidence conveyed into all other areas of women's lives.
 Despite our progress in the past century -- in voting rights, employment rights, reproductive rights, and more -- the empowerment message is often weak when it comes to women and financial matters.
 According to a 2019 Women, Money, and Power Study from Allianz Life, our money mojo started slipping even before COVID-19 descended. In 2019, fewer women (42%) reported having more earning power than in previous years (it was 50% in 2016 and 57% in 2013). Forty seven percent said they were the CFO of their household compared to 51% in 2016 and 53% in 2013. And fewer women reported feeling financially secure overall (62% in 2019 versus 68% in 2016). More than half of the women polled (57%) said they wished they were more confident in their financial decision making.

       Microsoft's warning on hacking from several countries, including China, cannot hold water, and the US firm's kowtowing to the Trump administration is intended to facilitate its buyout of TikTok, Chinese officials and experts said Friday.      The comments follow a release by Microsoft on Thursday that claimed hackers with so-called "ties" to Russia, China and Iran have been attempting to target people and groups associated with the US 2020 presidential election, including attacking those with links to both the Trump and Biden campaigns.      According to Microsoft, Zirconium, operating from China, has attacked some high-profile individuals with connections to the US election, including those associated with Joe Biden for President campaign as well as other prominent leaders in the international affairs community.      It also mentioned two other "hacking groups" by the names of Strontium, allegedly operating from Russia, and Phosphorus from Iran.      Microsoft should not make things up, and should not use China as a card, Zhao Lijian, spokesperson of the Chinese Foreign Ministry, told a regular briefing on Friday.      "We have no interest and intention to interfere in the US presidential election. Many US intelligence officials recently told US media that US intelligence agencies have not seen evidence of China's interference in the election," said Zhao.      "China would never do anything to target the US presidential election," Shen Yi, a professor at the School of International Relations and Public Affairs of Fudan University told the Global Times on Friday.

FLORENCE, Ala. (AP) — A factory that employs hundreds of people manufacturing railroad cars in north Alabama is closing amid declining demand linked to the coronavirus pandemic. FreightCar America announced Thursday it is shutting down its plant at Cherokee and plans to abandon the facility by early next year to consolidate operations in Castanos, Mexico. Kevin Jackson, president of the Shoals Economic Development Authority, said the factory has about 500 workers, according to the TimesDaily. The factory makes cars used to haul bulk goods and other items. The problem of depressed demand for freight cars has been made worse by the pandemic, and the company is trying to get ready for “immediate success” after the downtown, said a statement by chief executive Jim Meyer. The shutdown will save more than $20 million annually in fixed costs and make it possible for the company to break even by producing less than 2,000 cars annually, the statement said.

    Qian Feng, director of the research department of the National Strategy Institute at Tsinghua University in Beijing, told the Global Times on Friday that the joint statement showed that under the current situation, the highest levels of the two governments are unwilling to further escalate conflicts as the de-escalation of tensions will be conducive to the two countries' interests.      Qian noted that the five-point consensus - the short and concise agreement by the two counties - plans the direction for the next phase of discussions.      The consensus involves maintaining communication through meetings by the Special Representatives of India and China and expediting the completion of new measures to build mutual trust, marking an important step since the conflicts first took place, he added.      However, given India's past history of breaking consensuses reached at such meetings, some Chinese experts stressed that it's still too early to pin high hopes on its implementation.      While the joint press release looks fine on paper, the actual addressing of future border tensions remains unclear as India has a long history of breaking its promises, Hu Zhiyong, a research fellow at the Institute of International Relations of the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Friday.      "We should not only observe what India says, but also what it does. For a country like India, the most important thing is how it acts," Hu said.      In 2005, then Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao held important talks with Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh before signing a joint statement by the two governments, in which both sides declared the establishment of a strategic partnership to promote peace and prosperity. The two governments also signed the Agreement on the Political Guiding Principles for Resolving the Boundary Issue between China and India, in which they pledged to reduce armed forces and maintain peace.      "However, since Modi assumed power, the Indian government has totally neglected this joint statement. China has kept its word, but the Indian side has provoked the recent border clashes," Hu told the Global Times, stressing that this time China should remain on high alert.      Given the country's sluggish economy and poor epidemic control, the Modi government may continue to try and stir up border tensions in an attempt to deflect the public's attention. These border tensions are used as chips to fool the public, he noted.

And while other streaming giants offer free or less expensive subscription plans that are ad-supported, Netflix so far has been content to simply raise its prices every few years as it builds out its vault of originals.
 In recent weeks, Netflix has begun to dabble in free marketing-related offerings. While not an actual free subscription, it now allows non- subscribers to watch the first episode of some of its original series and some full-length movies as a way to encourage them to subscribe.
 Hulu, a major competitor, launched live TV add-ons in recent years as a way to diversify content and bring in new revenue. When asked if Netflix would follow suit, Hastings said that for now, "every content dollar is spoken for," as Ted Sarandos, co-CEO and Chief Content Officer is focusing on "bigger movies, bigger series, [and] animation of course."
 Other topics in the interview included filming during the coronavirus pandemic, competitors in the streaming market, and decisions the CEO regrets. You can read the entire Variety interview here.

ANKARA, Turkey (AP) — Turkey has called on European Union countries to abandon a policy of “blindly” taking the side of EU members Greece and Cyprus in a standoff over energy exploration in the eastern Mediterranean. Turkey's Foreign Ministry on Friday also urged Greece to reduce the ongoing tensions by backing a NATO initiative that aims to reduce the risk of armed conflict at sea and by withdrawing Greek warships that are monitoring the activities of a warship-escorted Turkish research ship. The Turkish statements were directed at the leaders of seven southern European countries. They urged Turkey on Thursday to end its “unilateral and illegal activities” in the eastern Mediterranean.

 # Jury trials set to resume in Polk County in October following COVID-19 shutdown
 Suzie Schottelkotte
 The Ledger
 BARTOW – Seven months after Florida courtrooms shut down amid the COVID-19 pandemic, Polk County is gearing up to bring jurors back into the courthouse.
 Courthouse officials in Polk County, one of three counties in the 10th Judicial Circuit, have been conducting court hearings virtually, using technology to bring defendants and civil litigants, and their lawyers, before a judge. For now, that practice will continue.
 But declining COVID-19 cases, coupled with measures to protect those visiting or working in the Polk County Courthouse in Bartow, have cleared the way for jury trials to resume next month. Court officials have scheduled the first jury trials since March for the second week of October.
 “Everyone will be masked, and jurors will observe social distancing in the courtroom and the jury rooms,” said Court Administrator Nick Sudzina.
 Court officials are beginning slowly, starting with three one-day criminal trials on Oct. 5 and another two Oct. 7. The trials will require only six jurors, allowing adequate social distancing in the jury box, he said.
 Once jurors get to the courtroom, they’ll find plexiglass panels on either side of the judge’s bench, separating the judge from the witness stand and the trial clerk’s work station.
 Sudzina said all potential jurors will be screened for COVID-19 symptoms, including a temperature check, as they enter the courthouse.
 Stacy Butterfield, Polk County’s clerk of courts and comptroller, said the county has taken the trial hiatus to streamline the juror registration process. In the past, jurors brought in written questionaires when they reported for jury duty.
 “We’re now asking jurors to complete those online before they arrive,” she said. If that’s not possible, computer stations will be available at the courthouse.
 Potential jurors won’t gather in the 220-seat meeting room where they traditionally have assembled for orientation. Instead, they will be directed to the courtroom where they may serve as a juror, Butterfield said. Should that courtroom become filled, she said, overflow jurors may use an adjacent courtroom where they will see the same orientation through closed-circuit television.
 Sudzina said changes in the court system mandated by the COVID-19 pandemic have created a backlog of cases on the criminal and civil court dockets.
 “We know there are new filings coming in for mortgage foreclosures and evictions, but if those are for COVID reasons, they have a respite now,” he said, referencing a state order suspending foreclosures and evictions. “When that is lifted, there’s going to be an influx of those cases coming in.”
 Sudzina said the courts can bring in senior judges to assist with the enhanced caseload, so that isn’t a problem.
 “We have the people to do that,” he said, “but we have to make sure we have the space.”
 There’s also the pandemic itself to consider. If the county experiences a spike in new cases, jury trials could go back on the shelf.
 Since the pandemic began in March, the Florida Supreme Court has taken a conservative approach to managing the state’s court system. The high court established a phased system to reopen courtrooms, setting criteria that must be met before counties could move to the next of four phases.
 Polk County remained in Phase 1, the most restrictive phase, until Aug. 31, when a reduction in countywide COVID-19 cases allowed the county to move into Phase 2. Court officials also had to meet other requirements, including the absence of COVID-19 cases in the courthouse for the two prior weeks and the absence of a countywide stay-at-home mandate.
 After moving to Phase 2, court officials were required to wait 30 days before opening the courthouse to jury trials, Sudzina said.
 Butterfield said her office began sending out jury summonses to residents Sept. 3, with another batch going out Sept. 10, for the October court trials.
 But the current efforts aren’t going to affect some of the county’s more serious crimes, including capital murders. Sudzina said first-degree murders, which require 12 jurors and often take more than one week in trial, will remain suspended.
 “That is going to be a ways away,” he said. “Those will take additional measures for social distancing and other issues.”
 The pandemic has delayed rulings in other murder cases that have been to trial already, including the death penalty case of 30-year-old Cheyanne Jessie. She was convicted in July 2019 for the murders of her father and 6-year-old daughter, and the 12-member jury recommended the death penalty for her daughter’s death. Since then, her sentencing has been rescheduled several times, initially for legal reasons and more recently because of COVID-19. It’s currently set for Nov. 3.
 In March, as the COVID-19 pandemic grew worse, a jury convicted Andre Warner of murdering a Winter Haven man who was targeted following a social media date arranged through the plentyoffish.com app. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty, but because of the pandemic, that jury was dismissed before it could consider a sentencing recommendation. Now, a new 12-member jury will be seated to hear evidence and make that recommendation to Circuit Judge Jalal Harb. No date has been set for that jury selection.

As a weary Serena Williams packed her bags and left Flushing Meadows in the early hours of Friday morning, her latest bid for a record-equalling 24th Grand Slam title snuffed out in the semi-finals of the US Open, one question was left hanging in the balmy night air: if not now, when?


  For nearly four years, Williams has been trading groundstrokes with Father Time as she attempts to add one more Grand Slam title to her collection, cementing her claim to be the greatest women's tennis player ever seen.


  Yet since her 23rd and last major title at the 2017 Australian Open, when she was pregnant with daughter Olympia, the window of opportunity has been closing.


  Did that window slam shut on Thursday night? Only time will tell.


  Certainly, throughout her career, be it returning from serious illness to dominate her sport, or from continuing to compete at the highest level at an age when most of her contemporaries have long since retired, Williams has repeatedly demonstrated that writing her off is a mug's game.


  \- Opportunity lost? -


  But it is hard to avoid the conclusion that the 2020 US Open offered Williams by far her best chance of finally matching Margaret Court's total of 24 Grand Slam singles crowns.


  Williams, who will turn 39 this month, seemed disinterested by the question of whether she will ever reach that milestone.


  "How does making it deep into majors affect your resolve to keep up the pursuit for as long as it might take to get to number 24?" one reporter asked her following Thursday's gruelling 1-6, 6-3, 6-3 defeat to Victoria Azarenka.


  "I don't know," she replied. "I just -- I don't know. I haven't thought about that actually. I don't know."


  For many, however, there was an unmistakeable sense of an opportunity gone begging.


  The unique circumstances of this year's US Open, taking place in a season upended by the coronavirus pandemic, had offered Williams a path to the title far less hazardous than it might normally have been.


  Six of the top 10 players in the world, including world number one Ashleigh Barty and world number two Simona Halep, opted to skip the tournament.


  So too did the defending champion, Canada's Bianca Andreescu, who defeated Williams in the 2019 final.


  \- 'Weakest US Open' -


  It meant three of the four reigning Grand Slam champions were absent from New York. Tracy Austin, the two-time US Open champion, called it the "weakest US Open of the Open era."


  And by the time Thursday's semi-finals had rolled around, Williams was the highest remaining seed in the draw, after top seed Karolina Pliskova exited in the second round and second seed Sofia Kenin bowed out in the last 16.


  Throughout the past fortnight, Williams had offered plenty of reminders that she still possesses a substantial residue of the talent that has put her at or near the pinnacle of women's tennis in four different decades.


  In her quarter-final against Tsvetana Pironkova, she hammered down no fewer than 20 aces and an array of serves that were borderline unplayable.


  However the resurgent Azarenka, who like Williams has successfully continued her career after becoming a mother, proved a bridge too far in the last four.


  It means Williams will now turn her attention to the rescheduled French Open in Paris later this month.


  While she has won at Roland Garros three times before, clay is by no means her preferred surface.


  Her last victory in Paris came in 2015; in 2019 she was eliminated in the third round. By any objective measure, the 24th title will probably have to wait.


  In any case, some wonder whether too much is made of the "quest for 24".


  US tennis legend Billie Jean-King points out that in other eras, many top players regularly chose to skip certain Grand Slams altogether in their prime.


  "You gotta remember we didn't play the Australian Open for many, many years - we played the Virginia Slims in San Francisco," King said in a recent interview.


  "And we also played Team Tennis during the French Open. "I think (Chris Evert and Martina Navratilova] would have had a lot more than 24, quite frankly."

MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) — Nineteen Nicaraguans who say they suffered torture and sexual abuse at the hands of their country's security forces testified to a panel of legal and psychological experts this week, determined not to allow the pandemic to further forestall their search for justice. The exercise, carried out over several days in a hotel in Costa Rica’s capital, was meant in part to build cases that could eventually be taken to regional and international courts. The alleged abuses occurred during protests against the government of Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega from April to August 2018. Police and forces dressed as civilians brutally repressed what Ortega termed an attempted coup. The victims offered online video testimony of what the experts called systematic sexual abuse aimed at terrorizing their captives. It ranged from repeated rape to amputation of fingers and psychological torture. The so-called Court of Conscience was organized by Costa Rica’s Arias Foundation. Some 80,000 Nicaraguan refugees and asylum seekers live in neighboring Costa Rica, including many who suffered abuses at the hands of Nicaraguan authorities. The accounts offered to the panel could not be independently verified — the victims were not identified by name — but they were very similar to descriptions of abuses described to The Associated Press by victims in Nicaragua in 2018 and to those documented by human rights organizations. “This can’t continue to be a simple complaint,” said Roberto Samcam, a retired Nicaraguan army major now exiled in Guatemala, who served as the panel’s chain-of-command expert. “We are documenting each case so that it can move on to a trial, possibly before the Inter-American Court of Human Rights.” Nicaragua’s protests began in...

Horse lovers can take heart to know their equine friends were not forgotten by those who made up star patterns, and chose which would be on the official constellation list. We have two celestial horses, and both are well in view on late summer and autumn evenings.      They include Pegasus, the Flying Horse, and Equuleus, the Colt or Little Horse. That's only two out of the 88 constellations. You can stretch things by adding Centaurus the Centaur, but in Greek mythology, the centaur is half horse and half man.      Pegasus is very large and prominent in the night sky. Since all constellations appear to pass over the sky as the Earth takes its daily spin, it may seem obvious that Pegasus is indeed a "flying" horse. Of course like the other ancient constellations, they were based on mythological stories and immortalized among the stars for future generations to remember.      The most well-known feature of this constellation is the "Great Square" asterism, a pattern within the constellation formed by four stars marking the corners. This is a stellar landmark.      Interestingly, the Great Square is not entirely in Pegasus. One of the stars is in the neighboring constellation Andromeda. Astronomers have plotted the constellations with defined boundaries marked on star atlases. In any case, Pegasus and Andromeda appear forever linked due to the Great Square.      Most constellation patterns hardly resemble what they are supposed to represent. The brighter stars of Andromeda and Pegasus, however, happen to be placed so that, together, it is not hard to picture more or less a complete horse, with the Great Square as the body. One problem: this extended "horse" pattern, as viewed from the Northern Hemisphere, is upside down in the sky!      Andromeda, the Maiden, is mainly seen as two strands of conspicuous stars. Imagined as part of this "horse," they become the equine's back legs.      Andromeda is on the eastern side of the Great Square (to the left as seen from northern latitudes). To the west (right) of the square are the stars we may imagine as the horse's front legs, neck and head.      As it is seen rising in the east, the Great Square appears standing like a great "baseball diamond" of sorts. There are only two stars easily seen with unaided eyes on a fairly dark night inside the Great Square; these might be thought of as "home plate."      Here are the names of the stars marking the corners of the Great Square. The star within the Andromeda constellation is Alpheratz. Going clockwise, the next corner star is Scheat, then Markab and finally Algenib.      Using Scheat and Markab as pointers, extend a line far down to the southeast to find the bright bluish star Fomalhaut.      The leading star in Pegasus, the one furthest to the west (right) can be imagined as the animal's snout. The star's name is Enif (or Epsilon Pegasi).      Enif is an orange supergiant star, about 690 light-years away. It shines at magnitude +2.4.      Going a bit deeper in the hobby of amateur astronomy, telescope users enjoy exploring Pegasus to track down several dim galaxies. Double stars are colored stars are also worthy prizes in any part of the sky.      A small telescope will also locate a fine globular star cluster, M15, just west of the star Enif. It appears as a small, dim, hazy patch in binoculars. Depending on the size of the telescope and magnification, you may easily resolve this hazy patch into a concentrated ball of faint stars.      Equuleus, the Little Horse, is a small constellation of dim stars, right next to Pegasus - to the west (right) of Enif and below M15.      While talking about starry horses, check out the handle of the Big Dipper, in the northwest on September evenings, The middle star, Mizar, is a fine double star, which you may be able to resolve with just your eyes. A faint star right next to it called Alcor. These have been nicknamed as the "Horse and Rider" (Mizar is the horse).   Then there's the Horsehead Nebula in the constellation Orion. Nebulae are vast interstellar clouds of dust and gas. The Horsehead appears very much like its name, a black silhouette superimposed on a more distant nebula that shines by reflected starlight. The Horsehead is very difficult to detect in a telescope, without taking a long-exposure photograph.      Be sure to see the red planet Mars, which this month (Sept. 2020) is very bright leading up to closest approach in October. Mars is dominating the eastern sky on September evenings, well below the Great Square.      Meanwhile brilliant Jupiter shines in the south in the evening, with Saturn about 10 degrees to the east (left). Look about an hour before sunrise for brilliant Venus in the twilight glow of the eastern sky.      New moon is on Sept. 17.   Keep looking up at the sky!
