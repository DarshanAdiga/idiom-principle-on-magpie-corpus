The minimum 4.5% CET1 Ratio requirement is augmented by 3.5% in Pillar 1 Capital Buffers, which can absorb losses during periods of stress. The Pillar 1 Capital Buffers include a 2.5% Capital Conservation Buffer, a 1.0% Common Equity Tier 1 Surcharge for domestic systematically important banks (D-SIBs) and a Countercyclical Buffer as prescribed by OSFI (immaterial for the fourth quarter of 2020). If a bank's capital ratios fall within the range of this combined buffer, restrictions on discretionary distributions of earnings (such as dividends, share repurchases and discretionary compensation) would ensue, with the degree of such restrictions varying according to the position of the bank's ratios within the buffer range.

J&J has two vaccine trials in the works: one that tests a one-dose schedule, and a newer trial testing a two-dose schedule. Both of these trials use the same platform, which was recently used to produce an approved Ebola vaccine. Its one-dose trial preliminarily reported favorable safety and efficacy data in early October, and investors can expect another update before the end of the year. If everything goes according to plan, healthcare systems should start receiving doses for distribution to the public early in 2021.

For the first time in his career, Reid temporarily felt uncomfortable with the standard of football.                                         “From when I was at Man United training and at Plymouth as a kid, all the way through the levels, that time at West Brom was the only time I thought ‘wow’.                                         “They’d just been relegated from the Premier League and some of the lads were welcoming, while others were not.                                         “Some didn’t speak English and when international players saw me on the bench ahead of them, when they may have been on £40,000 a week and I was on £5,000, that’s how it goes.                                         “There is no way I got a fair crack of it at West Brom, but 90 per cent of that was down to me.                                         “Even when I felt up to speed and more comfortable, winning the lads’ respect and feeling part of it, I was used as a right winger, which was just not me.”                                         Reid saw himself as a centre forward, capable of running powerfully at defenders, but the defensive side of being a winger did not come naturally.                                          “I didn’t perform well and in my contract I had a 10-match appearance clause, which would have earned me an improvement on what was already a good deal.                                         “I got to eight and didn’t make the bench again, so it was clear I didn’t have a long term future.                                         “Maybe they thought I wasn’t up to the standard and they were probably right.”                                         Reid was loaned to Peterborough United, who were struggling in the Championship at the time.                                         “Robbie (Di Matteo) and Eddie Newton wanted me to stay and continue my development, but I forced a move because I wanted to be playing first team football, which was down to my naivety.                                         “I played some minutes in the Championship, but the loan didn’t go well overall.”                                         He was signed by Mark Cooper, who was soon replaced by Jim Gannon.                                         “I was terrible to be honest and that was partly down to my professionalism.                                         “I had 18 months left on my West Brom contract, so I had that comfort and again I was played wide right.”                                         Reid returned to West Brom, now back in the Premier League, for pre-season ahead of the 2010/11 campaign.                                         “I had a Championship medal around my neck and we had the parade, but quite early on I got the call saying I needed a season-long loan and everything changed when the club moved up a level because they were attracting a whole new level of player.”                                         He joined Walsall, playing under boss Chris Hutchings, but the spell was affected by a hamstring injury.                                         “It was a good loan, but the injury stopped it being a really good one.                                  *[FT]: Financial Times

“Chris was a nice guy and I played up front. In January he said he wanted to keep me and I’d have been happy to stay, but he was sacked, Dean Smith took over and I was told they couldn’t afford to keep me, but maybe he just didn’t fancy me.”                                         Reid was then in a small group at West Brom training separately, excluded from the Premier League squad along with the likes of Romaine Sawyers, Chris Wood, Abdoulaye Méïté and George Thorne.

This could mean testing people in a specific geographic area where infection rates are high, with the entire local population being tested every three days. Other possibilities suggested by the Department of Health include testing people over a certain age, or testing all school pupils, parents and staff, twice a week.                         Speaking at a Downing Street press conference on Monday, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said mass testing in Liverpool had helped move the whole city down to tier two.                         He said: "In Liverpool, where over 300,000 people – both with symptoms and without – where that testing has happened, they’ve managed to bring the case rates down by over three-quarters.

“But in a game live on Sky I was chasing a ball up the line and my quad tore. That injury niggled me for ages and I left at the end of the season.”                                         After his brief spell under Johnson at Yeovil, Reid was the offered the chance to rejoin Plymouth, who were now under the management of John Sheridan, but struggling in League Two.                                         “I jumped at that and we managed to stay up. I had another year at Yeovil, who had just got into the Championship and that probably tells you getting rid of me was the right decision!                                         “Sheridan said he wanted me for next season and Gary Johnson was all too happy for me to go, so I did.                                         “I argued with Sheridan every day and he constantly told me how bad and inefficient I was, but every Saturday or Tuesday, I was in the team and he wanted all the lads to kick the ball to me, so it worked.                                         “Every touch I had was hounded, which is what my dad used to do when I was young when he was chucking cricket balls or footballs at me.                                         “But it made me think ‘I’ll show you’ and Sheridan sets his teams up for the strikers to score and do well because he likes to get the ball forward early, so the pressure is on you to produce and that benefitted me.”                                         Reid enjoyed a 21-goal season back at Argyle in 2013/14 and that was followed up by another 20 goals in 2014/15, but he ended that campaign with a serious foot injury as they missed out in the play-off semi-finals to Wycombe.                                         “Derek Adams came in and I was in the last year of my contract.                                         “I had surgery on the foot in the summer, but I had a poor rehab and feel I was neglected.                                         “With what I know now about the medical team here at Cheltenham, I feel bitter about how I was treated at Plymouth then because I wasn’t even given a programme and I deserved better.                                         “I had 12 steroid injections in the area just to get back on the pitch, but that was far more than you are supposed to have in your whole career.                                          "I was trying to do well and help the lads because they were chasing the play-offs.                                         “Even though I was unfit and struggling with my foot, I could still produce moments out of the blue and the manager wanted me on the team sheet, even if I could only come on for 10 minutes here and there.”                                         Reid continues to struggle with his feet, but he has been aided greatly by Cheltenham’s fitness coach Josh Harris.                                         “It’s an ongoing process for me, but Josh has so much knowledge and he’s given me five exercises which have allowed me to take all the orthotics out of my boots.                                         “My feet are pretty messed up and a weird shape, especially the left one and I have to wear a wide size 12 because of bunions, so they are funny, but a part of me.”                                         There was a significant period of Reid’s career when every step he took felt like he was “treading on a marble”.                                         “I went to see the leading expert James Calder in Basingstoke and he told me I had a condition called Morton's neuroma.                                         “He took the sensation away by cutting out a compressed nerve, but I still have a dislocated toe because if he’d reattached that I’d have been out for an extra three months.                                         “He won’t touch my bunions either because he said it’s a horrible operation and I should wait until I’ve retired, so I just get on with it.”                                         Reid regained some form after his foot surgery, but he was then dealt another blow with another quad injury against Accrington Stanley and Argyle lost in the play-off final to AFC Wimbledon at Wembley.                                         “I was then offered a contract on the same money, despite scoring 50 goals, winning player of the year, being in every team of the year and manager’s player of the year so that was not acceptable.”                                         In the summer of 2016, Reid found himself a free agent and despite interest from a long list of clubs, nothing could be agreed.                                         “I was probably badly advised at this time and I read something on social media about me failing a medical at Notts County, which was rubbish.                                         “About 10 games into the season I was still sitting at home and training on my own.                                         “Clubs started to think there must be something wrong and I was only offered contracts until January.                                         “I ended up doing my own deal in the end and I had a medical at Fleetwood, but I decided it was too far from home and I hadn’t enjoyed being so far away at Oldham.                                         “I made the decision at that stage I was going to stay at home and I had to be able to commute.”                                         The call then came from Plymouth’s Devon rivals Exeter City.                                         “It’s not like I am Luis Figo or Sol Campbell, so I didn’t think it would be a big deal, but I was wrong.                                         “It all blew up when I signed and some of the abuse I got was uncalled for, but sorry to whoever thought I’d disrespected them and it was never a case of sticking two fingers up at Plymouth.                                         “It was a job opportunity for me to be happy with my family and people need to understand that.                                         “My kids were in school and we had a car school from Bristol to Exeter.”                                         Reid enjoyed a successful first season at Exeter, whose season ended in play-off final defeat by Blackpool at Wembley.                                         “It was amazing and there was a real camaraderie and togetherness in the squad that year.                                         “I got myself fit and played well, scoring 14 goals and we just missed out.                                         “The manager (Paul Tisdale) said he felt I could do more for him, but I was part of the best front three in the division along with Ollie Watkins and David Wheeler.                                   *[FT]: Financial Times

This will directly lead to the design and construction of the field pilot plant that will be used to test the Company's DLE technology at a pre-commercial scale, anticipated to be operational in 2021. The field pilot plant is estimated to cost approximately CAD 3.0 million and will demonstrate our DLE process at existing brine production in Alberta. The current development work is funded through E3's existing working capital and the proceeds of E3 Metals' ongoing financing will be used to fund the pilot plant construction as well as to upgrade a portion of the Company's 7.0 million tonnes of lithium carbonate equivalent (LCE) inferred mineral resources. E3 has also put in an application to a provincial government grant in Alberta to fund our project to a total of C$2.4M in net proceeds.

The only thing better than a big cup of coffee in the morning is a big cup of coffee in the morning that's _free_. Starbucks has different promotions that get customers free drinks pretty often, but for the month of December, the chain will be specifically honoring frontline and healthcare workers with free drinks as a token of appreciation.            Since March, these are the people who have been working endless hours on the frontline of the COVID-19 pandemic. As the pandemic continues and cases rise throughout the country, Starbucks wants to give those helping keep their communities as safe and healthy as possible a little something to say thank you.             Throughout the month of December, healthcare workers can claim a free tall-sized brewed coffee--hot or iced. Earlier this year, Starbucks offered a similar deal and said that "any customer who identifies as a first responder or frontline worker supporting the health care industry" qualifies for the free drink.             As the holiday season is in full swing, it's important to consider how your actions can directly affect others in your community. The CDC continues to suggest minimizing any person-to-person contact and has said holiday gatherings should include only those people who are a part of your immediate household. There are also a number of food-related charities you can support this upcoming holiday season if you feel inclined to do so, and if you have any healthcare workers in your life, be sure to show them some extra gratitude for all the work they've done this year.

“We were going well that season and I think we went something like 16 games unbeaten at the start and I was top scorer, with Doidgey now at Bolton,” Reid says.                                         “I thought we were going to walk the division, but playing away at Northampton I blocked a ball and my knee and ankle ballooned.                                         “I missed a few games and the manager asked if I could do 20 minutes, but I wanted to be pain free after all the issues I’d had with my foot.                                         "The manager said he needed me, so I ended up playing and while I wasn’t terrible, I remember one Trophy game against Arsenal and I couldn’t move.                                         “With my body type, I if I am not active, it’s almost like training isn’t enough for me and that’s why I have a gym at home.                                         “People can’t question my professionalism now because I’m always doing extras on the bike or treadmill.                                         “Anyway, there were then whispers of Doidgey coming back and I was looking forward to playing with him.                                         “The knee was not right, but I was still our top scorer and wanted to finish the season well.                                         “But I was pulled by the manager after one game and told Cheltenham wanted me on loan and it was up to me if I wanted to go.                                         “He told me about Shawn McCoulsky coming in and that he didn’t feel they were playing to my strengths, but I wanted to prove I was the one who needed to play.                                         “I said I’d be ready when needed, but I didn’t feature after that.

Over the past three weeks, global rating agencies such as S&P; Global and Moody's have been warning that the Indian banking sector may not have come out of the woods yet. While they agree that the bad loan levels of FY18 may repeat, the gross non-performing assets (NPA) at 7.6 per cent in September quarter (Q2) isn't telling the entire story either. September quarter (Q2) was helped by two months of moratorium and subsequently by the Supreme Court's intervention on NPA recognition. "For the banks, their NPAs would have generally been higher by 10-60 basis points (bps), in the absence of the court ruling. And for finance companies, this differential was somewhat greater," say analysts at S&P; Global.

The 2020 General Election is officially in the books. Members of the Board of State Canvassers reviewed and approved the results of the statewide election. No major problems were noted in the Canvass Board review.


  Four NRD state races qualified for an automatic recount, however, the candidates who were behind in three of the contests waived their right to an automatic recount. A recount for Lower Platte North NRD Sub 5, where the candidates are separated by one vote, will still occur on Dec. 2, with the results of that election to be certified during the next Canvas Board meeting Dec. 4.


  Secretary of State Bob Evnen opened with a few remarks regarding the success of the general election amid a coronavirus pandemic. “The November 3rd general election was historic in a number of respects. More Nebraskans voted in our 2020 general election in the history of our state.” Evnen added, “Nebraska polls were open, and our voters and poll workers were kept safe. This was all accomplished within the existing legal framework in our state. Nebraska voters refused to allow the coronavirus pandemic to prevent them from exercising their right to vote.”

Further, the “whack-a-mole” lockdown strategy can be capricious and invite confusion. A local county is not a light switch that governors can flicker on and off. Small business owners who survived the first deluge of lockdowns are barely staying afloat as it is. Slapping on more restrictions based on an infection rate standard set by public health officials spells countless, costly logistical problems. Closing down schools on short notice, as was the case in New York City before a partial reversal, is costly for students, first and foremost, and working parents, who must adjust to new schedules.

Bill (William) Dale Shipley, 61, Nodaway, passed away Nov. 20, 2020.        Bill D. Shipley was born Jan. 24, 1959, in Corning, the son of Malcolm A. and Emma Jeanne (March) Shipley. He grew up on the farm in the Nodaway area with his family and three brothers. He enjoyed wonderful childhood memories there raising sheep, hogs, and cattle. He enjoyed hunting, trapping, and fishing and anything to do with the outdoors throughout his entire life.         Bill graduated from Villisca High School, Class of 1977. As a child he was active in Cub Scouts and Boy Scouts. He played football, trumpet, and tuba in the band along with being very active in the Reno Smith FFA Chapter. He was especially proud of his FFA Conduct of Meetings team that received a Gold at State competition. He received his Iowa FFA Farmer Degree in 1977. Following high school graduation, he attended Southwestern Community College and graduated with a degree in farm management.         After college, he married his high school sweetheart, Diane (Herzberg) Shipley on Aug. 14, 1982, and they settled just north of Nodaway and shortly after moved to the house and farm they still reside in today. They celebrated 38 years of marriage in August. Bill and Diane raised their family on the farm north of Nodaway. They were blessed with three children, Kyle, Alyssa, and Trever. With Bill's help and encouragement, all three kids were in FFA and Adams County 4-H with many livestock projects. Bill received the Adams County Young Farmer's Award in 1997.         Bill was a very active member of the community and served as the Adams County Soil and Water Conservation District Commissioner for 19 years, serving as Chairman from 2002 to 2017, and became Vice Chair 2017 to current. He also was an Adams County Conservation Board member, holding all the offices over the 12 years he served. He was instrumental in building the cabins, cottages and new shop at Lake Icaria and other improvements. He was a true conservationist. He was Director of District 7 on the Iowa Soybean Association board for eight years and was President (2017) and President-elect (2016) and was currently an active board member. He was a leader and promoter of agriculture all over the world during this time and believed in the importance of establishing relationships with other countries as he hosted and toured many different groups from other countries, traveled extensively, making friends all over the world. He was also an active member of the Mt. Calvary Lutheran Church and served as officer and elder there, in addition to being an active member of the FFA Alumni at Villisca. Bill was the Nodaway Cemetery Manager/Caretaker for 15 years, past Nodaway fireman, United Mercantile Co-op Board member, Blue Jay Boosters Club, Pork Producers, Adams County Fair Board and countless other area board and committees over the years.         Bill started his lifelong pursuit and passion of farming in 1979 in the Nodaway area. He helped many local farmers while growing his own operation. His operation grew to encompass hogs, corn, soybeans, cattle, and hay as well, in addition to providing custom work for local area farmers including his family. He took over the Pioneer Seed Dealership from his father and sold Pioneer seed for many years. Bill continued to expand and grow his operation over the decades by being a savvy businessman and farmer and eventually was able to include his sons, Trever, for the past 10 years, and Kyle, in more recent years, who both had developed a strong passion for agriculture since they were little growing up on the farm helping their dad. He loved helping raise show pigs with his son Trever and was instrumental in all those successes at county, state, and national shows. He received the Iowa Farm Environmental Leader Award in July 2016 for his conservation practices on his farms, as he was dedicated to farming the ground in a responsible and sustainable way, including being one of the very first area farmers to practice no-till farming in the early '90s in which we still do today.         Bill was not only a great person, but also a cherished husband, beloved father, and an awesome grandfather. He did everything with his kids, from braiding his daughter's hair before school to helping the boys make their Boy Scout derby cars. You could guarantee to see Bill and Diane sitting together at every school function the kids participated in, no matter what. He also supported his daughter's interests in 4-H, love of animals, and the arts. Bill recently spent a lot of his time dedicated to teaching his grandkids. He could never give enough ranger, combine and tractor rides. He always made time to take his kids fishing and carried on the tradition with the grandkids. He had many memories raising pigs and created many more with his son, Trever, with the two of them finding so much joy sharing the newly born piglets with the grandkids to get a bucketful of giggles.         He also enjoyed driving his Dodge Challenger convertible from high school in the local parades. It was the car he drove when he and Diane went on their first date. He kept it all these years. He also was an avid Iowa State Cyclone football fan, attending games with family and friends over the years.         Bill was preceded in death by his father, Malcolm Shipley; and his brothers, Dennis, and Donald Shipley. He is survived by his wife of 38 years, Diane (Herzberg) Shipley; his son, Kyle Allen Shipley and wife, Allison of Nodaway, with their three children, Hunter, Easton and Addison; daughter, Alyssa Marie (Shipley) Munstermann and her husband Matt of Pleasant Hill, and their two daughters, Haddie and Wyn; son, Trever William Shipley of Villisca; his mother, Emma Jeanne Shipley, of Nodaway; brothers, Tom Shipley of Nodaway; Clifford (Vicki) Shipley of St. Joseph, Ill.; and Leland (Amy) Shipley of Nodaway: his father-in-law and mother-in-law, Darrel and Mavis Herzberg; brother-in-law, Chris (Jami) Herzberg of Charlotte, N.C.; brother-in-law, Steve (Kristen) Herzberg of Ankeny; and many other nieces, nephews, cousins, and friends.        Those who wish to remember Bill in a special way may make gifts in his memory to the Bill Shipley Scholarship Fund or Southwest Valley FFA Chapter.

While the rule of thumb is to put enough into a savings account to cover three to six months' worth of expenses, some of us are now thinking we need more. After all, an emergency fund can deplete quickly, and the more we put away, the easier it will be to rest at night.

Additionally, much like methods to contain COVID-19 have received public and political pushback, practices that had proven effective in slowing the spread of AIDS faced intense scrutiny. In its Feb. 15, 1988, issue, TIME highlighted criticism of a new NYC plan to give drug users sterile needles, quoting Harlem pastor Rev. Calvin Butts arguing that "To distribute needles is to cooperate with evil. It is a step to legitimatizing heroin use."


  Two years later, at the Sixth International Conference on AIDS, experts still marveled at the still "hostile" resistance to efforts to educate young people about safe-sex practices, especially from conservative U.S. Senator Jesse Helms (R-NC).


  "Wide use of condoms and distribution of sterile needles to addicts could stall the epidemic. But efforts to encourage such measures have been hampered by conservative politicians, who are squeamish about sex education and clean- needle programs," TIME reported in the July 2, 1990, issue.


  In the Feb. 16, 1987, issue TIME reported, "Conservative leaders see it as a summons to chastity or monogamy. Many people, dealing with the absolute death sentence that AIDS imposes, consider it a vague sort of retribution, an Old Testament-style revenge…An Atlanta executive concludes, 'We are paying for our sins of the '60s, when one-night stands and sex without commitment used to be chic.'"


  Another tragic similarity between AIDS and COVID-19 is how each has disproportionately affected Black and Latino populations. By and large, the highest rates of new HIV cases are in the southern states that did not to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. The highest rates exist where the poorer, rural medical centers are less equipped with the latest drugs and treatments, and which treat patients who can't afford them. "Communities of color and African-American communities have never gotten the resources that they need to fight the epidemic effectively," says Dan Royles, historian and author of _To Make the Wounded Whole: The African American Struggle against HIV/AIDS._ "The changes that would be necessary are systemic."
