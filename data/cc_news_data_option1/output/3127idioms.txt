But that seems unsatisfyingly wasteful because most of the energy that the sun radiates is in the green part of the spectrum. When pressed to explain further, biologists have sometimes suggested that the green light might be too powerful for plants to use without harm, but the reason why hasn't been clear. Even after decades of molecular research on the light-harvesting machinery in plants, scientists could not establish a detailed rationale for plants' color.

Another critical point that Amaechi did not reckon with is that you can only take chances with the Chinese at your own risk and peril. Whereas they do not take nonsense when something concerns them, they do not care about serving others shit. Their laws are unsparing of crimes and criminals in their own country, with people getting the death penalty despite the growing global calls for its abrogation. The Chinese would take none of that. But that is in so far as their country is concerned. For other countries, anything goes. This is unlike the West. Despite whatever criticisms one may have against them, they still have ways of punishing their own companies which commit infractions even outside their countries.

 The ammonium nitrate, a chemical used in fertilizers and explosives, originated from a cargo ship called MV Rhosus that had been traveling from the country of Georgia to Mozambique in 2013. It made an unscheduled detour to Beirut as the Russian shipowner was struggling with debts and hoped to earn some extra cash in Lebanon. Unable to pay port fees and reportedly leaking, it was impounded.
 The first known document about it came on Feb. 21, 2014, three months after its arrival. Col. Joseph Skaff, a senior customs official, wrote to the customs authority’s anti-smuggling department warning that the material — still on board the ship docked at port — was “extremely dangerous and endangers public safety.”

Recently, however, in the pages of _Science_ , scientists finally provided a more complete answer. They built a model to explain why the photosynthetic machinery of plants wastes green light. What they did not expect was that their model would also explain the colors of other photosynthetic forms of life too. Their findings point to an evolutionary principle governing light- harvesting organisms that might apply throughout the universe. They also offer a lesson that — at least sometimes — evolution cares less about making biological systems efficient than about keeping them stable.

 We are members of Bread for the World, a collective Christian voice calling upon our political leaders in Washington, D.C., to work to end hunger, both domestically and internationally.
 The purpose of this column is three-fold. First, we sketch out how hunger is closely related to three acute challenges -- the coronavirus pandemic, the persistence of racial injustice, and the threat of climate change -- currently being faced by our world. Second, we express gratitude for the many ways that the people of the Holland/Zeeland area are contributing to the resolution of these challenges. Third, we call attention to steps our federal government should take to both reduce hunger and curb the coronavirus pandemic.
 Hunger worsens the coronavirus pandemic by harming the immune system. Children who are not adequately nourished in the first 1,000 days of life (pregnancy though the second birthday), often grow into weak, sickly adults. In the extreme case of starvation, Mike McHargue (\"The End of Hunger\") explains that people who are starving often die from an infection rather than starvation itself, because the food deprivation causes the body to shut down the immune system.
 The coronavirus pandemic worsens hunger, too, as lockdowns and sickness reduce household incomes and cause logistical complications. The World Food Program warns that in 2020 the number of people at risk of starvation may double to 265 million.
 Turning to racial injustice, among its many harmful effects is the vast wealth disparity between racial minorities and whites. The Brookings Institution states that in 2016, the median wealth of a white American household was nearly 10 times that of an African American household. This gap is the result of a long list of unjust public-policy decisions made by our nation. So, racial injustice is a hunger issue, too, because people who lack resources have greater difficulty in putting food on the table. Moreover, people of color are suffering disproportionately from COVID-19; in addition to higher rates of food insecurity and poor health, greater exposure to high-risk occupations has been cited as a cause.
 Similarly, climate change drives hunger. Extreme and unreliable weather makes farming more difficult. While the world still produces enough food to feed everyone, the challenges induced by climate change can destroy the livelihoods of smallholder farmers. Climate change can also make some lands uninhabitable due to rising oceans or desertification. Loss of livelihood and/or habitable land obviously puts people at risk for hunger.
 We are grateful for the many ways our community is addressing hunger and related issues. The Greater Ottawa County United Way, Holland/Zeeland Community Foundation, Movement West Michigan, and Lakeshore Nonprofit Alliance are cooperating to meet area needs arising out of the pandemic. Ottawa Food is a coalition of agencies that cooperate to ensure access to healthy, local, and affordable food. Agencies providing food assistance include the Community Action House, Harvest Stand Ministries, Escape Ministries, and so many more. These nonprofits are currently operating in high gear to meet requests for help.
 We also take heart in the public demonstrations calling for racial justice and in the Holland Zeeland Community Foundation's decision to donate $105,000 toward efforts to reduce racial inequities and implicit bias.
 We are thankful that the Holland City Council is planning to re-evaluate its Community Energy Plan, with an eye to accelerating our city's reductions in our carbon footprint. And, we thank the members of Holland Climate Change Lobby for their frequent Sentinel columns advocating for a market-based Carbon Fee and Dividend policy.
 All these local efforts -- directly or indirectly -- help to reduce hunger. But we need action at the national level too, and we need more of it. So, we close by calling for Congress to pass measures to reduce hunger during this pandemic. First, we want an increase of at least 15 percent in SNAP benefits (food stamps) and other reforms to make SNAP more racially equitable. Second, to help families whose children qualify for free or reduced-price school meals, we call for an extension of the pandemic EBT program. Third, we request an investment of $20 billion toward the global response to COVID-19.
 We are all part of one human family, and our problems are interconnected. By continuing to live in a spirit of solidarity and cooperation, we will bring our world closer to the shalom we all seek.

 She added, "We call upon the White House's negotiators to join us once again at the negotiating table today to secure a bipartisan agreement to put children, families and workers first." In a joint statement with Democratic U.S. Senator Chuck Schumer, she said, "Millions of Americans are still hurting and yet, despite this reality, President Trump and Republicans appear ready to walk away from the negotiating table to do unworkable, weak and narrow executive orders that barely scratch the surface of what is needed to defeat the virus and help struggling Americans."

It is however soul-lifting that Nigerians appear to be showing more interest in a matter like this that is going to affect not only our lives but also those of our coming generations. But, beyond the noise, people should begin to insist that those who took loans on the country’s behalf in the past should be called to account for what they did with the loans. At least those of them that are unfortunate to still be alive. Despite its being blessed abundantly with human and material resources, Nigeria had taken so much foreign loans that it is difficult to remember all of them. The argument has always been that no nation can survive without borrowing, which, for me is bunkum. Or that we are under-borrowing. Nations are not all the same. A country with a working judicial system that promptly punishes crime is different from one like ours where many of its prominent lawyers engage in legal shenanigans to waste the time of our courts and eventually get their corrupt but influential clients off the hook through legal technicalities. We have seen certified thieves being freed by the courts in several instances when it is obvious even to the blind that these highly influential criminals are guilty of the crimes for which they have been accused. Of course the lawyers can only be doing these things in collaboration with their ilk on the bench.

From large trees in the Amazon jungle to houseplants to seaweed in the ocean, green is the color that reigns over the plant kingdom. Why green, and not blue or magenta or gray? The simple answer is that although plants absorb almost all the photons in the red and blue regions of the light spectrum, they absorb only about 90% of the green photons. If they absorbed more, they would look black to our eyes. Plants are green because the small amount of light they reflect is that color.

Gabor and his team developed a model for the light-harvesting systems of plants and applied it to the solar spectrum measured below a canopy of leaves. Their work made it clear why what works for nanotube solar cells doesn't work for plants: It might be highly efficient to specialize in collecting just the peak energy in green light, but that would be detrimental for plants because, when the sunlight flickered, the noise from the input signal would fluctuate too wildly for the complex to regulate the energy flow.

A "Camp Fire" in a town called Paradise. At face value, it all sounded so innocent, so bucolic, a Boy Scout's dream. But it was anything but. The events of Nov. 8, 2018, were closer to a hellish scene conjured by Hieronymus Bosch, a flaming purgatory consuming lives and property in wide swaths with ash so thick it rendered morning night. When the smoke cleared, 85 souls were dead and more than 18,000 structures burned to the ground, along with them, the hopes and dreams of the survivors. What would they do next?
 That question intrigued Ron Howard, who as a child spent time in a similarly idyllic town called Mayberry. With camera in hand, he and his crew descended upon Paradise to spend a year watching a community struggling to rise from the ruins. The result is "Rebuilding Paradise," a riveting chronicle of human suffering trumped by the will to pick up the pieces and move forward. You'd think such a project would be inspiring and hopeful, but what Howard finds is something quite different, a wannabe phoenix often futilely flapping its wings into a headwind of stifling government bureaucracy and unforeseen tragedy.
 His focus is on a handful of residents, among them Woody Culleton, a self- described former town drunk who -- unlike Mayberry's Otis -- rose to become mayor of Paradise; Superintendent of Schools Michelle John and her husband, Phil; hunky police officer Matt Gates and his wife, Tenille; and overworked school psychologist Carly Ingersoll. What they all have in common is more than just the loss of their homes.
 Their stories are wrenching, but the emotion stirring you is one of anger rightfully targeted at FEMA, the logging industry and specifically, Pacific Gas and Electric, whose power lines sparked the Camp Fire, so named for its origins on Camp Creek Road. No less than Erin Brockovich arrives in town to stoke up the residents for a litigious fight against the utility monopoly. And what does the Camp Fire, the largest and deadliest blaze in California history, say about Republicans and their refusal to tackle the ever-pressing issue of climate change?
 It's where Howard's film directs its most furious ire, closing out with unforgettable images of the worldwide destruction being caused by the gradual obliteration of the ozone by the fossil fuel industry. It's a stirring montage capped by December's out-of-control wildfires in Australia that killed a billion animals and scorched millions more acres. Ultimately, Howard wants "Rebuilding Paradise" to scare the bejeezus out of us. And all I can say is, mission accomplished.
 In fact, the film's first 10 minutes, chock full of dash-cam footage of the Camp inferno, are scarier than any horror movie I've seen. This should come as no surprise for anyone recalling the realistic scenes of fire Howard depicted in his 1991 blockbuster, "Backdraft." If a filmmaker knows the lethal power of heat and flame, it's Howard. What you don't expect is the amount of emotion he's able to draw from the aftermath of a natural disaster like few have seen. What we witness is not just the leveling of Paradise -- an ideal, like Eden, once again forsaken by God -- but a hole burned clean through your heart. True to Milton's words, it is indeed a Paradise lost.

President Trump signed four executive orders Saturday intended to bypass Congress to provide economic relief to Americans during the coronavirus pandemic, under a cloud of uncertainty over whether his office has the power to enact some of these directives.
 One of the executive orders would provide $300 in expanded weekly unemployment checks, with states asked to foot another $100, using money from the Disaster Relief Fund under FEMA. The order is intended to partially extend coronavirus relief in the CARES Act, which provided $600 in weekly federal unemployment benefits and expired at the end of July after Congress failed to come to a deal to at least partially renew them.
 Trump also signed an executive order to defer payroll taxes for Americans making less than $100,000 through the end of the year, though that would mean those taxes would be owed later unless further action is taken. Trump said he may make those cuts permanent if he is reelected in November, even though Republicans have been against the idea every time he has pushed it this year.
 The other two executive orders would provide eviction protections and extend the suspension of federal student loan payments through December.  
 His announcement was met with confusion, in no small part because Congress alone has the power to authorize funding for different programs, despite Trump's claims of broad economic relief. When asked by reporters at Saturday's press conference about potential legal action against his executive orders, Trump said, "If we get sued, it's somebody that doesn't want people to get money. And that's not going to be a very popular thing."
 Trump repeatedly lambasted Democrats at his press conference from his Bedminster, New Jersey golf club. Talks between Democratic and Republican lawmakers for another coronavirus relief package broke down after weeks of negotiations, and Trump had indicated Friday that he will push aid through using his executive power.
 The plan faced immediate pushback from Democrats.  
 “He’s acting lawlessly," Rep. Jamie Raskin told BuzzFeed News. "He's totally outside of his powers.”  
 "I’ve heard grave concerns from states about this proposal and they are simply going to opt out," Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden said about Trump's plan asking states to pay 25% of weekly unemployment aid. "Their budgets have been crushed. They cannot afford a 25 percent match, especially when unemployment trust funds are under tremendous strain and Republicans oppose funding for state and local governments."
 Trump could not say Saturday when unemployment aid will reach Americans, just that it will be "very rapid."
 "We want it to be very rapid," he said. "It's going to be distributed in a way that — whichever the fastest way, there are various methods and it will be rapidly distributed."
 It's also unclear how long the new expanded unemployment benefits could last, even if they are not legally challenged. In the order, Trump asked for "up to $44 billion" from the Disaster Relief Fund to be made available for the unemployment benefits — that's about as much money as the Treasury Department spent on the $600 expanded benefits in April alone.

A Superior Court judge in California has shut down an effort to halt California’s quota program, which assesses all Grade A milk producers to pay a premium to quota holders.
 Judge James Arguelles denied a petition for a writ of mandate to order the California Department of Food and Agriculture to vacate the Quota Implementation Plan and cease all QIP operations.
 The petition by Stop QIP Tax Coalition argued QIP is invalid because CDFA did not hold a public hearing on the plan before adopting it and did not include it in the state’s pooling plan.
 The quota program harkens back to the state’s Gonsalves Milk Pooling Act of 1967 and pays a $1.70 per hundredweight premium to quota holders. When dairy farmers voted to abandon their state milk marketing program to join the federal marketing order system, USDA allowed the state to continue administering and enforcing a stand-alone quota program.
 The state Legislature granted CDFA authority to establish the program in 2017. Dairy farmers approved the Quota Implementation Plan in a statewide referendum, and both the federal milk marketing order and QIP took effect in November 2018.
 The law authorizing CDFA to establish the stand-alone program was codified in Section 62757 of the state’s Food and Agriculture Code. Stop QIP argued that section cites Sections 62716 and 62717, which outline the referendum process following a required hearing.
 “In petitioner’s view, the citation to Sections 62716 and 62717 was intended to incorporate the hearings referenced in those sections. The court, however, disagrees,” Arguelles stated in his ruling.
 Section 62757 requires the stand-alone program be “approved by a statewide referendum of producers,” and the referendum must be “conducted pursuant to Sections 62716 and 62717.
 “But referendums are not hearings, and the incorporation of referendum provisions in Sections 62716 and 62717 should not be read as the incorporation of every other provision in these sections,” Arguelles stated.
 “As other sections in the statutory scheme demonstrate, the Legislature knows how to insert the word ‘hearing’ into a statute and impose a hearing requirement,” he said.
 “Because Section 62757 does not contain the word ‘hearing,’ and does not expressly incorporate any hearing requirements in another section within the scheme, it does not incorporate the hearing requirements on which Petitioner relies,” he said.
 The judge also shot down Stop QIP’s argument regarding inclusion of the stand- alone program in the state’s marketing order prior to the federal order.
 Section 62757 also states the details of the program shall be included in the pooling plan.
 Stop QIP argued the Legislature must have intended for CDFA to establish the stand-alone program by amending the state marketing order pooling plan and must have intended compliance with hearing procedures required for amendments.
 Arguelles found several faults in the argument.
 “If the Legislature wanted to require a hearing or amendment as part of the establishment of a stand-alone quota program as set forth under Section 62757, it seems much more likely that it simply would have inserted such requirements into the statute,” he said.
 The ruling was the second blow to Stop QIP’s attempts to halt the quota program in a little over a week. On July 27, an administrative law judge found a separate petition by the group calling for referendum on continuing the quota program was “legally defective.”

We are members of Bread for the World, a collective Christian voice calling upon our political leaders in Washington, D.C., to work to end hunger, both domestically and internationally.
   
 The purpose of this column is three-fold. First, we sketch out how hunger is closely related to three acute challenges -- the coronavirus pandemic, the persistence of racial injustice, and the threat of climate change -- currently being faced by our world. Second, we express gratitude for the many ways that the people of the Holland/Zeeland area are contributing to the resolution of these challenges. Third, we call attention to steps our federal government should take to both reduce hunger and curb the coronavirus pandemic.
   
 Hunger worsens the coronavirus pandemic by harming the immune system. Children who are not adequately nourished in the first 1,000 days of life (pregnancy though the second birthday), often grow into weak, sickly adults. In the extreme case of starvation, Mike McHargue ("The End of Hunger") explains that people who are starving often die from an infection rather than starvation itself, because the food deprivation causes the body to shut down the immune system.
   
 The coronavirus pandemic worsens hunger, too, as lockdowns and sickness reduce household incomes and cause logistical complications. The World Food Program warns that in 2020 the number of people at risk of starvation may double to 265 million.
   
 Turning to racial injustice, among its many harmful effects is the vast wealth disparity between racial minorities and whites. The Brookings Institution states that in 2016, the median wealth of a white American household was nearly 10 times that of an African American household. This gap is the result of a long list of unjust public-policy decisions made by our nation. So, racial injustice is a hunger issue, too, because people who lack resources have greater difficulty in putting food on the table. Moreover, people of color are suffering disproportionately from COVID-19; in addition to higher rates of food insecurity and poor health, greater exposure to high-risk occupations has been cited as a cause.
   
 Similarly, climate change drives hunger. Extreme and unreliable weather makes farming more difficult. While the world still produces enough food to feed everyone, the challenges induced by climate change can destroy the livelihoods of smallholder farmers. Climate change can also make some lands uninhabitable due to rising oceans or desertification. Loss of livelihood and/or habitable land obviously puts people at risk for hunger.
   
 We are grateful for the many ways our community is addressing hunger and related issues. The Greater Ottawa County United Way, Holland/Zeeland Community Foundation, Movement West Michigan, and Lakeshore Nonprofit Alliance are cooperating to meet area needs arising out of the pandemic. Ottawa Food is a coalition of agencies that cooperate to ensure access to healthy, local, and affordable food. Agencies providing food assistance include the Community Action House, Harvest Stand Ministries, Escape Ministries, and so many more. These nonprofits are currently operating in high gear to meet requests for help.
   
 We also take heart in the public demonstrations calling for racial justice and in the Holland Zeeland Community Foundation's decision to donate $105,000 toward efforts to reduce racial inequities and implicit bias.
   
 We are thankful that the Holland City Council is planning to re-evaluate its Community Energy Plan, with an eye to accelerating our city's reductions in our carbon footprint. And, we thank the members of Holland Climate Change Lobby for their frequent Sentinel columns advocating for a market-based Carbon Fee and Dividend policy.
   
 All these local efforts -- directly or indirectly -- help to reduce hunger. But we need action at the national level too, and we need more of it. So, we close by calling for Congress to pass measures to reduce hunger during this pandemic. First, we want an increase of at least 15 percent in SNAP benefits (food stamps) and other reforms to make SNAP more racially equitable. Second, to help families whose children qualify for free or reduced-price school meals, we call for an extension of the pandemic EBT program. Third, we request an investment of $20 billion toward the global response to COVID-19.
   
 We are all part of one human family, and our problems are interconnected. By continuing to live in a spirit of solidarity and cooperation, we will bring our world closer to the shalom we all seek.

It's difficult to imagine that anyone has been financially untouched by the COVID-19 pandemic and economy-closing efforts to contain it. Job losses and income cuts are an obvious example, but many people will be hurt in other ways, and the impact could linger for years.
 Some Americans, for example, will see an erosion in their credit scores, affecting their ability to borrow on good terms, while others could fall further behind in retirement preparedness. Income-tax perils and other dangers also lurk.
 With a spike in the nation's jobless rate, many Americans now find themselves pinched by lower incomes. Some individuals weren't able to build an emergency fund even when times were good. "People who were living paycheck to paycheck do not have the financial cushion to absorb a shock of this magnitude," McKinsey & Co. said in a report.
 Even before the pandemic hit, about 40% of Americans reported that they couldn't cover an unexpected $400 expense without borrowing or selling assets, McKinsey noted, citing a widely quoted Federal Reserve study. The COVID-19 outbreak has made money issues more worrisome for people in this group.
 Many unemployed individuals have become dependent on stimulus checks and expanded jobless benefits - two programs that seem likely to be extended, with details still pending.
 Losing ground on retirement
 For a while, it looked like millions of investors and their 401(k) retirement accounts would get wiped out by the stock-market plunge triggered by the sudden coronavirus recession and economy-shutting measures to contain it. That doesn't appear to be the case anymore, with the market inching up to near its former highs. But many people still will lose ground in retirement planning.
 Individuals who lost jobs, were forced to take temporary furloughs or had their 401(k) matching funds cut will have fewer contribution dollars flowing into their retirement accounts. Worse, some investors have tapped their accounts for loans or permanent withdrawals, removing money that could have bounced back with the stock market.
 Then there's the lure of claiming Social Security benefits as soon as possible, for anyone who has reached age 62. People who face job disruptions might be forced into this predicament. But claiming Social Security early comes at a cost, as monthly benefits rise over time for people who can afford to wait (up to age 70).
 Even before the virus hit, half of all American households were at risk of falling short in retirement savings, said the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College in a recent report. Many people now "face a larger savings gap," with retirement at-risk households jumping to 55% from 50% before.
 Less obvious than stock-market volatility, lower interest rates also pose a danger. At today's depressed yield levels, retirees and other savers will find it difficult just to keep pace with inflation.
 Facing an uncertain tax situation
 One silver lining to all of these disruptions is that many people could face a lower burden when it comes time to filing federal and state income-tax returns early next year. To the extent you suffered a job loss or reduced hours, for example, your taxable income for 2020 could be considerably less than it was for 2019.
 Just be aware that unemployment benefits are taxable, so plan for a tax bill later if you were thrown out of work and didn't have enough money withheld. Another danger awaits anyone who permanently withdrew money from 401(k) plans or traditional Individual Retirement Accounts -- or those who can't repay a 401(k) loan. In general, this money is taxable, and you might face a 10% penalty if you pulled it out before age 59 1/2.
 Then there's the Internal Revenue Service, which was tasked with issuing stimulus checks during the middle of tax-return filing season -- just as its own offices were closing to help slow the spread of the virus. The resulting delays in processing returns and issuing refunds caused hardships for some people.
 This episode should have you rethinking the wisdom of over-withholding taxes in hopes of getting a big refund quickly, if you're counting on the money to help make ends meet.
 Dealing with credit-report problems
 As more people struggle with their finances, problems have shown up as credit- report demerits and lower credit scores.
 LendEDU analyzed the volume of complaints fielded by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau from March 13 to July 17. Complaints surged during that period, with gripes about credit scores and reports accounting for more than half the total.
 Besides more people having trouble making payments, the spike in complaints points to a communication breakdown among consumers, lenders and the three credit bureaus.
 "Many financial institutions were flexible with borrowers and agreed to things like a reduced minimum payment or even a deferment period," noted Mike Brown, who wrote the LendEDU report. "However, it appears that many of these agreements were never really confirmed or finalized."
 In some cases, credit-card companies reduced available borrowing limits for people who reported payment difficulties, resulting in a hit to their credit scores (which drop when more of a person's remaining credit has been utilized). In other cases, lenders or credit bureaus added erroneous information to consumer files.
 All of which underscores the wisdom of checking your credit reports occasionally -- you can do so for free at annualcreditreport.com -- and alerting the bureaus if you spot errors. Services such as CreditWise that provide near-instant monitoring of scores also can be helpful, Brown said.
 Coping with more stress
 The coronavirus financial fallout appears to have contributed to greater anxiety. Americans polled recently by Charles Schwab rated their financial stress at an average 52.5 on a scale of 0 to 100 (where increased stress equates to higher scores), up from 45.9 in January. A lot of people expect their money worries to remain elevated even after the outbreak subsides.
 Many Americans also might be thinking a bit differently about money in the wake of the pandemic. Respondents in the Schwab survey say it now takes fewer assets than before to be comfortable - an average $655,000 in net worth in the June survey compared to $934,000 in January. True wealthy status starts at around $2 million in net worth, respondents now say, down from around $2.6 million in January.
 The report didn't explain why people have scaled back their measures of affluence, but a lot of Americans likely have lowered their expectations and aspirations.

This is not actor James D'Arcy's first encounter with writing and directing a film. He had that experience a few years ago with an oddball comic short titled "Chicken/Egg,' which starred Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, then in his sixth season as Jamie Lannister on "Game of Thrones" (the short is currently available on YouTube). D'Arcy, making his name as a quiet, but dashing screen presence since the late-1990s, had been writing feature scripts for years, and came close to directing one of them, but "Made in Italy" was the first to have all of its pieces fall into place.
 And his feature debut behind the camera is a rarity - a sweet and funny and charming and very positive movie that's not filled with cliches. His story teeters close to the edge of a couple of them, but never falls into the abyss.
 With a small cast of mostly likable characters, and a scattering of good-for- nothings to make the nice folks look even better, D'Arcy's story introduces Jack (Micheal Richardson), the manager of a London art gallery, and his soon- to-be ex-wife Ruth (Yolanda Kettle) - one of the nasty characters - whose family owns the gallery and is now selling it, leaving Jack out in the cold.
 What's a gallery manager who is going through a messy divorce, has no other career skills, has been sad and lost since his mother died in an accident when he was 7, and has no relationship, beyond an estranged one, with his aloof father, to do?
 Well, look up dad, take a drive with him to their abandoned old family home in gorgeous Tuscany, sell the place, and have enough money to buy the gallery from his wife's family, of course!
 You might wonder if the uncomfortable presence between the father and the son will somehow work out, or if the bitterness emanating from the son's bad marriage will lead to some kind of happiness for him, or if the mission to Italy will result in dreams coming true back home. Those are common and expected story arcs in small, arty films like this.
 But "Made in Italy" depends as much on characters and their development as it does in the stories going on around them. It was a spot-on decision to have son Jack and father Robert be played by real-life son and father Micheal Richardson and Liam Neeson. It's not that there's that much of a physical similarity, but it clearly comes across that these two men know and understand each other, and everything clicks when they step into character, even when their roles call for two people who do not know each other very well. That's called good acting.
 Their arrival in the little Tuscan village where the house has been empty for 20 years signals that it's time to introduce some comedy - Richardson proves to be adept at pratfalls - and some other characters - it's not long before we meet beautiful restaurant owner Natalia (Valeria Bilello) and business-minded estate agent Kate (Lindsay Duncan), along with a few assorted and rather colorful local characters.
 In short order, the plotlines kick in: Do we fix up this dust heap or do we sell it as is? Or do we keep it? Arguments between father and son on those topics ensue. Is Jack getting a little crush on Natalia, even though she has a daughter with her and an ex-husband nearby? Can Robert, once a well-known painter who walked away from it all, ever come back to the limelight?
 And then the father-son problems are plopped down in the middle of it all. Did supposedly carefree Robert abandon Jack when his wife died? Will sullen Jack ever figure out a way to get back with his dad? More important, does he even want to?
 Amidst regular doses of drama and goofiness, all played out at a slow, smooth pace, with gentle music pushing it along, "Made in Italy" emerges as a story about unhappy people in a beautiful place, and how they're affected by it. There are misunderstandings and there are squabbles, and there's an enjoyable and impossibly happy ending. And even that doesn't feel like a cliche.
 "Made in Italy" opens in select theaters and will be available on most VOD and cable platforms on Aug. 7.

It's Sunday morning, Oct. 4, and the 3-0 Eagles are waking up in their hotel just outside San Francisco to the news that 12 of their players had tested positive for COVID-19, rendering them ineligible for that night's game against the 49ers.
   
 The game was being billed as a showdown of undefeated teams on Sunday Night Football.
   
 Instead, the game is postponed while the Eagles have to quarantine at their hotel until the NFL clears them to return home. The Eagles are supposed to play the Steelers the following week.
   
 Forget about practicing. The Eagles will be stuck for at least a few days in San Francisco. Who knows if they'll be cleared in time to play?
   
 This is what the NFL could become during this 2020 season in the midst of a coronavirus pandemic.
   
 We're already seeing it in Major League Baseball, another sport that is not operating in a bubble.
   
 Already, the Marlins and Phillies have had more than a week's worth of games postponed after an Marlins outbreak that saw 18 players and two staffers test positive. The Phillies never had a positive test, but they were the Marlins' opponent when the outbreak occurred.
   
 And the St. Louis Cardinals are in the midst of a week off after as many as 13 players and staffers have tested positive.
   
 The Eagles are currently dealing with the situation now as head coach Doug Pederson is quarantining after testing positive on Sunday night. Right tackle Lane Johnson, starting linebacker Nathan Gerry and backup tackle Jordan Mailata are on the NFL's Reserve/COVID-19 list.
   
 There's no word on when any of them can return.
   
 In all, the NFL Players Association announced that 56 players around the NFL have tested positive since reporting for training camps. There were 107 positive tests during the offseason.
   
 That seems like a relatively small number, all things considered.
   
 The same is true among players opting out of the season. In all, there have been 65, with the most occurring on the New England Patriots, who have lost eight players. The Eagles have lost only one, wide receiver Marquise Goodwin.
   
 Eagles defensive tackle Fletcher Cox, for one, said he never considered opting out.
   
 "I knew I was playing," he said. "I love this game so much, and I knew from talking to guys around this organization, just feeling safe was the biggest thing."
   
 That is why the NFL might just be able to pull this season off, or at least in a better fashion than MLB has done so far.
   
 Already, the NFL already canceled the preseason games, meaning that no NFL teams will travel until the regular season starts the weekend of Sept. 10.
   
 Sure, MLB used that strategy for the three-week summer camps at each team's home ballpark without a problem. The outbreaks occurred when the regular season started and teams started traveling.
   
 The Marlins were in Atlanta for exhibition games, and team CEO Derek Jeter said some players went out for some milk.
   
 It's been reported that the Cardinals were at a casino.
   
 But NFL teams aren't on the road for a week to 10 days going to two or three different cities during that time. NFL teams will travel to an away game on a Saturday and return home after the game on Sunday.
   
 Instead of going out for dinners or milk, teams will have to eat in their hotel. For one night over eight road trips, that's a small sacrifice to make.
   
 "There will be ups and downs," Cox said. "There are things we have to adapt to and get used to. We know there are changes, and we can't let that distract from our main goal, starting the season and finishing."
   
 The NFL is formulating contingency plans if a team, or multiple teams, should have an outbreak.
   
 But as MLB has shown, you can't plan for everything.
   
 According to USA Today's Jarett Bell, it's possible that a game can be postponed if a position group is unavailable.
   
 An entire week's schedule can be wiped out if 10 or more games can't be played. And the season can be suspended if six or more teams can't play for multiple weeks.
   
 But the NFL also has flexibility in its scheduling.
   
 MLB is steadfast in making sure the regular season ends by Sept. 27 and the playoffs by the end of October, citing the possibility of COVID-19 outbreaks around the nation during the cold and flu season.
   
 The NFL can postpone games, and then tack them on at the end of the regular season in January or February. It can extend the playoffs into March and hold the Super Bowl in April if that's what it takes.
   
 NFL players and coaches need to be vigilant. All it takes is one person to get careless for an outbreak to occur. And yes, the chances of that are greater as NFL rosters are  twice as big as MLB rosters.
   
 There are also many more coaches, strength and conditioning staff, as well as equipment that constantly needs to be washed and sterilized.
   
 But the NFL also has the luxury of seeing what went wrong in baseball, and to adjust.
   
 "You don't want to bring in anything, as far as this COVID situation, into your house," Eagles safety Jalen Mills said. "We have to treat this facility like it is our house. I'm calling you my brother, so I don't want to get you sick.
   
 "I am staying safe outside of this building, so once I come back in this building, I'm not causing a problem, not only for yourself, but anybody else in this building."
   
 Then again, MLB thought it had COVID-19 under control too.

Fluctuations in the Raw Material Prices

"Without dramatic change, there is no end in sight,'' DeJoy said.
 While package deliveries to homebound Americans were up more than 50%, that was offset by continued declines in first-class and business mail, even as costs increased significantly to pay for personal protective equipment and replace workers who got sick or chose to stay home in fear of the virus, DeJoy said.
 Without an intervention from Congress, the agency faces an impending cash flow crisis, he said. The Postal Service is seeking an infusion of at least $10 billion to cover operating losses as well as regulatory changes that would undo a congressional requirement that the agency pre-fund billions of dollars in retiree health benefits.
 The agency is doing its part, said DeJoy, a Republican fundraiser and former supply chain executive who took command of the agency June 15. DeJoy, 63, of North Carolina, is a major donor to President Donald Trump and the Republican Party. He is the first postmaster general in nearly two decades who is not a career postal employee.
 In his first month on the job, DeJoy said, he directed the agency to vigorously "focus on the ingrained inefficiencies in our operations,'' including by applying strict limits on overtime.
 “By running our operations on time and on schedule, and by not incurring unnecessary overtime or other costs, we will enhance our ability to be sustainable and ... continue to provide high-quality, affordable service,’' DeJoy said.
 While not acknowledging widespread complaints by members of Congress about delivery delays nationwide, DeJoy said the agency will "aggressively monitor and quickly address service issues.''
 DeJoy's remarks came as lawmakers from both parties called on the Postal Service to immediately reverse operational changes that are causing delays in deliveries across the country just as big volume increases are expected for mail-in election voting.
 Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said Thursday that changes imposed by DeJoy "threaten the timely delivery of mail — including medicines for seniors, paychecks for workers and absentee ballots for voters — that is essential to millions of Americans.''
 In his remarks to the postal board of governors, DeJoy called election mail handling “a robust and proven process.″
 While there will “likely be an unprecedented increase in election mail volume due to the pandemic, the Postal Service has ample capacity to deliver all election mail securely and on time in accordance with our delivery standards, and we will do so,″ DeJoy said. “However ... we cannot correct the errors of (state and local) election boards if they fail to deploy processes that take our normal processing and delivery standards into account.″
 Later Friday, DeJoy released another memo detailing changes that reshuffle dozens of officials on his executive leadership team. The former chief operating officer, David Williams, was moved to lead logistics and processing operations, while Kevin McAdams, vice president of delivery and retail operations, was removed from leadership.
